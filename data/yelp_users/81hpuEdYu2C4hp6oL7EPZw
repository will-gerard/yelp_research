Maybe I'm just picky but when I have to pump my own coffee from a large container that has been sitting there for who knows how long, I'm thinking it's not the best cup or the best service.  I'm sure it saves them money to be able to just hand you a cup and point to the containers but it's a coffee shop.  They have one job.  Would it be that much of an inconvenience to pour me a fresh cup?

I started going here when they were on Northern and haven't looked back.  I'm not sure why they have a menu as the star of the show is the fresh made pasta.  They bring it by on a plate and tell you what is fresh for the day .  Porcini infused with lobster is hard to pass up but sometimes they have squid ink with seafood which is my favorite.   Service and dessert are middle of the road but I'm there for the pasta!

The last time I came here for lunch it was a disaster.  The pizza was super slow and when it finally arrived it was burnt.   Decided to give them another try since I was in the neighborhood.   The lunch menu hasn't changed and it still has the same dishes - most of which are pretty heavy for a quick lunch.  You can get a small cheese pizza on the lunch menu but no substitutions so no pepperoni pizza.  The dining room is pretty dingy but the bar isn't half bad - which is clearly why everyone sits in the bar.  This time service was much better but the food was so so.    This place was one of the first I can recall to serve a white pizza and it was decent.

I used to come here for gyros, but the spotty food and iffy service were deal breakers.  My buddy said "You have to go now.  The son has totally turned the place around and the lamb shawarma is great."   I went Sat afternoon.  Lamb shawarma sold out.  Maybe it is good.  Hate it when they run out of food at 1pm.    The food was okay, a little on the bland side, but nothing was wrong with it.  The prices are a bit high for what you get, but I guess that's the turnaround plan.  I'm pretty sure I know the whole story of the restaurant as someone (the son maybe) stood and talked to a table about how his costs are down, his staff now listens to him, and there are less items on the menu.  For over 30 mins.  Yeah great ambiance.  If you like the mom and pop everyone knows your name kind of place then you might like Saba's.  I would rather not have to listen to staff talk over my table but maybe that's just me.

My buddy raved about this place and how authentic it was.  So I joined him for lunch.  If a rock hard tamale is your idea of authentic then this is the place for you.  $1 beer if you order lunch.

We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  Picnic and dine under tents on the lawn type of place.  Great time.  Good people watching.  The beauty of this place is seeing the smiles on everyone's face.  They have plenty of large picnic tables, so if you have a family of 12 no problem.  Where else can you get that kind of seating.  They also have small tables for the smaller families.  The area is nicely kept and there were plenty of staff on hand to make sure everyone had an enjoyable day.  The food was pretty standard brunch buffet but the star of the show was the ambiance.  A set of benches with Happy Mother's Day for picture taking was a nice touch.   Mom is still talking about it.

Roy's is a chain that I've been going to for years.   We like to try different places but sometimes you want that place where you know what to expect and still want quality.   It's really my go to place for any occasion.    The fish is always the star for me however I've had a lot of different things on the menu including the filet mignon and the seafood dishes.  The menu changes often, but they always have Ahi tuna and the chocolate souffle is a staple at Roy's.  On Valentines or New Years they usually do a prix fixe.   The service is good and the ambiance is just right.  Not too casual but not too dressy.  I can wear jeans, the Mrs can dress up and we are blending.    I don't really care it's a chain either.  Some of my favorite places are technically chains.  Is Roy's perfect on every visit?  No but you can tell that they try to be top notch.   They do enough and the food is good enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Isn't that really the sign of a good restaurant?

You would be hard pressed to find a better place to eat in the country.  It's starts with amazing views, goes to the hand painted menus each with it's own story, continues into the regionally inspired cocktails and then takes off with the food.  Each dish has just the right touch of Southwest ingredients and they are executed to perfection.  Oysters and caviar - delicious.  Love escargot.  The lobster and foie gras were equally decadent.  Everything was great, but the Buffalo tenderloin is clearly the star.  The service is top notch.  We went for a birthday and they brought out an amazing chocolate souffle for our birthday girl.  Outstanding evening.

Celebrity chef restaurant?  Sounds overrated, but it's not.  The view is amazing, the ambiance is relaxed.  Service is friendly but not as top notch as you would expect.  The food is great.  It's a high end gastro pub asian fusion mash.  My kind of stuff.  Even the sides were great.

I love coming here.  The cuisine is second to none and the great part is that I can bring my own wine.  Every time I come here I know they'll have something that I like, as the menu is laid out in 4 course style with several options for each.    The menu is always sophisticated and food is cooked to perfection.  The place is small enough that if you want your dish cooked just a certain way they have no problem.    Last visit I had bone marrow that I'll now add to my last meal dishes.

Seafood tower, lobster mash, butter cake - love this place.  It's like all the other Mastro's except the menu has the fish at the top and the steak below so no need to feel guilty about ordering steak at a seafood place.     The layout is a bit crappy with the bench.  I actually got seated at a table where the bench splits.  Fortunately an empty table solved that problem.    Service is always good, the portions are a nice size, and the atmosphere is great.  Yelp coupon for free butter cake and cosmo - sweet.

Everyone looks for that little hole in the wall that turns out to be a gem in the rough.  This isn't it.  it's closer to rough than gem.  Food is iffy at best.  Service is borderline.  They have good hours and the chips are relatively fresh so all is not a loss.

If Michelin gave stars in Phx this would be one star for sure (just ignore the dreadful "CaveCreek" booth surrounding the interior).  This place is an amuse-bouche experience.  My favorite was a Vietnamese sandwich so close to authentic yet only an inch sq.  Amazing detail.  The table next to us had different bites than we did and my dining partner was getting mad.  She was mad because she wanted to taste them all.    After having an exploding cherry, I suggested that it was because they were drinking wine and we were having cocktails.  Not just any cocktails - my martini was made with liquid nitrogen - super cold and super cool.  The portions are delicate and like the amuse they were works of art on a plate.    Binkley's actually called the next day to make sure I had an enjoyable dining experience.  I said yes and would like a table for two at 6pm.  So much fun.  Such good food.  Binkley's just made it to my top places to eat list.

NIce atmosphere with lots of reasonably priced wine.  I asked if there was a corkage and my hostess said no but there is a $10 discount if you take it home.  So yes - there is a corkage.  Had the boar chops which the server insisted should be medium or they would be bloody.  Ordered medium rate - at least the cooks know what they are doing.  The chops were cooked nicely.  Unfortunately they were covered with a crappy bbq sauce that almost single handily destroyed the meal.  Fortunately for the crappy bbq sauce there were super salty veggies.  So much salt that they took the honor of destroying the dish.   Too bad - chops were good.

Cranky bar staff and antiquated menu make this a place to skip.    Went to the bar to meet friends for dinner.  Our friends like to use the competing check-in app.  Seems it was offering free drink for first timers.  Ordered my free drink and got a diatribe from the waiter how they would never honor it again.  So much for first impressions.  No wonder they hand out free food for happy hour.     My steak was cooked nicely but the options were minimal.  Mac and cheese in a martini glass - so lame and not very good.  Mashed potatoes that I can get at the neighborhood pub.  My salad was just as uninspiring.  Donovan's calls it classic.  I call it outdated, boring, and bland.  So many better steak houses in town.

When the server tells you order your food now or because I might not be back in an hour you know you are in trouble.  With that encouragement we had a couple of apps, greasy hummus and volcano wings that I think we more like smoldering hill wings.  Except for the Land Shark there is no reason to go back.

Love fish and chips - just not here.  The fish was cooked nicely but totally under seasoned.  My biggest complaint is the watered down vinegar.  If you are going to serve Sarsons in a Sarson container then it should be authentic and original.

Any place that makes you wait shouldn't just throw some chairs and a bench down the hallway.  I'm not sure which is more uncomfortable.  Obviously the owners have never sat there.  It's this we don't really care attitude that permeates the whole place.   One day you get a juicy corned beef sandwich and then next day it's filled with some fatty pieces that are closer to dog food than people food.  I have better luck with food during the weekday than the weekend.  At least I don't have to sit and wait.  Maybe they can't handle a rush.  Do yourself a favor and turn around if they say it will just be a few mins.

Three of us went for dinner.  We ordered the spring rolls that come 2 at a time.  So I asked if they could give us 3 spring rolls instead - just toss on another and charge us for it.  "Oh no.  The cooks won't do that.  You have to get two orders" .  So we get two orders.  We ordered several other items and finally when we were done, we had one spring roll on the table.  When I asked for it to be boxed the server asked if I really wanted it.  Heck yeah - you made me buy an extra one - feel free to box one spring roll.  The service was pretty much like that the whole night.  I'd suggest take-out.  They ask you what kind of spice rating you want - medium, hot, etc.  I'm not sure why, the medium was hotter than the hot which doesn't say much.  There's no Thai spicy at this place.

The first time I went here they totally spaced my order - something about a broken printer.  Good news is they gave me free meal coupons (had to come back - no instant comp).  The bad news was that I went back.  Me and my buddy both ordered beef dishes and we were both praying to the porcelain god that night.  I didn't give it one star because I actually liked the place the first time I went.

I went to Ocean Prime a couple of times when it first opened.  Honestly I wasn't impressed enough to go back, especially given that there is a top notch fish restaurant not too far away.  We ended up here for a friend's birthday and my sorrow quickly turned to joy.  This place has changed and I see they have upped their game.  Service was good.  Wine list had some nice choices and the food was good.    Crab cakes were great.  Scallops cooked perfectly and the swordfish was a great dish.  I've put this place back on my list of places to go.  My only complaint is that if you are gonna offer a moscow mule then it should be in a copper cup.

The service in this place is outstanding.  Any question is always answered with a "yes we can do that".  The atmosphere is relaxing, the view is nice and they serve martinis in a coupe glass.  The potato gratin and oysters are good.  The steaks could be a little more consistent.  Ordering medium rare shouldn't be such a crapshoot.  Front of the house is a bit bogus as they will spread you out even if you request a view.  Once you get to your crappy view table just ask to be moved.

I like the ambiance of Pita Jungle.  It's a nice casual restaurant with faux healthy food.  Usually I eat their grilled chicken and humus.  Get it with the cucumber, tomato and a combination of their three humus.  Pretty tasty humus.  Today I tried the Kafta pizza.  It looked interesting - spicy beef, jalapeno, tomato, onions, pine nuts.  I should have stayed with the chicken and humus.  The Kafta pizza was a greasy mess with non-spicy beef and the jalapeno were nowhere to be found.

Basic burger with so so fries.  I also ordered the rings and I got a blank stare.  Rings, I said again.  Same blank look.  Third time I guessed the problem - onion rings please?  Ah they knew what those were.    The place is dilapidated as gas pumps sitting in the patio. If you don't mind waiting forever and sitting outside where half the heaters are broken, then it's not a bad place to eat.  Just go when it's warm.

The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.

For Mother's Day brunch it's a hit at my house and has been for two years running.  The good measure of any breakfast brunch is the Eggs Bene, it's a tough dish to get right and even harder when they have to sit out.  At this buffet they don't sit for long.  The eggs are cooked great and they take away the old ones if they have been there  long.    The rest of the selection is great with everything you would expect: crab legs, sushi, salmon, pasta, carving stations, omelette station, and desserts galore.  Champagne of course.  The service is great, the ambiance is relaxing, and the outdoor patio is great in the spring.    See you there next Mother's day!

Every time I come here, I'm impressed by menu selections.  Every time I eat here, I wonder why I came back.     Should the mushrooms in a healthy choice omelet really be swimming in butter?  Next time I will order the breakfast burrito stuffed with double tots instead of hash browns.  That seemed to be the popular choice.

This place really is hit and miss with the customer service.  My dealing was with the internet/fleet team.  The sales guy Ian and Shawn were great and very helpful.   Finance guys were very helpful.   We purchased a vehicle new off the lot.  We were looking for something specific and the sales guys found it for us.  We did the paperwork and took possession of the Jeep.  It's then we noticed it had a front license plate which was screwed in 6 places making 6 holes when you remove.  I went back the next day to see if they had some bumper plugs.  I talked to the fleet manager Brandon who basically treated me like I he had some place better to be.  Apparently in the mid-west they all have license plates so I should just deal with it.  Ian showed up and promptly gave me 6 bumper plugs.  Problem easily solved.  Then we noticed that the Jeep was missing parts.  A call to Ian and no problem, he would fix it.  Of course we still don't have all the things that should have come with the vehicle.  There's no checklist of things to do when they give you the car.  They just say adios.  Then we decided to order rock rails from parts.  Al from parts charged my card for the rails and install in advance.  Two days he said, we will call to confirm.  Nobody called.  A few days later I called parts and a new guy said 5-7 days.  A week later no parts.  Called back - it will be two weeks.  Two weeks later - it will be two months.  It's like these guy just click buy in the computer and take your cash.   They won't let us just order with a deposit or call when the parts are in - we had to cancel the order.  100% money up front and we have no idea when you will get your stuff.  Great policy.  Then we needed some service to be completed with the new vehicle.  We contacted service and made an appointment with Bethanne.  As part of our new car purchase we get free rental.  To confirm, we called Bethanne and left a message.  3pm she still hadn't returned our call.  We called back.  Rose said "oh she just went into her office let me transfer you".  Sure enough voice mail.  We called back and this time Rose put us through.  Nope you don't get a loaner or rental.  In the end it turned out we did.  Mark in finance helped us.  Bethanne apparently had something better to do than to check for us.

For some reason this is the only place I can get a seat during the sporting events.  It's a basic bar food place with the usual sporting event markup.  I have been here when the whole place filled up with smoke from the kitchen, which made it hard to see the small TVs they have placed around the bar.  The chicken wings are usually a safe bet.

Ever go to one of those places where the service is so bad it puts a damper on the whole experience?    After we were seated we were informed they were out of pork belly. That was a bummer because I love pork belly.  I don't have a problem with a place running out of an item, as I like stuff that's fresh.  We were then informed of the specials, and immediately Tako dumplings made me forget about the pork belly.  The waitress gave us some time to look over the menu and mentioned it's family style.  A few minutes later the waitress returned and said "Okay we have your items ordered and let me know if you want anything else".  When I explained that we actually never ordered yet she left and came back a couple minutes later.  "That's right you haven't ordered".  We proceeded to order the Tako dumplings and a few other items.  We explained that we've never been here before so we'd like to order a couple of things now and then see how the portions go.  The waitress explained that people usually order 4 dishes per person and if I didn't order them all at once they couldn't control the timing of the dishes.  So we picked the rest of our items.  A few minutes later the waitress returns to say "We are out of Tako".  I asked how they could be out of the dinner special when dinner rush has just started.  "Well it's been on the board all day but when I ordered it they said we didn't have any".  Yep this is a finely tuned restaurant where they can't be bothered to remove an item from "the board".    One of the dishes we ordered was a Shiromi carpaccio which came with focaccia.  The dish had a nicely heated sesame seed oil with garlic - very tasty and perfect for dipping.  If we actually had the focaccia it would have been great for dipping.  10 minutes later out comes the focaccia.  Nice controlled timing of the dishes.  The food here is pretty good.  Some items such as the kimchi with dried shrimp are very tasty.   Others such as the soft shell crab salad are nice ingredients but seem thrown together in a disjointed fashion.     Overall it's a quaint little place with pretty good dishes but you can go elsewhere and easily have a better dining experience.

Every time I come here I'm reminded of a tailgate party.  Not the high-ends ones on the lawn at Cardinals stadium but the park your lawn chair in a parking lot at Sun Devil stadium.  People are friendly enough and it has a local atmosphere, but the beers and food are worse than a cooler and a hibachi.  On tap beers are your basic Bud combo and I swear my sliders were microwaved.   They were brats sliders tho.  What else would you have a tailgate party?

I like the decor of this place.  Sort of looks like Crate and Barrel.  I stopped in for happy hour and it quickly turned to sad hour.  They don't actually have a happy hour.  "But we do have live music".    The bar is nice enough, several "older folks" enjoying themselves.  They have a lot of wine here but nothing outstanding.    I could see they had infused drinks.  Nice!  Nice until the waiter said that it wouldn't be ready for two more days.  Great planning.  "What's on tap?"  "There aren't any beers on tap."  It was right about then that the live music started.  Some cute girl standing behind the bar playing and singing.  Poor thing - you could barely see her through the bottles.   Nice older crowd music.  Onto the food.  Every item less than 475 calories.  I suspect they are more than 475 calories but you will barely eat any of it - ta da - low in calories.   I had a lobster crab spring roll concoction with it's flavor totally replaced by bland.  The rest of the dishes where marginally better.

The coffee is good and the menu, although limited, has some pretty good dishes.    Service is terrible, from the turtle speed hostess to the best buy reject waiters they are just plain bad.  Good news is that the turnover is pretty high so every once in a while you get a good one.  Hostess still moves like molasses.  The other day we went for breakfast and our friend asked the waiter how the sweet potato tots were.   "Amazing", he said,  "Good I will take those", she said   "Oh sorry we are out of tots"  "How are the breakfast potatoes" "Terrible.  I don't eat them.  I get the tots instead.  Now what can I get you?"

They have vallet service right in front of the door.  There is an oyster bar that's pretty small and a bar with music.  Nice menu with your standard seafood steakhouse type dishes.  The portions are nice sized and the crab fried rice as a side but it's a must try.  The fish is fresh, the steak nicely cooked and the desserts are great.  The bananas foster butter cake is my fave.

Service is friendly but the table are pretty squishy.  The small table for two has condiments and a pizza holder which barely leaves room for two plates.  We ordered the antipasto salad and the meatball sub.  Honestly I can make a better antipasto salad.  The meatball sub was a bland as bland can be.   I would have liked to try the pizza but they only server 16".

I have to admit the idea of a mushroom bar appeals to me.  I like mushrooms in particular escargot stuffed mushrooms.  Okay so they don't have escargot but they do have a lot of other stuffed mushroom items.  I ordered the Italian sausage which comes with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.  To be honest I thought I would get a piece of sausage but it was more like a sausage meatball.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't a Schreiner's.    Since I was at a mushroom bar, I had to try the mushroom soup. It was pretty good for the price.   The rest of the menu just didn't appeal to me.  I think I had decided on the sandwich but it wasn't a mushroom sandwich.  We had to leave sooner than expected so I never ordered.  All and all the place isn't bad, but it's not great.  The patio looks a little run down and the service is a touch slow.  The prices are pretty reasonable so if you crave a stuffed mushroom then you can't go wrong here.  Unless it's escargot stuffed mushrooms.

One of my favorite Japanese places is Wakuriya in the Bay Area.  Each dish there is a work of art.  However some are better tasting than others.  ShinBay is the opposite.  The food here is all about quality and taste.  Ask me what dish was my favorite.  Very very tough.  Ask me which one I disliked the most.  I can't tell you.    Don't get me wrong, the presentation was excellent but the food was the star.

Picture yourself walking into a steak house that morphs into a Denny's where you suddenly see a Chinese lantern.  Welcome to Ritz Asia.    The service is friendly but the food is awful.  The shumai tasted like it went straight from the freezer to the microwave to our table.  Trader Joes is better than this.  The spicy tuna roll is an abomination of blender tempura flake mayo orangy...put it this way...looks like garbage tastes like garbage.  Every restaurant at this location closed soon or later.  This will be sooner.  The friendly service can't save them from their crappy chef.

Who doesn't love a gastropub downtown.  The craft drinks are great.  Love the way the drink menu lists the type - shaken, stirred.  Bourbon on tap?  Now you are talking my language.   Bottomless caramel popcorn?  This place is crazy.  The bar is small and a touch crowded.  There is seating in the lobby but it's a little hit and miss with a variety of chairs ranging from big leather to hard cube.  The dining area isn't very big but it has a cool view - if you are into urban views.    The food is nicely portioned.  The short ribs are some of the biggest I've seen.  The pineapple upside down cake is great with the salted caramel topping.

Ordered a box of holiday mini's and 4 cupcakes online.   When I showed up the next day, 2 of the 4 cupcakes weren't available.   "Sorry our flavors didn't come in yet.  Would you like 2 replacements?" "Yes I will take the cookie one" "Sorry we don't have that either" "I'll take a refund on the 2 cupcakes" "Sorry we're not sure how to do that either"  So I took some replacements.  The cupcakes were fresh but little more than dark or white piled (and I mean piled) with some flavored icing  and some sprinkles.

Ordered a beer, got carded, I asked the Manager why since I'm clearly older than 21.  Manager told me it's the law that they see my id.  When I suggested that it's not what the law says he kicked me out.  Great customer service.    Fortunately it's TMP and there's more than one cantina.

Surprisingly good food for a place that calls itself a pub.  The scotch eggs were done with a touch of flair, the shrimp cocktail was better than expected and the organic chicken was great.    I'm used to having bangers and mash for breakfast but what the heck I ordered it for dinner and it was good enough to be an entree.

I'm not sure where the cook got their recipe for red bell pepper hummus but just tossing some red peppers onto the top is like me slapping a "My other car is a Porsche" bumper sticker on my Toyota.  Not only was it fake bell pepper, but I needed a toothpick to get the chickpeas out of my teeth.    Not to be dismayed I tried the meatballs.  I seriously should have quit at the hummus.  I couldn't really tell how many meatballs were on the plate as there was a ton of parm on it and not the nice freshly grated kind.  Clearly the cheese was there to cover the blandness of the  meatballs.  On the plus side, there are lots of TVs to watch sports and the staff is quite friendly.  Alcohol choices are basic but they do have a local brewery on tap.   Once they get the food thing improved it might be a fun place to go.

I love Gastropubs.  Fancy cocktails, craft beers and small bites that are a tad on the heavy side.  This place didn't disappoint.  Blood orange margarita, old fashioned with  maple syrup.  All beers from AZ.  Nice touch.  The triple duck fat fries seemed to be single fried but the egg and dipping sauce were good.  The pate was nice and the bone marrow was rich.  I had the pork belly which was nicely proportioned.  Each item I've had was just a little less than perfect but the prices were more than reasonable.    Ambiance is nice with an open kitchen that seemed to have a small chef's table.  This place has the kind of menu I like and the prices to allow me to stay all night.

Lots of tables with friendly service but it's weird to be asked if I've had sushi before or if I know it's bad luck to pour my own saki.  They have Kirin on tap and a selection of saki but there doesn't appear to be a happy hour.  They have unfiltered saki in various price ranges which I really like so I ordered one unfiltered and one filtered - I got two unfiltered and I wasn't really able to say much before the cap was popped.  Fortunately I like saki.    They have the standard rolls - caterpillar without the tentacles saddens me - but the menu is a touch too casual for me.   I like Mexican food as much as the next guy, but sushi with Doritos or salsa?  I tried them but they were a miss for me.  This location has been a tough sell and I'm not sure Nori will make it.

I like moonshine so when I heard they had flights of shine I was there. Well the flights are really 3 different kinds with a bunch of flavors.  They have a house apple pie.  So much for the exciting flight of shine.    The bbq isn't exactly award winning either.  It's okay and the portions are big enough but there are much better places than this.  St Louis style ribs if you are interested.  They do have some interesting sides which come in fancy little skillets.  I almost thought they served them by themselves as they showed up way before the rest of the meal.  Which brings me to the service - awful.  Had to ask for cutlery. had to ask for our missing mac & cheese - 3 times.  It finally showed.  if the mac & cheese wasn't the best thing in the place I would have said forget it.  Mac & cheese is pretty good.  You can get tortillas instead of rolls with the meal which makes it a bit lighter.

Any place that offers grilled octopus for brunch is a winner in my books.  My octopus was nicely cooked and very tasty.  The chile hollandaise was a nice touch.  The French toast was great and almost seemed like I was eating dessert.  I liked the fact I could get espresso.   The place is pretty cozy with a small patio so you might want to book in advance.

Fresh ingredients but my gyro was slathered in tzatziki sauce and devoid of any real flavor.  The falafel was kind of the same.  I'm not a big fan of the dumb down the spices for the American folk cuisine.

Any place that offers me a cold beverage while I shop gets extra points.  I like the fact that they have a selection of clothes and jewelry that is different than your average store.

They have a good selection but if you're going to call it a jelly filled donut, it should have more than a tablespoon of filling.  My cereal covered donuts weren't much better as the cereal didn't seem to be fresh which sort of wrecked my nicely cooked donut.    The "$5 minimum purchase to use a debit card" sign along with the giant tip jar just screams tacky.

If you're feeling hungry this is the place to go.  They have large portions and you can add-on one of their signature pancake items for just a few more dollars.  I've been here a few times and they somehow seem to make a mistake on the order each time.  The "cooks" screwed up is the excuse.  If you can get past the spotty service, the food is pretty darn tasty.

Parking lot was empty and the valet hassled me to park with him.  I guess they work for tips because I felt like I was in Cabo and he was selling a timeshare.  People parking all around me and this guy was saying I would get towed if I didn't valet.  Great.  Food took forever which is okay if it's done right but the chicken was so overcooked I thought I was eating chicken jerky.  The waffles were just as bad.  Food truck waffles are better than this (I do like food truck waffles).

This place has a great happy hour menu.  The pepperoni sticks alone are worth coming here.  The portions are good and the food is cooked just right.  They have an upstairs patio that has a great view but it's outside so best visited on a pleasant evening.

If you like pancakes then this is the place for you.  Pancake flight and pancake of the day keeps things interesting.  Nice selection of ingredients for their omelets too.  Want things a certain way?  No problem as they seem to excel with custom orders.  Nice selection of "modern" breakfast items.

Giant pie, giant line-up.  Great ingredients and a terrific crust.  Make sure to order the deep dish done right.

I have to keep coming back here to try different flavors - mostly because I load up on salted caramel.  Sometimes I send the daughter and let her decide.  Always fun to see what she brings back.

I don't get this place.  It's cozy enough but that's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  They have a blackboard with  "Craft beers" but they really only have the standard Stone on tap and nothing too exciting in bottles either.  The food is pretty mediocre.  Not really would I consider gastropub fare.  The fish & chips came with the blandest coleslaw I've ever eaten and the chips needed life support.  I didn't even dare try what I could only guess was tartar sauce.  My buddy had a wrap which he described as meh.  The staff was nice enough but not nice enough for me to go back.
