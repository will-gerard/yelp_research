Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.  Zoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.  The food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.  There's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.

This is the most understaffed Subway in Phx.  There is no doubt in my mind that it will easily take me 20 minutes to get in and out of this Subway.  The problem with that is that I am usually trying to catch a movie.  It really gets frustrating to watch one person do all three parts of the job alone while some kid sits in the back and acts like they are busy.    All of that being said, this Subway is consistent and usually tastes good.  The place is always clean and the workers TRY to move you through as fast as possible.

I'm a fan of Hard Rock Cafes.  I don't really know why.  I collect guitar pins from them and have been to 30 or so in my life.  I don't always eat there, but I always go in and check it out.  The Phoenix one is one of the worst I've been to.  The old HRC on Camelback had a bit of personality.  I hated the location, but I loved how wide open it was.  Reminded me of the Honolulu one.  When they moved into downtown, I was excited to see them helping move downtown into the big time.  The location is great and it is a good place to grab a bite before a game.  The food is standard.  Never great, never bad.  Just across the board decent.  My problems with this HRC start with the layout.  The circular design is really bad for traffic flow, seating, wait staff movement, and sound.  This HRC lacks a true performance space which is terribly lame.  The bar is off to the side instead of being in the middle like almost every other HRC.  The shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame.  This HRC is always so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation with your group.    The other problem I have with this HRC stems from an incident where my wife and I went before a game.  She left her hat on the seat when we left and we remembered about 100 yards down the road.  Turned around, went back in, and told the hostess.  She said she would check and then she came back and said they didn't find anything.  I argued with her because we had JUST LEFT and finally went back to our table where it was still sitting in the bench.  Way to go idiot.

Boy this place is annoying.  Every time I go by, they are closed.  They are open ONLY for the midtown lunch crowd and that is it.  We finally got a chance to go during our Xmas break and boy was it good.  I ordered the Bomb Steak which included peppers, onions, cheese, and a lot of meat.  No cheese wiz (too bad) but good white american cheese and a great piece of bread really makes this one of the best phillies in town.  My only complaint is that this place is just so small.  There is so little room to eat or even stand.  They would benefit from a walk-up window for to-go orders.

One of the few places in the up and coming Warehouse District of SoJack you will find Alice Cooper's Town, a beautiful blend of sports and music. Kind of like ESPN Cafe meets Hard Rock Cafe, you've got a great combination that offers quality American bar-style food with an energetic atmosphere.  The waiters are all done up in their best face paint and the walls are full of memorabilia creating one of the most unique places in the city. You will find a two-story warehouse that has been converted into a bar with restaurant along with an adjoining patio.  The food, blessed with possibly the best naming scheme I have encountered is top notch too! Some of my personal favorite named food on the menu:  "The Big Unit" Hot Dog, Ryne Sandburger, Amazing "Grace" Burger, and my personal favorite on the menu - Tommy's Cali Burger.  There is a low carb menu as well as a drinks and dessert.  This is the kind of place where people come to eat before games (there is a south entrance to the arena, if you didn't know, just steps away) and to drink (or sober up) after them. It has a family friendly environment that will make anyone in the family happy to attend.

Thanks to light rail, G&D is now within drinking distance of my house so we decided to try it.  Went for lunch on a Sunday and it was a different feel than what obviously goes on in the evenings.  The music was quiet.  The Cardinals game was on the TV.  The crowd was tame and the setting was peaceful.  Ordered the Bangers and Mash.  It was good but the mash was dry without the gravy and they added peas to the plate which it didn't need.  The sausage was great though.  Guinness on tap so that's a plus.  Would go back but not during a night time crush.  Maybe when MLS season starts up.

I'm really torn on the number of stars this rating should be.  We didn't go inside, so I can't really judge the place.  The drive-thru was full of pigeons having sex which made me tense and uncomfortable.  I didn't have to wait in the Aviary Burlesque House for too long before you took my order and let me get up to the window.  I thought the prices were high for cheap asian food but the quantity was there.    The egg rolls were probably the best I've ever eaten.  I hate egg rolls but I would order one of those again.  My orange chicken, however, was tough and rubbery.  The orange flavor was fine, but those pieces of meat had been sitting out a LOOOONG time.  Too bad too...  I may go back and try something else in the future...but for now, you suck.

Just a classic.  It really is everything you expect from a 60's era diner that is open 24 hours a day.  The food is greasy but good.  The service is impeccable.  There are tons of old people reading newspapers.  And the cinnamon rolls are to die for.    When you don't want to wait in line at Over Easy or Matt's and you're tired of the same stuff at Denny's & IHOP - Jerry's is totally the place to go.  Also, you can spent the entire time thinking about that guy on Seinfeld who always said "Jerry" in that annoying voice.

I had written my original review after the first time I went here.  Since then, I have probably been about 20 more times.  This place is totally a 5 star, bombastic breakfast diner.  The waitress is amazingly quick and on top of things.  I really appreciate that attentiveness in the morning.  The kitchen kicks out food just as quickly and it sure is good.  I've tried the sausage and eggs (which is a giant polish sausage that has been grilled) and "The Bus" (which is a huge piece of ham).  The food is always great and the bill is always under $20 for both of us.  This is our fallback for breakfast now.  No more Denny's or IHOP - ALWAYS JERRY'S.  We even went Christmas morning while waiting for the family to wake up.  This place is top notch.

I'm probably the last person who gives a shit about his haircut but every couple of months it starts to get too hot and I need to get it cut.  Since my "lil sis" Francesca works here, I always go to her.  She does a great job and gets me in and out in in 15-20 minutes.    The place is always clean, it smells good, and is well lit.  It is really a nice looking salon.  The chairs aren't so close together that you can watch the person next to you.  I really like that aspect.  Francesca is great & is way fun to hang out with.  All the other people in there are all douchey.  Anyways, if you want some good lookin hair, go see French over here and she'll hook you up.

This is a 3.5 star place but it deserves to be rounded up.  Why?  Because the servers are exceptionally nice and responsive.  The food is not amazing but is generally standard diner food, but the atmosphere is, well, let's just say - over the top.  The pictures on the wall are almost distracting, they are so large.    I ordered a breakfast chili combo thing.  It was basically eggs, potatoes, and chili.  Strange combo, I know, but I really enjoyed it.  A little on the oniony side but quite good.  The home fries are home-made so I would recommend them over the hashedbrowns which, I would assume, are from a bag.  They were actually really good.    In all, I would go back here.  It wasn't amazing but the price was right, the service was great, and the food was tasty.

This place has an amazing selection of fabrics.  Most of these fabrics are the stuff you see covering furniture at La-Z-Boy or Target and they have it here.  They have more upholstery fabric than anything else but you could make out with a smoking deal if you are looking for team-licensed fabric or for trim.  They have a ton of that stuff.  Their stock seems to change pretty quickly.  If you sew or just feel like re-doing your barstools, you have to check this place out. We are talking about $3 a yard for some expensive fabric people!

Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.    As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good.

This place is pretty awesome.  I had no idea it was down here but as I was driving back to downtown from Tempe I noticed the chili peppers hanging outside.  Since my mom was looking for a strand, i made a U-turn and went back.  It is full of locally grown produce and a ton of locally made breads, jams, and other things.  It is a totally awesome place and is actually 100x better than the Phx Public Market store.  This is everything that the market should be.  I wish it wasn't so far away but I will be back as soon as I get over there.

Do you ever find yourself saying that a Target is "backwards" because of the layout?  There are essentially three layouts to targets - 1) the electronics are all the way to the left when you walk in, 2) the electronics are all the way to the right when you walk in, and 3) the electronics are in the middle-back of the store.  Well this one is a #2 which is backwards to me.  Kind of weird.  They had a good selection of clearance clothes which was surprising.  A lot of the things they had were things I had never seen over at the SuperTarget @ Christown.  I guess that's what you get when you are in the suburbs of Awatukee.  Anyways, top notch Target but it is no SuperTarget.

For a suburban breakfast spot, I am always surprised to find that we get seated right away at Crackers & Co.  You can't get near Black Bear Diner at the same time of day but you can walk right in to Crackers & Co.  It is really a testament to how quickly they churn out food and turn over tables.    Every time I go I try something different.  While I've only been for breakfast, I am always satisfied with my order.  It comes quickly and tastes great.  While nothing compares to Matt's, this is as good as it gets for this kind of breakfast place.  I would take Crackers & Co over any of the competition any day.

Okay, so I might be partial to this place but it marries three of my favorite things in one place so I just have to love it.  The main building is a beautiful example of 1950s architecture.  The lobby is beautiful and the there is a great sense of history here.  Once you start looking around, you see all sorts of memorabilia from the old days when this was a spring training site.  Having baseball memorabilia is a sure way to get me interested, even if it is stupid Giants stuff.  The fact that they have a baseball bat-shaped pool is amazing too.  Finally, this place just finished a $8+million renovation into a world-class soccer training facility.  My Seattle Sounders opened the place up by holding their spring training there.  This made for an awesome experience.  While there aren't any bleachers or concession stands, there also aren't any fences or barriers keeping you away from the players.  This is the way spring training should be.  I am going back again this week and will keep going back as long as the Sounders do.

I'm not really sure what just happened to me.  I just ate a bunch of flash-frozen meat that was white, curled, and stiff.  I put it in a bowl and mashed it with a napkin, put some even less fresh looking veggies on it, and handed it to an angry mexican who proceeded to cook it on something that looked like the urinals in Sun Devil Stadium.  I didn't like preparing my own food for this price, I don't like that they KNOW the meat shrinks but won't give you a decent sized bowl to put enough in it - although...with as nasty as the meat tasted, why would you want any more of it?  I might go back here and just do noodles and sauce.  The noodles were the only thing that seemed safe to eat and the sauce (you make your own) was the only thing redeeming about this place.  I was definitely missing the Wendy's that used to be in this spot.

Game Depot has a lot of positive things going on.  The first is that their game room is off to the side.  What this means for non extreme gamers is that you no longer have to feel awkward when you walk in and 100 eyes all look at you for letting the light in and disrupting their game.  This makes the store much more comfortable for people like myself.    We went in just looking for board games.  While their selection isn't huge, they did have some of the hard to find games and had games that have just been released in Europe that no other store has.  That alone makes them awesome.  The customer service is great too!  All of the workers were helpful and nice which is a sure way to get me to come back.  Wish they weren't so far away but they are still a totally awesome place.

Buried under the wonderful Hotel San Carlos is the perpetually popular Seamus McCaffery Irish Pub. I'm not a big drinker (actually, I don't drink, but I used to) but I love going to bars. There is something about the ambiance of a good Irish bar that doesn't try to be more than that. McCaffery's has a pretty decent menu for a bar. Corned beef and cabbage and fish and chips are expected but uncommon in the downtown area which makes them welcome fare. The beer selection is excellent with tons of imports in bottles and on tap. The burgers aren't great but the tuna sandwich is killer. There is live music on the weekends usually and the crowd is pretty constant most nights.  The service is terrible but it's a bar, I'm not sure what you expected.  If you are looking to drown your sorrows or surround yourself with a blue collar crowd, this is the best place in town to do it. If you are looking to grab a bite to eat, the Silver Spoon next door is a safer bet for variety and service.

The thing I love about being Italian is finding good authentic Italian delis that will provide me with life's little pleasures. I love capicola. I love mozzarella. I love cannoli. The thing about Italian food is that, for the most part, it's not that hard to make at home. I mean, I can make the best lasagna in an hour. Eggplant parm is no prob. A good Italian sub, though, is not something I can really make at home. I don't have giant loaves of bread sitting around even though I may have some cold cuts. So when you can find a perfect Sicilian hero with all the olive oil and basil on it just the way it should be, you really learn to appreciate why there are Italian delis on every corner back East. With the exception of the New Jersey Deli (Granada-owned) up in NoPho, I've yet to find another Italian deli that is this good in Phoenix. I hear good things about a place out in Gilbert on Williams Field but I haven't been and this blog isn't about Gilbert.  Carlo is usually there and usually with a big smile on his face. Even though he is a Red Sox fan, I love the guy for giving me a place to sit and eat a great sub. Chicken, salami, mortadella, capocollo, provolone, sopressata, prosciutto, roasted peppers, mozzarella, basil.... all at your disposal when you get your meal.  They also have pasta dishes with the basics like penne, gnocci, and ravioli. These aren't the best unfortunately. The gnocci has been frozen which destroys a lot of the flavor. Also, the lack of a pesto sauce is disappointing because it would give them a bit more variety with their dishes.  All in all, this place is a welcome addition to downtown. They have cannoli but they aren't as good as Mike's from Carlo's hometown of Boston. Don't miss it when you're driving down Roosevelt. It is near the corner of 3rd Ave (one-way N) and is just west of Roosevelt Square. Parking is on the street as well as behind the deli and in the garage.

Now I know that most folks who live here have either never heard of this combination or thought of it as some racist stereotype but Lo Lo's serves up the best fried chicken in AZ along with a side of waffles and a cup of syrup like you've never tasted before. The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.  You'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated. You will not find this kind of food elsewhere in Phoenix.

This is really the perfect place for a college area.  Too bad it is wasted on Phoenix College.  The place is big, cluttered with cool stuff on the walls, and has a bar & a smoking patio.  The ordering process is fast and makes it easy.  It's like Fudruckers but edible.    I ordered the Hawaiian Burger.  While it wasn't as good as the one I used to get at Goofy Goose in Tacoma, it was still pretty good.  The patty was huge, hand-formed, and perfectly cooked.  The bun was tasty.  There was ample Swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce on the burger as well.  The only complaint was that it only had one pineapple which was a 1/4 the size of the burger.  I really only got the full "Hawaiian Burger" experience when I got into the middle where the pineapple was.  Oh well, it was still good.  The side order of fries was tasty enough and their onion rings looked good.    The condiment bar was a bit lacking.  I was hoping for lots of different sauces like honey mustard or horseradish but it was pretty much the basics.  The salad bar didn't look all that good to me but why are you getting a salad at a burger place?  In all, great burger, good prices, and exactly what I expected.  WAY better than Burger Studio.

Well it is a Mexican place that is close to downtown that actually has waiters so that is a big plus right there.  The chips and salsa that seem obligatory with Mexican places were pretty good.  I ordered a spinach and feta burrito or something.  I couldn't really see it because it was burried under a ton of this cream sauce stuff - not that I minded, that stuff was good!  My burrito thing was really tasty and I'd probably order it again.  Their menu was a bit overwhelming and I wish it had some pictures cuz I had no idea what most of it was.  In the end, it was good, and I'm sure I'd go back.

Oh god what a disaster.  The only thing that redeems this place was the cheap prices.  I've been to plenty of Chinese Buffets in my life and I drive by this one every day.  We finally had to go in and let me say - the quality of the decor matches the quality of food.    The wallpaper is peeling, the floors look unwashed, and the tables are like something out of your work's lunch room.    The waitress isn't bad, the cook seems to refresh the food often, and some of the dishes aren't disgusting.  Most are though.  Too bad.

I nominate this place for an OYE.  How awesomely Korean can you get?  Korean music videos playing on the projection screen, Korean karaoke going on in the back, and some friendly service to go along with great food.  We were starving late at night on a Saturday and didn't want greasy spoon or Scottsdale food.  I saw that this place was open and it was 1030 so we figured we'd give it a shot.  We walked in and the little hostess girl promptly sat us and gave us menus.  She was back quickly to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions.    The menu is pretty big.  They seem to do Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food here (including sushi) but I was just looking for a noodle bowl.  Sure enough, Yakisoba bowl with chicken was sitting there on the back so I went ahead and ordered it.    First we were given the customary bowl of soup with the little tofu cubes.  It was good.  Not any different than what you've had before, but it was good.  Then we got these four plates of different salads.  They were strange.  Kim chee and some cucumber one.  There was some other really spicy one and something else.  I don't really know what they were but they weren't bad.  When our entrees came out, I was quite pleased.  Heaping bowl of noodles with piles of veggies and chicken.  Just what you'd expect and just what I wanted.  SO GOOD though.  Way better than I expected for some random hole in the wall in the middle of the ghetto.    I will totally be back here.  I'd love for a bunch of yelpers to invade for Karaoke on the weekends and sing Korean music.  They were having a ton of fun!

So you know those movies where they start out in some diner and then someone gets shot outside, aliens attack, or semi-trucks go crazy and hold you prisoner?  This is that diner.  It is horribly decorated, has waitresses with just enough personality to excuse their slow pace, and has food that only a trucker and the locals could enjoy.  My omelet was actually a folded frittata.  The fact that I have to explain the difference is annoying enough.  I don't want the contents of my omelet cooked into the egg.  That's why I ordered an omelet.  If I wanted to be forced to eat egg with every bite, I would have ordered a damn frittata.  Typically cooks do this because they are lazy and can't properly flip the omelet.  It helps ensure that the egg gets cooked all the way through.  The problem is, this thing was not cooked all the way through, it was quite disturbingly runny on the inside.  To think, at least three chickens were aborted to make this terrible mess!  I have to give the owner some credit, he came to every table and made sure the food was good.  The problem was, we were both so nauseous after eating this, nothing he could do would have made our meal better.  I'd like to try it again and order something else...but I just don't think that will ever happen.

I know it is silly to give a Wendy's a 5-star review but really, this is the greatest Wendy's of all time.  The food is typical Wendy's food.  It doesn't taste any better or worse than it should and that is just fine.  The reason this place rocks is because of the service, particularly, the Drive-Thru.  Let me play this scenario out for you.  You pull up and order your meal. Girl on the speaker says $2.90 at the first window. As you get up to the first window, you hand her $3 in cash...she already has a dime in her hand and gives it to you while saying "second window." As you pull up to the second window, you barely have time to press the brake because the guy at the second window is there with your bag of food hanging out ready for you to grab it as you drive by.  I can literally go through this Wendy's drive-thu in under 30 seconds.  It is amazing.  They couldn't be faster if I called ahead.    Considering how little time many of us get for lunch, a place like this is really a blessing.  The manager who trains his staff to perform so well should be commended. I love this Wendy's!

Wow, Daren says this place has the best orange chicken and I don't know if I could find him to be MORE WRONG.  No offense to Daren, he's a good guy with good reviews but this chicken was terrible.  It looked and had the texture of calamari - NOT chicken.  The sauce they drown the things in was excellent but the texture of the chicken was disgusting.  I couldn't possibly ever go back here simply because of that.  I'll stick with China Chili's orange chicken, thank you.

My food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time. The breadsticks reminded me of Fazoli's.  Anyone remember that place?  Remember the breadsticks?  Ya, they were stale, dry, and overly absorbent of the saliva inside my mouth.  They were not, however, rock hard, so I consider the breadsticks a wash.   The salad was heavy on the onions, easy on the ANYTHING ELSE.  I've never seen an onion salad before but I would imagine that Olive Garden could make one without much extra effort.  I don't understand why they don't do dressing either.  Maybe they do and there was just too little on it, but the salad was dry.  So the salad was a fail.   For the soup, I went with the Chicken & Gnocchi.  By chicken they mean "chicken broth" and by gnocchi they mean "ball of flour dough".  This was more like wanton soup than anything else.  It didn't taste horrible, just cheap...so only a minor fail.   I'm still alive, so I did better than I expected.  I figured the worst thing that could happen would be if I got horribly sick and had to take paid time off for a week...that didn't happen either...so another fail.  The whole experience is what got me.  We show up to GhettroCentre with 6 people and there are at least 20 waiting around for tables.  That's fine, it is lunch time.  We got a table and our waitress was decent enough.  Group ordered some sort of appetizers (that I did not partake of).  They brought our drinks.  We ordered our meals.  They brought our salads and breadsticks.  Then they brought us one of the apps.  About 10 minutes later she comes by to check on us...and we tell her we still don't have the other app.  She disappears for a while and comes back and says "we ran out of chicken so it's going to be a while"... wait what?  You ran out...but you will...what?  Clone some more?  Sub something else?  What are you doing to make more chicken appear?  We decline the app since our meals are arriving any minute.  Food arrives, everything is normal, whatever.  I was only mildly distracted by the weird outdoor christmas light strings they have draped throughout the dining room.  I survived.  My question is, my soup/salad/breadstick combo was like $6.99.  Everyone else's meals come with salad and breadsticks, right?  So I could have just ordered the $5.34 soup (seriously, that is expensive soup) and noshed on salad and breadsticks without paying for them?  Right?  What is up with that?

One of the oldest Spring Training complexes in Arizona is also one of the best.  Situated just outside of Old Town Scottsdale, Scottsdale Stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over.  Getting to Scottsdale Stadium can be a bit of a pain.  It is a few miles from the freeway and almost requires that you deal with Scottsdale traffic.  If you take Earll to Civic Center and then merge on to Drinkwater, you should be able to find either street parking or library parking for free.  The dirt lots on the east side of the stadium should be avoided.  Also, the Trolley goes by the stadium so you can park anywhere along the line and catch it.  Once you try to walk into Scottsdale Stadium, you will notice the food bank collection going on at each gate.  This is not voluntary.  You will be required to drop off everything eatable or drinkable (except closed water bottles) before you can enter.  This, of course, should prepare you to empty your wallet once you are inside.  The concrete concourse obstructs the field which is a big hindrance but the area down the foul lines and the entire outfield berm has a clear view from the concourse.  That is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster.  There are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails.    Seating in Scottsdale is some of the best.  The berm seating has a huge slope and features large shade trees.  This makes for the best grass seating in the Cactus League.  The regular seats are a bit on the smaller side but almost all of them are close to the field and have good views.  The practice field is beyond the right field wall.  Usually, this means the visiting team takes BP on the main field making this a great place for autographs.  If you were to want a Giant to autograph something, they all come down the first base line and most will stop and sign.  Don't expect to have access to the practice field beyond standing behind a chain link fence.  This stadium has hosted so many teams over the years, it is too bad the terrible Giants play there now.  Ignoring that fact, Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a game, especially if you are in the East Valley.

So we went here for Game Night UYE and I was a little concerned that it was going to be a) too loud or b) too crowded.  We found a giant wooden table/bench thing and set up shop there.  The waiters/waitresses were all cool and very helpful.  Not too pushy and they were always very quick with the beer delivery.  Gotta say, they were awesome.  The beer selection is amazing.  Not in love with the mandarin orange thing but they had enough stouts to keep me happy throughout the night.  This place is really cool and reminds me of a lot of the places back in Olympia.  The only knock is the food.  It wasn't great.  It was better than your average bar food but, I think in this day and age of gastro-pubs and high end wine bars, you have to have quality food.  The "Beer Bites" were tasty but lacking in seasoning.  The chips and dip were pretty good but the chips were a bit stale.  I will go back, without a doubt.  Great place and we had a great time to match.

I'm going to be more forgiving of the service than my wife was.  This place has some awesome food and it comes out pretty quick too.  Yes, it took forever to get the waitress to come over but once she did, we had our food in about 5 minutes.  I really wish I knew what I was eating.  It was the "Chef's Favorite Combination" which was chicken, collard greens, and something called ayeb which was cheese of some sort.  The whole thing comes on some weird flat bread.  It was really good.  I would go back, without a doubt.

This is a pretty trash mini golf course and I have been to my fair share.  We went on a Saturday night in the middle of February...we are talking primo outdoor time in AZ...and they had one of their four courses closed.  Then, adding to the already frustrating congestion, they over-sell to groups.  Instead of sticking to their own posted rule of "no more than 4 to a group" they will allow families of 8, 10, 23 to group up and play together.  This, as you can imagine, causes some serious congestion on the links. So after waiting 10 minutes for the group ahead of us to finish the first hole, we decided to skip over them and just come back and finish that hold later.  Glad we did because we noticed a backup of 4 groups behind them as we neared the end. The holes are decent but pretty unimaginative.  There really isn't much integration into the natural landscape which takes a bit of the fun out of it, plus there were multiple holes with the same "trick" on one course.  That makes for a pretty boring go 'round.  There are no pars listed for each hole which takes some of the fun out of the game. This is a pretty low-rent golf course and they charge about $7 per player.  I guess that is a decent price but there are better places to play in the Valley.

This place kicks ass.  I'm a huge fan of non-hippie vegetarian food.  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time.  With the advances we made in soy products, it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredients.  So I ordered the buffalo chicken po-boy.  SOOO good.  Plus it came with fries.  Can't hate fries.  It's really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant.  I literally can't wait to go back.  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go.  It's so good.

So you have to love breakfast.  It is a great meal that really begs for creativity.  There are so few places that have creative breakfasts (Palette was one) but most places just do the standard fare.  That would be Kiss the Cook.  Nothing special about it.  No magic applewood smoked turkey sausage with kumquat glaze, no french waffels - just your standard stuff.  They do it well though.  Think of it as basic breakfast without the grease.    The waitresses are great and have a ton of personality.  They really make this place a Four Star establishment.  The mini muffins that come before your meal is always a saving grace and they are the perfect size to tide you over till your food arrives.  That being said, your food won't take too long and you will get plenty of it.    I tried the french toast with a side of ham.  The toast was decent; with a hint of cinnamon.  Nice but not amazing.  The ham was a really good size and it tasted damn good.  The fresh squeezed OJ wasn't as good as Matt's but it was better than something from a carton.   I'd go back here if I was out in Glendale for breakfast.  A great place with a ton of character.  The food isn't overwhelming but it is good enough for breakfast.

This is a pretty cool place is you need some weird outdoor westerny crap for your house.  They have like 2000 metal sculptures and surely one of them will suit your fancy.  Since I don't have a yard, I didn't really find anything for me...but you might.  If you have friends in town who want something stupid and southwestern, skip Gilbert Ortega and just take them here.

This may be a first so I want everyone to brace themselves.  Bianco's is OVERRATED!  There, I said it. I'm sure I lost some readers along the way but I can handle that.  The most unfortunate thing about this whole Bianco love affair is that the concept, building, and product are all excellent. The pizza is very good. The building is an amazing old brick structure that reminds me of my loft. The area is as beautiful as you will find in downtown Phoenix, surrounded by lush greenery, a garden, and tons of history. Waiting isn't even that bad when you consider Bar Bianco is full of the same character and spirit that the pizzeria is. I hate to hate Pizzeria Bianco...but I do.  We went a couple years back. We were going to a Dbacks game of particular importance (Dirty Byrnes t-shirt night) and decided we'd put our names in at Bianco's. The wait is usually 2 hours so that gave us plenty of time to watch most of the game. Around the 5th we decided it had been enough time so we headed over. The hostess told us it would be another hour or so.  Hmph....  Of course we had no idea that the Oprah Show was doing a special on the restaurant this night so Gail is running around inside making a hell of a backup for the kitchen. Just our luck.  Almost two more hours later we were finally seated. Gail left a few minutes after that. We ordered the Biancoverde pizza (which was not green) and well, it tasted like every other wood-fired pizza I have ever had. The crust was charred on the bottom but the pizza was perfect. I'm not sure if brick ovens are outlawed in downtown, but I don't get the trend. In any event, as we were about to finish, Chris Bianco came over and apologized for making us wait so long, he paid for our dinner and bought us dessert. Awful nice for a guy who knows that every housewife within 3000 miles is going to be flying to Phoenix to wait four hours for his pizza.  Like I said, I didn't hate it. But it wasn't worth 4 hours. It wasn't worth the original 2 but I had to see what the hype was about. I wouldn't wait longer than 40 minutes for Bianco's because, that is the longest you will ever wait at Cibo. You will have a similar experience for a similar price but you won't be starved when you finally sit down to eat.

Well there are a ton of reviews and I can't really say I disagree with many of them.  This place is loud, the parking is nightmarish, and it really doesn't have much of a vibe.  You sort of feel like you're sitting in some cheesy strip mall restaurant (which you sort of are).  All that being said, I ordered the special of the night - an 8oz Fillet Mignon (with potatoes, chorizo, and all sorts of goodness) & 10oz Lobster tail.  The dish was absolutely divine and one of the best things I've ever eaten in CenPho.  My only gripe was the guacamole.  What a big disappointment.  All the hype- the freshness, the tableside, the blah blah blah, the $15 price tag.  You'd think this was ambrosiamole.  Not good at all.  One freakin avacado!?  That's all I get?  And a bunch of pom seeds?!?  No thank you.  I'll take Ticoz guacammus any day over that mess.

Chino is one of those places that I grew up eating.  It seems like it has been here forever and we used to order takeout from them when I was just a little kid.  There was a long period in between that I grew up, found other places to eat, moved away, and just plain forgot about this place.  Now, working right down the street, I've always intended to go back.  I finally did and boy did I miss this place.  Of course the ordering style is a bit strange and is the only thing that knocks one star from my review.  I don't understand why I can't just freakin order.  Why do I need to pretend I am ordering sushi when I just want a standard mexican bowl of rice and meat?  I ordered something...red pork or something like that.  I'm not really sure.  I just looked at the menu and picked a number.  It was great.  Spicy, meaty, excellent.  The prices were reasonable and the food was great.  No complaints there.  Sure the place is in a ghetto strip mall (although PoppaMaize next door is killer!) and looks dirty as a barn, but the food is great and you can always do take-out.  Chino is the best fusion in town...I must say.  They are all about the spicy and that is what I like.

Say it with me "Cheee-bow", now you've got it. Chris Bianco had better stay on his side of Central because Cibo is bringing some serious wood-fired heat with their two-person pizza kitchen stashed away in a restored home on the corner of Fillmore and 5th Ave. Lunch and dinner only here (for breakfast pizza, check out Pie-sano's) in a unique pizzeria that makes me feel like I'm eating at home. The pizza is cooked up in a wood burning oven (like Bianco's) so expect that same taste. They are smaller, typically for two people, and can range from a classic white pizza to the strangest concoction your mind can dream up. The seating is limited and there is a crowd perpetually from 11am to 10pm. Don't even try on First Fridays or Suns game nights. Cibo is out of the way but easy to access from 7th Ave. Parking is limited and only getting worse. Be careful crossing the street, the corner is dark and I drive fast.

Fez is BY FAR my favorite place to take people who are new to the midtown area.  Not only does it stand out as something different than you'll find anywhere else in Phoenix but it also provides top culinary options that will satisfy most palates.  There are a few gripes about Fez though.  The first is that parking can be a headache when they are busy.  Kinkos takes up most of the good spots.  The second is that Fez is really a gay bar masquerading as a restaurant.  Not that having gay clientele is a problem but the servers will only pay attention to you if you are not a co-ed group.  I get terrible service when I take my wife or we go with other couples.  When I bring a guy friend, we are always immediately tended to.    The drink selection is good but they don't have a blender so don't expect anything slushy.  The drink menu consists of martinis of all different flavor combination and are quite popular.  The pomegranate one seems to be a favorite of my friends.  The food selection is a bit overwhelming upon reading the menu.  Arugula, pears, saffron; all sorts of strange additions to traditional American plates.  The wife always orders the lamb chops with pesto.  She swears by them.  I always get the Fez Burger.  It is, by far, the best burger in Phoenix.  The bbq sauce's tangy-ness mixed with the sweet pear makes the burger unbelievable.  Unfortunately, the salad that accompanies the Fez Burger is one of the worst combination I have ever been forced to eat.    Fez is a lounge type environment.  Some of the tables are couches, some are four tops, and some are high tops.  There is usually some techno music playing but it is not too loud to disturb your conversation.  They have a patio that, assuming they still allow this, will let you bring your dogs out with you.  I am so glad that they survived the light rail construction and cannot wait to go back.

Simply the best place in Arizona for breakfast!  Matt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.  The obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.    If you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.    The food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.  The workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.    Do not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go.

What an awesome place.  I am sorry that it took me so long to get here.  It is totally a 5-star place in a 2-star location.  If I could pick up the whole building and move it to that triangle lot on Central & Camelback, I would.  Having a pub THIS good SO far from the LRT is hard for me to handle.    Inside, it is pretty dank.  There are tvs and crap on the walls but the ceilings are low in some places and the wood is all dark.  Pretty much everything you want in a pub.    We happened to go during the US Open Cup Final match with my Sounders playing and, without any debate, they were happy to put it on the tv.  To tell you the number of times I have fought with the waitresses at the Turf in order to get a soccer match on would mean a review twice as long as this.  In any event, soccer on the tele, big points!  I ordered the fish & chips because, well, I heard they were amazing.  Amazing? Probably not.  The fries were pretty plain but the fish was good.  The tartar sauce was pretty damn good too.  Will have to try something else next time.  The beer selection is great and they actually have a cider on tap which is unheard of here in Phx.  Our waitress was this older woman with a thick Irish accent who I would swear owns the place.  She was so sweet and totally made us love the place even more.    A great place, without a doubt.  Can't wait to go back.

I'm pretty sure I would have to give Ticoz 3.5 stars based on this last visit but since I'm such a fan of Swtich and Fez, I'll bump it up to 4 stars.  We finally completed the trinity by getting to Ticoz over the labor day weekend.  They were having some amazing deals on sangria and we wanted to meet up with friends after First Fridays so it seemed like the perfect chance.  The decor is amazing.  Love the lounge area around the bar, especially the couches.  We sat over in the bar and met up with our friends.  I don't know how long they had been there but they didn't have their drinks yet when we arrived and the waiter didn't exactly rush to come over and take our order.  When he did, he was gone for what seemed like forever getting our drinks.  They came out eventually and they were great.  Then we all ordered some food and I personally got the guacummus or whatever it is.  I'd been dying to try it and totally glad I did.  It was an amazing combo and the pita bread and black corn tortilla chips really made it a great late night meal.  We ordered some more drinks and enjoyed our food.  Everyone seemed to be really happy with their food.  So later in the night, a large section of our group decided they were going to head back to Scottsdale so they asked for their bill.  It took our waiter a while to get their bills and then to pick them back up.  Our friends were a bit annoyed because they really wanted to get out of there before it got too late.  Once they had left, the waiter barely paid any attention to us.    The funny thing about it is that all of our friends who left were gay and those of us who stayed, are straight.  This fits in with my theory from Fez where only gays get attentive service.    We practically had to yell at our waiter to get any more drinks by that point in the evening and then, without asking if we were done, he just brought us our bills.  I guess he was ready for us to leave.  In all, it was sort of a mixed experience.  As with Switch and Fez, the service can be terrible on a busy night but great on a normal night.  I'll update my review after going back for dinner some time.  I will be going back though - without a doubt.

This isn't my favorite Ikea but it is pretty decent.  The giant parking lot is obscene and makes me mad almost every time I drive by it.  What a waste of space and one more heat island in the valley.    Inside they start you off by going upstairs and making you walk through all of the design areas with the little rooms.  Decent layout, it flows well, and looks like all of the others.  The cafe is in the middle right by the escalators.    The really annoying thing about this Ikea is that they have so many self-serve stations but they are always closed.  I just don't get how it is bad for them to have electronic checkout stations open.  The last time we were there, the lanes were 3 or 4 people deep and there were only 4 lanes open; three of which were self-serve.  It is frustrating when there is someone at a checkout who can't manage to do it themselves and the attendant just watches them instead of helping.  The selection at this one isn't as good as the San Diego store.  If you fancy a drive, check that one out.

I'm really surprised at the negative reviews of the Clarendon from people on here.  I've never had anything but get bar service either on the roof or in the lounge.  While I've never stayed at the Clarendon, we go every so often to hang out with friends for a few drinks.  To begin, the rooftop is amazing.  It is the perfect place for those cool winter nights.  They even have heaters if you get too cold.  The bar upstairs isn't fully stocked but they have enough to save you a trip downstairs.  Finally, the view is really impressive.  It is great to escape the craziness every so often.  The pool area is one of the best in Phx.  I guess they charge now but I hear you get a towel and sunblock so I don't suppose that's a bad thing.  The pool is gorgeous, especially at night, and there are always pretty people around it.    The interior of the hotel is classic.  Strange art pieces and Rolling Stone-inspired urinals really bring out the quirks of this place.  The lounge and bar are nicely appointed and really make for a great place to hang out when the temperatures are inhospitable.  Also, don't forget the amazing Gallo Blanco restaurant inside.    I simply love the Clarendon and am totally excited for the temps to cool off so I can hit the rooftop again!

Whoa, totally don't understand the love for this place.  We met with a group over here and boy was I disappointed.  To begin, why doesn't Glendale have meters?  Why do I have to go out and move my car every two hours?  That makes it really hard to drink and sober up without drinking and driving if I have to go out and move my car to a new spot every 120 minutes.  That's not Haus Murphy's fault but it is something that will deter me from going out there to drink.    So we get in there and our waitress is awesome enough.  She is friendly, responsive, and helpful.  In fact, I want that waitress to come with me to some other restaurants (looking at you Fez) and show them how it should be done.  In any event, she was great and the only saving grace of this establishment.  Now on to the bad food.  I'm not German, never been to Germany, and my German culinary knowledge is limited to Milwaukee Brewers' baseball games.  That being said, food either tastes good or it doesn't.  I had the Wullwurst sausages.  They came out looking like fried Twinkies and tasted about the same.  No spice, no real flavor, and surrounded by a tough skin.  They were flanked by some purple cabbage that was unedible and some German potato salad that was some of the nastiest mush I've ever had.    Apparently unsatisfied by this gluttonous torture that I had already endured, I ordered the German chocolate cake.  Now, I know this isn't an actual German food but it looked good and I thought they might go all out with it.  Nope, again - not good.  Flavorless.  I was basic chocolate cake with a thin layer of coconut on top and some Betty Crocker frosting on the outside.    Sorry but this place was just not good and I will not be back.

Went for happy hour on a Tuesday evening.  Showed up around 4 and the place was dead.  By 630, the business crowed from downtown had made it and the place was hoppin'.  Definitely a business crowd place but still laid back.  The prices of regular-hour food is way too high for me but the happy hour prices were reasonable.  $5 Tuesday margaritas were heavy-handed and the $3.50 wells were solid.  The selection of beers on Happy Hour are limited to mostly american crap and the imported/drinkable beers were outrageously priced ($9.75 for a Young's Chocolate Stout!?).    We grazed off a selection of Happy Hour appetizers including bacon-wrapped scallops, potato skins with pulled pork, Shrimp Cocktail, and Beef Sliders.    The scallops were great - a good combination of crispy bacon with the soft scallop.  They came with a sauce (something with ginger in it) that really brought the flavors together.  The potato skins with pulled pork were amazing - cheese, chives, pork, and potato was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  The shrimp cocktail was decent but for $5, it only came with 5 shrimp.  They were decently sized though.  The sliders were more like two small steaks with onions and a bun.  I wasn't really expecting that toughness when i bit into it and it sort of ruined the experience.  Be warned.  4 people, 8 drinks, 6 appetizers, tax, tip = $100.  Not bad for happy hour.  Would definitely return after pay-day.

This is one of those 3.5 star restaurants but since it is close to downtown and actually has a parkinglot in the back, I'll bump it up to four.  The food was pretty good.  I had ordered the biscuits and gravy.  Mind you, they weren't as good as Breakfast Joynt's but it was pretty solid.  The biscuits tasted fresh and were not hard.  The gravy could have used more pepper and sausage in it but I resolved the pepper situation and the giant sausage patties that came with my meal helped solve the other situation.  I came out of here full and happy.  The price is right and the place is full of a great mix of different people.  Really a good place to people watch.  I will most likely come back.

I don't think there is anything in this store that I would ever buy for myself but whenever I need a gift for a woman, I know where to go.  They have jewelry, clothes, and accessories.  They also have baby stuff and pet stuff but this place is here for girls aged 15-40.  If they wear it on Gossip Girl, you'll probably find something like it here.  Their pricing operates sort of like the airport.  Some things seem completely reasonable and others make you spit your coffee out.  I really don't get it...but they do have a sale section that is usually full of great bargains.  You are always assured of finding something cool and trendy here so I would highly recommend it.

We love Wag N Wash and so does our monstah, Rally! He's always so excited to go in, even if his feet skid around on the tile like it was an ice rink.  The prices are average or slightly below similar smaller pet food shops and the people who work there are always helpful.  Their selection of toys is great.  The food tends to be on the hippier side of things so don't go in there looking for crappy PetCo stuff.    As far as the washing area goes, I love the concept and it always works well.  A raised steel tub with all of the accessories you could need.  Saves your back and keeps your semi-dry.  When he's not trying to eat the water from the spray, Rally really enjoys the tub area.  They also have a drying station but it is a bit loud for our pup.    Sign up for the frequent-buyer program.  We have easily saved $100 thanks to the coupons they seem to send us every month!

This is my favorite Einstiens!  Not only is there hardly ever a line but the people who work there are great.  They always load up my bagel with cream cheese or my power bagel with pb&j.  They are awesome.  They have just as good of a selection as the one on McDowell PLUS they serve beer.  You really can't beat that.  It also makes for a great place to people watch.  Big 5-star review for the best Einsteins in town.

This is probably my favorite gallery store in the valley.  There isn't a whole ton that I would buy here but everything they have is very reasonably priced.  As everyone else has said, there are a lot of naked sculptures and paintings and whatnot.  I'm okay with that.  The other things that they sell are just amazing though.  We've bought a few things here but the giant Phoenix sculpture made from tools will always be the item that I want.  Just wish I could afford it.

I've been going to Peoria since they opened.  Even when I lived in Seattle, I would fly back to Phoenix to watch the M's play ball in Peoria.  This is really one of the best parks in the Cactus League.  Getting there is a breeze.  Not only does the 101 freeway run right by it, but it is just south of Bell Rd.  It is easiest to reach the complex by coming North on 83rd from Peoria (don't do Thunderbird) or Cactus and then parking at the Buca Di Beppo's across the street.  You can park there for free and, a short walk later, you will be at the front gate.  Once you are in, the exterior concourse is filled with food options that only a Carny could love.  Fried Oreos, Twinkies, and something called Taco in a Bag (crushed Fritos or Doritos topped with beans, salsa, lettuce, and cheese).  There are gyros, bbq, sausages, Dodger Dogs-corndogified, and many of the traditional ballpark food options.  Prices range depending on where you are so look around.  The grass is some of the best in the Cactus League and allows fans to watch the pitchers warm up in the bullpen as well as catch the game.  Most of the seats are on the smaller size and have not been updated since 1993.  The exception is the upperdeck where, in 2008, new padded seats were installed.  Those seats also feature a waiter who will get you anything you need from the main concession stand.  There is a concession stand up stairs for those seats and there is also a bathroom.  Very nice amenities for tickets that usually hover around $26.  For shaded seats, sit in either the 200 or 300 sections.  The third base line gets more shade than the first.  Player access is somewhat spotty.  Both teams use the practice fields to warm up and do their drills so you won't find them on the field until about an hour before the game starts.  Once they start coming out, you can camp out down the right field line to get all of the players as they come on the field.  If you want a better spot, cross the bridge into the right field berm and go down the hill.  There is a fence that all of the players walk by and most will sign there as opposed to once they get on the field.  The best part of Peoria Sports Complex is that they tend to host more night games than the other stadiums.  There are usually 3 or 4 every year which is great for locals who can't take a month off of work.    My only gripe is with the employees.  The place is staffed with volunteer retired Sun City people.  They are grumpy and always on a power trip.  They always want to check your ticket (even when both hands are full of food) and act like they are the last line of defense between the terrorists and the field.  While they can put a blemish on the experience, overall, it is always great to catch a game at Peoria.

This place kicks serious ass.  We went on a Friday night and, while I expected it to be busy, I sure didn't expect this.  There were TONS of people here.  It seemed like everyone knew everyone else and that everyone was just there to have a good time.  There are easily a dozen tvs on the wall in the dining area.  They have tons of beers, arcade games, and pool tables.  There is a nice patio with tvs and the servers are great.  As for the food, I only tried the raspberry-chipotle wings and the beer fries but both were great.  They don't charge you for ranch and don't screw you by making you order a minimum number of wings in a certain flavor.  You could get a dozen wings in all the flavors if you wanted - now that's how it should be done.  I don't usually go to this part of town but this will definitely become my new hangout when I'm in the Tuk.

Probably the worst Spring Training site in the Valley.  Time has not treated this place well and it really begins to fail as you compare it to the competition.  It is too bad considering the great location.  Getting to Phoenix Muni is pretty simple.  You can take the 202 and get off at Van Buren or you could probably take the light rail if you didn't mind a bit of a walk.  There is a ton of parking around Muni and it is hard to find any that is free.  It does exist, however, along the North-East side of the stadium in the dirt areas.  If you park in the lots, be prepared to walk a mile over the hideous pedestrian bridge.  Once you get into the stadium, you are bombarded with concrete.  There is literally concrete everywhere you look in this stadium.  The only things not made of concrete are the field and the wooden signs that make up the outfield wall.  All of this concrete, combined with the numerous metal seats, make this one of the hottest ballparks in the Cactus League.    Access to the players is not that great either.  While you can catch most of them coming in from right field, their practice field is difficult to get to and secluded.  Pitchers do warm up down the lines which gives you a seat just a few feet from a fastball.    In all, Muni is a failure.  The City of Phoenix must improve the area greatly for it to continue to host Spring Training.  It would be nice to see them convert the parking lot into a multi-story entertainment development but, right now, the Zoo is the only other thing over there.  There are no grass seats which is really part of the fun of spring training.  There is little shade.  There are few reasons to go to the stadium and that is unfortunate because the A's are such a good team to watch.

Mmmmmm shrimp tacos.  I used to live in the Bajio in Mesa.  I feel like I was there once a week.  My favorite Mexican food.  The shrimp tacos have a honey sauce that is to die for and the tortillas are cooked on the griddle just long enough to keep them from getting soggy.  Really good stuff.  Plus the queso is wicked good.  This location is a bit pricier than the old Mesa one was but at least it is still open.  They also serve beer out here because it's not Mesa.  Much love for the No.Pho Bajio...just wish it wasn't so far.

I was going to give this place a good review.  They should teach a seminar on getting through a lunch rush line - they are THAT good at it.  This place always gets slammed at lunch during the week and I can still get in and out in under 5 minutes.  I say I WAS going to give it a good review because, as soon as I clicked on it, I remembered the experience I had a year ago.  I was buying some sandwiches to take to a ballgame and the little guy behind the counter decided he would argue with me about what I wanted on my sub.  He starts mouthing stuff under his breath and I call him out on it.  The manager intervened but did nothing to punish the employee or to compensate me.  Never saw that little guy after that but I hope he is gone.

Whoa.  Rarely...RARELY!...is there a breakfast place that I give 5 stars.  It has to be as good as Matt's to get five stars from me.  That is not an easy thing to do but the AZ Bread Co has been successful.  This place is a jewel and should be in every major city.  To start, the setup is perfect.  A long counter to order your food at with pastries visible from the entrance and a large menu.  They take your order and you go sit and wait for it.  No stupid cluster of people in the entrance like at Scramble, so waiting for tables like at Matt's - you order and you wait for your food.  If the place is packed, you can sit outside.  No room outside, get it to go.  You can eat the stuff in your damn car if you like.  They have a soda fountain with Coke and if that doesn't deserve an extra star, I don't know what does. But all of that stuff becomes inconsequential when you start talking food.  The pecan french toast is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Their chalah bread is killer and makes the perfect french toast.  The pecan topping is so rich but oh so good.  I've also had the strawberry pancakes.  They are not covered in a strawberry sauce like most places do it.  Just pancakes, fresh cut strawberries, and some fresh whipped cream.  Yum.  The pancakes are perfect as well. There isn't anything I can find to complain about this place other than - it is far away.  Maybe one day they will open one downtown.  Until then, I don't mind driving 15 minutes to get there.

This Pick Up Stix is one of the worst for quality.  I can order the same dish and, somehow, over the span of a week, it can be completely different.  Sometimes the food will have onions, sometimes it won't.  Some days the chicken will look fried, some days it will look defrosted.  Whatever, you get what you pay for, but this is my least favorite of a usually reliable chain.

God this place is so far from downtown!  It is totally worth the drive though.  The Philly Cheese Steak pizza was an amazing concoction that only someone who smokes a ton of weed could ever come up with.  The order was easy and was ready when I got there so no complaints from any point.  Would go back in a heartbeat but damn - build one downtown!

Well after running around town looking for indie local game stores, we happened upon Imperial Games.  It's a little hard to miss but it is right across the street from ASU West.  Walking in, it could be a bit intimidating (especially if you come on a Thursday night).  There are tables set up in the middle of the store for gamers to use.  All of the games line the outside of the store and stay out of the way.  We went in looking for a couple of different games that we had heard about but weren't able to find elsewhere.  We asked the owner about each and he was quick to show us where they were.  He had opinions about each which he was happy to share, and he explained the basic principles of each game.  One of the games that he didn't have, he quickly researched online and told us that he would have it in the next week.  Amazing customer service.  The prices are all fair...in line with Amazon or another online retailer.  We may end up frequenting Imperial more often just to get the owner's suggestions.  Great store, especially if you want something more involved than what they sell at Target or Toys R Us.

I cannot echo Bri's comments enough.  It is not just a one time thing with this place.  It is always bad service.  Too few workers defined to too many tasks.  Put one person behind the register and have that be their only job.  Put one person in the back pulling stock.  Then, put everyone else on the floor helping customers.  I should not have to stand for 30 minutes and wait to have no one talk to me.  Terrible.  I literally wanted to ransack the place as I left.  I will never be back.  Ever.  Hinkleys on Central has my business now.

Oh boy this is a ghetto Target.  Not only are the people in it really sketchy but the store is trashed.  It literally looked like someone walked through and knocked everything off the shelves in one aisle.  The workers just ignored customers and pushed carts into people.  It was a bit of a disaster.  I did find what I was looking for, so I guess that's all that matters.

I'm not really sure why people don't like this place but I love it.  I am so happy they put one downtown finally.    Their sauce is a very sweet marinara.  If you don't like sweet, I can understand why you wouldn't like the pizza.  You can get about 4 different kinds of mushrooms on your pizza as well.  The topper is that you can get ricotta cheese on any pizza or calzone.  I personally always get a calzone with ricotta, mozzarella, black olives, portabella mushrooms, and italian sausage.  It is the most wonderful calzone ever.  The wife usually gets a pasta or a peperoni pizza.  She loves both.  The Thomas location also has an ice cream shop attached to it which is nice.  Usually the staff is knowledgeable and the cooks are consistent.  The Thomas location is also usually full of doctors or nurses which always makes for interesting conversation.

This is my primary blockbuster even though there is one closer to our house.  The reason we always go to this one is the awesome service we get.  The selection is pretty standard and they usually have at least one movie we want to watch in stock, so that is always good.  They do tend to have an odd number of gay movies...not sure if that is a plus or a minus but if you like soft-core gay porn, I suppose this is the place to go.    In any event, the people who work here are awesome.  They always get us in and out in like 30 seconds which is great.  We never have a problem turning in our Blockbuster mail-in movie for a movie in the store.  They are just really nice and efficient.  Far more than I can say about some of the other Blockbusters around Phx.

This place is totally worth the light rail ride out to Mesa.  It looks a little skeevy inside but damn if the food ain't good.  This is probably the best hole in the wall chinese I've had since I left NYC.    The orange chicken was killer.  That's really all I ever order when I go to a chinese place.  It helps me compare them.  It still wasn't as good as China Chili's but, for the price, it was amazing.  Speaking of price, the stuff here is like in the $3-$5 range.  It's like 1989 all over again.    My only complaint is really just the location.  It's an absolute dump inside.  Nothing is clean and I'd be surprised if this place passes health inspection.  Other than that - it's wicked good.

I feel like such a failure for not making it here sooner.  What kind of CenPhoenician am I for being like the 83rd review?  Sad.  So I FINALLY got to go for lunch.  Decided to try the "business lunch" a trio that costs $18 and says that you will be out in 30 minutes.  I wasn't in any hurry so I didn't time it, but the food was quite prompt.  The first course was an asparagus salad.  It was about 5 stalks of asparagus topped with pine nuts, cheese, and some drizzle of sauce.  It was amazing.  I normally hate pine nuts but these added a great saltiness to the meal.  This alone was totally worth the trip.  The second course was a skirt steak with white bean hummus and spinach.  The steak was really good - perfectly cooked.  The spinach could have used a bit of sea salt to bring out more of the flavor and break up the simple taste.  The white bean hummus was freaking amazing.  Never thought anything that sounded so nasty could be so good.  Way impressed!  The final course was a bag of cookies.  An awesome lunch dessert.  There were two chocolate chip, three sugar, and 1 strange almond sandie type cookie.  Did not enjoy the last one but the others were great.  Wish I could go back more often but this place ain't cheap.  Still love it though!

For my 100th review, I wanted it to be special so I decided to pick a place where I spend at least one morning of just about every weekend: The AMC 24 at AZ Center.    There isn't much else I can say that everyone else hasn't already said.  What other theater can you show up to 5 minutes before the movie and still get the middle seat with the footrest bar?  They have $5 movies before noon every day (including new releases) which is a bargain that can't be beat.  You get free refills on soda too.  They always have the newest movies and usually have at least one strange indie movie.    Along with all of the great stuff about the theater, you can go get $2 mimosas at 1130 before the show or a $5 footlong at Subway and bring it in for your flick.  Plus, it's only a couple blocks from the light rail stop so there is really no excuse for not going to the best AMC in the valley!

I hate to review this place like a normal pet store when they are really just a low-budget dog groomer but if you are going to sell food, toys, and clothes too, you should really do it right.    Oh Smelly Dog.  For years I have driven by you and thought "Hmph, I wonder what that place is like" as I head over to my favorite dog wash down the street (Wag N Wash) or to my favorite dog accessory store up Camelback (Oliver & Annie).  Since O&A closed and the owner told us he was sending his supplies over to Smelly Dog, we figured we HAD to try it.  We walk in and the place is a disaster.  Dog baths just out in the middle of the store with little yippie dogs all tied up near the door.  The floor was wet with pools of water which made it very slippery and dangerous.  The food selection is slim...like you have two choices.  I like that one of them is local but they could stand to carry a few others.  Their toy selection is okay but they could stand to carry WestPaw too.  They dog-clothing is pretty much limited to small dog stuff which is also too bad.  The one girl who worked there was pretty enthusiastic and helpful but the checkout girl completely pissed me off when she allowed a wash customer to cut in front of me to pay after I had stood there for 5 minutes.  This place has too many shortcomings to replace the wonderful Wag N Wash.  I'll be going to Noble Beast for accessories now.  Sorry...Smelly Dog is just too chaotic for me.

I really loved going to HAUS when it was in Biltmore but now that it is in the Camelback/Central plaza, it is way more convenient for me to go and look at stuff that I can't afford.    I love their baby section.  If we ever decided to have a kid, we would totally register for everything they have here.  Just an amazing selection of stuff.  Their kitchen items are all really cool but so pricey.  $40 for a single ice cream dish?  Wow!  Not today.  This place is a really good place to find gifts for people.  Not everything is expensive but most of the furniture is and it is too bad because I really want all of it.

I gotta say, I really didn't think I would like this place but it was wicked awesome in just about every way.  Love the open design and the simple decor.  Love the cold counter with all the grab-&-go stuff to make life easy.  Really love the bar where you can sit and watch the guy make the food.  All big pluses.  I ordered an egg salad sandwich which was a strange order for me.  I don't ever order egg salad but, oh well, I did and it was damn good.  It came with a side of pickles and was neatly plated.  Impressed with the presentation and the quality.  All very good.  Will have to try something else next time and, hopefully, some sweets too.

I don't get this place.  It is full of things that are completely foreign to me.  They are all cute and, for some reason, I usually want them.  I don't get it.  The people who work there are cool and they sell Ugly Dolls so they get my vote.

We make a point of going to cupcake places when we are on vacation.  We always get one red velvet and one of their "unique" cupcakes.  We use the red velvet as a control and the other to gauge creativity.  We finally decided to try this experiment on our hometown cupcakery.   The place was decorated nice enough but it was unorganized.  Some people were standing in line at the register to order, some just went  and grabbed someone and ordered, some just stood - bewildered.  That is not necessarily the fault of the shop, but a sign would help.   Our red velvet was the worst we've ever had.  Not only was the taste bitter but the top of the cupcake came off!  That's a big no-no.  This is unacceptable for a grocery store cupcake and really, a huge negative when it comes to a $4 cupcake.   The peanut butter chip cupcake was also uninspiring.  The cake was not moist and the frosting was not as creamy as it should be.  I think the people of Phoenix deserve better and have not experienced what all is out there.  Hopefully something decent comes along in the near future.

I really wanted to like Switch.  Fez is my favorite place in Midtown so I had high hopes for Switch.  The place looks great inside.  Blue and brown make for a wonderful color combination.  The seating is nice and is really inviting for large groups.  The food, for the most part, is quite good.  Tasty items like the mac & cheese stand out on the menu but provide a traditional contrast to the gallettes - all of which are excellent.  UPDATE: So after a very long hiatus from Switch, we decided to give it another shot.  It has been almost a year since back to back bad service experiences soured me on Switch and I had been assured that the situation had been fixed.    While it wasn't crowded, there was a decent number of people on an early First Fridays night.  Our waitress was quick and very helpful.  The bar was a bit slow churning out sangrias and drunken Italian Sodas but the drinks were good once they arrived.    The food, as always, was quite good.  The menu has changed a great deal since we were there last.  Loving everything about the burgers at FEZ, I had to try the Cowboy Burger at Switch and boy was it good.  I'm a bit annoyed at paying almost $2.00 extra for fries that were not sweet potato or covered in cinnamon & sugar.  The burger was cooked to order and was literally covered in bacon.  Quite good.  Switch has definitely changed since the last time I was there and that is great to see.  It would be nice if the dining room was better lit (it seems dark when combined with the dark furniture) and it would be very nice if I didn't have to walk a cancer-death-march to get inside from the parking lot.  I guess I could walk around to the front but I understand people want to smoke for whatever reason.

Just want to add that I've gone there for breakfast the past two weekends and everything has been excellent.  The pecan pancakes are the perfect size and are wicked tasty as is the breakfast sandwich.  The service is 1000% better in the morning than the evening and there isn't really a wait which is nice compared to Matts, Ihop, Over Easy, etc...

The food here is really only 3 stars.  It's okay but not nearly as good as I expected from such a hyped place.  I swear NoPho people act like this is the greatest addition since Arrowhead.  I was expecting a Matt's-like meal and I got some of the lamest "texas french toast" I've ever seen.  It wasn't bad tasting by any means but I've had better french toast sticks from Burger King.  What makes it a 4-star experience is the service.  Not only do they run through tables at a breakneck pace but they also have attentive and helpful servers who can carry 12 plates on each arm.  These octopus servers at least gave me something to watch after I finished my child-sized french toast.    I might go back and try something more greasy-spoon but for now, I'd rather just go to the Black Bear Diner down the road.

You know Super Target is the greatest invention ever.  Not only do I love target shopping, but now you give me a reason to go once a week.  Thank you Target.  This place is always clean and well lit.  There are never annoying intercom interruptions like at WalMart and the people who work there are always helpful.  The food selection is pretty standard but they offer great prices that easily beat Safeway and Bashas.  I wish their produce selection was better but it's still pretty good.  The "stuff" section of Target is always the best.  I love their quality items and their great prices.  You really can't beat it.  The best thing about Target is that they put money back into the community.  They are responsible for keeping the Children's Museum open for free on First Fridays and they donate part of their profits to local schools.  Target you rock!   Also, you are on the light rail which, to say the least, kicks serious butt.

Newly added to the Copper Square restaurant scene is Sonoma Casual Dining. While the name leaves as much to be desired as "Snakes On A Plane" the menu plays out in much the same fashion. On possibly the most up-and-coming corner along the lightrail, Sonoma has opened on the corner of 1st Ave and Van Buren, directly across from Central Station. This prime location should provide ample foot traffic once the lightrail hub begins to buzz.  It is unfortunate because those passengers will not find much at Sonoma. The place is usually packed with an after-work crowd drinking and listening to the live music on the weekends. They seem to be lacking diners however, after 2pm. While this Order/Take Number/Wait style may work well for the on-the-go lunch crowd, it translates poorly for the dinner bunch. Casual is one thing, sloppy is another.  A ridiculous abundance of chicken on their menu begins to make me feel like I am back at Lo Lo's. The problem is, this chicken is over cooked (a-la Zoe's). Featuring a "rotisserie" along with a menu of fake Italian dishes and something called a "Cowboy Steak" one needs to worry if the owners have ever been to Sonoma.  They are clearly trying too hard and have lost their direction; recently opening up an espresso stand and smoothie bar. "Inexpensive Excellence" is the motto at Sonoma but at $8 a plate the price seems high for lunch and the quality seems dismal for a place striving for excellence.  Sonoma also serves breakfast and has a full wine list. By the time you've read this review, there will probably be a kid-play area and they will serve bagels & cream cheese too.

How I want to give this place 5 stars.  I grappled with it for at least 5 minutes before finally writing this.    The location is killer.  Not only is it in 'Slope (which is an awesome neighborhood) but it is an old fire house (complete with garage doors) and has a beautifully shaded patio.  Really top notch.    The panino I had, with manchengo, pesto, and salami was AMAZING.  Even the chips were good.  The menu was a little lacking in things that interested me but the one thing I found was simply the best.  The service was dreadfully slow.  For a couple sandwiches that should only take 5 minutes to make, the 15 we waited was too long.    I grapple with comparing this place to Postino because they are so similar but where Postino succeeds in great service, Bomberos food was just flat out better.  So many difficult decisions in life to make and choosing between these two wine bars could be the toughest.

The burgers are good, the fries are okay...  but the custom milkshakes are to die for.  I go for that reason alone.  Hells ya!  Cheesecake flavored milkshake, blueberries, cookie dough, etc etc etc.  Oh man, that's good stuff.  I hate the decor but you can get a milkshake to go and life is right.

What a great place.  I have to apologize to the owner for never coming here before now.  All of those hours, miles, and dollars I wasted going to Famous Daves - I think I've finally found a good BBQ place in town that is local. This place is easy to miss.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and, honestly, it isn't much more than some tables and a counter on the inside, but unlike Stanley's, this place has the food to make a statement.  The owner is pretty awesome (and a bit loud).  He is very helpful and friendly.  The staff is kind and courteous.  I felt like we were getting special treatment but this seems to be how they do business.  I had a two-meat entree so that I could try both the pork and the hot links.  The pork was really some of the best I've ever had.  Not dry, not fatty, just sweet and good.  The hot links weren't too hot but the sauce gave them a nice kick.  I ordered the Cajun Fries and the beans as my sides.  The cajun fries were seriously good.  They might be my favorite fries in town.  Nice and crispy.  The beans weren't really my style but there wasn't anything wrong with them - I just wanted sweeter ones.  Finally, the blueberry cobbler was great.  Much better than I expected.  The perfect ending to a great meal. I know where I will be headed whenever I want BBQ.

So we took our British friends here last weekend (I know, I know...it's like taking your Italian grandparents to Olive Garden) and totally had a great time.  It's pretty far from being a "british pub" though.  As someone else said, it is more of a frat house with a bar in the middle.  Sure they have a picture of the Queen and some football scarves up on the wall but really, what gives people?  Pool but no snooker, throwball on the TV but no football, and way too many American beers.  They did have Strongbow and Newcastle so our group was very happy.  I have to say, the best part is that the pool was free.  It's really hard to find a place with a free pool table and now that I've found one, I think I'll be going back more often.  In any event, it was cleaner and more brightly lit than George & Dragon or Seamus so it gets extra points for me.  I also love the porch area where you can watch all of the idiots wait for Biancos.  Very nice.  Gotta go back and try the food!

Seriously? No Guinness?  WTF!?  How am I supposed to watch soccer without a Guinness?  Oh, that's right, you don't have the MLS stations so I can't watch my favorite team.  The food was pretty bad too.  I'll stick with Turf of G&D, thank you.

I hope I don't get lynched by the Lucky Boy-loving Yelp Mob but this place wasn't outstanding or anything.  It was good but nothing spectacular.  The burgers reminded me of Dick's in Seattle and the shakes reminded me of Frisko Freeze in Tacoma.  That's a good combination, no doubt, but I just don't get the 5-star love.  It's good but not amazing.  It's an awesome spot and the employees are friendly and speak english.  I can't complain about that, I guess.  In any event, the food is pretty good so go by and check it out.

I love the Fox Sports Grill in Scottsdale.  It is one of my favorite places to do Happy Hour and watch the game when I am up North.  But of all the crappy restaurants at Westgate, this is possibly the worst.    We went a week or so after they opened and it was moderately busy.  Nothing crazy, but busy enough.  Went inside and told the hostess that we'd like to sit outside.  We were seated on the patio and saw a couple waiters roaming around the patio area so we figured that we were good to go.  10 minutes later, I went back inside and told the hostess that we hadn't received any service.  She apologized and told me she would let them know.  5 minutes later, after watching another waiter walk by us, I went back inside and grabbed him and told him we had been waiting.  He told us that we weren't his table and walked off.  We left after that.  We tried it again a few months after that.  We sat inside and figured we would have better luck.  While our waiter did actually show up this time, the food took forever and he brought out appetizers and meals at almost the same time.  The food is decent so it gets an extra star for that but with service this bad when the place is slow, I can't imagine what it is like when a football or hockey game is going on.

I'm still not comfortable with how long it takes for servers to get to you and for the kitchen to turn out food, but the food is good.  I only wrote this update to give an extra star in support of the most amazing server I have ever had; J.  Go and ask for him.  If he's not there, tell them you aren't coming back till he is.

I'm not sure about all the love of this place.  It was good but I'm very surprised that this many people enjoyed it.  The bread was good and the fact that they have Wiz is great but the steak itself was just decent.  I mostly gave them 4 stars because of their selections and options.  Chicken option, provolone option, Wiz option, salads, etc.  That's pretty awesome if you ask me. Was it the best cheese steak ever?  No.  Was it better than Corleones? YES.

It has been a while since we've tried somewhere new in downtown. In all honesty, it is difficult to try new places when all of the new places are only open for lunch and I don't get home until 4pm. That is why we were pleased to see a new place, right down the street, opening up and actually staying open until 8.  The Breadfruit is the work of Dwayne Allen. As far as I can tell, he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the places that are going in downtown. The space is quite inviting. Small open lofty area for dining with seating for about 24 people inside. Bright green walls and faux-brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed ducts. I felt like I was at home. There were two tables set up outside as well providing an inviting option in the cooler months but the local foot traffic was a little sketch.  The menu is different. There are words that you recognize surrounded by words that you don't making ordering a bit difficult. Most likely, you will go with the word you know and order based on that. My party seemed to have done just that.  After a lengthy wait to place and receive our order, our table was full of food.  Plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney - this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges. The group enjoyed; I was less than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate.  Escovitch Fish and Festival - Friend got this. She seemed to enjoy it, not finding it to be nearly as spicy as it was made out to seem. The fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent.  Brown Stew Chicken - Friend got this. He seemed to find it to be skimpy. Compared to some of the other dishes, the meat was significantly less existent. There were also some bones in the chicken.  Jerk Shrimp - Wife got this. She thought it was good but was suffering from the spice. She is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her. The shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them. Also, the tails were removed which earned them big bonus points in my book.  Jerk Chicken off the Grill - Mine. If ever a dam breaks and floods downtown Phoenix, I know that we will be safe. The chicken at Zoe's Cafe and The Breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water. I couldn't imagine drier chicken than at Zoe's before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body. Terrible, simply terrible. Realizing that the chicken wasn't spicy at all by my standards, I ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable. The chicken was surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that was hard and dry, a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernels on it that I actually had to use a knife to cut them off (something I hate). There was also a pile of ital coleslaw which was a combination of sticks and rubbish that traditionally makes it into the bin at most restaurants. Hard times call for desperate measures.  Drinks did include a wonderful selection of "Jamaican soda". The ginger beer was great but very sugary. My wife tells me that the pineapple soda was a little strong and could have been a bit subdued. She also complained of the sugaryness of the sodas.  In all, Breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood. I was not surrounded by dirty hippies with dreadlocks and the owners were good people. I would recommend that people try it once but I would never suggest it as a place to go for dinner.  Also, keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative reviews of his place on Yelp.

NoRTH is always hit or miss with me, but the one on 67th is consistently good.  We went with a group of five and were treated great with excellent food to compliment our awesome server.  We split a bottle of Pino Noir, an artichoke app and a calamari app.   I had a pork tenderloin with Italian potatoes and asparagus for my meal and it was wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  Three people at the table each ordered a pizza and the chef screwed up one of them.  They brought her out the peperoni & onion pizza, boxed it, and promptly brought out the correct sausage & onion pizza.  To compensate us for the order, the waitress even offered us free dessert to take home.    Despite being one of the only tables in the place, we enjoyed the atmosphere on a late Sunday night and we really enjoyed the wonderful service.

This place is pretty awesome.  We went in to pick up some pizzas for game night with Ashley A. and ordered a white pizza and a peperoni pizza.  The employees were very nice and chatty as they made the pizza.  Very friendly, back-east feel to this place.  The pizza took about 15 minutes and stayed hot till we got home.    The white pizza had a thick layer of ricotta cheese on it with garlic mixed in.  It was heaven.  The slices are large and NY-style.  I didn't get to try the peperoni but no complaints were heard.  I would totally go back and try a calzone.  The only reasons this place isn't a 5-star are the parking issue and the limited space inside.  This place shares a lot with about 4 others stores and the lot has maybe 10 spots.  It is a tight fit and intimidating if the place is busy.  That alone would persuade me to go elsewhere.  The seating inside the joint is maybe okay for a party of 2 but I wouldn't bring more than that in here.  I'm pretty sure I'd go back or, if anything, have them deliver.

This location makes me hate the entire Einsteins franchise.  Seriously, the people who go here never know what they want and just dick around in line.  Then, on top of that, the people who work here can't manage to get an order right - ever.  I always get a pb&j power bagel...except for when they are out of power bagels (which seems more common than one might imagine).  What I end up getting is a rock hard power bagel cut in half with peanut butter on it and a little container of jelly.  Um, why am I doing your job?  Aren't I paying you for the ability to make a bagel?  Why must I do this?  I hate spreading jelly on top of peanut butter and since you decided to but pb on each side of my bagel (AND TOAST IT, which I didn't ask for) I now have to do this disgusting task.  I hate you and everything about you.  I also hate macbook guy who sits at the 4-top with his laptop in one spot, his bag in another, his iphone in the third, and his coffee in the fourth.  Thanks for takin up the whole table d-bag.  I'll make sure to spill my drink on your Prius on my way out.

Really a cute place.  I loved patio area and thought the service was great.  Big giant Oreganos-sized soda cups kept me happy and the crowd was a great mix of people.  Also, there was no wait on a Saturday morning which is a good thing since we drove by Over Easy and there was a small mob standing outside.  As far as the food goes, it was okay.  On par with Denny's or IHOP, I guess.  The hashedbrowns were overly hashed and turned to mashed.  The breakfast sandwich I had was pretty tasty but was only saved by the massive amount of cheese on it.    I might got back but there are so many other options.  I give it four stars simply because no wait, food is adequate, and the service is excellent.

I love Cold Stone.  I've been patronizing them since they were just starting up.  Now they are a huge corporation and sometimes I have a hard time going because of it.  The one thing that makes it easy to not go is the AZ Center location.  This Cold Stone is staffed by the laziest, rudest, worst employees ever.  Most Cold Stones get a bit chaotic because employees are running around trying to get through the line of customers.  Not at AZ Center.  They operate in slow motion, if they operate in any kind of motion at all.  There are always 4 or 5 employees working but almost all of them are in the back.  The one out front does all of the work and usually takes a break between customers to go into the back to txt someone.  Asking for anything beyond a simple scoop of ice cream is turned into a chore by these kids.  Don't you dare ask for a smoothie or something that requires them to "go get something from the back" because you may never see them again.    The girls that work here all have 6 inch fake nails and the boys all have tear-drop tattoos under their eyes.  It is a wonder that management doesn't fire them all but, after seeing a manager, I realize that this business is simply a front for either prostitution or dealing drugs.

I don't know what is wrong with my wife but she has the worst experiences when eating burgers at burger joints.  Strange.  While she may not have enjoyed herself, I certainly did.  I had the magic mushroom burger and, despite some of the magic missing, it was still great.  Tons of onions and lots of mushrooms made for a wicked good burger.  The fries weren't bad either but I wish they didn't serve them in a paper bag.  Seriously, for $5 you can't beat the combo deal.  Much love to the hippies - can't wait to see how the Breakfast Joint turns out.

Wow!  After a very disappointing first time experience at YC's I had sworn off this Mongolian BBQ nonsense.  I found myself stuck in NoPho with nowhere to go and decided to give this one a try.  I am so very glad that I did.  What a dramatic difference between the two places.  SFP has actual meat.  Not meat flavored frozen cardboard but actual slices of turkey, beef, chicken, and pork.  The veggies are all fresh.  They even have things like pineapple which really make a difference when it comes to creating one of these things.  So there really isn't a lot to mash down at this place (unlike at YC's).  You just pile the stuff up and it doesn't really cook down in the same way.  Mine didn't really change size much going from fresh to cooked.  The stir fry was awesome and I cannot wait to go back here.  It might become my regular spot in NoPho.  The price was great for what I got but I would suggest that you just order it in take-out form so that you can take whatever you don't finish home with you.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the buffet food.  Didn't really love.  The pork and chicken had been sitting out a bit too long.  I'm okay with that.  I didn't go here for the buffet part and I won't be visiting it again.  In all, it was a good experience.  The owner was super nice, the employees were very friendly, and the service was great.

I'd really rather give this place 3.5 stars but I decided to bump it up instead of bring it down because the food was really quite good.  I had the pulled pork which I really enjoyed but thought it was a bit fatty.  I also had some sweet potato fries which were excellent but they were given to me inside a paper bag.  That just makes them so unappetizing.  Oh well, it was still good.  Be ware - they only do cash.

Whoa this place is amazing.  I can't believe I found something edible in downtown Mesa.  One poor guy behind the counter banging out pizza, calzone, stromboli, and all sorts of other goodies - I'm impressed.  The calzone I ordered (meatball) was one of the best things I have ever had.  The sauce is sweet, the dough is garlicy, and the fillings are plentiful.  This place is not only somewhere I would tell other people to hit up but somewhere that I would make a special trip to go visit.  Fortunately for me, it's near Ashley A's house.  She better not serve me pizza hut again after showing her this place.

Based on a recommendations from my friends at Downtown Phoenix Journal, we ventured to La Piccola Cucina. This brand new spot on 7th St just North of McDowell on Oak is fit into a Tudor-style home. Immediately I appreciate the historical preservation that is going on here. The front patio is filled with cafe tables with red umbrellas, inviting on a summer evening or during the Spring but not at 5:00.  We were greeted inside by co-owner Debbie who brought us around to the dinner case. La Piccola Cucina is very different than most restaurants you will come across. Part old-world Deli, part Luby's Cafe, diners can chose their meal a-la carte or can, for $9.99, pick up one "protein" and two vegetables. Strange as that sounds, it actually works very well.  Their "protein" selection is made up of veal, pork, and asparagus stuffed meatloaf, turkey, a couple different chicken selections, stuffed pork, and a few other meat dished. Their vegetable sides ranged from ratatouille, orzo, zucchini, asparagus, potatoes, beets, and a few different salads. This wide selection allows you to cater to your taste buds for the evening. The woman in line behind me was a vegetarian and she was able to order a nice selection including a salad.  My wife ordered the meatloaf with orzo and potatoes while I had the pork with ratatouille and zucchini. My pork was excellent, covered in a fig reduction glaze that really brought life to the pork. The ratatouille was one of the best dishes I had ever had combining sweet and fresh tastes perfectly. The zucchini was good but could have used some garlic and salt. My wife raved about the potatoes and thought the orzo was quite good as well. Then we got to the meatloaf.  I am not a meatloaf person but my wife loves it. I was intrigued by the sound of it but I am a pork person and will almost always order it. This meatloaf was more along the lines of a toasted meatball than an American meatloaf. Filled with veal and pork (two essentials in making a good meatball) it was perfectly crisp on the outside and had a small scoop of tomato sauce on top. The flavors were a perfect mix while each was distinctly unique and separate. Definitely a meal I would recommends to any and everyone.  The drink fridge was filled with an interesting mix of beverages you would find at Cost Plus or AJs. No beer but a nice fruit-soda and mineral water selection. Of course, they also had a fully functional cafe with coffee and espresso drink selections. If they could get a BYOB permit, they might really take off.  As we finished our dinner, the dessert counter that had been calling my wife was explored. Mini cheesecakes of assorted flavors, personal (slightly bigger) caramel cheese cakes, chocolate mousse, cream puffs, cannoli, tiramisu, and some traditional Italian cookies. Everything looked exquisite but my wife, predictably, went for the caramel cheesecake.  I, however, directed my attention at the gelato bin that contained about 10 different flavors. I went directly for the mint chocolate (my weakness) but there was chocolate, limoncello, blood orange, some coffee flavor, and some others. All were beautiful rich colors but the mint was all mine.  Both desserts were fabulous. There is a need for a traditional Italian pastry deli in downtown and there is definitely a need for a gelateria. This fills both needs and is a short stroll through the Coronado neighborhood from the light rail. La Piccola Cucina also serves sandwiches for the lunch crowd at around $7 or $8 a piece and they sound wonderful. This place is highly recommended and will positively see our business again.

Took the light rail late on a Saturday night.  The place was busy but we were able to sit at a community table.  I love when places will seat you at a table with others.  I love being able to chat with new people and share the dining experience.  The owner stopped by and made a few comments and left us alone which I also thought was nice.  Our waiter was a bit slow but it seemed like he was working the entire place.  He also dislocated his knee earlier in the shift but kept working through it.  We forgave him because he had such a good personality.  I ordered the Pizza Burger which sounded great but didn't really deliver the way I expected.  A patty filled with Italian sausage and mozzarella and covered in marinara is a great idea but it fails in its execution.  The meal was cooked well and they get extra points for trying something new, but the blend of tastes was lost inside the patty.  I much rather would have seen the sausage and cheese outside of the patty, stacked.  The flavors would have come out more.  The wife got roasted vegetables & shrimp pesto.  The pesto was wonderful but she felt like the veggies (zucchini, squash, asparagus) were a bit bland and were overpowered by the pesto.  She enjoyed it but, again, it could have been executed better.    We ordered a pizza-cookie thing (like at Oreganos) for dessert.  It came out burnt and was just inedible.  The sugar was super caramelized and tasted like caramel in some places and tasted like burning in others.  I had to complain because I just couldn't eat it.  They busted out another one in about 5 minutes at which point I realized that they had a conveyor belt oven (like at Quiznos) and were cooking the thing at way too high of a temperature.  The second one was decent but it is better just about everywhere else.  The saving grace of Maizie's is the atmosphere.  It is really just a nice place to hang out.  You can watch the train go by, there are a bunch of TVs that you can watch the game on, and the workers are friendly.  The food isn't bad but they need a bit more experience in the kitchen.  This is a place that has a ton of potential (and a decent happy hour) so it deserves some attention.  Check it out and see for yourself.  Update: Went for late lunch/early dinner on Monday.  Mondays are apparently "Burger Monday" which constitutes a $3 Bistro Burger.  Great deal.  On top of that $5 appetizers and cheap booze during happy hour dramatically change the dining experience.    I had a half a tuna salad sandwich and a bowl of peperjack, potato, & broccoli soup.  Both were very good and came with a pickle.  The wife had the $3 Bistro Burger.  She ordered it medium and it came well done.  She said that it was good for $3.  I'm going to give this place another star because the waiters are caring and make sure everything is right and the deals are great when they have them.

Seriously, what a disaster!  I can't believe this place is even in business with the newer, nicer Jo-Ann's so close.  Still, what a nightmare going in here over the weekend.  We waited 30 minutes in line to get a roll of fabric measured and priced.  We were buying the whole roll but they still had to measure it.  Then we waited 30 more minutes in the check-out line.  The excuse? " A bunch of people called out for the [Rock n Roll Marathon] race."  Well, that's why you call other people to come in and work or, why you fire people.  Take your pick.  I'm never going back here.  I hate being this close to the rez to begin with but after this joke, I'm staying away for good.

I really can't say much more than anyone else.  It is hidden and you'll probably miss it.  It is small and you may not get a table.  Service is awesome.  The pizza is amazing.  Really amazing.  It may be the best in Arizona.  I don't know if there is better pizza but it sure ain't from Chris Bianco.    I just wish they had a Sicilian-style....so no 5 Stars.

Talk about a FEZ knock-off.  Here I was, all excited to see something interesting pop up in the boondocks of the valley and this is what I get?  What a waste!  To start, this place is small.  Not that small is a knock on a place (I love Matt's) but this is just inefficient use of space.  They've added some sun-shade and a patio to create more tables but it just looks tacky.  The bar takes up almost half of the interior space and does not appear to do the business that the tables do.  Poor execution of use of space.  Then, the waiter we had was a pretentious ass.  He was pushy, insistent, and not helpful.  It is amazing he even asked for our orders and didn't just bring us what he thought we should be eating.  We had some sweet potato fries and calamari for appetizers.  The fries were good but no where near as good as FEZ.  The calamari was more fried carrots and lemon than meat.  The fried carrots were fine but the whole thing was pretty cheaply put together.  What they don't tell you online is that almost all of their sandwiches are not served after 4.  Since that eliminated everything that looked good on the menu, the wife and I ordered a bunch of sides and split them.    The mac & cheese was pretty good.  The cornbread was fine.  The garlic mash was missing the garlic.  Really disappointing.    This is not a place would would recommend, even if I lived out there.  If I were stuck out in Surprise, I would go to the BabbO on Bell before I wasted my time at Vogue.

Not really a fan at all.  It's great for those of you on the WestSide but it is a long drive from the center of the city.  That's not the theatre's fault, but it is an annoyance.    The positives: they have Dbox seats which are totally worth the money. They have WhiteCastle burgers  The negatives: The tickets are weird The food is overpriced The hallway is narrow and gets crowded when there is a movie with a line. The "all digital" projectors are nice but they are not High Def.  They are just digital.  That means you don't get any of that film grain or the pops that celluloid has...but you still get the same quality picture.  HighDef is the way to go and, as far as I know, Harkins is the only ones with it. The

I seriously didn't know this place existed.  Glad I found it though.  They have Wellness dog food and they are on the opposite side of town from Wag N Wash so they give me a backup place to go when we're low on food.  Gotta love convenience.  The toy selection is a little sparse which is too bad but they have quality products instead of quantity.  They have lots of top quality food and the layout is great (especially if your dog is pulling you around the store).  I still like Wag N Wash better just because I can get my dog a bath, get him toys, and get his food all in one trip but for the times when I just need to get food I will remember Noble Beast.

In search of buffet food that was neither Chinese or Sizzler, we found Cubano.  Walking in, it seems a bit confusing but the sweet hostess/waitress was very helpful in explaining things.  I really liked that you could just start digging into the buffet without waiting for a ticket or standing in line and paying.  So we attacked the buffet looking to try a little of everything.  The item that stands out the most to me was the Yucca Root.  While it wasn't the best tasting thing on the tray, it was the most surprising thing.  I did not think it would be nearly as good as it was but it was amazing.  I even had a second helping.  I am a big pork fan and theirs was excellent.  The beef and chicken dishes were great too.  I had a bowl of the traditional Cuban soup (whatever it was called) and loved it.  Great food.  The dessert tray didn't look that great so we decided to try the "Best Flan' as voted by PHX New Times."  I am not a flan fan, at all, but we were feeling adventurous so we gave it a shot.  It was pretty good.  I'm not sure if it was great...the texture is too much for me...but I enjoyed the taste of it.  If you like flan, give it a try, I guess.  The place is a bit dingy and feels like an abandoned "Mariscos"-type place.  They did have baseball on so I couldn't complain about the entertainment.  The waitress was good but I can see her being overwhelmed if the place was packed.    I will be back, without a doubt.  It is a very short walk from the LRT station at Camelback and 19th so that is a big plus as well.  The variety and price make this a great place to hit up when you want some savory food but aren't sure exactly what you want.

Oh F&E, you have never done me wrong.  No matter the time of day or day of the week, I show up, and you cater to me in every way.  There are never any crying children trowing tantrums in the aisles.  There are never any middle aged women with carts parked in the middle of the aisle talking on their cell phones.  Best of all, there are never any people standing in front of me in the check out.   You organize your rows in ways that make sense and, in the event that I forgot something, it doesn't take me 10 minutes to navigate to the other side of the store.  You give me two options; your brand and the most popular brand out there.  This is exactly what I want.  I'm either feeling rich (pay day) or poor (every other day) and your options cater to those feelings.    You stroke my wallet in a way that only department stores have done before you.  "50% Off" beckons me and gives me the chance to try such foreign foods as fresh apples and pita bread.  You expand my palate in a way  I never thought possible.  Oh Fresh & Easy, you spring gifts upon me like $3.50 24-packs of soda before the Super Bowl and $1.88 1-pound ground beef.  I couldn't be more thankful.  You put every other grocer to shame and they know it.  F&E, my only complaint is that you are so far away.  You shun the light rail and you neglect downtown.  I know of a perfect lot at 3rd & Fillmore that would be perfect for you to settle down in.  Please come, quickly...I miss you.

Okay so I'm not usually a big fan of chains but we were out at Riverview and starving.  This was about the only place we had never tried before so it was worth stopping in.  I half expected Zombie Patrick Swayze to come out as our server ... this place LOOKS like the ROADHOUSE.    Anyways, I'm not in love with having peanuts sitting at my table.  If you have a peanut allergy you should not come here.  Also, if you like knowing where your food has been before you eat it, I would suggest not eating the peanuts.  Something about leaving salty child-sized food on a "family restaurant" table that worries me.    Anyways, our server was pretty awesome.  I'm usually unimpressed by the ASU student-turned-servers in this part of town but this kid was on the ball.  I tried the pulled pork sliders for my meal and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not fatty, lots of flavor, good bbq sauce.  Really a good meal.    This was a good experience and would probably sway me to go here over my favorite Chili's that is right next door.  They also have these little metal buckets that have chocolate shot things for dessert.  Didn't have one but I am totally tempted to go back just to try it.

I used to live in NY and while that may not make me a New Yorker, I think I know a little something about a real New York deli.  Hero Factory is the ONLY real New York Deli in Phoenix.  Every detail from the Metro ripping by outside to the obnoxious broad behind the counter calling my sandwich "naked", you almost feel like you are on Long Island.  The best part of Hero Factory is the bread.  They have some secret recipe for it that makes you want to buy it in bulk.  Anything they put on it is great but the top item is the chicken salad.  I know that is weird to say because, at a deli, you expect cold cuts.  While all of the hot and cold sandwiches I have tried are good, the chicken salad is better than anything around.    The other thing about this place that makes it so great is the location.  Not only did they go under the Orpheum Lofts, giving them some instant credibility, but they helped keep the corner of Monroe and 1st Ave alive after Nick's 101 went under.  They have some competition next door but the line is always coming out into the street by 11:30 during the week.  Biggest disappointment - they close too early.

The first time we went to District, it was for Mother's Day brunch.  They had a simple and effective brunch for a flat fee.  Sounded like a great deal and something that my mother would enjoy so we went ahead and made a reservation.  Everyone who worked there was very nice.  They all told my mother "Happy Mother's Day" and everyone said hi.  Our waiter was very helpful.  He kept our mimosas, coffee, and water full throughout the meal.  He even brought out the executive chef and introduced us.  Very nice.  The beauty of having a brunch buffet at a place like District is that you can try so many different things.  I love breakfast buffets and love being able to get exactly how much of each dish I want.  A summation of the dishes tried: *biscuits & gravy - buscuits were hard and the gravy was lacking in sausage flavor.  Not bad but not good either. *French toast casserole - tasty with a bit of fruit and chocolate inside it. A little mushy for my tastes but I could see someone loving it. *Sausage - Schreiners links were a bit spicy and completely amazing. *Yogurt parfait - served in a martini glass. Blueberries were fresh and tasty and the yogurt was great. *Assorted fruit - all of it tasted very fresh and was quite good. *sushi - not entirely sure what I was eating. There was a spicy tuna roll in there and some other things. They were good and tasted good.  Better than AJs. *shrimp - the shrimp was actually LOCAL grown in a shrimp farm in GIla Bend. Who knew? It was wonderful, fresh, and giant!  Great stuff. *orange cheesecake - the cheesecake was well done but I'm not sold on the orange flavor.   In all, the experience was great and their commitment to local ingredients combined with quality service will get me to go back for a normal lunch or dinner.

So after our amazing Mother's Day experience at District, we really hadn't gotten back since then.  Sure, we stopped by when they were having their $3 burger deal (which was amazing) but it didn't really seem to warrant an update to the review since it was another special.  This past weekend, we FINALLY got over for breakfast.  This place is always appealing because it is right across from the AMC and we usually hit up a movie early in the morning.  This morning, in particular, we were feeling a little adventurous so we decided to head over to District for their Breakfast Bar.  Now I'm a fan of breakfast buffets.  If we still had Shoney's here in PHX I would be there every weekend.  The opportunity for me to customize my plate to my exact specifications is never lost on me.  With District, they give you the most amazing ingredients to make your breakfast into a work of art.  A lot of the food was the same as our Mother's Day brunch.  It featured the creamiest eggs I've ever had, the tastiest Schreiner's Sausage, and some bomb French toast that I covered in the best Vermont maple syrup I'd ever had.  There was a litany of fruits, yogurts, and breads for me to try as well.  Really, this was simply the best breakfast buffet I'd ever had.  We are totally going back for dinner during AZ Restaurant Week to try some more.

Finally got out to SuperFarm after months of being tempted with butters, milk, and ice cream.  We did the tour and had a great time.  The people who work there do a great job controlling the children and really try their best to educate them.  Personally, I can't stand kids but the SuperFarm guys did a great job keeping the YMCA day care group that was part of our tour entertained.    There were lots of chances to get "hands-on" with the different products that they make and use at the farm, plus there was a petting zoo of sorts.  There are donkeys, goats, a goose, rabbits, chickens, and cows...lots of cows.  The whole thing is really cool.  If you have kids (especially you city slickers) or you just enjoy seeing where your food comes from, go check out SuperFarm.  While you are there, you can buy fresh butter, cream, ice cream, milk, and a bunch of other stuff depending on the season.  All of it is great.  I wish they sold at the Phx Public Market.  I'd live off their produce.

What the crap folks? So much "blah blah blah" "this place is so great" spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out.  I finally went to this damn place and I guess I am missing the point because this was a joke.  Their menu has all of about 5 things on it.  Most of them seem reasonably priced until you see their size.  I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I can't even taste the guac!!  If I want cheap good mexican food, I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster.  At least at 'Bertos I can get more than 5 items and the burritos are Soviet-car-sized.

WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not "stuffed" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.  I love this place!  It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more.

So we don't normally wait until 5 for dinner so it is really hard for us to make it to Tuck Shop.  Thankfully, we were off this past week and were able to finally go on a Friday evening.  We showed up at 5 and we were pretty much the only ones there for a while.  Big positives for having the baseball game on in the bar & for our waiter being pretty awesome.  I had seen in a tweet that they had a BBQ pork sandwich that I just had to try and it was really the only thing on my mind.  All of the nonsense about sharing and tapas was completely lost on me.  We did order what amounted to fried cheese sticks.  They were okay.  They were made with fontina cheese and the sticks were pretty good but the sauces just didn't do it for me.  One of them was even pear-flavored.  Ugh.  The wife also wanted to try the mac & cheese with "lobstah" so we got an order of that.  It was pretty good but was served too hot.  I know that sounds weird, but the cheese was all runny when we got it.  It wasn't until we were about finished that it turned into a creamy mac & cheese.  Too bad.  All of those complaints aside, I really didn't go for that stuff.  I went for the bbq.  Considering I had tried about 3 different bbq porks over the previous three days, I was beginning to consider myself an expert on the stuff.  The Tuck Shop bbq was wicked good.  It came with sweet potato fries that rivaled Fez (they were even cinnamon-sugary too).  The sauce was a bit spicy and really wasn't needed considering how juicy the pork was.  Really, it was great.  It was a special though, so don't show up looking for it on the menu.  Finally, we finished out our meal with a German chocolate cheesecake.  I'm not sure why I ordered this; I hate German chocolate and I can't eat cheesecake...but I ate some of it anyways.  It was so good.  Really one of the better desserts I've had.    To top this all off, I had ordered some lemonade which was actually really good.  I guess they make the syrups there in-house and, while not a traditional lemonade, it was pretty damn good and had free refills.  No complaints there.  Next time, I'm getting the ginger ale.

I can't stand this place.  Yet another yogurt company capitalizing on the FroYo craze of 2008 and this one is terribly executed.  Most of the places operate in a normal order-person fills order-pay-eat format.  Not MoJo.  They, for whatever reason, want to be different.  This means it is self-service almost the whole way through.    You wait in line for a machine that puts out the flavor of yogurt you want.  Then when you get there, it is usually blinking and telling you that you have to wait for it to freeze up.  Once you get a decent amount of yogurt, it usually tells you that you have to wait again because it has to refreeze.  10 minutes later, you have filled a cup comparably to what you usually get at a Full Service Yogurt place.    You then are given the ability to top it off with a tray of condiments similar to the breakfast bar at Holiday Inn.  Of course, you have no idea where those spoons have been and can almost guarantee that some 5 year old licked his yogurt, then stuck the spoon in it as he was pouring too many M&Ms on his frozen treat.  So you top off your yogurt in a manner similar to what you would find elsewhere and move to the next station.  You have no reached the end where you finally interact with a human.  This person then weighs your creation (mind you it is the exact same as one you would get at a full service yogurt place) and then he tells you that it will be $15.  I'm sorry what?  $15 for yogurt.  This size is $5 at every other yogurt place and you want three times that?  When I did all of the work?  Oh no.  These places are such a ripoff.  It costs them $0.08 per ounce of this stuff.  Unless you are covering it with caviar, macadamia nuts, and gold leaves - it isn't worth what they charge.

So I think, at this point, we are all familiar with the concept - build your own burger.  They give you a list and you check off the things you want, then the food magically appears.  Indulge is like the Scottsdale equivalent of CheeburgerCheeburger.  They have a few things working for them: 1)You actually write down what you want.  Not only does it make it easier for you to keep track of how your burger is developing but it ensures that the trust fund baby pretending to be your waitress won't screw up your order. 2)Higher quality ingredients.  While I'm pretty sure my black olives were from a can, the cheeses, meats, and other toppings seemed to be higher grade. 3)they do breakfast.  While I didn't try this...it sounds awesome.  I gotta go back.  I don't remember all of the weird things I did to my burger.  There was avocado, two kinds of dipping sauce, black olives, some sort of horseradish cheese (didn't know such a thing existed), and probably a few other things.  The burger was freakin huge (they could use a 1/4lb option) and it was so damn good.  If you're up here, stop by and try it.  Totally worth a visit if you're in the mood for a burger.  Just don't expect much else.

Well I went here last week and the sign said Wok N Grill but since their website says "Stix" and this is the same address, I guess maybe I got it wrong.  Just a heads up, you may see this place named Wok N Grill somewhere down the road.  So we walked in and the menu is insane.  There is way too much and far too many pictures of the food for anyone to make a reasonable decision.  So I asked the guy "what's good" to which he replied "besides everything?"  Oh har har - aren't you clever.  Now I'm pissed at you.  So after trying to drag an answer out of him, I told him I wanted spicy and he suggested boring Kung Pao Chicken.  I took his advice which, now, makes me more mad at him because it really wasn't good.  It was a giant plate of 10000 peanuts, 10 stalks of celery, and some giant mutant chicken.  Was there value for the meal? Sure.  Was it good enough to justify ever eating that much of it?  Absolutely not!  It was decently spicy but, more so, it was just hot.  Like - I stuck this in the microwave for 10 minutes kind of hot.    Let's just say, I won't be back here.  The staff was unhelpful and the food was insane.  You can usually tell if a place doesn't have good food because they give you a ton of it.  This is one of those places.

This place has been a long time coming.  It is damn near impossible for me to make it out to Avondale, ever, but we finally did last weekend and the first thing that sprang to mind was going here.  So very glad we did.  I ordered the chicken & sausage jambalaya and a sweet tea.  Their tea was pretty good, the jambalaya was amazing.  The dirty rice was some of the best I've ever had and the combination of meats and spices was perfect.  Really well done.  I would absolutely go back here if I ever made it out to Avondale again.  The only reason I marked them off is because of the location - far west valley, by a walmart, in a strip mall.  Too bad, downtown needs some decent southern cooking.

If this place were only closer to downtown, I would be there every weekend.  The biscuits and gravy are amazing and simply the best.  The chef is awesome and the service is wonderful.  They do a great job turning over tables and the size of the place keeps it from experiencing a Matt's-like backup outside.  Kudos to you guys at Breakfast Joynt for running such a tight ship.  I'm always impressed by great service from everyone.  We'll be back, without a doubt.

I'm sorry but no.  This place was not good.  It was tolerable and probably amazing for the people who live out here and eat dust all day but for those of us who like to consume something good for breakfast - this was a fail.    I ordered the "crispy" french toast.  Seemed like the greatest thing ever.  It's supposed to have the toast coated in frosted flakes.  Sounds great.  You'd imagine crunchy and sweet combined with the soft and slightly bitter toast making for a perfect combo - especially when syrup is added.  Unfortunately, I had to seek out the frosted flakes.  They were nowhere to be seen.  Then I turned the bread over and found where they were hiding.  Yup, under the soft, hot, moist bread.  Guess what wasn't crispy anymore?  Yup, you guessed it.  Combine that with poorly cooked french toast and cheap nasty syrup and I was not happy.  This was a really disappointing breakfast and as much as I like to support little "family" establishment, I will not be going back here.

Big props to Udder Delights for being awesome.  Not only did I get a TON of ice cream for cheap but it was also wicked tasty!  I tried a scoop of peanut butter and a scoop of chocolate fudge.  Both were thick and creamy with giant (giant meaning half a full-sized Reese's PB Cup) chunks in them.  Wowza.  The girl behind the counter was chatty and nice.  She put up with my bad jokes and attempts to be witty - which I always appreciate.  Service with a smile from someone who actually looks like they would eat ice cream instead of those damn wanna-be-models who work at Gelato Spot.    My only knock would be the location.  Not only is it in the middle of no where but it is in a strip mall, not facing the street, behind an Autozone.  It is possibly the worst location ever.  At least it wasn't ghetto.  If you get lost and find yourself surrounded by nothing but an Autozone and train tracks, stop and grab yourself some ice cream from Udder Delights.

So I wouldn't normally drive all the way to Cave Creek for anything but we had the week off, I had to go to Desert Ridge, and I saw this place in the Phoenix Magazine.  Needless to say, save the gas.  The place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise.  The sides all sounded good and I couldn't decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both.  Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans.    Where to begin?  The pork wasn't bad but it wasn't bbq.  I mean, it didn't taste smokey or sweet.  It tasted boiled...and that's nasty.  It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor.  The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn't have any of it out for me to get more.  What they did have were "regular" and "spicy" bbq sauces.  Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork.  The brisket was really a disaster.  It was cut like ham slices.  Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice.  This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits.  The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing.  The beans were okay but I expected sweeter.  BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory.  These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull.  I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn't help.  The saving grace was the potato salad.  This was some of the best stuff I've ever had.  I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party.  They should package it and sell it in the stores.  Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor.  Good stuff and well executed.  Will not be going back here.  Too bad too because it had a lot of promise.  Oh well.  There is no shortage of bbq in the valley.

This place is really great if you have a small dog or a cat.  Not only do they try and feature either local products or sustainable products but their prices are reasonable.  The owner does a great job knowing the details of his products which really helps if you have no idea what you are looking for.  My favorite part of this place is that they have a sale section where you can get some amazing deals.  We got our dog a rain coat for Seattle for only $10...and it is made of recycled water bottles!  How cool!

What a great idea.  This is almost the perfect breakfast place.  It really seems to get you in and get you out quickly.  I will definitely be back.  Walking in, you feel like you are in a Pei Wei that has working lights.  The place is bright and colorful - great to help you wake up.  The menu is along the side of the entrance (just like Pei Wei) and you order at the counter.  You place your order, get your number, and find a seat.  The food selection is pretty awesome.  Peanut butter chip pancakes, pigs in a blanket, cinnamon rolls, french toast...it all sounds so good.  We ordered a smattering of things to try and they were all great.  The pancakes that we ordered were buttermilk and they were great.  Light and fluffy with a cinnamony butter and maple syrup.  Good stuff.  The sausage was nice and spicy inside the pigs in a blanket.  It was great.  I can't wait to go back to Scramble.  Not as good as Matt's but it feels like a healthier breakfast that you could actually consume without waiting outside for an hour.

Well I almost feel like I should just edit my Seamus McCaffrey review and place it here.  Nestled in with Sens and Pasta Bar is the brand new Turf Restaurant.  A great addition to a great part of town that already has the best breakfast diner in the world, Asian tapas, and all the fresh pasta you can eat.  We showed up for their Grand Opening Friday Feb 27th.  Walking in, you notice a couple things.  There is a patio for smokers that is a bit more out of the way of the main entrance than McCaffrey's is.  There is also no host (like McCaffery's).  I love this and think there needs to be more places with this sort of seating arrangement.  The place is dark but classy.  Well lit at the tables and the bar looks beautiful.  Lots of dark woods and some subtle paintings of hill sides and whatever else Ireland has.  Very nice inside.  We tracked down a table and were discovered by a waitress after a couple minutes.  She brought us menus (something that should really be AT the table) and took our dink orders.  They have a standard array of non-alcoholic drinks and then the typical Irish pub beer list.  The menu says they have a wide assortment of whiskeys and, while I'm a whiskey drinker, that will have to wait for an update.  I ordered a Guinness & it was poured perfectly...as expected.  The food menu is similar to McCaffrey's but with a few notable exceptions.  The biggest one to me is the addition of Bangers & Mash.  One of my favorite dishes and it was executed wonderfully.  Two sausages, nice pile of potatoes, peas, and carrots.  Everything tasted fresh and the sausage wasn't over-spiced.  The gravy on the potatoes was wonderful.    The wife ordered the Corned beef and cabbage boxty and it was good as well.  It came with a side of horseradish sauce that really brought the beef alive.  We had also ordered the mini corn dogs from the kids' menu for an appetizer.  There were four corn dogs and a pile of fries.  Also very good.  For dessert, we debated over the "Chocolate Decadence Cake" or the "Whiskey Cake" & decided on the Whiskey Cake.  It was a nice-sized piece that was saturated in some of the best whiskey I've ever had.  I have to find out what they put on it.  The homemade whipped cream on the side really made the cake wonderful.  Really, the menu is about the same as Seamus McCaffrey's.  The ambiance and vibe of the place is much higher end.  Seems like a great place for after work or to go before an event.  It also seems more suitable for kids than McCaffrey's is.  There are a few HDTVs that had the Suns on when we were there as well.    The only other thing about The Turf was that they had a live band playing on opening night.  They were excellent; playing traditional Irish music and really rockin out.  They weren't so loud that you couldn't talk and they were out of the way enough so that everyone could enjoy them without being overwhelmed by them.  Not sure how often bands will be there, but it seems like a good venue.  All in all - great experience.  UPDATE: We've been back multiple times since The Turf opened.  Once for just drinks and once for breakfast.  I still love this place.  It doesn't try to do too much.  I agree with the reviewer who complained about the music, but there is a jukebox and whatever people pick, that's what we hear.  Service is always great once the waitress knows you are there but I still wish they would put the menus on the table like Seamus.    The breakfast food is pretty decent.  They have some traditional Irish breakfast that I was too scared to try (black & white pudding, no thanks) but also had breakfast burritos, omelets, and biscuits and gravy.  I tried the latter and it was pretty good.  It would be nice to see them make fresh biscuits every morning though because some of mine were too hard.  The soft ones were great and made the meal quite enjoyable.  I would like to see them scale back the amount and offer a side of fruit with such a heavy meal.  In all, it was good.  It wasn't as good as Matt's, but if you don't want to wait in line for an hour, it makes a good alternative.

Well, the newness has worn off and the cracks are showing.  After our disappointing St. Patty's Day experience (I still want a refund), I had been quick to forgive my favorite pub.  But after last weekend, I couldn't let it stand any longer.  Being a big soccer fan, I have to watch my team.  Being poor, I don't have cable, so I called Turf and asked them if they had the Sounders game.  The girl says yes so we went over.  We get there, sit down, and are ignored for almost 10 minutes.  I finally walk up to the bar and tell the girl that we'd like the game on and a server.  The server came over (who was not our usual one), took our drink order, and then came back with the remote for the TV.  20 minutes later, she still couldn't find the game and I was getting pissed.  The food came out quickly but I was there to watch the game.  I could have at least streamed it online and watched it in crappy quality.  The food was good, as always, but the waitress finally gave up and put it on some channel that was just infomercials.  Thanks...So I missed my match even though they told me they had it.  They need to train their staff to work the TVs AND they need to have the soccer matches on when they are on.  There were two MLS games at that time and NEITHER was on.  Infomercials and PTI or some nonsense.    Really disappointing.  I'll be back, I can't stay away, but you guys need to have the games on.  What a joke.  Call this an irish pub???  I NEED MY SOCCER.

You know the menu looks so good.  You really want to love this place and visit it daily because there is so much on the menu.  Then you get your food and realize that it is just not good.  I had a mushroom swiss burger with a side of sweet potato fries w/pesto-mayo dipping sauce.  The bun was stale (clearly frozen) and got wicked soggy, the patty was from Costco, and the mushrooms were drenched in grease.  Ate about half of it before I gave up.  The fries really weren't bad but they were no where near as good as Fez or even Deluxe.    I hated the interior of this place - it made me uncomfortable to sit there and watch this "chef" peel off paper from frozen patties.  This space would make a great ANYTHING ELSE but the cheapskates who run it are clearly just running a bait and switch job with the menu.

Okay well I already reviewed this place ONCE but YELP refuses to remove this duplicate existence of Burger Studio so I'm going to show you the link to the original one - http://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-studio-phoenix#hrid:bU7kzvjzLcPEFxFqmzcrDQ/  And then repost my review:  You know the menu looks so good.

I have been to every ballpark in the Cactus League and know my way around them all.  This is, by far, the best facility in all of Spring Training (that includes the Florida parks).  Granted, I am a Dodger fan and we get it better than the 'Sox fans do, but it is still amazing.  Camelback Ranch is the brand new, state of the art, spring training facility for the Dodgers and White Sox.  The Sox moved from Tucson because Tucson is the literally SO bad that even people from CHICAGO won't stay there.  The park is located just south of the Glendale Airport and pretty much only has one way in or out - 111th Ave.  You can avoid Camelback Rd by taking Indian School to 111th and then just drive into the stadium.  The grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields.  While the White Sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public, the Dodgers' are wide open and inviting.  Players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans.    The field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive.  Not only do they have a full Jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out $90 per game.  That price gets you seats behind home, access to unlimited food, wine, beer, soda, and sweets.  It also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off.  It sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money.  The grass seats have a great slope to them (much like Scottsdale) and the seat aisles are wide.  The food selection is lacking without Dodger Dogs, however.  The stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that Maryvale and Peoria feature.    A great stadium and surely one to visit every March.

Well this was an experience that was a long time coming.  My family is from Pittsburgh and as soon as I heard about this place, I knew we'd be making a visit.  That visit was, unfortunately, on the same day as the flea market that sets up outside of the antique mall that Willy's is in.  After 10 minutes of driving around trying to find a place to park, we got in.  There wasn't much of a line and we were able to order quickly.  Now, I'm not one to tell you how your food is made but when you say "all we can do is hot dogs right now" in response to my mother's request for a chipped ham slider - I'm not going to be upset.  But then, when you tell her that she can get the hot dog that comes with chipped ham, I start to get confused.  So I order my Genoa-style Big Willy and the counter girl tells me that I need to pay with my card up at the mall checkout.  I'm okay with that.  You don't have a POS or ATM so whatever works.  My bad for not having cash.  After waiting 20 minutes in the checkout line to pay for my food, I made it back to my table just before my hot dog got cold. The hot dog was excellent.  It really was premium.  The toppings were great.  This is a must-do if you are in this part of town. So while the POS snafu wasn't their fault, it would be nice if they had their own system.  It would also be nice if they had an option with fries on it.  I want a Primanti's and I don't understand why I can't get one at a place called Pittsburgh Willy's.  So if this place adds those two things, it becomes a 5-star for me.  Until then, I'll still go back, and love every minute, but it won't be complete.

While the Maryvale Stadium may be burdened with a location that most would be afraid to venture into, it stands out as the crown jewel of the Maryvale neighborhood and is, by far, the best stadium in the city of Phoenix.  Getting to Maryvale is a bit of a task.  It is on 51st Ave, just south of Indian School.  The easiest way to reach it is by taking I-10 to 59th Ave, go North, and turn right on Osborn.  There is free parking next to the apartment complex.  It may not seem safe but I have never seen any broken glass and my car is always un-touched.  It is worth the risk because the parking lot off 51st Ave is a nightmare.  The Milwaukee Brewers play in Maryvale and their fan-friendly attitude extends here in Maryvale.  The practice fields are all open for the public to mingle with the players.  The players must walk through the parking lot, past the front gate, to get to the clubhouse.  This gives fans an up close and personal experience that they would never find at a Major League facility.    The seating in Maryvale is also the best in the Cactus League.  The entire seating bowl is below street level and is covered with canopies.  The third base line is shaded for almost the entire game and most of the first base side is too.  The grass seats extend down the lines and wraps around the outfield.  All of the seats are close and most have decent spacing.  The food selection is great.  Not only do they offer each of the sausages featured in the Sausage Race (Hot Dog, Polish, Brat, Italian, Chorizo) but they also have sauerkraut.  They are the ONLY stadium that has sauerkraut.  There are also independent food vendors.  Make sure you try the kettle korn (free samples are always offered) because it is the best in the Cactus League.  There is usually a BBQ place and a Yakisoba Noodle stand that cannot be beat.  Beers are primarily Miller brand but they do have a handful of imports.  The fan friendly experience is what makes this park stand out.  Tshirts and other giveaways are usually tossed to fans from the first base dugout every couple of innings.  The Sausage Race always takes place during the top of the 7th.  They sing Roll Out The Barrel after Take Me Out To The Ballgame.  Even Bob Uecker makes the trip and sits in the booth calling the game.    Maryvale is surely a stadium that could turn you into a Brewers fan and could make anyone a baseball fan.  Once you are inside, you forget that you are in Maryvale.  Take a chance on this place and you will not be sorry.

Fine, because I'm tired of this place having such a high rating from fake reviews, I'm going to review my attempt to eat there.  We went by last week, walked over there, and the owner was outside.  He told us that they had a soft opening the night before and that they would be open Monday at 4pm for dinner.  Ok pops, we'll be back at 4 on Monday.  So Monday rolls around and we are starving by the time we get home from work at 4.  We walk over and there are two "chefs" standing around in the doorway chatting it up while smoking.  We walk up and are like...WTF?  And the guy tells me that the owner is out buying ingredients and that they might open at 5.  So I ask to see a menu and he says "we don't have menus"   Excuse me? "We type them up the day of..." Well that seems horribly inefficient and like a waste of paper.  So how am I supposed to know what you have to eat and if I want to come here?  Ya...that's what I thought.  So even though your horribly tacky sign with a car on it (that conveniently doesn't say your name) says you'll be open at 4, you're not open.  And even though you guys are the cooks, you don't know what's on the menu for the night.  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.    I'm on a budget so I'm not just going to walk into your place and eat.  I want to see a menu before I walk in.  Get your act (and your website) together and maybe I will be back.  Until then, I will just walk by and grab a sub at Calabria.

I'm not really the biggest doughnut fan but hey, every so often I want one.  The price of Krispy Kreme scares me away.  The ghettoness of Dunkin Donuts scares me away from there.  Lamars has good deals and great quality.  I really like that their selection is always different.  Went there before the election and they had special McCain and Obama pastries.  There are always plenty of employees so the wait is never bad and it is right off the freeway so it is convenient.  Can't say I'd go anywhere else.

This is one of the best boutiques in town.  Unlike most boutiques that just sell Ed Hardy crap, this one sells clothes and art designed by local artists.  The place is definitely hip-hop so make sure that suits your style.  The men's side is mostly t-shirts, hoodies, and jackets while the women's side has some dresses and other chick stuff.  They have tons of accessories like earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, and watches.  They also have a ton of shoes that are all customized by local artists.  Some of the artwork inside Culture Fresh is simply amazing.  There is this orange phoenix painting that I am in love with but can't bring myself to purchase.  Many of the pieces are also hip-hop inspired creations using musicians as the subject.  Cool stuff.  Everything is reasonably priced and the quality is pretty good too.  The stuff we've bought has held up well over the months.  It's a great place, check it out.  It is in the AZ Center, right next to the sports store, across from Hurry 4 Curry.

Easily my favorite Subway because it is always empty.  The lone person working in here will always be happy to have human contact and will help you out immediately.  This makes for a great experience, especially considering they will usually pile on the sandwich contents.

I'm not going to take the time to re-write the same story as Bri D. but I will add this -  If you can't manage to get food in front of someone 40 minutes after they order it, you should not be in the restaurant business.    It is breakfast.  It should take 10 minutes, TOPS!  I could have waited for a table at The Good Egg, been seated, and served in less time than it took for me to finally give up on this crap-tastic joke of a cafe.  No thanks.

Boy was I happy to see this place finally finished.  I've been driving by for months now, keeping a watchful eye on it, and now, finally, it is done.  I haven't been to the original in years so I can't really compare it but it feels the same.  Open, airy, industrial, fresh, and classy are all words I would use to describe it.  Really, a great conversion.  There is almost no parking.  It is a bit sickening to think about when you consider how crowded this place gets.  I appreciate transit oriented development as much as the next person, but the poor neighborhood around this is going to get mobbed.  The LRT is close but might be enough of a walk to turn people off (especially during the summer).  They have valet parking but I refuse to let anyone else drive my car so that was out of the question.  We parked across the street by the gas station, prayed, and ran across Central to get there.  There are like three entrances to this place but I guess you just sit wherever.  Service was good, friendly, and knowledgeable.  We were wicked disappointed that there was no sangria.  For a wine place, there should be sangria.  I had some Lion Stout beer that rocked my world.  The wife had some Riesling.  It was good too.  We ordered the NYC grilled cheese for a starter and it was great.  Came with pesto, mustard, and catsup and was sliced into like 6 small pieces.  It rocked.  I ordered some panino that was rocking a bunch of Italian meats, tomato, and some cheese.  It was great.  It came with homemade chips that would have been better with some more of that catsup.    The place was really just quality.  The crowd was good at 4 which was surprising.  The patio was packed.  The bar is pretty cool.  No hard liqueur but that's okay.  In all, well done!

Holy crap I cannot believe how bad this experience was.  Where do I begin?  Our waitress took forever to get to us.  When she showed up, she told us she would bring us water which took 5 minutes.  She brought the water and took our drink orders.  Of course the drink I wanted, which was on the menu, was no longer carried to I had to settle for a Guinness in a CAN (ugh).  The waitress disappeared for a while and the manager walked by and asked how we were doing and I reminded him to get our drinks.  We finally got those and then our waitress came back to take our food order.  Of course, since she was wearing half a dress, she had no pockets for paper or a pen so she had to go find one.  She came back took our order and disappeared again.  Then it got really bad.  The next time we see our waitress, she is busing a table next to us and, as she goes to reach for the door, she spills the catchup ramekin onto the floor, splattering catchup all over my friend's white shirt (I dodged the catchup like Neo dodges bullets).    So apologies were made, the manager brought out soda water to help clean up, and paid for our drinks...things were made better.    Eventually the food came out.  I can only speak for myself but I wasn't as enthused about my Grilled Cheese Club as I was when I read it on the menu.  For one, the "club" part doesn't really work.  The bread overwhelms the cheese.  For two, they swapped out Gouda with Swiss.  For three, the bacon was more like bacon bits instead of "thick sliced bacon".  It didn't taste bad...it was just not as good as it could have been.  The fries were pretty good though.  At the end of the meal, the three of us were only charged $16 for three drinks and three meals.  I guess that is a positive.  Really, the waitress was what made the experience so bad.  It's not really fair to blame the whole place for the mistakes of one...but they hired her.  In any event, she probably ruined the place for us and that's too bad.  It is close to the LRT and has some interesting food selections.

I seem to have made a mistake by ordering a gyro here.  Not only did it not feature any lamb but the slices of beef were entirely too large to eat gyro-style.  The taste was fine but it was a pretty basic gyro.  I've had better from a cart in front of Central Park.  Meh is a good word.  The lemonade was way too sour.  What's with the trend of the sour lemonade lately?  I shouldn't have to add a pack of sugar!   I will give this place another chance and order a cheese steak meal next time but the gyro is crap.  Also, what's with the Cubs stuff?  Cubs suck!

There sure was a lot of hype about this place over the past few weeks.  I finally gave in and drove out to see it for myself.  I was a little under-impressed with the inside but no bother.  I ordered one of my favorite BBQ dishes of all time - the loaded baked potato.  This one had pork which is really the only appropriate topping.   As far as the bbq goes, it was wicked good.  Some of the best bbq pork I've had from a local joint in AZ.  The potato, on the other had, was over heated to a fault.  Way too hard.  It wasn't so bad that it ruined the meal but it sure was a shame to screw up such good bbq with such a rock hard potato.  I might go back.  There are so many more bbq places to try.  There wasn't anything on the menu that made me want to come back.  It was really good though and, if I was over there (or their other location) it's probably the best bbq in that part of town.

Right across the street from my house is the new park and boy is it awesome!  I love everything about it.  The "Her Secret is Patience" sculpture, the light pillars, the solar panels that offset the park's energy use, the hills, the chess/checker tables, and the rehab of one of my favorite buildings.  Everything about this park makes you want to go there.  In a few years, those trees will be full and cover almost 75% of the park.  Tons of shade, tons of grass, and tons of love for the new Civic Space Park.

I had such a wonderful experience at Gallo Blanco.  I really contemplate going back every day as I drive by.  The sangria was pretty good (I prefer red though) and they had a full bar - so you have to love that.  The decor is sweet with a sort of rustic/modern/southwest vibe to it.  The cheese crisp tube thing was wicked good.  Can't say enough about the aioli that came with it.  Little spicy, lots of flavor - the perfect compliment.  As for my meal, the pork torta thing was wicked good.  Seriously, $6 for this?  Could you be any better of a deal?  Actually, writing this review makes me want to go back.  I might just have to tonight.  We had the weird pudding/marshmallow thing for dessert.  It wasn't my favorite dessert but it was really good.  Nothing quite like a s'more in pudding form.  The food did take a little while to come out.  I can forgive it because our waitress was so nice and helpful and because I enjoyed everything that I got.  I really sucks to wait for 15+ minutes for food and then have it suck.  Thankfully, this did not happen here.  Top notch.  Hopefully Clarendon finally has found a permanent tenant in Gallo Blanco.

This place is like soccer heaven.  How awesome!  Went to go watch the Galaxy play the Wizards and it made a great venue.  Right up next to the players.  No walls or fences to separate them.  Awesome!  They have a ton of fields and everywhere you look you see kids playing footie.  It's a great sight.  Hopefully some day facilities like this will pay off and the USA will bring home the Cup.

Seriously, how did this place get so many reviews in such a short amount of time?  Were we all just dying for a new place in CenPho or what?  Anyways, we finally went to the Parlor which opened while we were off staying cool in Washington, and I feel like we are late to the party.  Everyone has covered just about every aspect of this place.  Walking up, you see the garden where they grow herbs, eggplant, tomatoes, peppers, and a few other goodies that they use for specials.  Inside, the place has been renovated wonderfully and it is beautiful.  The old 60's-style wall is really made into the centerpiece of the restaurant and I love everything about it.  I tried the Watermelon Agua (vodka + watermelon juice) and it was amazing.  Be had the eggplant bruschetta and it was a wonderful combination of sweet and tart.  Brilliant!  We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and a potato pizza.  The pepperoni was by far the best because the meat was perfectly spicy and, I imagine, from Schreiners.  Finally, we had some lemon pudding with raspberries with a ginger cookie.  Strange combination but excellent.  The food was outstanding and our server was one of the best I've ever had.  Can't say enough about how great this place is.  Glad to have it and ESPECIALLY glad to have it by the Colonnade (which is a culinary vacuum.

I was totally surprised last weekend when I drove by this corner and saw a new consignment store where a clothing boutique used to be.  I always love consignment (when affordable) so I made sure we went when we had a chance.  Some of the things in here are amazing.  While most of it isn't exactly my style, there are some real bargains hiding in here.  Way cheaper than the places on 7th Ave!  If you are looking for antique/used quality furniture, you should definitely stop by here.

Wow.  I'm not sure if Alicia A is an owner or just crazy but my experience is much more in line with Larry's.  Really slow service and subpar food at OUTRAGEOUS prices.  We showed up on a Saturday morning and were quoted a 20min wait for our party of 3.  That wait only took about 10 mins since a party of 8 ahead of us disappeared.  We were seated in a lonely table in a giant empty orange room that would soon become the waiting room.  After five minutes or so, someone showed up to take our orders.  We put in our orders and waited again.  She eventually brought out our drinks.  Everything here is served in glasses that you would expect to see fresh-squeezed orange juice served in - 6-oz glasses.  Inevitably, these glasses would sit empty for most of our experience.  And what an experience it was! We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for our $8 waffles.  Yes, I said $8 for a waffle.  Mine was chocolate chip.  Giradelli's you ask? No...regular cheap semi-sweets.  How many waffles you ask? Just one.  Was it tire sized? Nope...about 8" diameter.  Sounds overpriced?  You bet'cha.  So our food finally came.  The waffle was alone.  No toppings, no sides of bacon or hashedbrowns.  Nothing.  Just an $8 waffle sitting on a plate insulting me and my debit card.  It then proceeded to insult my calcium intake by challenging my teeth to Mortal Kombat.  This was the crispiest waffle I had ever seen and that was not a good thing.  No malted creaminess to enjoy.  No love whatsoever.   Ages went by before we saw a server again.  We were surrounded by waiting patrons who I just wanted to tell - Go Across The Street To The Good Egg!  It was an uncomfortable situation that was only made worse by the pool of yellow liquid under our table and the realization that it never went away even after we told someone to clean it up. Eww.

Wow I was so disappointed with this place.  Lots of hype and tons of memories of real candy shops got me all excited that Smeeks was one of the first places we hit when we got back into Phoenix.  Can't say I've been more disappointed by anything in CenPho.  To begin, it is really a cute place.  I love the colors and the styling of it.  It does look a lot like Frances and RHR next door but that's to be expected.  The layout works well and it is totally a place that invites you in to spend money.  The downside starts when you realize that this is simply a downsized Archie Mcphee mated with the candy section of prizes from Pistol Pete's Pizza.  One wall is covered with junk from accoutrement.com and the other has over-priced lame candy.  $1.50 for pop rocks? I don't think so.  Of that wall of candy, half is licorice flavored which totally doesn't count as candy to me.  I know this place just opened so I am willing to give it some time to restock and find their market place but I would have been happy to just see something simple like Nerds or Jawbreakers or freakin M&Ms!  That's what downtown really needs...not another store trying to be kitschy by selling stuff from Accoutrement.

I honestly have no idea what I ate.  Nothing on the menu was familiar to me and when I tried to order certain things, I was told no.  I got pork something and pork something else in a combo plate.  It was damn good though.  We had tried some samples of things and I wanted the pork sample and then I saw some beef and pineapple thing on the menu that I really wanted.  I think I was told "no" and that I had to order off the giant board on the side.  That didn't really make any sense to me since the menu above the food said it was their regular menu.  In any event, then I said that I wanted the pork thing that was on the menu (because it was the only pork thing on the side menu) assuming it was the thing I had sampled.  The girl then repeated the pork thing and then gave me two different kinds of pork things.  If this is all confusing to you, how do you think I felt standing there.  As I said, in then end, I was quite happy with my food.  Very flavorful and the price and quantity were great.  I will be back, without a doubt.

Well I gotta say, I love this place compared to the trash it used to be.  So glad to have tables and lighting and waitresses.  It's the little things...  My hatred of the former Fate has kept me away from here for over a year.  We finally got over there last weekend and boy, I'm glad I did.  We ordered the rice cakes to start.  They looked and tasted like french toast- IT WAS AWESOME!  Then I ordered this pork dish that came with long green beans and some pear mush.  I know my description is not that great but the meal was pretty good.  The pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a very nice sweet/bitter combo.  The pear stuff was possibly my favorite part of the meal.  Very strong flavor with a great consistency.  The beans, however, were a bit of a disaster.  I tried to eat them first, fearing they would get cold, but they were already starting to get cold by the time my plate came out.  I ate a bit until I couldn't handle any more.  I gave up after that and ate the rest of my meal.  I came back to the beans and they were ice cold at this point.  They were actually better cold; they had firmed up a bit and were crisp.  For $21, I just don't want anything wrong with my meal.  For dessert we tried the blueberry thing with the sorbet.  It was sweet and light.  Really an enjoyable treat.  I'd like to see something else for winter time since this was a very summery dessert, but it was still amazing.  One of the best desserts in downtown.  I'd probably go back but the price will always make me think twice.  There are better places at the same price point where I get a much more substantial meal.  This was, however, a very good experience that I would recommend.

I finally tried Pho.  It has taken ages but a nice cold rainy sunday afternoon was enough to convince me that it was time to try this soup-like concoction.  I sure am glad that I did!  This stuff was great.  I ordered one that had meatballs in it.  The meatballs were a bit more like sausages but they were still tasty.  I'm probably not the person you want to listen to when it comes to Pho reviews since this was my first try but I really enjoyed it.  For anyone who has thought about it but never gone - this seems like as good a place as any to start.  My only problem was with the service.  They were very disorganized and slow.  It was busy...but I'd still like to see a bit more hustle from the waiters.

Don't know how I missed this place but I had never been here in all the years I've been going to the ABC store across the street.  Amazing.  So hit this place up during the USA-Canada Gold Medal game and was surprised at how large it is.  It is really two places in one...a Tavern AND a Grill - just like the name implies.  So we sat on the restaurant side and had pretty great service.  They had a ton of stuff on the menu that looked good but I went with the Take Em All burger or something like that.  It had chilies and avacados and bacon and all sorts of cheese.  It was pretty intense.  It was cooked exactly how I like it and the curly fries were pretty excellent too.   This place is actually really awesome and I'm going to be looking at coming by on a Tuesday night to try their cheap wings.  Who's comin with me?  (Oh, I didn't give them 5 stars because they have Pepsi and because there are peanuts in a bucket on the table and peanut shells on the ground. That means I cannot bring my friends with peanut allergies here which sucks.)

My wife keeps dragging me here.  I have no idea what I would want here but they have doggie stuff so at least there is something for me to look at while the wife plays apothecary.  They have doggie shampoo and doggie perfume which is pretty cool - plus a couple other dog items.  They are also happy to treat your dog to a treat, a drink, and a bit of perfume if your bring him/her in to the store.  That's pretty cool.  I love dog-friendly places.   The women who work here are very nice and helpful.  They always have lots of suggestions and they aren't too pushy.  I wish this place wasn't in Desert Ridge since that place feels more like a Jr High hallway than a mall.  Also, the stage is just outside of Bath Junkie so there is usually some loud obnoxious music blasting in.  Not very relaxing.  The product here is great though and if you are up that way, I'd suggest stopping by.

Well this place is part of the Larry Miller conglomerate of dealers so right there, you should know that it is a terrible place.  I didn't know that until I was leaving, otherwise, I never would have even gone in.    We were greeted by a French-American whom I could barely understand.  He brought us inside and showed us the Nissan Cube that was inside the store.  Nice, since it was hot, but it wasn't the trim level we had asked about.  He made us sit for 10 minutes next to a screaming baby while he talked to his manager.  As if the noise from the ScreamMachine and its Breeder companions wasn't enough to give me a headache, he then came back and tried to tell us that we shouldn't want the car in the brown color because we would never find it.  He then took us outside and showed us MORE cars that weren't the right ones.  What a waste.   Will never go back there again.

Um hello - BEECHERS!  The fact that I can go a mile down the street and pick up a brick of Flagship (and Flagship reserve) just makes my day!  My Seattle cravings have been slightly tempered by the introduction of this fromagerie.  I love that they make their own mozzarella and will be frequenting them quite often.  Thank you so much for bringing us something so amazing to CenPho!  I can't wait to go back.

So San-E-Tize (as I like to call it) has been staring at me every time I go to F&E and I finally convinced my wife to try Thai food.  We went over here on a Saturday night and I was totally excited for a new place.  But then the bad service started.  We were seated, then ignored, then we got drinks, and were ignored again.  Then we were asked if we were ready to order (which we were) and then ignored again.  This was getting a little old. I finally ordered a Sweet Basil something with chicken.  It was a runny mess that was lacking in meat.  It needed noodles or rice or something to thicken the dish up.  It really just wasn't very good. I ordered it with a #4 spicy level and it was about there (maybe a 2 or 3 in my book).  I don't know if the 6 is insane or not but I don't know who would be willing to ruin their meal just to try and find out. In the end, I wasn't really impressed.  The large tables are just comical, the service is sub-par, and the food was just blah.  I posted a picture of my meal just for reference.  I might go back and try something with rice next time but this was just not what I wanted.

By far the least busy of all G-spots I've ever seen.  Either the economy has killed the gelateria business or we just got there at a good time.  Either way, happy helpful employees were quick to get us in and out.  Going to G-spot reminds me of how much I hate the people who work at the AZ Center Cold Stone.  G-spot employees actually pretend to enjoy their jobs while CSC employees make your life miserable for invading their time.  All of that aside, this is a great location if you want to avoid the crowds in Arcadia.

What a lame store.  The employees didn't say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.

Well I just had to make a special trip out to the Valley's first Smashburger.  I love a good burger and while nothing really competes with the Fez Burger, this place will be making a run for the top spot.  Walking in, this place is pretty nice.  The color scheme is a bit of a nod to the traditional diner but without all of the red leather bar stools and diamondplate.  That's a good thing.  The people are very friendly and helpful (plus there were plenty on staff).  The menu is available outside (which I like because it helps make the line go a bit quicker) and they have a build-your-own card for your personalized burger creations.  In other words, they do everything that the Two Hippes Breakfast Joint doesn't.  Pretty sweet.  The food took 3-5minutes or so to come out.  We ordered ours To-Go but ended up eating outside.  It comes in a nicely packaged, especially if you were going to a picnic or something like that.  Nice presentation for to-go.  I ordered the Arizona Smashburger which was pretty much what you would expect it to be (no, not dusty).  Semi-ironically, this burger is called the Baja Burger elsewhere but the premise is the same - guacamole, peperjack, chipotle mayo, jalapenos on a chipotle bun.  Gotta say, this was actually on the slightly spicy side.  A nice change of pace from places that claim to have spicy food but never do.    The burger part of this meal was the best part.  Not only was it cooked to a perfect medium (you might want to specify if you like it more done) but it was a big juicy patty.  You could tell it had been a ball of meat that had literally been smashed into its current form.  Just like I make at home.  The burger was a bit on the salty side around the edges.  Not sure what that was about but I LIKED IT!  Really it was a damn tasty burger.  Finally, we also ordered some "veggie fries" which I sort of expected to be like veggie crisps.  They were just fried veggies.  Carrots and asparagus cut into little sticks with some salt.  It was good & came with some ranch dressing.  Simply not what I expected.  The final big plus about this place is its location.  Very happy to see a new place by a LRT stop.  You can never have too many restaurants by the LRT and having this one so close to the Vet/College stop will be great for football lovers, ASU students, and LRT riders like myself.  Well done Smashburger.  Bring on the chains.

Boy I thought about this review all day yesterday.  I even wanted to sleep on it before jumping to any conclusions.  When it comes right down to it, I just don't think I am a fan of the Two Hippies brand. From their poorly spelled "Pizzaria" sign to their magic burgers that made my wife sick, I haven't seen a lot that should impress me.  I expected this place to be quick when it came to breakfast.  I'm not sure why, I just did.  Maybe it was the take-out window or the confined dining area or the to-go boxes that every meal uses.  Most of all, I think I expected it to be quick because it is just breakfast food.  It really doesn't take long to throw something on a hot griddle.  After waiting in line for 15 minutes, we got up to the front to order.  They have a "breakfast bowl" that includes up to 6 toppings for $6.  Pretty good deal, in my opinion, so I was gonna get that.  As I ordered, the guy wrote everything down (in longhand) and then punched a bunch of stuff into the register.  This whole process took a while (and took forever for people with complicated orders).  After asking to see what lemonades they were out of (which as a lot of them), I got a Guava one.  We paid for our food and the guy then told us that it would be 30 minutes.    Since we couldn't go sit outside because an employee was smoking within about 2ft of the open door (SO ILLEGAL), we found a small table in the back.  There's not much to look at and really not much going on.  The people are pretty normal and there wasn't a lot of food coming out to look at.  This gave us plenty of time to wonder why some scrambled eggs took 30minutes.  So when our order finally comes out, everything is packaged in these giant plastic take away boxes.  Not only does this go against my own inner-hippie but it is bad for your business.  These containers are not cheap and they take up a TON of room in your trash.  Both of these issues cost you time and money.  They also don't do much for my "bowl" concept of a meal.  In any event, the presentation was underwhelming even for Two Hippies standards.  The meal was decent but pretty greasy.  I had sausage, potatoes, mushrooms, and jalapeno jack cheese in my 'bowl' which included "toast."  That toast was more like buttered bread that was thrown on the same griddle as the greasy potatoes that made the base for my meal.  While the taste of the meal wasn't horrible (the toast was horrible) it really wasn't worth sitting around waiting for 45 minutes.    My issues with this place a many.  They have a giant sign outside that says "BREAKFAST ALL DAY" yet they stop serving breakfast at 11:30!  Matts, The Breakfast Joynt in Scottsdale, Black Bear, IHOP, Denny's, etc etc etc all serve breakfast later than 11:30.  What gives with the horribly false advertising?   The bulk of their menu is non breakfast items.  Really?!?  I can get a burger at 6am but I can't get bacon and eggs at 1145am?  Why do you even serve lunch stuff?  Just do breakfast and do it well.  Your kitchen wouldn't get so backed up if you didn't have such a giant menu. Get rid of the waffles and pancakes.  They are just gonna slow you down.  Do the breakfast bowl and some sides.  That's it.  You could bang out breakfast for 1000 in under an hour that way. Why don't you have order slips?  Wouldn't it make more sense for the people waiting in line to fill out their order instead of having you write everything down?  Just have a list of all the items available and have people circle what they want.  You check it to make sure it is 6 or fewer, charge them accordingly, and pass the ticket on to the kitchen.  It would speed up your whole concept. Finally - why do you let your employees smoke out front?  You just can't do that.  The next time, I am filing a complaint with the State.

Well we were standing outside the doors 10mins before they first opened...that's how excited we were for this place. After watching for months, we finally have a new restaurant in town with a little more attitude than Parlor or StFrancis. Hula's is aiming at the kick back & relax crowd which fits me specifically. Good food is only good if I can pair it with a great drink & Hula's doesn't disappoint. Really, this place is great. To begin, the renovation is wonderful. On par with the other CenPho restoration projects of the past year - this one stands out by creating a period piece instead of going for a more modern style. There's a fire pit & plenty of outdoor seating along with a wonderfully decorated interior - all separated by some moving glass garage doors (like Postino). The best piece is their sliding table bench. It's hard to describe but a wonderful feat of engineering. The appetizers were pretty great. The sweet potato fries will give Delux a run for their money & are savory & crispy. The cevice is served with some oversized wonton chips that have a great flavor. The cevice itself has a bit of spice to it thanks to the peppers. The main dishes are a bit limited right now but the coconut chicken is simply delicious. With a sweet & spicy sauce over a perfectly cooked coconut-crusted chicken, this dish comes with rice & black beans. Really one of the better dishes I've had...plus, there was a lot of it. I had originally ordered the pork but had to steal the chicken from my wife. It was just too good. For dessert we just had to try the key lime pie. Not only was it NOT some frozen green brick (like most places) but it was a whole mess of complex flavors that made it the best key lime pie I've ever had. The servers were friendly & attentive. The owner came by & was receptive to input. The chefs were quick & the bar tender was heavy handed with a bomb Trader Vic MaiTai. Everything was great. Add to all of this the fact that it is on the LRT & I can't help but think I'll be spending a lot of time here.

The Brioche French Toast was one of the nastiest things I've ever eaten.  I was not going to wait in line at the CenPho location so we made a trip to the lesser known newer one for our first Over Easy experience.  I'm quite a fan of French Toast and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect french toast.  This was not it.  Not only did the filling turn the center of the toast into a giant tapioca-looking mushfest but the batter that coats the french toast does NOTHING to give it flavor.  It's called vanilla people, a big bottle at costco is only $4.  Use it.  What a disgusting mess.  I tried putting the syrup on it.  Of course, it didn't come with "REAL MAPLE SYRUP" but I was welcome to use the catsup bottle at the table that had been filled with the thinnest, corn-syrup based syrup known to man.  At least my meal had some flavor after that.  This will be my one and only trip to any Over Easy (or other Aaron May restaurant).  What a joke.

So I saw this place on Chow Bella when they first opened and I'd been meaning to get there for weeks.  Unfortunately, I never really knew where it was so it never occured to me to look for it.  So we happened to be driving to Parlor the night before and I spotted it.  The next morning, we were up (late) and headed right for it to get some breakfast.  We were a bit worried they wouldn't be serving breakfast at 11 but they were happy to make it for us.  I ordered the breakfast bowl with sausage.  Now, I'd like to refer the Breakfast Joint people to the breakfast bowl here at Hot Rod Grill.  THIS, is how a breakfast bowl should be done: 1st - it should be in a damn bowl. 2nd - it should have two layers of cheese. 3rd - it should not look like soup on the bottom of the bowl from all of the grease.  Hot Rod does them perfectly.  This is exactly how breakfast should taste.  It may be $1 more than breakfast joint but at least you don't have to look at naked hippies while you eat - PLUS - the food takes the normal 5-10 minutes to prepare instead of the 30+.    I'd be wary of this place if you don't like traditional 50's diner style places.  If you hate 5 & Diner for more than just their terrible food, you probably won't like this place.  It isn't overwhelming like Ed Devebics but it doesn't try and hide it.    If you just finished reading this, you should really bookmark it and try and go next weekend.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Matt & Ernie's new place is wicked cool.  Situated in the bottom of an architect's office and across the street from Survivor's Park, this is sure to be a great place.  We got to go check it out during a sneak preview last weekend.  They are going to be rocking coffee, tea, bottled drinks, Tammie Coe sweets, and a lunch sandwich or two.  Can't wait for them to be open full time.  **Update** Since Joel pointed out that my review wasn't quite supportive of my 5-Star review, I'd like to add this  Well, I'm not a coffee drinker - so I don't really compare coffee shops on the taste of their coffee, I compare based on ambiance, design, and selection.  I know that seems weird but what else am I supposed to do?  The tea I had was good, they had a good selection of bottled drinks, and the place is more inviting than Lolas, Lux, or Copper Star (all of which feel small and crammed to me).  It's a place where I would actually hang out and to me, not being a coffee drinker, that is what makes it as good as it gets.

First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their "grand opening" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.  Boy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I'm weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn't get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I'm just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn't make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.  My next complaint is the selection.  I'm not even going to complain that you don't have basic things like fruit or butter.  I'm going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.  Finally, what's with the "wine bar"?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?  It really feels like too much room was wasted on the sandwich/wine bar counter area and not enough was set aside for actual groceries.    I know this place will get better but right now one would be pretty hard pressed to do their grocery shopping here.

The BEST burger in the city.  Hands down.  No nonsense, no options, no choices.  Leave it the way it is because it is perfect.

We were looking for something different after a quick stop off at Chandler Mall and found this place.  Despite being tempted by the Spicy Pickle next door, we went ahead with Lucky Lou's.  The place wasn't very crowded and the waitress told us to sear ourselves and she quickly brought menus and got our drinks.  They had Coke instead of Pepsi, so I was happy. We started with this cajun shrimp app.  It was basically jambalaya without the rice.  It came with some toasted bread and was really amazing.  I would have rather just had jambalaya but this was a good starter.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  It was about $12 though, which seems high for an app but it had about 8 very large shrimp in it so I guess I feel like I got my money's worth. Then I had a burger that was actually topped with pulled pork and cheese.  This was one of the stranger things on the menu so I had to try it.  The burger, by itself, wasn't very good.  It was cooked more medium-well than medium and was pretty flavorless.  The pork, however, was excellent.  There wasn't nearly enough bbq sauce to make the whole thing work though. This place has quite a menu.  Full of sandwiches, burgers, salads, and a few random Louisiana-style meals.  There seems to be something for everyone here but I feel like you may need to micromanage the preparation of the meals.  Everything is just ALMOST there.  If they had added rice to the app it would be been perfect.  If they had spiced up the burger, it would have been perfect.  I just feel like they are almost there.  I might go back, but I think I'll try the pickle place before I go here again.

What a great concept!  What poor execution!!  This place is rubbish.  It is literally like a yard sale inside a building.  There is no atmosphere, no color, no style, no substance.  The record selection is minimal and the candy selection is actually worse than Smeeks (which I didn't think was possible).  I have no idea how this place pays rent but it should be closed.  At least then homeless people would have a place to stay - providing more value than it does right now.

Holy crap - what a disaster.  I can only pray that the ones on the east coast are better than this.  If this really is Obama's favorite place, I might have to reconsider my support of him.  I don't even know where to begin.  Let me just make a list of WTF items: Wicked loud music with no theme or genre A bin of peanuts that people manhandle while in line Peanut shells on the floor "regular" burgers have two patties "little" burgers that are $5  Just a disaster.  Go to Smashburger, please.  You'll love it.  This place, however, is a joke.  Also, if you have a peanut allergy, I REALLY wouldn't recommend going in here.

Totally an unsuspecting place.  You see a place next to a gas station and you don't assume good food but Sam's is actually pretty damn good.  Decent price for a gyro combo that includes pretty good fries and a soda.  Can't hate that.  The gyros are huge and full of all sorts of goodness.  Still not the best gyro ever...but pretty good for "gas station food."

What a disaster.  I don't get the love of this place at all.  I'll agree with Patrick L on this one: William-Sonoma with a hot case.  That's all this is.  Where do I begin?  First - the layout.  This design might be nice when one or two people is in the store but on a Saturday afternoon, this place had 30 people in it and was insane.  The layout does not help.  Not only are there three sets of lines that merge into each other creating all sorts of pile-ups but there is no where to go that you aren't in the way.  Racks of food act as line partitions more than they act as display cases.  It is really a nightmare.  Second - quality for the price.  It is a ton of high-end stuff and that's okay.  I have no issue with high end products but ... where the hell do you get off charging $5 more than some place like Delicious Dishes?  I can get the same products at a LOCALLY OWNED store for significantly less.  There is nothing special about what you stock.  You don't make these cheeses yourself.  These aren't your livestock being slaughtered.  You get this stuff from the same supplier that AJs, Trader Joes, and Petit Fromage do yet you charge like you're the only game in town.  Finally - You call that a deli counter?  The girls working here have probably been using a meat slicer for 2 months and couldn't tell you the difference between mortadella and sopressata.  I'm sure they don't know how to cook it and can guarantee that they don't know proper pairings.  No thanks.  I'll stick with Delicious Dishes in Phoenix and keep my money local.

Oooo this one is nice.  Unlike the giant brand new big box versions of Hobby Lobby that they dropped into Avondale and Gilbert, this one lives in an old Mervyns.  Because of that, there is a TON of room and everyone is really spread out.  Hobby Lobby is like 1000X better than a Jo-Ann or Michaels and this one is the only one in CenPho.  If you are tired of waiting in line at Jo-Ann's to have your fabric cut or tired of the slow checkers at Michaels, go here.  I promise, you won't be disappointed.

Finally got around to trying Caffe Boa.  After watching Payton butcher a pig at Devoured, I really had no choice but to see what kinds of food this guy pumped out.  I was impressed with the giant paper cone of french fries that I ordered an an app.  They were quite good and the sauces that came with them were out of this world.  The calzone that I ordered was probably not the best advised decision I've ever made.  It was good and I enjoyed the strange flatbread that housed the innards but it just didn't give me what I was looking for in a calzone.  It was good, just a bit weird for my tastes.  That's not to say that everything inside the flatbread wasn't good - it was.  I just wouldn't order this again.  The service was good and I enjoyed the patio but the strip mall feel left a lot to be desired.  I hope rent is cheap.

I wanted to give this place a second go-around before writing my review.  I felt like I might have just been over-hyped into believing this place was THAT great after my first encounter.  During that trip, I had the Coronado Coney  and it was amazing.  So I went back last night and got the Tuna Sandwich.  It was also amazing.  So I give in to the hype and award my five stars. The place is awesome. I love the house, the layout, the tables, the servers, and the location.  I LOVE the old school hip hop music - it totally makes this place unique.  I love the food that is accompanied by homemade crisps and a kosher pickle.  I love the happy hour that runs till 6 and the accompanying beer selection. I love this place.  One suggestion - dump the damn 4 Peaks beer.  Everyone has it, it's not that good, and there is better stuff out there.  Also - add a cider to your selection.

LOVE LOVE LOVE This place!  Scottsdale places are pretty hit or miss, in my opinion, but most of the things that come out of FRC is excellent.  This one is no exception.  Besides the $3.75 blueberry beer (which is cheaper than it is in Whole Foods, the food is wicked good.  There are so many things on the menu I cannot wait to try but the pork belly cubano was a must.  It was the best one I've had since I left New York and I've even visited Miami since then.  Great food, good prices, awesome wait staff.  There are a bunch of great reviews on here that go into more detail than mine...but all you need to know is that this place is great.

I have been to the Culver's in Surprise and it made me sick beyond reason so it was probably not too smart of me to try eating at this one, but multiple yelpers told me that the Surprise one was the worst and that I should try another one - so here I am.  I don't get this place.  The menu is huge.  It is some weird hybrid of an A&W mixed with Long John Silvers and a KFC.  I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try sea food or fried chicken so I went with a basic single patty cheese burger, small fries, and small drink.    Let's start with the fries.  They are crinkle-cut which makes them look cool but they taste bland.  There is so little flavor in these fries, they might as well have been made of tofu instead of potatoes.  The drink? Culver's Root Beer.  Nothing to get excited about and not nearly as good as an A&W or Barq's.  Finally, the burger.  Most burgers come in patty form.  You would expect your burger to have some meatiness to it.  You would expect something juicy.  Not at Culver's.  Here, they give you a beef chip.  Literally this is a piece of meat that has been flattened to the size of the bun.  Unfortunately, they must have started with a really small ball of meat because my burger was only a millimeter thick and was crispy - like a potato chip.  I have included a picture.  Not only was it thin and crispy but it wasn't very good.  The burger was really just a disaster of an attempt at fast food.  I will not go back here.  Fool me once...

I really love this place.  The girls that work there crack me up and they can get you in and out quicker than anywhere else in the Marketplace.  Their prices are decent and their food is great.  The orange chicken is some of my favorite.  This place is very much like Panda Express but thankfully doesn't have that terrible Panda flavor (eww, panda flavor).  Bri sums up this place pretty well.

WAY out in Glendale, inside the airport, is a little tucked away cafe.  It doesn't have anything special on the menu and isn't some hidden gem but it does bring the best breakfast in Glendale.  That's not really saying much but compared to the junk they try and serve around the west side of town, this place is an oasis.    Why so great?  Well, the servers are good, quick, and friendly.  The patrons are pretty interesting since there is a mix of people vacationing and locals.  The food is slightly different than your average breakfast and is surprisingly light on the grease.    I ordered the french toast.  This is sort of my test-case for breakfast.  It is hard to find good french toast and really, I've yet to find AMAZING french toast in the valley (BTW, that Over Easy attempt at french toast is a disaster).  This french toast came with some sort of cinnamon & honey butter mixture that tasted as good as it sounds.  Spreading that on what would have been some fairly average pieces of toast gave this meal a whole new level of awesomeness.  Yum.  My wife, well, you can read her review whenever she posts it but, it was an AWESOME looking breakfast sandwich.    Way impressed with this place.  A great find.

I don't mean to get nitpicky but you're not really a game store.  You are more of a model and figurine store.  That's cool.  I mean, I'm not really in to that stuff but, if I were, I would totally come here over a place like Gamer's Inn.  Nice open layouts with lots of natural light and a paint bar.  Way cool.  Unfortunately, I'm not in to that stuff.  I like board games.  You had board games, yes.  They were tucked away on one small wall.  You had all of the basics - Ticket To Ride, Catan, Munchkins, etc. but you didn't really have any decent games.  You had nothing from Queen Games and I don't even think I saw anything from Rio Grande Games.  That's a pretty poor showing from a game store.  Also, this place didn't really seem like it was inviting me to bring a group to sit and play for a while.   I guess I am mostly disappointed because you mislead me and let me down.  That's okay, I forgive you...but I won't be back.

Much love to the Fili-B's that saved me from hunger after Red Bird Cafe starved me of breakfast.  The register girl was friendly, spoke english, and the food came out quick.  It was as good as always.  A sausage burrito has never tasted as good.  Thanks Fili-B's!

Went to the VIP Grand Opening last night for the new Smashburger.  This one is awesome.  Not only is the location close to CenPho but it fills in a space that is in need of decent food.    The new Smashburger is on the side of the Best Buy next to the Cold Stone.  They have some outdoor seating and big windows so that you can see in and see what is going on.    The place is nicely laid out and there are a decent number of tables (more than the Tempe location).  The staff is friendly and helpful.  As far as the food goes - well, it is Smashburger.  You can expect to get yourself a salty burger, some slightly greasy fries, and a yummy HaagenDaz shake.  If those are up your alley, then you will love this place.  In my opinion, they make the best fast food burger around.  If you haven't gotten out to the Tempe location or the new Avondale one yet, go hit this one up.  Im sure it will be packed come lunch time.

SO excited to have a decent chinese place in downtown that is actually open after 5!  As much as I love China Chili, I just can't drive up there all the time.  Having Hsin around is going to improve my culinary options.  We went during their grand opening.  I ordered the orange chicken and it was very good.  Some of the best orange chicken I have had, actually.  It was a bit weird though since it was accompanied by a fruit salad and cucumber slices.  Very odd choice of a side.  I liked getting fruit but some of it got the orange sauce on it and wasn't very good.  Oh well.  The people who worked there (especially the younger girl) were awesome.  Lots of personality and very helpful.  This place will quickly become a take-out favorite of ours.

What an awesome experience! This is an adaptive reuse project that rivals Parlor or St Francis in every way.  The inside is gorgeous with bright colors, natural textures, and inviting seating.  The outside is bright, airy, shaded, and relaxing.  I can't say enough about the amazing renovation that was done to this old bank.  Being that I've never been to the Arcadia version, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  Since the primary reason I had never been to the Arcadia site is the parking nightmare, I was not surprised to see a similar issue here.  We, luckily, showed up at 4 before they got slammed and were able to park right up front.  We were seated on the patio and loved everything about it.    Our waitress was Raven (whom John H also recommends) and she was great.  Very helpful and friendly.  I have to say, for an upscale place with a snooty vibe, the service was impeccable!  She kept our drinks full and kept the table clear of used dishes.  We started with the crab and artichoke dip.  It came with these weird sweet potato chips that were covered in some spice combination I couldn't quite place.  The chips were thick and firm with a lot of flavor.  The dip was full of crab (surprising) and had a great texture to it.  I really enjoyed it.  For my entree I had a pork tenderloin salad.  It was possibly the strangest looking thing on the menu and I just couldn't resist.  The tenderloin was sliced into about 9 pieces and displayed very nicely over the bed of arugula, dried fruit, hazelnuts, and some wicked lemon dressing.  It was an awesome combo that was EXACTLY what I had been looking for that day.  Really enjoyed it!  Happy hour is something like 3-6 with half off most appetizers and like $2 off drinks.  The menu is pricey but not Scottsdale pricey and I feel like the value is there.  Sit outside, if you can.  You won't regret it.  I'm glad we went for the opening because I doubt I'll ever be able to get back in here once the neighborhood finds out what a jewel they have.

I absolutely LOVE my new gym.  I cannot even imagine going to the Y compared to Golds.  Not only do the workers know your name but they are also approachable and helpful.  Unlike any other gym I've ever been to, they come up and ask you what you'd like to see them add.  They are there to show you how to use the equipment and they don't make you feel like an idiot when you don't pound 300lb weighs.    Despite the stigma that comes with a Golds (body builder types) this one is full of business types who are just trying to stay fit.  Everyone who goes is friendly and no one is there to "show off" which is a nice change of pace from the LA Fitness over at Town & Country.  The equipment is great.  Everything is new and state of the art.  The cardio equipment has individual tvs that even allow you to plug your iPod in to.  You can actually watch your downloaded movies/shows on the large screen.  They get cable and HD so it's great when you want to run while watching Glee or the Real Madrid match.  The locker rooms are the antithesis of every gym locker room you've ever experienced.  Private showers, toiletries, laundry service, keypad lockers, and an awesome sauna.  I've spent about 3 hours here every day since they've opened.  It's such a great place.  Can't say enough about it.

Well, despite having (ugh) tapioca (ugh) that they stick in tea, the Republic is a pretty awesome place.  Now my wife tells me that this is different than Pho but I don't really see how.  It's a bowl of scalding hot soup full of noodles and meat.  Anyways, this stuff is really tasty.  Way better than the cup of noodles you lived off in college.  I tried the Republic which was apparently the spicy one.  It was decently spicy but I still added some of that magic red sauce.  It came with a side of edemame which had been steamed and lightly salted. The workers were all friendly and helpful.  The interior was very nice and made me feel quite welcome.  My only complaint was the price.  I feel like $8 for a bowl of noodles is asking a lot.  Especially in Tempe.

Holy crap. Not only is this place in an awesome location but it has one of the few menus that I literally could not decide what I wanted to eat.  It's a strange little corner spot that Nourish occupies and the layout is a bit on the minimalist side but that's okay.  They have a nice patio and their air conditioning system does a good job keeping you cool inside.  The hostess and waitresses were all very nice and helpful and really everything is very appealing about this place when you come in.  Now let's get down to the food.  So many things to choose from.  We started with some Mac & cheese and with a bowl of chili.  The mac & cheese is not your creamy style but rather the crunchy kind.  That's not really what I want when I order mac & cheese but this stuff was really tasty.  The Three Bean Chili was REALLY good.  It was pretty spicy though, so be prepared.  For my entree I went with the Spicy Southwest Burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  I had the burger on a challah knot.  It was a strange compound of potatoes & beans made into a patty topped with avocado and cucumbers.  Sounds weird but it totally worked.  I would order extra cucumbers next time.  The satisfying crunch of them breaks up the soft textures of the potatoes, beans, and avocado.  The challah knot bun was AWESOME and one of the best pieces of bread I've ever had.  Finally, the masterpiece of Nourish is their Sweet Potato Fries.  I will go on record as claiming these to be THE BEST sweet potato fries in the valley.  That means BETTER than Fez and WAY better than Delux.  They are air fried which means they are healthier than your normal fries & they are lightly covered in cinnamon (and something else I can't quite decide).  The thing that makes them so great is their accompanying side of dipping sauce.  I don't know what it is or what god they had to kill to procure it, but it should be bottled and sold.  The combination of the two makes Nourish worth the stop if only for a mid-shopping trip snack.  You don't have to be a vegan to come here but at least it is a place you can go and get normal food & keep your friend's dietary needs in mind.  Check it out.
