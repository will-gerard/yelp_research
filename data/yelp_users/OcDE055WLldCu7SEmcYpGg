This place was decent. The happy hour was a good deal for food but the drinks were weak. The prickly pear margarita was very small. The location is close to the Phx Art Museum which is convenient, but it would be hard to decide to return. The server was very nice.

Friendly staff.  I Came in and got quoted to install iPod support/new deck on my bmw, made an appointment because they didn't have one of the parts. A week later, I came in at the scheduled time and they forgot to order the part. I Came in a week later, and after inspecting my car, they decided they could not do it. A little annoying after having my car there 3 times prior and them not checking it out.   I put a 40 dollar deposit down for reasons beyond me. (Don't put a deposit down on anything. I see no logic in it after going through the motions) Make sure to get a receipt if you do and keep it- you apparently need a large, yellow receipt if you're dealing with the owner. I physically came to the store and the owner would not credit my credit-card charged deposit. I Called in with my deposit information and still waiting to be credited a day later. *the 40 dollars was reimbursed 48 hours later.  I took my z4 to the dealer and they installed an iPod player with a nice mount where the unused ashtray was. Cost $250 and took 1 hour.  I would recommend this place if you make sure the person in the back can look over your car and confirm they can handle the job. Don't put a deposit down. Get a quote locked in and written upon first visit. All that being said, the staff is friendly.

Best pizza in Tempe. Some of the best in Arizona.

I went here last night with a friend of mine after a long break of simply forgetting how close House of Tricks was located to me. The ambiance and table setup strike a nice mix of casual and refinement. you're going to be comfortable there whoever you are. The server Jessica was a pleasure and seemed to guess right that I was on a date, so she acted accordingly which was a nice touch...you know, adding a little more formality and checking in frequently with suggestions to the wine and drink list. She suggested the green thing and freaky squirrel for cocktails and they were both very good. We had the pork belly appetizer which was very tender and complimented the large bread basket well. We skipped getting a salad which was good idea because the entrees were surprisingly large cuts of meat. I had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which was exceptional. I suggest when the server asks you how you want it cooked, to just let the chef decide at a place like this. It was perfect. The other entree was the double pork chops still on the bone and it was beyond tender and flavorful. Easily the best pork chop I've tasted and my date couldn't finish it all if that gives you an idea on the portion. Both were served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was cooked properly but the mashed potatoes could probably have used some cream in them, not bad but i'm picky on simple sides like that. The biggest thumbs up I can give is that the steak arrived hot. If you get steaks/cuts of meat at restaurants, you know this to be one of the most anticipated moments and i'm usually very disappointed, but not this time. The food was promptly brought and it makes a difference. The biggest let down of the meal was the dessert, We ordered the doughnuts and they were more like flavorless hush puppies. A bit too dense and overcooked, these doughnuts just didn't do it for me but my date seemed to enjoy them. The desserts at other people's tables looked really good and the remorse of not getting the peanut butter infused treat also probably played a part in my not loving the doughnuts. The price is pretty much on par with any upscale steak place, while some people might not understand that given the location is an older house setting, you have to embrace that you're paying for the peace of mind that you're not in a cheesy setting and you're still getting 4-5 star service and food. That's a big deal if you're a foodie or appreciate what matters in my opinion. That being said, If you're showing up for dinner and you plan on having a few drinks, you should probably be prepared to spend around $130 or so. Pretty reasonable considering your only other option in the area is cafe boa for something similar. Again, props to the server, Jessica- she was really helpful and fun. I considered a 5 star review, but decided to hold off until another visit to confirm how much i enjoyed dinner.

Fuego Bistro has a lot going for it. The servers are attentive, the menu includes a little something for everyone and they have a large drink list. If you do order the mojito, you might want to ask for a double as I couldn't taste any alcohol (a common problem i find with these places that charge 9 dollars for a drink)  The short ribs were 7/10. The mashed potatoes were 9/10. Creamed Corn was 6/10.  Pork Asado dish was 7/10.

The food is always phenomenal  and the service doesn't miss a beat. While some might find the enviroment a little loud and dark, I think it makes it less stuffy and more accessible to a not over-the-hill crowd.   get there a little early ahead of your reservation time- lots of scottsdale bimbos trying to cut in line.

The best pho ga ive had. they cook their broth something insane like 24 hours and you can tell. the service is super friendly and you can tell the family owned store has a passion for vietnamese cuisine. the bakery beside is a good place for dessert after, too.

What happened to this place? The employees are still really nice but the prices have doubled. 7.25 for a dirty chai?? Even local boutique coffee shops don't charge this and for the quality that comes at Dutch Bros' out of the plastic jug chai and just above average coffee- this makes no sense.  They're fast, which seems to be the only factor involved in having to go here. If you have time, you might as well explore your options in the other places around the area and get a really good cup of expensive coffee elsewhere.

My stylist Jennifer gives the best men's haircuts I've found in the valley. She will discuss your needs and concerns before starting to make sure you get the hair you want and looks best for you. It is always nice to have feedback from someone you can trust. Dylan's location is very inviting and has a great aesthetic for men- nothing bright or weird caesar's palace looking decor like a lot of salons. Guys will feel comfortable here.  Tip- book your cuts around a time when you can take advantage of the local hot spot. You got postino and la grande orange within walking distance.

I made a yelp account just so I could review Carmel's. Yes, that's how good my breakfast was this morning. I got the bacon and egg croissant sandwich. The croissant was perfectly flakey and buttery, the eggs over easy were full of flavor and the bacon was cooked exactly the way bacon should be, not overly or under. Carmel's uses  the high quality bacon if you're a bacon snob like me. The sandwich is surprisingly large and is enough to fill a hungry man.The picky eater I was with had the crepes and she was beyond satisfied, I stole a bite and it was delicious. I took two blueberry scones home for my roommates because they looked so fresh- They were gone in about 30 seconds of arriving home and said they were the best pastries they've had. I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was above any expectations I could have hoped for and the interior was very comfortable and warm. (Love the bar setup if you're alone). The owner Pat was helpful and friendly. The person beside us ordered the traditional breakfast with sunny side up eggs and it looked great. Everyone seemed very content with their meals. WIll be back soon and highly recommend. I think this is a very good if not better alternative to the other great breakfast spots in the area, and that is saying something.

Crescent Ballroom is a huge success for downtown Phoenix. The setup is surely to be copied (hopefully) by other Arizona venues. The bar makes real cocktails and is affordable. The mexican street-style food is delicious and decent quantities. The venue looks nice where it counts and keeps it minimal for a good show room. The size of the entire venue keeps things intimate but has enough room not to be unrealistic like a lot of places in downtown, phx. The sound from the few shows I have been to have all been well done.

This place has gone downhill, quickly. Avoid. Search other places in walking distance instead.  Problems: The clientele. The decor. The lights are left on at night. The drinks aren't made well. Shotty service.  Pros: They have TV's.

The delivery is very slow. Don't be surprised after 7 PM to wait 2 hours for your food to show up. (I live 1 mile away) For the wait, the quality isn't impressive. The shrimp are never cleaned properly, so avoid if you can. Anything with the lobster sauce is un-edible. Your best bet is the chow-fun or the fried rice. Anything breaded is usually a bad bet as the food sits over an hour waiting to be delivered. The vegetables are usually overcooked as well because of the assumed time it sits being over steamed en route to your door. My biggest complaint? They never have chopsticks.
