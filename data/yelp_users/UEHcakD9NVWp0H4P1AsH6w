I almost did not go to this location because of all the reviews but I had a friend who swore by this place and said only people who have horrible things to say post. AND SHE MUST BE RIGHT, because this place is AMAZING!!!! They were honest and the customer service by Mike was amazing.  They knew I was on a budget and could not fix everything at once and they helped me figure out the important things and then set up a timeline to come back and fix the rest.  I would tell anyone I know to go here for sure!!!

I just went in there to get lunch to go for my kids and I. The girl at the register seemed really annoyed that we did not know what we wanted right away. I explained that it was our first time and we had never seen a menu. The menu on the wall was written sooooooooo tiny we could barely read it.  I don't like it when people seem annoyed that I am there. You are at your work and you should want people to come in. But they were not happy.   The food was not good. The shells for the tacos tasted like box store bought shells. The meat had barely any flavor. On top of that the salsa tasted like someone opened a can of crushed tomatoes and called it salsa. We will not be back.

If it wasn't for the service I received from my server I would give this place 5 stars. The busboy on the other hand was phenomenal I gave him the tip.   But I will be back the food was sooooo yummy. I had the scallop tacos and my daughter had the salmon wrap. So good!!!!!!! My other two had the popcorn chicken on the kids menu it tasted like frozen chicken and fries. But that's expected it's a fish place.
