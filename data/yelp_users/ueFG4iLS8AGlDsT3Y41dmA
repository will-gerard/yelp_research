The best breakfast I've had, hands down.  The interior is a little bit Balthazar in Soho, the service fantastic and the food delicious and inventive.    Bread came out warm with soft enough butter (pet peeve is butter that is too cold and you can't spread it nicely on your bread until it warms to room temperature!).  Our mimosas held us over nicely while waiting anxiously for our food.  I had a hard time deciding between the Croque Madame and the Scallop Gratin.  I finally chose the Scallop Gratin as it was a special and I'm sure i wouldn't order it ordinarily.  The dish was supremely creamy with the most tender and perfectly cooked scallops.  Leeks were a nice addition to the seafood flavor as well as the perfect amount of thick cut bacon chunks, not too much to overtake the flavor, but just enough to cut the rich creamy sauce.    Tobin's Chicken and Waffles were better than my entree, i have to say.  The waffles were cooked to a outside crunch, with inner softness.  Cooked inside the waffle were bacon pieces and green onion.   Pepper butter accompanied the waffles as well as syrup.  The chicken was a half chicken served with a tasty gravy of bacon deliciousness.  The combination of sweet and savory was amazing and just kept getting better as the meal wore on.  Service was impeccable and perfectly timely.  Our waiter was friendly, and informative with great descriptions and recommendations.

Great, real and fresh breakfast in a super cute teeny tiny spot.  The space is so small that they don't even have a bathroom and could probably only serve 20-25 people at a time.  We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning, but i would assume the wait could get scary on the weekends.  The food was totally spot on.  From the thick sliced perfectly baked bread they use for toast to the honey lemonade, all the small details take this spot to another level.  I ordered the special scramble which was ham, fresh jalapeno and cheese with a side of hash browns.  Tobin ordered the Hog and Chick (pork chop with eggs) and a side of bacon.  While the entire meal hit the spot, the hash browns were the highlight with a perfect balance of crispy top browned bits to the soft buttery layer underneath. The bacon was also legit, perfectly thick cut and cooked to perfect chewy goodness.  The staff was very friendly, quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out.    This place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be.

We walked in for an appetizer dinner in the bar area and only had to hover for a spot for a few minutes.  The place was fairly busy with the usual Saturday night crowd.  Some conventioneers, some groups of chicks and guys, you know, the norm....  I think i was kind of buzzed after cruising around with my yardarita all day, so i can't remember everything we ordered.  My favorite was the thinly sliced strips of meat perfectly marinated and brought to the table raw.  Accompanying the raw meat was a super hot rock that you cooked the pieces on yourself.  De-lish!    Granted, for the long night and many drinks we had and were about to have, we probably should've eaten more and had a real dinner instead of small plates, but ce la vie!

Great value for the money at approx $300/night for a large suite.  I've stayed twice and both times scored a room on the 33rd floor overlooking the Wynn golf course.  I've stayed at the Venetian, TheHotel, Hard Rock, new tower at Caesars, and many others and being at a brand new hotel actually worth the money was a nice change.  While i love TheHotel, the prices are getting out of control, and i feel that the Palazzo room can compete.  There are 3 TVs in the room, a small flat screen in the bathroom, and two in the suite, the first facing the sleeping area and the second in the lower lounge area.  The sitting area is the most impressive with a large L-shaped couch with enough space to seat at least 6 and a nicely sized dining table with 4 chairs.  In the corner is a small desk and chair.  The hotel itself has great restaurants and is attached to the Venetian for even more variety.  The Palazzo shops continue to expand upon the introduction of the first and only Barney's in Las Vegas.   The only downside to this property is that I couldn't determine if it had it's own pool.  We walked to the Venetian pool, which was quite a trek through the maze of the Canyon Ranch Spa.  I'm staying again in September and for any other last minute trips, i'll be sure to try this first.  I sure hope the rates don't get jacked!

A group of about 15 of us had an early dinner reservation during the week of MAGIC and were fairly disappointed.  Let's start with the bad and then onto the good.  Bad:  bitchy service in the bar area as we waited for our party, slow service at our table in taking our orders, over an hour to get our meals delivered, two entrees sent back and most parties disappointed in the taste of their food.    Good:  a few servers were friendly and space is kind of cool in decor as it is a modern hunting lodge theme that we see in LA quite often (7 Grand).  Bottom line is the prices are outrageous for average steak house food.  The menu reads somewhat inventive with flavorful combinations, however the execution is dismal.

4 stars for Scottsdale, maybe 3.5 for LA.    Another key comment, this is not a Gastropub.  Not sure who initially qualified this restaurant as such, but my definition of a Gastropub is a location which serves gourmet-ish, comfort, casual, beer-friendly food with an extensive selection of craft beers and select liquors in a Euro-type setting..  This beer list is comprised of 3-4 beers and not sure any of them are on tap.  Also, there is really nothing "pub" about the layout of this restaurant.   The central kitchen design won me over with the open-flame grill surrounded by bar seating in full view and participation of the women-only chefs creating fresh, simple yet uber-flavorful, seasonal dishes.    We walked in around 9ish on a Saturday night to have our pick of "counter" seating.  The kitchen is literally the size of a small bar area with an open flame grill, salamander and a couple of burners on the back side. I can't imagine how the chefs can operate in this space, but i suppose that prep work is the key.  The menu is small (again, small kitchen) and based mostly on small plates and about 3-4 main dishes.  We ordered the shishito peppers with tahini and black sesame, the beet, watermelon and feta salad, corn on the cob with parmesan and mint and the pasta and pancetta dish along with the indian-inspired halibut with yogurt, basmati rice and cucumber.  The wine list is strictly Arizona wines, which I honestly didn't even know Arizona could produce wines.    So, the low down....  I can honestly say i don't like beets.  It annoys me that i don't, and so every once in a while i try something with beets just  to make sure that I'm not missing out.  The beet-watermelon salad was delicious.  I can't say that i now love beets, but i can say that the balance between the earthiness of the beets and freshness of the watermelon and creaminess of the feta made the dish the best beet dish I've ever had.  It was also complete with some crunchy curry-garlic-herb bits that were charred in the oven.  Ok, now i'm scared since i just wrote a novel about a dish that i usually don't like. Shishito peppers.... unreal.  Tobin downed about 15 of them in 2 minutes.  They were placed on a base of tahini and sesame oil and were charred to still green perfection.  We scooped up every last pepper and wanted more.  Corn on the cob with parmesan and mint, i would have never guessed that those ingredients would work, but they did and I'm excited for Tobin to replicate at home.  And now the slight disappointment came from the main dishes.  The pasta dish was talked up by our host and it was really just another tasty pasta dish.  Pasta was cooked nicely, tomato flavor was good but i didn't taste the richness that was expected from the pancetta.  The Halibut was nice, but maybe too delicate in contrast to our starters.  Now my one complaint... I was served a nice Syrah blend at first and as i finished my first glass with the starters, was not offered another glass (while of course, Tobin was brought a nice Sangiovese blend after his  sub-par first glass of Syrah).  Instead, the server, picked up my glass and no one was at our table to check in until after we had finished our mains.  The servers and staff seemed to be very occupied with a fellow (cute girl) foodie/critic/industry insider sitting next to us, and we got an unfortunate cold shoulder.  That's what always makes me sad about service, I can usually over-order on wine and other beverages, but somehow they don't see that and lose out on additional sales.  I guess it's always a blessing for me seeing as I save a hangover the next morning and have a few extra bucks in my bank account.  Overall, i would recommend this place for anyone visiting Scottsdale and wants a quality, non-cheesy dinner atmosphere.  I would return next time i visit and hope to try more satisfying dishes and hopefully more than one glass of wine.
