Went to Bobby C's last night and had a pretty good time.  Its a little hard to find when traveling down Washington, but I think that makes it a little bit more awesome.  The place is kinda small and quaint and has some cool little tables to sit at...pretty much what I thought of seeing at a place that is supposed to have decent southern food.  Apparently they have live music that plays every now and then, so I'm likely to go back for that.  The staff is great and the food is just about as I had imagined - awesome.  I didn't grow up in the south, but when I get a chance to eat some authentic southern food, I am all about it.  My friend mentioned (she swears she wasn't complaining) that the po-boy was served with the wrong bread, but I thought it looked pretty good.  I had some chicken fried stead, green beans, mashed potatoes, and some sweet corn bread - definitely an awesome meal!  I will be recommending this to anyone that asks me for any southern food restaurants in the future. :-)

Love this place, however, for a few years after it opened, I wouldn't go there simply because it looked crappy from the outside.  Turns out...I shouldn't judge a book by its cover!  The kids love the hot dogs, and I love the gyros!  I go there at least once a week now for lunch or dinner - seriously.  The service is fast and friendly...and the price is just right!

I never used to like Chipotle - pretty much the same way I never used to like gyro's, but now I can't get enough!  I don't go for the overstuffed burritos - the cleaner and easier to eat burrito bowl is the way to go.  I always get double steak, rice, pinto beans, and the medium tomatillo salsa - best...combo...ever!  I guess I should branch out and try new things on the menu, but I ALWAYS order the same thing from every place I frequent.  Ok - next time I'll try something other than the chicken - since it's super bland.  The staff are always super helpful - even got a little tip from the cashier once.  If the line is long (as it always is), just step outside, place a phone order, then hop around the line to go pick up your called in order, because she said they make it nearly immediately. ahahah  I've made an order with my iPhone twice now, and it couldn't be easier.  The only reason this place got 4 stars was because even though the steak is awesome most of the time, from time to time it's kinda tough - it could be that much better if the meat was a little bit better quality.  Also - the chicken is always dry and lacks flavor.

I've been searching for a great mexican restaurant close to my office in old town that serves really good salsa for about 3 months now - finally found the place on Friday last week after I got over my brain-fart and decided to use Yelp! LOL  When you sit down and get your drink order, you get 2 flavors.  I only tried the regular salsa, as I knew I wasn't going to be too keen on the chili powder based salsa - never have been, it might have been fantastic, I just don't like chili/cayenne pepper based salsas.  The salsa I did try was fantastic, but it would of been nicer if we had little bowls to pour it in to instead of having to pour it on to plates.  I ordered up the #1 combination (I think it was #1).  Basically, it was a cheese enchilada, a beef taco, and a beef tamale (with rice and beans).  I had actually made a comment during my meal that the rice was the best rice I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant...no joke!  I'll definitely be going back over there many times over since I work within walking distance!

Can't believe I haven't written a review for Kyoto - I used to go to this place at least 3 times a week when I worked in Old Town Scottsdale.  I've only been there for lunch, and you can't get a better deal.  I would order the #3 lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki & Rice - for $3.50.  Yeah, you read that right...$3.50.  You get chicken, rice, salad, & a few orange wedges - perfect portion for lunch, and it's almost cheaper than bringing your own lunch to work!  The only downside to this place is that if you get there a little after noon for lunch, the service slows WAY down.  I once waited nearly an hour for my food when other times it was out in as little as 10 minutes.  I know places get busy, but they are always busy for lunch, so I'm not sure why they haven't figured that out yet.  They have other items on their lunch menu which includes some sushi, pork, and of couse some more chicken variations.  HIGHLY recommended if you are in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch!

They get 2 stars because the food was actually good, but good lord...can we get some service...or at least have the waitress that is RUNNING all the other tables out side to serve us???  This was the first time in my life that I had ever stiffed a waitress on a tip...seriously.  It was "cute" the first time we waited 15 mins for her to come back to our table and give me a root-beer instead of a diet coke, but it wasn't so cute when we waited 30 mins for her to come back and give us the check after that.  My friend and I had to ask other servers if they could assist us because the server assigned to us apparently just had completely forgotten about us.  Oh well...you live...you learn.  Good food, but the service was awful.  My friend that suggested the place has only good things to say, so maybe it was an off day.  I mean, it was a little busy because ASU was playing on TV, but the waitress handing every other table on the back patio was keepin' up and all her tables were taken care of...our server just had our table...  Meh...

Love this place!  My buddy and I found this place one night when driving around looking for places to eat.  I'm not really in to cheesesteaks, but this place is full of awesome.  I've never tried it, but you can also get an authentic (so I'm told) cheesesteak with "wiz" on it - no, no one is peeing on it...it's Cheese Wiz... LOL  The place gets a little loud because it's all tile flooring, but the cheesesteaks are better than any other cheesesteak place I've been to in the valley.

Amazing...absolutely amazing. Just had a regular ol' pepperoni pizza, but sometimes restaurants can mess up the simplest of pizza's, and I wasn't feeling too adventurous since this was my first time at the Parlor, however, judging by how good that pizza was, I can only imagine the others are just as amazing.  I even came back to my office and I think I told about 10 people about how amazing it was - I hope they take my advice and stop by soon!

Love this place. Actually, today was awesome, because they usually only offer the "express dozen" through the drive thru, and the kids didn't want to go in, so the dude behind the speaker actually fulfilled my order as I wanted.  The only thing that bugs the hell out of me is that they charge for 2 donuts when you get a long john. :-(

Awesome place to go and unwind on a Friday night after a long week.  The new owners just recently re-did the place (actually within the last few months).  They removed the wall separating the dining area and bar, and put up a bunch of new flat screen TV's.  For a "sports bar" style place, this place definitely has some better food.  The prices are a bit on the higher side, but they definitely are worth it for what you get.  My favorite dish is the cheese tortellini in white sauce...so GOOD!  Their pizzas are awesome too.  Great service by all waiters/bartenders...been going to this place for a long time and have never had an issue.
