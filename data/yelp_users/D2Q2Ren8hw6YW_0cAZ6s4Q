I am sure there are virtually no negative reviews of the garden. It is a great place to spend a few hours. It will both delight the visual senses and add a few things to your knowledge base. The staff can answer almost any question you may have and will also add some very interesting facts about the many, many unusual plants that abound. I did not visit at night, when the place is lit up from the top of the mountain to the base. That would be a whole different adventure. Cannot go wrong with the garden.

Good place to spend a rainy afternoon. Ordered the appetizer Nachos with spicy chicken, it was a huge portion. Finished about 1/4 of it and the rest was snacks for later. The clam chowder soup was also a hit.  Simple, good service, good atmosphere, good food, reasonable price, what can be better.

First time to the track. It was fun, fun, fun. Learned a bit about how to read a form and place a bet.....even won one race. I was surprised how reasonable this adventure was. A $5 entry fee to the Turf Club on weekends, free when open weekdays (seniors). Food is reasonable and  better than average. Once in, you can wander around, go the the Finish Line, the paddock, watch the people. I sat at a window table, with a TV to watch the races as they occurred, if that is how you want to look at the races. Did that for awhile, then wandered.  Eight races and if you want to bet you can for $2 and maybe win a few. The  grounds are a bit worn but that is OK, they are clean, the services are good. Lots of interesting people to look at. An enjoyable afternoon, I will go back again.

DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT have Lowes do ANY installation. I went with Lowes because of their reputation. What a mistake that was. They farmed out the installation to a low grade contractor and when that contractor made a MAJOR mistake, Lowes did nothing but push me off to deal with their contractor's insurance company.Lowes took NO responsibility at all. They talk about trusting them with taking care of the customers needs and how they will do the right thing. Well, guess what, it is all false, a deception, could not be further from the truth, they suck you in and then when a mistake is made they absolve themselves of any blame or responsibility. They give it to their legal department, who are as vacant as a Detroit apartment building, they more of less tell you to go away and deal with someone else and you are left on your own to deal with the representative of Lowes who caused the damage.  Thanks Lowes, thanks for standing up for what you advertise, thanks for watching out for loyal customers, thanks for selling out, thanks for being the opposite of what you say you are.....thanks for nothing.

Only 5 stars, if I could give Dr. Shick 12 stars, it would still not be enough. She did a fantastic job diagnosing and treating my best buddy. My King Charles Spaniel was starting to have an ugly skin condition (that had me worried reading articles), I made an appointment with Dr. Shick. She evaluated, gave me the possible conditions, took a biopsy and we waited. Once the results were in, she prescribed a course of medication and within a few weeks, Ollie was getting his healthy skin back. This is the GO TO place for your pets skin problems. Caring, smart and with answers to issues, what more can you ask.

What a great place, they have just about everything Italian when it comes to food. You can even buy a ball of just made pizza dough. They even have Lupini, if you know what that is, you are Italian. Fun just walking around the place and looking at all the stuff they have. Then there is the deli. While waiting for my pizza I stood and watched the items coming out of the kitchen. I wanted to take a bite from each of them. Everything looked just great. Got a pizza to go, the only problem was that traffic was heavy and it took me 40 minutes to get home.  I wanted to grab a slice from the box while driving but I just could not manage it as the slices were quite big and I think it would have ended up in my lap rather than my mouth. Even though it was a bit cold it was still quite good, great crust, nice sauce, cheese could have been spread a bit rather than just big slices placed on top. A bit light on the mushrooms, tasty pepperoni, but all and all a pizza I would return for. I only wish it was closer, if it was, I would be there several times a week.

I hate that my last few reviews have been negative. I am usually pretty good at picking spots that turn out to be good. That said, Palermos Pizza is probably some of the worst I have ever had. I got the two slice and drink special. Just got regular old pepperoni slices. Well, I have had letters from my credit card company that were thicker than this pizza. The dough was pasty, not cooked enough, sauce was barely there, the chesse while there was dripping with grease as was the pepperoni. Even the diet Coke tasted like chlorine. Didn't know how to eat this mess, tried a knife and fork, but everything just slide off to one side, tried folding it, but as soon as I lifted it off the plate it sagged and started to loose cheese and stuff. Finally, used the fork to cut down, which squashed the slice even flatter. I loaded it up with Parm, peppers and oregano, but still there was little taste. I left most of it. Checked the other reviews and some seem to love the place, they must have gone on a day when there was a different cook. Sorry, but I will NEVER go there again.  That letter from my credit card company, with a bit of cheese would probably taste about the same, maybe better if the stamp was tasty.

Great golf shop. Super prices, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Just about anything you would want for your golf game in a friendly, not pushy atmosphere. Nice return policy for clubs and stuff, just in case what you purchased turns out to be not for you. Opens at 8 am. Wonderful mix of new and used clubs at good prices. Not much, if anything, negative to say about Van's.

What can I say.....probably the BEST Mexican food I have had in years ! I had the Enchilada Suizas and it knocked my socks off. The first bite was heaven. The portion was just right and every forkful was a treat. The restaurant itself is mostly white with artist paintings hanging from the wall, but the outside is colorfully painted and a treat all by itself. The wait staff is great, friendly, cheerful and seem to be having a great time waiting/assisting the eager customers.  Looking around at what the other patrons were having made one want to stay and try a great number of dishes, everything looked like you wanted to go over and say, "Excuse me, can I have a bite of that ?". And there was no waiting for food, although the place as about 3/4 full, the order arrived within 10 minutes, barely enough time to sip a Margarita. So, as you can tell, I loved the place, and will return.

Very disappointed, on the bottom of the Mexican food barrel. Ordered the Nachos with chicken. Got a plate of chips with a small mount of a weird melted white cheese on one side and a scoop of sour cream on the other. Beneath this was a scoop or two of black beans (straight from a can) with a good amount of oil. Some chunks of chicken, a few peppers. Not very pretty or appetizing. Had to eat most of it with fork and could not eat the bottom 1/4 of it as it was a mess of oil, runny cheese and soggy chips. Not much love put into this dish. My son had a couple of tacos, fish and chicken and his response was ".......not good". Looks like the place does pretty well as there were a number of customers outside with us, but from the conversation it appeared that most were first timers also. As far as I am concerned, I was a first timer and a last timer. With the amount of Mexican style place in town, this is one that can be avoided, Also seemed a bit over priced, Nachos, 2 tacos and 2 margaritas came to almost $50. I know its Scottsdale but........

Coffee is usually good, today they had to finish brewing the decaf. I waited and what did I end up with, a cup full of coffee grounds. Had to spit out most of the cup of coffee.Guess I need to bring my own filter when I visit this Starbucks.  Very disappointed.

A fun place to dine with friends. Our chef Allen was loads of fun, even though there seems to be a standard of stunts the chefs do, he was entertaining. While he had good skills, the diners did not, we went 0 for 6 in being able to catch foods in our mouth when tossed by the chef.  The floor sweepers probably loved us.  Food was very good and plenty of it and Allen did a great job of preparing.

A passable Chinese place, decor was nice and typical of your Chinese restaurant. Went on a Friday night and there were few patrons there although they seemed to be doing a good take away service. Ordered the Chicken Lo Mein, but want some vegetables with it, so I asked if I could have the Chop Suey (as it came with vegetables) only with noodles ?  Answer was..."no chop suey vegetables, add vegetables to Lo Mein, two dollars more", so, rather than have a language based dispute, I said, sure go ahead, I will pay the extra two bucks.  The dish was good, not great, but was a bit watery. It did have a good amount and variety of vegetables and the portion was adequate. It did need some spice so I asked for some hot mustard and was given it in packets.  Thus far Beijing Garden is in the Good category, but I am still looking for other Chinese places that have food that I can rave about.

Ah, finally a place I can write a good review about.  Saturday night and the place is packed. Lucky I made a reservation, others had to wait 20-30 minutes as there were private parties, families couples and groups of folks everywhere...and the place is pretty big. Plenty of staff to serve everyone and we were quickly seated. Ordered the house salad and a couple of personal sized pizzas. The salad arrived quickly and one small took care of two of us. There was one guy tossing the pizza dough and he was putting on quite a show, although not sure I would want the pizza where he ran the dough across his back, that shirt was a bit sweaty. But, he was talented  that is for sure. Pizza arrived and it was very good, New York style  thin crust. Cheese was fresh and excellent, good sauce, crust while the bottom was crisp and the edges done well, there was still a thin layer of soggy between the toppings and the bottom. Maybe that is just the way a brick oven cooks. Overall a superior product that will bring me back again.

Flemings has a great Happy Hour. The wine is good, the burgers are great and the prices are reasonable. But, it is packed. Get there by 5pm if you want to sit down. Have not been there for dinner yet,  I am sure it is very good as it does look like a lot of high end steakhouses I have been to in the past. But, for now, I will give it a 4+ star for Happy Hour.

Three of us went there for dinner. Nothing special, kind of fast food Mexican style. Later one had a very bad upset stomach, the other two (including me) did not feel real good either.  No more Filbertos, no more

Nice quiet Thai place. Good food, near authentic, but with some Americanization as most Thai food places must do to suit American taste. Good service, adequate portions and tasty  food. Could be a bit more spicy, but I always ask for some spice and they give me a small plate of it to sprinkle on. The times I have been there (5), it has been fairly crowded but did not have to wait to be seated and wait times for food were certainly acceptable. Solid place that I visit when I want some Panang Curry. I will continue to look for quality Thai places, but thus far, Thai Orchid is near the top of the charts for my section of Arizona.

First, the positives, from a business standpoint, on a Friday night, the place was packed with a 25 minute wait time. The service was good and food was brought to the table quickly. and the wait staff was friendly,OK, done with the positives. Now, on the the others. The place is extremely noisy, all solid surfaces and sound just bounces off of everything. Then the food. Hard to mess up a simple salad,  so that was OK. I am not sure why this place calls itself Italian, must be a different kind of Italian cooking than I grew up with. I ordered vegetarian pasta with the Diablo (spicy) tomato sauce. My son the linguine with the same sauce. Both of the pastas  tasted like fiberboard, with one over cooked and the other under cooked, not al dente, just under cooked. The sauce was like a can of crushed tomatoes with some unfamiliar tasting hot peppers added. Could not taste any other herbs or spices, like basil, oregano, bay leaves. Just bland with a bit of heat. NOT Italian at all. Neither of us finished the plate. Didn't work at all for me, but apparently the American palate loves it as witnessed by the crowd. To me it was like an upscale can of Chef Boyarde, upscale in presentation, not in taste. I will never go back.

Love it, been there twice in 10 days. You leave full but it is a good full. Great meat Gyro with salad, plus a drink and soup, for about $7, hard to beat that. Not much for decor, but service is quick and the place is clean. Sometimes busy but seems like they have a steady business with clientele that know they are getting great food at a great price. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you, help yourself to soda and soup. I will keep going back.

UGH......Just ate at this place and I feel sick. Heard it had changed and had good food, so I though I would give it a chance. Ordered the special, 4 pieces of chicken, fries and a biscuit. The fries were all that was edible. The chicken was in the form of a large fried piece of breaded (hard) something. The breading was not good, I removed what I could and did find some chicken, but it was as dry and tasteless as can be. I made it through almost  2 of the 4 pieces. The biscuit was a round, limp, funny tasting piece of pastry, 2 bites was all I could take. I ate all the fries. Absolutely horrible food. I would not eat this again if I was starving, dreadful and now my stomach is upset. Might be time for a purge, even though there was no binge.

A solid "good" on the pizza scale. Was looking for a quick pizza and soda. The server recommended the personal pizza and I accepted. Added some pepperoni, olives, green pepper and sausage for good measure.  Served promptly, looked appetizing and found it to be good to very good, although a bit undercooked. 9" pizza was just enough for a one person lunch, Individual toppings were distinguishable, crust was nice (although as I mentioned, a bit undercooked). but all in all, a place I will visit again. The pizza and a drink was about $ 9.00, good price for a good quality meal.

What a great movie house, not only are the tickets the same price as other theaters, but you get to pick your seats.  And they are more than seats, it is a seat with a moveable tray to put food or drinks that can be ordered anytime during the movie. You hardly know that there are others around you. The food is good and everyone who works there is very friendly and helpful. And even with all this eating and drinking going on, the place is clean. Great concept and great execution. It is a drive from my place, but for a special time or movie, I will gladly drive to the Studio Movie Grill.

Great place for lunch, good choices, nice setting,friendly service. Had the Pa nang curry chicken and it was very good, although could have been a bit more spicy. But that is a problem with all (most) US Thai restaurants .Prices are excellent, most dishes on the lunch menu are a mere $7.99 which includes soup, a won ton and spring roll. Just right for a lite lunch. I will be back.

Have to give these guys a 5 star rating. My 2012 Honda CRV EXL turned 55k so I thought I would take it in for an inspection. A brake inspection was suppose to take about 45 minutes and cost a few dollars. I arrived at the appointment time, turned over my keys and sat to read my Kindle. About 10 minutes later, the manager/tech comes over and hands me my keys. I ask what is up. He says, you are in good shape, you have another 45-50k on the brakes. Everything else is fine. NO CHARGE.  Surprise, surprise, I know other places could have kept the car, found something to adjust to justify a charge and send me on my way. But Brakes Plus did what a professional facility does, give you the straight scoop, plain and simple. Thanks guys, I will be back when I need service.

This rating is based more on the service than the food. Yesterday I ordered take out. I ordered three dishes. What I got was two dishes and one of them was wrong. I should have checked when I picked up the order, but I am not use to having to check on such things. Arriving home I found the error and called. Part of the excuse was, "you did no pay of three dishes". Yea, that is correct and if I had, I would really be pissed. But, I ordered three and each was specific, what I got was two and one was not what I ordered. I did not want to drive all the way back. The food is OK to good, but with that kind of service (it could be a language problem, but I doubt it) I will certainly not order by phone again. Probably go there so I can see what is coming out and what I am paying for.

The only slightly negative I have is that the restaurant was cold inside, had to move and find a warm spot. Anyway, the food was very good and the portions were more than enough. I had the chicken mien and it was very good, a bit, saucy for me, but that is how it is made. I suppose I could have requested less sauce but I forgot. Different ethnic areas make dishes differently so you have to account for that. My partner had the Pho with beef on the side and she liked it very much. All in all, a favorable review for sure.

Just finished a wonderful take out order of Panang Curry from Thai Gourmet and it was great. An almost perfect dish, much like one would have in Chiang Mai or Bangkok. Could have been a bit more hot and I will request that the next time (which will be soon) I visit either for dine in or take away. If the rest of the menu is as good, then Thai Gourmet is a HIT. If you likeThai food, this is definitely a place you should try.

Fun place for a teppanyaki dinner. Our chef, Joe, kept us all laughing while he cooked our meal. He chatted, shot saki in our mouths, produced a lot of fire (scared one small child) and flirted with the good looking girl in the group, told us about himself and made sure each diner got the food they ordered.   Food was good, everyone enjoyer themselves and it was a diverse crowd at our table. Three of us adults and a family with two kids. Solid place to have a good time.

I had heard that Dutch Bros had good coffee, so I stopped by the local shop on a Thursdays morning. Well, there were 20 cars in the drive up line and about 30 in the walk up line. I decided to wait until another time. Next try was a 2:30 in the afternoon. A smaller line, only 5 cars. A guy in shorts and a t shirt was taking orders from the drive up vehicles and was having fun chatting with the customers. I ordered my 1/2 caf, 1/2 decaf and drove up to the window to pay my $2. Got the cup and was off. The coffee, well, I had heard it was good from several people....they were wrong..it was GREAT.  I would go back more often if the dang place was not so popular and crowded.

My son and I found this place the last day here of his visit. We should have found it on the first day, if we had, we would have been back many times. Great food, great prices. Their specialty is seafood, but I am not a big fan of seafood. The did, however, have a chicken burrito and damn it was great !!! My son had fish tacos and he said they were very good. Our server was friendly and helpful, even gave us some coupons to use on the next visit. A great little place with great food. I will be back for sure.

Dish or Direct TV, they both suck ! You have to overpay for TV service that includes  50% or the channels that you never watch and another 25% that you rarely watch and about 20% that you usually watch. Why can you not just purchase channels that you want, not some silly line up with dozens of shopping channels, dozens of ethnic programming channels, dozens of religious channels, music channels that I personally do not listen to. When will some  company offer a TV package that allows you to pick and choose what you want on your TV. Plus you are paying for advertising with all the shopping channels and others that do nothing but try to sell you something. They pay to be on the air, then the TV company makes us pay to listen to this garbage. And the pricing stinks, so may hidden charges or add on items. I am fed up with these carriers...anyone else ?

What a place, not really golf, but fun golf related activities. The place is packed, must be a  hundred employees, a long line waiting to get in, people having loads of fun. A really, totally crazy idea for a place, but it works (not sure how long it will do so) and everyone seems to love it. You do not have to be a golfer or know anything about the game to have fun, all ages welcome. Also a good place just to watch people being themselves.

Stopped by this morning to see what breakfast was like. Greeted and told about the breakfast tacos. Friendly staff, told them it was my first time there and they offered samples. The samples tasted fine, so I decided to purchase some breakfast tacos and take them home where my son and I could share them. Got some bbq sauce also. Cut each one in half in order to sample all three. Nothing special......until later in the day. Shortly after noon both I and my son experienced stomach and intestinal problems that persisted until late afternoon. Only thing it could have been is those dang breakfast tacos. My son said they tasted strange and he must have been right, maybe under cooked pork or somehow tainted, but no matter, there was something wrong. Not often do I give a place a second chance once they have made me sick, so I will pass on further trips to Rudys. To bad, I was looking for a good bbq place.

A small place and I was the only customer, but the raspberry ice was GREAT. Cannot believe why this place is not busy (across the parking lot at Dutch Bros, the place was jumping). Not much decoration, just a counter, couple of ice coolers and other machines, but the product is wonderful. The man behind the counter was friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy what he was doing and getting me just what I wanted. I will continue to visit, I hope others will so that Hanna's can continue and not go the way of so many other small (but good) businesses.

Joined a couple of months ago, their sign up special looked pretty good..how can you go wrong for $10 a month. The facility is large, clean, with enough fans to keep it from getting smelly. The staff is always friendly, both welcoming you and saying good bye when you leave. The machines are always in good repair, the free weights are plentiful and available. They try to make the place "all" users friendly and I believe they have accomplished this. There is a mix of people the time I am there, which is usually at 2-3 pm. I am sure it gets busy after everyone is finished with their workday. Nothing negative to say about the place...oh yea, they have pizza on the first Monday of each month.....you eat, then have to work it off.

Visited this store once, once to many times. The little round button on my i Phone did not work.   I looked to UTube to see how to fix, I did not have all the tools. I took it to this place. They said it would cost $69 to fix and take about 45 min. to an hour. That was OK with me, I left my phone. I returned an hour later and was told it was not the button. What had happened was the battery was going bad and was swollen thus causing the contacts of the button to not connect. The tech said he replace the battery and would charge me the same $69.  I had changed batteries before, it takes about 5 minutes and cost under $10. But, I said OK, paid and left. 20 minutes later I am called by the shop, asking me to return as they forgot to put back the screws on the bottom of the phone. So,  I have to go all the way back for this. I tell them I am not a happy customer. Next day I call the company, explain what happened. They apologize and say they will have the store call me.  That was a month ago, never heard from them again.  Cannot recommend this store, first they should not have proceeded  with battery replacement without clearing it with me, second this should not cost $69, third they should have replaced the screws, and forth, they should have gotten back to me.  Good bye, no more at this store.

Received a call from the manager. Apparently there was a mix up and he was never notified by his regional office about the complaint. He explained and we had a nice chat, he offered a partial refund (which I did not take), but he did offer. After our talk, I would be willing to give them another try and you probably should also.
