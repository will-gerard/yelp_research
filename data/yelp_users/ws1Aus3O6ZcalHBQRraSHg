I love this place.  The tea selection is great (Black Teas, Green Teas, White Teas) and every tea you can get Hot or Cold.  The food is great ...the menu is simple - sandwiches and salads, but so very good.  The bread is so good - they used to get it from Willow Bread on McDowell Rd just off 7th Ave in Phoenix, but they recently closed down, so she's getting her bread from some other Phoenix bakery, and it's still very good bread.  I've tried a variety of sandwiches and salads and if I've had 6-7 things so far all are excellent.      My only gripe about the place is that just outside the cafe is that fountain where all these little kids are running through and the parents are enjoying all of it a little too much.  I'm sure it's a pedophile's dream, but it's not what I'm looking for when I'm looking to relax at a cafe and have to hear 10-15 kids running thru a fountain screaming.  It's the parents who seem to allow it and bring their kids in their bathing suits ...and while I understand family fun and all that ...it's Tempe Marketplace people, not the community pool.  I find it annoying because you can't sit outside and enjoy some relaxing time and it's not exactly quiet.  It still doesn't stop me from going in and spending some time here on weekends, but like I said, it's my only gripe about the place and it's not Tea Infusions fault.  Fortunately about November thru February isn't "Fountain Weather" so the kids aren't running thru it.  Having said that, I highly recommend this place for the quality of what they serve as well as for the selection.  I've been a tea drinker since I was a little kid and if you like tea, or want to get away from Starbucks or coffee for a bit, check this place out.  It's located across from the Hallmark store, and diagonally across from Barnes and Noble.

This place was great.  Right up my alley as far as places on the nicer end (if I had to categorize establishments - upper end of casual I suppose).  5th and Wine is not loud with music or anything overbearing.  They did have two musicians playing guitars and singing 70's covers and those guys were great.    We first ate some bruschetta for appetizers.  I never knew bruschetta could be all these wonderful different ways.  (Am I sheltered, or was I just used to my moms typical bruschetta with tomatoes and basil).  My favorite bruschetta was with the prosciutto. LOVED IT.  The Bruschetta with the peppercorn-crusted steak was equally as good (but the prosciutto ranks as my favorite because I eat steak more often than I have prosciutto, hence the reason prosciutto gets the edge).  Anyway, the bruschetta alone is reason to go and I will go back just to sit at the bar and have some appetizers.  The other two bruschetta's we had was the Roasted Peppers  and Brie, and the 4th was the Apple and Brie.  ALL 4 were YUM.  The dinner I ended up getting was the Beef Bourguignon (Julia Childs' "Beef, Wine, Bacon, Mushroom Stew" over egg noodles)  Note: Served Friday (after 4pm)  ...this dish was excellent as well.  The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly (our waitress was extremely down to earth and cool).    Prices were fair and just like the guy narrating the YouTube link below said "moderately priced".  That's a fair and true statement and given that the food is very good, factoring in everything (quality of food, service, atmosphere), you get what you pay for but I'm going to give extra credit because this place keeps it real and doesn't try too hard unlike other places.  I highly recommend this place to you.  I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.  I gave it 5 *****'s because I have no reason to give it anything less based on my first and only visit.  Side note: There is another half of the establishment used for private parties and functions that can be reserved/rented out ...or I think our waitress said it could be used for overflow seating provided it's not rented out.  Good to know.  Here's the menu for your reference: http://www.5thandwine.com/food-menu ...and additionally here's a link on YouTube where you can catch a glimpse of the interiors and outside: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ARuiWHn6og

While I don't like to hype places up (because really, how GOOD can any one place be) ...How good can one burger joint be over another, or how good can pizza be over another pizza place (when weighing the ones that are all generally Good in the Public Opinion).  Now the word around town is that The Grind is Sofa_King Great.  I will say about The Grind that when you're up for a Burger, this place hits the spot.  I've been here once before August 2010 (don't remember what burger I had but recall it was good) and the other night I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was as good as it gets.  I was starving and really hadn't eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot, but make no mistake, it was really good and I do enjoy this place for the atmosphere, service, and quality of food.  My friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot.  The sweet potato fries (we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries) and they were good.  As for some other areas to review: The atmosphere is nice.  It's casual and not too dark and not too light inside.  (That's how I like it).  There's multiple flat panel TV's above the bar, so plenty of games on at any given time (That's also how I like it).  The service is fine (although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service.  That's often going to be the case with most casual establishments - so sometimes it's good, and sometimes not to our satisfaction).  Such is Life!  Anyway, back on track here, the Wait staff and Bar staff have been worth the 20% tip both times.  No complaints by me about this place, however I do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here.    Where I will dock 1 star and sort of agree with Kristi D.  She mentioned the large photo of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on the wall (while I sense that Kristi doesn't care for Sheriff Joe, I'm neutral about him), but I agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in The Grind.  I'd much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall - and not photos of Sheriff Joe, Mark Grace (for those who don't know, he's a former baseball player), and the Mayor of Paradise Valley, all holding their burgers.  Who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers.  I think I'd be more ok with having these photos above me, but they are HUGE enlargements and a bit overkill.  And they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause.  Look, I'm all for causes and shit, but I wouldn't spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local "notables" holding a burger.  The whole concept is pretty stupid.  But hey, I'm generally uptight and been doing photography 20+ years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall.   Side Note:  For those who might have previously had "Liked" The Grind on Facebook but no longer have their page as a Like, it's because they apparently had their group page hacked, so they had to start over.  I found this out when I Liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 Like's, and certainly I knew this place was way more popular than that.  When I commented that, they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over. http://www.facebook.com/thegrindarcadia

I recently stopped in here since I was in the area and had heard about this thru a friend who had been here when it first opened.  I am a New Jersey Transplant and so my Pizza expectations for Arizona are what they are - that they will always be compared to the places in the area I grew up in and the places I've frequented in the Summer's along the Boardwalks at the Jersey Shore.    The quality of the pizza was great. Both the dough and sauce were satisfactory for my taste buds. I ordered a medium pizza with veggies on it since I was getting something to go for just myself and to have some left over for the next day.  While I was waiting, I had a slice from under the hot lamp and that was one of the best think crust slices I've had in a while. You won't be disappointed with the quality of pizza here.  The staff was friendly as I talked to them while I was waiting.  The dough is made fresh daily the owner and mentioned you can use it the next day, at the 48 hour mark it won't be as good and the pizza crust will be too chewy.  I've been here twice so far and I'll definitely make this a consistent stop.  While it seems farther from where I live (close to that Tempe Marketplace), and this is on Baseline and Cooper ...it's less than 15 mins away as I timed the drive.  60 to Stapley is ten 10 mins at most, and then just a tad south off the 60 and you're there.  Eventually I need to try their other dishes outside of the pizza menu, but if you're looking for a good pie or to grab a slice, stop in and I'm sure you'll like it.  I read one review below about the person being unhappy with the taste, and I find that hard to believe because the taste was great to me.  Football season is coming up and I will definitely be ordering a couple pizza's on Sunday's to take over to my friends house when we watch NFL and monitor our Fantasy Leagues.

Average Sub. Nothing wrong with the service or staff, or cleanliness of the place ...it was just pretty bland on the inside and the bread, quality of cold cuts, and overall taste was just average. I stopped in during one of those indecisive moments of where should I get food, and with so many places in the overall shopping center (Gilbert Rd off the 202) I ended up trying this place out.  It's not that I wouldn't go again, but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to go out of my way to go back.

This place has sucked for years.  It was a sh!thole 20 years ago in the mid-90's but did the job for a late night slice after you've been at the bars. I haven't had this pizza in years - I have no idea how long - well over 10 years.  My current gripe with them is the constant flyers that used to appear on my gate each week.  They stopped for a while after I bitched to my Property Management that over-flyering was not necessary given that half of them would end up fallen off our front gates and blown around the grounds.  It was like the dorm with all this non-stop flyering. There's 180 units in my condo community ...they were flyering nearly EVERY WEEK, and a lot of the ground level condos have 3 gates (front patio, side patio, and back patio that's on the side of the building), and the idiot flyer guy can't figure out that a side gate, and/or a back gate that doesn't have unit number above it, doesn't need a flyer, but some condos would often get flyers on two gates, and on some rare instances, all three gates had a flyer.  I did a rough estimate about how many flyers they were leaving in my condo community over a year ...it was well over 9,000 flyers a year.  Are you f'ing kidding me Gus' ? Finally the flyering stopped after I endlessly bitched to my HOA, but then the flyers resumed again a few months later.  Eventually, they stopped again about six months later and currently I haven't seen a Gus flyer in months.    Hey Gus', we know where your crappy establishment exists if we need you, but I would NEVER order from this place based on polluting our condo community with weekly flyers ...and secondary to that, the hour+ wait time to get average pizza ...NEVER will I bother ordering from this place. It was a sh!thole in 1996 when I was in college, and it still is 20 years later.  The original location was a dump, but they moved over to the former Geno's cheesesteaks joint arond 2014, so I'm guessing the place is cleaning because that Geno's location was fairly clean and the interiors weren't the dump that Gus' old location was ...but guess what, I still will never order from this Sh!thole. Order from here if you wish, but your best bet is to grab a slice going in ...but don't waste your time waiting on a delivery when you're drunk late night ...just order from somewhere else and save yourself the aggravation.
