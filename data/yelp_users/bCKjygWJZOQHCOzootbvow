I'm not gonna tell you anything that the other reviews haven't already mentioned. True, the "Bobbie" is the marque menu item here, and it's really as good as advertised (if you like a good thanksgiving sandwich.) Other than that, I have not been blown away by the food here, above average sandwiches and the like, just not amazing.  Service has been great here though. Several occasions they have run out of something, and comped or discounted parts of our order. These guys have a mom and pop feel despite being a franchise.

Damnit, damnit, damnit! I wanted to write a good review of this little mom and pop restaurant. On the surface it's got a lot going for it; it's quaint and sufficiently run down enough to make you think it's one of those small gems, it's gotten great reviews In the past, it smells like a good Mexican food place should, and it's been around forever.  Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata. The tortilla was excellent, but the beans were so cold that they didn't melt (or ever warm) the clump if cold cheese inside, leaving me with what is essentially a burrito-cicle. I came in relatively early at 11:10 so I suspect that they just were not really ready for me. The taste wasn't bad, it was just that it was too cold to really enjoy.  As a sidenote, the horchata was so sweet that it was almost undrinkable, and had the taste and consistency of coffee creamer. What a shame.

This is a story about "going the extra mile"...  Which is exactly what I do when I drive an "extra mile" down the road to a different McDonald's location, instead of going to this, closer, more convenient one.  EVERY single time I have gone to this location they have messed something up. Wrong orders, forgotten items, miss-charged credit cards, are just a few of the things that this collection of knuckleheads consistently excels at.   Save yourself some frustration, and go the extra-mile...down the road.

Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.  That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.

See this place before they close it down and move down the street to some polished and soulless location off Scottsdale Road.  It's not necessarily  that this location is  architecturally significant, or unique in any way that couldn't be reproduced, its just that I simply don't trust Harkins to continue their commitment to small films. I see another huge multiplex opened with a few screens initially committed to art and independent films. That is, of course, until they realize that they are losing a precious revenue by not having every possible screen available to show Michael Bay's next gilded turd.  ...let's hope I'm wrong.  Until then, please go check out this theater. They always bring interesting documentaries, art films, and indie stuff.

Tiny, slow, messy, and divey.  That aside, some of the best take out Mexican I've had in town. Just killer street tacos. Great carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua if you go that way. The staff is friendly and playful, always saying things like "you want pico de gallo with that my friend?"   So good that I went back the next day.

Ahh Whole Foods...your greed never ceases to amaze me. I sometimes take the family here for dinner, which, if you've been here, you know is not cheap. Spent close to $60 for the 4 of us to eat from the hot bar and thought I'd grab a bottle of beer to enjoy with my meal. I was told by the bar tender at the "watering hole" that they needed to charge me a dollar "corking fee" to open my bottle so I could drink it there. WTF? I know it's only a dollar, but it feels like insult to injury to add that to the already ultra  premium prices they charge. Not to mention, the previous several times I wasn't charged for the same exact thing...

Wow, I'm really impressed with the value from this little place. $5.25 get you an entree, rice, egg roll, creme cheese wonton, and soup. Food was really good too, loved the Kung pao and orange peel chicken. Much better than panda.

Consider yourself warned, do not take your vehicle here! Had a problem with a vehicle and had it towed to Greulich's. The next morning I got a call from one of the "mechanics" telling me that he could not get into the vehicle because the key wouldn't work. I explained that this was because had had the ignition replaced (by them) a year earlier, and that the door key was different from the ignition, and that we always used the key fob to unlock the doors. He explained that the fob wasn't unlocking the doors, and asked if I could bring down the door keys. I agreed to do so, but suggested that he check the battery first. He agreed to do so, and said he would call if he needed me to come down with the key. Later that day another "mechanic" called me with an estimate of repairs that included a new window actuator (an extra $200+) that needed to be replaced because the window was broken and stuck in the rolled down position. I explained that this was not the case when it was towed in, and that the other mechanic had called because he could not get in to the vehicle, which he would have obviously been able to do if the window was down. To this, the mechanic replied that there must have been a "miscommunication" because the window was down when it had been towed in. I asked him why then had the other mechanic not been able to get into a vehicle with an open window, to which he stammered "uhh, umm, he never actually went out to the vehicle, and umm, never noticed the window was open." I asked him how he knew that the key didn't work if he didn't go out to the vehicle, to which he said that "well....uhh... he did go out, but didn't notice the window was down." I almost fell off my chair, "who do you have working for you?" I asked incredulously. It didn't matter, the mechanic was holding to his story, and I could either pay to fix the window that they OBVIOUSLY broke when trying to get in to the vehicle, or spend a bunch of time arguing and fighting it. I decided to not give them the satisfaction (and extra money)  and had it repaired at another place. I have since complained to AAA and the BBB. Stay away!

I work nearby, so I come here several times per month for lunch. The pizza is really really good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the prices are reasonable. I'm A bit surprised this place is not busier, must be the slow season before the "snowbirds" come back. Check em out if you're in the hood.

$10 per month....no contract!!! Also, the TVs built into the cardio equipment makes "treadmill time" a little more bearable. Not lovin' the purple and neon green scheme they got hapnin, but its worth putting up with to have to get locked into one of those deceptive, heavy handed contracts that fuggup yer credit and haunt your existence.

I've prolly been to every thrift store in town dozens of times, I go almost every day. This is one of my favorites. Whoever is sorting donations here has a "picker's" eye. Great prices and proceeds go to a great cause.   Daily special and small store pricing makes this better than the corporate, overpriced, big guys (Savers & Goodwill I'm looking at you)  But it's the selection that sets it apart. If you are looking for hand selected vintage items at sub antique store prices, and enjoy the hunt,  this is your place.

Back at Christmas I can in to this location during a particularly busy time, and had to wait a while behind a large order. No big deal right? I didn't think so, shiz happens, I'm not gonna get all butt-hurt cuz I hadta wait a few minutes. At any rate, the cashier apologized and have me a little business card with a coupon to come back later and "buy one burrito, get one free"  Fast forward to today, I decide I'm gonna get me a burrito, and stop in at this location. Now, I knew that my coupon had expired, but I thought wth, might as well give it a try. I asked the manager, shift lead, whatever, if I can still use the coup and says "sorry sir (yes...he called me "sir") this has been expired for months" I tell him no problem, and order my food. When I go to pay for my burrito, the guy tells me "you know what, don't worry about it, you got that coupon because we messed up last time, I'm not gonna charge you...AND imunna comp your drink too"  This is why these guys are the best!!! Pay attention you other quick serve joints. It's called customer service, Chipotle nails it!
