I've been to Cherry Blossom twice during a one week period and I am looking forward to going back again to try new things from the menu.  The atmosphere is awesome, the staff is friendly, the happy hour specials are excellent, and most importantly, the food is tasty.  I've been on a search for good sushi since Celsius has closed down but this place gives me some hope.  I recommend the crunchy eel roll.

I went to this store because I heard they have a decent hookah and shisha selection.  Well their selection isn't too bad....  But the prices are down right outrageous.  Next to Trails, this place charges too much for their hookah merchandise.

This is a great, non-chain sushi bar.  Their happy hour is hard to beat and they only make their sushi to order.  The atmosphere and ambiance is that of what I expect from a sushi bar.  My absolute favorite roll is the Vegas Roll with sweet eel sauce and this is one of the rolls that is half off during happy hour.  I believe they are still doing the all day happy hour on Saturday.  I'm craving their sushi and it's only 8:30am.

Great food, great prices, great hookahs, great shisha selection... Nuff said... but really, if you live in Tempe and have a hookah hobby, do yourself a favor and visit this place.  You will be pleasantly surprised by all the hookah gear they carry.  If hookah isn't your thing then come for the food.  Their chicken shawarma sandwich with fries is delicious and affordable.

This place has excellent shawarmas for a low price of $3.99.  I go here almost weekly and they are consistently good.  They have a $10 minimum for debit so bring cash.  Also, the store that they are connected to, Baiz Market, carries hookah supplies.  Phoenix needs more places like this.

The food was OK but the staff were unprofessional. One of the hostesses wore a very tight and low cut dress... For a minute I thought we were at a gentleman's club. The hostess placed our menus on a table on the patio. While we were walking to our table, the manager approached us and said "you have to go through the front entrance," as if we sneaked in. He didn't care that one of us was disabled, with a cane. It took almost 20 minutes for our server to come to take our drink order. Someone from our group asked for no tomato and no onion on her wrap... too bad we couldn't find our server to correct the order because he was MIA. Lastly, the food wasn't flavorful. The shawarma was bland and sauceless. If you are into trendy places with snooty clientele and mediocre food, you will love this place.  I've been to the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale and Tempe and had very pleasant experiences at both.

This place was recommended by 2 friends when it was called Mr. Sushi.  My wife and I met up with another couple here for dinner this week.  When we walked in, the person working the host/hostess booth asked one of the server's to seat us and she responded with attitude.  This pretty much set the tone for the rest of the evening.  1.  Wife's beverage didn't make it out until after 20 minutes of being seated and after 3 requests.  2.  It was hit or miss with some of the rolls we ordered.  The California Roll fell apart when trying to eat it with chop sticks.  The crab mix tasted off.  3.  Server didn't clear the table and we sat with finished plates cluttering our table until we paid our bill.  4.  One of our rolls was forgotten about and was brought out to us when everyone finished their sushi and entrees.  Some positives of Akaihana is that the quantity of sushi was plentiful and the price was very reasonable.  Some of the other staff seemed friendly but unfortunately we drew the short straw.  My wife doesn't want to have anything to do with the place but I'm willing to give it another shot sometime down the road.

Came here around the first few weeks of their grand opening.  I tried the Deja Vu Blueberry...  Tasty indeed!  They used Mya-like hookahs and have very prompt coal service.  My only complaint is that they do not sell food.  Decor is nice and the staff is nice.  If you live in North Phoenix and like hookah come check this place out.

Nana's carries a lot of tobacco related items, but I go there purely for their hookah and shisha selection.  They carry large boxes of Coconara charcoals (coconut coals for hookah...  if you haven't tried these you really need to), plus various flavors by Fantasia, Fusion, Al Fakher, Potion, Hookah Hookah, Hookah Freak, and now Deja Vu.  I have also seen Khalil Mamoon and Magdy Zidan Egyptian hookahs, plus MYA hookahs.  They charge you a little extra for using debit so try to bring cash.  Nana's probably has the best selection out of all the north valley stores that I have been to thus far.

The food here is quite impressive.  They serve a variety of Asian style dishes, not just Chinese (given the name).  The atmosphere is nice on the inside and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Sun Devil Chicken, which was a Vietnamese inspired spicy dish and it was quite tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try out a few more items from the menu.  Give it a shot!

Wow.  Plain and simple.  Wow.  The Eddie Lopez pastrami burger was pure Awesome and the fries they came with were a delight.  Came in because of the yelp reviews.  Our party of nine was pleased.  I recommend the blueberry Maine root soda and the Gale's rootbeer.  I am glad there is a place like this on the west side.  I am looking forward to my next visit.  Cheers to rocket burgers and subs!

Went here last night with a group of friends.  Their selection of salt water taffy and soda is wear it's at.  Their salt water taffy is served in bulk and you can fill your bag to the brim!!  They also carry a large variety of international and rare candy.  The store clerk working there last night was really welcoming and friendly.  I know where I am going when I am on a candy fix!!  I'm so glad I live less than 15 minutes away from this place!!

First time at Vape & Co and I had a great experience.  Tony is the owner and he is super friendly and he runs a chill and clean establishment.  He has an up to date selection of ejuices and devices and the prices were reasonable.   I picked up a JMK white delrin drip tip for my Aeolus and it fits and functions perfectly.   I also picked up a Derringer drip tip and some Kilo, The Mitsu, and Lost Art ejuices.   I am very pleased with my purchases and overall experience and I will be back for sure!

Great products and customer service. Tasters are out of sub ohm tanks which is nice as well. They have a great selection and Jig the shop keeper is friendly.  Would go back again next time I'm in the area!   Picked up Nick's D'ohnuts flavor and Liquid State's Apple Butter!
