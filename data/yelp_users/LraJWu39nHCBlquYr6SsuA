Relatively unknown, but everything there is amazing. Everyone that works there is so friendly too. Try the cinnamon and sugar bagel. Awesome

2 stars go to food. Great food! Girl at front, not so great. No greeting as I came in. She kept her sunglasses on. I proceeded over with caution as I began to consider that she actually could be dead...that is until she reached over to her bag of pistachios and proceeded to crack one open and eat it in front of me. After a sigh of relief, I decided to initiate interaction to get the ball rolling. Told her it was my first time there and didn't know what to get. She responded with, "gyros great" as she continued to munch on her nuts. I decided on the chicken kabob...The restaurant itself, eh, a little uncleanly. Cute little place if they made an effort to wipe the grease from the ceiling and pay attention to people that want to give them money for food. May or may not be back...depends on if girl at front is still busy eating

Looove this place! Especially on Saturday and Sundays. Breakfast is so good. I would suggest breakfast taco plate or build your own burrito. The bottomless bloody mary/mimosa special on the weekends is probably the best deal. They literally never let ur glass get empty. Plus, there is a dj...need I say more? It's hands down the best time I've had at 10am
