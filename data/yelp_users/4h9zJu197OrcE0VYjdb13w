Stopped in for a quick pitstop on a warm Saturday afternoon.  The Club Panini was really good, especially the crispy, fresh foccacia bread.  But the star of the show clearly was the White Sangria.  Lots of lemon, lime, and orange flavor made it perhaps the best we have ever tasted anywhere!

Overpriced, even for an airport ($24 for a glass of Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnay?), inconsistent service (ice-cold fries and dirty wine glasses served up with a smile), and an "iconic" menu that probably will leave you scratching your head (Chilis en Nagoda? Cochinita Pibil? Comida Chingona? Ensalada Tata?).  Seriously, is this the kind of food you want if you only have a 30-minute stopover before getting on a 3-hour flight?  Perhaps if you're feeling lucky and adventurous, but me?  Eek!  Methinks not.
