I have been driving past their pumpkin patch for years and finally went this past October. Three times! The first time, I stopped by to do a price comparison. I needed mini pumpkins for a charity event I was doing. The second time, I went with my family and we enjoyed taking pictures and picked up several pumpkins...I think we spent $10. The third time I bought a bunch of mini pumpkins for that charity event, because at 50 cents each, it was the best price I found. I like it because it's not overly crowded, but they have an array of sizes and shapes of pumpkins. it's neat and orderly and the prices are very good.   The volunteers are very nice and helpful. They have various wagons to help you shop & carry your pumpkins to your car. They also have decorated it very festively and have photo areas set up with hay stacks and cut-out photo spots. You get a pumpkin sticker and color pages as well with your purchase.  For tired parents, who don't want to make a whole day event of pumpkin patch-ing, this is a cozy place to go in & out, and still get that classic pumpkin patch photo you've always wanted.

see this picture posted by another yelper: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=nEEtzmZrXXFr-egtbVSF6A That's the size portion I'm used to from Chino Bandido.  What we got last week was about 3/4 of that.     My husband and I have been ordering the combo of jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and black beans ever since this location opened in Chandler. And have always been satisfied.     I was so shocked at the portion that I asked the employees what happened.  Their explanation is that they "have not downsized the portions, because the portions were being over-sized incorrectly before.   So, now the portions are the right size."  And looking through the other yelper photos, i see one from '08 that looks similar to (but still more than) the portions size we got last weekend.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=kGQgU8IelC8DABJQSdIYoQ  So, oK, well, I can understand what the employee was talking about, but, it still is rather disappointing.   Considering that we've ordered the combo more times than I can count, and have never had the "mini/correct" portion-size ever before until last weekend.   They also used to give my daughter a small cup of rice with a little bit of plain chicken.  this time, when I asked for a little kiddie cup, they gave me the same size cup, but it was empty...  The one thing they give generously still are those big huge sugar cookies.  Unfortunately, we can only ever finish half of those.  I'd rather get a free cup of rice for my daughter, than three big sugar cookies.  If ever we go back, i'll ask if they'll do that for me.  But, we're not likely to come back again even though we like the food, it's just not affordable for our family anymore.  One combo wouldn't even satisfy me as it is now.  For my husband and I, I'd say if we ordered three combo meals, that would be filling.

I have been a fan of The Urban Tea Loft, even before they opened!  Glynis & Eric LeGrand gave us a tour one night for my curious family.  Since then, I've visited several times.  Each time the experience has been just as friendly and enjoyable as that first night.  My husband & I had valentines dinner there and a nice after-run breakfast, too.   It's got a hip upscale ambience, yet you feel very comfortable.  Great place for a date!

On previous visits, I've had decent service and always liked their chicken empanadas, which I still like. And If I happen to be at AZ mills already, then I'd deal with the luke warm service just to order one to munch on while shopping.  So, prior to today, I would have rated them a 3 or 4 star.   Today, I drove out just because my brother had been really craving a good piece of cake. So we trekked it out to Red Ribbon.   Starting with the good.  The eating area was clean.  My almost 2 year old daughter loved playing on the cool orange chairs.    Unfortunately, my brother & I don't recommend going out of your way, like we did, just to come & try Red Ribbon at AZ Mills.  So, Now with the not so good, my brother decided on a red velvet cupcake.  There were three on a tray along with 3 chocolate mint cupcakes and a white cupcake.  The sales lady told him, "Oh that's just for display."  My brother & I exchange glances, because he was just joking about this possibly happening!     The sales lady promptly suggested we buy the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes. My brother didn't like the look of the chocolate cupcakes, plus he only wanted one!  So, he asked for the only other cupcake option, one white cupcake. She told him it was for display also.   I suggested that maybe they should sell the cupcakes individually. She responded that they do that. So, I was thinking OK, so why can't he order that red velvet cupcake? but oh, well, maybe it was old.   Slightly perturbed, but not yet willing to abandon our quest, i ordered the Ube Boba Shake, because they were out of Mango.  While my bro made his final choice, he noticed there was one white cupcake, that was in the tall refrigerator behind the counter.  It was inside a plastic four pack container, along with one chocolate mint cupcake.  The lady said, "Oh, that's just icing from a previous mango cupcake..." My bro asked to see that one anyway.   She seemed to me, to be reluctant as she went to the fridge & got out the pack. And lo and behold, it was not just icing, it was a white cupcake. Odd that she would tell us that it was just icing.   So, my brother asked if he could get that one, specifically pointing to the white cupcake in the pack. The lady again, proceeded to put the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes in a bag...   My brother & looked at each other again. I told her that this was just confusing and that she looked like she was getting stressed out & I apologized for that. But, my bro wanted that one white cupcake. She finally rung us up for that mango cupcake. Relieved to be done with us, she quickly asked the next customer if she could help them, without giving me my Ube Shake. I asked if it was ready?  Without saying anything, she walked away to the back, then came back & told me they're still making it. In my head, I'm thinking, OK....I just don't get the feeling that we are a valued customer.   While waiting for my shake, I tasted the cupcake that was so difficult to get.  I liked the icing, because it was light and not overly sweet.  But the cupcake itself, was nothing special to write about.   My brother also told me he tried their pancit on a previous visit and thought it was, in his words "Blegh!"   I told him how I like their chicken empanadas, but he was no longer interested in trying anymore of their food.   When I finally got my shake shortly after, it was nice & cold and had a thick texture like a shake should have, but really did not taste great. Mainly because the boba had a strange texture to it, like some parts were hard and some semi soft.   Also, to be fair, I'm usually not an ube fan in general. But, even still, I just thought it tasted bland and with a hint of sweetness/ chalkiness. I guess I was hoping for something more exotic with such a bold purple color. I think the price of $3 something after taxes is high for what you get.   I suggest taking two more steps passed Red Ribbon to Gloria Jeans or Haagen Daz if just want a good shake.  And I will save my Boba Shake cravings for Lollicup or AZ Boba Tea House.   So unfortunate that we didn't have a good experience at all.  I really want to support our local Filipino restaurants. Hence, why we went out of our way to get to Red Ribbon.    I feel bad giving them a 1 star, so I'm giving them an extra star...If Red Ribbon can improve on their customer service at least, then I would recommend people  try it.  Because I'm sure they've got to have something good on their menu, it's just we didn't have any luck with what we ordered nor with the service...

**for whatever's it's worth here's my very old, unfinished...Tuck Shop Review:   After several loopy-de-loops and a quick text to Google Find, our little group of three happily found the charming neighborhood Tuck Shop, last night after the Luna Festival.   This is a place where you can go and feel welcomed and familiar. A place where the food is not over-seasoned and the service is friendly and attentive. While the atmosphere, music, low light and cool mini art gallery makes you relaxed...the food service was prompt.   At Tuck Shop, they've embraced the sharing concept, which is what probably excited my companions the most. I am one that normally does not enjoy sharing my food in equal portions...you may have a bite, but the rest is all mine!   Although we did not sit at the bar, we appreciated the detail of purse hooks under the counter. And noted both the casual choice of miscellaneous dining chairs ....   (**please note, this review was started in march of 2009...prior to finding out I was pregnant. Needless to say, I forgot all about this review in progress and now may 2011, it's been so long since I ate here, that I can't even remember what exactly we ate. But, I definitely remember I enjoyed the food, whatever it was! ...loved the vibe of the place and I'd love to venture back to phoenix just to try it again, so that I can give a proper review and see if it can keep it's 4 stars from me.)

Paletas Betty is a nice, clean, hip little local joint that specializes in handcrafted mexican ice pops, made with fresh ingredients in small batches. These are not wimpy pops. Several varieties have chunks of fresh ingredients lodged in their frozen goodness, like the Nuez with chunks of pecans. When you're so stuffed from eating in the nearby restaurants, walk it off down to Paletas Betty, where you can pick a pretty hefty but light & refreshing specialty popsicle. We've treated ourselves three times now and have always completely cleaned off our popsicle sticks.   You can see my full review here - http://tinyurl.com/paletasbetty

Been awhile since we had our carpets cleaned.  Didn't think they were that bad, but wanted them cleaned before new baby arrives. We were pleasantly amazed at the difference.  We didn't have the whole house done, just the high traffic areas, but now you can really see how clean the previously dirty areas are compared to the areas we thought didn't need cleaning.  We will be calling Brian back to do the last room soon!  We'd also like to note Brian's excellent customer service.  He answered all our questions thoroughly.  & when he got to work, he was very efficient in how he went throughout the house.

I have a more detailed review on my blog with pictures. cactusmangokitchen.blogspot.com In short, the prices are affordable, the service is quick & accommodating. I liked the coconut mungo dish, pork lumpia & atchara. They were out of their #5 which had the bbq pork & chicken...would love to try that if ever there is occasion to be in Phoenix...but, I don't think we'd go out of our way, just for Hey Joe's again.   The banana-que was alright for me. I like mine sweeter encrusted with caramelized sugar. Hey Joe's is lightly caramelized. But we did eat four banana-que! It was cold out & the warmth of the banana-que's hit the spot.   I also tried the Adidas/chicken feet. I liked the crispy skin, but just couldn't bring myself to eat the chewy sinews between the tiny bones. The atchara's crunchy, sweet/tangy coldness helped ease the Adidas experience.
