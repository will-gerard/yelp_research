Always understaffed.  I can't tell you how many times I've been there and they have one poor server working on half the tables!

It's an airport.  It sucks sometimes and it sucks less at other times.

This concept is totally idiotic!  After having a bad day, we decided to go with some familiar comfort food.  Upon entering we knew that things were different and there was a nice young woman who was there to explain it all.  I was willing to give this a try, but we found out immediately that it's no longer a buffet.  I've never had to be given a tour with detailed instructions how to order at a restaurant before and still didn't understand.  It was move like we had to *trained* on how to order.  Each person gets a card with a magnetic stripe and you're expected to get it swiped at every station you go to.  A swipe for your salad.  A swipe for your soup.  A swipe for your meat.  Older people and families with lots of kids are really gonna hate this!  Then you pay at some register that's either in the soup section or the salad section.  I'm not sure which.  By that point at was so annoyed and had stopped paying attention and we left.  Admittedly, this review is not about the food, but the complete confusion we felt immediately despite their friendly and patient staff.  This is horrible idea and I hope abandon this test concept soon!
