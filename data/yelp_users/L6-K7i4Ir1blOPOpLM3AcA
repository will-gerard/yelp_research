It really doesn't get any better than this.  The only place I will go - If you want to try yoga or you've been practicing for a while,  you will be glad that you went here.  The staff is great.

I finally had enough!   It all started out great (as most) for me.  Loved the hours and convenience. Then they went to a "PAY FIRST" policy.  Ok, I guess, but what if every service based business did that?  don't you think that is kinda strange? Then things got worse. 1.  Girl at counter.  Real harsh and angry.  probably not the best choice for any business.  I felt as if I was mentally abused by the time I left.  It is OK if you don't have any question relating to your laundry.  Eye contact is out of the question. 2.  THEY decide what will be dry cleaned or laundry.??? 3.  if your buttons are thick, there is a problem 4.  if your shirt doesnt button all the way down, there is a problem 5.  Linen blend?  there is a problem 6.  They iron your shirt from wet to dry.  No dryer.  When was this normal? Great place I guess if you don't expect much and have traditional dress shirts.

Very helpful.  They were able to get my dog in for oral surgery at a moments notice and were very professional.  The place is run better than most doctor's offices.  CLEAN and professional.

Always enjoy eating here.  The Chef makes a good pizza.  If you like the pizza in southern Italy, you will love the pizza here.

I was trying to figure out why there are such different reviews for this place.  I was thinking that the bad reviews were from people who were used to corporate chains and processed foods.  I really got that wrong. If you are expecting Italy or Naples style food, you too will be greatly let down as I was.  I had several texts to warn me when I checked in here for dinner.  I should have listened. Pasta was overcooked.  Floating in a butter sauce, literally.  So much poor quality cheese on everything.  Pizza was like frozen style maybe before it was frozen.  Smothered in greasy cheese on a boring crust. We had 2 dinners and 2 pizzas.  We ate about 1/3 and felt sick from the heavy, cheesy, oily, buttery and greasy food.  I may have to have a cholesterol medication after this.  Even my dinner salad had about a cup of cheese pellets on top of it.  I've not seen mozzarella in this form before.  What is going on here?  Maybe I would have thought this was good when I was in my teens.  I think that this place has a lot going for it, but not it's food.

I've been bringing my pets here for about 17 years and referring others to go here as well.  Over the past couple of years, things have not been going so well with customer service (the guy behind the counter always acts as if he could care less about you or your pet) or cleanliness of the business.  I've also had trouble with them stocking my pet food that they prescribed.  I hate to see any business go downhill, so I am hoping that things turn around here.  Meanwhile, I will be going somewhere else.  PLEASE take pride in your businesses!!

WOW.  I've been once for dinner and was completely disappointed from start to finish.  I couldn't believe the manager was wearing baggy golf shorts and flip flops.  The waiter looked so upset when we didn't want a wine list and whispered something to another waiter and they stared at us as if we were losers.  Food not so good especially the presentation. I live in the area, but would not go back or recommend.

Embarking on my newest journey down the meatless diet road lands me here for dinner.  I was so very hopeful and completely open to my new experience.  Place is nice and clean so I ordered: * spicy buffalo "wings "   * egglessrolls * drunken mushroom chicken The wings made me think of boneless wings at first but I found them oily and slightly mushy.  I could only think of a frozen package of fake chicken that was heated and cut up.  Similar or the same maybe for the fake chicken in the drunken mushroom chicken bowl.  A breaded piece of processed, packaged and frozen fake chicken is all I could think about when eating, so I stopped. The egglessrolls appeared to have also been processed, packaged and frozen then,  deep fried in oil.  I was thinking that they would have been fresh rice paper wrapped.  They were mushy and oily on the inside.  Crispy and oily on the outside. The noodle dish deserved a bigger taste and perhaps a bolder sauce.  The vegetables were cut without care or respect to culinary skills whatsoever, often leaving parts that would have been better off in a stock or trash. I so wish that I would have stayed home and cooked my own meal on this day. I feel like I was at the TGIFridays of vegetarian foods. Thanks for reading!
