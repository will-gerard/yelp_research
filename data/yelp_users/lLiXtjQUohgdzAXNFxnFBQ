Deanna was amazing as usual. Always helpful my packages go overseas so it always takes more time. Thank you Deanna for all your help expecially during this busy time of year.

Went to San Felipes tonight and will never go back! At first we were told we could not sit outside, it would be a 10 minute wait because the waitress needed to catch up. Isn't that why you have a manager?! When we got seated we waited 20 minutes just for a waitress for our drinks and then another 20 minutes just to order food. When we finally got our food it was cold and barely edible. Our waitress then tabbed out with us and handed us over to another waitress who took one order and forgot we were there. After having to go to the front desk and ask for a waitress twice finally went to the bar and asked for our check! We are business owners and would never treat our clients like this. To top it all off the Manager was so busy talking to his friend at the table next to us as he watched us trying to get service, not once did he come over to help us. Even as we sat with our hands raised above our heads just to get someone's attention.Really?! You would think with what little money people have today to go out, you would treat them so that they would want to come back. Find a new staff who actually wants to work!
