My Wheaton is not well and I really needed to get him groomed. I took him in to see Erica. She is so compassionate and gentle! And she did a great job! Reggie loves playing with the other dogs and goes into the crate when he is tired. It's like taking him to a play date. We will be going back!

I was there for the first time for a breakfast meeting. The 4 of us ordered breakfast and talked throughout our meal. Perhaps we were taking too long as our waitress brought our bills (BTW, we were sitting for less than 1 hour at that point). She then proceeded to take my plate and place another one on top of it. Did she ask if I was finished? No, she did not. I still had my fruit and potatoes left.  Since 2 of us lingered a bit longer I left a 20% tip...She did not deserve that much with her terrible service. She then came back to our table and asked us to leave and sit somewhere up front and talk. As it is, when I sit at table that could have turned, I am sure to compensate the server well. never gave us that chance.   I was so angry, I decided not to tell the Manager because I would not have behaved well. I will never go back and not only will I not recommend it, I will be sure to tell many others!

I am the person who does not believe in physical therapy. That is until I was referred by a friend to Landmark Physical Therapy (previously AZOPT). The staff is exceptional; very helpful and friendly. Mark is extremely knowledgeable and very good at what he does. I have some issues that prevent me from doing the "typical" exercises...Mark came up with terrific alternatives that help keep my progress going. I look forward to going and always feel better when I leave. If you need PT, THIS is the place to go!

I finally made it here for lunch. While the decor is modern sterile, the chairs were comfortable and the service was terrific. Everyone had a smile on their face. I had the Asian Salad and is was fresh and awesome, I ate it ALL. The barista made her own "specialty" drink (not on the menu) for my friend and while it was a tad too sweet for me, it was delicious. She made me a soy chai tea latte. FABULOUS! even better than the one I get at Starbucks. Prices are really good, especially for the area.

While I heard they have other locations, this is the very first time we went to this (new) location on Northsight Blvd. Amazing food.  I struggled with the menu because it is so different from Mexican restaurants. I don't remember what the name of it was but it was shredded pork with a chipoltle sauce with corn tortillas. FABULOUS! Service was good and the place was very busy. I am looking forward to returning!

1st time here and came for lunch!  Great looking decor, very comfortable. Terrific and attentive staff that really knows what their food tastes like so that they can answer questions. The chips were not greasy and salsa amazing (on the sweeter side which I like). I had the Chili Relleno filled with carnitas. The meat was spectacular as was the rest of it. Came with red and green sauce. Beautiful presentation. Can't wait to come back and have Carnitas for dinner. Also had the Chicken Tanga taco. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only had one and did not need more for a lunch (taco was totally filled)! We will definately be back! If we didn't have dinner plans, we would be here tonight!! GREAT to finally have wonderful Mexican fare in the area!
