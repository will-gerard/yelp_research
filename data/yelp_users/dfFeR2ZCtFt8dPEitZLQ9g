Substandard at best. Garlic Nan was a regular nan, and out of the 4 pieces, 2 were like hockey pucks. Of course I was charged for the garlic nan. Won't be back!

Best Chinese food ever. There's a reason they have been in business for 19 years. Everyone is exceptional, and all items on the menu are delicious.

Bought my gear there for years, and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute I walked in and said rudely, " take of your backpack and leave it up front". Seriously, really. The amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on, takes forever. Am I really going to shove something into a backpack that's fastened to my back? No other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever, specially some hippy long haired ass wipe. You guys went down hill fast. NEVER, ABSOLUTELY NEVER WILL I STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE YOUR STORE AS LONG AS I BREATH AIR. Oh, and BTW, I went that day and bought my helmet of decent people, AZMotorsports. Yeah it was more expensive, but they were polite, and they actually knew about the products. Perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue. Keep your BILT crap, and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons!

My wife and I decided to check this place out for restaurant week, so we went last night. First off, they have a table right next to a stairs with high traffic, so I asked if we could be moved, no problem at all.  So, our wait person introduced himself as "Bucky". We looked at menu and then asked for the restaurant week menu, as we had never eaten there before.  Appetizers were okay, main dish was very nice and the deserts were nothing to write home about. Here's my biggest issue.  "Bucky" is as useless as tits on a bull, unless your at a table with 4 or more people, I guess he thinks bigger tip. Not one time during start to finish did he ask if  everything was okay. Terrible terrible service, he's in the wrong profession. Because of our experience, we won't eat their again or recommend to anyone. I had a better experience at a Jimmy John's

Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back

Bobby is such a stud, sweet sexy man, and always greets me with a smile. His hair is always up to par with Paul Mitchell's standards. The craic is always mighty, and sometimes whale world is on the box!!!

Best cheese steak I've ever had, period. Great guys. Friendly service. Food comes out hot, and tastes fantastic. We all go here for lunch now.
