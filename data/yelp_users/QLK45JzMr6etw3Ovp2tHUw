Rude customer service and always dirty.  This is the reason people shop at tj maxx instead.

The son of the owner, Austin, came to my house when my mother was there wating for him and was EXTREMELY rude to her. Now my mother is a 76 year old, kind hearted gentle woman who was doing me a favor by waiting at the house for 4 hours for this company to show up and repair my garage. However Austin took advanatge of her gentle nature by insulting her and being rude from the start. When she mentioned to him what she thought was wrong with it (I left a detailed list of what was going on with the opener)..he responded "I dont have time to listen to you" and took his ladder off his truck and went into the garage...when she questioned why he was disconnecting the garage door opener when that was not party of the problem, he said "You know, I am done here!", took his ladder and left.  I cannot believe that a person would treat a customer that way.  My mother has never been treated like this in her life by someone and was very upset and insulted.  To actually have this employee be the SON of the OWNER shows what a spoiled brat this kid is and how he was raised. It also shows the lack of integrity that this business has in dealing with the public. The owner and the son should both hold their heads down in shame for treating a customer this way.  You want to be treated badly....call this business....if you want a little respect...move on and choose another! SHAMEFUL!!!!

Even after multiple calls demanding an apology the owner never called me back. This conpany is shameful and I reported them to my home warranty company as well.

Incredible customer service.  Me and my friend where there after they closed and we were never rushed or even pushed to leave. Didn't even know they were closed. Classy people.

Worst experience in a cigar bar ever!!! This is my first ever 1 star rating on yelp. I always support local businesses and am never quick to complain about bad service...But wow.. This was bad... Came in.. Sat down.. No acknowledgment. Place only had a few people in it... thought.. Who knows maybe something was keeping waitress busy.  Patience is a virtue.. .. Waited some more. Lit up a pipe... Waited some more.  Made eye contact with the waitress... Waited some more..looked at beers on Wall... Waited some more.... Zilch... Squat. Waited some more... 20 min later decided to go to a real cigar bar a few more miles away where at least your treated decently. Bye house of cigars... Hello foxes cigar bar.
