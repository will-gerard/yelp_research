Good luck trying to cancel! Contract states you need 6 full months of member ship. So when you try to cancel after the 6 months the OWNER tells you the first month doesn't count it's your start up fee even though it is a full month payment. Even her girls working there don't understand it the way she does. What's worse is when I was trying to explain this to her she put the phone down and I could hear her talking about me. Thanks goodness for banks and their fraud protection against frauds like her because I don't trust now that I won't be charged an 8th month!

Worst DD ever(and I've been to a lot) donuts are raw. No sugar in coffee and they stuff 4 donuts in a bag just to get all the frosting melted on each other. So frustrating. Service is slow! And the drive thru with parking lot is suicidal! Rittenhouse and power worth the drive!

The breakfast took a long time but when it finally did it was good! But a little pricey for eggs and bacon!
