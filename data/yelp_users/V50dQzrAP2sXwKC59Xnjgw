No doubt, hands down the BEST hole in the wall mexican food. So damn good, you won't see Joe Arpio here! I've come here since the 80's! The smokey salsa will have you addicted and you will make long trips to get here! The carne asada is juicy, tender and flavorful.  The tacos are chucked full of meat and cheese, they never skimp on anything they serve you. The beans are smooth and creamy and add some of the hot sauce, perfect dip combo! I always order extra when I visit as I have moved out of the area years ago, and it's along ways over. And mostly I just don't want the ride to be over so soon, I want to continue the Fiesta my taste buds are having for at least another meal! The prices are awesome for $10.00 you get a plateful here! The service is good too always treated kindly and efficiently.

Shrug....if you didn't know better, this might seem like a good place to eat. If you haven't had better, I have. Waste of money, there places that are better for less money. I'll leave The Keg to the prommers.

Awesome food! Delish fish, all fresh and succulent. We went on a Saturday around 5. Got right in, but we're pit in a tight table in the bar, OK not so bad except I saw booths and bigger tables open. Service was OK, our gal ( I'll refrain from using her name) was a little disoriented. Might of been a bad day or she was new. Our dishes came out at different times. We specifically asked for our crab legs to be cut for the elderly guest at table, they weren't. She took the back and showed back up about 15 minutes later, after we were pretty much done. She had already brought the butter for the legs but didn't exchange it, and it was cold. But I'll just chalk this one up as a bad day for her. But she was nice and wasn't rude just seemed disoriented. But I want to eat here again and will be back as the food was awesome!!

i am only picking one star because you have to pick at least that. been a customer several years and have brought countless people with me. but today is my last day here. i have told them repeatedly i do not like or want kevin that sits on the second row. he pulls my hands around and twisted them and hurts. i have cancer and am somewhat fragile. if i move around a little bit he stops and just looks at me, like i'm annoying him! my god you do have to move around a little as it is i'm leaning forward. he is not pleasant and is pushy. so if anyone has any suggestions for a new nail shop, i and several of my friends are looking.

Awesome! Great fresh tasting salads and pizza! We got 4 mod size pizza and 2 large salads, $40.00. We were 2 couples and we shared and sampled each other's pizza and shared our large salads with our spouses. And we each took home a pizza! You can pick as little or as many toppings you want, as well as the salad. You go down the line and let them know what you want. Trust me you won't have time enough to eat your salad before the pizza done!! Brick oven too!!
