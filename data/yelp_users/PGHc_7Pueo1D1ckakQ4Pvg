I actually finally signed up on yelp just to review this place.  Probably the easiest and best haircut I've had in recent memory.  Adrian took care of me.  Great guy, listened to what I wanted and suggested some other things that I would never have thought of.  Easy, enjoyable, and got a great cut.  It is a bit pricey, but you could pay 20 at some cookie cutter place and get half the experience.

Probably the most painless, easiest, and quickest car fix I've ever had. All the reviews of this place are correct: the service is great and they get it done without making you sign away your first born child.  No extras or addons.  Amazingly convenient if you live downtown, as there is a DASH stop across the street.

My friend took me here the other night - shocked I hadn't visited since moving to Phoenix last year. I'm a big fan of their Kiltlifter brew and wasn't disappointed to try it straight from the brewery.    Nice atmosphere with the interesting and eclectic mix of people Tempe seems apt to provide.  Perfect place to chill and tell some ridiculous stories with your friends.  Plus, all the waitresses are pretty cute :)

When you get the simplest mexican foods to taste similar to cardboard, you are doing something quite wrong.  Perhaps, grease isn't a seasoning?   Pretty much the only thing going for this place is its location in the bottom of ASU's Cronkite School downtown.
