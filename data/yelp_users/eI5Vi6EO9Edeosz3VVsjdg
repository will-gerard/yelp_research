Not a good place to go! We waited FOREVER to get back to a room with only a few people in front of us. Staff in the front office and in the back didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing. After over 2 hours the doctor decided to treat my husband for bacterial pneumonia but wouldn't prescribe any antibiotics for our 7 year old whom she saw at the same time for the same symptoms. During check out nobody could figure out what are deductible was. Bad experience altogether. Urgent care shouldn't be such a painful process.

Brought in a coupon for a free 6" sub with the purchase of one of equal or greater value. I decided to get a footlong for me and the six inch for my son. I feel totally ripped off. They said in order to use the coupon they would have to ring it in as 3 separate six inch subs because the computer wouldn't recognize the coupon with a footlong. So in the end I ended up paying more for the 2 six inch sandwiches than I would have if I had just paid for my footlong and a six inch. Totally bugged!

After an hour wait I had hoped that the food would make up for it, boy was I wrong. The atmosphere was loud and busy as expected and the table was clean and neat. After ordering chips and salsa and a round of hand crafted sodas for the table it took a while for the server to come back to take our order. The chips and salsa arrived and the chips were crispy and delicious, the salsa was pretty good as well although we found multiple french fries swimming in the bottom of it, the only thing that would have made them better was more chips as we ate all of the them within 5 minutes of receiving the plate. Next the salads came out and both were tasty, no complaints there. Then we waited for a long time for our food to come out..... My husbands ribs were hot but over done. They were chewy and the outside was crispy and hard to eat. I ordered the ziti, which was not the smallest I've seen but not huge either. The noodles were okay but some were either undercooked or burnt because they were very crunchy. The sauce was pretty tasty but not much better than a store bought and there was so little meat that I could hardly find it. Finally, our server took forever to bring us our check making our time at the table over an hour. Overall the entire experience was less than great and it did not make me feel like returning anytime soon.

Barro's is the best pizza joint around! Great food and good customer service!! You can't beat the lunch specials either.

This review is late but well deserved. I hired another company that offered a mobile tint service to come to my home to tint my car and it was the absolute worst job I have ever seen first hand.  Thankfully, I took my car to Randy and he was able to fix all of the tint quickly and efficiently. In no time at all he was able to strip the old tint and reapply the new tint perfectly. Not only do the windows look great but he was also friendly and professional. I would highly recommend his place.

I have been here a few times for pedicures and they always do a fantastic job. Finally got my finger nails done for the first time in over a year. I have always hated getting my nails done because of how painful it can be at times. That was not the case here. They were so incredibly nice and gentle with my nails! I had a great experience and love the way they look. I will definitely be going back!

Delicious!! Everything on the menu is fantastic! This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. Bacon was crispy, eggs were fluffy, the grits were creamy and amazing and if course the buttermilk pancakes were perfect. To top it all off the staff was very attentive and friendly!!! A+++ I can't wait for my next visit!

I have been going to eat at Rudy's for many years and have yet to have a bad meal. Their brisket is the best you can find, their sauce is the boss and the cream corn can't be beat! I love that they do a family-style that allows for you to visit with family and friends while enjoying the delicious food. To top it off their staff is always friendly and welcoming you and their manager Marcus is one of the most personable people you'll ever meet! If you're in the mood for some barbecue in a casual setting this is the place for you!

Horrible horrible service! For the third time in a row the service was so awful we have decided not to go back to this restaurant. Not only did we have to get our own silverware after 15 minutes of staring at our bread, it took them 25 minutes to get us our sandwiches and over 30 for the soup. The food was pretty tasty but our server was dingy, unapologetic and fake. Never again.

The only place I trust to cut my kids hair. Destiny is out absolute favorite hair stylist we have found. All of the staff are friendly and attentive and it's always clean. Highly recommended you try it!

I have only been to this restaurant twice and I have to say that I am a fan. This place makes Subway look really bad! Not only is the staff here very friendly and good at their jobs but the food there is just delicious. I Love the fact that everything is cut fresh before your eyes instead of wondering how long its been sitting in this nasty tub out in the room temperature air. A big thumbs up.

After waiting for this amazing place to open I finally made it in and I can say that it was well worth the wait. I have never been to a Rudy's location that I didn't like this one included. If you have never been to a Rudy's before then I highly recommend you try it. If you are looking for a fine dining experience then this is not the place for you. Rudy's is a place for families to get together and enjoy some good BBQ in a family style, self serve setting. The brisket is succulent, the chicken is delish, and the sauce is the boss!!!
