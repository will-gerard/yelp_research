I recently discovered that I am gluten intolerant. What distressed me most was the thought of not having savory, delicious Thai food again. After a quick Yelp search I found Wild Thaiger who has a decent vegetarian and gluten free menu.   I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, veggies and brown rice. OMG!!!! It was sooooo good. It cost extra to substitute white rice with brown. Not sure why it's an extra cost but whatever. I ordered it from the list of lunch specials. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their lack of vegetarian soup options. The lunch specials include soup and egg roll. Well, there should be a non meat based soup for your vegan and vegetarian customers. That being said, I will most certainly return and get the exact same meal!!

I am from Chicago where authentic Mexican restaurants are abundant. I would not consider what I ate yesterday at Matador Mexican food.   The waiter brought chips & salsa to the table. The salsa was a spicy red sauce that I would pour over pasta....I'm dead serious! The fish taco entree arrived quickly. There was a ton of fish which was nice, but it came with a side of shredded "cheddar" cheese, shredded cabbage and chopped tomato. The rice & beans that came with were no better. I think the rice was Rice-O-Roni and the beans had a think layer of burnt "cheddar'" cheese on top. WTF am I suppose to do with that?  This was my first meal in AZ. It has to get better than that.

The hubby & I have been visiting Phoenix for about a week. We were here on Easter. Normally, we would be at my grandma's for dinner which would consist of fried chicken, greens, ham, mac & cheese and whatever dessert my ma decides to make. I usually eat light and avoid fried food, but I kinda missed that traditional Easter dinner. Karim's was closed Sunday, but thank goodness they were open Monday.  Catfish was perfectly seasoned and crispy. Delicious!  The potato salad was a little sweet, not what I'm used to. The peach cobbler was fantastic.   I think we're going back there for lunch today. Hopefully, they have greens today, they didn't yesterday.  Their hours are tricky so call ahead or check their website before you go.

The take care clinic is a life saver!!  Last weekend I was visiting my family for Mother's Day weekend. I stayed 2 nights at a hotel and was attacked by bed bugs. Fortunately, I didn't bring them back to Arizona. Seven days after the initial contact the bites have swelled and become painful. Dr. Lani said my bites became infected due to a bacteria one of the bugs was carrying. GROSS!!!!!!   I showed up without an appointment and without insurance. An hour later I was seen by the doctor and given 2 prescriptions all for under $150. Thank you Walgreens Take Care Clinic.

We've driven by this place countless times. It wasn't until a coworker told me about it that I noticed it. Like a lot of restaurants in Phoenix, CB is in a strip mall which I'm starting to get used to.   Went at lunchtime, it wasn't crowded initially, but filled up quickly. Started out with the vegetable tempura. It was okay, just a basic tempura. I ordered the grilled salmon lunch special which came with brown rice and salad. I wasn't crazy about the salad dressing, but the salmon was awesome. Two substantial, well seasoned fillets. With a lunch special you expect the smallest fillet with a ton of rice, not at CB.    My hubby ordered the sausage in red sauce as an appetizer and the hot beef salad. I don't eat meat so I didn't his food (bummer), but he seemed very pleased,   I look forward to returning and trying some Italian dishes. Also, CB is extremely clean and the staff is attentive.

I love this store. It's colorful, warm and inviting. They have food, wine, soda, bracelets, furniture, etc. I could literally spend several hours here.  Yesterday we stopped by hoping to find a non-traditional coffee table. We walked out with chipotle chocolate, silverware, ice cube trays and a bench that we are using as a coffee table. Their prices are very reasonable, I think they could charge more and people would still shop there.  Did I mention that I love this store?

I rarely give 1 star reviews, but in this case I had no choice. I needed an appointment on fairly short notice so when I found Dr. Kramer had an opening for the next day I jumped on it. I made my appointment online via Zoc Doc. I was also able to fill out all my paperwork online avoiding a long wait at the office. Arrive at 3:30 for my 3:45 appointment. The office was filled with screaming children. The receptionist needed my ID and insurance card. I had to fill out a quick consent form which was fine.   45 minutes later I'm summoned back to Dr. Kramer office. I waited another 10 minutes in there before his PA arrived. She then proceeds to ask  me every single question that I already answered online which should have eliminated this long ass process. Finally Dr. Kramer arrives at 5:00. More questions, more examining. His conclusion was that I did not have a bacterial infection. I did however have a viral infection. He prescribed a Z pack. 4 days later and I feel exactly the same. I called his office yesterday and told them what is going on. I was then told that what he prescribed won't work because I did not have a bacterial infection and viral infections go away on it's on in about 6 weeks, but the Dr. needs to see you again. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? I asked the lady what he was going to do different on my next visit that he didn't do on the first visit. No answer.  Needless to say, I will not be returning to Dr. Kramer. If you simply want to give your money away I suggest an organization like PAWS (pets are worth saving) because Dr. Kramer ripped me off and had the nerve to try to do it a second time.

I really, really like this place. Several people have mentioned this place to my husband and yesterday we finally gave it a try.....what took so long?!   Yesterday we stopped by for lunch. We started with the white bean hummus and warm artichoke appetizer served with flatbread. Umm, so good! For my meal I ordered the veggie sandwich on toasted focaccia bread with a side Meditterean salad. Ummmm, so good! My husband went with the chicken sandwich instead, it was sweet and spicy at the same time. For dessert we split the chocolate bouchon. Ummmmmmmmmmm, so incredibly good. Why did I let my husband have the last bite? Next time I will order my own, it is simply too good to share.  This will be the new place I take friends & family when they come to visit.

I was extremely underwhelmed with Tuesday Morning. The commercial with Lauren Bacall is classy, this place is not. It remined me of a thrift store. There is nothing wrong with thrift stores, in fact I've been to many, but the prices are thrifty....not at Tuesday Morning.

Here is my summary of Streets of NY:  1) Greek salad-4 stars 2) Italian wedding soup-4 stars  3) Pizza-1 star.   I've been to NY and this is not NY style pizza. Regardless of that, it simply isn't good. It reminded me Pizza Hut. Do not order the soup if you are on a low sodium diet. The delivery was prompt which was good....I guess.

This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.  The manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.  I will not be returning.

I am a Chicagoan. Not the suburbs of Chicago, but the heart of the city. There are a number of things I miss about my city: Garrett's popcorn, neighbood festivals every weekend, Lou Malnati's pizza and of course my family.....not necessarily in that order. When someone says they have Chicago-style pizza I feel it is my duty to try it. There are a bunch of pizza places in Chicago that have amazing pizza and they all do it differently so there isn't just way one to make Chicago-style pizza, but Spinato's came pretty damn close.   We ordered the Chicago-style with 1/2 mushroom for my man. The mixture of yellow and red bell pepper was a nice touch, most places use green bell peppers. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, I'm not used to that. The pizza was not greasy, had the right amount of cheese and toppings and the cornmeal crust reminded me of home.   I'm happy to say that Spinato's lived up to the hype.

My husband & I are relocating from Chicago to the Phoenix. Knowing very little about the neighborhoods in Phoenix we thought it was best to go through a service.   The office is extremely dated, but don't let that deter you. Our assigned agent was Jim. After spending 20 minutes in the office with Jim discussing what we're looking for in an apartment he searched on his computer, set up 3 appointments and we fell in love with the first one.   Thanks for all your help Jim!

I was able to get a same day appointment for Rudy, my kitty. We walk in and are greeted not only by a friendly staff, but a chubby tabby chilling on the floor. It think his name is Mo and was too precious for words.   After filling out the paperwork we are brought back to the waiting room. Rudy doesn't like new people at all so he growled and hissed at just about everybody who looked at him. Dr. Cellers asked our permission before sedating him to take samples. I like that he asked first. While Rudy was knocked out he talked about what may be going on health wise and options.   One day later we get the results and options of how to proceed. Rudy is now on meds. There prices are extremely reasonable. We are new to Arizona and hope every place we encounter are as wonderful as DHAH.  P.S. Their prices are reasonable.

My husband and I were in the area yesterday having lunch and stopped here on our way back home. Most people don't enjoy grocery shopping, but I enjoyed shopping here. We live within 5 blocks of Sunflower Market and do 99% of our shopping there, I didn't think there would be a huge difference between the 2 stores, but I was wrong. The produce at Sprouts is fantastic. I bought oranges that were the size of grapefruits and grapefruits that were the size of melons. You get more bang for your buck at Sprouts without spending more money.  Whenever we are in the area again we will certainly return, I look forward to my next visit:)

WOW!!!!   It's about a 15 minute drive up the mountain. At first we were disappointed and thought, "yippie. dry, brown, rock. can't wait to see more." The further up you go it becomes amazing. The roads are winding and the views are unbeatable. Once at the top it was crowded especially Dobbins Lookout. You can see the entire city. it was sorta windy and we could see mini dust storms in the distance. On the drive down there are areas where you can pull over and take more photos.  Next time we visit the mountain we will be prepared to hike and maybe go at sunrise or sunset.

I don't know why I keep coming to this, I always think "this time it will be different", but it never is.   They are extremely overpriced and the smell of perfuming is like a brick upside your head. I only use Dermalogica products so the 20% off coupon is useless for me and I can buy OPI & Essie nail polishes at Target. I think I've finally learned my lesson and will stop expecting more from this establishment.

I don't get it. When people here that I am from Chicago they ALL recommend Oregano's.  My husband works near the Shea location and brought a pizza home. The crust was super thin which I like, but it lacked pizzazz. I like deep dish, pan, thin crust, super thin, etc, but I did not like Oregano's. Also, they are more on the expensive side.

I've eaten here twice in 1 week and ordered the same dish twice. Spudburger with spices and herbs over basmati & yellow rice and a side salad. Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. My husband who loves meat found the food as delicious as I did.The menu consists of meat, but I would say the food is primarily vegetarian and vegan.  Other reviewers said this place is not Persian food. Honestly, they can call it whatever they want as long as they keep making the food scrumptious.

There are several dentists in my network, but none have the positive reviews like Paul D. Woodbury. This is a small, tight-knit dental office which I like. The office manager/receptionist Lisa greeted me with a smile and firm handshake....nice touch. My hygienist was Sherry who is outstanding at her job. She explained everything she did which is not unusual, but she was interesting too. I've never requested a hygienist before, but I made sure to book my next cleaning with her in 6 months.

When we pulled up to the restaurant there wasn't a single parking space left which is always a good sign. We were greeted by a friendly waitress and seated immediately. This place is smallish, but can easily accommodate large groups.   I ordered the egg rolls which are vegetarian (yeah) and the salmon with panang curry, asparagus and broccoli. It was incredible, tons of flavor. I have finally found a Thai restaurant that I will visit again.

I'm done with Thai Rama!!! Today we went for lunch. The lunch menu is scarce on vegetarian options so I ordered from the main menu. Assorted vegetables & tofu in yellow curry. They brought out a green curry dish. Not what I ordered. My husband ordered the chicken & shrimp fried rice. One shrimp came with the dish. One!!!! When he told the owner/manager about it he said that he told my husband it came that way. Wow!! That conversation NEVER took place.   Final straw, he ordered a regular iced tea. The waitress forgot to bring it so he asked the owner/manager for a tea. A few minutes later he brings the tea and five more minutes later she brings a Thai iced tea. My husband does not like cream in his tea and would NOT order it that way, but both beverages appeared on the check. Instead of complaining about a tea we'll simply take our business elsewhere. Thai E San here we come.

Ok, I'm going to try my best to write a review without sounding too judgmental of my fellow neighbors. I've been to this theater several times because it is near my home. I never felt compelled to write a review until today. I thought I was being smart by going to a 10:00 am show on the 4th of July. I could avoid the crowd and noisy people. There were 7 people in the theater including myself. The guy 2 rows behind me felt the need to yawn loudly throughout the entire show, talk to himself and talk to the screen. Now you have to yawn pretty damn loudly to be heard over the sounds coming from the screen. The couple 4 rows below were sharing a vapor pen. Fortunately there was no odor just the occasional cloud of smoke that would linger in the air. Is it that serious that you can't go 2 frigging hours without a frigging puff?!?!?!  The majority of the people that visit this establishment are regular, quiet folks wanting to see a show. Sadly there is that group of riffraff that give this Harkins a bad name. I can't say that I will never return to this theater, but if I do it will be to see a sad, depressing drama that the riffraff don't care to see. I don't have a solution but something needs to change at this theater.

I'm so glad I found this. The furniture is unique and looks like one of a kind. They carry sofas, chairs, dining sets, dressers, bookcases, pillows, etc. The inventory does move quickly so if you see something you like grab it. Everything we looked at was in pretty good condition. Some stuff may need repair, but with the money you'll save it's worth it.  Lastly, feel free to negotiate. My husband is in sales and never pays full price. We left with a love seat, matching chair and pillow and paid considerably less than the ticket price.

I'm not used to finding delicious food in a strip mall. I'll have to get over that now that I no longer live in Chicago.   When we arrived yesterday evening we were the only people there, but it quickly filled up. I thought the restaurant served Mexican food and was pleasantly surprised to discover Peruvian, Ecuadorian and Colombian influences. Total we had arepas, tamalas and Peruvian carne asada and we very pleased.   The only con is that the service is slow. Our waiter was an older gentleman who moved at a slower pace. When you think about it....what's the hurry?

Today I took a continuing education course at Sky Song which lasted for 8 hours. I knew the snacks I packed would only hold me over for a couple of hours. i was pleasantly surprised when a classmate found this place.  I ordered the samosa appetizer that came with a cinnamony dipping sauce. This is the first time I've had samosas that were not heavy & greasy. My main meal was the lemon pesto with mock chicken (carrots & zucchini were thrown in). Everything taste sooooo good. The pesto was so lemony and the mock chicken taste like chicken. It's been a really long time since I've had chicken and I hadn't realized how much I missed it. I'm taking another continuing education course next month and can't wait to eat here again.

I'm seriously confused by all the positive reviews. My husband's co-worker said this place was good. We've driven by many times and it's always crowded so we gave it a try last night.  The interior is nothing to write home about. Maybe the divey look is what they are going for so I won't knock it. Surprisingly, they have a decent vegetarian menu. I ordered the veggie fajitas, no rice and no beans. I'm used to the fajita being served in a mini skillet that's sizzling hot with goodness......NOPE. What I received was a hot plate with diced vegetables, a side of corn tortillas and a side of guac & sour cream. The veggie mixture consisted primarily of tomatoes and carrots. Where are the bell peppers??? The veggies were not marinated or seasoned so I relied heavily on the salsa to punch up the flavor. My husband got the carne asada plate which came with rice & beans and tons of cheese melted on top. He too relied heavily on the salsa. I will say that the wait staff was friendly.  If you want Americanized Mexican food then go here. If you want an extensive tequila selection then go here. I don't care for either therefore I will not be back.

The chicken gyro was a skimpy on the chicken. I would give that 3 stars. The roasted red pepper hummus was good. It's regular hummus with a dollop of roasted red pepper in the center. That portion was a little skimpy too. I'd also give that 3 stars.   The hands down winner was the lemon chicken soup. OMG! Whoever thought of adding lemon to chicken soup is a genuis. My sister & I split that, we were both secretly wishing we could have it all to ourselves:)

I don't know if this restaurant is Mexican, Puerto Rican or Cuban, but I don't get it. We split the monster quesadilla which has jack cheese, monterey cheese some tomato and jalapeno peppers. I went with the sweet corn tamale as my entree that came with rice & beans and a red sauce. The tamales were 2 scoops of cornmeal. My husband had the grilled burrito topped with queso cheese.   I don't mean to be critical, but nothing at all about our meal was authentic, everything taste processed.  Disappointed.

What a lovely restaurant. It is literally tucked away on a residential street so pay close attention or you will miss it, better yet just use your GPS.  So, we went yesterday for a pre-birthday lunch for me and my sister. I started with the spinach salad with citrus vinegarette dressing, BACON, goat cheese and candied walnuts. It's an entree side so I split it with my man. My main course was the stuffed empanadas. It came with a large portion of beans & rice. Um, um, good!! At most restaurants it seems like the beans & rice are an afterthought, but not here. Everything was perfectly seasoned.   Surprisingly, I managed to save room for dessert. Key lime pie with topped with toasted coconut. I'm a key lime pie connoisseur and this is as good as it gets.  Our waiter told us about how happening Fuego gets on weekend nights with a live band, can't wait to return on the weekend.

Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  Good: 1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen. 2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area. 3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself. 4) Cool decor both interior and exterior.   Bad: 1) Bed pillows were too squishy.  2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue. 3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.  Ugly: 1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really "ugly".  Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit.

I've been to this theater many times. After reading some of the negative reviews I decided to post my own. The dine-in option at this theater is NOT fine dining, it is convenience food. The food is expensive and not very good. I don't eat meat so there are even fewer options for me. You can't go wrong with their popcorn, it's one size fits all or bring your own snack.  We were at this theater a couple of months ago and a couple brought their young child and their baby. Once the baby started crying they left. I disagree with one review that said this place is not for kids. If an animated kid friendly movie is showing by all means bring your kid along. If it's an adult film leave your kid at home.  We pay a little bit more to come here because the seats are extremely comfortable and my husband can enjoy a beer while enjoying the movie. The staff has always been friendly, courteous and quiet.   Two tickets for a mid week matinee = $21.

I don't understand the negative reviews. This place is heavenly.   Yesterday we were craving sweets when we stumbled across Urban Cookies on yelp. OMG....I am so glad we found UC. We each got a cookie and a cupcake. I can't speak for my husband's desserts because he was not in a sharing mood.....try their desserts and you won't share either.  The pineapple coconut cookie is the best cookie ever. It was moist & chewy in the center and a little crunchy around the outside. Now for the lemon cupcake. Light, moist cake with a whipped lemony frosting. My mission in life is to try every flavor cupcake they have.

Cox is atrocious.  Before moving to Phoenix we had Directv. Because of the direction our apartment faces the dish could not be installed so we went with Cox. Once our introductory period was up our service became really crappy. The HD channels that we pay extra for are fuzzy & jumpy. A technician came out a couple of weeks ago and made some repairs and adjustments. Everything was working fine for about a week and slowly the fuzziness & jumpiness returned in first the HD channels. Now all the channels are crappy. I just finished chatting online with a rep. I can't bare to talk to someone on the phone. I would curse someone out. Another technician is coming back on Friday, this time I requested they replace the digital box. Oh, and we can't access OnDemand programming either.   We haven't had any problem with our internet, that's why they get 1 star. Once our contract is up which I hope is soon we are cancelling.

Yesterday I received a facial from Sam. I've had a handful of facials in the past, but this was by far the best. After assessing my skin she decided on the anti aging facial. She explained each product before applying and checked in to make sure I was comfortable. I never knew a facial could be informative, beneficial and relaxing all at the the same time. I fell asleep during the facial massage and woke up wishing there were 2 hour facials.  Sam suggested some products and that it would be beneficial for me to get a facial at least once a month. She was not pushy and because of that I will book her again in a month.

We very recently moved from Chicago to Phoenix and booked the La Quinta for 1 night. Come to find out our belongings won't be delivered to our new apartment until Monday morning. One forgettable night at the La Quinta turns into 4 memorable nights. I selected this hotel because it's near our new apartment, free wi-fi and you could check in a pet at no additional cost.  When I checked in there was a woman in front of me who paid cash. I thought that was strange, but cash is king. We are walking to our room and I notice dried up blood droplets. Gross! We go into our room which is pretty dated. The fridge once had a pad lock on it and is dirty on the outside and not too much better on the inside. Someone left food in the microwave: blueberry muffin, Bimbo bread and a Cup-O-Noodle. It was a long day on the road so we go to bed fairly early. The best part about this hotel is the bed. It was surprisingly comfortable.  The morning of day two I stop by the front desk to inform them that we will be staying 3 more nights. There was a man ahead of me who just paid for his room in cash. Cash is king, but there is A LOT going on at this hotel that I want no parts of.  The evening of day two we decide to chill by the pool. We notice a guy asleep in one of the lounge chairs, fully clothed. It was about 90 degrees. The front desk girl comes from the back side of the pool walking behind a woman who is clearly stoned out of her mind. She starts yelling for "Rusty! Rusty! (the guy asleep in the chair) we gotta go!" Apparently, Rusty and his girl were not guests of the hotel. Later that day the front desk girl, Liz who was as sweet as she wanted to be apologized for everything. It wasn't her fault, but I appreciate her taking care of the situation.  In the wee hours of the morning we are awakened by someone knocking on our neighbors door. When they finally answered the door, the person on the other ends realizes they were knocking on the wrong door and proceed to knock on other door further down.  This hotel is fine for 1 night. Had I known we would need a hotel for 4 nights I would have chosen another hotel.

I love this store. We just moved to Phoenix last week and have been 3 times. I was hoping we would live near a Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, we lucked out being right around the corner from Sunflower Farmers Market. The prices are extremely reasonable and the bulk bin lets you buy just what you'll need.  Not sure why many of the reviews mentioned hippies. I don't care who shops there or who works there as long as they are polite and professional. SFM has excellent customer service.

Finally, a "Chicago style" pizza joint that actually tastes like Chicago pizza!  I am a true Chicagoan (not the suburbs) living here in Phoenix and made it my mission to find great pizza in AZ. Since living here I've tried lots of pizza, but none moved me as much as Rosati's. Contrary to popular belief, "Chicago style" pizza is not just deep dish pan pizza, it can be thin crust and delicious. My sister and I split the thin crust (onion, mushroom, green bell pepper) and it reminded us so much of home. Now all you need to do is open a restaurant in Central Phoenix.

We went here based on all the positive reviews. I should have lowered my expectations. We ordered chips & guac and several 99 cent tacos (fish, beef & chicken). The tacos had a hard shell which I actually like and were topped with a TON of shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese. I mistakenly thought this food would resemble authentic Mexican, it did not. Cheddar cheese does not belong in the kitchen of ANY Mexican restaurant.  The beef tacos were 80% lettuce, 10% cheddar cheese and 10% meat. Seriously, where's the beef??? They give you more meat on the chicken taco. I decided not to eat my remaining beef taco, instead I gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce, cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco. The food was along the same line as Taco Bell. I don't dislike Taco Bell, I just prefer real Mexican food.  The guac was not bad, it was also covered in cheddar cheese.

Not sure what you did, but stop it. The tahini sauce tastes like buttermilk. The pita which used to be thick like a pancake is now as thin as a crepe. I don't know if you have new owners, new cooks, but knock it off and return to normal.  You've lost a customer.

I really like Switch. The crowd was a nice mix of people which is something I look for in a restaurant. We each started with a side Caesar salad which had an abundance of cheese, it was the best Caesar I've ever had. I ordered the mac & cheese with lobster & crab, it was so cheesy and delicious. I paid extra for the seafood, but they seemed a little skimpy with it. My hubby ordered some spicy burger, don't think he'd get it again.  We were seated promptly and received our food quickly. We will be back and next time I'll save room for dessert.

My husband's former employer said when we get to Phoenix we must go to In-N-Out. He said the last time he had one there was a line out the door. Not much of a beef burger person, we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left Ikea and decided to try it. The emergency granola bar I keep in my purse wasn't working.  There was no line out the door, who wants to wait in line anyway. We both ordered a cheeseburger (no tomato, no special sauce, no ketchup for me). It arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh. My burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves. The burger itself was just okay, but the freshness of the toppings won me over. My husband's had a big slice of tomato.   Did In-N-Out live up to the hype from his former employer? Not exactly, but it came pretty close.

I wish I enjoyed H&ST Massage as much as the yelpers, but I did not. Let me start by saying the spa is clean, quiet and relaxing. I was greeted by my therapist and escorted to our room. Again, clean and relaxing. There was a fan blowing cool air which kept my hands cold the entire time.   Now onto the massage. I asked for medium pressure when my therapist said "good because I'm not very good at firm." Huh?! She also mentioned that she has been a therapist for just a few months. Great! I've had plenty of massages and realize everyone has their own style/technique so I tried to keep an open mind. I asked for upper body work (with focus on my neck & shoulders) and feet only. She literally breezed over my feet, arms, hands and neck with the tiniest amount of oil. The lack of oil made it impossible to glide over my muscles instead it felt like a rug burn. The best part of the massage was the ending when a warm lavendar scented towel was placed under my neck.  I had a promotion so the price was $39 which is good because I would be pissed off if I paid full price for that "massage". I think H&ST Massage should train their therapists before allowing them to work on the public.

I don't have a lot of experience with cars or car repair places. I never owned a car until moving to Phoenix. I went here when my husband's car needed some work and vowed to bring my car when the need arose.  Well, 3 months and I'm not a customer. I got a discount on services because my husband referred me. This place is so freaking cool on the inside. The lounge is clean, comfortable, and visually appealing. The staff is hard working and honest. I'm referring EVERYONE I know to 180.

We stayed here 2 nights and it was thoroughly enjoyable. It's not a luxurious, high end hotel, but our stay was comfortable, clean & quiet.  The continental breakfast is pretty standard: biscuits, bagels, muffins, white bread, wheat bread, dried cereals. You can have bacon, eggs, potatoes, but that'll cost extra. The absolute best part of the continental breakfast was the fresh grapefruit and assorted Tazo teas. Someone took the time to segment many grapefruits for our benefit. Love that!  Free parking, free wi-fi, free breakfast!!!

Yesterday we were exploring the downtown Scottsdale area and decided to eat here. I've been to the one in Chicago and knew that the food would be at the very least average. We each ordered the Bento Box lunch. I was blown away!!!!   We got the onion soup, mixed green salad, grilled asparagus and grilled salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and the perfect amount of food.

After all the positive reviews the hubby & I decided to check it out. Upon entering everything looks great, the place is spacious and we were greeted and seated immediately.   I ordered the cajun comb and my husband got the tilipia. While we're waiting for our meals to arrive our waiter offered us fresh baked bread right out of the oven. Not wanting to fill up on bread we declined. We're still sitting there when a roach scurries arcoss the ledge near our booth. ALL BUGS FREAK ME OUT!!!!!!! My husband said it wasn't that big a deal and I should just calm down. The table next to us received their food a couple of minutes before us, as soon as the waiter sat the food on the tray flies swarmed. I tried not to FREAK out but I was really getting uneasy about the safety of our food. Finally, our food comes out a couple of minutes later and I'm eyeballing it like a hawk.....no flies touched it, but it didn't stop them from trying to attack our food once it arrived. It's hard to enjoy your meal while you're swatting away flies and make sure roaches are coming up behind you.   On to the food, my fish was salty and my husband's was buttery. 2 perfectly good pieces of fish were ruined.  While I went to the restroom my hubby ordered a slice of keylime pie for me. The pie was delicious, our waiter was great, the people watching is extremely interesting, but we will never return here.

BEWARE....  I've debated for 2 weeks whether or not to review this place. Obviously, I've decided to and you'll be glad I did.   My husband and I went here Aug. 7th and left with some sort of bug encounter. After the movie we went to the grocery store and then home. Later that evening my hand and arm begin itching, but I don't think anything of it. We both woke up the next morning with bug bites all over are necks, shoulders, arms, hands and a few on the legs. The bites were in clusters, about 5-20 bites per cluster. My bites began to heal in a few days, my husband's did not. We went to the doctor Aug. 14th and were told that his bites became infected. She is guessing someone who sat in the seats prior to us came in contact with poison ivy or scabies and unknowingly (my word) spread it to us....thanks. Jerk!  I've spoken to Naomi at the corporate office who seemed surprised and concerned. She said an exterminator goes to each location monthly to spray. I don't know how thorough a job. I'm not necessarily blaming the Harkins or the person who spread this to us, but I can assure you we will never set foot in that theater again.   Wearing a jacket or pants won't matter, the bugs are that determined.  YOU'VE BE WARNED!

I've been here twice for lunch. Lunch special includes salad, egg roll and entree all for around $10. The place gets really crowded around lunchtime, but turnover moves quickly. They are lacking on customer service. I asked for extra napkins twice which never came. It feels like they are rushing you out to make room for the next person. The service doesn't feel personal. Overall, good bang for your buck.

I absolutely adore this place! A friend suggested we come here for a late lunch on Monday and I jumped at the chance.   Our server brought out ciabatta bread with a orange colored spread, it was buttery and delicious. We started with the appetizer size romaine salad w/ lemon dressing, the croutons were soft and seasoned well. I ordered the thin crust, spicy chicken & caramelized onion pizza. It was the happy hour pizza so it only cost $6.00!!  I look forward to sampling other items from the menu. The reason I gave North 4 stars is because I really liked their outdoor dining area. This place is classy yet casual at the same time.

We stumbled upon this place by accident and I'm glad we did. It was a perfect day for dining outdoors which is what we did. The waitress brought out freshly baked corn bread and butter....nice touch. I ordered the avocado turkey burger which was huge and delicious. My hubby ordered the steak burrito, I don't think he enjoyed his meal as much as I enjoyed mine.  The only complaint was our table. There is a large round bar underneath the table which makes it impossible to fit your legs comfortably. We don't live anywhere near here, but next time we're in the area we will have lunch.

Great location and atmosphere. Maize's is like a friendly neighborhood bar with food. Being vegetarian the selection isn't wide for me, but I make it work. I look forward to going again.

We waited 15 minutes for a table yesterday. It was lunch time and I was craving Thai so we waited......wish we hadn't.   We started with the fried shrimp appetizer, it wasn't bad just not seasoned at all. I ordered the spicy noodles with chicken and my husband ordered the seafood fried rice. My noodles were a tad bit oily. My husband's dish was okay. So, they give you a mountain of food which we had for leftovers last night. Not sure what they put in the food, but it kept us wide awake all night and had me running to the bathroom first thing in the morning. Needless to say, we will not be back.  I really miss good Thai food.

My sister has been a regular of Jeanette's for a couple of months and wanted me to try her. Jeanette is lovely! She rents space out of an office building, but has managed to make her room an oasis. I went in for a brow wax and was very pleased. She uses chocolate & hazelnut wax which made me hungry and relaxed all at the same time. I've been getting my brows waxed for years and never had the chocolate/hazelnut experience.

Another fantastic service from Jeanette. Yesterday I went in for a facial and did not want to get up off the table. She gives you a very soft wrap around towel to put on before climing in between the sheets for your facial. She also gives you the option of extracting your pores or a shoulder/arm massage. She's the expert so I let her decide.  I am a massage therapist and work at an establishment where I get discounts on facials. That being said, I still decided to trek all the way from the Moon Valley area over to Scottsdale for a facial. It was money and time well spent.  Excellent job Jeannette. Thank you!

I finally tried TFK and you should believe the hype.  Thai shrimp dumplings with basil, mint & red chili.....amazing!!!!  Panang curry w/ brown rice & shrimp....fantastic, but needed a little sriracha.  Organic corn & eggplant pizza with sweet onion, roasted garlic, goat cheese & basil....outstanding.   Nectarine & berry cobbler w/ vanilla ice cream....so very good!!!!!!!  Not everyone will enjoy the food as much as I did, but I recommend giving it a try.

I'm stingy with my 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it. I'll admit, I was hesitant to go when my brother suggested it. I assumed it would be trendy, touristy and kinda show-offy which are 3 things I am not, but it wasn't like that at all.   We met here for dinner New Year's Day and this place was packed. We had a reservation for indoor, but decided to change it to outdoor. There was a 10 minute wait for a seat so the hostess gave us complimentary mini margaritas. There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant which is kinda small and intrusive so I was delighted when we were led to the back outdoor area. It was spacious and nicely decorated. There were several large heaters throughout the patio which kept us comfortable.   We started out with chips and the best salsa I've ever had....it was so good we ordered another bowl. We also got mission fries & guac. The guac was very original: avocado, cheese, onion, cilantro, tomato, lime and pumpkin seeds. It was great. I went with the pork belly lettuce wraps, 3 come in a serving. I think I died and went to heaven, I only wish I had 10 more. My husband got the chimichurri hangar steak. He asked for medium, but it was more like rare. I don't eat red meat that often and the fact that it was literally red turned me off. My brother ordered the mahi mahi tacos, 3 come in a serving. The waited suggested he order a 4th taco because they are on the small side. The tacos were fabulous. He aslo got a side of Tennessee, chipotle grits. They were creamy, smoky and yummy.  This is the first meal since moving to Phoenix that I really enjoyed. I wish I had more of everything.   A shout out to Sal, our wonderful waiter. We will be back.

I'm just visiting Phoenix and this is the only restaurant that is open on Sundays and open till 1:00 am. This is a very nice and spacious restaurant/lounge. There were couples, familes with children, single ladies at the bar, etc. The mix was diverse, not sure how it would be Thur-Sat nights.  I ordered the Hanny's salad which was huge and delicious, my husband got a side salad which was bigger than most. We split the pepperoni & onion pizza. The pizza was good (I'm from Chicago's so my standards for pizza are crazy high) and had a very thin, cripsy crust. For dessert I ordered the doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce. The outer part of the donut was perfect, but the middle was slightly doughy.....maybe make smaller sizes so it cooks thoroughly.  Overall, a pleasant experience. When we're in downtown Phoenix again we will return.

The tamales are outstanding. I've had many tamales over the years and there was always plenty of masa and very little filling......NOT at The Tamale Store. The tamales are meaty, substantial and delicious. I look forward to the fall so I can try the sweet tamales.  We are having family over for dinner next Sunday and will be stopping here to pick up tamales.

We were deciding between US Egg and Scramble, I'm so glad we decided to go here. I ordered the vegetarian scramble with sun dried tomato, squash, zucchini, onion and Monterey cheese. The sweetness from the tomato was delicious. The scramble came with rosemary potatoes and toast. Rosemary + crispy potatoes, what's not to love? I decided to skip the toast and add the whole wheat pancakes. When our waitress set my plate down the smell of cinnamon was overwhelming and inviting. They put fresh cinnamon in the pancake batter.   I don't normally eat a large breakfast, but from time to time I will make an exception and visit Scramble. The restaurant is very clean, simply decorated and had good music in the background.

For a person who rarely eats donuts I've had a Lamar Donut, a Bosa Donut and a Dunkin Donut all this month. I bought a dozen, assorted frosted donuts for my co-workers last weekend. I ordered a apple fritter for myself. I can't comment on the other donuts because I didn't try one.  Now on to my apple fritter. What Bosa and Lamar's apple fritter have in common is the lack of apple. It's a good fritter, but I wouldn't call it an apple fritter. Also, Lamar's fritter is giant in size compared to it's competitors. If I'm craving a fritter and i'm in the area I'll stop in otherwise, I won't go out of my way.

The saying "You get what you pay for" keeps going through my mind. Well, I paid quite a bit yesterday for a mani/pedi and was disappointed.  My nail tech was friendly and chatty. I let her know I wanted my cuticles pushed back and trimmed, she did not do what I asked for. She left gaps at the base of each nail bed unpolished. She left hangnails on several nails.   I did not think I needed to micro manage my nail tech at The Westin Kierland. I assumed every service at a Starwood property would be amazing. I was wrong. A different lady did my pedicure and it looks fantastic.  When I my husband got home last night he said, "I'm disappointed for you."

We ended up here because everything else was closed on Superbowl Sunday and we were both pleasantly surprised. I've been wanting to try this place ever since I saw them on Check Please  My husband and I each had the salmon with grilled veggies. It was delicious!!! For dessert we split the key lime tart which was decent. We will return for the fish.

My husband and I LOVE the pizza. He went with the mushroom & ricotta pizza and I went with the build-your-own. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, it had a pine nut brittle. FANTASTIC. We can't wait to go back.  Our waitresses personality was a little lackluster, but the food more than made up for it.

I've had a couple of donuts from another Bosa location and these are pretty much the same. My favorite is the apple fritter. While it is quite good, it is mostly fritter and little apple. It's rare that I eat donuts, but when I'm in the area I will stop in.

All of my reviews since relocating to Phoenix mention the fact that I am from Chicago. Well, I have to mention it again. Lo-Lo's is a soul food restaurant with true soul!! I thought I would have to wait until I went back to Chicago before I could get a meal like this. From the moment we stepped foot in Lo-Lo's it felt like home. The staff was friendly and nice, even our fellow diners were friendly.  The chicken and fried catfish was perfect. The waffles were so good, they put cinnamon in the batter. As much as I enjoyed the food I cannot come here too often. Fried food, smothered in gravy makes it into the rotation every few weeks. I'm looking forward to trying the red velvet cake next time.  The music in the restaurant is better than what they play on the radio, a good mix of dusties with some new stuff. I anxiously await our next visit to Lo-Lo's.

Food was delicious! Unfortunately, I woke up with a migraine the next morning which lasted allllll daaaaay looooong. Another yelper mentioned something about MSG. I decided to try Thai E-San anyway....hindsight is 20/20.  This review is not because of the food or customer service, I'm just super sensitive to food additives.

VbXy3tH5RAu7HjT7VeMMgA
I can admit when I'm wrong. Someone from Thai E-San responded to my previous yelp review informing me that MSG is not used in their food and to give them another try. Well, a couple of weeks ago I placed an order for pick up and did NOT have a headache the next morning.   The reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because my order was wrong. I will continue to dine here, but when picking up an order I will open the bag and look inside.

Bait and switch.   The menu that is online is not the same menu that is in the restaurant. The online menu lists several vegetarian dishes, the restaurant menu does not.   When my sister and I arrived we each knew what we were going to order, but did not see those dishes on the menu. Plan B: she went with a lemon grass beef dish with rice. I reluctantly ordered the chicken noodle soup. I had them swap out the chicken and replace it shrimp. I should have known better, but I was hungry and not think clearly.  Later that afternoon I became queasy and threw up. I do not believe I became sick because the food was bad, I think it was because of the chicken broth. It's been a while since I've eaten meat and the chicken broth did not agree with me.  Now to be nit picky, the chairs are hard and uncomfortable. The waitress was a bit odd, she kept steering diners away from a particular table saying it was because she just lit some incense. My sister and I watched her tell 4 diners they could not sit there then a lone man comes in and sits there. Favoritism at the Viet Kitchen??  Do not go here if you are vegetarian, vegan, prefer a table up front or dislike hard chairs.

I don't typically like chains, in fact I avoid them, but a co-worker raved about a Babbo salad. The roasted beet & brussel sprout salad with goat cheese is outstanding. My husband and I split the salad, next time we will each get our own. I ordered a pasta dish with a shrimp which was also good. They give you an ample amount of shrimp which is not the norm for most restaurants.   The 5 stars is for the salad. Overall, I would give Babbo 3 stars.

I've been wanting to try this place for months, but forgot about it. Fortunately, I was watching Check Please and The Main Ingredient was featured.   Delicious artichoke dip. I am not sure what cheese they use, but it works. My hubby & I almost went to battle over who would get the last of it.  Veggie quesadilla was pretty good. I would like more variety of veggies added to it.  Mac & cheese was different. I'm used to the creamy type and this ain't it. It's more like a macaroni loaf.   Music was phenomenal. Digiable Planets, Al Green and De La Soul. We'll return for the artichoke dip and the music for sure.

I agree with everyone that gave this place 1 star. We used them at the end of April while visiting Phoenix and didn't have any problems so we decided to use them again last week.   We were only going to be in town for 2 days so the estimated cost was $160 for a mid size. When we get to the rental desk the agent tries to upsell us on a convertible. It's mid August in PHOENIX, ARIZONA and he wants us to drive off in a freaking convertible. So after he adds me as a driver and tacks on the insurance the total comes to $391!!!!!!!!!! A mid size car for 2 days and you're going to charge us $391!!!!!!! We asked what time do we need to return the car on Thursday before being charged an extra day. He seemed bothered, but he said 12:45. We also went with the basic insurance.   We returned the car at 12:40 with a full tank of gas. Our total was $191.00  If after reading this review and all the other negative reviews you still decide to rent from Thrifty, read the fine print and have the agent explain to you what you are being charged and why.

Here's what $50 (including tip) will get you at The Grind:  2 burgers (1 turkey, 1 sweet & spicy) 1 order of half & half fries 1 grilled asparagus & goat cheese salad w/ marinated lemons 1 lemonade  The burger was pretty good. The salad was outstanding. The 4 stars are for the salad. I'll be back for the salad.....can you tell I really liked the salad?!

My sister and I picked up lunch Saturday. We got 2 bacon double cheeseburgers and 1 large fry, the total was $20. The burger was worth every penny. They have a wide variety of toppings and the burger is made when you order it.   The burger & fries were so filling that I skipped dinner that night and fell asleep shortly after I ate. I'll be back....not too soon though.

I heard about this place while watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. My expectations  were high and I'm glad to say I was not disappointed. We've been in Phoenix for almost 5 months and have been on a mission to find a good taco joint. Not a taco restaurant, but a taco joint and we found it at Los Taquitos.   I ordered the street taco meal: 2 carne asada and 1 chicken. The carne asada was seasoned well, the chicken needed a little more flavor and was a wee bit dry. The rice & beans were good and were not an afterthought. My husband also got the street taco meal, but instead of chicken he got the fish taco. He liked the fish, but said he would get 3 carne asada next time.   The street tacos were a little in the small side, I don't know if there is another type besides street tacos that are a little bigger. We dined in and it would have been nice to have a complimentary basket of chips & salsa while we waited for our meal.  We live about 15 minutes away, but will make the trip again very soon. I'm looking forward to trying the Bombaro.

We planned on going to a Touch of Thai which was located next door. That restaurant went out of business so we ended up here.   I ordered the chicken curry with carrots & potatoes with an eggroll. My husband went with the combo fried fried rice. The chicken curry had very little sauce and the potatoes were crunchy. The eggroll lacked flavor. My husband liked his fried rice, I don't know why. The entire meal lacked flavor, I could have had a tastier meal at Panda Express.

The atmosphere, the service and the food were are all fantastic!! We were there last Tuesday and the weather was still cool outside. You walk inside and there is a cozy, inviting fireplace.   We took the recommendation of our waiter and started with the goat cheese & artichoke flat bread. It was so thin & crispy with the right amount of toppings that did not weigh it down. I had the mesquite grilled garlic shrimp that came with polenta and asparagus. The shrimp were topped with some sort of diced, cured meat and green olives. I don't eat meat so I picked it out. The olives added a nice saltiness. If you are on a low sodium diet I would not recommend this dish. My husband had the steak & scallops, it wasn't on the menu but our fabulous waiter told us about it.   We finished off the meal with a pecan pie mousse and a key lime pie, both were delicious and very, very sweet.  I love that Seasons does not have fried food on the menu, all dishes are less than 250 calories and they offer a wide variety of seasonal and vegetarian dishes. I look forward to the spring menu.

Since moving here I've been searching for an authentic taco joint that reminds me of Chicago....look no more. Cheap, delicious street tacos. Our meal arrived with a side of grilled onions and jalapenos and plenty of lime wedges.  Fish tacos-Fantastic and not at all skimpy on the fish. Memelitas-Fantastic. It's like a mini, thick corn tortilla topped with beans, cheese, cilantro and onions. I don't eat meat, but you could get meat if you want. Quesadilla-Fantastic. Corn tortilla stuffed with cheese and herbs, fried, then topped with blacks beans, cheese & lettuce.  Aside from loving the food I liked the owner and the extremely versatile customers. I also like to support local businesses.

Is it possible to be in love with a fish sandwich?  I highly recommend the Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich paired with the chopped kale salad. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. My husband got the porkwich. I guess if you're gonna get pork then go all out with this one. It was good, but it was no Banh Mi White Fish Sandwich.  Go next door to Churn when you're done and support local businesses.  The only cons I have is the parking situation and the loud music. There are so few parking spots and they go quickly. I assume staff takes most of the spots which leaves valet. I have no problem paying for parking, but I don't feel like I have a choice.

This review is for the 7th street location. Last year my we dined at the Greenway Parkway location in Scottsdale and did not enjoy it.  Okay, so not wanting to cook or grill on Memorial Day my husband & I decided to go out. The restaurant that we went to first had a small parking lot with no spaces left. The restaurant that we went to second was packed with only outdoor seating. So, the universe must have wanted us to try Humble Pie again and I'm glad we did. My husband had the mushroom pizza, he added sausage to it and said it was better than The Parlor. I ordered the grilled provolone tuna sandwich which was outstanding. It's a wee bit salty, but I like salty.  I was debating whether or not to deduct a star because of the subpar service we received from our waitress. No smile. No refills on water. No questions regarding our meal.

Shortly after I bought my car I want on Yelp to find the best window tinters. Eclipse has ALL 5 star reviews......that hardly happens. I can't  remember the man's name who came out, but he was prompt and efficient. Within 50 minutes my windows were tinted. Great work, fast service and excellent price. Fyi: there is a small discount if you pay in cash:)

My sister and I went today for brow waxes. The establishment is spotless. Cleanliness is really important to me. My esthetician was Alexandra. She was very professional and explained everything she did before she did it. I've had many waxes and know the procedure, but it was a nice touch.   When we arrived for our appointments we were told about their package prices. I'm a pay-as-you-go type person so I declined. It was not a hard sell and I really appreciated that. I made a follow up appointment in 2 weeks.

I've been to the Tempe location and when I found out the other location is near my house I was overjoyed!!! However, I am not overjoyed about the teeny weeny parking lot. Once the employees park their cars there are too far spots left. Because of the lack of parking we ordered take out. My husband who really enjoys meat loved the food here.   Eggless egg rolls-thumbs up Samosas-thumbs up Lemon pesto w/ chicken-thumbs WAY up Mixed green salad w/ chicken-thumbs WAY up Buffalo wings-thumbs up BBQ bacon burger-thumbs up  Can't wait to go again.

My sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and I went yesterday. This place is really nice! I'm not much of a drinker, but the bar was impressive.   We were the first of 6 people to arrive for the afternoon showing of The Immortals. The movie was nothing to write home about, however the theater is. The seats are roomy and comfy with a tray for food that slides back & forth. It would have been nice if the seats reclined more. I ordered the popcorn which was buttery, salty and yummmmmy:)   I took 1 star away because the volume was crazy-loud. I anticipate the volume being loud which is why I always bring earphones to the movie. It was still so loud that I couldn't hear the sarcastic comments I was making in my head about Micky Rouke.

This is the poor mans Paradise Bakery. Sandwiches are 95% bread and my Thai lobster curry soup was missing the lobster. It took all my energy not to ask for refund.

Wonderful place. The interior is charming and the owner/waitress/whoever she is was friendly and inviting.  Seared kale, green beans, beets & sweet potato salad with basil goat cheese is out of this world. For vegans the goat cheese can be switched out for hummus. This salad is extremely large and extremely delicious. My husband ordered the stuffed French toast that came with 2 slices of bacon. The French toast was scrumptious. I asked our waitress about the tempeh and she brought us a decent size piece for us to try.   There is something on the menu for everyone. I look forward to returning.

I made an appointment for a mammogram. I arrived 10 minutes before my appointment to fill out paperwork. When I walked in there were at least 15 people in the waiting area....not a good sign.  My name was promptly called at 8:30. I was brought back to the changing room and then to the exam room. By 8:50 I was back in my car headed home. I will always go here for my mammograms.

The fruit/veggie selection is pretty good.   The bulk selection is fantastic.   Don't get the fresh fish, it's not all that fresh.......lesson learned the hard way.  The prices are lower than Sprouts, Fresh & Easy, Fry's, Basha's and Safeway.

I don't eat meat so I probably shouldn't have gone here. My husband got the "Arizona" burger and really enjoyed it. I went with the vegetarian burger which is basically black beans smashed together. I do like black beans, but I don't like black beans with mustard, pickles and onion on top of a bun. I enjoyed the rosemary & olive oil fries, but not enough for me to come back a second time.  Our total was $15.00 and that was not money well spent.

I highly recommend Susan Phelan. She will work her butt off to find you the perfect home. She is extremely knowledgeable about houses, landscaping, roofing, plumbing, etc. and she knows all the right people.

I was there last week for jury duty. Regardless of how happy the people on the videos look, it still sucks. The waiting area is extremely large with comfortable seating and tv monitors everywhere. Bring a book, music, snacks and settle in for what could be a long day.

I've been twice.....so far and enjoyed my meal each time. The burrata is outstanding. The pizza is to die for. The 3 berry cobbler is killer. The music is memorable (Zeppelin, Run DMC, Beastie Boys).   Can't wait to go back.

Initially, I was going to take my car to another place but the wait was too long. I used yelp to find another place nearby. There is not a lot to say. This place is close to home, fast and cheap.

We here last night for dinner. My friend picked this place because she knows I'm gluten free and vegetarian. Fortunately there were plenty of dishes for me to choose from. I ordered the salmon entree which came with mashed potatoes and roasted mixed veggies. The food was excellent! Our server was excellent! I took a star away because the size of my fish was small. For $18 I want an actual fillet not half a fillet. I will go back but not for the fish.

I know next to nothing about cars and car repair so my husband handles these matters, but I do tag along in the hopes of learning a thing or two. The a/c in my car worked fine last summer, but suddenly stopped. We met with Russ who was friendly and welcoming. He called us a few hours later to explain the problem and the cost. When we returned to pick up the car he showed us the piece that was worn away and causing the lack of cool air. This place is honest and we will return in the future.

I've been wanting to go here since they first opened.....last year. I'm late in trying them, but better late then never. My husband surprised me today with the cutest box from French Grocery. Inside sat the most delicious coconut cake I've ever had. We both try to limit our sugar intake at night, but the cake is so good that it's worth a sleepless night. I literally cannot wait to devour the rest tomorrow so I can go and get another one or four.

Love this place!!!  A couple of clients recommended PLNS and I am so glad they did. This place is spotless, professional and friendly.   Christina did my mani/pedi and was meticulous. I am picky about my nails and cuticles and I didn't have to give her any direction. I will be returning soon and will be telling everyone I know about PLNS.  P.S. There is a slight discount if you pay in cash.

We checked in Thursday. There was a slight problem with our reservation. The computer showed that we booked the room in February and cancelled it 1 day later. Obviously, it was a mistake so for our trouble Marie upgraded us. Sweet:)  I'm sitting in our large room while my husband is sleeping soundly in the comfortable, king size bed. The hotel is clean and more modern than not.   Here are some useful hotel facts: * Starbucks is in the lobby (closes early Sat and closed on Sun) * Valet parking is $23 per day. * The on-site fitness is adequate if you do more cardio than lifting. There is a Gold's Gym about a block away. Show them your keycard and you can use their facility free of charge. * Free wifi. * Most restaurants in the area close early during the week and close completely on the weekend.  We are on the 18th floor and fortuantely, we don't have any neighbors or an adjoining door. Other reviewers have mentioned the paper thin walls, guess we got lucky cuz I'm a light sleeper and that would really annoy me.  Overall, pleasant experience and I'd stay here again.

The concept is a great. A restaurant/bar inside Whole Foods. I love Whole Foods, but not Twenty Highland Tavern.   We were here Sunday evening watching football. What goes well with football? Pizza. Well, they ran out of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese AND basil pesto. The only cheese they had for pizza was feta and cheddar jack. How does a restaurant/bar that is located inside a grocery store run out of anything?!?!?!  On top of being annoyed that they didn't have the necessary ingredients for a basic pizza, our waitress was an airhead. I asked 3 times for lemon wedges. When we were getting ready to pay she then asked how was my pizza? Duh.....I didn't get one.

I lived in Chicago for many years and never owned a car. You cannot make it far without a car in Arizona. We bought my first car off Craigslist for $4200, but this time around I wanted something nicer.  After researching several makes, models and dealerships my husband suggested we go here. We spent 10-20 minutes outside just looking at the various types of cars and the whole time I was looking over my shoulder waiting for used some car salesmen to pounce.....never happened. When we were ready we went inside and met with John. After test driving a car I decided I wanted to buy. John helped with all the paperwork and even got a lower APR then my bank was offering. Afterwards we met with Dale who went over warranties and finalized the deal. This is where things got interesting. My husband has been in sales for many years and dabbled a little in car sales at a dealership less than 2 blocks away up the street. I was more than happy to sit back and let my sweetie pie take charge. There are several warranty options available at different price points. My advice is never take the first, second or even third price being offered to you, 9 times out of 10 they can go lower. Long story short, I'm loving my new car and my husband even more for wheeling and dealing. We walked out with a car that I like at a price that we are more then comfortable with. Start to finish the whole process was 3.5 hours so bring a snack.

In love with this bakery especially the fudge brownies. The flax bread while quite good has oat flour. Unfortunately I have a sensitivity to oats so I will not be buying it again, but I will certainly be back for the brownies!!  If you get the loaf of bread call ahead and ask them to slice it for you. Bread is $8 and brownies are $4.

I've been at least 10 times and can't get enough. Garbanzo's is perfect for vegans & vegetarians. I always get the falafel wrap with lots of add ons. The falafel is always moist and fresh. The only thing that disappointed me is they got rid of the quinoa salad. I'm still a fan but miss that salad.

Went here for lunch today. Green Tea Noodle salad. I don't typically like cold noodles, but this was quite good. My husband started with the beet salad which was also quite good. For my main meal I ordered the chow mein with shrimp. Much to my delight it came with pieces of catfish and scallops. Yum! My husband got the pork something. I don't eat meat so I wasn't interested, but he liked it.  Restaurant is nicely decorated. The only thing that I didn't like was the smoke. The restaurant is an open floor plan so the kitchen is right there. Unfortunately, the smoke from the kitchen easily wafts throughout the entire restaurant. I just smelled my shirt and I still smell like food. Also, you can't get anything from the dinner menu at lunch so we will return for dinner to try that delicious looking shrimp & scallop appetizer.

I miss Dan. I didn't go all that often, but when I did Dan always knew my order. It's nice feeling like a regular, he made me feel at home.  That being said, the fish tacos are still the best and I will continue to go.

While the food is tasty I feel like I'm being ripped off. Blackened fish tacos came with 90% pico de gallo and 10% fish. That is NO exaggeration. Doesn't matter how much I like the salsas I refuse to spend another dime at an establishment that is intentionally ripping people off.   Wtf Urban Taco?!?!

I've been in the market for an elliptical for a while. Normally I'm an impulse buyer, but decided to take my time and do my homework before making a purchase. I went to other stores in the valley and was not impressed with the inventory and then I came across 2nd Wind. The salesman who helped me was Adrian. He was not only knowledgeable but professional as well. I had no idea there were so many types of ellipticals to chose from. I thought ellipticals were a one size fits all kinda of thing but I was wrong. I don't know when I'll buy exercise equipment again, but I know where I will go.

I'm confused by the negative reviews. This place is awesome. OPI and Essie nail polishes are super cheap. I don't buy hair care products here, but I know it's at a discounted price. I can't wait to go again!!

My sister and I stumbled upon The Pie Hole over the summer. We each had a savory pie: mine had sun dried tomato, feta and another ingredient which escapes my mind right now. The crust was very good. The inside of the pie had great flavor, but the pie needed WAY more filling.   I decided to take a chance and preorder an apple pie for Thanksgiving. The pie was very good. Buttery, flaky crust with a sweet cinnamony apple filling. My husband liked the fact that the filling was not syrupy sweet. I'm going to order a peach pie for Christmas. I'm sure it'll be just as good if not better than the apple.   I like to support local businesses especially those owned and run by women so I'll tell everyone I know to check out The Pie Hole.

I never thought about going to a Sauce restaurant until they opened one down the street for my house. I had the arugula and quinoa salad with goat cheese.....lots of yummy delicious goat cheese. My husband had the kale and salmon salad. The salmon was broken into small pieces instead of whole. I think it's because they could skimp on the salmon and you'll never know the difference. We each had a piece of artichoke, mushroom, roasted red pepper & goat cheese bruschetta. Everything taste delicious. Our total for dinner plus a glass of red wine was $32. We didn't know fresh bread came with the salad, we'll probably skip the bruschetta next time and just eat the bread. The table next to us ordered pizza. The crust looked super thin and short on toppings. Being from Chicago I'm picky about pizza. That being said, I'm not in love with deep dish, but I like a substantial slice. I'll try for myself next time.  Sauce is VERY, VERY kid friendly. If kids are not your thing (they are not mine) then I would go later in the evening or for lunch. Babies screaming in the line. Kids running around the outside patio. Little girls making a mess at the self serve beverage bar. All in all, a pleasant experience and we will return.....for lunch or when it is past the kids bed time.

I am very excited to welcome Flower Child to central Phoenix. I love that the menu has something for everyone especially vegetarian and vegans.  I ordered the minestrone with kale & quinoa. Excellent!! I also ordered the masala curry bowl with tofu. Excellent!! I don't usually like raisins mixed in with my food but the sweetness complimented the dish very well.   My husband ordered the chicken coconut soup. I don't eat meat so I didn't taste it, but he liked it. He ordered a Thai, quinoa bowl with steak. Fortunately the steak didn't touch everything so I was able to taste it. Yum!!! I'll get that dish next time.  2 soups, 2 entrees with protein added and 1 lemonade=$46.   The staff was attentive and friendly. The customer base was a nice mix. This place reminded me of True Food minus all the "pretty people." There are a lot of items I want to try so I will be back.

I've been composing this review in my head ever since it was first announced that Lou Malnati's was coming to Phoenix. Being from Chicago I've eaten Lou's from several locations: River North on Wells Street, Gold Coast on State Street, Naperville, IL, Carol Stream, IL and the Bucktown location. I am thrilled to say that the Phoenix pizza is JUST AS GOOD AS THE CHICAGO locations!!!!!   I recently discovered that I have an intolerance to gluten. I was prepared to suffer week long stomach pain for this pizza when my sister suggested I check the website to see if GF options are available. THANK YOU GOD!!!!! For that simple fact alone you deserve 10 stars. I no longer eat meat and found my onion and garlic pizza just as delicious as a sausage or pepperoni. The tomatoes and cheese were top notch as usual.  Moving to Phoenix several years ago I've been homesick for many types of food, pizza just one of them. Every year since moving here my husband and I would ship Lou Malnati's pizza for our Christmas dinner. For me it's not just about the pizza, it actually feels like a part of home is in Central Phoenix and I can't thank you enough.

I cannot actually review the service because my phone call went unreturned. I left a voicemail for Adreanna last Wednesday asking for an appointment for a basic manicure for the next week. It's Monday and I'm still waiting for a call back. I've been in the customer service industry for many years and the service starts before ever setting foot in the door. I hope business is going so well for this place that they can afford to turn away a potential regular.

I have a regular nail salon that I go to which is 15 minutes from my house. In the back of my mind I'm always on the look out for something closer to home. A client told me about Anna's which is 5 minutes from my house. I went in today for a mani/pedi. I didn't have an appointment and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. 10 minutes later my feet are soaking in warm sudsy water. My nail tech was Jason. I have to admit I don't love having a guy work on my nails, but Jason was fantastic. Quick and precise and quiet!!! I use this time to zone out and don't want to make small talk so Jason was perfect for that. I will make an appointment next time and I will ask for Jason. Regular mani/pedi is $32. FYI, tip in cash.

Okay so Pita Jungle opened Jan. 18th and I've been twice in one week. The first time my husband and I went for lunch. The place was packed!! The decor is very nice and modern. I only have one issue regarding the decor. No one factored in where a lady would place her purse while dining. The chairs don't have a typical back where a purse can hang on the side and there are no wall hooks so I was forced to place my purse on the floor. Please fix this problem. Thank you:)  Husband and I each ordered a cup of coconut curry soup. While tasty it was warm not hot. We were disappointed with the soup. For my entree I went with the salmon burger. FANTASTIC!!! The patty was well seasoned, moist and delicious. It took quite a while for our food to arrive, to make up for the long wait they gave us a complimentary dessert. The carrot cake is so good. I've had it before and it never disappoints me.  Today's visit was again at lunch time. The Friday crowd is different from the Tuesday crowd. LOTS of mommies with babies and little kids. I'm not a kid person so I tend to notice things like that. I ordered the entree red quinoa salad with mixed greens and jalapeno cilantro hummus. The salad was delicious. Since it was listed under entrees I thought the portion would have been bigger. Also, since red quinoa is the name of the salad you would think there would be a lot of quinoa, not the case. Surprisingly little quinoa in this salad. My girlfriend ordered the same salad, but she got chicken with hers so her meal was more substantial then mine. I would get that salad again and soup to go with it so long as it's hot.  All in all a pleasant experience each time. There are some kinks that still need to be worked out with a new staff. I have no doubt in a short time they will be running like a well oiled machine. I have to give a special shout out to Kayla who was my waitress both times and both times she was outstanding. I love forward to returning.
