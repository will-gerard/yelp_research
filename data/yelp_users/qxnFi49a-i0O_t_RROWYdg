I don't know why we waited so long to go back to Phoenix City Grill!! It's been close to 2 yrs and we really liked it the first time we were there. It's even better than we remembered!!!   I tried the mandarin mule drink and loved it. very refreshing!!! The green chile queso was yummy!!! Hubby had a chicken dish and I had the short rib special. Um...we will be back!!!!!

Has any and every sales person NOT seen Pretty Woman?!?!  Sorry my husband and I don't dress to impress when we shop for furniture.  We wrote off the Fashion Square location a few years ago for the same reason.  We have spent TONS of money with you in the past and will no longer even step into your stores.  We are the easiest customers.  We walk in knowing what we want and wanting to buy it that day.   Today no one greeted us when we walked in.  Sales lady went out of her way to ask the cute family if they needed help.  The wife was wearing a flowery dress and husband wearing his khakis and button up shirt....must mean they are loaded.  Right? I was wearing my torn up Levi's with a baseball hat and my hubby in shorts and Steelers shirt....oh, he has a shaved and goatee.  We must've come from off the street.  Sales lady looked us up and down and walked away.  We laughed and left the store.   Lost a large sale today, again. Peace out Pottery Barn.

Amazing customer service! Super friendly and helpful.  Beautiful furniture with pretty  reasonable price tags. We were shocked! Found our Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel replacement

I would have given 5 stars but the night we  went here dinner service was very slow.  Our table hardly noticed because we were enjoying apps, drinks and conversation. The party of 8 next to us looked like they wanted murder us because our dinner came out before theirs!!! We were entertained by their anger. Other than that, food was great! Lemon drop martinis...yum.

I love living closer to central Phoenix!!!  Restaurants are so much better over here!  I had tried Barrio Queen in Scottsdale a few times before getting to the Cafe.  Totally different atmospheres! Love both! Table side guacamole is a must at both locations.  I always get the cochinita pibil and a couple margaritas but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!

I think I have been going here for about 3 yrs.  Dolce has an unbelievable membership program! Great deals on services and products! Hadley takes care of my face and she is the best!  Helps keep pimples away and has the best 90 min facial ever!

Love! Love! Love!!!!!! So charming! EVERYTHING was AMAZING!! A group of us tried pretty much everything on the menu and every plate was licked clean.  The fried cheese curds were my fave.  I also found a new favorite local wine! Dos Cabezas red wine : )

I have loved this place in the past!  Especially for the breakfast burritos.  The past few times I've tried to go when they first open, well, they're never open on time!!  Yelp page says they open at 10:30 and we were just there at 11:05. Closed.  I had called last week to place a pick up order just before 11 o'clock and the girl that answered said they wouldn't be opening until 11:15.  11:15????? That's at an odd time for a restaurant to open.  How about take my pickup order and tell me it will be ready at 11:15. Instead, I was a huge bother to the girl on the other line because I called before 11:15.  I'll take my business somewhere else.

I love when I try a restaurant and love it so much that I start planning my next visit before I leave!!! We got there around 9pm Monday night and they had an awesome happy hour going on! Already off to an awesome start!!!! We started with the meat and chz app.  I loved the variety on the plate!   All of the sandwich options sounded so stinkin good!!! So hard to decide! Finally, I decided on the roast beef and cheese and the hubby got the grilled chz option.  Both were to die for! Yum! I can't wait until the weather gets nicer so we can sit on the patio and bring one of our pups.  Even with the summer nights the patio was packed tho!  I loved TMI!

Always a good time at Stand Up Live!!!!! Copper Blues is a great place to hang before or/and after the show.   Love the food and drinks.  MACARONI!!!!!!! Mmmmmmmm. I've seen sooooo many amazing comedians!  Always feels good to laugh : ) 1 or 2 not so funny comedians but not everyone is going to be your cup of tea. Pablo Francisco, Jim Breuer and Dana Carvey were amazeballs!!!!

Youfit seemed like a great idea but like a previous reviewer said, it gets boring!  Needs to have classes as an option.  Nobody follows the rules in the Circuit workout area.  Drives me nuts.  Went to cancel this month, December, and noticed i was charged $29 for the next year's maintenance fees and $25 cancellation fee. I asked if I could be refunded the maintenance fees because I shouldn't help pay for next year's maintenance if I'm no longer a member and canceling before the next year starts!!  They told me they need a 10 day notice before a charge is made to your card to be refunded. What?!?!? Sorry I don't have my crystal ball with me to warn me when you are going to charge me a hidden fee!!!!  Boooooo Youfit!!!!  Good riddance!!!!!!

Loud. Couldn't hear the people we were with. Food. Meh. Service was strange. In a hurry to give us our check when we were ordering everything on the menu!!! We weren't campers! We were spending lots of money! We all agreed we would never be going back to Searsucker. Also, our friend Jim is no longer allowed to pick restaurants.

Great breakfast joint! The staff was awesome...almost too nice!  Breakfast nachos are insane!!!!!!  Have been a few times and haven't been disappointed once.  Definitely worth a try.

I haven't been there on a weekend night yet.  I haven't heard too many good things from friends when it's crowded.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside because the weather was amazing!!! Everything was really pleasant.  I got their spin on the margarita....ok I had 3. I obviously loved it.  My friend and I got the pretzel appetizer.  Pretzels were super soft and chewy. Mmmmmm.  Husband showed up and got ahi salad and seemed to enjoy it judging by the licked clean plate.  I will be back!! Hopefully have enough peeps to play some games!

Best steak I've ever had!!!!! Great build out.  Beautifully decorated. Previously, BLT Steakhouse and LG's in Palm Springs were our faves.   We sat towards the back by the kitchen where it might be a little more private and quiet than the front of the restaurant.  Great service. Great drinks...$14 drink that actually gave me a nice buzzzzzzz.  The bread that comes out was fan flippin tastic!!!!!! Be careful not to eat any more than 2 pieces of the bread or u will ruin your dinner!!! I went with 8oz filet med well and it was so perfect and tender.  All sides were yummy.  Asparagus fries were a nice surprise.  Mmmmmmm. We will be back soon!

Just not good.  The few times I went I gazed longingly across the street at The Garage...where the food is actually good and I'm not pissed when the check comes to the table.

Correct me if I'm wrong!  Taco Guild is brought to you by Z'Tejas!! Explains a lot.  I knew I recognized those cheap weird chips!!!!!  Tacos were just ok. I may go back for just drinks hold the chips and salsa.  The place is so stinkin cool it's a shame the food doesn't do it any justice.

First off, I nearly passed out when my hubby agreed to try this with me!!! We absolutely loved it and have been back many times since!  Dina is so fun and has a great sense of humor. We love her! I've had a friends 40th bday party here, mom's bday, and a bridal shower here in the past month.  Everyone has loved it!!!!! Being able to bring your own drinks doesn't hurt either!!

I gotta stop going to this place!!! It's not that good anymore!!! When it was just the original 2 locations I enjoyed it and never had any complaints. This location gets my online orders wrong 100% of the time and every time it's  just not that good.  Chips are always stale. Beans taste funky sometimes.  The cheese is different now too. Boo.

Nekter is the most convenient juice location for me.  Everything they offer is really good but have had better at other juice joints.  I struggle with 4 or 3 star rating a little. The wait is sometimes ridiculous!!!! If management reads this...PLEASE clean your restroom!!! It always looks gross!!!!  The seat looks like it might be stained with pee because that spot hasn't changed since I've been going here. Makes me second guess how clean other areas in the back are.

Best juice cleanse I've ever done!  I did the option that lets you have the kale salad with quinoa for dinner.  3 day cleanse.  That salad is amazing!!!!  I loved all the juices...I subbed out the juice that had the beets. Friendly and helpful staff always is a bonus!

Totally shocked by all the great reviews.  My husband and I both thought it tasted like cafeteria food.  After our first few bites of pizza, we  decided to text each other at the same time what it reminded us of.   I sent that it reminded me if Totinos frozen pizza and my husband thought it tasted like Digiorno pizza.  We had a laugh. The cheese app tasted like soap or rubbing alcohol and the pita was nothing fabulous.   We love all of the new restaurant popping up!  Not this one.
