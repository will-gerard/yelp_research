I pass this place all the time, and decided to stop in today. Glad I did! I got the classic gyro with fries, and it was one of the best I've had.   The service is very friendly, and they are attentive. You could tell the ingredients are high quality, and my food was very fresh.   The establishment was very clean, with friendly service and good food. You should check it out!

I stop in from time to time for fresh stems for the house.  The flowers are fresh and high quality, and the staff is very friendly.  They will stop what they are doing to come and help me out with the selection process every time (even though it's typically a low dollar purchase) - Tip: Fridays are half off day for floral stems.  I don't send arrangements all that often, but the next time I do so in Phoenix, it will be from Phoenix Flower Shops!

The fries are amazing! Hope you aren't expecting a good burger though. They have obscenely tough breads and normally come out overcooked. Not only are they hard to eat, but they are overly buttery and not all that flavorful. The double stack from wendy's is tastier every time...

I just tried this place for the first time and WOW! Great food!  I got the gyro combo, and every single bit was awesome.  I will definitely be back.

What a treat!  I've been meaning to check this place out for sometime now, and I am so glad that I did.  The casual counter service style is nothing new to me, however, I am going to caution anyone that is in the mood for full service that you do not get that here.  Place your order, then grab your drink and set ups and find a cozy seat, and you're all set.  I had the Chilaquiles Verdes and boy-oh-boy was this dish tasty. The fresh ingredients are apparent in the flavors going on, and the green chili sauce was the best I may have ever had.  Tried the coffee cake too, and it was great - just the right amount of cherry flavor.  The only reason that the place didn't get five stars was the rather indifferent service rendered by the gentleman behind the counter.  When you are in a great mood and looking forward to a good meal, a stoic stone faced greeting kind of detracts from this a bit.  (sorry, just my thoughts on the matter).  That being said I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.

So... How does an automotive place get five stars? I came in for several (4) different items on an 06 Sentra. (AC Actuator, Transmission service, power window motor replacement, and oil change) I knew what the approximate cost of most of this should be, based on other quotes, and their quote was actually significantly less!  Besides price, scheduling is also a concern for me.  They were extremely accommodating, and I was able to get -mostly- everything done in one trip (mind you, this was a bunch of random different stuff).  I did have to make one more trip in to finish everything because one part was not available that day, HOWEVER, I was told to bring my car back anytime at my next convenience to finish everything.  I had an extra 45 minutes on my way home from work two days later, right around their closing time, and they totally finished the job right then and there - I was so impressed.   This place has friendly accommodating staff, great prices, and the ability to get you fixed up on your schedule.  What else can you ask for?

I ordered a delivery for that special someone on Valentine's Day. Lisa took my order and she was great, very consultative. (Helped me get something unique, appropriate, and in my desired budget) The arrangement arrived later than I'd have preferred, but within the window promised (no concerns there), AND it looked beautiful!    The next morning unfortunately, some of the flowers had wilted considerably. I spoke with Lisa about the problem and she was both apologetic and emphatic about improving my experience, and she insisted on sending a replacement arrangement.  I didn't think it was possible but the replacement was even more beautiful and fragrant, and with none of the wilting issues - so I have to assume that was a fluke.   Bottom line - If you are looking for top quality flowers, expertly arranged, from a business with real pride in the product and excellent customer service, this is your place! I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer.
