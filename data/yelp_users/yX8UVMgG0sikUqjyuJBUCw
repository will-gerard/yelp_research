BE CAREFUL EVERYBODY!!! After Tracy's left this place this place is going down.  One year after their "professional painting",same area is peeling off.... OWNER Mr. Wang refuse to repair it. Also told customer "Stop lying".  Mr Wang.You need to learn what is the customer service.  Your job is taking care of your customer.    Customer is lying? Is that all you can say?Just a peeling off paint .It is not worth to lie. Grow up!!   If you can't repair it, that's fine. There is many collision center in Phoenix.   You don't need any offensive language to your customer.  If people bring back their vehicle to you , don't panic!

Tried Sushi Ken for more than 10 times, I love their sushi(Rainbow roll,Dragon Roll) and Ramen! Great family restaurant,I have to say this is a slam dunk 5 stars.  Japanese owner run this business, absolutely authentic Japanese Sushi.Green-Tea Tempera ice cream is the best,make sure you order  that for your desert.    Tip: Always crowed Friday& Saturday night ,better to get your table is call them for a reservation.
