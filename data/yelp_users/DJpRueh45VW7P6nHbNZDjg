Cheers is one of the most excellent places I've been too. Some may not find it glamorous enough, full enough, or friendly enough, but its just the right touch of everything.  If you're good to the bartenders, they're good to you. I go there fairly regularly, and once they get to know your face they'll give you great drink specials. I suppose it would be considered a "dive" bar, but its fun for my friends and I.   No complaints, Cheers is excellent.

Its about time this place got put on blast.  If you go to this venue for one of their events, in my case "What Happened Wednesday?", you will be severely disappointed. Repping drink specials at $3 for well drinks, draft, and bottled beers, you couldn't really go wrong. Until it comes to the point of closing your tab. When I did go to check out, I was charged nearly $30 for a 3 drink tab. If we all get our math done correctly, this comes to around $9. Unfortunately for everyone in the place, you happened to select a drink where if you're a pretty girl, you're charged $3. Otherwise, you're coughing up $9 a pop. Not to mention that you're charged for a drink you didn't even purchase (I was charged for 4 drinks, and only purchased 3).  I'm not one to complain about rip-offs, if you go to a bar normally you should know what to expect. But this was RIDICULOUS. My only advice, ask a bartender how much you are going to be charged for a drink before you order it. I may sound cheap, but I'd at least like to know what I'm paying for.   1 star for being a joke of a bar.

Being the post-apocalyptic disaster my front and backyards were, I expected to be shelling out a lot of cash for a cleanup.  Not only did AMS have the best price (I checked with 3 other companies), they did an amazing job for the cheapest, and even cleaned up the back alley I hadn't even thought about. Eli was incredibly prompt at returning emails and setting up an appointment, and was even great about helping me with a payment option that suited me best. I'll definitely be using their service again in the future.

I don't even want to give one star for this.  Just moved to Tempe and was really excited to find a pho restaurant so close. Was a little weirded out, nobody was there on a Friday night. Waiter was nice and we ordered 3 bowls of pho and I got a smoothie.  Smoothie was made with expired ROTTEN milk, the waiter said "Oh, well I smelled it to check if it was okay and it seemed fine." He said I wouldn't have to pay for it so I ordered a drink from the bar instead. Took a peek in there and found a nice live bug floating around on top.   At this point we were all sick to our stomachs, didn't eat any of the pho they brought out because who knows what is floating around in there. I told the waiter about the bug, he sighed and said "Oh fuck". I just told him we were leaving and we still got charged for the pho we didn't eat.  All around terrible experience. Got to hold my sister's hair as she threw up from disgust when we got home! Thanks Pho Cao!
