This is my absolute favorite, go to place. Great prices, amazing food, friendly staff.  This place has it all, AND they are accommodating to kids without being a "kid place".  If you go you have to get the Bruschetta.  It's from heaven!

I've had the same awful problem using my Groupon.  Kashmir will not answer their phone, will not return calls, and now will not honor an unexpired groupon.  It's a shame, they lost a customer before I even walked in the door.  And you can bet I will tell all my friends about this horrible spa and their extreme lack of customer service!!
