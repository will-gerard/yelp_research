I love KOs !  Patio dIning is the best,  Fire Pit , flat screens and misters. Great selection of beers and excellent nachos.  Friendly Service and Very Relaxing place to chill out.  The view is lacking to streets or parking lot, so just enjoy the company you are with.

Good breakfast burger but I still think lumberyard has a better one . Good brews here and great breakfast scramble too served with fresh fruit . It's a little dark in here but it's still lively . I say come in and make your judgement :)

I frequent this place for the BEER and the patio setting when the weather is good. This is a touristy place but I living so close its very convenient. The staff is friendly and the service is good. The on-site Brewery is awesome, they even make their own root beer too. The food is just ok for me, the salads have little flavor and the chicken sandwich is much like a school cafeteria might hand you . The Ribs and onion rings are Yummmmy and the jalapeno poppers. I like fries not ruffles potato chips, but oh well. The beer is really the hit here, and the ambiance of course. I might try the roasted chicken next.  I wish there was something unfried on the appetizer menu.

Fun Fun Fun if you like Rodeo!! I do!! I did not know I did but AH DOO :) Hee hee, very exciting..4 starts to the Cowboys and Bulls and 3 Stars for the food, 2 stars for the drinks. BBQ Real good, thang is they weigh the portions of meat, I am down with that, cept, I had a bit of fat on my plate so I wasnt too happy about paying for a a few chunks of fat , they werent small neither..and the drinks look like they came out of its a small world..better of with a standard beer, in a bottle, those portions dont change. I laughed and asked "are these child size '?  tee hee hawwww

I truly believe that you are your own experience, if you are easy going you will have a fantastic experience, if you are finicky' then like mick jagger says you can't get no!! Satisfaction! But truly the staff and food are #1 in my opinion, engaging and entertaining all amounting to a dazzling evening from eye to mouth. FIrst visit a definite return for me :)

This place has delicious Mexican Food! margaritas are good too, not too sweet :) lots of friendly staff, and great service. I would not go there for Happy Hour though, they are only 1.00 off the Margaritas, and you can only sit at the bar area; if its hot hot you have only half the bar available, the indoor side, But for lunch n dinner GREAT!

This place has an amazing selection of BEER! too many to choose from,but thats nothing to complain about, there is something there for everyone. Ya the beer is overpiced and the food is too. The ambience is great though and has a lively up beat feeling inside so it makes you feel good right away, a nice place to eat while the kids prefer too stroll around the mall or see a movie. I would definately go back :)

Well, the beer selection definatelly lacks here! the burgers are tasty but again served with potato chips and not fries :(  the billiards need servicing and half the video machines are broken. They keep odd hours so its very hard to predict when they are going to be open.  Friendly staff and nice outdoor scene with some lively music.

I was a member of Golds Gyam Simi Valley, Ca. for years, I moved to AZ a month ago and wanted to continue my membership with Golds here. I was extreemly shocked as to how dated the facility looked. no flat screens , horrible ventillation, old equipment with crackeling material. I stayed on as I was told I would not have to put a down payment and they took 5.00 off my membership. When I find a job and resume a steady income out here I am moving on sad to say.

Come one come all.. You can't beat this place on brews and food its on my top 3 list of brew pubs .. Your eyes will roll back when you taste the burgers and you will have to pick your self off the floor with their  craft brews literally . But you must regain consciousness to get the full effect .. It's not like inception you will get it the first time not the 5th

This place has made some positive changes . The food and drink choices are good and the wings are a super plus with a decent blue cheese burger even I would come back for .. Mm. Lots of tv sports going on and the service is good .. Did I say that already .. And a cool water fountain on the patio. Music at the right  volume to chat .

Simply delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 but get there while the gettin is good, cause its so good they run out sometimes. WOWee is all I can say, superb BBQ, made me wanna stop there everytime I pass through. and the prices are very reasonable. Fantastic slow cooked savory BBQ, makes you want to eat the bones too. I dont really eat beef, but when I saw my BFs ribs I just had to try it, and then again... Satisfied Customer 100%

Why not stop for the best brat in town and enjoy the yard , games and atmosphere .. Choice of drinks is endless and if you love garlic fries so far the best in Az I have had . Aoli sauces are superb. It is a quaint place with that neighborhood get together atmosphere. They also host bbq parties .. Not cheap though but prob worth it. Would love to have my 50th here

I recently moved here from Toon North , I am pleased I stopped by, the view and ambiance was exactly what I wanted, the lunch menu had a great balance of naughty and nice . Service miss Vanda was fantastic polite and super attentive . I am definitely coming back. I am also interested to see what it's like when the sun goes down, how magical will it be? Hopefully find out soon .

Well we went in and it took about 6 min to get a menu sampled an ipa and the waiter never returned . Asked bar man if we could order from him and barman said we had to order from server so we waited and waited and finally we left , and on the way out the server says "thanks for coming in " what a dumb ass !

Go see Jim he is the best sales guy ever . Helped us furnish our new home . Lots of extra rooms. The place has great options for most styles and also some nice accessories and the mattresses are optimal . I can't wait to get my foam mattress and wow the prices are unbelievable . Make sure to ask for Jim . He will work with you on the best pricing

All I can say is wow ! If you at at the Venetian you got to come here . The swine burger is 100% belissimo .. Can't say enough my no. 1 fav burger ever even over the sunrise burger at lumberyard .. Sorry LBC they just stole it . Fine menu of local craft beers and the salads are optimal . They are a southern based culinary hangout chicken and waffles Mac n cheese but I'm tryin to be good here and split a burger and salad . As they go by I'm like wow that looks Delish !!! Deviled eggs are hit in this pace too and the green fried tomatoes ... Worth every cent all of it

Love the atmosphere .. Garden patio pet friendly too. The deviled eggs are great and the burger too . There are some things on the menu I would love to try but I'm a little scared to try . I wish they had a sampler plate so I don't have to order each one alacart . Beers a super great too. The breakfast is nice just want a few more choices is all for lunch and breakfast .. Great overall xxxxx
