Jeff is a real breath of fresh air. Very professional, really nice and very reasonable. He re-keyed my entire house, Changed out latches, bolts and put in a new deadbolt that he went out to find to match my door. He was here for quite a while, and he really wanted to make sure that all of the doors worked correctly and smoothly. He is really amazing. I wish all of my service contractors were like Jeff! Thank you Jeff!!!!!

We were out in Scottsdale on a Saturday afternoon, and we had read decent reviews of this place on Yelp.  I was amazed at how bad this place was! I am so tired of poorly executed places that charge a premium (for the category) and deliver poorly.  This place is really awful.  It tries to be trendy with the wait-team dressed in striped blue knit shirts that look like they have been washed a few too many times.  The food is fair to poor, presented in a heaped plating style that was not appetizing.  I had a salmon entree and my friend a chicken dish.  Neither was really special in any way.  Chips are good, salsa is not. Drinks are way overpriced.  The  "house" 'Rita was $8 and was small, really too sweet and totally unforgettable. There are many, many better places out there.  This one has a bunch of Scottsdale, tired wannabes as patrons (I agree with Jenny R.!), and an untrained staff.  Our waitperson was OK in the beginning, but she disappeared at the end.  Our final drink was served 10 minutes after we finished our meal, at least 15 minutes after we ordered it!  We almost called 911 to file a "missing waitperson" report.  Instead, $75.00 later (for three drinks and two entrees, tax and tip), we left and we will not be back.

This gym is in a great location, the staff is generally friendly, but it is really not well maintained.  The carpets throughout are filthy, the equipment is often off line or maladjusted. The locker rooms are really poorly cleaned and often smell horribly.  I have had a month to month membership, and I plan to cancel.  This summer the poor conditions finally pushed me and some of my friends over the edge and we will look elsewhere.  Do yourself a favor and find a cleaner gym.

I was hesitant to go to Taco Guild even though several of my friends had told me it was great. This is a challenge with Social Media. The other Yelp reviewers that I read were luke warm to negative. I am a very picky person. Well traveled. Very demanding. A group of five friends all ventured into the Taco Guild on a Friday night after Thanksgiving, and we were thrilled. The atmosphere is hip and rocking! No wonder the reviewer thought that it had no kid friendly menu! They are right, but they should not knock the place! It is not meant for kids. Shame on them for expecting that from a Taco/Tequila Bar!!!!! It is also loud in a good way. The vibe is super modern, really epitomizing what is happening on Phoenix. The energy was awesome. The drinks were adventurous, if not always successful. We all had a different one, and some were better than others, but none was boring. The food was reasonable in price and tasty, with the hot sauces really awesome. We had planned on buying some to take home, but, sadly, we forgot. We will be back to do so! The tacos were delicious, the burritos were also great. I had the chicken burrito with a side of beans. Others had the steak burrito and various traditional or modern tacos. All were really very good. Service was great, prompt and fun loving. Really hip!  All in all I am thrilled that we ignored the rather mixed reviews on Yelp. They were often missing the point of this urban marvel. The architecture of this converted church alone makes it worth the trip. The food is an added extra. Don't hesitate! Just go!
