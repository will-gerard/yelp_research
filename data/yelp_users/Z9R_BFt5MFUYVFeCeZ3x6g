This is one hell of a luxury country club.  Everything they do is first class.  Golf course, locker rooms, fitness, dining, etc. is second to none. The clubhouse was recently renovated at the cost of over $20M.     The golf course has been around since 1899 and used to host the Phoenix Open prior to the TPC.  In the last 3 years this golf course has become THE BEST manicured golf course in town.  With green running consistently at 10-14 I would challenge you to find a better putting surface in the valley.  Adam Bringham is the director of golf and a great face guy for the club.  As a life long golfer and someone who has walked in to a lot of pro shops, the PCC shop is top notch.  They stock over $200k of apparel and equipment from brand names like Lindeberg, Travis Mathews, Polo Golf, etc.  Adam and his staff run 7-10 quality golf tournaments a year and truly make your guests feel at home.  PCC has a beautiful lunch buffet and salad bar set up every day of the week for lunch.  Business men and women flock to the men's and mixed grill for lunch each day.  Chef does a great job of creating desirable dinner specials and I've yet to have anything on the menu that I didn't like.  Every country club in town has reduced their pricing.  That being said, for $22,500 this might be the best value for your money.  Memberships were once selling for over $60,000.  If you are looking for a true LUXURY club this is the spot!

I'm The Duke of one of the worst Safeway's in town?  This is the closest grocery to my home.  I've been going here for years.  It serves it's purpose but it's by no means glamorous.  If you need the bare necessities this will suit you just fine, otherwise I'd go across the street to AJ's!

I've been a member of MVCC since I was 7 years old (over 20 years).  This country club has become a staple in the Moon Valley community.  Unlike other "country clubs" Moon Valley is a reflection of the community that supports it.  There are members from all walks of life that come together to enjoy swimming, tennis, basketball, golf, dining, etc.  Ego is checked at the door as plumbers, accountants, contractors, and doctors all sit at the same table to share in what the club has to offer.    The championship golf course was redesigned in the 90's by golf architect Bob Cup.  At over 7,000 yds it is a true test of golf.  The layout itself can compete with any country club course in the valley.  On any given day there are 3-4 different groups playing at the club with a set game and tee times.  It's one of the few places I have been where new members can assimilate quickly in to a group that fits their social and gambling needs on the golf course.  The club has recently restructured it's monthly dues schedule.  Monthly dues for a full golf member are down to $495 a month.  This is $200-$500 below other country clubs around the valley.  For the price and product I could not think of a better club for a young family.

Chicago style THICK crust pizza!  YES PLEASE!  I've been going to this location since I was a small child.  At that time it was one of only a few.  They are now all over the valley.  I can't eat Barro's but once or twice a month because I'm scared of how much weight I might gain, but I always look forward to a couple slices and some wings.  They have a decent little salad bar that I sometimes stop in to for lunch.  They use all the ingredients from the pizza (peperoni, ham, mozzarella, onions, olives, etc.) to stock the salad bar.  I continue to give Barro's a thumbs up!

About 2 years ago a girlfriend took me with her to class.  Two years later I'm still going and it has changed my life.    As a collegiate golfer I had practiced yoga in a number of different settings.   Nothing could have prepared me for what I have experienced at Sumits.  Whether you are an advanced yogi or it's your first class the teachers at Sumits are welcoming and ready to guide you.  I went from a student who could barely finish a class to a seasoned yogi that looks forward to practice each day.  The room studio is HOT and takes some getting used to.  But once your body becomes accustomed it's an opening and detoxifying experience.  The well orchestrated classes are the same each time and help build strength, flexibility, and balance.  The practice is as much about mental healing though as it is physical.  It's the one time of day when you can truly let go of everything in the outside world and focus on yourself.  I'm of the opinion that this type of yoga should be a part of anyone's routine who is looking for a well balanced body and mind.  I can't say enough good things about this studio and it's staff.

This is one of my favorite dive bars in the area.  I grew up at "The Back Nine Bar & Grill".  This is essentially that bar (same location & patrons) with an upgraded menu, staff, TV's, specials etc.  The drink are cheap and it's full of drunks from all over Moon Valley.  They are now open at 6:00 am for breakfast.  The food is pretty functional for what it is and as already mentioned you can't beat the price.  i would recommend it to drinkers and sports fans but not food enthusiasts.

If you haven't heard about Phoenix Ale Brewery you will!  Two experienced beer guys have come together to start this great brewery.  The founder of Pyramid Brewery out of Seattle Washington George Hancock and 20 year salesmen Greg Fretz.  Having only opened their doors in early 2011 they now have over 100 handles at bars across town and are in Total Wine, Bevmo, Costco, Etc.  Their first beer was Fretzy's Unfiltered Ale.  This was named after Greg Fretz who is the face of the company.  It's a cloudy English ale with lots of flavor.  This beer was followed by the Camelback IPA (my personal favorite) and the Watermelon Wheat.  They recently opened a store front pub where you can enjoy any of the three beers they offer.  They've set up tables, tv's, dart board, foosball, etc.  You will find either George Hancock or Greg Fretz behind the counter.  They are both willing to tell you all about their beers and give you a tour of the brewery.  This is a must for any craft beer lover.  The Phoenix area really likes a quality local brew and I'm certain Phoenix Ale Brewery is going to help fill that void!
