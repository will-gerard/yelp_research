My wife and I've taken our cars there for the past few years.  We really trust them and they are always honest and upfront about estimates, costs and then actual charges.  I recommend them to all of our friends.  They also will give you a ride to and from your house if you live close enough.

normal hair cuts are about $20.  they know what they are doing and use a hot lather at the end to shave your neck.  i've been going for about 10 years.   normal guys should feel right at home here! a true barber shop.  never a long wait for a walk in either.

The pizza is thin crust and very good.  Maybe a bit greasy, but still really good.  I didn't have a beer when I was here, so I can't comment on the selection.  No sports on TV, just old movies.  The decor is like you walked into a rummage sale from 1950.  Great outdoor patio and a nice inside spot also.  Not a huge fan of the atmosphere indoors, but thats just personal taste.  I like sports on tv when I'm in a restaurant, not the lone ranger.   Very friendly staff and great pizza.  We'll be back for sure.

Great beer, great atmosphere.  The food is good with a variety of choices.  Try the soft pretzel & a hop knot.  Great place for watching sports too.

Delux is great - lots of good beers on tap.  also a bunch of vegetarian options - grilled cheese is great as is the caprese sandwich.  we usually sit at the bar which is good.  they have a great patio even though it overlooks a parking lot.  inside seating is not for me - it's like long picnic benches where if its crowded you are right next to strangers.   something i hate.  great atmosphere and a smallish tv which usually has sports on it.

I really liked the Vig.  the atmosphere was really cool, great outdoor area.  good beer selection and the food was pretty good.  not a lot of vegetarian options, but we made do with a greek salad with the chicken taken out and onion rings.    we'll definitely go back.

i'ts hard to give a place where you see a lot of boob a bad review, but i have to.  the food is pretty crappy.  some english & irish beer on tap, but i'm not a huge fan of those.  it's all mainstream stuff you can find at safeway.  i guess not a bad place to get a beer and watch a game if there's no other choice and you have't seen 1/2 a boob in 6 months.  but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here.

greatest place.  despite it being in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood- we saw two women walking in the parking lot with laundry baskets on their heads - i thought i was in a nat geo special!  - and it being really, really small and dark - i like it.  amazing vegetarian options - in fact, i think they have most of their regular options in vegetarian form.  and great beer on tap.  you don't mind waiting a while since it does take a while to bake these when you have a good beer to drink.   they even have the pastys raw so you can take them home and cook them there.   i highly recommend this place.   now all i ask is that you open one near desert ridge!! also..like i said, have some time to spare, since it does take a while for them to bake the food.

The food is good, and they really do a great job offering a lot of vegetarian choices.  They also have a lot of really good beers.  Nothing too out of the ordinary though, and I wish they'd put a little more effort into seeking out new beers.  They have a few seasonals they rotate in but even they are pretty mainstream - Sam Adams Seasonal, etc.    I also think it's pretty expensive. 2 people who eat and have a few drinks can get up to $100.  But they do have a lot of TV's for sports.  All in all, a pretty good place.

i'll divide this into 2 reviews.   watching a game and hanging out:  good place.  good atmosphere, lots of tv's and big beers.    from a food standpoint - and especially a vegetarian - awful.  now the reality is, i've not always been a vegetarian and the Monaco wrap thing is pretty good.  and i loved burgers, but even then, every time i got done, i always felt a bit sick to my stomach.  fries are really greasy.   so to summarize, if you are looking for good food, go elsewhere.  if you want to hang out and watch a game - go.    and to zipps - why not upgrade the menu a little?

I really like the location and the layout of the restaurant/bar.  Great place to watch some sports and have a beer.  However, for a vegetarian who likes IPA's this isn't the place to go.  Pizza or salad are your only real choices.  From a beer standpoint, I just don't like German beers, so thats my fault not theirs.  Their Hefeweizen is actually pretty good, but I really don't go beyond that.  I don't like the Pilsners, Lagers or Kolsches.  I wish they'd go outside the box and do some more styles of brewing and add some vegetarian things to the menu.  As it is, we really only go about 2x a year due to the limited options.  Not saying it's a bad place, unless you are a vegetarian.

Really good black bean veggie burger, full bar and HD tv's.  Decent beer, although we sat down and they were advertising Anchor Steam Porter for $4!  I was the happiest person ever.  Alas, they were out.  Why are they out?  There's a BevMo about 20 feet away.  Go buy a case!  Even if they pay full retail they are still getting a huge markup at $4/bottle!  I really have no idea why places don't offer better beer selections.   They give you a checklist and let you design your own burger so I really enjoy that.  Seeing all the options gives me new ideas of things to try.  Anyways, we've been here several times and really enjoy the food.  Service usually sucks - even though we almost always sit at the bar, but this time was actually pretty good.  So hopefully they've had other complaints about it and now it's back on track.   The onion ring/sweet potato fries are really good too.

went for a birthday dinner with my dad.  not a bad place, not a great place, a little run down - the vinyl seat in our booth was torn.  the food is great for greasy food lovers.  nothing special.  decent beer on tap, but nothing spectacular.  had Santan Devils Ale - a nice local selection.  for dinner i had a grilled cheese sandwich.  i've had worse, and i've had better.  it's not the closest place to where we live, and it's not worth the drive.  i think there's better options in the area, honestly.

my wife and i come here probably 2-3 x a month.  great fire baked pizza made in the back of the restaurant.  if its chilly - sit by the oven in the back. the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars not 5 is the low def tv's - come on, pay the extra $10/month and give me my HD!!  nice outdoor patio too. one other huge plus - 4 peaks Hop Knot on draft in an iced glass! yay!

possibly the best vegetarian friendly restaurant in phoenix.  love the pita crisp.  pretty good beer on tap,  and lots of menu choices.  we usually sit at the bar where they have several HD tv's and a full liquor selection.  great atmosphere too.  i've been to 2 other pita jungle locations and like this one the best.

love this pool.  close to my house, very clean.  lots of lanes for laps. just get a schedule so you know when to go and lane availability.  plus cheap!  only $2 to go and swim laps.

We've been to 3 locations - Sedona, Scottsdale & PV.  The pizza is always good and service is always great.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the overuse of garlic.  I'm not a garlic fan, but if you like it - this is the place for you.  If you are being attacked by a Vampire - head to Picazzo, you are safe here.  Last time we went to the PV location they had Dogfish Head 90 on tap, which is amazing.  Pretty rare to find that on tap anywhere.  Great lunch specials also, I think it's like $7.50 for a slice of pizza, salad and drink - not bad in Scottsdale.  They also do a good job of communicating via email when they have specials.  All the locations are really nicely decorated and very upscale feeling.  Highly recommend it!

really good food & a good bar.  the location is good too.  definitely gone back numerous times.  parking is a bit of a pain, but not horrible and they have valet, although i think valet is the biggest scam around.

food is decent and the beer selection is good.  service is the worst.  i've been there over 5 times now and every time it gets worse.  one time we sat in an empty restaurant for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to the bar and wait on us.  last night we went there during happy hour and then got the bill with full price food on it.  we asked why it wasn't happy hour pricing and the waiter says "i gave you the regular price portion" we said "we ordered the food during happy hour, we assumed that you'd bring us the happy hour food"  he literally just stared for about 20 seconds like we'd just spoken a foreign language.  then he said well, maybe you ordered it after 6pm.  the woman i was with said "the receipt is time stamped at 549" he goes, well i guess i could give you the happy hour price then, but the portions for that are much smaller.  total jackass.   i know that the face of the restaurant is the service, and if they are lousy or have a bad day that will reflect poorly on the restaurant which may not be to blame.  but after 5 times, i can safely say there are better alternatives to this place.  so many restaurants within a 5 mile radius - don't go here.

great food!  had a really good grilled cheese sandwich and my wife had the vegetarian chili.  plenty of parking, but in a shitty part of town.  it's in "transition" - and I'd have to guess that means they are only being broken into 4x a week instead of 5x a week.   one TV, and a very small bar.  the restaurant is actually an old house that has been converted into a restaurant, so it's a bit tight as they tried to put a lot of tables in there - still, not that bad.  but good luck getting a place at the bar.  lots of outside seating too, but it's right on 7th st, so there's  a lot of traffic and nothing to look at unless you like staring at vacant lots, shopping cars and i'm sure if you look hard enough hypodermic needles.    great beer selection and great prices - very impressive.  so definitely a plus for that.  one thing that bummed me out was not having a soda dispenser - i asked for  a club soda and they brought me a bottle of it.  that sort of tilted me for some reason.  at least they had it i guess.  the clientele...well, let's just say if you were looking to form a softball team, this is not the place.  if you were looking to form a communist rally - perfect!  lot's of tattoos and stupid earrings.  people trying a bit too hard to be their version of cool.     it's not really close to our house, but i can see us heading back there, my wife really enjoyed the food and the impressive beer selection might make it worth the journey.  viva la revolution!  or whatever that phrase is.

i really can't see ever going back here unfortunately unless it's for a tube or something very generic.  bought an overpriced bike computer here on saturday.  there were 2 older guys in there, one pretty useless and then the other one who was more helpful.  came back on sunday because i couldn't get it to measure the speed.  only the useless older guy was there seeming overwhelmed with the 3 customers in the store and severely out of breath from having to bring a repaired bike out from the back.   he had no idea what to do and said his mechanic was in on tuesday.  then he asked me if i'd even bought the computer there.  i said, yes, about 18 hours ago and we'd even talked for a while during the purchase.  i guess he didn't recognize me or the computer that his store sold.  anyways - landis isn't that far away - definitely go there instead.  palo verde has about 25 bikes for sale in the store and about 1 of everything else - so don't expect to have much choice in anything.   not sure if anyone in this store had been on a bike in the past 20 years.  landis is on shea & scottsdale and has a ton of bikes for sale, a lot of other gear & equipment and a fully stocked repair shop.

I really liked this place.  We were here on a Saturday afternoon around 3 and it was empty - which I actually enjoy! Not a fan of crowds.  It's a really swanky pizza "lounge" Couches in the bar area.  Pretty decent beers too.  At first I was concerned because they are definitely more wine-centric and I hate wine.  All I saw on the specials menu was crap macro brews.  But upon closer examination they had a pretty good selection.  The pizza was really good and my wife had some ravioli or something that they made without meat for her.  Good TV's, but no baseball package.  I should deduct a star for that, but I guess they don't claim to be a sports bar , so that's on me.  Great service, which I guess isn't hard when workers outnumber patrons 5-1!

Crust is great!  Lots of vegetarian choices, and the pizza is really good.  My wife and I had the thin crust hand tossed pizza.  It's shaped like a bicycle seat - not your traditional pizza.  The sauce is peppery and sweet at the same time - really unique and tasty.  I was a bit bummed out by the beer selection which I was told were the basic Miller, Coors, Peroni and Moretti - which seems to be all the same weak lager.  Then another waiter told me to try the darker Moretti - it was great!  All served in an iced glass.  I wish the first guy would have known about that one when I asked if they had any darker beers.    Decent TV's and a nice enough atmosphere.  I wish they had blinds or something to make me forget the fact that I was sitting on the corner of Tatum & Bell in a strip mall, but I can overlook that.  Very attentive and pleasant staff.    We'll definitely go back and it's really close to our house also.

perk is great!  the food is really good and comes out fast.  the staff is the friendliest around.  there is an einstein bagel's a few doors down - why go there? honestly - i wish more people in the community supported locally owned places like this instead of chains. the money stays right here in the community instead of being shipped out of state - and god knows this state needs jobs and money!    i'd highly recommend this restaurant.

Great new restaurant in old town.  A  lot of craft beers on tap.  The food is a bit pricey, but i guess it's old town  - so to be expected. However the happy hour pricing is really good.  worth the trip to old town for us!
