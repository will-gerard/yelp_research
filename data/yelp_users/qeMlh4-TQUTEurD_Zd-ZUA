Totally not impressed with this place. As a die hard foodie, I love being adventurous and trying new restaurants and creative cuisine. While I did appreciate the attention to detail with the plating the flavors were often overpowering. Like the chef was trying to hard rather than the food being the star. Non of the dishes were at proper temperature and non of the items tasted fresh. All on all totally not impressed. I'd recommend Posh or Cork over this place any day.

My new Fav nail place....Steven is best nail tech ever. Place is super clean, staff is friendly. Deluxe Pedicure is amazing and has fresh oranges that they massage on your feet...awesome!! Feeling very spoiled right now.
