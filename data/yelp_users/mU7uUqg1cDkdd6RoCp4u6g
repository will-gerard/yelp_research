I have been going to Brother's Pizza since 1997, every time I walk in I am treated like family. The old world atmosphere that is always present there just makes it feel like a second home. Last night a buddy of mine from work came with me to grab a couple slices and a beer, even he said "best pizza I have had since I moved to Arizona". Our waitress Kyle was very attentive, courteous and polite. Thank you for making me a lifetime customer!!

I've been coming to this Ramiro's since the late 90's. I have always had a great experience when it comes to the food, always so fresh tasing!! The staff is always friendly and smiling and their menudo on the weekends is definitely some of the best around. You can really taste the love and care that goes in to all of the food here.

My kids love Taco Bell, I love to take them here because it's cheap lol. Usually we go to the one down the road because every single time I come to this one, they always seem to either screw up the order, or short change all the food by stuffing it full of lettuce and barely any "meat" so do your self a favor, drive the extra couple miles to avoid this Taco Bell

Horrible just horrible...I went to Pawn 1st to see if they had any good deals on jewelry. After witnessing multiple rude employees completely ignoring the customers, and just lazily standing around talking it was clear to me that this is a place to stay far far away from when looking for a good deal. Not to mention how overpriced their items are. I saw in their showcase a camping knife marked up as double than what it even sells for in the store retail. Save your money and the aggrivation and stay away from this crooked store!!

Was expecting a lot better product from a restaurant that was featured in Guy Fiore's "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives". Over cooked shredded roast beef for the green chili, so much cheese it masked any type of flavor and the staff was rude and acted like it was annoying to even have a customer. The only enjoyable edible experience I had was the salsa. I definitely won't be back!!

Best Pita joint I have been to!! They don't use frozen pre-seasoned pita meat, their chicken shawerma is outstanding and the staff is always so friendly and willing to let you try something before you decided to order it. Even the owner works the counter just to make sure all of the customers are happy. I will continue to eat here for years to come!! They really hit a homerun at this store!!
