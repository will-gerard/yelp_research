We love this place! My hubby and I share the gyro plate. Its so big and has so much meat for us to share it! Very filling and we like that it's a healthier alternative to a lot of the fast food joints around and for $10 for 2 people it's affordable. Meat is juicy, rice is fluffy, my hubby loves their pita bread and I love the greek side salad.

Buffalo chicken salad is my fave menu item of all!! Love that they now serve breakfast too! Great ambiance for a low key casual get together with family or friends. All of the staff is very friendly

Yes this place is ALWAYS busy but I've never left unhappy!! Best massage with pedicures Ive had in a long time. It's worth the wait in my opinion.... I come prepared and bring a book and a drink and relax....

At a request of a friend have given this place multiple chances and on my last experience it was terrible!!! The nail tech first grinded my nails and down my cuticle beds so raw I left bleeding. He couldn't even paint my nails.... the polish was so thick that it wasnt drying and kept smearing. He kept blaming iton the particular colors I chose. After being there almost 2 hours I complained to Thao the owner and they wanted me to wait to fix it. After I had wasted 2 hours why would I wait another 30 minutes for abother personto fix his work. I negotiated to pay for the pedicure sonce that turned out somewhat ok and left and I've never gone back since!!!!

First they have the windshield repair guy hustling you, then they try to upgrade the wash. I wanted a good vaccum after my dogs were in the back seat and left pet hair and mentioned this was my main concern. They were trying to get me to spend $100 to vaccum the dog hair.... I told them forst so my $20 car was rifhr and we'll see. So glad I did that because it looks like they didn't even make an effort to vaccum the interior. I live 2 minutes away from this car wash and I can tell youthis much I will drive out of the way to go somewhere else.... bad service and poor quality wash.

The manager or owner reached out to me in what I assume was his attempt to explain the poor service and sadly he was unable to acknowledge any lack in service and rather assumed that I clearly didn't know what should be included in a car wash service. He continued to recommended I should have paid extra for the $100 detailing service to get my upholstery vacummed. Why would I pay $100 for you to complete a service when you can't properly complete a $20 service? He had NO apology and no concern with improving customer service for future customers. His messages confirmed that I for sure I will not return to this establishment.  After I updated my original post and added the screen grabs pictures to my post from our message exchange showing proof of his poor service the manager responded again(see below). For some reason he thinks an interior and exterior car wash shouldnt include a decent vacumm. I also didn't pay $13.95, I paid for the higher end $20 car wash, which is the one he recommended for a better quality vaccum, which didn't happen. My original review stated I paid for the $20 car wash but he must have overlooked that detail, which seems to be an apperent trend. Maybe a change in management is what this place needs.

Love this place! Especially the happy hour specials from 3-7pm. The wait staff is very attentive and makes every effort to ensure your meal is pleasant. The last time I dined here with my girls for a GNO we met the owner and he was very friendly, approachable, and involved in his business. 2 thumbs up!

Liars, poor service and over priced. If you have a customer service issue it won't be fixed in a professional workman like manner. Not a good company to do business with as they caused damage to our home and denyed any responsibility but had many excuses readily available that someone with half a brain would not buy. Wish we would have gone with another company. They should be called Always disappointed.....

Took 2 months later for acknowledgement to my review. What excellent display of customer service. You defend your service yet after we tried to work with your company to fix the work in our "NEW" home which you refused to fix and began playing the blame game and said our builder made the mistake.  We have had no other problems at all with our new home and our problems may have been when we suspected that the owner and his son who may have been popping Adderall on the job.  Then the following day you proceeded to harass my husband via text so much he asked you multiple times to stop and it didn't stop. It became so obnoxious that we had to contact our agent who referred us to you to ask you to stop contacting us. I don't always post all my positive reviews on Yelp but I definitely ALWAYS post any REALLY bad experiences as a "buyer beware" for other customers who look to Yelp for guidance.

Love this place for an after work evening HH with my girlfriends. Great drink specials..... my fave is the mule with the muddled pineapple,  the name of the drink escapes me right now, but it's yummy! Great music and ambiance and the wait staff is always very friendly and attentive. Haven't had too many food items off the menu to comment on that.  Their drinks are yummy and they have an extensive amout of beers on tap for the beer lover.
