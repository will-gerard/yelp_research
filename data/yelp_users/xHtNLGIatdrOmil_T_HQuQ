This place seemed like a typical diner but beware, it was not.  The cups were dirty (old lipstick) and my side of peaches came with a moldy piece the waitress, Pam, tried to convince me was a 'mushroom'.  After a disgusting experience, at no point did the manager come over or the waitress apologize.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and if I could rate below one star, I would.

I am absolutely in love with Fired! I am gluten free, and their 'almost gluten-free' was THE BEST crust I have had in a long time. Additionally, for the prices, I would say you more than get your money's worth!  I highly recommend Fired for their reasonable, fresh and delicious pizza!

Love this place! With great/reasonable food, a dog friendly patio and amazingly friendly staff, it's a Mid-town must

I didn't even end up getting my car washed because the guy was so obnoxiously pushy, trying to sell me EVERYTHING on the list and then saying 'Oh so you don't care about the car,' when I declined a $200 exterior package.  After talking in circles for 5 minutes, I thought I had reiterated I wanted only the $35 car wash only to be handed a receipt for $130!   Then, he disappeared and another guy came over. I explained the receipt was wrong and without even looking at it he goes 'Yes, that what you need though.' I drove away and will never go back.  Your sales tactics are horrible and your guys are extremely pushy to the point of being sleazy.  No wonder you have 2 stars.

We had a mixup with our name being placed at the bottom of the wait list. The staff quickly corrected it and sat us.  The patio is clean, shaded and dog friendly!  The food was great and the potions were sizable and worth the price.
