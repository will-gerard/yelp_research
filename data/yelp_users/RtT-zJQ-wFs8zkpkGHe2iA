Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!

I got a pedicure here yesterday and it was perfect. I made an appointment earlier in the day, but they do take walk-ins. The place was clean and the people were very friendly. If you have really callused feet (like me) get the Pamper Me Pedi, you get extra callus treatment and it is totally worth it. My feet are summer-ready now! Top Nails is close to my office, so I'll be coming in regularly from now on.

Not good. Just got an order of cashew chicken, and it literally tastes like chicken pot pie. The sesame chicken is very bland, and the crab won tons are cold and gross. If you're craving your typical Chinese food, I wouldn't get it from here.

The breakfast burritos from America's are my go-to when I need a quick and hearty breakfast on a Sunday morning. My favorite is the chorizo with potato and egg, but the carne asada breakfast burrito is a close second. The restaurant is within walking distance from my house, so I stop in at least once a month. They are always super friendly and super fast. Don't ever change, America's!

I don't always get excited about hot dogs, but this is NOT your typical soggy-bun plus shriveled-dog kind of hot dog stand. They have a variety of meats to choose from, from veggie to brat to spicy beer dog, and a huge list of unique toppings like mango chutney and chipotle cream cheese. My absolute favorite part is the warm fluffy pita bread that your dog comes on instead of a plan old bun.  If you're a Short Leash newbie, try one of their combos like the Aiko, which Brad recommended I try with the spicy dog for a perfect sweet-and-spicy combination. Or go for their featured Dog of the Day, which today was a Greek-style dog with feta and homemade tzatziki sauce. Yum!

The drinks are delish, but the food is consistently terrible. I've eaten here 3 times and every time it's been bla, bland or just plain bad. Stick to the margaritas, never get the food.

Jeanne's new store is fantastic. I stopped in last Saturday just to see her new digs, and ended up leaving with two new-to-me bracelets and a spoon ring made by a new local artist. Pearls has a great selection of vintage clothes (for women AND men), jewelry, handbags, and housewares. And the space is open, organized, and easy to browse through. When I was in, Jeanne's mother was working, and she's just as fun to chat with as her daughter.   Great stuff, great atmosphere, and great people working there = 5 stars from me!

Ordered a pizza for delivery using their online ordering system. 2 hours went by, and no pizza came and no one called. I finally called them, and they said we were out of their delivery zone and that our order would have to be refunded. (We are 1.3 miles away.) That would have been great to know 2 hours ago.
