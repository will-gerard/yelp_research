This was an excellent adventure. The service is super friendly and the food is unique and deserves more praise. I ordered the fried chicken biscuit with gravy and cheese and bacon. That was the best choice of all the meals I tried and will be what I order when I return. We started with pulled pork fries that were BBQ flavored with a mustard twist. It was bold but I would try something else next time. The burgers were great and the fries were too. Great late night food, I would suggest this to my yelper friends.

I think A lot of people get the wrong impression of this place before they even come in, like it's supposed to be some elegant steakhouse or perfect dinner spot. The service was fantastic, We had a party of seven and the wait was not bad. We had plenty of food / bread / salad before our meal. The chicken friend steak was some of the best I've ever had, and the mashed potatoes and gravy all over was excellent. This is not a hit or miss place, the steak was tasty and large. Yes it did need some steak sauce but nothing was incredibly overpriced. I don't see how people payed 25 a person ordering soda, when th fried steak was maybe 13? and the ribeye was maybe 16? Thats a expensive soda for those peeps. I would say it was worth every penny, and also it made great leftovers the next day. This place is genuine, and a good spot to hit up every other month or so. This place (contrary to others beliefs) Is a Diner, and you will notice this on the way in. I suggest you try it yourself, if your not a high roller with perfect expectations on everything, I think you will like this place.

This place would make my grandma proud to live in Az if she was still around drinking a bud light and playing the slots :)  The buffet was to die for, but a little pricey at 25 a head. The cigar room was perfect with a well set mood and nice slow jams being played live.  The casino was packed with thousands of people celebrating their life, or their downfall into addiction.  Everyone seemed happy to be there though and I had a great time celebrating a birthday with the boys.   Of all the casinos in Az, this would be my only stop if it wasn't for me dealing with Rage in the cage at wild horse pass every now and then.  No live roulette is the only con, but the poker room more than makes up for it.  Don't expect to win squat, but have a blast at this feel good establishment :)

This subway is the best one in my immediate area. They have a knowledgeable staff and get your order right without any flack. The store is clean and well kept, and the service is quite friendly.   Great quick meal and in my opinion a healthier option then pizza or burger king nearby.

I think they have been listening to the other reviews because I did not experience some of the flaws this weekend when I took my wife there. We were seated right away, the service was amazing, the bread was fresh and tasty, along with the food. There is plenty to be said about this place and I would suggest not coming in wearing shorts and a muay thai tee like me. The prices were fair for what you get as well as the ambiance. I ordered the lasagna, and my wife Fettucine Alfredo with Pancetta and Peas saying she really enjoyed it and it was authentic tasting. I enjoyed my dinner and would come back during their happy hour with reduced prices for sure. I'd give the service 5 stars, the food 3, and the atmosphere 4. I think the owner was there singing happy birthday songs in Italian which almost bumped it to 5 stars for the cool experience. Just have to judge this place on your own I'd say, but overall it was good. :)   ps. That F*ing cheesecake is to die for

Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Let me just start off by saying we only ran into 2-3 people that seemed to care for us or explain / know the situation out dad was in for a whole week. We ran into issues with conflicting doctors causing us to stay and our loved one to not have solid food for a week straight. They ran out of needed medical equipment and then debated on procedures some more. No one properly explained what was going to happen until a day or so before discharge and nothing was fixed. When we did our follow up and were still having major medical issues we were advised to go to another hospital by our surgeon. The difference is night and day and I will never go through the emergency process in another abrazo facility ever again. The cna's gave us the best care we received. The staff of doctors seemed to forget we were even there or that they needed to resolve our issue. They were also lost when it came to explaining what needed to happen and what was happening. We are in the process of filing a negative report to hospital management. I would suggest to avoid this place for long term emergency care.

The whole expierience was not what I expected it to be. Clear case of not judging a book by it's cover. Sometimes when you start things off on a bad note, things only go downhill from there. The place looks great when you walk in, very nice decor happy people galore. We had a party of two and were told it was going to be 15 minutes which was fine seeing it was new years eve and everywhere was packed. It was more like 20, which is fine unless parties of 4 or more that came in 10 minutes after you are being sat first. When we said something 30 seconds later we were brought to our table. I would have rather sat at the bar seeing it was a small table in a awkward place. Still looked pretty decent, minus what looked like a leaky roof with missing tiles and stains. The chips were good, the salsa was trying to hard with the whole roasted  chipotle thing and was not that good. But we were hungry and finished pretty much the whole small bowl before we were even offered drinks (10-15 min). Strike 2! So My wife ordered a Draft american beer. It tasted horible, something was wrong with the tap. We told the waiter and instantly he said, "it tastes like copper right?" How are you guys going to know something is wrong and do nothing about it. He suggested that we stuck with mexican beer because there is no problem with that tap, My wife ordered a bottled beer. We ordered our food right away, I had the sonoran which was a shredded beef burro, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale, and my wife had stuffed chicken. My burro was covered in 50 cent nacho cheese, and filled with meat that was unseasoned and bland. My wifes dish was decent, could have been better, was a little to stong tasting on the seasoning. We asked for the check immediatly, and could tell by the three tables around us, that we were not alone in this bad expierience. They push this place off like it's authentic, it's really just crappy tex mex food. Go to Macayos, or even Garcias for better food, prices, and expierience.

This was a true value for 25 bones on fathers day. Very tough and well thought out course with a good mix of everything including old pokes in front of you making the experience last all day. I shot a 90 (18 over on this par 72) and had a blast with my dad and talking to the guys who work there. Good ambiance, great golf, 4 sets of tees to play off of like a championship course. Not a ton of tight holes where you can hit it 3 blocks over with a slice. Check it out before it gets too hot, wait...

Best red and green chili burros in town! Friendly service and authentic  food. Check it out!  also, to get a 2 dollar plate of fried ice cream with flan and a deep fried shell is awesome, can't think of a better desert for the cost in the valley!

This is a great dive bar and has some awesome burgers to boot. I would have given it five stars if the service have us a bit more attention. I had a chili size open face burger and my wife had the original. Both were great and tasty. We also ordered the nachos made with fries. This was huge and way too filling. They have a nifty selection of draft beers and daily drink specials. It is not in the neighborhood but I would recommend this spot to all of my yelp friends needing a burger fix.

This Macayos puts the bell road one to shame, they actually have service, get your order fast, cook the food like how you ordered, etc. etc. etc.  Every problem I have ever expierienced at the bell road Macayos this place makes up for 10 fold. They have a popular happy hour at the bar, not for me. Great mexican food and expierience.

The course was in decent shape but I do have some issues that take away from it's overall rating:  The need to have animal control come clean the 8-9 dogs off the course or make some sort of notice for the residents that the golf course is not their back yard.  We had  a total of 6 golf carts in one round of golf due to sticking gas pedals and breaks... this is a safety issue and made it impossible to get into a good grove. They are in dire need of some good service on their golf carts.  The course was fun and in good shape, just wish the risk I took on groupon was a great deal, as opposed to a par outing.

This is the best drunk food drunk money can buy. Very self explanatory, if not just order a greasy burger and enjoy. Never has any issues with this place at all, always friendly and correct. :)

I'm willing to travel because they have never messed up my hair, are very precise, and spend the time to do it right every time. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are 10 dollar haircut days and I always make my monthly trip to Metro on those days to save a few bucks. There is no better deal when it comes to quality cuts valley wide. The staff is always professional and they know what to ask you instead of just doing the same cut every time cough greatclips cough. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and my experience has always been worth the wait/ trip. They use a straight razor to finish off your cut which keeps you clean longer. I would highly recommend this barber shop to all of my Yelp friends.  Bring cash, if you want to skip the 95 cent charge card fee

This is by far the best quality Mongolian joint I have visited in the greater phoenix area. It was clean with fresh ingredients and meat cut just right for preparation. It was about 9 dollars a heads with a drink which is fair for what you get in quality. They have handy wax paper to mash stuff in your bowl for those who really want a ton, and it seemed to come in handy for the people who wanted a LOT of food. The cook was fast and professional and the service was good, with a smile. I did not get sick eating here +1 star, there was no left out mess or ran down seating area +1 star, the soup was good, selection was wide, and soda machines worked properly +1 star, and last but not least - the oil / sauce combos were the best around by far with a nice guide to help you season your meal to perfection. I would have given it five stars but that's pretty impossible for buffet style joints. Check this place out for their cheap weekly lunch specials it doesn't disappoint.

This is one unexpected gem of a place. We have always passed by carneceria's wondering what they were all about. We decided to try this one out on our local food journey. Not the best looking place, but real authentic and we heard rumors that they will prepare the meat you order for you. So we saw they had a "ESPECIAL" which was 3 pounds of carne asada cooked and prepared for 9.99, you get 2 choices regular or ranchero We stick with the ranchero because we like things a little on the spicy side, but I assure you it's not that bad. They do mostly speak spanish But I strictly used English just to make sure I could review them for all the customers who may come in. They understood and spoke very good english as well so this place is bi-lingual and you should have no problem if you speak only english. Well let's get back to the good stuff, The meat was perfect, we had a large party to serve so we purchased six pounds and they cooked it all and seasoned it for us while we waited (close to 10 minutes) This was the best Carne Asada I have had in AZ, The guac was really fresh, and eveything was perfect. We went down the road to get  corn tortillas because I like them super fresh and Ranch Market (see my other review) can not be beat in that department. I suggest to stock up on your favorite tortilla and get your meat cooked from here if your crunched for time or effort. You can also phone in I believe they had there number posted by the butcher. The chicken Fajitas look simply amasing I would be willing to bet those are super good as well if your not a big fan of the beef I would definatly suggest that. These guys know the right spice and the right way to cook there meats. I would definatly suggest these guys to anyone trying to enjoy some authentic carne asada. It's the best I have had in az and I have been here about 20 years of my life.

This place is one of those establishments where people have been true to since childhood, me being one of them. Even will see the local celebs in there from time to time, I have personally sat next to jerry calangalo ( ex owner of az sports teams, probably not spelled correctly) and others on a few notes. They have the perfect shredded beef taco, and I also enjoy there red chile burro, so try the combo. The chips are good and come non stop, I love the spicy red sauce that comes with them, it's tasty to douse pretty much everything you get with this sauce. One not so great thing is that they charge you for every soda you drink, I drink ice tea because of this - ice tea = free refils. They have good service and whenever I come across a waitress that is lack luster, they seem to disappear by the time I make it back.  It may seem tacky in there to upscale scottsdale folk but I think it has authentic written all over it. The food will back it up, great place for you and your family, but seriously stop leaving 1 dollar tips for parties over 3, I swear the cheapskates of america frequently go to Pedro's because walking out I have seen everything from 50 cents to one dollar left as a tip. I would suggest for anyone to at least go give this place a try and come open minded. It's real good!

I don't know if this place has gone downhill since the last reviews or if the people involved are used to lack luster "authentic" Mexican food. Party of two last night, just me and the wife yet it took the staff at least 10 minutes to set our table with menus and ask us about our drink of choice. (- 1 star) I ordered a #12 (Red chili burro, taco, R & B) and my wife ordered the Carne Asada plate. The food prep took 40 minutes to get to our table (-1 star), and the only exciting thing was watching the tables next to us get food in 15 minute intervals and by the time one table is finished eating the next received their food. My red chili burro had tough meat and the sauce was clearly out of a can and the wifes Carne Asade was far from par it was a tough double bogey. (-1 star) The place was packed so I gave them some slack but when the waitress says they are out of ice while another is putting ice in a pitcher that's where I draw the line. Horrible service from the majority of servers, with only one working hard (-1 star). Nothing like waiting 10 minutes for a refill or more chips, and the whole dinner for two was nearly 1.5 hours long for a hole in the wall cafe. I normally gives places a second shot, but it's a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I.E. Pedro's in Glendale, or Rita's off 43rd ave and the I-10. I will not be back :(

These guys have good BBQ, the only problem is they cook to their demographic so everything is over cooked, and they go light on their sauce on some and extremly heavy on many other items. Many bland items, but good happy hour specials and appitizers, and some good spicy bbq items.  Kind of pricy for what you get compared to others. Also the ditsy watresses would rather flit with guys in the back than ask you if you need a refill or something.(famous daves is way better) If I lived in sun city I would probably rate this establishment  with 4 or more stars but this young buck looks elsewhere for bbq delight. Texaz bbq or famous daves are much better choices.

Great brews and vibes all around. Perfect for those have to be hipster nights and while it gets busy there is always place to sit and chill outside (could be literal depending on temperature of said outside) my Wife had the chai latte and I had a velvet latte and both tasted great. We both also tried some pumpkin whoopie pies that were also great. Our party tried a mix off their menu and even a large coffee mug of Mac n cheese. Everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered and no real complaints. The restaurant and restrooms were clean and the staff was quite friendly as well. I would recommend lux to my yelp friends as well and it's worth a try. From what I understand they do have wifi available and showcase local art on their walls which is always a plus. Check them out !

Totally a fan of this place since before I joined the Military in 04. We enjoy coming to this place to forget about our diet and it's one of my favorite "dive's" ever. The Jade chicken is the bomb, the hot sauce is tangy sweet and they go well together in a burro or quesidilla. The Jerk fried rice is great, and the Jerk / Pollo Diabllo are great spicy options. I always leave this place so full I'm sick so I guess it's a great place to get out and try. Be sure to take samples if you are new so you can really tell what you like. Guy F was here and he had this expression of indulgence which I seem to mirror every time I eat here. Some say it's hit or miss but this place has never been a miss for me.   Viva la Bandido!

This was the right decision when it comes to brick oven pizza in Arizona. The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.  Let me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.  The ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients. The diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had. My wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it The banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy. The fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.  We left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received  I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Chipotle has always been good to me when I am in a hurry and this is no exception. People who complain about the price should go get food poisoning at some hole in the wall place or at least research it's price range beforehand online (like using yelp DUH) They are fast enough for how busy it gets and I have never had a problem they don't instantly fix. I suggest ordering online because if they get it wrong it's free, and usually still edible / good. The one off the 101 by costco has given me personally at least 15 free burritos/ bowls.  Happy rolling!

Quite honestly the best sandwich I have had in Arizona. I have been here twice because I frequent that side of town not often but I do wish I lived closer. I ordered the classic Philly and seasoned wedges both times I went and both times it was amazing. The bread is fresh and soft yet seems different than what you would buy at the store or have at the run of the mill sandwich shops. The meat is not too greasy nor dry and the toppings of the philly are perfectly blended in. Everything seems to complement each other leaving your taste buds in absolute bliss. Next time I go I'll branch out and order something else and be sure to update my review but man it's worth an hour drive for me. I would suggest this to all of my yelp friends and can't wait to be back there. It seems like a family ran business and everyone behind the counter was super polite and nice. Not many five stars out there but they deserve it!

I go here quite often and have never had any real issues at all with the staff or equipment. I'm not a guy who invests in personal training because you can find EVERYTHING online, I'd even go with saying you can find better instruction or even trainers online. But every time I have talked to an employee they have always been nice and professional. I have even participated in some cardio circuit classes here just to make it interesting, but it turned out not so great because I was the only guy in a 45 person class. I always wipe down my machines and rack my weights and for the most part the staff is actually on people about cleaning / racking and it seems to have gotten better.  There are a group of west siders who come in here wearing club clothes / boy shorts / full makeup and love to text. This is the only downer for me in the gym because they often sit on the machines I like to use, more power to them I guess. The Sauna works great, the pool is well maintained, and the locker room is kept clean.   The elliptical machines always seem to work fine.  Protein bar is cool.  There are enough free weights to accomplish gains    I would recommend this gym to my yelp friends, and I'm lucky to have my membership at the Pure Fitness price :)  remember...

I am actually going to write this review on the service center, we moved away from bell road toyota and decided to try a dealership a little closer to home. What a relief!!! I really don't like going to a dealership to work on my car, becaue I can do oil and brake changes myself, but sometimes in order to keep my warranty I have to drag it over to a toyota certified dealership and pay there prices. Well I was expecting to pay $300 for there blue service untill I met with there service rep and he told me I could go with a cheaper service and add on a tire rotation and it saved me $100 dollars. Plus he informed me about my battery life and the winter and slotted me in for a new battery free of charge before I hit that 36k mark and can no longer get a free one. So I saved $100 and recieved a brand new battery for my car. They gave me a estimated time when it would be done ( I had a appointment) and everything was spot on. What a good expierience compared to the money hungry service reps at bell road toyota, multiple times I have had to argue with them about how what they wanted me to do and how it had nothing to do with maintaining my warranty. These guys are at least honest and try to help you out. Thanks again Avondale toyota! Big Service requirements, I will bring the corolla to you!

Usually subway is pretty basic and clean as was this one. My problem was the blonde girl behind the counter slamming everything around because she had to "stay ten minutes past her shift"...  Welcome to America where Jobs are tough and you may have to go above and beyond even if it sucks.  So super slammer pulled my bread out slammed the glass, then when I asked for toasted the toaster door was slammed followed by a loud sigh. I'm pretty sure some black olives were harmed in the making of my sandwich. :(  Guy was very professional and laughing at the tissy fit, but kinda ruined it by awkwardly staring at me while waiting for the credit card machine to go through.   I am a fan of good regular service, not aggressive lettuce tossing.

Best fresh donuts around,kills dunkin in value and freshness + taste Good meat specials on thursday. I speak about 5 words in spanish and I do fine there. The eatery indoors is great, they have good specials but I forgot on which day. Homeade salsa is great! and on the weekends they do some sort of  cookoff out front with many great eats.  Not the best deals around at the actual market ( see wal mart) but the food, donut's and juice is to die for!  plus the tortillas are always fresh and warm, I always stock up from here.

suicide wings when we ordered hot. I have been to like 5 different Native's in AZ and these were by far the hottest wings I have ever had. Was it a cruel prank from the kitchen because they were slow? methinks not! Pizza was ok, leaning towards the too greasy side. Just not the best pizza sports bar time me and the wife have had out on the town. Don't think I will be back for round 2. Maybe they are better when they are packed...

If you have to go to a Wal Mart I say choose this one.  Pros:  You will not get into a hit and run in the parking lot.  You will not be in a 45 minute line.  There is not a cluster in every aisle the workers clean up well and the store is well organized.  You will not be hassled into buying a rap CD or knock off perfume in the parking lot  Cons:   Bad place for People of  Walmart photo's - everyone seems normal here  You do get shocked a lot like previously mentioned.  It's Wal Mart, crazy stuff is bound to happen

By far the best authentic chinese food I have had, keep in mind this is no PF changs, but it's the real deal. Polite on point service, and the food is fantastic. My drink was never empty, and my stomach was full and I was seriously pleased with my expierience, this place use to be located next to chipotle on 33rdish ave and peoria by metrocenter, the same family still works there minus the huge fish tank. I enjoy the general tso's chicken,  the mu shu wraps, and the orange chicken. This place is it!

The park ranger staff here is horrible. I was the only one to pay and about 30 minutes after everyone shows up the rangers are checking trunks and being sticklers about everything we were doing. They also extended the fire ban 5 days even though all the news outlets said it was lifted. Then proceeded to let every single party in the free non reserved Ramadas burn charcoal and cook food, yet for my paid reservation they gave me a bucket and demanded I put out the charcoal. Completely unprofessional staff, trash everywhere, and the icing on the cake they locked the bathrooms right next to my party because I said we were being treated unfairly. I will never rent a ramada there again for any party. Complete waste of time and money.

everything about my meal was awesome. If you are on a diet and deserve a cheat, this is the haven for you! The ingredients were fresh, the wait staff was friendly, and the prices were not absurd. Everything about this place I enjoy, and I am glad they are receiving all the attention by the food network and news. Sweet greasy goodness, there really isn't much more to say :)

Definatly not worth the bill you will be paying at the end of the meal. I have had better elsewhere for way less, try habuki or ra for more satisfaction. They like to charge here for stuff others give for free. It was a big dissapointment, but there philly rolls saved them from a one star.

Totally good experience, for non over seasoned and salty food. Great layout and good customer service. Obviously they have been making changes because the other reviews do not do proper justice. Worth the time for a quick cheap meal.

Ok so we went here on a saturday night and it was fairly busy everywhere at Westgate. When we walked in we were greated and told it would be a 20 min. wait, fine by me seeing that this place was packed. 45 minutes later after complaining to the hostess that she had her timing off, she explained to me why everyone was getting seated before me. She said there is no wait to sit at the sushi bar, well thanks for letting me know when I walked in lady. I honestly think we were the last people to sit down for the night out of the 12 groups that came in before or after us, mostly after. So then we sat and waited 5 minutes for our waiter to come to our table, ordered a round of beers and It took over ten minutes for him to come back, then he explained that they had to change out the tap, once again they should have told me this in half the time. So we ordered a bunch of sushi, a big mix and it was quite enjoyable but not the best ever. Halfway through our meal we ordered another round, it took 8 minutes, maybe they changed the tap faster that time. After noticing that we were frustrated with the amount of time we have spent there waiting to be seated, get food, and our drinks the waiter backed off and was more interested in other tables than seeing if we needed anything. So then we asked the manager if we could tab out because we are ready to go. Within two minutes the waiter is at our table asking if we need anything and that he really appreciates that we stopped in, and that he is sorry for being so busy.  So you were chewed out and now your trying to save your tip great, lucky we give 20% everytime no matter what because I wanted to give nothing, and almost broke my rule.  So key pointers here; Good sushi, bad hostesses wo care more about gossip tha being honest about your wait time or explaining the restaurant, Understaffed, Overcrowded with a loud younger crowd (not the place you would go for a peacefull night out) and Lacking service. I am going to give it another try in the next few days and update my review on if it changed at all. Hope this helps!

Omg horchata ice cream!!!  This is probably the best ice cream joint in the Phoenix area... I have been to churn and many others and the taste and quality just seems to stand out here at Pink Spot. I love the pink spot (pun intendo) They also have wonderful blended shakes, banana splits, and dipped bacon or cheesecake. It's everything you could ever want in an ice cream shop and I love it. I would certainly recommend this to all of my Yelp friends as well as IRL friends.

Winner Winner Chicken Fried Dinner!  Thank you other yelponies for leading me to this glorious fine dining palace. I really doubted this place was any good from the outside and honestly the reviews pushed me to try and it really is as good as it gets in the Goodyear area.   My wife and I ordered the pork lo mein, the orange chicken, and the general tzou's chicken. All three dishes were decently priced, well flavored, and had generous portions.   The lo mein had the perfect amount of oil texture with strong authentic flavor and wonderful tasting pork strips.  The orange chicken tasted more of citrus then of spice which is my wife's ideal plate ( I had to dump chili oil on it, BAM, but it was very good with or without it)   The General's chicken did not surrender and was fantastic with the perfect amount of spice and seasoning while surrounded by well placed and cooked broccoli.   Dishes range from 7-10 dollars each most in the middle of the range at 8.95  The culture inside of the restaurant was nice and classy and reminded me of those trips overseas stopping all over Asia.   This is bar far the best I have had in goodyear and is more than worth the try.

This is the wife and I's favorite date spot for a quick, healthy, and enjoyable meal at a good price point. My favorite dish here is the spicy chicken pita and I can't seem to get away from it because It's SOOO Good. My wife usually gets the chicken schwarma or the beef gyro and they both are also very good ( snuck some bites). The service has always been top notch and the orders have always been spot on. While sometimes we have to wait 15 minutes to grab a seat the food has always been worth the wait. The bathrooms are clean for the most part and the decor fits my style. The only downside is the parking situation because there are not a ton of spots.   One last tip - The green tea is unique and awesome

Let me start off by saying I love the vans metro location, but honestly this one is not up to par. I walked into the store today with full intent of purchase and was ignored for over 40 minutes while I browsed. I feel it was because I look young and older seasoned, more rich looking customers were coming in. I was skipped over at least 3 times and never even greeted or asked if I want help. The store is crammed and not well organized and the staff seemed pushy to the customers they were talking to. Eventually I walked out, and that hurts being the avid golfer I am. I will stick to the Vans Metrocenter location from now on and suggest it to other Yelpers. They did not stock the Club I was looking for but some assistance would have went a long way.   On a good note the store did have some good deals going, and seemed to be helping the regulars just fine...

This is by far the best Ross in Arizona, and I have been to about 15 total. They are always neat, organized, well staffed, and not a disaster. There is never a line wrapping around the store and I have found a great mix of the stuff I love here at a good price. I have bought Nike compression running pants, elite socks, discount athletic shoes, work shoes, work clothes, and so much more all usually on Ross clearance which is better price wise new then buying from Savers or goodwill. How cool is that? This Ross has won many awards and I believe they deserve all of the trophies framed behind the main register. I'd rather drive a bit to shop this Ross, then one of the bad Ross stores on Litchfield road (due to selection and organization) . The staff at Litchfield is great, but that's about it.

The wife and I went here for a New Years dinner for two... it's pretty much the only fine dining place in Goodyear outside of the Wigwam (and they only had NYE dinners that night). I feel bad that the company around us got more of our attention then the chef at the table but it defiantly was an enjoyable experience. The price point is average for Teppanyaki dinner and the service here is top notch. I had no issues on my order or anything simple like refills or cleanliness. The sushi was well crafted and the steak and chicken combo with fried rice was quite tasty. Probably the best fried rice I have had in the valley of the sun. My wife enjoyed her Mai Tai's and dish as well. This is a nice place to have a unique date night and I would suggest that yelper's give it a try.

I am a big time fan of this small Torta shop in Avondale and I really enjoy their food as it gets me away from mainstream Mexican food joints and into a touch of something different. I have tried 3 different torta's and have yet to have a menu item there that I did not thoroughly enjoy. They have fresh ingredients and love to use the avocado in many plates which is killer if your are a fan. They also choose to use higher quality meats in their menu items as you get ribeye tacos and a better cut of pork. I tried their super nachos last night and though they were different and used actual nacho cheese I really enjoyed the dish as well, and it was loaded with meat, cheese, and guacamole. The salsa bar has some real fire kicking salsas so be mindful not to dump it in your sammy or you will get burned on both ends. The service is great and friendly, it's always clean, and you won't feel like an outsider if you come with friends or family to eat a meal here. I would recommend this to my yelp friends.

Oh my! I thought long and hard about not doing a review for this place but it just rubbed us the wrong way. Let me start out on a positive note, the Hispanic waitress was real personable and on top of her game. She stepped in for our waitress who seem to disappear or always be on her cell phone.The owner should see these reviews and revamp their cell phone policy.   The decor was very nice and the place felt warm and inviting, when I walked in I wanted to give this place a great review that is until we actually ate. We ordered two sandwiches but wanted some wings to come out first. after about 25 minutes our sandwiches were ready and I overheard our waitress telling the cook (who was eating in the kitchen visibly)  that we were supposed to have wings first. Then she came to our table with a story about how they hadn't been prepped and would be another 8-10 minutes before they would be done. I was hungry and now had food and was curious to try them so I agreed that it would be okay. The story seemed made up on the fly but that's besides the point. It was over 15 minutes before we received the wings (not 8-10) and they were not cooked right at all, very squishy and gross. I'm never looking for anything for free but these late items usually save your company customers when comped and that wasn't even a thought.   My sandwich was good but was over packed with ingredients and even though I originally turned away silverware, when I needed it our waitress was texting at the bar. My wife's sandwich was packed full of mayo, and pre made, not very appetizing. By that time we just wanted to leave, especially with the cook staff wheeling the trash through the restaurant and stopping to flirt with the texting waitress leaving the overflowing trash feet from our table. Nothing about our experience made us want to come back again except our fill in waitress who helped out in the beginning.On another positive note the bar tender seemed friendly and professional.

I think the other guy was kinda harsh, this place is kept fairly clean, and you can't be at the price. Ordering to go is the real deal in my eyes, we ordered 6 large custom pizzas, a large order of cheesesticks, and a large order of cinnamon rolls for 42 dollars flat. Perfect for fight night with the friends. They made everything fresh, did not skimp, and had me verify that every single pizza was correct and looked ok. They always have a friendly staff, and are always fairly tidy. Yes the crowd sometimes can be a little off the normal, and the pizza is not always glamorous, but it's very cheap, and top rated for healthy dining in mens health magizine. The manager is a nice guy, we have talked to him a few times before, and he runs a good establishment, and seems to keep the staff in good spirits/ help when needed. I think the guy below kinda shaftd them on the stars so I gave them a extra one. You can have them make you anything you want, but my top 3 favorite pizza's are the deep dish pep., the macaroni, and the buffalo wing / sausage are tied for 3rd. The also have white pizzas that are a healthier option I believe. Overall it's a good plce for a fast easy and cheap meal. I hope you guys enjoy it.

The Dubliner is gone :( but dang I found a better joint in the process!  First off I am not a fan of fish from the good old days in the navy where I ate some of the worst fish ever on the planet! But you need to order the fish and chips here if you like fried treats and maybe can stand a slight fish taste as long as its golden brown. BOOM this was the best fish and chips meal I have ever had, I even heard the waitress boasting to the Sun City folk that they are the number 2 seller in the US of friken A of fish and chips plates and I defiantly know why in this case. They say this is Guinness brazed fried fish, but I have a feeling it's way more top secret than that. Try this place on the non all you can eat days because you will be waiting an hour to get in (friday / saturday) just to scarf some good eats down. This is due to only one fryer in the kitchen (another note I overheard). The only flaw I tasted was the coleslaw which could have had a bit more mayo or taste, was a bit dry. The chips were perfect, and the fish was downright awesome. Once you have tried this place then you can venture there when it's packed and enjoy a cold one with me ! I will update soon when I can go there and not order the fish and chips (maybe in 2012) Check it, wreck it...

I agree a lot with the other poster on cleanliness, so to go is the way to do it here. They deserve 4 stars for there carne asada chimi changa, I was not even a fan and was lost to order one day so I decided to give it a try. They have mastered it! I am hooked for life and get one every 2-3 weeks. The shreded beef hard tacos are good, the carne asada burros are my wifes favorite around town from there. They have great food, just need to clean up a little more, and perfect there orders, yes sometimes they do make mistakes but I will let it slide because of there awesome chimi's

What a nice place to hold an event ! My wife and I went for the Yelp Western Adventures party and had a absolute blast!  The venue was large and could comfortably hold 250- 300 people in my opinion and has plenty to do for all types of people. The decor was nice with a western flare and the booked music did great for the whole night. There was plenty of seating and even some nice spots to tuck away from all of the crowds and enjoy the Arizona skyline / stars.  I would come back for an adult education night to see what else they have to offer and would recommend this venue to large party weddings and those who want to get away from the city grind.

Pros : Great Pizza, food, Service, and Atmoshphere  Cons: Pricey with no combo of pizza & wings specials   You can tell their management team is very expirienced.  well deserved 4 stars and worth a try.

Sears had an fantastic sale for memorial day and to skip the store lines I stopped by this little shop to see if my fridge meltdown could be saved. I ended up saving around 500 on a new fridge and the service there was very personal and nice. This is how stores should be and they set a fine example of taking care of the customer even though they may not buy, we told the associate we were going to compare prices at the next door Lowes but returned within 15 minutes to buy the better deal (by a large amount) I scheduled delivery and was in and out very fast. Great service and deals with a real personal touch. I'm a fan.

Very clean and friendly spot in south phoenix that I will most likely visit again. I wanted so bad to give four stars but will most likely review again on my second visit. The soda I wanted was out in the machine and the surf and turf burro was supposed to have chipotle shrimp and it seemed like it was missing sauce or seasoning on it. Everything else I saw there looked very good and I wish I had more time on my original visit to study the menu to order the wipeout burro which looks fantastic and has a yelp deal. The counter staff and cooks are all very friendly and well kept and you can tell they are trying their best to put a good light on their establishment. The salsa was fresh and tasted very good. The burrito was a good portion and filled me up for the rest of the day. The crane Asada and Quac tasted great. Overall I would recommend this place to those looking for a good bite where good restaurants are hard to find area wise.

Quite the service with a smile. They seemed happy and welcoming once I came in and overall I am glad I gave them a chance. I usually make the trip to GhetroCenter because they have the best Barbers in the greater phoenix area in my opinion. Well this was very close to the cut quality I would get from there. He did exactly what I wanted, then cleaned my line up with a straight razor. Good casual conversation and it ended with a 2 minute electronic massage. Great place to go if you live in Goodyear (17 dollar cut)

I used the Shutterbox Photobooth at a Yelp event and it was so awesome it's the only personalized review I'll be doing from the whole night. They had many western themed props and I was in and out with my wife in a matter of minutes. The quality of prints was above average, the service was fantastic, and the web site was easy to navigate and find our pictures. This would be perfect for a reunion, birthday, or fun new aged wedding. I would recommend using this service to all my other yelp buddies.

Super Huge with fresh sushi to boot!  Very large with great Fry's deals and super fresh and stocked produce. I have never went to find anything advertised out of stock, which has happened to me before at other locations. Friendly cashiers, and really nothing bad to say at all. Even a low cost gas station who's prices rival Costco if you are a frequent shopper.

Their service was great even though I was asking many questions and trying out about every golf club they sell knowing very well I was going to buy it online cheaper. I liked talking sports with the employees and everyone seems friendly and pays good attention to the customers needs. I have been to very bad S.A. before when its impossible to find help once you pass the front counter, but this is an exemption. If you have to visit one I suggest stopping by at this one.

What a diamond in the rough! I swear this is one of the best blocks for food I haven't tried on the west side. Well after trying to find somewhere quick to eat on the one hour break from a nearby hospital I saw a nice review for Mike's Bistro and decided to check it out. I read the specials posted out front, and Mike is right... "Life is too short to eat bad food"  I am very happy with my venture into this small business and I hope more people make it in because this was absolutely great food. The wife had an eggplant parmigiana sub, and I had a pulled pork chipotle Torta, and they were both in the 6 dollar range but oh so fantastico! Mike was very polite and the restaurant was clean and tidy.   The experience was authentic as was the food, and honestly this is one of the best places I have ever eaten that wasn't high priced.  Check out Mikes, and support local business with some great eats!

There are many valuable tips from the reviews on this festival, I will try to hit some bases left untouched.  At one point I was hungry and just wanted to buy food from the truck we liked the best. When we passed through the 15 minute line I asked if we could put in a order and pay for it. I was told samples only.... totally lame that I would have to wait and wait and wait just to feel full.  I found a little pink BBQ truck with cinnamon infused sauce on their meat and a very small line and hit them up a good 5 times over the night to try and get my food value out of the night.  The two hotdog trucks both did a very good job on both keeping food coming out to the people, and customizing to keep everyone happy.  The dirt atmosphere was harsh at times for this reason... you would be in line eating some tots and then be hit with a breeze of dirt.  No Tots and dirt please  Many trucks ran out of food early which seems to be unfair to both paying customers and other trucks in the area still cranking  If this becomes the norm, the good trucks will bring less food so everyone can relax after a certain hour, and the customers will miss out.  The live music was fresh, but sometimes they were playing over other music on speaker, weaksauce.  they need to have a bigger location because the lines were out of control and half the battle would be finding the right line for truck.   I almost gave it 3 stars because I did have some good food and at 10 when we left we defiantly had our money worth. Twas a decent date night because were more on the relaxed side, but I could defiantly see many frustrated people just give up after complaining the whole time.   Lets hope they make some key changes for the next one...

I love everything about this place, and frequent it often for many reasons. The wait staff is always in a good mood, and pays attention to you even if the place is packed. The food is original, different than the run of the mill bar, and the craft beers are on point. You can try many beverages without breaking the bank. For $1 you can sample the many local and foreign brews. On the weekend you can stop in for a $10 brunch which includes a drink. They have good bbq, great appetizers, and I haven't had anything I didn't really enjoy and that's a serious plus. For their brunch the flatbread with breakfast on top rocks my socks. I would suggest this to my friends and I'll see you there! :)

When I check out brand new restaurants I try to stray away from the bad initial reviews and form my own but this place is far from making the cut in my opinion but I do see hope if they fix a few errors. First off, the food does not taste authentic and seems like many ingredients are from a can and is way too "tex-mex" for my palate. The design and cleanliness is above average but many of of the dishes fell short of my expectations weighed against the cost of our meal. The plates do seem to mimic fine dining where you order the sides for a cost, usually included at places like Macayos or Garcias. The triple dip appetizer had burnt chips with little salt and bland guac. The spicy shredded adovada pork was tasty but the meat was dry and stiff, and the desert menu was weird and lacked descriptions. The service was rushed and for the last half of the meal she completely forgot about us. A young man came to our table and asked if everything was alright and if we needed anything and I said no seeing that I was in the middle of a conversation when he interrupted. Our waitress finally came with the check with a flustered look on her face like we were not going to tip her. We did, but this is probably not a place we will try again unless the bulk of reviews turns a 180.

This was one great laid back bar. I went for a Yelp event and arrived early due to thinking there would be more traffic on the I-10. I ended up walking around the well designed and furnished bar to see nice wood accents, clean well kept pool tables, and a happy go lucky staff that was willing to get me anything I wanted and always wore a smile. I ended up drinking a few four peaks Kilt lifters before I decided on what I wanted and maybe the overdose of carbs led me to the santa fe type chicken salad that was great. The chicken was moist and blackened with the right amount of spice and the lettuce and toppings were super fresh. After dinner I tried a few new 4 peaks creations and hopped on the nearest pool table for some after dinner fun with the brew masters. The environment was always nice, music at the right level and plenty to watch on tv including my favorite ( UFC ). When I made it back to the table there were a plethora of desserts and I could not resist trying them and on the real I am so glad I did. The brownie with vanilla bean and coffee ice cream was to die for and also the brownie cake with peanut butter. Just super mouth watering sugar-tastic goodness all around.  I would defiantly go back to this place, and will be sure to bring my friends next time I'm in the area.  Be sure to check this joint out!

Don't get all the early hate on this place or maybe they changed their ways with some of the earlier tips. I came in and ordered a large pulled pork sandwich Memphis style and sat back to enjoy the military / family themed place unfolding in front of me. The smoker was in full tune and what seemed to be father and daughter worked on the orders coming in. It took me less than 6 minutes to get my BBQ meal so I don't get the complaining about time restraints and surely the food was worth the wait when it comes to BBQ options in Goodyear. When I finally sunk into my meal it was tangy with a kick and super delicious. Everything about the experience was good, and everything delivered with good timing and a genuine smile. I think this place will be a hit if more people swing by and the food is defiantly both good and outside of the normal.  The only con I had was that I left the place after maybe 7 minutes and smelled like smoked BBQ for the next 8 hours even after a shower. I wish there was some way around this but for BBQ that good the juice is worth the squeeze.

Bar none the best customer service experience I have ever had. I always go here for my customs fittings and every time I walk through the door I feel just as important as a professional player. They tell you everything you need to know about what clubs you need and even offer a bit of advice on you could get the most out of every shot.  I have been fitted for putters, irons, and woods and even made adjustments afterwards with no hassle at all.  If you are thinking about becoming a more serious golfer you should consider a custom fit. This is the place to go if you want the best around.

This place has my name all over it. I can eat tasty treats and still count calories / stay healthy without much work at all. They have about 14 flavors every time I go in there with the calorie count posted right on the wall which is a dream for the wife and I who watch everything we eat like hungry hawks. I have had about 4 different low calorie flavors and every single one has not only been super fresh, but super awesome. They always have plenty of fruits, treats, nuts, and sauces fully stocked. I even saw some Siracha that I had to ask about ( apparently goes well on the mango sorbet) which was crazy. The price point is fair, and I seem to pay less here than other nearby yogurt shops and this is one of the only one I have ever been to without any empty bins of treats and toppings. Honestly the toppings here top all! Be sure to check out this local joint and you will most likely see me dominating some frozen delight in the parking lot before I make it to the car to drive home :)

Solid help with a no gimmicks approach. The DR. was completely helpful with his explanation of what they offer for the right now and the future. Everything he was in the process of doing was explained as well to help ease the process. The office was perfectly clean and professional with calming music playing in the background but not too long. I haven't felt this good in years but thankfully I can now fall to sleep with ease. Great joint and it's defiantly worth giving a try. Snap crackle and pop your way in when you get some free time.

We have eaten here a good 4-5 times in the last few months and I believe they have been listening to their review to fix smaller issues. I absolutely love their food and the wife does too. We have tried a few different plates and have no real complaints as of yet. We can usually get out of there with 2 dinners and a app. for under 35 dollars so the price point is less than some of the competing Greek joints in the Goodyear / Avondale area. This seems like a family run joint and the service has always been fantastic and I always feel super welcome when I'm here. I have had no issues with absurd waiting or problems with my order. This is a great joint on our side of town and I would suggest it to my Yelp buddies.

Super fast service with a great friendly staff. We usually order online and pick it up here, and they blow chipotle out of the water in online order timing and accuracy. They have plenty of options and their food is always fresh. I have never sat in, but this is a good option for the Goodyear crowd that needs a fast meal.

Let me give a true review on my pizza going experience.   Dicarlos Pizza was unlike any pizza I ever had. It was thin crust and the sauce tasted different and home made. The cheese was high quality but wasn't completely melted on my pizza. I was one of two customers and it took about 20 minutes for me to get my 3 cut (box slices) of pizza. The pepperoni topping I choose to put on top was cold, and seemed to be just tossed on last second. There was no water cups available so you have to pay for a drink no matter what. They don't even have cups here. The taste of the pizza was good but not the best in the area. I'd prefer others that aren't more than 5 minutes away. I honestly think this place could get better with some minor fixes. I'd start with a bit quicker and more polite service. Maybe if they cooked the pizza with the toppings it would be better as well. We sat outside and felt ignored, even had to go inside to retrieve our pizza. Ill check this place out in a few months, but for now I won't be recommending it to other yelpers.

Great new business to the Avondale Goodyear area. I enjoyed the service, the restaurant was very clean and well kept, my order was spot on and very tasty. The price point is very fair and your could easily get dinner for 2 under $20. I enjoyed the house fried rice and the pad Thai the most. The PHO is also authentic and very good here. Everyone seemed pleased with their order and the service seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was correct and what the customers wanted when they originally ordered. They do not accept checks but do take cards and checks. I would say it's perfect for groups of 6 and under as it's not a very large restaurant. I liked pretty much everything about this place and would recommend it to my fellow local yelpers. Pho k yeah!

4 star food with 0 star service so I compromised. We walked in and questioned if anyone even worked there. We waited about 5 minutes before I had to walk over to the bartender and ask if it was self seating. I was told that they have to clear the tables which were full and that's why we weren't sitting yet. Thanks... I guess? So we finally sit and its 15 minutes before were asked what we want to drink and are given menus. About 10 minutes later the bar tender walks up and says "I'm not your waiter but I'll help you" the girl that was supposed to be our waiter was in her own world staring at the POS system like she was having problems creating people checks, but I think she just didn't want to face all the mad diners looking impatient around me. People that walked in 15-20 minutes after me are already getting Togo boxes and pretty much the same issue was present with the table next to us. We came in five minutes after him yet finished eating before he received his food. There was no order or massive issues in the kitchen or both. Even a walk up Togo order was in and out quickly, but the man was complaining about receiving the wrong food. The waitress seemed to argue back with customers or give excuses. It was very unacceptable customer service wise. I will never go back or recommend this place even though the food was good. Near the end of the meal we were told the food was great (which it was) but the service was horrible (also true) by a staff member. Why can't you fix it if you know it's wrong? If you order take out I would suggest the street tacos as they are all very good. If the restaurant isn't busy I'm sure the service doesn't struggle (as I've experienced the first time I went in) but when I returned on a date to careless and horrible service I know it's not worth my time to return.

Went there twice and both times the workers seemed confused / flustered / annoyed. The lady on the register gave us the wrong number plate so our sandwiches went who knows where. The first time I was upsized to a large when I ordered a medium but paid for the large, swipe and go mistake on my part I guess. The second time we waited almost 40 minutes for our two subs because they messed our order up, and then forgot to make it again. This place needs serious reform.

So far we have tried this hut 4 times and I have yet to have any issues listed below.   I usually order the carne asada either in a burro or on chips and they are usually the best around here in the great Goodyear tire.  Wife has had shredded beef Tacos, surf and turf, or the super fries.   I suggest ordering it without the salsa fresca and just using their red sauce because it makes it better.  Food has always been hot, and a reasonable value and I have not had any issues with service so far. Food has not made me sick, but then again I have eaten around the world and I believe I'm fairly immune to the taco bug.  Check this hot spot out, I think it's worth it.
