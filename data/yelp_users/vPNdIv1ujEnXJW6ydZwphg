I just found this local gem and love it!  The prices for stationary are very reasonable and the staff is very helpful and sweet.

Besides the great drinks, Saffron JAK pizza is now being served at Sidebar. The super greeky pizza is AMAZING!

Dr. Brian Harris is the best dentist and one of the best docs I have ever worked with as a patient.  This dentistry and customer service are unparalleled.  I've never had a bad experience in ten years and highly recommend Harris Dental.

I thought the Henry was a place to come have meetings. When you are half way done and asked to leave to another area to set up for a private event, you should be courteous and why not have a sign letting people know?  It's 107 degrees outside so offering for us to sit outside isn't a great option.
