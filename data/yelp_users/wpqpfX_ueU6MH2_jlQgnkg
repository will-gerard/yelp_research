Despite the fact that I lived down the street from this museum, driven, ran and rode my bike past it 100 times, I never noticed it.  This partly because my interest is not piqued by fire or fire trucks, and partly because it is well-hidden in the shrubs of Papago Park.  But, I must say, it was a pleasantly surprising treat - and surprisingly large.  First, beware that the large bell by the front door does indeed work, very loudly, so resist the urge to bang it.  The museum has everything from antique fire trucks, to pictures and medals, to a kids' play area.  It even has a fire pole that you can slide down. The only thing sadly missing is the firemen.  The first gallery is filled with historic fire trucks that are so old, they are not even trucks.  They are carriages!  That were once pulled by horses!  The second gallery is filled with old fire trucks, including a large truck that kids (and adults) are allowed to climb on.  The third gallery is filled with more trucks and includes a child's play area. My kids really enjoyed playing in this area, we had to tear them away after nearly two hours.  The air conditioning is not stellar, so its humid and stuffy in there, but it still beats the 110-degree temperature outside.  The last gallery includes (yup - you guessed it!) MORE fire trucks. It also shows a 70s equipped dispatch center. Even though the computers and switchboard are decades old, the calls coming in are very real, as they are the real calls currently going to dispatch.  And then there are also lots of photos and medals displayed on the walls, fire safety videos and information, clothing and hats for the kids to wear, among either trinkets and visuals.  Having never been a 7-year old boy, my interest in fire trucks can only be stretched so far, but for $6, this was definitely worth the excursion, and my kids and husband loved it.

OK Costco, I love you. You should know this if you read the review I accidentally posted under Costco Gas for this location.  I love your $2 monstrous pizza slices, knock off Lululemon yoga pants, bags of baby kale, and free samples.  I love that I can put any and all purchases on the Costco Amex card and my husband has no idea what I bought.  BUT.  It is time for some tough love.  What the heck are you doing to the bananas???  I mean, I know the sign says, "Control Ripening Technology" but this so-called "technology" is making your bags of bananas turn into bags of banana mush.  Basically, I buy the bananas. I leave them in the bag. The bag assures me that moisture in the bag is good for my bananas.  But, THE BAG IS WRONG.  My bananas get soggy. The peel falls off. The banana turns brown.    If I try to eat the bananas immediately, when I break one off, it breaks away the peel from the other bananas because the moisture has made the skin weak and useless. So now I have a bunch of partly unpeeled bananas.  It is madness.    I will cut you slack because they are insanely cheap and you give me free samples of tuna fish on fancy crackers, but Costco, it is time to reject that stupid technology and put the holes back in the bag. Or, just stop selling bananas because as of right now you are reeking havoc on our local garbage men who are forced to deal with garbage cans full of bananas mush.  I know, in the realm of trash, banana mush is seemingly innocent, but that stuff LEAKS.  Then you step in it and your shoe becomes squeaky. The mush leaks onto other bags  and then you have banana mush laden trash that attracts fruit flies.  Nothing annoys me more than fruit flies. (And, apparently I speak for all trash men.)  FIX THE BANANAS.  Thanks!

The other day at gymnastics, the teacher asked all the kids about their favorite restaurants. Every kid said McDonalds - until mine.  They both answered Souper Salad.  It is a less fancy sweet tomatoes, and their soups are not nearly as good, but the price is unbeatable.  They have regular coupons and on Wednesdays, kids eat for $2.  The salad bar is pretty good and even has options that Sweet Tomatoes does not (like cottage cheese).  The salad bar is always clean and stocked. The staff is always polite, friendly and remove our dishes promptly.  The pizza runs out often but lately it has been replaced very timely (my daughter loves  their pizza). They also sometimes have steamed broccoli with cheese, which is great for getting kids to eat vegetables.   For dessert, they offer pound cake and strawberries for strawberry shortcake topped with soft serve ice cream.  For $6 (the average coupon price), you walk out of there very full, content and with happy kids.

It almost seems pointless to review a big box retail store, but I have issue with this location and how my items ring up.  I will use yesterday as a short but accurate example:  I went to purchase a picture frame with my daughter.  We bought this and 3 spontaneous purchases.  The 3 additional purchases were frivolous and cheap, however it was the bright red SALE sign that attracted to me to these items.  And, at the register, none of them rang up at the advertised sale price.  Supposedly the popcorn was on sale for $2.50. It rang up at the normal price of $3.29.  The watermelon oreos, which everyone has claimed are gross but are surprisingly good, were on sale for $2.80, but rang up for $3.  And lastly, I bought some sour patch flavored gum, on clearance at the register for 60-cents, yet rang up for .99 cents.  YES, THEY DO HAVE SOUR PATCH FLAVORED GUM.  I didn't say anything at the register because I am not going to hold up a line over an extra $1.29 total.  Nor am I going to waste my time standing in customer service to embarrass myself over $1.29.  But, the problem is that this is exactly what Target expects from us.  They basically overcharge ALL OF US every time we shop there.  Sure, in minimal amounts, but does that make it right?  It was Sunday so  it is very conceivable that this particular store simply did not update their sale advertisements throughout the store and it's more of an issue with location rather Target itself.  Hence the yelp review.  Since they have sour patch flavored gum and watermelon oreos (and yes, I realize I  have taste buds like a 6 year old), I will probably return anyway.  Just be wary of the sale signs - they mean nothing.

I really enjoy birthday cakes and I have to say that Fry's can make a good cake. In fact, when put in front of me next to a similar cake from AJ's, I cannot tell a difference (since I am not a spring chicken anymore, I have had many cakes from both places, although I do love AJ's).    My mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.  If you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?     Needless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive.

My house has termites (I know, gross) and so I called our regular exterminators (City Wide) for a quote. To do my due diligence and feel good about myself, I also called a second company for a quote. Just as always, City Wide scheduled an appointment (that fit my schedule), arrived on time TO THE MINUTE, and sent a very nice, knowledgeable exterminator.  They then quickly followed up with a very good price. I cannot say any of that about the other company, which just reminds me why I use City wide in the first place.  We have used them for years and I am surprised to see some of the negative reviews.   Our normal exterminator is a young guy named Alan. He is always so friendly, cheerful and oddly enthusiastic. I once suspiciously questioned him about this because I hate bugs more than my kids hate Brussels sprouts, and he shared with me a nostalgic childhood tale about killing ants in his driveway and always knowing in his heart that he was meant to be an exterminator.  I thought it was weird, but also reassuring because someone out there has to kill my bugs.  I am thankful for Alan and for all the bug-killers like him as I look forward to next Saturday when they kill my stupid termites.

One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle.   My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the "good old days" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.  Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.    But!  You also get a cowboy hat.  I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).  As for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.  For the meal, I had the "catch of the day" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.    But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating?   Probably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.

The best time to go to this Pita Jungle is happy hour (3-6).  Their happy hour menu was larger than I have seen at other locations.  A small plate of three different hummus? $1.  Two falafel balls?  $1.  Garlic chicken? $2.  Streamed mussels? $2.  Plus tons of other options...you could easily eat an entire meal there for just a couple of bucks.  The service was fine when we went - not even the slightest delay - but it was also in between meal times and not crowded.  However, the strip mall itself was packed.  It is always packed.  The parking lot stresses me out.  So, go at your own risk, and don't bother trying to park close.

hmm, hopefully I am reviewing the right thing...I am not sure if I was at the Bridal Fashion Debut or the Bridal Expo or the Phoenix Bridal Fashion show... there were SO many people, SO many wedding dresses, SO many people handing me photography brochures....it all became a white, fuzzy, bedazzled, blur.  However, I am sure that I was at a wedding event at the Phoenix Convention Center.  The fashion show was fun, and at the end, all the models through plastic flower bouquets into the crowd. Each bouquet = a prize. I am not sure what the prizes were (could  have been a $5 coupon or a gold ring) because even though I caught a bouquet (it landed on my face), someone from behind grabbed it, scratching my face and shoulder with her untrimmed nails.  "You just scratched me!" I told her.  She didn't care, she was too busy jumping up and down with glee.  So, if you sit through the fashion show, be  very careful when they throw the bouquets. You may be seated by a hungry animal with claws.  Speaking of hungry, there was a variety of food vendors there sampling their popular wedding dishes (pulled pork, tacos, beans and pork, pasta, bbq pork, pork on rice...I guess pork is popular). There were also a few vendors passing out wine and margaritas. The problem was the cup sizes - they were so small!  I recommend bringing a flask, or two flasks, depending on how well you handle crowds.  I was looking forward to sampling wedding cake (I am not getting married, but one of my main duties as MOH is sampling wedding cakes, and I take that job very seriously).  But there was only ONE vendor sampling cake!  And it was mediocre cake at best, with icing that tasted like it came from the grocery store. I am not dissing grocery store icing, but no one wants to look back at their (expensive) wedding pictures to see their mouth covered with grocery store level icing. No, they want to want to see the best cake they ever tasted with icing they dreamt about for years, being shoved into their mouth.  There was also one vendor sampling mini-cupcakes. Honestly, they looked so....mini.  But, considering at times the event was so crowded that the aisles resembled more of a mosh pit than a walk-way, I understand that it is hard to serve delicate samples of cake. And just imagine - if people were willing to claw face over plastic flowers, it would be a blood bath over delicious, beautiful cake.  The Phoenix bridal show/expo/debut did offer a lot of good deals, heavily discounted dresses, raffles, and chocolate kisses.  If you can handle large crowds and a little a violence (or, if you just really like pork), it is a worthwhile couple hours if you are planning a wedding.

I suspect that my house may have termites so I called two companies for quotes.  The first company, my regular pest controllers, scheduled quickly and arrived promptly (I believe they came 1 minute early).  The second provider, AZ Exterminating, did not schedule a time like the first company. Instead, they scheduled a window of 3-5pm. This is always annoying but whatever, my husband left work early.  At 5:05, they still had not showed so we called to find out they were not coming.  So, we scheduled again, this time for 7am.  I set my alarm early to get ready early to accommodate this.  Now it is 7:43 and they are still not here, and I have yet to receive a phone call.  There is nothing more frustrating than feeling as if your time is not valued.  Even if they spray the best magical bug poison in the world, it means nothing if they cannot schedule a visit and actually show up.    ETA: 7:46am and they showed up - but now my daughter is up and we have to get ready for school (and work for me).  I changed my original 1-star review to a 2-star review since they did at least show, even if it was too late.  I wish I had a life leisurely enough to sit around all day and wait for the bug man while watching Bravo tv shows.

I went to Sweet Tomatoes last night at the Scottsdale location.  And it's not even worth reviewing that location because it is so normal.  There is nothing particularly good about it, nor bad about it.    But THIS location, THIS location has things worth mentioning. And so here I  go:  1) They have a super soda machine that makes 100 flavors. I always do the diet mellow yellow grape. 2) They have abnormally fancy plates. 3) They have cottage cheese at the salad bar. I like cottage cheese. 4) They have chocolate (or sometimes strawberry) mousse at the salad bar. Other Sweet Tomatoes have this as well, but they put it by the ice cream, alluding that it is a dessert.  Moving the mousse to the salad bar implies that it is meant to be eaten with your salad.  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DINNER. I should just end this review right here. 5) They serve beer. 6) They serve meat on wooden sticks (but you have to pay more). 7) They changed their corn muffins into delicate little corn cakes. 8) It is by a very interesting pond that has an abundance of turtles. One day, they make take over the world.

My husband and I were on a search for a place to bring out laptops while the grandparents watched the kiddos for a bit.  I know, it's not the most thrilling use of a kid-free Saturday afternoon, but at least we ordered a coffee - caffeine after 2pm is a little edgy?  Ok, so maybe not, but at least we ventured some place new rather than Starbucks.  And apparently ordering caffeine after 2pm is normal behavior for young folk these days because nearly every table and chair were taken.  There is not a ton of seating because the place is very compact, but you can also perceive it to be cute, charming, quaint and comfortable.  There is a small living setup with an old bookcase, books and board games hidden around the corner. This is where we able to find a table. There are also tables outside for the overflow.  The menu was good - coffee and flavorings with an impressive bakery display that I pretended did not exist because I am not Day 6 of a sugar-reduced diet.  There was a friendly girl working the counter, a clean bathroom, and free wifi.  Everything was looking like a five star review until the coffee was a little more than half way gone...the caffeine put me in "work" mode, my head was down, I was working ferociously....and then the wifi dropped.  I immediately blamed my stupid computer but then I looked up to see that everyone's computer displayed the same "cannot load webpage" message.  The internet stayed down so I left, and my table was immediately overtaken by young hipsters.  I enjoy the offbeat path so I would go back to this place, just probably not during the peak hours so that I could ensure a place to sit.

My kids had their birthday party at the Great Arizona Puppet Theater.  I don't think I have any negative things to say.  It is pretty straight forward: the birthday room has a craft table so that the kids can make their own puppets.  This is not exclusive to parties, there is another craft table outside the birthday room.  There is also a wall of homemade puppets displayed which makes you realize how creative and crafty kids are.  I made a puppet of my black and white cat and although I wish I had a better picture, I think I did good job capturing  his resentful, spite-filled eyes.  The kids watch the scheduled puppet show (and birthday kids get a moment on stage and a song) - for us, it was Old McDonald and it was very cute and age appropriate.  All the kids were laughing and singing along and aside for a crying baby, I think everyone really enjoyed it.  The show was short, perhaps 40 minutes from start to finish, and there are options to sit in a seat, or on the floor.  There is also a gift shop where you can purchase your own puppet, which are much more sophisticated than my cat, and books and other typical gift store stuff.  For birthday parties, the kids assemble back to the birthday room for food and cake. You have to bring your own but they have a fridge and freezer to keep everything cold.  There is also a wagon that you can use to transport your food to and from the car, which was a nice and thoughtful touch.  The birthday room is small so it's probably not the best idea for huge birthday parties.

I visited the PV Country Club to attend a CFA awards ceremony. My husband has been going to CFA luncheons for years now and I always live vicariously as I inquisitively ask him during dinner, "So what did they feed?  Was it good?  Did it come with a side dish?"  And most importantly, "Was there dessert?"  The luncheons are usually at country clubs, but not always the same one, and usually include a fancy dessert that my husband will recount as "something very tasty but I don't know what it is called." His answer always leaves me unsatisfied, which helps explain why I was excited that I finally would attend one!  This particular luncheon was everything that I expected: a slightly over air-conditioned banquet room, tables with fancy table cloths, two sizes of forks,  and beautifully plated salads set in front of every chair.  The country club in general was gorgeous, with views of the mountains, and lots of greenery.  It is a good place to pose for a picture.  The waitstaff was better than any waiter I ever had - our water cups were refilled before they were even half empty.  Our plates were taken away the second we appeared done.  The main course was chicken served on top of pasta with artichokes and a cream sauce.  It tasted like chicken in a cream sauce. But I am impressed with anything that comes garnished so I was happy.  Then we got to dessert. A single plate of cookies was placed in the center of every table.  I like cookies as much as the next person, but cookies are a snack, not a dessert.  I don't think I can blame this one on the country club as I am sure the cookies were selected off a menu, but it begs the question, why were cookies even on the menu?  It is a  very anti-climatic dessert option.  Most people must have agreed with me because very few attendees ate a cookie - most plates were untouched when we left the room.  So, I took a few for sampling.  They were decent cookies, but all were dry and crumbly. They were the type of cookie that need to be served with ice cream, or chocolate sauce, or milk, or even a cup of coffee.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed my experience and took two leftover cookies for the road (that crumbled and made a mess in my purse but I ate them anyway).

I brought home my Maltipoo from the county shelter after discovering she was going to be euthanized due to fear. Although she is very young, they believed she was a stray for a long time.  She quickly turned around but all attempts to groom her went horribly.  Her hair was tangled into sensitive dreadlocks, she she could barely see out of her eyes since her hair covered them. I was beginning to think she would have to stay that way.  Galloping Groomer felt like my last resort - I didn't care how she looked!  In fact, all I wanted was her dreadlocks to be removed, even if it left her hairless.  I was nervous  that she would be fear-ridden and they would not be able to hold her still enough to clean her, nonetheless deal with clippers or razors.  But Jodi arrived to my house with a confidence that never faltered. She knew how to handle my dog and removed her from the house with a smile on her face.  She did all the grooming in a large van in front of our house so my dog didn't have the additional stress of large rooms, numerous strangers, and other, much bigger, dogs.  When she knocked on my door a little bit later, she was holding a dog that was unrecognizable!  My dirty mop (with a tail) that smelled like a stale moth balls now looked like a large-eyed puppy with super-soft fur that smelled like flowers. Finally, I could see my dog's face.  By the next day, she was completely recovered and proudly strutting herself around the neighborhood with her tail up high.  Jodi was able to give her a better quality of life  that the others could not do - I strongly recommend her if your dog needs someone with a little extra skill and patience.

I am giving this review 5 stars partly on a leap of faith because it is still a developing business.  But so far, I like what I see and I see myself being a regular here.  I was familiar with Neos because of the funny radio commercials I heard on KissFM while driving to work.  I now have Sirius because the repeated Shane Company diamond commercials where causing me to bang my head into the dash board so often that it was creating a large dent.  But the Neos commercials were short, witty and appreciated.  However - this is the not the same Neos that you may be familiar with. This new Neos Medspa is under new ownership and management.    I was a little surprised with the small size of the new medspa, but I was also a little relieved.  I was always hesitant about certain procedures because you have to leave most of your modesty at the door and I am a rather modest person.  But the small staff (who are also the owners), and homely office, felt warming and welcoming.  It was definitely less intimidating than other medspas I have considered in the past.  Neos was very honest and straightforward with me, they did not try to sell me any product or convince me I needed anything extra. I am easily influenced when it comes to buying things, so this is something appreciated more so by my husband.  Since I have Sirius, I don't know if the new Neos Medspa has radio commercials or if they will have the same comical flair, but as long as Tom Shane is not involved, it won't be the most annoying thing on the radio.  If he is involved, I will be doing a review update.

I took some out-of-town family members to Four Peaks for quick dinner and beers.  It was not that quick, because even on Tuesday the place was packed, but as all the reviews state, the food was good and my family members enjoyed the beer.  I never acquired the taste for beer so I tried one of their "craft cocktails" per the waitress' suggestion.  This particular craft cocktail added muddled blueberries, blueberry vodka, and sweet and sour to the beer.  It ended up tasting like carbonated sweet and sour blueberry candy, and there is nothing wrong with that.  The waitress also helped my nephew (a food engineer) choose a hamburger.  He agreed with her, in front of his empty plate, that it was a good burger.  It was very tall.  There was one moment when my half-full craft cocktail and nearly full water cup sat in front of me. Across the table, a half-full beer and a half-full water cup sat across from my nephew.  Without any sudden movements, wild gesturing, movement of the table, person passing by, gust of wind, or flying bird - an almost filled cup fell on the floor. We were all startled by the loud sound of the glass breaking. The staff didn't miss a beat; seconds later, the glass and ice cubes were swept up and the floor was being mopped.  But, it begged the question, where did this random falling glass come from?  No one was missing a water cup or drink.  Nor did anyone see or feel the glass fall off the table.  Less than one minute later, the exact same thing happened at a few tables behind us!  Rumor is that the old building, which used to be a creamery, is haunted.   I don't believe in ghosts but I also don't have another suggestion.  Maybe the ghost from Casey Moore's came over to play?  Really, how many haunted bars can Tempe have!?

This was my first  time rock climbing in decades, and my husband's first time ever, so I cannot compare Phoenix Rock Gym to other rock gyms, or claim that it is better or worse.  By default, I gave it three stars because it offered everything it promised (rocks to climb) and then I gave it an extra star because I thought the staff was friendly and helpful.  I am also still alive.  I purchased a Groupon so it was very well priced. I thought that it would be fun to try something different but moreso, I was captivated with the thought of seeing my husband in a harness.  I was so consumed with excitement of the harness that I actually completely forgot that I am terrified of heights.  This is maybe not the best place to go if you are scared of heights because even though the walls are not *that* tall, like a mountain, they are pretty intimidating.   The staff makes you watch a video and then spends 5-10 minutes instructing you on how to safely attach yourself to the pully system and how to safely belay your partner (lower them down from the wall).  After that, they LEAVE YOU ON YOUR OWN.  This is probably more intimidating than the wall height because you are left to your own skills, or lack thereof.  But the whole thing is very safe, it would be actually pretty hard to let your partner fall.  The climbing is difficult if you are a beginner, but considering I have zero arm strength and usually start freaking out once I get to the third rung of a ladder, if I could get to the top of a few walls, anyone can. In fact, I saw kids under 10 scaling the walls.  The only real real criticism I have is the stuffy and humid air conditions of the room. I know it is summer, and that air conditioning is expensive, but a few fans  or something to help ventilation would have been nice.    It is very hard to take photos since you need to have your hands on your rope at all times so sadly I did not get any photos of my husband in his harness. I suggest you take all photos before you start you climbing.

The husband and I went to Pita Jungle last night at approximately 6:30. I was very hungry, perhaps on the verge of hangry (a dramatic form of hunger) and so we promptly ordered an appetizer ( large hummus trio, to be specific). In my amazement, the large platter was set before me only seconds after I ordered. It was like magic. It was brilliant. It was faster than any fast food service I have ever received. The platter was visually appealing with a green hummus (cilantro), a red hummus (red pepper) and yellow (normal hummus).  I also ordered steam vegetables - partly to be healthy, and also partly for additional dipping options. I've never been to a place the supplied a good pita bread to hummus ratio - you always need an extra pita.  But, the carrots especially made a good hummus-to-mouth shoveling vehicle.   That is the only problem I have with Pita Jungle though, I always have to order an appetizer in order to get full. And, it's not that the serving sizes are too small because the serving plates are large and completely utilized. So, I don't know, it's like how my kitchen spoons always go missing - I don't have an explanation. It's not like they ever leave the house.  Giving 5 stars for such a good service.  I've been eating at Pita Jungle for years and the food is always good, although I would probably give 4 stars if just on taste alone. But service in seconds? It's hard to beat that.  Friendly staff, outdoor seating, and wine help seal the deal.

We used Angel's for both my mother-in-law and father-in-law and found the staff to be nothing short of compassionate.  I recently took my mother-in-law's ashes back to them so that they could be divided (with an urn I purchased elsewhere).  They divided the ashes immediately, for $10, which I am not even sure I actually paid.   On my way out, I mentioned we would be going on an airplane and they insisted on re-doing their work (separating the ashes from the urn, making it easier to  get through security) and provided me a lot of useful information.  They could have easily just allowed me to leave, but they were cared about making the traveling experience as easy and hassle free as possible.    The environment is peaceful and the staff was calming.   It is not a fancy place, but it is small and quaint and it was nice to not a financial burden on top of losing both of my huband's parent within the same year.  We received hand-signed cards for the past two years since their deaths.

Do you ever feel like you don't see enough Pez dispensers these days?  I feel a little conflicted when it come to these old school candy gems - on one hand, I love the candy.  It is the sweetness of a smartie with the crunch of a sweet tart and the rainbow coloring skittles.  On the other hand, it is a HEAD ON A STICK and the candy comes out of the NECK.  It is a scene straight out of a horror movie.    And who can eat from a Pez dispenser and not think of Lord of the Flies at least once?  Well, there is one demographic - young kids.  This is the same group of people that you probably don't want to take with you when you a buy a car, since it is a long and tedious process.  I cannot think of many things less entertaining than buying a car. Maybe watching someone clean grout?  For those who bring their kids with them anyway (like me!!) Camelback Toyota has you covered.  There is a whole area designated for kids. There is a video game console, a television, a cave, books, and little toys.  I really appreciate Camelback Toyota making a point to be family friendly. Prior to our visit there, we quickly visited a shop directly across the street and they did not even have a token candy bowl filled with dum dums.    Having the kids mildly entertained and drowning in Pez, allowed my husband and I to not only test drive two cars, but complete an actual purchase.  And, to make it even sweeter, the deal we got was great and the customer service was also fantastic. We never felt pressured or taken advantage of.   We walked out with a beautiful used Prius and I could not be happier.  Also, they did not require us to even bring our trade in, we were able to trade it in sight unseen.  That level of convenience is just as helpful as the Pez dispensers.  Our sales person was Amir, and was nothing short of pleasant and helpful.  I know it sounds crazy, but I actually think he was also sincere. I would buy a car from him again.  The air conditioner was on full blast so my last piece of advice is to bring a sweater.

Considering that a surgical center is never going to be a fun experience, Piper surgery center did manage to make it as pleasant as possible.  I was first pleased with the minimal time spent in the waiting room.  Usually, when I see a doctor of any kind, I spend more time in the waiting area than the exam room. But they literally had me checked in only 5 minutes after my arrival.  They have a security guard that personally takes your valuables (rings, keys, credit cards, etc) and locks them up for safe keeping and piece of mind (because of course they are not responsible).  Their gowns are typical hospital gowns at first sight. However, they actually have a ventilation system that blows air into them.  You are given a remote to control the temperature of this air.  Unfortunately, I was unknowingly laying on this remote and thus unaware of its existence...the air blowing into my gown was very warm. At first, this pleased me because I  typically run cold and it was nice to feel warmth.  But, after 10 minutes, it became extremely hot and sweaty under my gown, and I started to feel concerned about potentially emitting unappealing body odors.  But the nurses are so friendly that I was not embarrassed for more than one second after they laughed and showed me how to adjust my air flow.  The air can become quite cold, very fast, so be careful.  The best part though was the end.  At Piper, they are very eager to get rid of you.  I awoke in a little bit of pain, and a lot of fog, to have my previously locked up valuables placed on my chest and a nurse handing me my underwear.  There is very little time for moaning or groaning - they call your ride (if they are not in the waiting room) and before you can even tell what is really going on, you are seated in the car and on your way home.  Or, in my case, to the Chik Filet drive cone for a vanilla soft serve ice cream cone.   There is also a very cute man nurse. Not sure if this is a positive or negative thing when you are overheating a backless gown though!

So I understand that medical bills are always high...but my jaw was on the floor when I received my itemized bill!   For example, remember the "best part" of my experience, mentioned in my review as the recovery room where they were very "eager" to "get rid" of me?  I was literally brought outside, placed in my husband's car, and driven off before I completely even woke up?  Those 10 minute in the recovery room cost over $2,500!  That is...$4.10 per second.   PER SECOND.  Yeah yeah, insurance, yeah...that covers 20%.  At the hospital, they quoted me $600.  And then they ended up billing me $800.  The whole thing is whack!    Next time, I will just ask to be put to be placed curbside instead.

I really enjoy birthday cakes and I have to say that Fry's can make a good cake. In fact, when put in front of me next to a similar cake from AJ's, I cannot tell a difference (since I am not a spring chicken anymore, I have had many cakes from both places, although I do love AJ's).    My mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.  If you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?     Needless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive.

My trip to Eyeglass World symbolized yet another stage in my life - my first pair of glasses.  If I was in my 20's, I probably would have been bitter and requesting contacts. But, since I am not, I was excited to finally join the masses and get my first pair of glasses.  Specifically, reading glasses for work.    Eyeglass World had a lot of eye glasses.  It also had a lot of mirrors.  I had a blast trying on and critiquing frames.  After a  bit, I had six considerations, so I brought them up to the front desk to get some professional opinions.  And this where I will say, THANK GOODNESS FOR MARY.  If you go to Eyeglass Word, make sure  you talk to Mary.  She has been working in the eyeglass field for her entire life and she looked at my pile of glasses in horror.  She picked up the first pair and said, "You are so pretty, why do you want granny glasses?"  I jumped back. "No!  I don't want granny glasses!!"  She picked up the next pair. "These are also something you would see on an old lady."  She picked up the next pair. "Slightly better," she said. "This is something you would see on an old lady trying to look cool."  And while the truth can be harsh, the fact is, I have horrible taste in glasses and should never be allowed to purchase eye glasses without supervision.  If Mary did not care, I would have walked out with the same pair my 82 year old grandma wears as she falls asleep on the couch while watching reruns of Lawrence Welk.  Mary bravely took control and directed me to the frames that I had completely ignored - the kid frames.  These frames fit my narrow face better, come in the fun colors that I wanted, and were half the price.  Mary opened up a cabinet below and started taking out even more glasses. She held them up one by one, and handed them to me if they won her approval. With her help, I purchased a great pair of purple ray-bans that were covered by insurance and guaranteed to be nothing my grandma would wear.  The rest of my experience was easy and fast.   I also got my glasses the same day. They were molded to fit my face.  They are everything I every wanted in a pair of glasses.  And the text I am typing is remarkably sharp right now. Needless to say, I would return to Eyeglass World.

This is where we always go for Mother's Day since menu, which is more like a book, can accommodate both  the youngest picky eater, and the elderly picky eater.  Even though the menu can be intimidating, it would be very far fetched to say that someone could like NOTHING on the menu.  You can get anything from plain pancakes, to extravagant omelets, to a simple hotdog, to a plethora of smoked fish, to a healthy salad, to a massive burger covered in ranch dressing.  And I am not even kidding - you can have a traditional thanksgiving meal of turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce and potato, covered in cheese, and stuffed into a slider - any day of the week.  I enjoy  the fact that they serve breakfast all day, coupled with the fact that there is a full bar, and ordering wine or beer or gin and tonic with  your pancakes is perfectly reasonable.  The service has never been bad, but it has been slow. However, Chompies provides all-you-can-eat dill pickles that are everything you would expect from pickles at a jewish deli.    If the menu is intimidating, stick to the stuff that Chompies is known for - massive sandwiches, sliders on challah bread, and bagels.  In fact, next to the door there is a clearance rack of day old bagels, which last a long time, especially in  the freezer.  There are 12 bagels per bag, for $2.50.  At Costco, a dozen of bagels costs $5 and at the grocery store, a half a dozen bagels cost $5, so this is a great deal if you embrace carbs like us.

This location was better a year ago before they turned it around to make it like all the other ones. I remember back in the day, Happy Hour was all weekend and all well drinks were $2!!  They didn't have all the perks, like the appetizers or "large" bowl option, or even the little ordering cards.  I keep going back though, and the food is still tasting good, so I am acclimating. I really like the build-it-yourself philosophy.  Perhaps I am a control freak, but I like to decide how much spice and sauce and broccoli goes into my bowl. I like a lot of broccoli, moderate amount of sauce, and a little spice.  My husband goes the complete opposite route with no broccoli, tons of sauce, and too much spice. It just would not be a complete experience at Genghis Grill if it does not include him pondering that maybe his bowl is too spicy.  Getting back to those appetizers, I suggest skipping them. If you shove down all the contents of your bowl as you  go through the line, a regular bowl is enough food.  We got the edamame last time because it was included in a coupon, and it was mediocre. We also got the ice cream since it was also included in the coupon, and it was also mediocre.  Envision two very small scoops of vanilla ice cream in a small dish, lightly drizzled with chocolate sauce.  That is the sundae. No whip cream, no sprinkles and no cherry on top.   The servers are always friendly and the people watching is usually acceptably entertaining.  Sign up for their mailing list because you get good coupons (although then you wind up with boring edamame and cherry-less sundaes....). Kids eat free on Tuesdays!

I love this restaurant and go here frequently, but I can't give it 5 stars only because too many times service has been painfully slow.  We are usually okay with the slow service because it gives me time to enjoy my two favorite things. But, sometimes it will test my patience.  On to my favorites: First, the appetizer, which in my case is always the Crudites.  It is basically a massive bowl of raw vegetables served over ice.  It does not sound exciting but it is the most gorgeous bowl of raw vegetables that you will ever see!  The veggies are seasonal, so they vary, and often they will include something unrecognizable, yet vibrantly purple, and it's just not often enough in life that I get to think, "Hmm, what is this purple thing I am putting in my mouth?"  My second favorite thing is some fabulous drink called the Skinny Cucumber Citrus Margarita. Since it is "skinny" and since there is plenty of time before the food arrives, you can drink two of these drinks. Or three, if you are a little crazy and not driving.  It is muddled cucumber, oranges and mint (heck, this makes it almost healthy!) and topped with a little carbonation.  It is just so good, I wish I was drinking one right now. My husband always gets a beer, feels a little disappointed when it comes out of a can, but then likes it and orders a second, too.  The food is good  and the menu is seasonal.  The kids' pizza is HUGE but all the adult servings are normal.  The kale salad that comes with the burgers is best if it is taken in the same bite as the sweet potato hash (that also comes on the side). The sweetness helps cut the bitterness.  The waiters are cute and I recommend sitting outside!

This place has tasty food - hence the 4 stars. Is it mind blowing? No.  But for fast food, it is a four star option.  However, when I compare it to other greek-style places, it falls short in a few ways:  1) The condiments.  For starters, you do not get any.  Between myself and my husband, we could probably go through a gallon of tzatiki sauce in one meal.  He likes to drench his fries in it, I like to dress my salad with it...but all you get (per gyro) is one itty bitty sad little cup.  And if you want feta cheese?  Jalapenos? Olives? A side of ANYTHING?  You must pay.  It makes one feel a bit nickeled and dimed (although the condiments cost much more than a single nickel or dime or nickel and dime combined).  It even cost $.50 to add cucumber to your gyro.  That can buy an entire cucumber at the grocery store!  2) The french fries.  They are not bad fries per say, but they are bland.  They need some salt, or some garlic seasoning, or something.  I will add - they are not soggy and that is something I appreciate.  I hate soggy fries!!!  The other downside is that they are a small serving.  As a female, I often try to avoid greasy food to help counterbalance my ice cream intake, and instead I like to eat them off my husband's plate. Because if they come from my husband's plate, then they do not count as part of my meal. Right?  But this is hard to do when my husband is protecting a small reserve.  At the end of the day,when you add up all the condiments, a meal costs over $20.  And as I type this, my husband is in the kitchen eating chips out of the pantry, so the $20 did not even fill him up.  But was it tasty, yes. We just needed more french fries and condiments.

My husband was surprised that I wanted to go here for dinner because I don't typically eat at bars (although I do enjoy drinking at them).  But my interest was piqued by their self-reference as "family friendly."  I don't associate a tavern as a family destination, but those with the most kids sometimes need to drink the most.    We played it safe though and left our rugrats with grandpa.  Arcadia Tavern was true to their word - in addition to a kids menu, kids eat free on Mondays. And, in the back, there is a whole area designated to kids...with a television, video game console, activity table and play kitchen.  There were a lot of young kids there, all were well behaved, and happily eating and/or smearing ketchup on their face. That makes this place 1% mall play area.  My water glass came adorned with a cucumber.  I love having cucumbers in my water. That makes this place 1% spa.  The menu provides everything you would expect from a tavern...wings, burgers, french fries, sliders... but there were also some non-expected items, like numerous fresh salads.  They even had a grilled vegetable salad - that makes this place 1% farmers market.  I ordered the steak salad, which came on a huge bed of spinach, big chunks of well-seasoned steak, and marinated mushrooms.  My husband took the more manly approach and ordered some burger, covered in bacon,  covered in cheese. They also had thin-crust pizzas, bruschetta, and sliced ahi tuna.  At the end of the day though, it's still 97% a bar...but its pretty good bar food.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a $5 off coupon. However, you cannot use this coupon in conjunction with a Groupon, or the Kids Eat Free Monday.  I don't care for that policy, but if you don't have a Groupon or kids, then it works.

We only stopped by Clancy's to kill an hour and have a drink (or two).  The patio looked inviting, filled with people enjoy themselves. And, once it got dark, it was illuminated by christmas lights. I am a sucker for decorative lighting (hence the purple christmas lighting that I leave up year-round).    Since we were only doing drinks though, we opted for the bar. I was satisfied with their well-stocked varieties of fruity flavored liquors.  I am a girl. I will admit it: I like  girly drinks.  I was immediately drawn to their "cereal shooter" menu, which included seven or eight shooters that mimicked cereal flavors.  I got the "Trix" flavor, which was Rumchata, raspberry vodka, orange vodka and blue curacao.  Although there are quite a few ingredients, the drink lives up to its name - it is a shooter - there is not much to savor.  However, it also really does taste like it promises, so I do recommend these if you like leftover sugary cereal milk.  The place is pretty small yet there were a lot of televisions.  This is a great thing if you love watching sports! I am not much of a sports person, so more reasoning why next time I will sit outside.  Towards the end of our hour, we were approached  by an angry man wearing sunglasses and talking loudly and rudely. We were oblivious that he was talking loudly and rudely to *us*.  It had something to do with his contempt for New York and itchiness. However, I don't mind a little drama when I am out and about, and the staff handled it really well. If anything, it was a bonding moment for us and the follow patrons at the bar.  Normal people unite!!  I would  go back to Clancy's (to order food and sit outside).  It had a good vibe, good staff and were not stingy with their Maraschino cherries at the bar.

Clean Freak does everything it promises: it cleans your car in three minutes.  The price point is a little high ($5) considering a mile away there is a $3 car wash, but if you ask, they provide blue rags for dusting off the interior.    Further, a friendly employee will take your payment, unlike the automated kiosk at the cheaper place, which requires you to drive up super close, unbuckle your seat belt, and stretch your torso out the window, while grunting, in order to insert your credit card.  In general, car washes seem to have either a large brush that rolls up the windshield, or a big hanging wipe that sloshes back and forth.  Clean Freak has the former and it just doesn't quite have enough force to get off the most stubborn bird poop.  You can scrape it off before rolling in, with a provided squeegee, but that slightly defeats the purpose of the automated car wash.

When my kids were younger, I literally took to my gym - and stuck them in the daycare.  It was great - I was free woman!  But there were two problems: 1) I was stuck at the gym. 2) I had this annoying, bulky pager that I had to carry with me so that I could be alerted if I had to return to the child center. If my kids had to pee, blow their nose, fall and get a bruise...I was alerted.  At My Gym, you can drop off and go to your gym - or go anywhere - and they take care of all potty breaks, buggers and bruises.  Not only are you paying for gym class, you are paying for freedom.   Classes are only one of offerings provided by MyGym. You can also drop off during free play, and at camp sessions during spring/winter/summer break.  AND, every other Friday, you can drop off for parents night out (or what I tell the kids, "kid night!!"), where you drop them off for pizza at 5:30, and then pick them up, all tired and worn out, right before bed.  I guess the most important thing to note is that the kids really enjoy the gym. They have swings that extend from the ceiling, a trampoline, ball pit, and a ZIP LINE.  I wish they had those things at my fitness gym.

I live next door the Hole in the Rock and as a trail runner, I find myself running up it frequently.  I want to clarify that I give this 5 stars as a family recreational site - not as a hiking or running trail.  This is a great .25 mile hike for a family. I started taking my kids there when they were 3 years old.  My son is as clumsy as they come and even he can manage the trail.  Most of the trail is stairs although there is some loose rock.  Today, I watched a two year old climb the whole thing on her own.  The view is pretty amazing for such a short little trail. Sometimes in the morning I run up and down and I never actually stop to take a breath and look.  But when I do, I always think to myself, 'Wow, I need to stop and taking a breath more often'.

This is good tasting yogurt, no doubt, but it also is pretty minimal compared to its rivals.  I guess you could make the quality over quantity argument,  but I like having a lot of options.  In addition to yogurt, they also sell baked goods (cupcakes, carrot cakes, brownies).  While the baked goods looked divine, I would have preferred an expanded toppings bar.    Homemade cupcake on the side of my ice cream?  Nah. Homemade cupcake INSIDE my ice cream?  Now that is the kind of thing that you dream about and wake up next to a pile of drool.  My first time experiencing self-serve froyo was many years ago, in San Diego, while pregnant. I remember practically lifting my jaw off the ground because I could not believe the wonderfulness of so many flavors and so many toppings all just at the tip of my fingers.  And all though the yogurt was very tasty, I didn't get that thrill from just six flavors (including chocolate, plain and strawberry).  The cakebatter sounds delightful, but they didn't have that today - graham cracker was as exciting as it came.  Same with the toppings - there were not even any sprinkles!  And, don't get me wrong, I love crushed chocolate bars and fresh strawberries as much as the next person, but I did miss having an array of colors and an almost overwhelming topping selection.  I do need to tip my hat though to the "boba balls," which were basically little balls of fruit that burst in your mouth as you ate them.    As covered by everyone else, the store was thoughtfully clean. Fresh water was also offered.  And, if you are like me and get a huge ice cream to share with two little kids, the three different colored spoons (pink, blue and  yellow) available at the register are a fun little perk.  You are probably not like me though --- however, a pink spoon is always worth a mention.

Let me begin with just saying that it shames that 1) I am reviewing Walmart and 2) giving it four stars and 3) considered giving it five stars.  I live in South Scottsdale by the dirtiest, busiest, loudest Walmart in town.  Every single cart is broken and you would be able to hear every cart across the store if YOUR own cart wasn't making such a ruckus.  Needless to say, I shop at Target instead.    But this Walmart on Cactus is like a Walmart from another planet.  It is so quiet.  My cart today did not make a sound.  It is also clean, and the staff was friendly.  Even odder, they seemed happy!  Maybe it was an illusion, but it made shopping much more pleasurable when people said hi to me, instead of grunting to me. I felt like I was shopping at a Target with Walmart prices.  The store was a bit confusing to navigate, they do a great job making you walk through the entire store to do a complete shopping trip.  But I didn't mind...otherwise I would have missed out on gems like BIRTHDAY CAKE ICING STUFFED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.  I couldn't even make such a thing up if I tried!  They also carried by beloved Blue Bunny fudgecicles that Frys stopped carrying years ago.  I am not saying that I want to start to doing my weekly shopping at Walmart, (or wait, what if I am saying that and this is the start of an identity crisis?!)  I know others gave this a poor review, and maybe compared to the Northsight location it is a dump...but compared to 32nd street and Thomas, it is a palace on a cloud.  NEVER GO TO THE 32nd STREET AND THOMAS location unless you hate yourself or need to contract a disease.

I mostly get gas at Costco, but when I have Fry's Fuel Points, this is the gas station  that I hit up. For the most part, it is convenient because I live by it, but even when it's not convenient (like, when I am out shopping or working across town), I still make it a point to get to this gas station to fill up, even if it means running down to the last drop of gas.  The reason being is because it is at least a dime cheaper than other Circle Ks.  Sometimes, it is the same price as Costco!  So, if you have 200 or 300 fuel points,  you can get gas $.20 or $.30 cheaper than Costco.    My husband says it's not worth the effort that I put in to save just a few dollars on gas.  And, maybe he is right.  But it is so expensive these days, like everything else, and it just makes me feel good when I see the price get down to like $2.97.  It reminds of the good old days, like back in 2005.  The problem is though lack of parking.  So, the gas station (which is small), always appears to be packed.  But if you look closely, most cars are empty.  These people really need to read my Yelp review about QT.  There is nothing special about soda or coffee from  this particular location.  It is all about the cheap gas.

My husband has to go to the dry cleaner on a regular basis...at least twice a week (once to drop off, and once to pick up and drop off more).  I was surprised when he left his regular cleaner but he said this place was more conveniently located.  I went with him a few times, service was good, and his clothes always smelled clean enough to me.  However, one downside is they have a $10 minimum for running credit cards. My husband and I prefer to not carry cash, so this is inconvenient.  My husband recently dropped off $9 worth of clothing and did not have enough cash on hand when he went to pick up.  Instead of overlooking a few measly dimes, they would not run his card. My husband even offered to pre-pay for a future order (since you know, he goes 2x/week), and they said no.  So the poor man had to walk to the grocery store to use an ATM, which is not cheap these days, but it was either that or leave without any clothing and have nothing to wear to work.  There was no physical reason they could not  have swiped the card.  It would have been a nice thing to do in order to keep a customer that has very little clothing and relies on weekly dry cleaning.  But, since they would not run the card because his order was .70 cents too cheap, my husband will not be returning.  But yeah, the clothing comes back clean...so two stars for that. But note that they do not clean coats or do alterations.

My niece requested Chompie's while in town visiting from the east coast. It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available.   But, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!  She did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.  We usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons: 1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.   2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.  As always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.  And, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away.

My relationship with Sole Sports began when I trained for my first marathon. I actually had to double check that date like 10 times because I cannot believe it was 2004.  I guess time goes by really fast when you are having fun running. And that is why I am giving them a five-star review. Not only have they provided me the latest and greatest shoes to keep me running, they have provided an amazing community that has made running so much more than I ever thought possible.  As mentioned by others, the group runs are incredibly welcoming and supportive - and seem to attract the friendliest, jolliest people. It probably partly has to do with the friendly, jolly staff...and then partly because runners are just plain awesome.  Just like a good running store should, they will do a gait analysis (treadmill, video, and slow-motion playback) to ensure that your shoe purchase is the best purchase possible. The staff is very knowledgeable (and they are all runners themselves) so you can trust them.  This is a big deal, especially for newer runners, because the wrong shoe can result in injuries.  They also have really cute clothing that I just try not to look at (which is hard, I admit).  Lastly, Sole Sports supports the local running community to help make the smaller, local (and cheaper!) races possible.  These races are always so much fun and to me, just as important as my running shoes. Although don't get me wrong, I am also thankful for my shoes ;)

I have not had my windshield replaced but I have gotten calls from this company literally EVERY day.   They called me (I never reached out to them) and asked if I had any dents on my windshield. I was getting into my car and had just noticed a small one so I answered, "actually yes, a small one...."  They automatically started asking when they could come and fix it.  I told them I was not interested right now and hung up.  So they called back again and again - and each time I told them I was not interested in fixing it.  They always argued, "but your insurance company will pay!!!"   When I finally got aggressive with them, after about seven phone calls, they in return, got aggressive with me.  Harassment is NOT an acceptable sales tactic.

I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The ONLY downside is that it's an addictive little treat.  Every day is such a "hard" day, and my back "always hurts" topped off with "well, it's only $35, my husband won't care."  I mean, others treat themselves every morning to a $5 caffeine riddled cup of coffee adorned with whip cream - is that really any different to treating oneself to a massage every week?  Or every couple of days?  Exactly.  People need massages like coffee.  There are a few things that make this place so easily accessible, unlike other  massage parlors.    1) No appointment necessary.  You can literally decided you need a massage and 10 minutes later be getting one. 2) It is next to Sprouts.  It's not my fault I have to go to the grocery store. 3) It is open late (until 10pm) and on weekends.   4) It is cheap.  $35 (plus tip) for one hour.  $45 if you really want to go crazy and get the hot stones. 5) You can even get a massage while doing yoga.  In this case, massage = exercise.  I really cannot think of anything bad to say about this place.  They soak your feet in warm water, and while it is called a "foot massage", they also massage your neck and arms and your hands and head.  And, then it gets better -- they flip you over and massage your back.  Everyone is good but I recommend Tony.  To know my knowledge there is at least three men named Tony...but do not fret, there is no need to specify, every Tony is amazing.

My review is probably two years late since it has been over two years since Dr.Price cured my acne.  Unfortunately, I have always struggled with my skin but it didn't get really bad until  I had kids.  All of a sudden - BAM - right when I should have started focusing on preventing wrinkles, I had to deal with cystic acne that rivaled that of a 16-year old boy (no offense teenage boys).  I did proactive, chemical peels, prescription topical creams, prescription pills. I stopped eating chocolate, which is the  most drastic of drastic things you can possibly do.  Dr. Price was my last resort but she was AMAZING. My face cleared up quickly and although it did require some TLC, I finally had clear skin (for the first time in my life) and could focus on more age-appropriate things, like botox.  But I digress..,  Dr. Price put me on two creams and a unique pill (prescribed off-label). Over time, I decreased my dosage and finally stopped taking it.  The other day, I notice I had two zits.  I had a minor freak out in my head and left a message at Linder.  Like most of the voicemails I leave, I rambled,  over-communicated, and almost forgot to leave my name.  In my defense, I always text people so I am out-of-practice when it comes to talking to a machine.  After I hung up, I kicked myself for leaving such an awkward and long message.  I was pretty sure I would have to  make an appointment, take time off work, and see myself back into the waiting room to properly explain my situation and get a script.  But nope - 24 hours later, my script was miraculously filled and waiting for pick up at Walgreens!  When it comes to doctors and prescriptions, it is never that easy.  And this is not the first time within the past 2+ years that I have had such wonderful customer service (this is just the first time I remembered to write a review). Once, I called to refill my prescription, and asked for the wrong amount.  When I called to correct it, they dealt with my insurance company so that they covered an additional  script.  These small  things do not go unnoticed with me because usually these same small things wind up being largely annoying things elsewhere.  The staff is super friendly and no surprise, they all have great skin too.

Costco is awesome, almost so reputedly awesome that it never occurred to me review it....because, duh, it has free samples, $1.50 jumbo hotdogs that come with a soda, cheap gas, great hummus, jumbo size bottles of vodka, pizza slices too big to fit on the plate, tubs of jelly beans and satisfying Lululemon knockoffs.   But this location, my home location, is just so friendly and welcoming.  When my twins were babies, I used to wear one on my chest and one on my bike as I marched through the store devouring the samples.  And, now 5 years later, it is the EXACT SAME adorable ladies passing out the samples.  Every week they tell me, "Wow, look how big they are!"  (yes, we go every week).  And yes, they are big because they have been eating Costco samples their entire life!  At the end of our excursion today, I carelessly attempted to move the strawberries from my cart onto the conveyor belt using only one hand -- i should have known better, NOTHING in Costco is meant to be picked up with one hand -- and such, it resulted in many strawberries on the floor.  I felt foolish.... until I met Tim.  Tim, as it read on his name badge, came to rescue me, scooping up the strawberries and reassuring me that, "it happens all the time."     Hmmm, really Tim? Sensing my doubt, he added, "it even even happened to me the other day."  And then he scurried back to bring me a new thing of strawberries.  Thank you, Tim.  Although I still doubt that it happened to you. And thank you Costco, for being a staple in my life and baking the best sheet cake in the world.  One day, I will buy that Vitamix!

I do a lot of yoga and this is so far the best place I have found, and the fact that it is also the cheapest is just icing on the cake.  The studio is hot, but not nearly as hot as others...I don't get dizzy as often and if you stay to the left side of the room, it is even more manageable. I don't think more heat = more benefits, it just results in more dehydration.    I love the flow class and I like how there is a little bit of core work at the end.  There is a really nice mixture of people - sure, lots of the young people you would expect given the area, but also less young people, like myself, and a nice blend of genders.   The instructors are all so friendly and the owner is fabulous.  I highly recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for a welcoming and non-intimidating place to do yoga.

I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed because I don't know how to start my review....do I just profess my love in general? Admit that I am addicted to the energy drink, Rooster Booster, that they keep on tap?    The thing that really separates QT from other gas stations is their delightful array of slushi drinks. They have more flavors than Circle K and Seven Eleven combined. I like to use a slushi drink in replace of ice...so, white cherry slushi + coke = cherry coke.  You can get crazy with it, add watermelon to Sprite, and pina colada to Rooster Booster.  You can try doing this at Seven Eleven, with their sub-par slushies, but I can guarantee you that the dude behind the register will stare you down until you break into a cold sweat, and three video cameras will zoom in on your every move.  If you want slushy at Seven Eleven, you must pay for slushi!  But not at Quick Trip...they invite you to mix their slushies with your soda.  Their commercials even encourage it.  THANK YOU QUICK TRIP, for challenging my creativity and ingenuity.  So now that I provided that crucial background information, it is time to reveal what makes this particular QT so particularly amazing.  Are you ready?  THEY HAVE 22 FLAVORS OF SLUSHI.  There are three different blue flavors, eight red/pink flavors and multiple neon flavors. They even have a sugar-free flavor, so if your digestive track can handle sugar-free stuff, you can drink these every day and call it a diet.  WINNING!  And if your slushi-soda combination creates a reaction and your cup overflows, do not fear...according to the QT worker today, "it happens all the time."  And that is probably why he appeared out of thin air before I even realized that my cup was combusting.  He came with paper towels, a smile, and a floor cleaning machine. You just have to love a place that never has sticky floors.

Somehow in the midst of my excitement over the abnormally high number of slushy flavors, every time I go to this QT gas station, I somehow overlooked the thing in the middle.  IT IS A WHIPPED TOPPING MACHINE.  Who would ever expect a whipped topping machine in the middle of a wall of slushies? I almost thought I was dreaming.   On the machine it says, "Add whipped topping to your favorite frozen or hot drink."    I assume that since the machine is smack dab in the middle of the wall of slush, that "favorite frozen drink" refers to slushy.  I never thought that I would see the day that putting whipped topping on a slushy would not only be deemed appropriate, but even be encouraged. This QT gas station is clearly one (or 100) steps ahead of the game and I hope that all other QTs (and circle Ks and 7Elevens) follow their lead.   So, the curious reader is probably wondering, "how does whipped topping on a slushy taste?"   Let me just say: why eat a popsicle when you can eat a creamsicle? I  now realize that a slushy without whipped topping is like a cake without icing or a raisin without chocolate.    The machine is a little loud, do not let this scare you.  It also is a little slow, so you must be patient as you wait for your whipped topping to drop.  Aside from the screen that says "Push Here for Whipped Topping," there are no instructions, but do practice caution when mixing the whipped topping on soda.  Yes, you can put it in soda...it's not as weird as it sounds, think of rootbeer floats, or the more obvious, cream soda.  Unfortunately, the whipped topping seems to trigger a volcanic effect when added to soda so make sure you leave a good 2-3 inches in your cup to prepare yourself.  Even if you quickly put a lid on it, the increased carbonation will fizz right through the straw hole.  My husband foolishly waited in the car for me while I ran in to buy (aka "create") his fountain drink and unbeknownst to him, I added whipped topping, which continued to fizz through the straw hole for quite some time.   If this does happen to you, just try to not make any sharp turns while you drive.  It will be messy.

I found myself here because I purchased a Groupon...oddly enough, it is right next to the grocery store I frequent every week, and yet I never noticed it. Sometimes I go to  the grocery store to buy sushi rolls, oblivious that I am walking past a sushi restaurant.  That is  because from the outside, it looks like nothing.  At least nothing safe. The windows are completely black.  I had some buyers remorse once I saw the outside.  But, as the saying goes, "you can't judge a book by it's cover" because the inside provided the atmosphere I was expecting, down to the fish tank.  I loved the menu.  If you love raw fish, you too will love this menu.  Our dinner was pretty cliche, with miso soup, caterpillar roll, spicy tuna roll, and saki bombers.  At the end, we ordered mochi ice cream, which was totally foreign to me. I am still confused about this item...it is basically ice cream that is covered in chewy candy, like a soft gummy bear (or an Airhead is a better description, if you are familiar with candy).   It reminds me of the time I put chocolate ice cream on my baked potato.  The ice cream absorbed into the potato, leaving me a chocolate potato (and hey, don't judge, if you ever dipped a french fry into a Wendy's Frostie, you know what I am talking about). Anyway, my point -- some things are just texturally an odd pairing, even when they  taste good.  But, the whole thing was covered in whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce.....so, whatever, I'd eat it again.

I am not a fan of fast food - not to be pretentious because we all have our vices. I happen to prefer to indulge in sweets, like cake and candy and sometimes ice cream. My kids and I often go to McDonald's (or as they call it, "the ice cream store") to eat vanilla cones. And then I sit on my phone and read E!News while they crawl through the tunnels.  They wanted to go to a "new ice cream store" today so we went an extra mile to Chick-Fil-A.  I ordered our typical cones and then my 4-year old son blurted out that he wanted chocolate.  Well, of course the only soft serve option is vanilla. I had a brief flashback of  the good old days when McDonald's offered chocolate soft serve....and even better, my personal favorite, swirl.  So, I asked if they had any chocolate syrup because we would take some and she said no, they could not do that.  But then a man from behind her said, "yes, we can. we can blend some up."  And that is exactly what he did!  Our first 2 vanilla cones (that we ordered and paid for) were delivered to us promptly.  And  then a few minutes later, a huge cup of chocolate ice cream was delivered to us as well.  And it had a large cone sticking out of it.  I felt like I needed to pay for it, but he said absolutely not.  And whatever this chocolate concoction was, it was really really good.  Like a Frostie, and maybe even better.  I am not sure of the last time I got such good customer service, although I am sure that it was not a fast food established.   So 5 stars to  them for delivering something that was not on the menu (and for no cost!) to make a kid happy.  And the very clean play area, free from the stench of urine, was just the icing on the cake.

If we were going off my personal opinion on the taste of food alone, I would probably only designate four stars.  BUT, this is the only place where the kid meal comes with broccoli (or roasted veggies, kale/apple slaw, you get to decide...).  If I cook broccoli sprinkled with Parmesan at home, my kids will push it around on their plate.  But at Flower Child, I caught them fighting over the last piece of broccoli.  So Bravo, Flower Child. Nicely done.  I took my husband here as well and he got the Flying Avocado, which is a burrito with avocado. But it's not like a mammoth man-size Chipotle burrito, it is a normal burrito, representing a generous yet practical and digestible serving size.  I appreciate the lack of fried food and a fresh option outside of the AJ's salad bar. Because lets face it, AJ's is cool but their salad bar is no Whole Foods, except in price.  The only thing I do not like about the chicken-nugget-less kid meals are the enormous drinking cups that they come with.  The options for filling these cups (outside of water) are a variety of teas (caffeine!) and lemonades (sugar!)  Everything in moderation so I recommend watering down the lemonade for kids, and maybe even adults, if you do not like things coyingly sweet.  What I wanted to touch on (because I doubt anyone else will take it there) is the bathroom mirrors.  I am not saying they are bad, or saying they are good, I am just saying that it is always an interesting sight to be facing a full length mirror while you use the restroom.  My daughter was especially intrigued by this and very determined to watch herself go in as many ways as possible.    So far I have tried the steak, pho, and a variety of side dishes - everything is tasty and if my man-size-burrito loving husband enjoyed it, I would say there is something there for any type of eater.  Except for those who only eat french fries.

Please note that I am reviewing on piercing/customer service alone, I have not been inked by  this business.    5 years ago, I had to take my bellybutton piercing out during a pregnancy.  I never had intention to get re-pierced except for a few weeks ago, when I noticed that it was still open.  I was pretty excited to stick something through it, so I went to the mall and picked out some dangly, sparkly,  earring that was 10 years too young for me.  Luckily, I could not get it all the way inserted, and within hours, it was missing.  Then the other day I noticed Body Canvas Tattoo after getting something notarized at the adjacent UPS store.  In a flash decision, I walked over, with the my two five year olds in tow, to get an age-appropriate earring placed into my belly.  The door had a sign that strictly prohibited children, no exception, but I didn't even process the sign until I already had the door open and both my wide-eyed kids were staring inside.  However the presumable owner, or manager, was very nice and allowed them to come and sit on the comfortable couch that is in the front area.   I was relieved to see a functional business with people who spoke English because the previous "company" that inhibited this location was sketchy at best.  I want to clarify that this location is now a new business, that has a light, a legitimate register, and friendly employees.  The reason I was unable to insert the earring myself turned out to be because the hole was closed on the inside. But the piercer at Body Canvas quickly re-pierced it - the equipment was sterile, his piercing was accurate, nearly painless, and it quickly healed.  He was experienced and skilled, plus he had a mohawk, which brought me fond feelings of crowd surfing at Rancid concerts during the late 90s.  I will gladly return to Body Canvas for my next impromptu  piercing.

I was captivated when I saw a Groupon for a Walking Farms Pony Gram. Actually, you had a choice between the Pony Gram and Donkey Gram (the latter being perhaps the most genius way to break up with a person...kind of like a text message on crack.)  The premise is exactly as it sounds: A pony (or donkey) is delivered (with a handler) at your choice of location. They come decorated as appropriate, and deliver a message.  This is ideal for any child because who would not be thrilled to see a beautifully decorated PONY show up at their doorstep? And yes, a pony ride is included.   But, if you think outside the box, this is also ideal for anyone who is hard to shop for, because like I said, who would not be thrilled to see a pony at their door, with streamers carefully braided in their mane and adorned with a birthday hat?  I immediately knew that this was the perfect gift for my mother's 60th birthday. She is incredibly hard to shop for but enjoys public displays of craziness that would embarrass anyone else, including myself.  However, I sucked it up for her big day and had the pony delivered to her favorite restaurant as we sat outside on the patio.  The surprise was slightly foiled when she saw the huge horse carrier drive past in the parking lot...but that was no fault of the farm, I should have had my mother facing the opposite way!  She loved the spectacle and I loved the super friendly and gorgeous horse. The handler was equally friendly, very punctual, and let multiple people ride the pony.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unique and rememberable birthday gift -- or an odd yet thoughtful way to end a coupling.
