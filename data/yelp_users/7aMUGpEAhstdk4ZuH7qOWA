Came today to simply use the putting green and chipping green and was told that I have to pay $25.   There were a total of 5 people there. I wasn't bothering anyone nor was I costing them any extra money. I play this course all the time but after today I will no longer give my money to this course.   It's not nice enough to pay money to use the putting and chipping greens.  After this experience I drove down the street and used the facilities at the 500 club instead.

I've used this place for the past 2.5 years, about once a month. The service has gotten absolutely terrible. As I type this I've been waiting at terminal 3 for a shuttle for about 25 minutes, and it's 115 degrees outside. Every other parking facilities shuttle has been by 2-3 times.   I even have a discount card that gives me $2 off per day but I'd rather pay more at other facilities.   Every time I call the office to let them know I've been waiting I get someone that has an attitude problem.  I also noticed that there are a couple photos  that have a very pretty girl that "works" for the shuttle service. Every employee I've ever seen looks as if they just got out of prison.

I am an avid golfer and Phoenix native. Believe it or not this is the first time I played the Course   It was phenomenal. Greens were perfect. Fairways were ideal. Pace of place was OK. I was 1 of 4 and we were held up at every tee box on the back by the threesome in front of us   We will definitely be back, especially when the rates go down in a month or so.

I went in to this store for the first time and was confused and lost. Courtney took care my daughter and I. She walked us through the process and assisted us with the questions we had.   Courtney helped make my wife's Mother's Day extra special with the care and attentiveness she took in our visit to the store.   Keep it up Courtney.

Service was a little slow, the tacos were delicious.   What my girlfriend complained about: the guacamole had too many onions. Slow service.

The greens here are unplayable. They roll true and are in good shape but have so many undulations and terrible pin placements.   The other major downfall is the amount of bird shit all over the place. It's disgusting. I will never ever play this course again.

Course was in terrible shape. Paid $30 to hit off dirt fairways. Don't waste your time at this course.

Course is in bad shape. Greens are dried out, dead spots and lines through them. Most of the greens were actually black...don't waste your time here.

Gave this course another shot after a bad experience 9 months ago and I'm sad to say that it's worse. The greens are dead...they ended up refunding us 100% of our money.   DO NOT PLAY GOLF HERE

THE BAD: they charge for wifi!!?!? They call themselves a business friendly hotel and they charge up to $15/day for something that should be free. pool sucks, parking is $28 a night at the hotel. The iron sucks.   THE GOOD: a ton of food options around. The decor in the main lobby is great. We also enjoyed the flavored water downstairs.

Doug is phenomenal. He knew exactly what size and cut suit I needed by just looking. He is the reason I will return to this store.

Stood in front of the wireless thermostats for about 20 minutes before I saw someone. I asked for assistance and they responded: "this isn't my department" so they went and looked for someone...fair enough   Waited another 5 minutes or so and still nobody showed up. I flagged someone else down and the same scenario repeated itself.  I finally left and just ordered the Nest on Amazon for about $30 cheaper anyways.   It's only a matter of time before Amazon takes over because of terrible experiences like this.

Unlike most people, I go to Sam's Club for 2/3 things at a time.   Today I went in, grabbed my two items and headed to the checkout stands. Some old lady held up the entire line because she wanted to write a check. For god sakes, it's 2016..stop accepting checks and slowing everything down.   My complaint truly lies with the length of time I spend at the register. If Amazon sold food I'd never have to go to stores again.

Extremely slow service, hostess and manager were both rude. I noticed that 2 tables that sat after we did got served first.   4 out of every 10 people that walked in, walked right back out once they saw the line.   We waited 35 minutes for a table. This was my first and last time at this over priced Denny's

My friend and I booked a tee time over the phone about 3-4 days ago, but once we got to the golf course and presented our coupons (Arizona Pass Book) We were told that they would not honor them because we didn't book the tee time the day prior (yesterday)  The course was extremely slow (tee time was 12:07) and they told us we would have to pay $60 each. We decided to make a phone call to a neighboring course and they said we could tee of 45 minutes later for $35.  This is not the first time that my playing partner and I have been treated poorly at this course. It is a shame that they turn away good business, especially because my playing partner has lived at Vistancia for more than 6 years. He vows to never play there again, and I agree.   Trilogy is a nice course, although there are far superior courses on that side of town (Copper Canyon, Granite Falls)  Trilogy at Vistancia has absolutely terrible customer service, do not play at this course!

I switched from Verizon to Sprint on the iPhone forever plan.   Chris helped me out every step of the way and kept me up to speed on the entire process. I have complete confidence in Sprint. Chris is an awesome representative and everyone should ask for him.

The food was average and the place is nicely decorated.   Whoever reads these or manages the store needs to realize the asset they have in their employ Dominic. He greeted us, was courteous and even casually up sold us: "Would you guy like a side order for only a dollar more?" And "can I add a medium drink for a dollar more"  After Dominic took our order he swept and cleaned the place. He needs to be recognized as an amazing employee.

The reason that my wife and I go out of our way to find shoes is because of the associate that works at this location, her name is Hope. She always goes out of her way to help and is awesome at her job and a true asset to the company.

There was a small problem that I had with my dinner, I brought it to the managers attention and not only did he take care of my issues but he also promoted me to the chipotle farm club. I am so excited that I am not cashing in my free food cards. Mike Beltran is the reason I will come back to this location.

I know chipotle is always busy...the issue is that these employees are particularly slow. The line barely moves.

We went there during happy hour on a Sunday. We sat on the restaurant side and were the only ones there.   We ordered 2 appetizers (the flatbread pizza and bruschetta). The flatbread pizza came out quick and was delicious. We waited about 10-15 minutes for the bruschetta and it never came. We ultimately asked them to forget the bruschetta and bring the check.   Once we gave our card, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We legitimately waited 10 minutes and ended up asking the manager (who was walking by) to get our card. We never saw the waitress again. There were no apologies for this terrible service.   We will never ever return to this place.

Grace is extremely unprofessional. Answered her cell phone while dealing with customers to talk to what sounded like a CPS employee about a child.   Later in the day I was called and asked to come back and pay more knee because Grace did not charge me correctly. I will never go back to this establishment.

I wonder which escaped convict is going to try to up sell me today. How hard is it to understand I only want an oil change.   Everyone here had a neck tattoo.... And don't even get me started on that guy that jumps on my hood looking for a crack in my windshield. This place is like the 9th ward of car washes.

I'm not sure what happened to this place but they used to be on their game.   Here's a list of things that went wrong today at 9am:  -They forgot to give us a donut.  -They got my breakfast order wrong -When my wife asked where her drink was, they said their machine wasn't functioning correctly. (To their defense the drink came out and it was delicious) -When I asked for a knife, the blond girl had an attitude.  -The line was full of people sitting around waiting for their order or bringing things back   In the future I will go out of my way to go to another establishment for breakfast.

Never live here. I got my vehicle towed because it was backed in (I was in the middle of moving things as it happened) they've repeatedly lost packages. The residents that seem to be living here are questionable at best. I notice police cars here almost daily.  I've heard that there are many vacant apartments and management is nervous because nobody is renewing their leases. When I notified them of my non renewal request I received a follow up phone call with questions about why.

We were served breakfast at 7 am on July 1st. When we got our orange juices one was noticeably a lighter color and only filled 3/4 of the way. The girl had an attitude (breanna) when we asked to have it swapped out. We also were given a sandwich with cheese when specifically asked for no cheese. When they brought the sandwich back out it was still wrong.

Appointment was at 145. Got here right on time. We were asked to fill out paperwork which is understandable.   Ended up having to reschedule at 230 because we waited for an hour.   Completely unorganized.

Pristine condition and challenging. We tee'd off around 12 and paid $65. A ton of bunkers around the greens. Worth the drive out there. This is one of my new favorites. It was the finishing touch on my bachelor weekend.

We normally love this place.   We saw a roach in the bathroom and when we asked to speak to the manager the waitress said: "we don't really have a manager"   This is my last time coming here.   - former regulars.

Walked in on a Saturday exactly 4 pm and was told that they basically don't serve pizza until 5:15!? Myself and the group behind us walked out. Who the fuck doesn't serve food at 4 pm on a Saturday?

15 people in line and there's 1 lady working. She appears to be 70 years old. This is the very reason that the Postal Service is losing millions of dollars a year. This is a complete joke. I am writing this from the parking lot as people walk up to the door, see the line then walk right out. I assume to Fedex or UPS.

Bought the groupon and it wasn't honored. I came to this studio about 3 years ago for 1-2 sessions.    The groupon needs to be more clearly outlined...plus you would figure with a yoga studio at every corner they would just honor it and let me go in class.

I actually heard an employee say: "I get paid hourly, I don't need to work any faster"   I waited in line for 15 minutes to pick up a new mailbox key. Which they charged us $40 for.   I can't wait until the USPS shuts down completely.

Don't buy the Yelp coupon. It's not good during happy hour and Yelp doesn't say that (which it should before you buy it)

I traded in a gold cross about 3 months ago. With the store credit I was given I purchased another cross, only to find it on their website at a lower cost.   I went back to the store, returned the purchased cross and asked for our old cross back. I was told it would take a few weeks to ship it, which I understood. After nearly 2 months of no contact from Kay Jewelers I was told that unfortunately they misplaced the cross and it was nowhere to be found.   Upon further review I found that the local Kay Jeweler closed down (Norterra). I called another Kay Jewelers and was told that the cross was probably in the safe, then was told it was more than likely at the home office. Days later, the store called to inform me they could not find the cross and I would need to deal with the home office directly.   Home office told me a variety of different excuses as to where the cross was. Finally, a voice mail was left stating that they were willing to give me $80 store credit for their mistake. After many face to face complaints Kay Jewelers agreed to give me exactly $110 store credit; however, I was not permitted to spend more than $110 and pay the difference. This made it nearly impossible to use the store credit because nothing in the store is valued at $110.    Every time we have spoken to Kay Jewelers, they've given us an attitude as if this situation is our fault.

We waited 3 hours for a bay. I understand that it's busy on the weekends but that's insane. We also had to park a few blocks away.   The facility and golf is nice but from an overall experience standpoint there's no way I am going back on a weekend night.

I understanding that it's the grand opening but things seem very unorganized. The cashier in condescending in questioning everything you order. Ordering in itself is a challenge because you have to write down your order...since this is my first time here I was unsure on what to do. The gentleman taking the order was no help.   Food: Amazing.  Price: Great  Efficiency: Poor  Overall experience: Blah Will I be back: my wife likes it so yes.
