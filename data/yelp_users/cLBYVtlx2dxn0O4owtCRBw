The two ladies who work here are so wonderful. I came to this store from the reviews on Yelp and they did not disappoint!  I needed my bridesmaid dress altered since I am pregnant and they were so welcoming and understanding. They did not make me feel bad or causing an inconvenience because I was pregnant. It was so wonderful to work with them and they gave me suggestions for how to make the dress look better for my pregnancy. Not to mention it was so affordable! I am now wondering what else I can get altered just because I know they will be affordable and do a great job. They are sweethearts and I know I will be here again.

She did our wedding flowers and they were amazing and within our budget. She was so amazing that I never even worried about her and they were ready to go with all the arrangements and accessories! I love my flowers and would recommend her to anyone who is interested.

I had Lay as my nail technician and she was such a sweetheart! I loved the whole experience she gave for my spa pedicure and regular manicure. They had a great nail polish selection and extremely welcoming. The layout and chairs are very clean and tidy. The owner is very nice and ensures that you are comfortable and enjoying the experience. I'm so excited I found this salon because I have been looking for an affordable place that has a great atmosphere.

I have waited two months to post this to try and forget my experience and to be honest, am surprised she has such a high rating! Scheduling the appointment was easy and I was looking forward to a great experience based on her reviews. However, when it came to my appointment time, I could not find her location! Didn't other people have this same issue? I was a few minutes early so tried calling her several times to get help with directions and she never answered. I tried calling a fourth and final time before heading home when she answered. I told her I was in the area (by Paradise Bakery) but needed help finding her. She replied, "It is an individual suite within the building in the back of the parking lot and that she would meet me outside." I said "Great (excited that she would meet me), I am right here and will be there shortly". She then proceeded to make me feel bad that I was "late" by stating that she was "very busy today with a booked schedule", etc. etc. etc. with an attitude! I told her that I was not late and that I've been trying to find the place and call her but she never answered. She then changes her whole attitude and starts apologizing, even tried saying that with her accent people misunderstood her. No, lady, I didn't mistake your rude behavior with your accent! She then takes it to another level by saying that she sends out confirmation texts the night before, blah blah, blah. At this point I am shocked and frustrated, because I was even expecting a text the night/day before and never received it! When I told her that, she backs up and says "oh, okay... well I have been having trouble with my phone lately so they probably never went through"! What?! At that point I just cancelled. I didn't want to sit there awkwardly for a few hours after her rude reaction, let alone give her my money! Who knows, maybe she is great at hair, but her attitude was horrible. I just know that to this day I am glad I cancelled and stood up for myself. She called me back a few times and left a message with an apology and a discount, but I want to pay full price for a great experience.

I first came to the salon with a Groupon for a mani/pedi and they totally won me over! Not only was the nail service spectacular I added a waxing which was awesome. They are extremely attentive to your needs and their service. I now go to them for all my beauty services (hair, nails, and waxing) because the atmosphere and service is so professional. I am going to try their facial service for the first time in a week or so and am excited! I think others are noticing this as well because the salon has now expanded space and hired more employees.

It was our first time tonight and we can see why everyone loves it here. We got lucky finding two seats at the bar just as a couple stood up, otherwise our wait might have been much longer. The smoked wings fell off the bone. We don't know how we are ever going to be able to go back to regular wings ever again. My nachos were enormous. I only finished half. The Gluten free menu is extensive! My husband has an allergy to wheat so orders GF at restaurants and was pumped when he saw the million options of full sized meals - it was the same size as the regular menu. The three women bartenders mdwere all extremely friendly, attentive and did I say friendly? Even though they were slammed, they were happy and fast. What a rare combo! The only slight negative would be that the restroom was messy with toilet paper and towels on the floor and I was out of toilet paper in my stall (had to ask to "spare a square"). My husband said their restrooms were very clean. All in all a great first experience. Great atmosphere and it was packed with people. We will be back.

I bought a Groupon to experience this salon  for the spa manicure and pedicure before I commit to full price. When I called to schedule an appointment they were more than a week out, which is fine, but when I got to the salon for my long awaited appointment on a Saturday morning there were absolutely no other customers there and three stylists on their phones with other stylists walking in and talking in the back. In addition, my spa manicure was hardly a spa experience. The polish selection is very slim. There was just the removal of nail polish, filing, buffing and then the polish and we were done! No soaking, no delicious massage, I could have done better on my own! Then on to the pedicure, the massage chairs don't even have massage rollers, just annoying vibrations in one spot and you are put in a separate room with no entertainment. At least during the pedicure I received scrub and lotion massage, then the polish. Keep in mind, by this time (an hour later) only one or two other customers arrived. To top it all off, in order to leave a tip on my card, they charge $2! Lets just say I'm definitely not going to this salon again. I am going to stick to what I know best - Posh Nails.

Amazing! The custard with the berry is to die for! I just saw this location on Mill and am so excited! The other location was so far away in phoenix so we never went. Now it might become a weekly activity! Nom nom nom

Sadly disappointed. My husband and I stopped in for a quick beer on our day date and quickly realized it wasn't going to be the experience we were hoping for. They only had two waitresses for the entire bar and sitting area. 80% of people's beer glasses were empty. They had a good beer selection which is why I gave them a 2 star, but we said to each other that the management could probably do a lot better here with the potential this place has. Unfortunately we thought it might be just the day we were here but my husband went on to say that he came a few weeks ago and it was the same situation. Bummer

I love the hard wax she uses. She has answered every time I've called after hours and has scheduled me in no problem always with a great attitude! She has good deals and promotions and is priced reasonably for her services. I'm so glad she is so close to where I live!
