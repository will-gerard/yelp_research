Out dated decor, and stains on all the chairs. Our waitress was way too speedy, slamming plates down, and glaring at all her other tables while talking to us.   The food was decent. It may have tasted better if the experience was better.

Out dated decor, and stains on all the chairs. Our waitress was way too speedy, slamming plates down, and glaring at all her other tables while talking to us.   The food was decent and was out in decent time.  We had a gift card, so we couldn't let it go to waste.

I came here on behalf on Fireball Whiskey to promote the product, but ended up staying and hanging out with a friend afterwards.  The bartenders were super nice. I got a blue moon and some chicken tenders. They were both pretty good. I remember the prices being pretty good.   There was a lot of different type of people here, but it had a good vibe. Everyone was having fun, and there were no creepers, or anything. Really down to earth. I felt like I could just sit, eat, and have some low key fun.   It's a pretty big place. There's a bar, tables for eating/drinking, and lots of pool tables/games like darts, video games, etc.    I'm moving really close to this place next month, so I can see my husband and I coming here a lot so get a couple beers and grab some grub!

****Bring lotssss of cash and cold hard quarters. The rides and cafes only take cash, and lots of quarters for the animal food machines around the park.   The entrance fee is a bit pricey (you can pay with card here), especially for a family of 4. I would say if you took advantage of everything the zoo has to offer its worth it. We brought a double stroller and planned on staying the whole day, which we did.   From start to finish we were there 7 hours! We went through the zoo starting at the west entrance and ending at the aquarium and Dillion's restaurant.   They have a great petting zoo and playground which is great for switching it up and letting the kids run wild for a bit.   I really like how you get to interact with the animals. There are food machines everywhere so that you can feed the animals, and there is a kangaroo walk. Its just an open path where you can feed and pet kangaroo's if they let you!   We went on the sky ride, which is just like a ski lift that takes you on a 15-20 minute ride above the zoo. Tickets were $4 each, and free for kids under 3. I'd say it was worth it, great views and my kids loved seeing all the animals from above. There is also a train ride and boat ride.  There are a couple cafes around the park (food is average cost at most restaurants) and then Dillions, a bbq restaurant, with a great happy hour.

I go up and down Rural/Scottsdale Rd to and from work everyday, and when I saw this place, I had to go in.  I felt at home! This place is completely my style! I wanted everything in the store!!  Vintage Levi's, some destroyed and some still classic. The owner even custom designs some of his vintage finds. Just tell him what you want, or pick a pair already spruced up. It's a little pricey for those on a budget, but totally worth it.   Everything I've bought in here I wear almost everyday, because I love the pieces so much.   Customer service is awesome. I made new friends the minute I walked in. The decor is very trendy and hip, I love it.   They have a new loyal return customer right here.

Went there tonight with my whole family to celebrate my little sisters birthday!  Food was really good! I like more of the more messy mexican style food, but it was still great! Our waiter was fantastic, always topping off drinks, and it seemed like he was just happy to serve us. We had brought a cake for my sister, but he also brought out a delicious free dessert.   It's a beautiful restaurant. Colorful, festive, lots of cool art. The outside seating area is amazing. Flowers and plants everywhere, and a pretty fountain. There's a garden as you walk up to the door and the fresh flower aroma is so relaxing.   Was pretty slow, but it was late on a Wednesday night; would be a great time to stop in to avoid a rush. Heard its crazy busy on weekends.   I don't live on this side of town, but if I happen to be over here, I would definitely stop in again!

I recently moved to the area and needed my nails done. I just drove around until I found a place, and I came upon KT Nails.   It was a monday evening, and I was the only one when I walked in. I was instantly greeted and escorted to a seat. I got a gel polish, and a pedicure. The service was great and the price was good as well.   Lots of other people came in while I was getting serviced, and the staff was very friendly.   I want to check out a couple other places in the area, but I can see myself going back.

Club Forbidden is still open on Thursdays as a gay dance club. 18+ and 21+ to drink with a wristband.   It's mostly freshly turned 18 year olds, but at least there's liquor. Great if you don't want to drive all the way to Phoenix for Charlies, or Amsterdams. The music is good, and the DJ's always place requests!

My husband and I came here on Friday night with our 2 small kids. We got there about 630 and were seated right away before the dinner rush. Our server was nice and made some great suggestions that would work for our little family.  We ended up getting the Super Sampler which is a tray of 3 meats of your choice, a big bowl of bbq sauce and 2 sides. All the sides here are ENDLESS! So if you get macaroni and mashed potatoes, you can have as many bowls as you want throughout your dinner! I though that was awesome and great for families!!  I also got a pina colada, they were on special for 3 dollars. I wasn't expecting it to be so tasty!  When we were leaving our waitress let us know that kids eat free monday-thursday!!   It's a really great place for families, because the atmosphere is loud and fun, so no need to keep hushing your kids. Also good for couples looking for a fun night out. There is also a great little gift shop next door, but they close at 6.   We will, no doubt, be coming back here!

We were invited back to try out the service, and since I love the food here I had no problem coming back.  I will say our service was much better than what I stated in my earlier review. Our waitress was very friendly, funny, and had some great suggestions. Glad I can come back here to grub. :)   Come eat here!!

$1 movies every tuesday.  $2 movies every other day. Need I say more??  For the price of a Redbox, you get a theater experience, with the option of theater popcorn. The snacks and drinks aren't as cheap as the movie tickets, but they are less expensive than Harkins or AMC.   For a discounted theater, I'd say its in great shape, and I come here quite often. Whether I'm bored and don't want to sit at home, or looking for a cheap thrill.   I take my toddlers when there's a kids movie (which there's always several kid-friendly options), so I don't have to break the wallet for kids who are done at half a movie.   I would avoid most weekend nights since the theater is in a mall, and can be overrun with noisy, annoying teenaged size mall rats. But great any other day of the week.   I'm going tonight!

My step dad takes all of our families cars here, and now that I'm responsible for my own car I take mine here too. They are always straightforward and honest. Kevin is the guy upfront and always remembers me and makes conversation.   Whenever I have to get something expensive done he always explains things to me in a way that even I can understand! And will even get out tools or actually show me the problem. I don't know much about cars so I always call my step dad to ask him what I should do. Kevin always ends up on the phone with him, discussing what would be best for me or making small talk.   I feel comfortable and when talking to other realize how inexpensive they are. The services always seem pretty fast too. If you have any other questions or need a service done they don't offer like body work, Kevin can refer you to someone he trusts and knows would do a great job.    I would  highly recommend them to anyone in need of an auto shop.

This cute western themed yogurt place is right across the street from our apartment complex, so we often load our two toddlers up in the wagon, and take a little ride to get a treat!   It's a small place with only 6 or so (i forgot exactly) flavors at a time, but they change them up quite right before you start getting bored.   If you sign up for their text messages they'll text you whenever they have a new flavor or a deal going on. Don't worry, they don't text enough to blow up your phone or anything.   They also have coloring papers and crayons for the kids to doodle on, while us parents enjoy our frozen treat! It's the small things like this that really make a difference to me!  They do per oz, and I think it's about the same as any other place, and the selection of toppings is pretty good too.   We like it here!

I first went to the Orchard a little over a year ago to buy myself an Apple laptop. They have a range of products to choose from including; Macbooks, Macbook Pros, desktops, iPods, iPhones, etc. They also have a nice selection of accessories like colored keyboard covers, laptop cases, Apple software, chargers etc. If you need repair for you Apple products they do this too, even if not purchased from them. I asked how they acquire these products, and they said they buy used computers off of businesses that were leasing them, clean them up, and turn them around.   I purchased a 2009 Macbook a little over a year ago for $525. It came clean, fully loaded with all Microsoft software, iWork, pretty much everything you need for a basic laptop. Throughout the year I've had a few problems with the battery, CD slot, and hard drive. I put all the problems off thinking they were going to cost me, but recently I became fed up. I thought to myself, "I should've just bought a new Mac".    SIck of hearing me complain, my husband took my laptop back into the Orchard and explained to them what was going on. They took it for the night and called us to come back and get it the next day. We were so surprised! They replaced the battery, the cd drive, and hard drive, and the charger piece on the side, and gave me a cute pink keyboard cover; all for free! Since getting it back, I have no complaints and am still glad I went here to purchase my laptop. The fact that they replaced these pieces without trying to make a dime off me, shows that they care about their customers.

First things first; the service was terrible.   We had just finished a movie and wanted to continue the night with some food and drinks. My two other friends live in North Scottsdale so they were looking to me for ideas of places to go. I knew Mad Dog Saloon was new, and I had not been there yet., so thought it could be a good place to try out.  We walked in and sat on the patio. It wasn't very crowded or anything, but there were people there. It took the waitress 20 minutes to finally come over to us from talking up everyone else. When she came over she did not introduce herself, welcome us, or even make eye contact! She threw some food menus on the table and left....  We waited just a bit longer to see if she would come back....we waited about another 15 minutes...she never did. We never got to try the food, because we left.

This was my first and only Five Guys experience, so this review is just based on this specific location.  My whole family went on a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't super busy, but there were quite a few people there. Our food came out pretty fast, but half of our burgers were wrong.   The place was clean and up-kept, I'm mostly disappointed by the food.   I didn't think the taste was worth the pretty penny, or the portion. It wasn't awful, I just wasn't impressed and I wouldn't think of this place to suggest to anyone.

I've gone to every nail salon close to my house to try to find one that I'm happy at. Beauty Calls Nail Salon won my hands and feet!  I went on a Sunday at about 12. They were pretty busy, but were able to fit me in with only 10 minutes of waiting. I was immediately greeted and given a cold bottle of water.   They had quite a big selection of nail colors and well as gel polish colors. The decor was nice and relaxing, not cheesy or tacky.   As I waited I looked around and noticed a cute brochure with all the services and pricing offered. Not only do they do nails, but they offer waxing, facials, eyelash extensions, and eyelash/brow tinting. The pricing isn't bad, actually less expensive than the surrounding salons.   All the pedicure chairs and equipment was super clean and brand new, no 80's massage chairs here. They also had a huge tv in a perfect position for everyone in the salon to see.   I got a regular pedicure and a gel polish change. The girl took her time and was very gentle and soft with her tools. She did a great soothing massage, and made it last. She wasn't rushing or doing a bunch of other things while she was working on me. She also didn't try to have a full conversation with me either, which I like because I just like to relax!  Even though I didn't ask for a manicure, she still gave me a a oil/lotion massage after my gel polish.   I am definitely going back here over and over again. Worth every single penny!

Friends and I usually go to the Scottsdale location, but I live in Tempe so I'm super happy they opened one here!  Love it on Taco Tuesdays! Great specials! $1 tacos and $4 margs!  Our Margaritas last night were really good and strong! Music was loud, crowd was fun, staff was cool!
