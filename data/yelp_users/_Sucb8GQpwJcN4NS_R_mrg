I looooove Corner Deli!!!   I eat there at least once a week and their JALAPENO CORN CHOWDER only comes every few weeks and it is TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I get an email daily that tells me about the specials and the soups and every time I see that corn chowder on the list...I'm there! And they are expecting me!    I'm going to steal the recipe...shhhh don't tell anyone.    Corner Deli isn't exactly on the corner...but its around the corner!  And its perfect for those of you located in the Airpark!  They offer free delivery if you just can't get away from your desk.  The prices are affordable and the quality is out of this world!  They make all the sandwiches fresh when you order.  I'm also a big fan of their Turkey Ole sandwich.  With swiss cheese, lettuce, mayo and yummy green chilies!  They also offer breakfast burritos, bagels, sandwiches, soups, salads and ooey gooey brownies.    Monica who works the register is so friendly and charming.  I've even placed a phone order in the past and didn't make it to pick it up and Monica called to say she noticed my food had been sitting for awhile and asked if I wanted my soup re-heated!    If any of you are burnt out on the typical chains located in the Promenade, then just head around the corner to the Corner Deli and check it out.  You won't be disappointed!

I've been to 5th and Wine and loved the ambience.  So, I decided to try out Humble Pie and was greatly fulfilled!! Having studied abroad in Florence, I KNOW GOOD PIZZA!!!!  I know tastes vary from person to person, but in my opinion it was very well done!!!  We ordered the garlic fries and goat cheese roasted red pepper pizza.  Needless to say, NOTHING WAS LEFT ON THE TABLE!!!  I will be going back very soon to try the Pizza Cookie!!! ;)

I've never had a meal here that wasn't absolutely delicious! They even have a gluten free menu! This place is my kind of place because it's fresh and there are a lot of different flavor options even though it's all vegetarian.  I especially love the Lemongrass tofu dish along with the Eggplant and tofu dish. If I'm REALLY hungry though, I go for the hotpot! They make their lemonade fresh every day and it goes well with pretty much anything in my opinion.   My mom and I have become regulars whenever I'm up this way!

Hands down...I NEED Yogurtland once a week!!!!!  Noone can argue the increasing popularity and uproar of "do-it-yourself" yogurt businesses.  You can find on almost any corner or in any strip mall.....However, I am never as pleased as with Yogurtland's choices.   My fave flavor is the plain tart.  Noone has plain tart like Yogurtland's!  And when it comes to toppings they have yogurt chips...cereals...exotic fruits like lychee and mango (my fave) and even recently I noticed syrup toppings like marshmallow cream or butterscotch.  Not to mention their featured yogurt flavors like red velvet cupcake!!!  Sooooo good!  And I love how they post the nutritional information on the yogurt titles.  I find it useful when deciding how healthy I want to be...which...its hard to go wrong with yogurt in my opinion.  Definitely if you haven't checked this place out...GOOOO!!!   And don't forget Sprinkles cupcakes is right next door!

I have only been here twice, but both times were not so fun.  The first time was for a birthday party that included 45 guests.  Now, I'm not accustomed to great or even good service when there are that many people to take care of.  Having worked in the restaurant industry myself, I can understand the trials and tribulations that come from 45 drunken 20 somethings.....However, I do take note when 4/5 of the bills are taken care of 1 hour before the other 1/5 such that the majority of the party can move on to the next location long before the bills are received by the rest of the party.  Not to mention the fact that the server was not able to then clarify the bills such that it took them FOUR attempts to get the last few bills correct attitude included.  Again, I thought nothing of this at first.  So, I went back with just the bf.    The second time I went to Marcella's, the server forgot to offer bread, asked what we wanted to drink and never brought them and even took 30 minutes to ask us what we wanted to eat when the place was not even remotely full.  Needless to say I had to fill out a comment card.     I understand this is a newer restaurant in the newer area of fashion square, but I'd like to think that service would be a company's first priority when opening a new restaurant.  At least for me personally, if the service is great, I'm more likely to attribute poor food to the specific meal I picked rather than the restaurant as a whole.    To end on a positive note, I've heard great things about their prices for happy hour!

I've been going to this pharmacy for several years now and always felt like the pharmacists were overly grumpy. But then I got a heart condition 2.5 years ago and after spending lots of time at pharmacies I realize most pharmacists are like this as a general trend. Probably because they spend their day hearing from sick people, most of which who are likely paying way too much for meds. Nonetheless, my review isn't about this pharmacy's staff or attitudes because it's always been sub-par and I have accepted that.    As I mentioned earlier, I have a heart condition and as such I am on a beta blocker which keeps my heart from beating too fast. Several days ago, I re-filled my prescription and noticed the pills had changed slightly in size, but because it's a generic pill I assumed it was some kind of change in the formula. Well, that was NOT the case. Immediately, I felt a difference and got really concerned as my blood pressure dropped more than usual.  So, I went back to speak to a pharmacist about what changes may have taken place with the drug. As I was talking to the guy, Dave, who began to give me the typical "spiel" about how some manufacturers can change the drug on you - I took a closer look at the markings on the pill and pointed out that they didn't match what's on the bottle!  He looked into it in the computer while I googled it on my phone and turns out they filled a 40 mg tab when I'm supposed to be on 20 mg.   They gave me double the dosage!!    Now, I understand it's people filling these things and humans can easily make errors, BUT THIS IS MY HEART we are talking about here!! My boyfriend was with me and proceeded to ask Dave for the name of the person that filled the prescription and Dave proceeded to say that he "doesn't have the info right at the moment, but he can find out because they have cameras showing who did the filling." He then gave us the manager's business card. I work in the software industry. I have a hard time believing that it isn't in the system for him to find out at a moment's notice, but nonetheless he pushed it off on finding out later and proceeded to take the bottle and fill it with the right dosage.   This place just lost me as a customer/patient.

I don't have celiac, but I have been put on a gluten free diet for medical reasons. As such, I've had to be creative with my diet and this place satisfies me on those days when all I want is to feel like I can eat like I used to!!! I got one of their cakes for my stepdad for his birthday and he didn't even notice the difference!!!!  There are always yummy samples out to try new items. My favorites are the cupcakes, jalape√±o bagels and the awelicious bread. What a great place with great options!

Don't go here if all you have is an hour for lunch. The service is really horrible. Not only do the servers take forever to greet you, but they take forever to bring your drink and they'll leave the food under the heater for 10 minutes before they bring it to you.....all while the place isn't even busy...I've been here a few times in the past 4 years because I work close by.  I swear every time I decide to give it another try, I get a similar experience.  It usually has to do with the servers they hire. I don't know if they all have zero IQ's or what, but I swear there is nothing going on upstairs in a few of those girls minds. The most recent time I gave this place a shot I ordered a sandwich on gluten free bread. The server let the food sit under the heater for 10 minutes before bringing it over with a regular bun on it. When I asked for the gluten free bread again she just said "oh". Fast forward another 15 minutes, still no bread....she came to check on us and meanwhile I'm not able to eat my meal. We complained to the manager who was nice to comp the meal. Unfortunately, this place needs to get it together.

This place is a hidden gem in Old Town!!! The owner and chef is French. And he makes everything from scratch!! Even the ice cream!! Literally everything on the menu is always cooked just right with so much flavor. You can tell the owner takes pride in his work and his food. He always comes out to greet me and say thank you for coming in too!   Try the Croque Madame, the French Onion soup, and the macarons! There's also sometimes a special on the special board with chicken and a mushroom sauce that is to die for. :) But my ultimate fave is the Tripe Chocolate pudding dessert.   I love supporting local places and this place is one of my faves to support because of how great the owner and the food are!!

Love this place!! I went to it because I saw a Yelp Ad for it when it first opened up. One of the owners, Allen, greeted me at the door and took a great interest in what I thought about the food since they had just opened. I ordered the veggie platter for a take out lunch and was pleasantly surprised by a neat concoction of local fresh grilled veggies including asparagus and artichoke!  Apparently they change this dish up depending on what's in season and on the shelf. I took my parents there shortly after and they LOVED it! So we went back again with some guests visiting from out of town. Every time, amazing food!! And I just love that some dishes use local produce!   There's a big room in the back perfect for parties. And it's a great place for a first date!
