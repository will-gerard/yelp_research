Not impressed with lunch. Mostly rice and noodles. Barely any chicken or vegetables. Won't be going back

I have had several treatments at Delete and all of them have been successful, thanks to Dr Mundt. She is truly personable and sincere, which makes my visits enjoyable. She talks you through every treatment and never rushes through. Thank you Dr. Mundt!!

I've had such a great experience with Thurston Personal Training. He sets a customized meal plan to help you attain your specific goals, his group workouts are rigorous, and the results couldn't be better. In 5 weeks I have lost 9 pounds and I'm starting to see muscle definition. If you're looking for an out of shape trainer (you know- the one with the pot belly) go to a chain gym, if you're looking for an experienced, knowledgeable trainer/competitor go to Thurston.  Thanks for kicking my butt Seth!

We chose Hooters as a quick dining spot before a concert and quickly realized we made the wrong decision. Upon arrival we were greeted by a hostess that asked how many were in our party and let us know there was a 15-20 minute wait. We asked if the bar was open seating, to which she replied "yes, but there are not 2 seats beside each other and our manager does not like it when people stand by the bar to order drinks". To which, I asked if we could order drinks on the patio, which was also open seating, and then move to a table inside once one was ready (outside allows smoking so we did not want to stay out there). We were then told "if you gets drinks outside at a table you cannot move inside". What???? Who runs this place and how are they still open for business?? My husband went inside to "go to the bathroom" and quickly found 2 open seats at the bar, came out and got me, and we went in. As we were walking to the bar we realized that there were several open tables, all set and ready to serve guests, but they were on a wait...?!   Wings were cold and burger was overcooked. Never going there again.

5 stars for the food but I should never have to wait for the bartender to finish her personal and very angry yelling phone call to get service.

After 30 minutes waiting for my food I called to ask about it and was informed that there was only one driver and she would be right there. 20 minutes later I got the driver on the phone and she told me she tried to deliver my food but I wasn't home. Wrong! I was in the driveway the whole time working a garage sale. She finally realized she went to the wrong address and got it to me.... An hour after it was ordered! I called and spoke with the manager, who was quite nice, and he gave me a refund as well as a $10 credit.   The next day I helped with the garage sale again so I decided to use my $10 credit, but this time I drove there myself. Before I placed the order I explained about the credit so they tried to locate me in the system to verify... They couldn't find my information so I had to call in my order while standing at the register so that they could locate my account. Then they couldn't get the system to credit me so they kept taking other orders while I stood back and waited for them to figure it out. 20 minutes later we finally got the food and was able to pay.   While we were waiting there was a man trying to order for his kid. All he wanted was a slim with mayo added. The manager told the guy that mayo could not be added to that sandwich even though the man offered to pay extra....   I'm baffled. How can you screw up that many times with one person and then piss another person off by not letting them have mayo in such a short period of time ? Do you really expect to stay in business with this sort of service?
