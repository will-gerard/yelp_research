Mexican chain that is average at best.  Good atmosphere and long waits.  Margarita's are eh. Something was missing. Oh that's right, the booze!  Food is meh.  I ordered the: Grande Burrito - Shredded chicken with sour cream sauce, Mexican rice, cheese and refried beans all wrapped in a flour tortilla. Chicken didn't taste very fresh and it was oversalted (normal I guess).  Service was good. He was attentive. Prices were average.  Would not return...food isn't worth it.

I thought Newark was bad but Geez this place takes the cake.  1. Checking in is terrible so go early. 2. Security takes forever so again get there early. 3. Their TSA staff, I must admit, is friendly though. 4. They have a limited amount of restaurants and especially bars BUT they do have slots in the airport, who would have thunk. Probably the worst airport I have ever been too...Do Not Enjoy!

*Part of my: I didn't stay here, I just walked around or gambled tour* Experiencing Binion's is like seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Statue of Liberty in NJ (yes technically its in Jersey)! it's a staple of the Vegas old school strip. Seedy, check. Cheap, check. Fun, double check. I mean you can find a $1 Black Jack table, sit next to a high roller (by high roller I mean someone with all their teeth and two $20 bills). They serve beers in cans at the tables...priceless. If you are wondering, I broke even so it didn't lose any stars or no bitterness whatsoever.  You only come here for the experience...trust me.

Ranked #1 pizza in the US. No lie.  In their own words: "Cozy, brick-walled restaurant serving wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas & Italian small plates" Yeah the pizza is superb...and you wouldn't think of it especially in Phoenix. But it's awesome. Their bread which you can dip in oil was even better. No lie again.   But is the #1 in the US. In my opinion, no. It's definitely top 5 but NJ/NY/CT have the best pizza anywhere.  It's a small place that also has outside seating and it's waitress service. No slices here and their toppings vary from proscuitto to mushrooms.  Their pizza was near melt in your mouth. Heaven I tell you and it makes you remember how pizza should be.  We had:  *The bread which they bring out. I am still dreaming about it. Could be the best we had in ages.  *Local Organic Greens with Red Wine Vinaigrette - pass on it. It was just greens...and the same one.  *Green Olives - they come with the bread as well...tasty.  *Margherita - We added olives and Wood Roasted Mushrooms. So fing good! A small pie is enough to feed 2.  *Local beer on tap (they had just 1) and it tasted like bud...so not a good choice.  Otherwise this place is worth a stop for the tourist feeling.  Get their early or be prepared to wait. Seriously you can wait hours. We lucked out and were in/out in 30 minutes.

*Part of my "I didn't stay here, I just walked around or gambled tour* Wasn't overly impressed with this hotel. Yes the outside looks marvelous and the inside was gorgeous but the simple fact that I lost a lot of money at the tables and couldn't get a drink in the 1 hr I was there makes me never want to step foot in it again. The staff wasn't friendly as well. Especially the "No personality pit boss." I guess I am biter. Yes that's right, I am!

Good bagels are hard to find in Phoenix...and not surprising, this place is on par with chain bagel spots.  The service was good but the bagels were meh... I must say that for the area, it's a good choice to get your carb fix.  Think steps below Panera's... It's located in a hotel and gets quite busy.

Really nice open air shopping center. Downtown feel.  Parking can be a pain but if you can, park near the apartments.  Some stores available: Banana, Athleta, Chico's, COACH, J. Jill, Lucky Brand, Papyrus and pottery barn kids...just to name a few.  Restaurants:  Mastro's, Morton's, P.F. Changs and a few more.

This a GNC and Vitamin Shoppe in one. Lot's of selection for your health needs (vitamin, minerals, sports nutrition, supplements, diet, herbs and wellness ). Very clean and open. Staff is knowledgable and friendly. Prices are reasonable. There are several in AZ.

Here's the deal. I didn't do my research before coming to Vegas so I had no idea the Fremont Street Experience existed. I was half in the bag...ok probably 3/4's of the bag and dragged into the st because it was time.... "Why the f*ck did you drag me out of Binions? I was on a roll!" "Dude, you don't want to miss this" Now when you are a bit inebriated, you kind of lose judgement. I had the feeling I was out doors yet it was like a covered outdoor mall. Was I seeing things? Was I that banged up...then it proceeded to get dark...now I am freaking out (on the inside)...and music starts blasting and scantly clad chicks are above me...playing on the ceiling...it was like a movie theater on the ceiling...I thought I was seeing things...but I got my bearings straight and realized this was a video show with some damn good music...plus people could zip line which was like a mind blowing experience I am sure but that's irrelevant to this review...after about what seemed like 15 minutes of a great rock concert, it was over and everyone ran away like a bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the lights....freaky, cool, entertaining...a must see/do in Vegas.

Boy is this place hyped up! Everyone talks about how great In-N-Out is...the anticipation was high. The burger was a complete let down. I mean Five Guys is much better...and their fries too. Animal style...not so good. I just don't understand the hype. The experience was cool though. Taking a cab to this place and then flagging a cab in the lot to get back. Seems like it's common since everyone inside cabbed it. It's very busy but I must say I was disappointed...booooo!

Eh... Didn't have a meal here but did order a round of Sinatra's specialty drink (Sinatra Smash) after a so-so meal at Bolero. Well it cost me $150 for 8 drinks...holy rip off..!!! Yeah the atmosphere is relaxing and it's located at the Wynn Hotel but what the heck! Looking at all the people eating here, it's definitely not my cup of tea...high rollers, guys with women who if they didn't have money would never be caught dead with them and wanna be mobsters...  Skip this place unless you are willing to drop a fortune for a quick drink...

This was impressive. The precision of the fountains in relation to the music...amazing.  Although it does lose 1 star because I loathe the Bellagio Casino...hey you're related so you are guilty by association.  It's definitely a must see. Plus in hotter months, the mist from the fountains fells good...great show...and it's free. Rare in Vegas.

This place is ridiculous...in a great way!  Although we waited on a random Thursday morning for about a half hour, it was well worth it.  Service: Very good. Coffee was filled timely and waters were always topped off. Plus his suggestions were brilliant. Food: Since we wanted a mix of sweet (pancakes) and savory (meat and eggs) we decided to go with a scrambler (Santa Fe - Chorizo sausage, red jalape√±o pepper, onion & cheddar cheese) and a skillet (New Mexico - Chorizo sausage, onion, green pepper, tomato & avocado). It comes with pancakes on the side (2) AND you can choose any of their special ones for a little upcharge...score! Wildberry Bliss Cakes - Stuffed with blueberries, layered with vanilla mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze...Banana Cream Cakes - Fresh bananas & cream, graham cracker pecan crumb & caramel... Everything was perfect! The savory was seasoned and flavorful. The pancakes were heavy, sweet and delicious.  Prices: Inexpensive. All this food, coffee and tea was less than $30 with tip...no lie. I guess I am used to NJ/NY prices... If you visit Phoenix, this is a must go for breakfast! ENJOY!

Kimpton's never disappoint. Boutique style hotel with tons of amenities.  We dealt super friendly staff (especially the valet) and were given the white glove treatment (or so it seemed). Their rooms were spacious and beds super comfortable. Showers need some improvement...hate that there is no shower door...water would escape.  Location was perfect. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. Plus Chase Field and their hockey/bball area is within a stones throw. Super safe area as well. Lot's of activity and clean. Surprising.  Rates range from $199 and above (well worth it). Valet was $30 a day but you can self park if you're not lazy like me for less. I wanted convenience.  They have a cool lounge/bar inside with a hip vibe (prices are high so be prepared). If you are a member you can sometimes score a voucher to "raid the bar". We used it for water...don't judge.  All their locations are fantastic. We always choose KH for our hotel needs.  ENJOY!

Wowzer...seriously...Matt's Big Breakfast is the real deal!  Things to expect:  *You will wait no matter what time you go BUT the line moves fast.  *Their bacon is re-donk-u-lous! Seasoned with black pepper...oh man.  *Eggs are organic and cage-free, score!  *Go with Hog & Chick to get the best of both.  *Strawberry jam is home made and I could just drink it like a fruit drink...so good.  *Friendly service...mostly young kids who are going to school nearby. ASU.  *Inexpensive for the amount of food you get.  *Bread taste's like it's made in house...yummy.  *Coffee isn't life changing but it will do a good job of waking your butt up. *Check out their daily specials it happened to be the one my wife picked and it was delicious!

Hello deliciousness!  Picture a freshly made original donut topped with multiple concoctions.  Location shares space with other dining establishments. Didn't even know it was there. The aroma led me to it.  I split 3 - Key Lime (key lime glaze + graham crackers + powdered sugar). Mint something (didn't try it since I don't like mint but the Mrs gave it a thumbs up) and Mrs. Prunella (mixed berry glaze + cinnamon sugar). If I had my druthers I would have decided on Strawberry Shortcake.  They are over $2 each but if you buy in bunches they decrease in price.  Remember they come out hot so ask them to wait for it to cool before the toppings are put on.  Enjoy!
