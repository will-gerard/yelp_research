Gonna wait next time a mcflurry craving hits... My mcflurry looked like there was only one Oreo mixed in and half of it was outside the cup.   Got hounded for change coming and going, then a fight broke out in the Parking lot as we were leaving. Gotta remember not to return here ever! Yeesh! :-/

Saw a concert here, a Disney show, and a couple of basketball games! Love the spacious venue and every seat In the house seemed like a good seat! Staff is helpful when looking for an exit or the bathrooms, concession is pricey but what do you expect from a big arena like this one? I enjoy coming here, parking is a breeze, wether you park in their garage or an outside lot, it's easy to find and cheap!! :) can't wait for the next event I come here to see!

Came here for some tacos with my girls, that's what they were craving. I don't know why this location got so many low reviews, but as soon as we came in it was a good experience. Was immediately greeted. Tables were clean and had a basket of all the sauces they offer including ketchup! They took our order, and even took our tray of food to us when it was ready, we didn't wait long.  The bathrooms were decent and parking was easy since they had their own lot. The view while eating is people washing and vacuuming their cars at the car was next door. All in all a good food trip, for 50 cent tacos, we'll be back!

My husband wanted to come in here and check out a jigsaw he saw online. They didn't have the one he wanted so they offered to call another store but they didn't have it either. I didn't know jigsaws were so in demand! Lol, Anyhoo so that was nice of them to try, so we went to check out the Christmas trees in the outside lot. They were beautiful but not as tall as I wanted ours to be, but this location was helpful and if we are in a pinch and in this area we would come back.

It's an airport, it's gets me places, and it has cool shops and restaurants. My heart is still with SFO but this airport gets the job done when you wanna get away for a little bit! :-)

Where has this sandwich shop been all my life?!   The hubby and I were out on a Sunday afternoon and this place popped in my head for food cuz the hubby was getting the grumpies, lol. So I pulled out my handy dandy yelp app and found a location near us! And by George were we glad I did! Starting with the decor and the friendly greeting to the sandwiches everything was bomb diggity! The food so good I wish I got a bigger size! I got the Kali mist and the hubby got the dank sandwich. I was "highly" impressed and so was my husband with his choice. Right amount of spice with the chipotle mayo too.   Definitely glad we stopped in here today, will definitely be back in the future to try the other wonderful looking sandwiches! :)

Low on cash, come here for dinner! can't beat $5 ready pizzas, better than Costco pizza. They also have a deep dish pizza for $8. Drinks are a bit pricey so grab some 32 ozs from QT before heading here, lol.  Parking in front it okay, just hope you don't get there during primo dinner or lunch rush or you might have to wait for them to bake your pizza which isn't half bad because you'll get a fresh one rather than one that's been sitting in a warmer. Yay! :)

Delicious tacos! $6something for 3 tacos beans and rice and a mini salad. So good! Me and my husband both had the carne Assad tacos and they were good! My husband said his was kinda dry, but the flavor was there. Don't come here looking for a posh environment because it's not. It's a good ol taqueria and I wouldn't change a thing.  Parking lot is a little small, and it's kind of hard to spot the place at first glance but once you make it in there you'll be glad you tried them out! The red salsa is better than the green one, and they have Pepsi in a bottle! :)

Delicious burgers, great service, what else can you ask for??? Prices are fair, it's located on the corner of broadway and Lindsay tucked away in between a subway and a massage parlor.   Thought I already reviewed this place before but here it goes...  I ordered a double cheeseburger w/ onions, jalapeños and bacon. Delish! Everything worked together in a symphony of flavor. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were crisp and fresh. My daughters got a hotdog each and both finished theirs in record time! Hubby got a plain double cheeseburger and he loves the charbroiled flavor. We called in our order and it was ready in 10 mins and no mistakes on our order. Thumbs up!!

Came here for a late lunch today and must say we had a pleasant dining experience here. Staff was very friendly knowledgable of specials and drinks to try. Our food came out in a timely manner, didn't wait long. Our appetizers came BEFORE the meal which is great since some places bring em out at the same time as the main course which defeats the purpose of ordering appetizers in the first place. The restaurant was clean and our glasses were never empty and we didn't have to ask for them to come by when we needed something she came by frequently to check on us. This will be our go to Native New Yorker from now on and so close to the house! Very happy with checked this location out!

Never had a huge problem here, used to work at a Safeway in Cali and long lines is just something they need to work on..  I don't get my groceries here but we stop in to pay our SRP bill or get gas. Also good for last minute or late night munchie cravings. If you get there just at the right time they have the most amazing brownies for like $2.98! With your club card of course!   They have clean restrooms, the touchpad on the door appears when you touch it and ask the for the code from an employee. All in all pretty good, losing a star for the new cashier who gave my hubby a hard time for buying beer, even the bagger said I'm pretty sure he's over 21, and made him fill out some disclaimer saying he was over 21 and that his ID couldn't be swiped. Ugh! What a hassle, get your beer somewhere else lol

Came here to look for a new flat screen. Was instantly hounded down by a sales person with an iPad asking if we wanted to upgrade our phones. We kindly turned her down but she said just pretend I'm helping you and kept talking about how she didn't like apple products because she was an android user. Uhm... No offense but we don't care, we're looking for a tv and we like apple products. Lol, anyhow after we finished checking out the tv's as we were walking to the DVD section she kept following us and asking if we needed her to find anything on her iPad. The customer service here is a little over the top, and the tv's are way over priced. The only good thing is a fellow customer told us to check out Costco for the tv's because the prices were better.   So if you wanna come here don't say I warned you about the people in blue with iPads!

I cannot write a review worthy enough of this place.   They saved my life, had a severe infection in my gums from wisdom teeth, was in severe pain and they were so friendly and caring, I ALMOST forgot I was in pain.  The whole procedure, from the moment I walked in to the moment I left pain free took 45 mins! After care instructions were clear, was prescribed meds for soreness after surgery, and they told me to come the next day for a follow up.  I had zero to no pain after and was able to walk in to my follow up appointment with a smile on my face!  Thank you to the staff and doctors!! Will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is having wisdom teeth pain or issues, GREAT PRACTICE!!!!

Found all the toys advertised for Black Friday, no hassle, no fighting lol. Plus of you are a rewards member extra points! Glad I didn't bring the kids with me shopping we would have been here forever! Parking was a little scarce but what do you expect for the busiest shopping day of the year?  The staff were friendly and helpful, they were busy stocking shelves and made sure the store didn't look bare, glad we came here today! Will be back in the future!

Nice location, wasn't busy when me and my daughters got there.... We love the cheddar biscuits and I love the Bahama mama drink! The hubby isn't a fan so he didn't eat but, he's driving so I get to drink lol. Waitress was pleasant always checking on us, the kids enjoyed looking at the fresh lobster. Didn't wait too long for the food, and when we left we were very satisfied! Will come back to this location!   Parking was easy too, and it's right Across the street from the mall for walking off your meal!:-)

30% off everything! Including already reduced prices some were 50-75% off already! Besides the clothes, perfumes and shoes, they had great little end tables with unique gifts and stocking stuffers! Nearly finished all my Christmas shopping in this store! There wasn't any long lines and it wasn't too busy to the point of madness, just a good amount of people looking for a good deal!   Also for every $50 you spend you get $10! Happy me! :) glad we stopped in to look, ended up crossing off most things from my list thanks to this store! Haha, might even come back after today, happy shopping everyone!

Still got a good deal on a huge tv, and we didn't have to wait last night, great deals on everything else in the store as well. Was thinking maybe the staff was a little tired from the night before, kind of like zombies walking around mumbling help answers, but who can blame em? Got what we came for and a little more, and got out. Hubby is always happy when we are in and out of a store cuz he likes to shop on a schedule lol. This location was well stocked, happy we got out smart tv here!

This salon is very professional and friendly. It's very clean, spacious and it smells like apple pies inside lol. I got a gel manicure and my nail tech Theresa was very engaging and nice. She was meticulous and took her time cleaning my cuticles. The Polish was then applied with extreme care, but the polish I picked didn't want to go on evenly and she showed no sign of annoyance and patiently asked if I wanted to try another color. She was the one who noticed it before I did which is great because I know she didn't feel good sending me out with uneven coats. We finally found a color close enough to the one I originally picked but a little darker and it worked! She was very lovely to have as a tech, I will definitely be back to see her next time as well.  I paid $26 for my gel mani which is a great price compared to other salons I've peeped out. They take card and cash but would rather have the tip in cash! I wanna try a pedi next time! :)

Ok, was craving Chinese food, and being new to the area decided to yelp a couple places near us. UGH. Wish i tried a different place.  At first I was excited because I thought I had found THE place to go to for my Chinese food cravings. When i walked into the restaurant it was totally empty. The cook was eating soup and three other dishes at one of the tables and the hostess was sitting down reading a magazine. She totally jumped up and pretended to wipe a table as soon as she saw me but the cook seemed lost in his own world. She handed me a menu and it looked good so I ordered. The hostess had to yell something to the cook which woke him up, and he ran to the kitchen and started cooking. After 10 mins my order which consists of 4 dishes was hot ready and packed to go. I was happy until we got home and dug in. The dishes were greasy, tasted like a metal wok and soaked in soy sauce. I lost my appetite. The only thing I ended up eating was the egg rolls. Even the fortune cookie was stale.  If you want good chinese food, you can do better than here.

Oh my this location is horrible. There are hardly any toys in stock. The staff aren't very helpful and the game section is lacking any new games. Should have went to Target or walmart instead, at least they are stocking every night to prepare for Christmas. This store just looks like they gave up like yesterday. Yeesh.

Spacious, clean and friendly service. Came in to check out some Christmas decorations And they had some nice ones here. They also had wrapping paper and gift bags for a good price. Wouldn't come here for furniture or appliances, it's about the same price if not higher than Walmart or target.  Great parking, quiet area and good savings on most things!;)

This review is only for the lady that did my nails here yesterday. Her name was Nga and she was sweeter than honey pie. Not only was she courteous and engaging she was great at was she did. My nails came out perfect. Better than most nail technicians I have tried come high prices or low. She took her time but didn't have me in the chair forever. She always made sure I was comfy and was very gentle and didn't cut me with her tools.   The salon is small and it's inside a walmart But trust me go see Nga and you won't be disappointed. I paid $40 including tip for a pink and white full set. Which Is a deal for me coming from San Francisco where $40 is only a fill. Will definitely be coming back here for my pink and whites from now on. :)

Treasures all around! Found a great Mexican serving dishes here! It was only $3! Love finding little stuff like that for the house! Feels like I have a story to tell with everything I find! Great deals! This goodwill is organized and the staff are great with inventory info and new shipments and deals! So excited we stopped in here to check out the treasures! :-) will definitely come back here if we are in the area! Saturdays are super, with items 50% off! Yay! :-) have fun!!

This has to be the cleanest 99cents only store I have been to. Dunno if it's new or what but the items were stocked, employees were knowledgable with the items they sold, and there aren't any long crazy lines! They also have dairy products and eggs but not for a dollar. Walmart has those items for cheaper! Hehe sorry 99cents people gotta inform my peeps!  Parking lot is big enough where you always get pretty close parking all the time. They take cash and card and they have 7lb bags of ice for a dollar! Wish I knew that during the hotter months, but now I do! :)

This place is fun, and customer service was awesome, food is good, and prices are okay. Since I have to force my husband to come with me to seafood restaurants he actually had a great time here. He liked the ambiance and music. He loved the dancing, he actually joined in.   I got the steam pot with Dungeness crab, shrimp, corn and potatoes. Wish they had more spices but I'm just wishing they would open a boiling crab here in AZ. Anyway it was good and we enjoyed dinner here. It was kind of packed when we went, parking was kind of scarce but maybe because it's near a mall.

Friendly staff, and even though we were just browsing they were still attentive and gave us all the info we needed. He even offered to give us a call when they got new hard drives in next week for a lower price than what was in stock! We got some headphones for 10 bucks and the hubby got a car charger for his phone for 15! We were totally happy leaving this store, only reason I'm giving this store 4 stars is it smelled like BO inside lol!

Coming from CA was looking for a place similar to Rasputins or Amoeba. This place is pretty close but a little more expensive but still great none the less. Great selection of records and movies, and local music. Hubby likes looking for old school music and real hip hop albums. He found this place a while back and we've been to the one in Tempe which is smaller so this one was great for him to look in! They have great DVD and Blu ray trade value and little knick knacks and snacks too.  For trading in you need a AZ for this location but the one in Tempe a CA was ok, not sure why they have different rules here but good to know for next time! They take card, cash and trade in credit frm previous sales. The area is ok too and parking is plentiful. Losing one star for customer service that isn't that great but who needs me when you get lost in browsing for some great finds! :)

I friggin love this place! Got my daughter's a drawing table and a paper roll for the table and so excited to put it together tonight for them! It was only $49.99 way cheaper than pottery barn kids. Plus the food in their restaurant is so yummy, try the chocolate overload cake when your there, oh and of course the swedish meatballs! Yum!!   Also, they have family friendly parking up front! Say what??? :-)

This mall is sad. You will actually feel bad for this mall. Only a couple shops are open and they are either shoe stores, clothing or cell phones. The food court doesn't make any sense and not very inviting. Also there wasn't a mrs. Fields cuz I was craving cookies. Lol  Your better off going to the flea market for better stuff and cheaper prices!

I had a feeling it was gonna be bad but I didn't know it was gonna be this bad. Came in here looking for yarn, and I immediately didn't like any I liked or was worth looking at! The colors were a mix of 70's and late 80's ski suits or 90's glittering string for cats. Ugh, Anyhoo, saw a color and brand that was ok and when I saw the price I nearly hit the floor! $4 something for a ball of yarn not even enough for a mouse tea cozy. Your better off going to walmart for yarn, or any other place that specializes in arts and crafts, just not here.

Not my go to grocery store, but when I need a quick fix for a dessert craving I come here! They usually what I'm looking for wether it be a certain chocolate bar, or a tasty cream cheese filled croissant!   Like most grocery stores the cashier to customer ratio sucks, but not as bad as Walmart! Since I'm the duchess you already know I'll be back for more nom noms. ;)

Came in here after the angry crab to try and walk off my meal, it's always a treat to walk in and find treasures! Me and my daughter went straight for the book section! They had a sale for 50% off yellow tag items, so that was out target, find yellow tag books! Haha. We ended up getting a ton of Disney books for the kids and a handful of good books for mama! The hubby found a cute little figurine for out bookshelf and some CD's for a dollar each!   The staff was friendly, no lines when checking out, and were very informative on future sales at different locations as well as theirs! Will definitely come back!

Didn't know what to get my grandma until I saw this store! Thought it would be perfect to get her a gift card for here, and it was a breeze! Came in told them what I needed, rang it up at the register and then I was done! But I did look at some cool gadgets while I was in there, I couldn't help it! The staff was very nice and efficient, nice location and also great deals for Black Friday!

Nice store, great customer service. Came in here with my dad because he was looking for some ammo. Recommended this place when they didn't have what he needed at Walmart next door. He was in awe of how nice the selection was in here. I'm not too knowledgable with guns and ammo but he seemed to be like a kid in a candy store! With that said he got everything he needed and some. He is now ready for a zombie apocalypse. Guys at the hunting section were very polite and patient with whatever my dad wanted to see and touch, and he ended up buying a shitload of stuff because they were just so helpful. I'm pretty sure he will be back here when he is in town visiting! Great store!

Had a fun time shopping here with the hubby, got some stuff at v secret then headed over to the Mac store and grabbed Apple TV. Great shopping mall but would probably think it might be too hot for me here in the summer. We went and it was cold but then in the middle of our shopping trip it started to rain! :-( oh well still went home with a smile cuz of all the goodies we got.  Gets pretty packed, do your Christmas shopping done early! And bring a jacket in the winter months!

I don't think I'm gonna write a bad review today, I have just experienced great customer service all over town today!  Went in here because I am a fan of their products, usually their customer service isn't so great because they get so busy, but this story was nice and mellow and I was helped right away. I didn't catch her name but she helped me find a great holiday red for my lips and a nice winter frost for my eyes! Also re-upped on some liquid line and setting spray, love this location and the girls in this store, will definitely be back!

Sweet deals here! Mostly everything we bought was an extra 30% off the lowest ticketed price! Also spend over $100 get a $25 off purchases made on 1/1-2/2 spend $200 get $50 off! Sweeeet!! They had my size for shoes (7) which is hard to find when there are sales because it's so common, but they were fully stocked here! Got shoes for every member of the family! Love it when my budgeting works with sales in the store! The sales people were nice and were very helpful and lines weren't super long and moved along very quickly. Also if you don't want to walk a long ways this store is in between JCp outlet and Ross! Will definitely be back to use that $50 off in January! Yay! :-)

My family's fave restaurant to sit down and eat in! The food is great, we ask for extra thin extra cheese pepperoni pizza and its cooked to perfection every time! Cheesy garlic knots are a must try and the servers are always friendly and knowledgeable with what's on the menu!  Restaurant is clean and has a cool NY feel to it even here in the desert. My daughters love the pizza bites and they get a dessert with it as well! All smiles from my family at this spot!  Parking ia good, when they get busy you might have to wait a while but trust me it's worth it! :0)

Holy sh*t balls!! This place surprised me! Me and the hubby were looking for dinner before we went to the drive in and stumbled upon this place next to a QT. We went in and were fairly surprised by the prices. 90cents for a taco?? No way! There has to be a catch. But there wasn't! These carne asada tacos were bomb! They were nicely seasoned and the salsa that was served it was good with a nice kick to it! Totally not what we expected, the hubby ordered a burrito and even I wanted a bite!   They only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the staff wasn't that friendly, didn't greet us and didn't make much eye contact, weird but okay granted the service sucked, the food was good. If we're in the area and feeling like Mexican, we will be back here.

Besides the cool fortune I got, this panda sucks. The rice had old bits of previous rice they didn't cleAn from the pan, and the orange chicken tasted like the wok and old oil. Skip this place and try someplace else! My daughters were not happy, and that means mama ain't happy either! Won't come back.

Omg! Delicious gelato! I got strawberry, my dad got mango, my mom got Bacio (dark chocolate a/ hazelnuts) and my girls got Nutella! *drools* my daughters finished it all and the cute little cups they come in was like a little souvenir for them! The strawberry gelato tasted so freSh and the mango one my dad got tasted like pure mango, no add ins. Will definitely have to come back here and try the other flavors, a small sized cup which was $2.89 was a big enough serving for me, but if you wanna indulge with more they have take home sizes as well! Connected to a small Italian grocery store and restaurant makes you feel like your in little Italy! :-) a must try spot!

This was a nice park. It had. Playground, volleyball courts, picnic areas, a dog park, and mountain structure you can climb on. The playground area is pretty big, the equipment looks fairly new, and has a lot of trees surrounding the area for a cool breeze. Parking is close and easy, but it was a little busy today because there was a birthday party going on.  There was a grass area for playing football of frisbee, and another section for smaller kids near back of the park. There is also a small trail that leads to the rough terrain bike path or hiking trail! The dog area was fenced off which is perfect if you have a child who is afraid of big dogs jumping on her like my little one.   Will definitely come back when we are in the area!

The brother in law took us here for some tortas the other day, it's in a small shopping center. When we got inside you could see the fresh bread laid out, and two ladies in by the grill making tortas. They have a full menu not only sandwiches but burritos, plates, combos, and seafood dishes as well! They also have fresh juices and smoothies! I ordered the Milanesa torta, and it was delish! It was serves with potato chips and a jalapeño! So good! I finished the whole thing! I ate it so fast I forgot to take a pic!   They also had mariachi walking around taking song requests and our server was very nice! And they have the yummy ol coke in a bottle! Schweeeeet! Will definitely be back for some more delicious tortas!!

Nothing bad I can say about this store, except I wish it was bigger lol! The girls love coming here for their prizes for doing great in school or just cuz mama feels like spoiling them. The prices aren't bad compared to the toys r us express around the way, and my girls love how girly everything is! Sales people are great with the kids and they're ok with my girls looking and giggling with glee.  Love the stamp program but not sure if they honor it here when I asked them I don't think they understood my question so I just let it go, ;)

Was searching yelp for some baked goods while waiting for the hubby at QT and came across this lovely little gem! Prices are crazy cheap! And they sell homemade tortillas! Say whaaaaaat!? Bought a dozen for $2.50! And got an array for pastries all for under $8! I can't believe it! Lol definitely the place to go for dessert and sweet tooth fix on a budget! Can't wait to try the tortillas for dinner tonight! We will be coming back to this shop! Yay! :-)

Came here cuz I'm redecorating our living room and a friend told me to check this place out. So glad I listened! Lots of great home accents and DIY crafts to make your own decorations as well. They had a great clearance section, and mostly everything in the store was 50% off!  Even though some of the items were pricey to begin with, it came out to a decent price after the discount!  There is also a iphone app for the store and they have a coupon in the for 40% off your purchase so check it out! Losing one star because the employees here weren't very helpful, but I got along just fine without their help. Every aisle is labeled well and it was easy to find what I needed!

Came here for a valentine's dinner with the hubby. Small space but the food's flavor makes up for it immensely. We ordered the Kolkata pani puri for starters. Little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick peas, which you pour tamarind flavored water on. Although the flavors were there, they didn't work well together.   For the main course we got the Dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati rice and some garlic naan. This dish was delicious. The chicken was boneless and tender, the curry was rich with spices and heat. The garlic naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry. The serving size was perfect for two to share, and we even had enough to take home!  Great atmosphere, they even had a guy playing a sitar in the front of the restaurant! This restaurant is located in the India Plaza, next to a Indian grocery store, parking seems really scarce though, and make sure you make a reservation, they get booked!

Went here with the family yesterday, we were looking for a not overly priced water park checked yelp so we went! It was awesome! My daughter loved it, it was crowded but just of families having a blast and it wasn't too bad. Parents were actually watching their children, no rowdy people, and concession stand prices didn't go past $2! Also Admission on sundays are a dollar for the entire family from 12-2 on sundays!  Parking was not bad there were still spaces when we got there an hour after the place opened. You can bring food just no glass, but seating gets filled up quick so unless you bring your own chairs you will just have to make your own seating. There are lockers and also the lifeguards are every attentive. Would recommend this place for families to cool down and have fun without breaking the bank!

Hubby took me here a couple weeks ago, must say pretty good pizza!  We had to wait for about 45 mins for the pizza but it was worth the wait! And I can understand why it took so long, they had so many customers. Mostly regulars but I totally understand why they all keep coming back. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel like your part of the family!   Garlic knots are good especially with cheese, if you want quicker service call in your order before coming in and pick it up! No wait and you can enjoy your pizza in the comfort of your own home!

Was looking for some good carne asada tacos, thought I'd yelp a place close to home.  Found this place and UGH, so disappointed. I should have known it was to good to be true when I saw how much the tacos were. But decided to give it a try anyway. When our tacos came they were a little bigger than a half dollar coin. The meat didn't have any flavor, and ALL the salsas they offered were MILD. MILD! I couldn't believe it. I asked the girl putting more limes at the salsa bar which salsa I should use for the tacos she says "I don't know, I don't like any of them." WTF!? Are you serious??? I ended up just using the Tapatio at the table to get any kind of heat or flavor in my tacos.  If your looking for good tacos, your better off at a Sonoran hot dog/ taco truck in Phoenix. Will not be going back here again.

Came upon this place after me and the hubby didn't want to end our night with Filibertos or any other fast food chain. Yelp to the rescue! Saw that they had good reviews so we decided to check it out, and glad we did! The tacos were a good size, the price was right and the flavor was there. Unlike other taco places I've tried since moving here, this one reminded me of the taquerias in San Francisco.  also my husband liked the tacos which is saying a lot because he's picky with the foods he would actually admit to liking.  Will definitely be coming back here again! :)

Who doesn't love this store!? Came in here for my nephews who love LEGO and I must say they will be very happy with their gifts. Of course the staff was friendly and knowledgable, and of your a VIP member you get even more perks! Got a few sets that were on sale, and even saw some friends Lego sets for my girls! Me and the hubby even got cute little keychains of an ewok and boba fett! :)   Will definitely be back here! Either for sets or just individual parts we might need, great customer service and fun always gets the customers coming back for more!

One of the one times I'm glad I saved a coupon from my Valpak in the mail, got a 15% coupon off the dine in buffet! On the weekends dinner is $12.49 and with the coupon we only ended up paying$11.72 tax included! My hubby didn't eat cuz he doesn't like Chinese but I was happy! They had sushi, Mongolian and Chinese, also a small section of American food. The waitresses are very nice and was always checking on us!   You pay after you eat, which is new to me because most places make you pay first. Also just a warning make sure you eat all your food because they charge you 20% extra on your bill if you waste food! Overall was a good dinner experience, taking away a star for having to tell the buffet refreshers twice that they needed to bring out more crab legs lol.

Soooooo, when my food finalllllyyyy arrived, it was GOOD. There were other dishes I saw that I wanted to devour but my heart was set on the Longsilog. It was good, same as Manila Sunrise, just got faster service over there because it wasn't as busy.  They also had an American menu for burger, fries, popcorn chicken which worked out since my husband isn't fond of Filipino food. (ruude). lol the price was fair since there aren't a lot of filipino joints in AZ so I don't care if you charge me extra for a extra helping of garlic rice.   They take cash and card, and there's plenty of parking. Oh and if your looking for the place on yelp and you push Get Directions when your coming down Dunlap, it won't tell you if it's on the right or left and you might miss it. It's on the left. :-)

Oh how I wish I could leave a better star rating....  Friendly staff, there's only three of them, but non the less they make you feel right at home. The lady that did my toes was awesome and totally knew what she was doing when I asked for french tootsies. And the first time I came here the lady that did my gel mani was equally as awesome. My mistake was to get pink and whites by the husband. Don't get me wrong super nice guy, but the way he did my nails made my neck hurt. BECAUSE ALL MY NAILS WERE LEANING TO THE LEFT!!! I had to tilt my head every time to try and make them seem straight but to no success. And no its not my fingers that go to the left ,i made sure after i ripped them off 2 days after.  I guess you can say this review is strictly for the mister who does pink and whites, try the wife or the other lady or you'll be tilting your head to the left to the left...

Could be in here forever, sampling and buying, glad we stopped in here for our wine selections. Great array of wines from reds to whites, and everything in between. Customer service was perfect not too in your face but not ignoring us either. Got great help and found what we were looking for! Gotta look for one closer to the house, or maybe not... Lol

Finally went here a few weeks ago, and just barely writing my review. I know I know..   So glad I found this place, thanks to a couple of my YELP friends who told me this was the go to spot for fresh crab, and they didn't disappoint!! Made me miss home (SF) because there were a bunch of markets like this there, also got the car air freshener I have been looking for here. They also have restaurants all over the center where this wonderful market is located and will definitely go back and try em soon!  Parking is great not too packed, easy to find and close to home, so hip hip hurray for me!

I thought I reviewed this place but I guess not.. Lol  But i enjoyed our date night here! Not as fancy as other theaters but it was fairly clean and there was a lot of people there which made it seem presentable. Tickets are $2 and $1 on Tuesdays, would definitely be back here with my kids for a family film we never got to see or just for fun! Kinda hard to find but it's in between tj maxx and the Cheesecake Factory! :)

If there was a place I'd reenact the scene  from pretty woman where they snob her out of the store and she comes back and says "BIG MISTAKE!" It would be in one of these stores.   You shouldn't judge customers by the cover, you end up losing business.

Busy, but worth the wait! Always!! The burgers are juicy and yummy, and fries are freshly cooked and always good!  Got a double double, hubby got the same but plain, and daughter got a plain cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake! Yum! Can't go wrong with in and out!   (Was so hungry scarfed down the food and forgot to take pics! Waaah!) lol

I swear I don't know why I keep coming back, i think it's the cheap ass prices but not the long lines and very unhelpful staff.  And when you finally get to the front of the line because I guess its a rule to have 100 ppl waiting in line and have 1 reg. lane open 1 express lane for people with 1 items or less????? Who comes here for less than fifteen items?? if you need a drink or tissue paper go to a CVS less lines and probably better service!!!  Here's a tip! Since the employees here are so damn lazy if you bring up an item to the register and it doesn't have a price tag, you get to play guess the price and you get the item for HALF the price you thought it would be. Your welcome.

Nice store, friendly staff. Came in here to use my free cash from a previous purchase. Got some workout gear and outfits for the hubby and girls.   Taking out one star because they didn't have a lot of my size (s) but just happy my girls got to pick out their own outfits and it didn't break the bank! :) will be back for summer clothes soon!

First time selling here and will be back here if we need to sell CDs. The staff was super nice and was patient with the crate load of CDs we had! I believe they pay more for CDs, my cousin sold to Zia and got way less. Also if you have some CDs you want to sell and want to see what the current selling price is, just go to the F.Y.E website, enter Cd name and they will give you a price for your CD! This came in very handy so you know which CDs you really wanna bring for the most buck!  Takes about 20-25 mins for them to process your stuff which is quick when your looking at all the cool stuff they have in the store. When they are down they give you an itemized receipt of all the CDs they bought from you so you know what they were worth in the end! I think my hubby teared a little letting some of those CDs, very proud of him for being able to let go hehe. Glad we came here though, and it's close to home! :)

Since moving here frm Cali I still have a credit union, and this one of the locations I can take money out for free! There's a drive up ATM and when I need services inside the staff is always friendly and smiling. Will come here instead of the desert school across the street, they always give me a hard time.

This place is wonderful! Spacious, clean, and very friendly staff. This was my first time here and they made me feel like I have been coming here for years! There were many colors and designs to choose from so choosing a color was the only hard part of this visit. My nail tech was Kim and she was so sweet. She carefully cleaned and shaped my nails then buffed and applied the gel polish. Oh and get this, each nail station has a charger for whatever phone you have so it can charge while you get your nails done! Omg I was so happy with this haha.   I paid $25 for a Gel mani which is a great price. It's in a quaint little shopping center, there's plenty of parking they take cash and card and right now they are currently doing 10% off pedis if you check in to yelp! :) love this place, will have to come back and try the pedicures.

Nice drive in... Clear picture and great sound. Cheap admission and great concession stand. Only thing that was annoying, the cars in front of us were taking a lot of pics and using the flash as well! How rude! There was already lightning didn't need the flash show as well.   It's super empty on this Monday night which is okay by me and my husband on our date night! :) gotta go for Tuesday family night admission is $2 cheaper!

Yelp should really update their mobile app so us yelpers can write a review on the go cuz this review would have been written last thursday... Anywho....  Went here for the second time last week and was fairly happy with the experience. I needed a bunch of stuff done (pink & white removal, gel mani, pedi) and they were very nice and understanding. The only reason they are getting 4 stars is that they took forever but all is forgiven after seeing the turn out of my nails and toes! Just moved here and glad I finally found a nail salon worth coming back to! (the other ones i visited when i first got to arizona, is about to get a review next! hmph)

Came here a couple nights ago and we had a pleasant experience. No wait, was seated quickly and server was nice. Food was on point and we even had dessert, try the blondie! We even got to color a chili and they said they would put it up on the wall, haha.   Taking away one star because we had to ask twice for a to-go box. But other than that it was a good trip to Chili's. :)

Good food, but dining in isn't recommended! I'll stick to delivery next time! Parents were craving Chinese and from our experience from delivery the food was good but didn't think dining in would be that bad! .... They should just be a delivery resto, no dining in.

What a sexy place to go bowling. Fam frm the bay are visiting thought we would take em here, glad we did! They had a great time, service was great and the music was not bad and wasn't too loud... Food was good and so were the drinks but a little on the expensive side but what do I expect from a nice place like this. Totally worth it! And got to even dance to a few songs! :) will definitely be back, maybe next time for date night!

I love when I can go into a store and they have all the things I wanted that I saw online and you are in and out of there! Staff was great showing me where everything was, waiting in line didn't take forever even though it was pretty full in there. Ended up buying more stuff than I had originally planned but hey, walked out with a smile and new work out clothes! Got my mom a few tanks and got my cousin a new jacket, all in all a great shopping experience! Glad we came here!

You thought Walmart lines were bad, this place takes the cake! I wish I ate before coming here now. The information desk people are so rude and short it makes you not want to stay! The amount of people waiting is worse than Black Friday and you don't even get anything in the end except for new plates! La da dee da! Just moved here so I couldn't do anything online, and had to come in person. At least next year I can renew online or through mail! Avoid this place on Mondays at all costs, wish I went tomorrow but wanted to get this visit over and done with already. At this rate I will be leaving here Thursday.

Came here with my fam recommended by my mom's friend who lives here and met up with us. Her and her husband said this was one of the better buffets they have been to in the area and said we would like it too. We got there and it wasn't crazy busy, and the prices weren't too high. We got a table quickly and headed to the food! It was actually good! The sushi was fresh and they had steak! There was a spicy chicken dish that was so delish! The waitress takes the drink orders and brings them to the table and then checks on you periodically to see what else your party needs. It was about $97 for 9 people to eat including tip so it wasn't bad at all! Will definitely come back when with a huge group of people, totally worth it!

Third location we have been to and no complaints yet from us! Every location we went to was on point and delicious! Just happened to drive by and saw this location and cut off three cars to get here! Lol, we both got char burgers mine with grilled onions mmmmm and my hubby got his plain! (Weirdo, lol jk). The bun, meat and toppings come together in a lovely medley of deliciousness and a great balance of flavors! Cheers! :-)

Love the teriyaki, how it's not too fatty, and the sauce is amazing! The crunch roll is good too, but the miso soup I got was too hot to enjoy and ended not feeling like it after it cooled down.   Prices are a bit steep, but the quality is there. Will definitely be back when I'm craving quick Japanese!

Bomb ass wings! Yummy ATL style fries and free refills on drinks? Ftw! So glad we came here today! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the cashier kindly explained the specials and all the popular flavors. I ordered the honey habanero and garlic Parmesan wings with. Side of ATL style fries and Mac n cheese bites! Finger lickin' good! Will definitely come back here to try the other flavors, but def more of the honey habanero! Also if you join the text club you get 60 cent wings ever Tuesday! Yay! :-)

This place had juicy burgers, crisp fries and yummy onion rings! Took the fam from SF here and they loved it! The kids loved the chicken tenders and the frozen custard! So much yum! It was about $48 bucks for 7 people to eat so not bad! We came hungry and left full and satisfied. Staff was friendly and very efficient, the lines were taken care of in a orderly fashion because it was super packed, but they made it bearable. Will definitely come back for a juicy burger craving! :-)

Been here a couple of times and I thought I wrote a review about this place but I guess not. Better late than never! Found this place on yelp one night after a night of shopping and was craving a glazed donut! Bosa donuts to the rescue! The donuts were soft, warm and fluffy and oh so yummy! We got a dozen donuts and a boba drink!  I wish they had a stamp card for this place because free donuts is always a plus! My daughters love the chocolate, I love glazed and my husband likes the old fashioned kind! All yummy and fresh from here! Stop by and grab a dozen or two for family or friends, you won't regret it! :)

Great salon, great prices. Staff was friendly, attentive and listens to all your requests. The salon is spacious and clean, lots of gel colors to choose from, walk ins welcome and they weren't busy when we came, was in and out within 45 mins for 2 mani/pedis! We couldn't believe it!  It's tucked away in a small shopping center but this hidden gem certainly proves worthy of it's fab name, will definitely be coming back! Thanks for the great service and awesome nails! :)

Love that they look like they actually like what they do, well at least thats the vibe I get, thanks for the smile and caffeine ya'll! :)

Wow, got a lot of food and snacks for half the price of Walmart, really shocked I thought it wasn't going to be a huge difference, but my wallet says different! This place is huge compared to the FoodsCo I'm used to going to in CA. It's like a cheaper costco but you don't have to buy everything in bulk! Lines aren't crazy long like at walmart and staff are a lot friendlier too!   Plenty of parking, they take card and cash. And ice is 98cents for a 10lb bag! Not bad WinCo not bad... :)

Great location! Prices weren't hiked up, and the spread was huge! Today it was 50% off orange sticker items and Saturday Jan. 25th is 50% off the whole store!   Got more classic books, along with some to titles I have yet to read, good finds for my book collection! Also got 20% a $10 or more purchase! Yay! Will definitely be back to this location if we're in the area!   Also staff were friendly and knowledgable!

First place I tried for filipino food and fell in love. This place was quaint, staff was friendly and food was good. What else could you ask for? I got the longsilog and it was AWESOME. Just like back home, made me miss my mama :( lol.  You walk up to the counter tell em what you want, and there's your food. No waiting. You pay after you eat and are very satisfied. And they didn't charge me for an extra helping of rice, thank you very much. They take cash and card, tucked away though so you might miss it but totally worth it :)

Came here on a whim, loved Brett B's review so I decided to try this place out! They did a great job! My nails came out perfect and they have a ton of gel nail colors to chose from! Great prices, wish they were closer! But definitely worth the drive!  Also you get a punch card, 10 mani's and you get a free one! Woohoo! Glad I went here, very friendly staff, and I was in and out before I knew it! Will definitely be back! :)

People at the windows are courteous and welcoming and they always have great advice on how to save you money when sending stuff to loved ones.   It's hardly ever busy and there's plenty of parking. They take card and cash and will leave a smile on your face. :)

5 Stars for a covered playground!! LOL... sheesh so glad I found this park. My girls got to play in the shade and they had a blast! Bathrooms were near by so we didn't have to hike to one. There were picnic tables all around and trees surrounded the play area for a nice breeze!  This park is also a dog park but that area is completely fenced off just for dogs, which is awesome because I hate seeing a bunch of dog boo boo where my kids play. Looks like a good place to have a birthday party as well, plenty of parking so no worries for guests. Will take my girls here again soon!

Wow, came in to check the new location out and it didn't disappoint! The hubby is always looking for hard to find records and books and he almost always finds em here! This location was very organized, staff seemed on top of putting everything back to where it belonged and they were very helpful and knowledgable as well! we liked how the sections were nice separated and not bunched together like it was at the other location in Tempe.   Love the knick knacks they sold at the ends of the book shelves and love how they have a kid section for kid books. Will definitely be coming back!

Was really contemplating coming here due to the mixed reviews I read, but boy am I glad I went! It's not the boiling crab, but a close second in my book! We were instantly greeted and seated, it wasn't busy when we got there but it soon filled up. We were seated and out drink orders were taken almost immediately. As soon as our drinks arrived we ordered, 2 Dungeness crab for me, chicken fingers for the hubby and steamed rice for the girls. The market price for Dungeness crab was $14/lb today. Also keep in mind when coming here they don't do half pounds, you have to get the whole pound. Our food came out in 15 mins and we were grubbin! We got our choice of weapons to open the crab. And we dug in! It was glorious, I got the trifecta sauce/medium and it was pretty spicy! But oh so good! Our waiter came by to check on us frequently and each time we could just nod due to our faces stuffed with goodness. Free refills on the sodas and the steamed rice was $2. Reading the reviews I was scared that I wouldn't like the food, but I am so glad we came here! Will definite be back! Hope they stay good and fairly priced!
