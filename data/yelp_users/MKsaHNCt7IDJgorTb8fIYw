Each and every time that I've been here, whether I had an appointment or not, everyone has been very nice and helpful! They are crazy busy even on a weekday but the wait is worth it. I definitely recommend scheduling an appointment online, prior to coming in if its in regards to a tech support. Having an appointment will make your wait almost next to nothing. Nothing but good things to say about this store and its staff!

Been going here for over a year. Dr. Chow and staff are very friendly, professional and efficient. There's never a wait for my exam and my dental hygienist takes her time while the doctor is there to listen to all of your concerns. Highly recommended!

I went here this morning to pick up some coffee and bagels for my family and I. They were very helpful and courteous. There was a confusion on my order but it was my fault. It was easily fixed and I really appreciated the excellent customer service. Everything was neatly packaged and cups, utensils were in the bag without me asking.   I went around 8am and the place was packed so that should say something! I'm a Starbucks snob but I'll definitely reconsider my coffee choices!

I went here tonight to grab some food for friends at the urgent care around here. I'm baffled. First off, I give this place one star because of the girl taking my order. She was polite, apologized for making me wait on the intercom and whatnot. She is the ONLY reason they get a star! Granted, this is a drive though so I wasn't expecting ABOVE AND BEYOND service but a hello, good evening or do you need anything else would have been nice. The first guy at the window looked confused and the second guy who gave me my food didn't even say one word to me not even when I asked for napkins etc. All he could care about was how he had messed up the order in front of me. Not surprisingly, that car parked, and the driver entered the store... I would never go here if it wasn't a request from my friends. If you want better customer service, go to their competitor, CHICK FIL A. Order a salad, whatever your heart desires and they will ALWAYS BE NICE or at the very least, acknowledge you!

The dirtiest place ever and the girl at the cashier wasn't the friendliest either. I love Jamba Juice. Just wish that there was one closer in South Chandler. The staff at DQ is even nicer than these people!

At six o'clock, we called to be put on the wait list to be seated by 7. We were told that that was fine but once we showed up, we were told that we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. They should have told us that they were unable to do that since we drove pretty far...
