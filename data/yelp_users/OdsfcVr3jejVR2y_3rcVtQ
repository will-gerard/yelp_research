Every time I step foot in Ranch Market I feel like I've taken a mini vacation to Mexico; the music, the people, the prepared food, the colorful d√©cor.  I have to remind myself it's just a grocery store!  But not just any grocery store.  Some of the highlights of my trips, and things I suggest you try:  * Sweet breads are right at the entrance * Prepared quesadillas * The produce section is abounding with fresh vegetables, fruits, and herbs * There is a huge selection of seafood * I can't get enough of the horchata, but there is an entire drink and salsa bar.  I know the drinks are made fresh daily because I've been there at night when they're throwing out the remaining current day's batch, and the shrimp ceviche is outstanding.   The prices are extraordinarily inexpensive, and the service is great.  There is always somebody to tell you which selection of shrimp is the most fresh.  Whether you shop here for your regular groceries, or if you're preparing for you next carne asada cookout, Ranch Market is a good trip.

I've been taking my cleaning to Apollo Cleaners for  years.  When I moved about 3 years ago I tried another place that was closer to my home and work, and was sorely disappointed. Now I drive the extra mile, or 5, to take my cleaning to Apollo's.    They use environmentally friendly cleaning, so my clothes don't smell like chemicals when I pick them up.  The service is always friendly and courteous, and on the several occasions when the owner or his wife have been working the counter they seem genuinely appreciative of my business.    As long as I live in Phoenix, this is where I'll take my laundry, regardless of the distance.  Suggestion: Take your spare metal hangers with you for recycling.

I won't be back. Last time I dropped off my clothes, the girl behind the counter asked if I had unbuttoned all of my buttons, including my cuffs. It was then that I noticed another customer going through all his shirts to check his buttons. The employee informed me that she has been spending too much time checking everybodys buttons so we had to check them before leaving our laundry. Not that I mind checking and making her job easier, but 1) There had never been a sign or request for this before, and all but my cuffs were unbuttoned 2) She made me feel like a child who had done something wrong 3) It's her job, not mine. I'm the customer and I was made to feel foolish. It would have been much more appropriate to place a sign, or to state, "Going forward, please be sure all of your buttons are unbuttoned."  When I picked up my laundry the same girl was there again and I asked about the previous owners. Apparently she is their daughter and is being groomed to take over. She is a very negative person and needs to learn basic lessons in customer service. On the bright side, no more driving to Tempe for my dry cleaning; I can find bad service anywhere.

Is it just me or is it like a Phoenix treasure hunt trying to find this place?  Good thing I'm persistent or I would have ended up staying tired last night, or worse, at Starbucks.  So Lux is hard to spot, although it is conveniently located on Central and Indian School, right near a light rail stop.  Great coffee though and worth the hunt!  Walking in I found pretty much what I'd expect from a local coffee shop: trendy, laid back atmosphere, lots of comfy looking chairs, which were unfortunately all taken.  I did not however, expect it to be packed at 9:30 at night, half an hour before closing.  I ordered a latte; it was smooth and rich.  I would have mistaken it for a breve (made with half and half instead of milk) but I watched the barista make it and I'm sure it was done correctly.  I love a good breve but stopped drinking them because of the outrageous fat content.  Is it possible I've found a regular latte that tastes like a breve?  I'll be back tonight just to be sure!  Loved this place, and to top it off, I'm a sucker for a nifty design in my foam.

There are very few places that I'm completely OK with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast, much less in the Phoenix heat, but when it comes to Matt's Big Breakfast I don't think twice about it.  It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.  The place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.  In addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop.

I've been planning a visit to the Public Market for some time now, and was downtown today so I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had the "Friggin Chicken", which was friggin delicious.  The market fare is counter service, but when I was ordering the cashier was very friendly and courteous and brought my food to me out on the patio.  This was a very pleasant first experience, sitting on the patio reading a book, sipping my canned mint green tea, and eating my sandwich with a side of couscous.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and there were others nearby sharing a bottle of wine, or just finishing up their lunch with good conversation.  Speaking of the wine, there was an impressive wine and craft beer selection.  I'll be going back to sample the beverages very soon.  On my way out, I stopped at the coffee bar for a latte, which was much more bold and flavorful than your "Fast Food Coffee" variety; a great way to finish off my lunch.  If you're looking for a quick, inexpensive, fresh and local dining experience, check this place out.

I grew up in Oklahoma so I was raised on amazing BBQ. Think Texas or Kansas style, or a combination of the two. Since moving to Arizona I've had a very difficult time finding BBQ that meets up to my standards... Congratulations to Rudy's for being the first!  I ordered the moist (AKA fatty) brisket, and the jalapeno sausage. The meat was full of flavor, moist as promised, and without a hint of artificial smoke flavoring.  I tried the Rudy's beans and the potato salad on the side; the beans were great, but the potato salad was just OK. To be fair, I'm extremely picky about potato salad. For desert, the banana pudding and the peach cobbler made me feel like I was back home.  A couple of tips:  *Servings are family style so go with at least one friend, or have a huge appetite. *Beer and drinks are served in a bucket, and your food is served in a basket. *There will be families with kids, so be prepared for all that comes with that. *Rudy's provides everything you need to take your left-overs, and everything reheats well.  It's great to know that I can have great BBQ more often than when I go back home to see family! I'll definitely be back!

After several years of living on a tight budget while going back to school, which unfortunately included budget haircuts, walking into Model Citizen was a breath of fresh air. I'd noticed this salon while enjoying wine at the next door Central Wine, and while dining at Clever Koi. Both being great places, Model Citizen is among great company.  I did a bit of research of the stylists on the salon website and was pleased to see that Oliver listed "men's grooming specialist" among his expertise. I scheduled my first appointment with a text, which I love because it's such a time saver with my busy schedule.  Upon arriving the receptionist offered me a drink and a comfortable seat to wait. At my appointment time Oliver greeted me, took time to question me about what type of style I wanted and asked questions to be sure he truly understood what I wanted. Not only did I receive a spectacular haircut, there was an abundance of interesting conversation, free of charge (the conversation, not the haircut...lol).  It feels great to once again have a dedicated stylist working in a nicely situated salon to keep my hair looking the way I like. I'll definitely be going back for the foreseeable future.
