This place is horrible, it's dirty, it's falling apart, super ghetto, washers and dryers are old and don't wash and dry your clothes very well, after an hour of drying my clothes it's still damp, I guess the guy who's in charge doesn't remove the lint often and this place is almost always closed. The only reason I keep coming is because there's no other laundromats around this area.

I was just there and everyone was really nice to me. It's NOT true that employees  at the front desk are rude, they were very sweet to me and took me right away and this female blue eyes doctor was awesome! Thanks everyone, I had a great service :-)
