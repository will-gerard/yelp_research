I've eaten at Majerle's several times. Overall the food is decent for a grill, although nothing on the menu is spectacular.   Our service is good and the myriad TVs to watch sports on can't be beat.   Our last meal at Majerle's was on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the service was very good. Our waitress took care of us and our food was reliable as usual.   Majerle's is a great place to hang out and watch sports or to grab a quick bite. There are other grills with better food, but Majerle's makes up for it with atmosphere.

Excellent food and well worth the drive. I had the enchiladas suizas for a main course and absolutely loved them. Guacamole is tasty, with pomegranate mixed in to the avocado mix. Service is very good, too.

First time at AZ88 and I have to say I am impressed by the food, if not the service. We dined for lunch on a cloudy Friday afternoon and the mood outside seemed to affect the mood inside. As we entered, one waitress was leaning against a wall with her head resting on the wall. It wasn't too terribly busy and there seemed to be enough staff but getting drinks in a timely manner wasn't happening.  The food, however, was worth the discomfort. I ordered "The Chicken" and was impressed with the taste and the portions. Waffle fires were tasty but the vegetable and fruit side was rather slim (one carrot, one piece of broccoli, one piece of melon and one piece of pineapple).  We'll give it another try. Hopefully the service will improve.

I eat at Great Wall on a regular basis. The owner is always friendly and the staff makes sure you're taken care of when you dine in.  We usually order take out, which is always ready if you all ahead. Dining in can be hard on a busy night - there usually aren't a lot of open tables.  The food is terrific. I usually order orange chicken. The beef and broccoli and the Kung Pao shrimp and chicken is delicious.   If you're in the east Valley, it's definitely worth the trip.

I eat here regularly and I have to say, the place never disappoints. The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. The Straight Shooter with buttermilk pancakes, scrambled eggs and sausage is my favorite. The signature cocktails have real fruit in them and happy hour includes a big food menu.   I know for a while the wait times were lengthy but the added dining room fixed that. We hardly ever have to wait for a table at lunch time. I would definitely recommend!

We eat here often and the service is always very good. I prefer the Big Barbecue sandwich, which is even cheaper if you vine on Mondays. Cole slaw topper is a must. Also try the fired okra and then finish off with free ice cream! Definitely recommend!

Very good food, great ambiance and service.  We are here recently for lunch and I didn't know what to expect. It was a toss up between a rosemary chicken pasty (pronounced pas-tee) and a chicken pot pie pasty.  I went with the chicken pot pie and it was delicious. Big chunks of chicken, delicious vegetables and large chunks of potato.   The service was excellent (three different people stopped by to help) and the wait was minimal for lunchtime. I would definitely recommend.

We've brought all of our cars to this shop for years and the service keeps getting worse. Latest example: Five days in the shop. No one calls. No one can figure out what's wrong. We wait and wait for a call. I have to call the shop. The district manager answers and proceeds to tell me my son is lying about his car. Never mind the fact that Stamps Automotive can't fix the car. Terrible service. You've lost my business.
