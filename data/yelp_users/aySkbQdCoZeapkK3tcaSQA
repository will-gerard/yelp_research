No one at front desk to sit us. A waitress finally passes by and just tells us to sit any where. We pick a table in patio... no menús yet. We wait and wait. Finally try to get a waitress. Waitress comes over and says we can't sit in this area because it's closed off. We saw the sign but our table was not in that section, just next to it. We just left.

What I like about this gym: It's close to home and there are hardly any people in the morning. I prefer to go in the mornings if my shift at work permits because there is no wait for the machines or weights.  What I dislike about this gym: If I can't go to gym in the mornings I have to go in the evening, which I dread. The gym is super packed.  The weights are never re-racked. You always have to find a dumbbell when you need it. So f*cken annoying. You have to watch where you step also because weights are just left on the floor everywhere. I am surprised if anyone has not tripped or fallen over these weights. SAFETY HAZARD. Management needs to enforce this more.

I love coming here. If I want good fast quality Mexican food, then this is the place. My friend recommended this place to me after telling him that I miss eating tortas from back home. I was sold with my first torta on my first visit.  I come here so often that one of the girls knows me by name now.   I haven't tried the whole menu yet, but I do love the Paquime torta, carné asada torta, and ribeye torta. The cucumber drink is delicious too. I will also buy their deserts; pan dulce, tres leches, choco flan.
