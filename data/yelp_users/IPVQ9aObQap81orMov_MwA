Started coming here in December thanks to a fellow bearded friend that recommended this shop. Yuri was my barber, then Ari, and now he's my to go to guy for beards and close head shaves. Ari's work is phenomenal, and he knows exactly what I want, without me having to give detailed explanations on how I want my beard design to look like. I always call ahead and he's never been unavailable to see me, even before last minute outings and trips when I have to get my beard done. Ari is a world-class talent with beards, and that is a blessing for us guys with thick beards that grow back right away.   Furthermore, its hard to find a good, reliable barber in town, and the fact they book appointments for their clients is a big plus in my book. I recommend booking ahead as they are busy, and rightfully so, their service is top notch. The hot towel and head massage is also a big bonus.   For the reviewer complaining about haircuts taking ten minutes instead of 35-40 minutes, you are insane. Ari has done cuts for me that take regular barbers an hour, in less than 20 minutes when I am on a lunch break. They are strictly professional and focus on their clientele 100 percent. I have been away from giving Yelp reviews for more than 5 years, and the way this business has treated me merits my five star review. Keep up the good work Ari and Yuri.

I have to say, as a native Mexican and as an avid conoisseur of REAL Mexican food, Carolina's comes extremely close to the real thing. Unfortunately they are not quite there yet, but they are cutting it close. Their Breakfast menu definitely has to be the best around town when it comes to bombastic Chorizo Egg and Potatoes (Papas as we say in spanish) burritos, but any Chorizo burrito here is guaranteed to make your mouth water. Or as I like to say, it will feel like an orgy in your mouth!

FORGET ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION! YOU ARE HERE TO EAT REAL MEXICAN FOOD!   Extremely delicious, this is what AUTHENTIC is like. The moment you step inside, the smell of the grill and the food takes over and transports you to Sonora (or any other state in Mexico you'd like) and its pure magic.   Prompt service that defies that of other places. Appetizers free of charge: chips and salsa, good salsa btw, and a small cup of frijoles rancheros, which you have to try with crumbled chips and salsa in the mix, makes them spicier and adds more flavor.  Best bets here are their wonderful carne asada torta, quesadillas de carne asada, pollo asado, I havent not liked any of the stuff I have had here. If this place were inside the W per se, it would inspire a chain of restaurants.   Forget about the location, forget about the parking, forget about the fact that there might be homeless people outside, this is what true food tastes like in Mexico, and us Mexicans are lucky to have this place here in the Valley.

This place off 7th Ave north of Van Buren is my favorite Mexican food place for lunch since its the closest one to Downtown Phx that offers some delicious Mexican treats.   I have tried several things on their menu and hijole, todo esta bien rico, everything tastes yummy. My co-workers and I always recommend different plates from here to each others and each one of them has been a delight.  Let me start off with the fact that their flour tortillas are the best ones I have had in ALL OF PHX. They taste homemade and you can taste the authenticity of its flour mix, its just simply the best. Lets continue our tour of the food menu with the CARNE ASADA BURRITO, wow! The meat is seasoned to perfection and their lettuce is always fresh and so is their guacamole. I am NOT  a fan of burritos but this is one of the few places in which I WILL order a burrito because of its deliciousness.  The flautas plate is also yummy, the flautas are long and deep fried with shredded beef and they are delish.   A co-worker recommended that I try the Green Chile w Pork Quesadilla and add lime to it, and WOW, man, no words can describe the explosion of flavor that invades your tongue, its SO GOOD.   Furthermore, this place always feels warm and welcoming. The two girls that basically run the place always seem to know who their repeat customers are and they spoil us with our requests for more salsa and guacamole and one of them even has our drinks ready for us as soo as she sees us walk through the door.

Its amazing how people are led to believe that this place serves delicious Mexican food. I would like to know WHAT they are ordering. Been there once and never went back again thanks to their awful long lingering wait staff that took forever to bring us drinks and food along with the low quality of the food. The chicken enchiladas I ordered were disgusting to say the least, chicken was black and gross, and they were covered in a mountain of what seemmed to be green ooze that was trying to be salsa verde with nacho cheese. Never been back.

Best Mexican Gourmet Expensive made by a Latino chef who knows what she's doing and where she comes from place in Phoenix hands down! From the guacamole and chips, to their enchiladas and my personal favorite, the cochinita pibil, Barrio Cafe is a true gem to be experienced and enjoyed.   I have spent two birthdays there and it always makes me feel as though I have been transported back to Mexico. Better yet, they even have Coca-Cola from Mexico in a bottle, THE BEST! This actually makes them look more down to earth and humble compared to other wannabe upscale Mexican food places. Needless to say, I am such a fan that I purchased one of their t-shirts that say COMIDA CHINGONA, because it really is BADASS FOOD.

Their coffee isnt entirely convincing, the place is more style than substance (and flavor for that matter). The place isnt big enough and unfortunately I stopped going to this place because it seems to me, given my different experiences at this place, that minorities arent welcome here given the treatment of some of its staff and patrons. Unfortunately, at such time we didnt have any other alternative but Starbucks, until Lola's Coffee opened and welcomed us with open arms. Glad to say I have never looked back.  But putting their demeanor aside, their coffee isnt the best for the exorbitant prices you pay.

I fucking love this place. Its helped me expand my DVD collection tremendously at a cheap price. ZIA is the best place to get the latest art, independent,foreign and new releases on DVD at a great price even if they are used, I have never had a single problem with ANY of the used DVD's I have purchased there.   The CD collection is awesome and they usually have hard to find releases that places like Best Buy and Borders dont carry. Some other reviewer said he can get all these things for the same price on Ebay, but who wants to wait for their stuff to come in the mail and spend money on shipping and ending up with scratched material? ZIA is the place to be!

Unimpressed, been there once when it first opened and havent been back since. I have to say, after having experienced real Italian pizza made by real italians in Argentina,  any pizza establishment will have the unfortunate task of rising up to certain taste levels.   Not only is the menu limited, the place seems overcrowded and service convoluted. My pizza (if u can call it pizza) seemed like cardboard pizza and with not enough cheese or sauce. My friend had a calzone that he ate with disgust and disappointment.

What can I say that hasn't been said about this place, other than the fact that my dad was visiting from Mexico and found this place as he strolled through Downtown back when this place first opened and recommended it to me.  High wait times are WORTH THE WAIT. Even the water with lemon they have outside for you while you wait is delicious and satisfying. I always go for the special, and my oh my it has never disappointed. You can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food, its natural, organic, with lots of flavor and it smells fresh.  Their rosemary garlic potatoes are the best, their pancakes are a trip to Neverland, and their coffee is just as good as the one at a Starbucks.  This place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first, so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food. Plus, the owners wife always remembers me and even tells me she hasnt seen me in a long time when I go, its just a wonderful place that knows how to treat its customers and how to keep em happy.

I will NEVER come here again. A friend and I decided to try out this place after all the hype and positive reviews and I was even more excited since I love French pastries but our experience was an awful one. I ordered the Big Breakfast, which by the way is NOT big at all, the scrambled eggs were cold, the sausage was hard and didnt taste like sausage but the potato cake was good. The girl at the counter sure made me feel and look like an idiot when I ordered an iced mocha with soy milk (their sign says soy milk is extra) and she told me that they couldnt put the soy milk in the coffee because of some story about how the coffee was already made blah blah, then WHY do you offer soy milk as an option for your drinks?  When my friend ordered her breakfast and coffee she was charged 3.25 for a CUP of soy milk, that was enough for us to decide that this had turned into a sour and awfully expensive breakfast outing.   My food came out without toast but with the side of jelly, we then waited and waited and waited until we told a waitress that I was missing my toast and that my friend never got her breakfast, next thing you know the food came out and the poor waitress kept apologizing but it had been someone else's fault not hers, she asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and we said no. The owner did come out to check up on tables but not ours so I asked her why the hell is soy milk offered if they cant make an iced mocha with it and she gave me the same lame story about the coffee being made and wasn't apologetic at all for the fact that my friend was charged 3.25 for the cup of soy milk and I felt like she wrote me off and walked away, the same way I walked away from this place and I WILL never go back.

Ta Carbon is really a play on words on the traditional Mexican saying "Esta cabron". But rightfully said so, this place esta cabron, this place is badass!  Its small, set in a corner of a strip mall, almost hidden, but it gets lots of repeat business and its like going to someones house for a bbq!  The grill is on fire with four cooks on stand by, theres a salsa buffet style setting with lots of delicious salsas to choose from.  Their carne asada has got to be some of the best in town, and the food is always served right off the grill. Dont be scared, if you want badass Mexican food straight from the grill, this place is sthe shit!

Berrygood is definitely missing something, their yogurt is tolerable but its missing that tart flavor yogurt is supposed to have and it wasnt as sweet as I woud have liked. They also dont have a huge toppings selection to choose from.  I have to say I was disappointed. I had the mango sorbet, which had a small hint of mango, which means you could barely tell it was mango and I also got the chocolate one and it was so-so.

Went there with my group of bff's and we were extremely excited to try out this new place when it had barely opened. Unfortunately, I later realized that their prices made me feel like I had spent more than what I bargained for.  Way too much hype surround this place.  I had their carne asada quesadilla and carne asada tacos, the meat lacked flavor and none of the salsas were hot enough. It borders on authentic but it didnt do the trick for me. Plus the art inside looks too much like Rubio's, too bad its more expensive than Rubio's.   By the way, most of this food is available south of this establishment around 16th St and Van Buren in roach coaches for a much cheaper price and with salsas que de veras valen la pena y pican.

WOW! So this is what it must be like to eat at a little place by the bayou like in TRUE BLOOD, except that we have to settle for a small locale in a strip mall. Nevertheless, its all about the delicious food here.  I had the Poyboy with Shrimp and Fries and KA-CHING, I totally got my money's worth when the delicious french bread toasted to perfection entered my starving mouth. I of course, added some hot sauce and lime to the sandwich which only made it much more tasty and spicy.   I would have to add that thebreaded shrimp was the highlight of my visit to this place, it was thick, big  and meaty and was seasoned adequately. I only wish the restaurant were bigger so we wouldnt have to hear the patrons conversations in such close quarters.   Damn, just thinking about my pleasurable moment at FOL I am starting to crave another one of them PoBoys.

As a true Mexican from Mexico myself, I was skeptical of trying out this place at first, but it was love at first bite. I brought my madre along and she is an expert connoisseur of Mexican food and she enjoyed it as well. The guacamole is a mouth watering explosion in your mouth that will make you want to scream at first due to the amount of flavor transmitted to your senses by this exquisite recipe.  I have tried many things there, their fish tacos, their carne asada tacos and I have to say the carne asada tacos arent the best, the meat tends to have a sweet taste-like flavor that isn't really appropriate for Mexican food but their tortas were to die for as well as their Paloma drinks, delicious.  I due have some complaints, the service tends to be HORRIBLE, everytime I have been there it has been an awful experience dealing with their staff, and considering its a small place, there really shouldn't be a lack of service on their part. But if it weren't for their delicious food I wouldn't go back. Try their carne asada torta, its love at first bite.  By the way, the food isn't entirely authentic Mexican food as its more upscale gourmet American Mexican food but it does the job.

May I just say: this is what DOWNTOWN PHX needed! Friendly and welcoming staff who always greet with a smile that doesnt seem fake or plastered by their bosses.   The atmosphere is like out of an Almodovar or Woody Allen movie with windows with great views of its surrounding space, NYT and AZ Republic always available to read free of charge, free Wi-Fi that works extremely fast and well, cool couches that create a 'lets hang at the coffeeshop Friends style" vibe, but in the end, their coffee is what really got me going back to visit.  The Matador is a drink that seems to be unbeaten by any other place in town, its a delicious mixture of cocoa and cinammon that is to die for. Either iced or hot, its guaranteed to make you a fan. I am usually a  soy latte type of guy with no whip but here, YOU WILL WANT to get the whip since its homemade and extremely delicious and I have to say, it tastes like whip cream made in another country, it tastes almost natural and not processed.   I hope they take over that whole plaza now that the pet store next door closed because they need more space! Its hard to hang out there when its really packed and some people need to stop taking up an entire table just so they can use their laptops.

I love the original location and I have given it much praise since I do love their coffee, especially the Matador. I was so excited to come here ever since I heard that they opened a location downtown but WHAT A disappointment it has been. I honestly just dont feel welcome like I do at the other location and just like PREVIOUS reviews have stated, the staff is rude, especially the guy that makes the coffee makes me feel like I am unwanted as a customer there and same goes for the cashier. The owner Daniel? is really cool and always greets people nicely but the staff at this location is just too good for the public or something, plus some of those chairs are extremely uncomfortable, so for now I will have to skip this location and go to the one that's farthest from me to get my delicious Matador.

What can I say? Fucking delicious, which in my vocab is the equivalent to a five star review. WOW! Amazing salsa bar with bland salsas for those scared of the real hot ones, along with some AMAZING tasting salsas that are hot but even so, you cannot stop eating them!  The chips brought to the table as an appetizer aren't the best but that was about the only complaint I had. I ordered a Pepsi and it didn't taste like it had sugar at all so I returned it and the girl gladly exchanged it and didn't give me any beef about it, she was so chatty friendly and witty and she recommended the Cochinita Pibil Quesadilla, and I said oh hell why not? Lets have it as an appetizer while I waited for my friend to get there, well was I in for a big surprise! It was ORGASMIC, with some of the best cochinita pibil I have ever had in my entire life, so warm and with the perfect level of spicyness, I even added one of the hot salsas on top to the quesadilla, it was even more delicious after that, and the queso fresco it had on top was just to die for.  I was actually way too full to even finish the quesadilla, and way too full to even order one of their delicious tacos which according to my friend, were also orgasmic. I cannot wait to go back and will definitely become a repeat customer. FYI, the girl told us that they are supposed to have a bar soon, but in the meantime, each guest is allowed to bring a beer into the establishment. WAY COOL.   Super lugar, de lo mejor!

I walked in needing a quick cut and beard trim. I am pretty picky and skeptical about barbers and their so called expertise with beards, but Gregory the owner proved me wrong. He told me I was gonna come out looking sharp and I sure did , I hardly explained what I needed done, he just knew, and he gave me tips on how to keep my beard looking nice and sharp. He did it all in less than 40 minutes, for an AWESOME price, I was so impressed afterwards as my beard trim/design was pure perfection, and good barbers are hard to find. I had been there before just for a cut, but I was blown away this time by Gregory's skills and for knowing exactly what his customers want.   I will definitely return and I highly recommend this place.
