Great good but long wait time to be seated and get our food order.  Additional parking is across the street so be prepared for a little bit of a walk. One of my favorite things, it is dog friendly! Make sure to tell the Hostess when you put your name on the wait list there is a dog in your party.  It does matter where you will be sat and could extend or help your wait time. We learned the hard way. Don't make our mistake!

My favorite place for brunch in the Chandler/Ahwatukee area! Amazing menu and food! The Mimosa/Bloody Mary bar is so much fun! Cool thing to share, the Brunch menu is available till 3:00pm on the weekend. Sleep in then come here!

Great pizza here!  Saucy pizza and hearty sausage!  Very happy with this recent lunch option. On their website they have daily specials.  Good prices, great special and great pizza.  What more could you want? :)

Not a good experience with management. Had an issue with being upcharged for me dinner when I had expressed not wanting to pay for extras. Manager made me feel like she was doing me a one time favor. Felt she was reluctant to comp my upcharge.  Could have been avoided all together if the serving staff knew the menu better.

Celebrated my birthday here this year.  I had been to the Desert Ridge location before and this was my first time dining at this location.  I was really excited to celebrate here but the overall experience fell short.  Great food but average service.  I will say the extras they provided for it being a special occasion are awesome.  Not sure if I will visit this location again but remain a fan of the restaurant.

Wasn't greeting ever! Caught on there was a wait list at the counter you need to interupt the person there to get your name on the list. Food was average and portion average to small. I was put off by there only being one bathroom as in single room for the whole resturant and kitchen to share. Mom and pop operation was the best charm.

Great take out!  We usually dine-in but decided to grab take out this time.  Very impressed with the portions and the offer of fresh cheese which I am spoiled by while dinning in.  I even tried something different from what I usually get.  I continue to be impressed by this restaurant!

Split three different sandwiches with my co-workers for lunch today. Couldn't pick a favorite. They were all amazing!

Love this new location and our first visit! Food and service was amazing! Visited on a holiday and the service didn't disappoint. I don't live near this location but will visit again and will bring the rest of the family!
