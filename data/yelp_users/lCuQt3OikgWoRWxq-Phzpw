The service at this Eggery is always friendly and fast; the food is always great. All of the egg dishes are tasty as you'd expect from the name.  Their pancakes--both whole wheat and buttermilk--are terrific.

No comic book store in the Valley can top Samurai's knowledgable and friendly customer service.  Come for the comics; stay for the fun environment.

Ticoz is one of my favorite places and I always have a good experience when I vist there.   With some restaurants I find a dish that I like so much that I have trouble ordering anything else no matter how good the other dish sounds, and that's the case at Ticoz.  So I recommend the outstanding Coconut Ginger Curry.  For an appetizer, it's hard to beat the guacammus--a hummus and guacamole blend--or the chips and assorted salsas.

Before I found The Root, I had a difficult time finding a stylist that could style curly hair in a professional but stylish way.  Thankfully, Roxanne understood exactly what I needed and immediately saw ways to implement.  I wish I'd found this place years ago.

I eat at the Beach House at least once a week.  The fish tacos and carne asada tacos are my favorites, but I recommend checking the daily specials before ordering.  The food is always hot and fresh, and the service always friendly.

I received an unsolicited text message from this establishment.

Extraordinarily unfriendly.  We came to have a goodbye party for a friend and not only would they not let us share a cake because it was outside food, they yelled at us for using their knife to cut it.

I've been treated to fantastic food and friendly service every time that I've dined at Escobar.  It's quickly becoming a favorite for Mexican food.  I cannot recommend the guacamole enough.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip the guac.
