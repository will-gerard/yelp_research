One of my favorite Asian food places in town!  Food is fresh and delicious, and extremely reasonable prices!  My usual: potstickers, wontons, and general tao chicken.  Other favorites: panang curry, panang noodles, fried rice, cashew chicken, and most things I've eaten here :)  Service is also amazing, handled by Theresa!

Extremely dissatisfied!  Horrible company to work with!  They are rude, have held on to my money since April 29th (it is now May 25th) and the job is still not done!!!

Even for airport food this is pretty low quality. Step up your game if you expect to stay in terminal 4!  Ordered a margherita pizza...very plain, flimsy crust, underwhelming.

Fantastic food and great service at this 2nd location (original on 7th st). The $5 lunch special for 2 slices and a soda can not be beat! Special thanks to Nancy and Eric for their friendly and superb service!!!

Delicious ice cream made from great ingredients. Love the mini hot fudge sundae with various ice cream flavors each time! Glad this new location is close to home!

After going to a few dealerships and test driving several vehicles before being so frustrated I had to leave without making a purchase, Subaru was an extremely refreshing change of pace. James the salesman was incredibly friendly, professional, and helpful.  He did not once make me feel pressured into purchasing a vehicle.  I ended up leaving with a 2012 subaru impreza.  Regina was fantastic and did not give me any issues for wanting to finance through my own bank, Wells Fargo. In and out in a relatively short time, great customer service--honest and friendly. I am so excited for my new (used) car!!
