The selection of bikes and accessories here is pretty good, but the service was terrible. These were the most unfriendly, annoyed, least helpful people I've ever experienced at a bike shop. They were annoyed that we got there 20 minutes before closing and practically shooed us out the door promptly at 5 'til. We rode our bikes there and bought a basket for my cruiser (and a couple other things) and asked them if they had a tool we could use to put it on real quick. They said "maybe if you got here 25 minutes earlier we could help you." I mean, I get it, you're closing, but you don't have to be so rude. It would probably have taken you five minutes to put it on since you probably do that exact thing about 5 times a day. Plus, we have been to a lot of bike shops and they are usually the most friendly people, willing to stay an extra few minutes to earn your business. We've spent thousands of dollars at other bike shops and we won't be going to this one again, even though it's just blocks from our house.

Let me just start by saying that we frequent this establishment because the sushi is amazing. We always order the sunset strip and sometimes the pearl necklace (spicy jalepenos!) and sometimes the red zeppelin. The pork tacos are pretty freaking amazing, too.   The guy who bartends often (I think maybe his name is Steve, but I honestly am not sure if he's ever told us?) is so awesome. Great customer service, always remembers us and chats us up. The owner, however, has been rude to us on several occasions. One time she brought us the wrong beer and wouldn't take it off our bill because she had already opened it and couldn't resell it. I hardly see how that is our fault, but whatever. We let it slide because overall, we always have a good time and the food never disappoints.   Also try the sparkling sake, it's a treat. They have a discount card and specials throughout the week as well (Tuna Tuesday, etc.). Parking is never an issue, which is nice in Old Town.

My eight-year-old boxer had been limping for several months. Another vet diagnosed it as arthritis but it had gotten worse so I called Sonora Veterinary Specialists (because Arcadia Animal Clinic recommended them). They got me in the next day with Dr. Rizzo. The vet tech was super friendly and knowledgeable and Dr. Rizzo was amazing. She took time to talk to us about all of the possibilities and asked if she could take some x-rays (and the vet tech told us how much they would cost before doing them).   Once the x-rays were done, Dr. Rizzo took us back to the office to see them on the computer. She showed us exactly what was going on in Scout's spine, which as it turns out, is disc disease, which is causing pinched nerves and shooting pains down her leg (the arthritis is merely secondary to this major issue). (She also was paged while she was with us, but she called the front desk to let them know she couldn't take any phone calls right then because she was with a patient.)   She prescribed Prednisone (steroids) and Dasuquin (a prescription anti-imflammatory shown to work better than OTC joint supplements). After three weeks, Scout will be off the Prednisone and shouldn't need another round of it for a long time, maybe not ever. It's been five days and she is already moving around so much better.   Another thing I would like to point out is that upon Scout's discharge, both the doctor and the vet tech thoroughly went over the treatment plan and also advised that while she is on the Prednisone, she will need extra water and extra potty breaks and that she may even have an accident in the house. This has all proven true, and I'm glad they told me this so that I wasn't alarmed when it happened. Dr. Rizzo said to call her in two weeks to check in and the front desk clerk was very friendly upon checkout.   I would highly recommend this office for emergency or specialist care for your pet. I trust them and I am so thankful they gave me peace of mind for my dog. It was worth every penny.

We love this neighborhood bar. It's an awesome place to watch football, plenty of TVs that you can see from every seat, even the patio. The food is pretty amazing (you've gotta try the grilled wings), the beer selection is fantastic and they make a mean (and huge) margarita. The service is usually good, though can be hit or miss when they are really busy. I think the only things that could be better about this place are the parking situation* (valet fills up fast and the closest backup option is the Safeway parking lot across the intersection) and the bathroom situation (the restrooms are on the "family" side of the restaurant, opposite from the bar so it's a long walk). But we consider this our go-to Sunday bar and have also come for dinner and trivia during the week.   *If you live close, there is plenty of beach cruiser parking.
