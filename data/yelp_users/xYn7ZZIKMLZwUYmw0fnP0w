Great, responsive and courteous staff.  Charlie did a great job on my haircut.  Faye does amazing facials.  They're also very charitable donating to nonprofits.  Prices are good and the salon is always clean.

First time here, been meaning to try it for years.  The fried okra is good, as was the coleslaw.  I ordered the "small" chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes, it was delish.  Couldn't finish it.   Boyfriend had the regular order of Chicken fried steak and it was huge.  Couldnt finish it. Our waitress was SUPER nice and the food and drinks came timely.  Great hospitality, great food.  Yummy comfort food, country restaurant with a very inviting and homeie feel.  We will eat here again.

The management at this complex is horrific.  My boyfriend lived here for four years and has indicated to me that he's had nothing but problems with the management.  They hide behind the corporate facade and don't really care about the tenant or anyone for that matter.  Very unhelpful not to mention the price of the rent is very high for what you get.  They put a water regulator on the shower which allowed for no water pressure when showering.  Plus they put a paint type coating product on the tub which never allowed for it to get clean.  They also required to come into the property and install efficiency lightbulbs which emitted NO light.  The location is about the only thing positive about this place.  Worst management ever.

Good char grilled burger and onion rings we're better than expected.   $4 Bloody Mary's on Sat & Sun and they weren't bad.  Liked the condiment bar.  Good casual Burger joint that serves cocktails.

I really wanted to like this place, but I just went there and it was horrible!  It was dirty and the food basically sucked.  We had the Taco and Enchilada combo and 2 tacos.  I took 2 bites and could finish.  The Enchilada was soggy and flavor was worse than put of a can.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, unfortunately.  Super disappointed.

A group of us took our artist friend for his birthday last night.   It was the third time I'd been there with the first two times being pretty decent experiences, but this time I was very disappointed, as were the majority of our table mates.  First off, plan on spending a small fortune for substandard meals.  I don't know if the chef that night was having a bad day, but here's the rundown.....we ordered 4-appetizers, the wild boar, pork belly, tuna and artisian cheese plate....I'd say they were "meh."  For the entree, I ordered today's fish which was a light whitefish.  It was bland, not cooked properly and very underwhelming.  My boyfriend got the sirloin and it was dry and almost inedible.  He said "the worst steak he's ever had was better than that one."  The cut was bad and the sides were a joke.  Our birthday guest ordered the lamb, he requested it be prepared "medium" it was "very rare" - they did take the lamb off the bill as it was THAT bad.  Friend of ours ordered the black bean "meatloaf" I had a bite it was dry and not that flavorful.  Service slid off after the main course as the server was hit or miss.  Most of the time if we needed something, we were telling our bus boy as he was more attentive than the server.  Our table for 8 was crammed in a room with a table for 4 and table for 2, it was so loud in there you couldn't even carry on a conversation.  Not to mention we were so tightly packed in, you had to do the "walk sideways and suck in your gut manoeuvre" to squeeze between the tables if you had to get up from the table for any reason.  I chose this place because I thought it would be a nice special occasion place in Tempe for our dear friend.  He didn't enjoy it, we spent way too much money for disappointing food, service and table setup and we will likely never go there again.  I would not recommend House of Tricks in fact, I'll likely be telling people about our experience to steer them away from here.  I knew we should've went to Caff√® Boa instead.

Tried this place as we live near here.  I'm a Pozole connessueir and addict, so naturally, I ordered the Pozole.  It was not good.  I would say of all the Pozoles I've ever had, this is last on the list, it was bland, not spicy, no condiments or tortilla. Here is my list of top 3 best Pozoles in order: 1. Arribas 2. Richardsons 3. Barrio Urbano

I've used Jeannie's Grooming since 2006.  They're very trustworthy and reasonably priced.  Jeannie's so nice and has helped animal rescues with donations in the past.

Ranks in top 5 of pizza places I've been to.  Their Stomboli was delish, as was the pizza.  We had delivery and it was timely.  I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.

I've been to a lot of nail salons, this one by far is one of my faves.  Been coming here 4 months.  They are fast and my nails always look great and last a long time.  You can only tip in cash.

I just took my 4-cats to Second Home Pet Resort for a one-day boarding and I couldn't be happier with the service and care that my cats received.  In light of what happened with dogs dying last year at a so-called "pet boarding facility" in Gilbert, AZ, I am even MORE careful and picky about where my pets are boarded.  I would recommend Second Home Pet Resort to anyone looking for a high quality, excellent service, reasonably priced facility to board their pets.  Whether it's for a day-boarding or long-term vacation, this is the ONLY pet boarding facility in Phoenix that I trust.  They have web-cam options, feeding options, grooming options, you name it, they have it.  I feel so comfortable knowing my pets are in the hands of caring people that I trust.  Don't put your pets comfort, safety and well being at risk by staying somewhere else....look no further than this place for your pet's care.

One of the Best if not THE BEST places in the Valley to have Pho.  #15 Chicken Pho is my favorite.  I don't go out to eat for lunch with my co-workers often, but when I do, I always vote for coming here.  The staff is friendly and the service is great.  The food is the icing on the cake and it's superb!  I highly recommend this place, it's Yummy!

Best Bloody Mary Bar.  The Oyster Po Boy is excellent.  The Matador breakfast is also quite tasty.  Great drink selection, love the ambiance.

This is the worst nail salon I've ever been to.  The techs are amateur and the male tech that did my pedicure was so lame, by day 2 after my pedi my toes looked awful!  I don't recommend this place at all!

Came here to celebrate my birthday dinner.  The ambiance was ok....with lots of lively activity over at the Yard with the games, almost too loud.  The service was less than spectacular.  The host answered the phone right when we walked up and it was very awkward.  The waiters were nice but just not as attentive as they should have been.  I will say it was the best Pozole I've ever had and I'm a Pozole connoisseur.  My entree, the Steak and egss were OK.  The OG Margaritas were great too.
