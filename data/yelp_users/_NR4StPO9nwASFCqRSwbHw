I went for an oil change.  I got the highest upgraded car cleaning package with leather conditioning.  I asked if it included interior cleaning and he assured me it did.  My car had not been wiped down at ALL when I got it back.  I complained to the manager that said it wasn't included but he would send it over to detail if I wanted to wait and would tip them.  I agreed.  They wiped it down a bit but it was still a mess and even the exterior of my car was full of marks that didn't get cleaned properly.  I never mind paying for things,  I DO mind wasting my time and money and not getting what was promised after sitting in a place for an hour and a half.  Not a repeat cutover, I wish I listened to all the Yelp reviews.  Frustrated.

I have been going to Ashley's for years now and I tell all my friends to try her out.  I get lash fill AND nails done at the SAME time!! As a busy mother with a career I cannot tell you how much I appreciate being able to do both at once.  Colleen and Ashley do an amazing job as well as the other staff.  I haven't had a bad experience yet.
