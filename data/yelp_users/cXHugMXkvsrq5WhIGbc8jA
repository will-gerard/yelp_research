If I could leave less than one star I would. This place was very unclean. I waited for 15 minutes with the menu and no one came by to take the order.there were only, maybe five people in the entire restaurant.  All I heard we're wait staff arguing with the kitchen, complaining how they wanted to go home. Really professional.   IHOP used to be pretty decent. No more.

A place for REAL people, not snobs or Scottsdale thousandairs.  Simply put, some of the best fish & chips I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Fish is fluffy and batter is CRISP and golden.  Steak fries are perfectly fried and not greasy.  The cole slaw is incredible too.  Other fare is quite nice and tasty as well.  The "Dragon Wings" are wonderful and a nice snack to go along with all the various beers on tap.  It's dark, sometimes loud. I like to go on an off night when I need a more subdued atmosphere.  This is NOT a corporate type bar & restaurant.  Once you know and understand that, you will be very happy.  No pretentious attitudes abide.  The only reason I do not give the G&D 5 stars is that the service can be a little inconsistent, but goes with the territory.  All in all it's a great place with terrific food and drink.  Just the way intended for a REAL pub.  Valerie is a great BTW and one of the most consistent staff.

Update to the earlier review: while the food is still fairly decent, the service has suffered quite a bit. Not only this visit, several past visits. Servers too busy chatting, hiding, you name it. Bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks. Did I mention there were only 10 patrons. Pretty slow for Saturday evening. May get slower I predict.   Seems like management is non existent. Too bad. Supported this place quite a lot during the light rail construction. Show some love GD.

Well, tied and last try with this establishment. I understand "Bar Rescue" did a show here. Sad thing is the service is worse than before.   Ordered a Balvenie 12 year old with a splash of water. Waitress brought out a drink with water and ice. When I mentioned it wasn't what I ordered, she looked at me in disbelief. She really though Scotch comes on the rocks by default.  Really doesn't matter. I'm not coming back. damn shame.

This store needs to get with the 21st century. No online ability to take money. Won't take credit cards over the phone. Won't take American Express. Cutting themselves out of a big market.  For local purchases with better customer service and convenience I prefer Tempe Camera Repair. They at least choose to accomodate customers.  Don't know how this store stays in business.

Well, I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews, but I guess I never will.  King Solomon's Pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game I absolutely cannot stand.  I ordered my pizza over the phone. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said "Don't you need my name and number?". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in.  So, I drive over to pick up my pizza.  I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter.  I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?  So I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.  Nice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.  Apparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay. This same technique was used on me before a Chinese restaurant in west Phoenix.   Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, screw you!

Long and short of it. Service was awful. Friendly enough staff, unfortunately very slow to respond, forgetful and not well informed of menu details. Seemed like a very green staff.  I really liked the ambience of Houston's, busy, but not loud. It had a great vibe and a nice synergy with Merc Bar across from them. Hilstone, while nicely designed for appearance was incredibly loud.  Tables seemed smaller and more tightly packed.  You could hear everyone's conversations around you.  Food was great.  Really enjoyed the sushi.  The Hawaiian Rib-eye was however tough. Ribs were great as usual.  Another issue was the check was short by $100 when it arrived.  They forgot to add what we drank and ate on the patio.  Took over 15 minutes to get it cleared up.  This place must be under new management and wait staff.  I didn't recognize anyone from the old Houston's staff.  Seems way too corporate in mentality like Applebee's or Chili's.  The only reason to go there is for the food, but for some of us that's just not enough.  I really hope they can turn this place around.

Been going here since the late 80s. A family run establishment, creating some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.  From the toasted sesame rolls to the pickles and peppers, it's all about the details. My personal favorite is the Super Sicilian. Incredible!  Notable: The offer beer

Been coming here for years. Seems like the past two have seen this location in decline.   Slowest drive thru of any McD's I've been to. Consistently slow service, inside as well. McDonald's usually has the best Coca-Cola, save this location. The mix is way off. Too much syrup.  You can do better.

Did I mention the slowest drive-thru? Yeah.   This particular franchise appears to have really poor management. Also seems to be understaffed.

Be sure to have the mechanics address everything on your list related to the quote you receive.  I brought my truck in for two issues.  One was resolved, but gained another problem which to their credit, they admitted screwing up and is now being fixed.  The other problem wasn't fully addressed and now will take more money to fix. Their response to me asking why it wasn't taken care of in the original quote was to say that "it should take care of the problem". They even changed their story about the diagnostics from what they told me the day before.  Told them I wasn't happy and was told I should be very happy as they saved me a lot of money. I'll acknowledge what they did to save me from having to get a new manifold was appreciated, but don't tell me you are going to fix the problems and then come back later and say they "should" be fixed when they aren't.  Sorry, but I will go back to Airpark Auto Service.  It's worth the 15 mile trip.  No shades of grey and definitely more confident about fixing a problem.  Sorry Cactus, but I won't be coming back.

This is an update to my earlier review. I happened to check my oil today and thank God I did.  4 QUARTS LOW!  Only three things are possible. 1. Oil leak  2. Oil burning  3. Insufficient amount of oil was put back into my truck after putting the engine back together. I'll give you a hint which two problems it isn't.  BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY.

I've been coming to Little Saigon for almost 20 years. In that time I have experienced several other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, but consider only one the best - Little Saigon.  The place: A family run business located in a quaint, converted house that has a great vibe. Lots of warm feeling wood and decorated with traditional Vietnamese art and items. This is the only Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that cares about it's appearance as much as the food. The bathrooms are very nice and clean. Other Viet restaurants are usually found in strip malls, having all the ambience of going to the DMV.   The staff: Always friendly and attentive, especially John and his wife. John's dad is usually in the kitchen making the fantastic food that has kept me going back for years. If you ever need guidance through the extensive menu or need help on what to order, John will hook you up.  The food: Now let's talk about the best part of Little Saigon, the food. From the Pho to the Bun and clay pots, Little Saigon has it where it counts.  Fresh herbs and vegetables (nothing canned) and tender meats make it a great experience.  My personal favorite are the Bun bowls (Rice noodle salad).  The meats are marinated and gilled, having lots of flavor.  Noodles are done to perfection and the lettuce greens and herbs are always fresh.  The Pho (soups) are the perfect thing for a cool day and even in the summer. Flavorful broth with noodles, beef slices or meatballs (yes, meatballs) and more of those great herbs like mint and cilantro. Yum!  My wife is a fan of the clay pots for the slightly more intense flavors found with these meals. I enjoy them as well.  The beer I prefer to drink with my meals is the Vietnamese "33 Export" they serve. Similar to Tsing Tao, but seems to have a little more kick, ;)  If you are trying Vietnamese food for the fist time, I highly recommend Little Saigon.   You won't be disappointed and probably will get hooked like I did years ago.

From the poorly stocked shelves to the apathetic staff. Yeah, about the staff - it's OK to acknowledge the customer when they thank you. Staring at them doesn't cut it. Also talking ( let's be frank, BS-ing) with other employees when there is a line waiting for cashier assistance at self-checkout is not cool either.  It might be a good policy for staff to leave cell phone in the locker while working. Seen the cart collectors jabbering away. Maybe this is why there never seems to be carts on-hand. I have noticed of late is that nobody seems to collect carts on a regular basis. When I was a teen and worked grocery, it was very important that carts be collected and available. Speaking of carts, they may wish to repair them as at least a third have locked wheels.  What can you say? This store is poorly managed. They need to train staff better too. I have been going to this location for years, but find myself driving further and spending more to have a better shopping experience. That goes for the quality of produce as well.  The skeevy customers don't seem to help. Opened products and people making themselves at home in the lawn chair area is a big turn off. Be sure to check the packaging for being tampered with, especially the beer. Walked out one time with a six pack of bottles that had a few nips taken out of three of them. Absolutely gross.  Hate to sound like some old man ranting, but I really just need to go elsewhere.

Dr. Carson was extremely attentive and professional in his listening and treatment of my molar that needed to be re-crowned.  I am ecstatic with the results! The crown fits like a glove and is indeed stable and perfect.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this wonderful restaurant sooner. Hana is by far the BEST Japanese food experience I have had.  The Why: Fresh, clean, and best selected fish in the state, as far as I am concerned. This is the place for sashimi & nigiri. Rolls are good too, but it's the select fish that catapults this restaurant into the stratosphere. Be sure and try the fresh oysters. INCREDIBLE!  The How: Family run by those who know seafood and how to put it all together.  The Where: Centrally located in Phoenix at 7th Ave. & Missouri.  Be sure to get there early as you may have a wait, but it's totally worth it. This place is a destination for the discerning sushi patron. BYOB.

Fantastic burger. Fresh fixings on sesame seed buns. Great flavor and friendly service provided by a small family run business. These burgers beat Smashburger, Five Guys and The Habit, hands down.  At indoors or run through the drive-thru. Fast service. Really like this place. Real old fashioned feel and what diner burgers used to taste like.

Slow........ Service.   Food has really taken a turn for the worse. I'd rather eat a McDonald's breakfast. At least it's consistent.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Didn't realize they changed it up. The sauce was a tasteless cream concoction. I knew I was in trouble when the server asked how I like my eggs. Runny yolks, firm whites. I got a tennis ball of hard egg. What they serve as EB is nothing like it should be.  This place is a train wreck. Be warned.

I found the staff to be hurried and not wanting to take the time to listen. Dr. Darson's physician's assistant was extremely apathetic and rough. Disregarded my pain.  While my experience with the doctor himself was not negative during the visit, the follow up, especially in addressing my pain was nil. Also he seems very busy and hurried.  I will be looking for a new doctor.

The building was originally a Mexican fast-food restaurant.  I assumed it would be the same sort of fast-food barbecue fare.  I was surprised and sort of puzzled that it had wait staff and was a sit-down dining place as well as drive through.  kind of a strange mix and probably not a good fit for being next to a McDonald's.  First, let me say the place was very clean and presentable. The yellow filtered lighting was pretty hard on the eyes. The tiny type was illegible in sections on the small, photo copied menus.  The service was OK, but a little slow about refreshing your drinks. The server was nice, but harried.  The food was the worst part.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad, as they ran out of fries to the owner's dismay. He was informed by overhearing the waiter tell me.  Looks like a little communication problem going on between staff and management.  Back to the food... The pork was kind of dry and extremely smokey, like it was in a house fire. The sauce was pretty spicy and along with the over smoked pork was really harsh. The potato salad was also spicy (there seems to be a theme here) and quite salty. I decided not to eat it all, as I didn't want my extremities swelling up.  Price wise it's on par with a sit-down restaurant. However, for the fast food surroundings - it's a bit over priced.  Overall I would say I probably won't be back.

I had thought about not even doing a review because I wanted to keep this jewel all to myself. However, I cannot deny Matthew his due. This was an incredible barbershop experience.  From the moment you walk in and see how is done up with all the vintage wall hangings, old time radio, barbershop artifacts and old and new movies playing, you are transported to a more simple era. His goal was to create a man-cave and he sure did. Great waiting area with super comfy chairs too. The aroma of the old style aftershaves lightly linger in the air, like a relaxing aroma from a happy memory.  The hair cut was perfect. Matthew truly listens and has his own suggestions. This guy was meant to do what he's doing and the love of it shows in his great skill and personable way. The aftershaves are really intoxicating like the one I chose, champagne. ;)  Call before to see if there is a wait, although you may not mind as the waiting room is so relaxing. Cash is king, no credit cards.  I will paraphrase Borgart in Casablanca, "Matthew, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."

Originally nobody was answering the phone at this location and I gave a poor review. Found out it was the service provider. After visiting the location, Matt provided great service. I love my new Van's.  I need to remember not to jump to conclusions.

I have to say I was blown away with the food served. The bruschetta was incredible and not over spiced with garlic. If it was there, it was really smooth. The grape tomatoes were a different thing for me and I loved it.   The pizza we enjoyed was the POMO: Italian Sausage, Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Mushrooms. It was fantastic! Thin crust, yet the flavor of the bread was present and complimented the tasty toppings.  If you can, get a seat at the bar by the oven. Not hot at all and you get to see the process. It's like dinner and a show!  To end the meal, have a generous slice of tiramisu. Perfect amount of ooz, if ya know what I mean.  I don't want to forget, the owner/mgr I believe, comes out with an unexpected bonus shot of homemade limoncello and honey drizzled pastry bits. My God it was heavenly.   I love, just love this place.

Really love the attention shown to clients, making them feel at-ease. His sense of humor and easygoing attitude really bring out the subject's inner beauty and confidence. It makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable experience.  Brad not only connects with the subject, his eye for light and the small details is fantastic. Aesthetically, his work is pleasing and compliments the model, rather than having the model try to conform to a cookie cutter template.  Even though his modesty will not allow him to agree, his work is custom and well thought out.  He's quite genuine and his passion shows in all his work.
