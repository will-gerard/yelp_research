I like this place. Huge menu, everything I've had has been good and the price is right.  Ok, I gotta qualify this...I haven't really gotten past the Rolled Tacos Supreme. It's just too good. Five taquitos blanketed in guacamole, lettuce, crema. cotija cheese and ganished with chopped carne asada....I want to try the rest of the menu, I really do, but when I get to the head of the line something takes over my vocal cords and I hear those three little words come out, again. J. likes the Nachos which is similar in ingredients to my fav with more carne asada and beans and he has had the fish tacos which he thought were very satisfactory.  Even though I've been able to resist so far, they have a good selection of Jarritos. Unfortunately the Jarritos Piña goes straight to my hips (like the entrees are calorie free???) so I prefer water or Ice Tea with my meals, but they are lovely to look at in the chiller next to the register.  This little taco shack has all the elements of a cheap Mexican delight. Variety, Flavor and good value for your buck. Look for me when you try it out, I'll probably be there ;-)

We drove by this place forever and kept saying, hmmm, wonder if it is any good...it is! We love the steak burrito and the Jamaica is sooo good. Haven't had a burrito I haven't liked yet, only wish they had some indoor seating.  Mucho Bueño!

Shortly after I wrote this review on Wildflower I got a personal message from the OWNER of the company thanking me and assuring me that the service I recently got is the standard now. I couldn't believe how fast he responded and am very impressed. Really appreciated how responsive Louis was and will gladly go back time and time again.  Louis and Wildflower rocks!

We went in again and this time on what I have to consider one of their busiest times, Sunday mid morning for brunch. The service was fast and flawless!  Wildflower and Louis you convinced me! 5 stars!

Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks!   Some of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.  He handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.  Kudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????

Cheap-cheap eats. Yes! $4.95, 2 very generous toppings on 2 humongous size slices and a soft drink. My new favorite pizza place even if it is 7 miles away.  Took a look at the menu and they're prices are extremely reasonable for a freshly baked for you pizza, too.  Love it.

Einstein Bros., I want to love you...I really do...you are making it soooo damn hard.  I have to interject here that, like the review before me, this applies to one location only (mostly).  You're convenient, really close to home and the coffee is really good. The bagels are good..they really are. So why do you have to cheap out on the amount of  ingredients in the sandwiches? Are you not making enough profit??? Come on, now...  I kinda stopped coming here a while ago because at $5.49 for a Nova Lox and Bagel I kind of want to at least have the bagel moistened with cream cheese  and have a couple more chips of lox on there with the 3 or 4 capers that garnish it. Ok, I might be over exaggerating a bit, but really, they go rather thin at this location. So I stopped coming here and would go to Desert Ridge to get my occasional fix.  Fast forward to present. Got a bunch of coupons in the newspaper and decided to give it a second chance, so have come here 3 times in the past week. Here are my experiences (note that experience #1 is going to be corporate, across the board and has nothing to do with quantity and everything to do with design and marketing):  1. Came in with coupon for new bagel poppers and coffee to enjoy on business road trip to Sedona. Poppers are featured in a cup with a lid leading one to believe they are an easy to eat finger food. DON"T BE FOOLED! The cream cheese poppers have a coating on them so slick that when you grab one between two fingers in explodes from your hand and projectiles into your windshield where it sticks and slowly slides off. Ok, not really, but seriously, I couldn't get them out of the cup, they kept slipping out of my fingers. I bought their self named car cup to only find out that it didn't fit in my cup holder and the first gentle turn I made out of the mall had the cup in my lap and me dancing in a seat of hot coffee. Add to that the aggravation that the guy taking the order wasn't sure how to ring it up because I got the car cup and....  #2  This actually went ok. Second coupon and things went smoothly, coffee good, bagel fresh and while cream cheese was a little thinner than what I like was adequate.  #3  Now today....ohhhh, today. I was ravenous...ate too lightly for dinner last night and didn't make it out of the house for breakfast until almost 10am. So, today's coupon is buy one bagel, get one free. Never thought about how much that schmear of cream cheese was until I had to actually look at the menu...$1.50, ok, times two bagels, 3 bucks, well, ok. Asked to have my two bagels toasted with cream cheese. First they come to me and inform me that they were out of one of my bagels. Ok. Then, when my order is called up the guy doing so makes fun of my name (my nickname is 'Cia, most think it very pretty, but it kind of loses its charm when the guy behind the counter yells out "Cia! [snicker] C-I-A!). Went to pick up the bagels and the cream cheese was scraped on sooo thin it was almost none existent. Complained...got a dirty look from the guy that spelled my name and the guy that took my order "informed" me that if I wanted it thicker I needed to ask for "heavy" when I placed my order...yeah, dude, uhhhm, I just wanted to actually be able to SEE the cream cheese on the bagel before I ate it. And the punchline? Get back to my table and it turns out one of the bagels wasn't even toasted.  Einstein's...is it so hard to get it right? One out of three experiences in a week's time acceptable is, well, kind of unacceptable.

This is my favorite breakfast meeting place. The food is consistently good, the service I have had is outstanding and they offer free wi-fi. It is a great place to hold a meeting as well as sit quietly and get some work done.  I find that First Watch attracts customers of all ages and walks of life...it's part of what makes eating there enjoyable. The background music is normally jazz and the tv's are tuned to news, so it may be that it's an environment that attracts a more experienced sophisticated crowd, for me, it's my neighborhood place. The food is to my liking, the waitstaff treats me like family and I can surf the net. Just like my own kitchen with better food ;-)

It's been about 4 years since I initially raved about this location and this is the first time in probably 1-2 years since I last visited. While the food was close to what I remembered, the service was mediocre at best.  I was trying to remember just why I stopped going, I know a big part was that I found a place I liked even better, but on looking back I realized that I went looking elsewhere because the service gradually went down. I had  bonded with a couple of wait staff who eventually left and it was kind of never the same, so I left, too.  Which brings me to today. The morning started out well enough with a waitress who promptly took my order with a smile. But then my order was brought by someone else...I asked for salsa and watched as that waitress went into the kitchen and...started...talking...to...other employees. So I waited... and waited...and watched as she continued to talk with a couple of people who seemed to be more hanging around than working. I finally resigned  myself to using the hot sauce on the table. Now, I want to be fair here, I was alone and when you are the only one at the table the food goes fast. I was 3/4 done with my meal when the original waitress came by to see 'how my food was tasting'. Told her the meal itself was fine but she should know about the salsa incident. She then cryptically said she would find out who it was and left. A few moments later the other waitress came by and apologized for forgetting and wanted to know if I still wanted the salsa without looking at the now empty except for the muffin plate. No thanks.  So, is that enough to spur me to knock down my initial review? Shouldn't be except for one other minor point. We're in the desert with record heat this week and my water glass was never refilled, no one came by and even offered, in fact the check just kind of showed up at the table. Again, the restaurant was busy enough that this could have been an oversight but employees were standing around. In fact, when I went to pay the check, the Manager was hanging out with two of the waitstaff up front and the little bit of conversation I heard didn't sound work related to me.  It is so very rare that I skip out on the tip, but my feeling is that when the bill is almost twelve bucks, I could at least be offered a second glass of water. Tipping is a reflection of the service rendered and I wasn't feeliing to good about that service by the end of the meal.

One of my big pet peeves is when people review restaurants and bitch about how dingy, etc. it is before talking about what's really important.  the food. After all, you can see what you are getting into from the parking lot and ya still went in!!!!!  My pet name for places like Los Cerritos is 'El Divo', pronounced with a loooong 'i', and one of the things you can usually count on from little dives is great food. Los Cerritos doesn't disappoint. We pulled into the drive-thru yesterday morning, ordered breakfast and were treated to cheesy melty goodness wrapped up in fresh flour tortillas. My Bacon-Egg-Cheese Burrito had more bacon than anything else in it, a two fisted fattie just waiting to be crowned with green sauce. J's steak and egg burrito looked just as good. He asked me if I wanted a bite and with eyes glazed over I looked at him and said "naw, I'm doing just fine here on my own..." The dog drooled as we drove away, two hungry Mexican foodie fans quietly chewing their way to Nirvana.  P.S. that trip to Nirvana is available anytime thanks to the giant "OPEN 24 HOURS" sign you can see from a block away ;-)

REI, you had such a good thing going...why, oh why...  Sometimes an event lives great because it offers so much more than it intends. When it's a store putting it on for the sake of it's customers (and I'd like to think as a thank you for loyalty) it goes far beyond a vehicle for making a sale.  We have loved the Garage Sale that this location put on for so very long. We would get in line at 5am with the other die hards and laugh at the people waking up in their sleeping bags (while secretly wishing that we had the cojones to do the same since they were going to get the VERY best deals). A couple years running Krispy Kreme came across the street with boxes of donuts to cheer our early morning wait.  But it was the people that made it. We'd hang out in the early morning hours with other outdoor enthusiasts trading stories and secrets about local trails, lakes and camping sites.  ...and then, with nervous excitement we'd charge into the parking lot like mad men, snatching up sleeping bags and hiking shoes for pennies on the dollar, thanking the REI gods that we, the chosen few, the members, would have such an opportunity to feed our equipment cravings at unheard of prices.  Flash forward to yesterday...I evidently missed the memo that the "new and improved" garage sale was happening in the store, up in the clinic room. Clutching my 20% off coupon we made our way through the crowded parking lot, J. with visions of using it for a new bike seat while I ready to fight him for a chance to restock my hiking sock drawer at 20% savings. We walked in to signs advertising the garage sale and  a very long line of people waiting to go up stairs for their finds of the year. J. got in line and I went to hunt for new feet cushions. Several minutes later, he found me to let me know that he had to get out of line to get tickets for the sale, but was assured that it was a 30 minute wait and he was going to  the bike department until our numbers were called.  I was dubious...the line looked like it was for an E-ticket ride at Disneyland and the people in it weren't looking any happier than if it was 98º with screaming kids at said park. Long story short...it was 2 full hours before we were called to that upstairs secret clubhouse. Once there, we were told we had a very generous 10 minutes to shop...we picked up a few things. set them down in frustration when neither of us could get to the clothes and walked out of the store empty handed.  REI management, this is an epic fail in my opinion. You turned a wonderful community event into a vehicle to hold your members hostage in hopes of their making full price purchases while waiting for a disappointing chance to make the killer buy that we dreamed yearly about...and worse yet, you didn't even make the sale that we intended...you didn't sell the $53 bike seat, you didn't sell the $17.95 socks but you did manage to piss off a couple of members who have been on your roster for 25 years.  Sometimes a sales event is more than the sum of the profits or in this case the decluttering of the returns bin. Sometimes it's a way to show your customers the loyalty they've shown you... we heard repeatedly that this was much easier on the employees and management than the old parking lot sale. This was much harder on us as consumers and so unsatisfying to wait two hours for a 10 minute opportunity. The parking lot sale was  one day of chaos for the employees a couple times a year...is that too much to ask from a store that we've been loyal too for half our lives?

This place was Great! The man behind the counter was friendly and explained what each pastry was with each unpronounceable name. We got this double vanilla custard cream thing with a wonderful flaky top and the best deal going on a package of day old rolls that tasted fresh the next day. Fabulous and I am already trying to find an excuse to make the drive ack over.

We got there...there was a wait...it was so crowded that some people had to stand to eat their food and it was soooo damn worth it.  From the folk Mexican art depicting Santo and Freda Kahlo's uni-brow to the leather and rough wood La Condesa is as much a treat to the eyes as to the nose and mouth.  We are so used to fiery Tex-Mex here in Arizona that it is hard to believe that there is another side to good Mexican food....a delicacy of flavor that counts on subtle textures and refreshing herbs and vegetables to cool our palates and the heat of Southwest days.  I tried every one of the salsas available on Saturday and I can still taste the peanut salsa while I dream of the strawberry salsa (and the cilantro cream salsa and the chipotle...you get the picture).  We split the dogfish and carne asada tacos along with a mahi burrito and were too stuffed to make our way any farther down the menu, guaranteeing we'll be back for more.  Any complaints? Only the smallest of one....I actually prefer water to soft drinks with my meals and appreciate a reasonably sized cup (I promise I won't steal the Coke). I was given an 8oz styro cup filled with ice, necessitating several trips to the counter to ask for more. Totally rediculous since the soft drink dispenser is behind the counter and I couldn't rip them off if I wanted to ;-) ....and yet another styro cup waiting over a thousand years to biodegrade in a landfill.  La Condesa is what a good taqueria should be, just make sure to weedle a paper cup out of the cashier if you quieres agua.

Perk overshoots right past Perkiness and straight into impertinence...  So I hate to be the bearer of bad news when all the other reviews for this place are good, but honestly I had such an attrocious time that I have to balance the scales here a bit.  Perk is right down the street from me and has been open about 8 months. We finally tried it this morning. I am going to have a hard time being convinced to go back.  We started with high hopes that immediately got dashed at the door. Although the restaurant was about one third empty the hostess had a bit of hesitancy seating us and then put us at the one table directly in the traffic route to the bathroom. I asked to be seated citing the traffic and again she seemed hesitant as to where to put us (any of the other 10 or so empty tables would have been just fine) before seating us near the front door.  The waitress came promptly enough for our drink order. J. asked for water to start and I requested coffee.  She came back a few minutes later with 2 waters and no coffee, dropped them off very fast and took off, I assumed to grab the missing coffee...and then the wait began. I started on the water and was a little surprised that it had the distinctive Phoenix tap taste to it. After several minutes of watching the other diners get their coffee refilled J. finally and politely asked if his wife could get the coffee she ordered. The waitress responded with a very tart and sharp "sure" and the coffee I ordered upon walking in was served with our meal.  So, at this point I bet you are wondering about the meal...it's pretty hard to screw up bacon and eggs so that is what I usually order my first visit to a breakfast place (and I just plain like bacon and eggs). The plate arrived looking good with half the plate loaded with their signature rosemary potatoes and an english muffin. I opened my english muffin to find it warm but untoasted (yech) and sent it back...again, no apology or sympathy from the waitress, just that same smart "sure". As I was waiting I started on the potatoes to find that the rosemary was non existent and to be honest, at 9:30 in the morning tasted to me like they were cooked much earlier and kept warm. My english muffin at this point came back toasted so that I could enjoy that.  At no point did the waitress come back to offer to refill my coffee. Now I don't know about you, but I have certain expectations when I'm spending 10 bucks on breakfast. They're simple but consistent. Bring my coffee promptly. When a mistake is made, acknowledge it and make it right and especially if multiple mistakes, apologize. And, when all of that is not accomplished, don't try to upsell by offering a pancake for dessert.  This is truly a bummer because it is the closest real breakfast joint to my house and I was really wanting someone great to come in and earn my business....goodbye bycycling to Sunday morning goodness, I'll just continue to get in the car and drive farther for my Weekend morning fare.

I had such a fabulous time with my friends last night that I just have to tell you about it. My very good friend David Sheehy got a new gig. He is now the House Musician at The Grotto Cafe in Cave Creek. I'd wax poetic about Dave, most of you know how much I enjoy his music, it's the place I have to tell you about. It was the most ...enjoyable venue I have been to in a very long time. The food was great with such reasonable prices that I feel like I could hang there all weekend instead of a big night out. The staff so friendly and helpful, the patio one of the most beautiful I've seen in the area and the atmosphere inside is the kind of eclectic feel I adore. David is now playing Friday, Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons. If there was ever a time to check out his great music, this is it.  The Grotto is uniquely located in a consignment shop called The Red Truck Trading Company. I noticed that there is a review on here by a disgruntled consignment customer and I'd like to address that. I spent the evening sitting on a very comfortable dining chair that, had it with my decor, I would have come home with the set because I "test drove" it more so than in a normal furniture store. My husband felt the same way about the chairs AND the table we were at. So, Bob P., I have to tell you, you are getting a unique opportunity to have your consigned items marketed. I walk in and out of consignment stores all the time and the chair I was sitting on last night wouldn't even have crossed my radar, yet I found myself wondering if it would be worth refinishing to work in my home. Great way to market used furniture, but I stray.  Come to The Grotto Cafe, Come to hear my good friend David Sheehy sing and stay for the food, the ambience and funky decor.

I always have such mixed feelings when I have a restaurant experience like this...I wish there was a rating like, I dunno, 2.8. Because it wasn't a 3 for me, but I hate to go all the way down to a 2 on this.  I should love this restaurant. It's at an airport...I love airports. It's biking distance from my home...I love super close. It's a local business and God knows I love to support local businesses. It has great reviews on YELP and I really trust my Yelp buddies.  ...fast forward to my breakfast there today. We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess who immediately seated us next to the window where we could watch the planes and assured us that our waiter would be right with us. The restaurant was near empty at about 10:15 on Sunday morning.  Our server was with us immediately. For drinks we ordered two glasses of water and coffee for me. i asked if I might have a lime in my water and the waiter seemed distracted but said yes. And then we waited...and waited...and I joked that it was kind of funny that there were 10 reviews and the lowest was a 3 with a complaint about mediocre service.  Just when it got to the point that I was verbally questioning to J. if it was possible that the 9 stellar reviews could possibly be from friends and family our server showed up with our drink order. 2 miniscule (I believe an 8 oz. Libby style glass) glasses for water filled to the brim with ice and limes on the side, black coffee "oh, and I didn't know if you wanted these" half and half individuals.  At this point he asked to take our meal order. J. got the BLT and I got the basic 2 egg breakfast. I asked what breads there were for the toast option and told white, wheat and 9 grain. it seems like a restaurant that only does breakfast and lunch would have a slightly more varied option than wheat and upgraded wheat. How did I want my eggs? Basted. The waiter looked befuddled and then admitted he didn't know what that was. Again, a restaurant that serves egg dishes should have their wait staff trained well enough to not question a standard request and if they really don't know what it is tell the kitchen and then google it if it's still a problem. (just my humble opinion.)  Our drinks ran dry. We didn't see the waiter again until the meals were brought and he asked if there was anything else he could get us. I asked for refills on the drinks, butter and jam for my toast.  It took just long enough to refill the drinks that I was wondering if I would have to eat my meal dry. When he did bring them, I had to ask for more cream and remind him that I was still waiting for butter and jam. This was finally brought and the butter was frozen (a big pet peeve for me).  Now to be absolutely fair, the food was good. The only complaint I had about it was that it is standard to receive 2 slices of toast and I was served only one and it seemed to be near the end of the loaf as it was extremely small. J. said his sandwich was very good.  So here's my feeling on this place. When a restaurant goes into a location that is off the beaten track and that location has a track record of changing businesses (I believe this is the 3rd restaurant in this location in the 6 1/2 years I've lived near the airpark) then it places a very strong responsibility on the management to make it a WOW experience so that people come back time and time again.There was no WOW today, not even a fizzle and pfft.  I felt absolutely no incentive to come back and kind of feel bad that my trying it in the first place was based on the excited reviews here on Yelp. That was a first for me.  So how do I rate a restaurant that in theory has everything it needs to be successful but fizzles in practice? I really wanted to give this a 5...it turned upside down to a 2 for me...sorry.

I've always liked this store...now I love it.  We live in North Scottsdale, so this place is a good 25 miles away. It's Memorial Day Weekend and we are halfway to the store AND one of the biggest sales of the year when J. says to me, "you remembered the 20% off coupon, DIDN'T you???". Well, no, I have to admit I didn't and we got there to a store full of people and put our hands almost immediately on what we came for plus more.  Enter Mary...upon telling her that I forgot the coupon and thought we were going to spend the $100 minimum to qualify, she took the time on this very busy day to look up my membership number and coupon code, enabling us to save $20 on top of the great discounts they already had.  I think this is one of the best places to get outdoor clothing in the area...shop the Holiday sales and save enough to fill your tank in gas and get out to the great outdoors.
