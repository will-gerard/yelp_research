Dr. Dameron and his team are top notch, had a filling fall out and I was worried I would need a full crown and/or root canal. Dr. Dameron quickly diagnosed the situation and they were able to squeeze me in and I got the new filling put in completely pain free  in about an hour. Fixed up good as new! I would highly recommend Dr. Dameron for any of your dental needs

Steve at Spotless carpet care does a fantastic job, my carpets & large sectional look as good as new and I love the smell that is in the solution, really freshens up the house! I highly recommend Spotless Carpet Care

Steve and Andy at North Scottsdale Auto Service were extremely knowledgeable about my car & very helpful. I got a ding (curb rash) on one of my alloy wheels, and brought it to them to get fixed. Within a day they had the wheel looking like brand new. Highly recommend them, and I will be going back to get a SunTek clear Bra installed on my vehicle. Thanks so much for your great service and attention to detail!!

I have never been more disappointed in my life, my friends took me here for my Birthday and I had the Lasagna, I think I wouldve been better off going to Walgreens to grab a Stouffers, the staff is pretentious, rude...I would never in a million years spend a dime in this dump. Save your time and money, it sucks
