This was a great shop-super clean and fun...Great first impression overall.  Made an appointment early in the week with Jimmy. He was super friendly and made me feel super comfortable.   My friend and I went in last night to get our work done, Jimmy was super awesome and showed me some variety so I could see different options which I really appreciated! He was patient and listened well and executed EXACTLY what I wanted.   Will definitely be back...Thanks Jimmy!

ordered take out the other night. got home and only half my order was in the bag! :( thankfully I live super close and they were super nice and apologetic.   I am a regular and this never happens, therefore no big deal. the girls who work there are always so friendly!

I was in there this morning and the girls were very friendly! I spilt my smoothie all over and unfortunately didnt have time to wait for another one. But the other girl had already made me another one!  I left a happy customer! :D

Very disappointed. The front of the house was very unprofessional and not very accommodating. For the amount of money spent, I was not impressed by the food either.  All around, just a bad experience. Super disappointed because I was really looking forward to it...

my boyfriend recently went in to get a simple haircut and the woman completely messed it up...he did not ask for anything complicated and he came home with the most UNEVEN haircut of all time...he is too nice to say anything but I figured a yelp review was necessary.

Worst pedicure I have ever gotten...I have been there previously and never had any issues but today completely ruined it for me.  I get there and am told to sit in a chair (no water in the bowl) so my feet are in an empty thing...wierd. So finally they start my water and I sit there another 15 minutes. The woman proceeds to do my pedicure and it seemed like she was rushing through it...before I knew it she was painting my toes! NO MASSAGE!? I said "no massage"? and she completely ignored me! She then drains my bowl and walks away...  I was sitting there for a while then she comes and starts cleaning it while i was still sitting there (reaching under my legs)...awkard. I then had to put my own sandals on because she dissapeared.   All together a bad experience and one of my nails chipped already (2 hours later)   -_-

Went there for my first time last Sunday, and I was definitely impressed with how friendly the front desk was as well as the employees! They are very organized, clean, and friendly which made me feel very comfortable. I will definitely be back! :)

First off, the restaurant itself is gorgeous and has a great vibe. The location is also awesome.   Now for the hostess...did not have a great vibe...she seemed like she was super unhappy being there the entire time we were there. Maybe she was having a bad day?...  Our server was awesome for the time being...until he disappeared on our table with no warning. 20 minutes later a new server came to check on us and she was attentive.   The food was average, I ordered the rib eye with a loaded potato. The steak was ok but a little under seasoned and the potato was dry.   Over all, we left disappointed. It was not a consistent experience therefore I probably won't be returning.

Super annoyed.  My boyfriend and I (both under 21) have been there more than 3 times after 11 pm to eat and always had great service. This last Sunday we were sitting there at about 10:55 where we placed our order for an appetizer and drinks, then about 10 minutes later our waitress walked up and asked for our id's, to our unknown knowledge you had to be 21 after 11 pm. The manager then came over and explained to me the law and how other managers failed to enforce this, even though he was the only manager that we have ever seen there...awk.  So they then charged my boyfriend and I for our chips and salsa which we wouldnt have ordered if we would have known!?...the whole thing was annoying.

Brandon is awesome! He is super reliable and honest. He always does such a great job, I refer everyone I know since he does everything from cars to commercial tinting.

Every time I go I am hoping that I have a different experience. The last two times I have gone they are out of what I wanted and the staff is not friendly. And the few times before that were not much different.   Maybe I'll try again in a few months....

Literally......The best gelato ever. Service is always on point and everyone seems to really enjoy working there which always makes for good vibes in a place like Frost!   Good place to take the whole family!
