This is a very very long over due review.  Last Valentines day my husband and I did not make plans (he is an emergency doctor).  When he was able to come home early I was so excited, however I knew that every place would be booked.  We have been to La Torretta before, and Italian is my favorite.  I called and spoke to the one of the owners and he was SO nice.  I explained our situation, how it was impossible to make reservations in advance due to our situation and he was so kind on the phone.. told me not to worry, to come on in and he would make it work.  We arrived at the restaurant, had a lovely drink at the bar and waited for our table to be ready.  The food here is amazing and the service was impeccable.  I could not have asked for a nicer Valentines day dinner with my husband.  The restaurant is quaint and the decor is perfect.  If you are considering a restaurant in Scottsdale for Italian food, skip the big chains and go to this family operated restaurant.  They truly care about their customers and it shows!!!!!   Thank you!!!!!!!

Rude rude rude! Girl who took order doesn't look at you, yawns and eye rolls if you take more than a second. Guy who prepared food made one order incorrectly and it was an inconvenience for him to correct. Tables not being used are dirty- no napkins out. Ever since this place switched over I have yet to come here once with pleasant service and clean tables. Last time.

I don't often spit out food- and I rarely spit out chocolate, I spit out a cupcake from here! Who would have ever thought!!!? My husband came home with 4 beautifully decorated cupcakes...two for the kids and one for each of us, however only two flavors in the box. We gave one to each of our kids (the same or they would argue) and both of us also had the same flavor. I took one bite and immediately spit it out! Worst cupcake of my life! Even worse than what I could do- which is saying a lot! Even my hubby didn't eat his- he was also one bite and done. As for my kids? They ate a little bit of frosting off the top but that's it. The cup cakes couldn't even stand up, they fell over from frosting overload- which just made my boys upset...they are in pre-school, so they get emotional over their food. Won't be back!

This place is great. Service is excellent.  Delivery is fast.  They are kind and after only a few visits they knew us and we are now regulars.  Most importantly, the food is fantastic!

What can I say? THEY ARE WONDERFUL! We recently moved into a new house and the previous owners did not take care of their yard.  For a year we stuck with the landscapers who the previous owners used.  However, our grass was never green- was hard, and full of weeds.  Plants were overgrown and not trimmed properly, our yard was a mess! We saw a truck drive by and wrote down the number.  We called and spoke with Julian.  He came out to our home and pointed out so many issues with our grass that had not been previously addressed.  I wanted to make sure the grassy area in our yard was comfortable for my two boys to play on.  We first signed up to take care of the grass...and have it actually look like grass.  In just a matter of a few weeks it was green.  Now it is GORGEOUS! Not only did they help with the grass, but Julian truly knows what he is talking about.  He knows his plants so well, how to manage and to care for them.  We have replaced our old landscapers and now have Green Solutions taking care of our entire yard.  They are professional, nice, and arrive when they say they will.  Our yard is on its way to looking like the yard it deserves to be. We live on almost an acre, so there is a lot of work to do.  They are reasonably priced too.  We could not be any happier with the service we have received thus far.  Thank you Green Solutions-- for giving me the best view in the world... My boys playing in our gorgeously landscaped backyard...on green beautiful grass that I know my neighbors must be jealous of!

This place is a hidden gem! My husband and I found this place last Wednesday and tried it out for breakfast.  We each ordered a Mocha (DELICIOUS!) I ordered a custom omelette and my husband ordered Sausage egg and cheese croissant.  Everything was wonderful.  From the immediate greeting when we walked in the door to the fast service and excellent food.  We decided to come again today! It is nice to see an authentic family run cafe in this area.  This will be our new go to for our morning breakfast dates!

If I could give them Zero stars I would.  I am not sure who the franchise manager is, but I am certain they hires felons on parole.  Nothing is ever made correctly, the service is slow, and each time I have received my sandwich back I have to rebuild it.  I will never return to this location again.  Corporate should honestly monitor this location.
