Highly disappointed. First time here at the Phoenix location. Came in around 5pm after work. Decided to sit outside, because it was about 80 degrees out. Restaurant was not busy at all. Waiter greeted us nicely. Gave us a few mins to look over the menu. Waiter took our orders a few mins later. I order # 3 with watermelon Kool-Aid and my cousin ordered chicken strips. I wasn't too sure what was going on. It took 35 mins for our food to come out. That's unacceptable! At any restaurant. Especially if the restaurant isn't busy.  Timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice. It was not the waiter who took our order who checked on us. People came in after us got done eating  before we got our food. The wait time killed the whole experience. Couldn't enjoy the food like I wanted too. Overall I have to give this location 1 star.

Best pho place in town. Good people! If your not there for the pho try the bomb macaroons or  macaroon ice cream sandwiches.

Was craving Chinese food for dinner.  Found this place on yelp. It was a mixture of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food all under one roof. Checked in received free egg rolls. Ordered BBQ pork slices for appetizer is was delicious! Wasn't a fan of the wasabi mustard they had but the other dipping sauce was good. Server was nice, held a good conversation with us. Ordered three entree seafood pan fried noddles, Mongolia beef and Thai basil chicken. Each dish was full of flavors. Will be coming back soon to try other dishes.

I had high expectation for the hot pot, disappointed with the Thai Tom Yum Broth. This restaurant clearly name is Red Thai. The Tom Yum was nothing Thai about it. It was super sour, it tasted EXACTLY like sinigang (Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste most often associated with tamarind) if I wanted sinigang I would of asked my mother inlaw. I worked at a family owned Thai restaurant before the Tom yum broth was nothing near how it was suppose to taste like. I thought this was worst then a Vietnamese restaurant serving watered down chicken curry. PLEASE!!  invest in the time to perfect the Tom yum broth. It would of been more enjoyable if the broth tasted like it suppose too. Giving 2 stars for good service.
