Walked in the door right after 10 with the boyfriend to grab some food. They had karaoke going on in the main room, so we grabbed a booth in the bar area. I am not a yelper, really, but I work in the restaurant industry and I wish I had a chance to write something better. However, we sat down and not one person or employee greeted us for about 5-7 mins. We listened to 3 karaoke songs and nothing. Servers walked by us, sat in the well waiting for their drinks and still nothing. By far the worst way to start off. We looked around and finally were over it and walked right out. At least greet your tables!! Cmon I get it, I manage and bartend elsewhere. They were about half full too, so no excuse. Wish I had something better to say, but they weren't busy at all, just seemed to not care on a Saturday night.

I agree with the last review! "Not just for luxury cars, although that's their specialty" They repaired my 08 black nissan altima, after someone backed into my rear bumper back in may and then I rear ended someone about a month ago. So lets say my car was a diamond in the rough! No bumper, front end dunzo and i had paint peeling off bad on my roof and starting to on my hood and my trunk (posted pictures). Insurance took care of my front end damage, replacing my hood, lights and ect. They even painted the new headlight for me because I had them tinted before the accident. I took care of getting a new bumper and they painted my trunk and roof to match.  Lemme just say she came back looking like she did when i first got her! Shiny new diamond. Even waxed and detailed the car for me. The paint looks awesome, much thicker german paint than the paint nissan puts on originally. John sent me an update every week letting me know what they had done, what insurance was doing ect. It was there about a month, but most of that was due to my insurance having one adjuster for the state of AZ. They were great about everything! I dealt with john and JP, the owners son, who was referred to me by friends. It was easy and painless, they dealt directly with enterprise so no finding rides ect. I highly recommend them!

The staff there is awesome and super friendly. The owners Jo and myriam are super sweet and have had this family business forever! Their daughter Jess is also part of their amazing team. EXTENSIONS EXTENSIONS EXTENSIONs! I had my first pair put in by someone else and the woman ruined my hair, cut the extensions, cut my own hair so when they came out I had a bob. I was mortified. You can really tell a difference when someone enjoys doing extensions vs not. Went into Jo Paris three times since than for extensions and their team is great. Jess is great with hair and extensions because she is particular with placement and obsessed with extensions herself. So She takes her time and the end result is amazing! She is always putting in and taking out her own set, fine tuning her touch. I HIGHLY recommend going to her for extensions, she is always there if you need anything fixed ect. My hair was a little longer than shoulder length and I came out with 18s! My hair looked awesome, I will be a return customer forever. Thank you guys!!  Pictures posted!!  Pictures are of multiple visits through the last year and half. Putting in new sets of hair, moving them up every 4-5 months ect :) hair maintenance. My natural hair has never looked so healthy after this too!
