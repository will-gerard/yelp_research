This Costco is great. The parking lot can get crowded, but it is set up in a way that makes it easy to navigate. I also like how the gas area has very clear lines nd barriers so people aren't getting stuck going the wrong way and having lines clogging up the lanes.   On the inside it is your typical Costco. They have a pretty nice pharmacy and more pet supplies than some Costcos so i was pretty impressed by that. The staff are always super friendly and accommodating and like at any Costco you can return pretty much anything. Make sure if you want to eat in the food court area you bring cash or check because they don't take cards! My only complaint is that the tables by the eating area is always really dirty. They should have some team members come by and clean them once in a while.

I came here with pretty high expectations. I had heard great things about the pizza and was excited to try things out. The parking at this location is kind of annoying. There is a small lot behind the restaurant and other than that there is a neighborhood you can park in. but make sure you read the no parking signs to avoid getting any tickets.   We didn't call ahead or anything so we had to wit 40 minutes for a seat, but it was fine because we just sat at the bar. It was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday at 6:00. The staff were very friendly and accommodating though. When we were seated I ordered and appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms. We were informed that the deep dish pizza took 40 minutes to make and I wanted something to munch on. The appetizer was super yummy. The sausage was a little spicy for my taste, but still really good.   When our meal came out the pizza was definitely the best part. We got both thin crust and deep dish pizza and I enjoyed both. We got a pasta as well and I thought it was just meh. I wouldn't order it again. We got the cookie dough dessert which was also delicious. Overall the meal was super good, and the staff are really nice, but if you plan on coming (especially on a busy night) make sure you have a while to wait.

The guys that work at this place are super friendly. I work next door at so I come over occasionally for a sub. They have a deal that if you come after 4pm you get any foot long for $5. It's super cheap and a lot better than Subway. They actually slice the meat in front of you. The subs are still kinda mediocre, but for the price you can't beat it.

I got my pet's shots here and it was kind of a nightmare. The staff were really friendly and the people giving the shots were friendly, but the store was filthy and noisy. There was some sort of dog get together going on up front and there were dogs barking like cray the whoel time. It was very bad planning considering it was the same time that dogs, puppies, and KITTENS/CATS are going to be waiting around for a long time to get shots. I had my cat with me and he was terrified and the barking just continued. Plus I felt like my dog was just sitting in dirt the whole time because the floors were so disgusting. I probably won't return unless I need to get shots for my pets again.

I had no negative experiences with this clinics until today. I was trying to get a medication called in for my dog and it had been over 7 hours and they still haven't made the simple phone call to a cvs or even to me to check up on him or his medication. I'm so mad. He has been vomiting al day and can't control his bowels and these people can't call in a medication. A five minute phone call that could prevent my dog from being put on an IV due to dehydration.

I came here with some friends the other day and I was pretty skeptical because there was nobody in the restaurant, but i was pretty impressed. I got the Chicken Katsu and it was SO GOOD. Our food came out pretty quickly and the Mac was to die for! I always love Hawaiian BBQ and this might be my new go to place. I also got a mini and it was plenty of food for me. I think a regular sized meal might be enough for two people to share or to have leftovers for another meal!

This is a smaller Whole Foods. I normally only come here in a pinch. The best part of this location is definitely the juice bar. It is huge. At other Whole Foods the juice bar can be small and the menu can be a little limited. I give this location four stars because I love Whole Foods, but it is laid out a little funny and is kind of hard to navigate.

I will NEVER buy from Louis Vuitton after visiting this store. Their manager, Nancy, and all their sales associates are the rudest people I've ever encountered. They incorrectly charged my boyfriend's card $1,200 and wouldn't refund it; acting like we are the criminals when they were committing a class 5 felony. I can't believe they can sell so many purses while treating their customers like garbage.  I don't want to go into too much detail because it's a long story, but trust me it has been terrible. Don't ever buy from here.

I have come into this location before to have packages shipped and have had a mediocre experience. They simply helped me ship the item, the lines were kind of long, but what can you expect? It's in a busy area etc.   Tonight though I just left and a young man (didn't catch his name, he had gauges in his ears) went above and beyond to help me. I came in right before closing thinking I could print some posters off for my recital by myself and get in and out without bothering any employees. I frequently close at my place of work and know how annoying it is when people come in right at closing. I was unfamiliar with the technology at this location though and couldn't print off the posters. When I went to get help from the man at the counter he stayed almost 20 MINUTES after closing to print off my posters for me. And he wasn't rushing me or anything. He gave me different paper options etc. I can't believe how much he went out of his way to help me. I will definitely be calling his manager to tell them what a great employee they have.

I came here yesterday with some friends and it was just alright. It was your typical IHOP food. It is convenient because it is right next to ASU, but the parking lot looks kind of sketchy as does the inside of the building. It just looks a little run down. The food is al right. Nothing spectacular. The servers were very friendly and kept refilling our glasses, even when we were finished eating which is nice. It just wasn't anything I was super amazed about. I might come back if I want some quick, cheap pancakes, but there are just so many other good restaurants in Tempe I would probably pass.

I saw Shen Yun here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and the production was wonderful. All of the ushers were very helpful and nice. We sat on he upper balcony and were still able to see. It is a little scary because you are so high up and the chairs are so steep, but you can see just fine from all places in the venue. It is a beautiful venue from the outside and not to mention HUGE. The architecture, sound, and visual quality of this building leaves something everyone can enjoy.   The biggest nightmare about this venue is the parking. Sometimes if there is a popular production like Blue Man Group all of Mill Ave will be backed up and you will have to leave super early (this becomes a problem for music students who have class) and the parking attendants can be REALLY rude. Not to mention most of the people parking don't know how to navigate around the Gammage parking lot. It can get super frustrating. Also it would be nice if the meters were free after 7pm like the lot and not after 10pm so that patrons could park there and don't have to pay or worry about getting a parking ticket!

Came here a while ago for some dinner when I was craving some good Thai food. I was not disappointed. It was decently priced, and the portions were pretty big. I saw people leaving the back with take-out containers and getting into cars so I'm assuming that hey do delivery. The restaurant is very cute though if you want to go in. I wish I had taken pictures! They had some cheesy music playing, but I thought it was kind of funny. The food arrived and was excellent. The service was fast and the food had lots of flavor. I will definitely be back.

This place is SO GOOD. The food is all reasonably priced, especially for the portions you receive. I've never had the beer here, but the iced teas are very good. I've also had the soups, pasties, and the apple pasty dessert and have been extremely satisfied with all of them. I try to get a different pasty each time and haven't gotten a bad one! Some tend to be a bit lighter like the eggplant, or you can get a heartier one like the shepherd's pie.   All of the server's are very nice and helpful. If it's a Friday or Saturday night i would make sure to get there early or send someone ahead of your group because it can get a little crowded.

This dog park is AMAZING. I just started taking my little guy here a few weeks ago and have no complaints. It is a little bit out of the way for me, but it is so worth it. All of the dog owners are very attentive to their dogs and I have yet to see a dog fight. There is lots of space and the grass and trees look well tended to. I also like that you can come at any time of day and you are guaranteed to find other dogs here. It is always disappointing at other dog parks when I have to take my dog to the park at an odd hour of the day because of my work schedule and he has nobody to play with when we get there.   I would recommend bringing your own water bowls because there are lot of water fixtures but they aren't the greatest and since the park is so big they are kind of out of the way in the corner. People are usually nice and let you use their water bowls, but I feel bad.   I would recommend this park to anyone. Even if it is out of your way I would make the extra drive. It is by far THE BEST dog park I've been to.

Bought a Keurig here the other day for a friend of mine. It was such a good deal! The coffee machine was $30 off AND I was able to use my 20% off coupon on it. I love the coupons they send out and the variety of items you can use them on. The staff are very helpful and the store was clean and organized

This location is pretty small compared to other locations I've been to, but I was pretty impressed for the variety and size for a mall location. They had a lot of accessories for KitchenAid mixers (which is what I was looking for) as well as a lot of knick knacks for your kitchen. The items were very high quality and while some were a little pricey they had some that were very reasonably priced.  Their items are a good investment for your kitchen and will probably last a lifetime.   The staff are very helpful and will hold your items up from if you have something heavy and want to continue shopping. This is nice because it can be annoying having to walk around in a store (especially if it is crowded) with a huge pot in your hands.

I came in here with my service dog once and was publicly embarrassed when the manager came up to me and told me to wait outside. And no dogs were allowed. When I said he was a service dog and that he provides service for my PTSD she told me that law doesn't apply in Arizona. I didn't even know how to react. Under the American Disabilities Act (which is federal law) you are allowed to bring in a service dog to help with post traumatic stress disorder and employees are only allowed to ask if it is a service dog and what service it provides. My dog is trained, doesn't bark, doesn't pay attention to any people, and just sits by my side. I've never been kicked out of a restaurant or store before. They didn't even bring me my drink. I just sat outside and they left it inside where I was no longer able to go.

I have to say I was a little sketch about this place at first. From the outside it doesn't look that fantastic. I figured it was right across the street from my apartment complex so why not.   When I walked in I knew this place was good because I had to wait 45 minutes. I didn't really mind though. There were plenty of magazines, and I brought a book. When it was my turn I got the basic pedicure. The girl who did mine was very sweet and did an excellent job. They give you a hot rock massage which was something I never experienced while getting a pedicure. It felt really nice and was super relaxing.   I ended up coming back again and got the deluxe pedicure. (The second one up. I think it is called the deluxe) I again had a very positive experience and was happy with my pedicure. I have to say I was much more satisfied with this one and think it was worth the extra money. You get callus removal and a little extra cuticle treatment etc. It's always nice to get some extra pampering.

Sprinkle's cupcakes are definitely some of the best cupcake's I've ever eaten. They are a little bit pricey, but for me it is worth it. You can occasionally get one that is too sweet or just isn't that special, but if you find a flavor you like I suggest sticking with it. I recommend the red velvet and dark chocolate. SO GOOD. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because I've gone in there once or twice and received horrible service. normally the staff are really nice and enthusiastic, but every once in a while they are just standing around and don't greet you, or seem understaffed.

To be honest I wasn't too impressed with this place. I had not so high expectations because it wasn't too crowded and it looked like mediocre food, but I had heard the pizza was good. I got some avocado and chips starer and it as all right, but so expensive for how much food I received! I also got the pear pizza? can't remember the name... But it has a huge mound of salad on the top of it that wasn't even centered on the pizza. Granted it was pretty tasty, but it just looked awkward and was awkward to eat.   The worst part about the visit was that it was FREEZING in the booth we were sitting at . I know people in Arizona can go crazy with the AC, but this was just like I was caught in a wind tunnel. The service was great, but I was just so uncomfortable and wanted to get the heck out of there.

I was so excited to find out there was In-N-Out near by when I moved to Arizona. Being a California girl this is a major plus. Another major plus is that this location is amazing. My boyfriend and I tend to have very complicated orders and they have yet to mess them up. I also receive fast and friendly service from all of their staff members wether I'm going through the drive through or dining in.   Sometimes it looks very busy from the outside of the store, but they are still able to get your food to you fairly quickly. It gives you time to go to the bathroom, get your drink and find a seat, anyways.

The staff are very friendly and helpful, even late at night when you know they probably just want to go home. I feel like I come to this location all the time. I've also had to do some returns and it is always an easy process if I come with my Target card and receipt.  It is always well stocked with everything I need as well as clean and very easy to navigate. AND There are always good sales if you check the cartwheel app and come back regularly to check items. Love this location.

Came here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend. It was VERY crowded and we were sitting pretty close to the table next to us, but that is to be expected for Valentine's day. I was just happy to get a reservation! This place is pretty in demand for holidays. So I ordered the lobster bisque to start and then for my main course I got the Petit Filet 8oz and my boyfriend ordered the Pepper Steak 12oz. We also got the green beans, mashed potatoes, and gouda mac and cheese and the butter cake for dessert. Let me start by saying we got waaay too much food. The food here is very filling.   The lobster bisque was one of the best I've had. It had whole lobster in it and the stock was very creamy. I ordered my meat rare and it was sooo good. They didn't overcook it and the meat was so tender and juicy. All the sides were seasoned perfectly even though it was very crowded for Valentine's day.   Then dessert came. We were pretty full but we felt like we HAD to try the butter cake. BELIEVE ME IT IS WORTH IT! It was so moist and delicious. Topped with delicious berries. yumm. The dinner was pricey, but it was definitely a night I won't forget.

I come to this PetSmart all the time with my dog. He absolutely loves it here. The sales associates are always very nice to him and give him treats at the counter when we check out. their selection is not the best compared to other PetSmarts I've seen and their shelves can sometimes be a bit sparce. I like the Martha Stewart collection items they carry, but some of the other stuff can be rubbish.   Another thing I've had a problem with here is that it is hard to find natural pet treats and food here. I couldn't find one treat that just had meat in it...They all had some sort of preservative or filler. I guess that is a corporate call and not this individual location's fault. I've recently discovered the Zuke's treats that are made in the USA and are better for your pets, but just go elsewhere for chews etc as I kinda don't trust them.   For toys, clothes, collars, leashes, etc. this is a perfect place to go. It also makes for a fun outing for you and your furry friend. If you are looking for something healthy for your dog I would try somewhere else.

Drove twenty minutes out of my way to get some vegan food at this whole foods. I went away empty handed because some manager in prepared foods came up and asked for certification for my service dog. You should teach your employees that you are not allowed to ask for certification under the American disabilities act. You are allowed to ask if the dog is a service dog and what service that dog provides. I informed the manager of this and he said that "just so you know we have a sign that says only service dogs are allowed so if he's not a service dog you need to go" As someone with PTSD and severe anxiety I was mortified and left empty handed. The man was watching me in the store and standing at the door while I left. It made me feel really creeped out and uneasy. I will probably never return to this location. I Thanks for the public humiliation tonight.  I called back to complain and the manager sounded very unapologetic. I'm now sitting at home on the verge of an anxiety attack. Probably will have to call into work tomorrow. Thanks guys.

I had moved to Arizona in August and my Pomeranian's fur had started shedding very unevenly to adjust to the Arizona weather. His long hair on the top of his back all fell out while the hair on his sides continued to grow making him look as if he had a mullet. haha I hadn't found a groomer and Arizona yet and had just been bathing and brushing him myself.   I brought my Pomeranian in for the first time yesterday for a groom. I had been in before to do some shopping, but had never used their grooming services. After observing many customers leaving satisfied I decided to bring in my baby for a bath and trim. He looked so adorable afterwards! His fur was all even and they had brushed and shampooed him so well. It was the cleanest I've felt him since he's been a puppy.   The only reason I'm giving four stars was that he was back in the play area for a while and I don't think he had any water. Though I was late picking him up, (totally my fault) when I picked him up he ran to the store's water bowl and gulped it all down. He also had to go to the bathroom very badly, but again I was late picking him up so that was my fault.   All in all I was very satisfied with their services and will be back again!

I would leave zero stars if I could. Where do I begin. I used to love going to this dg park when I first moved here. I have an 8 lb Pomeranian, so I was a bit apprehensive about the park being mixed between all dogs, but he is quite feisty so I knew he could hold his own. After a few weeks of coming here I noticed he didn't play quite as much sometimes as he did at other parks. He seemed a bit timid around the other dogs, which is NOT his personality. And it was because there was so much tension between lots of the dogs here. I could even feel it.   The biggest reason I no longer come here though is because people here do not watch their dogs. I've seen so many dog fights and watched people do nothing. They just watch as their dogs repeatedly attack and get into scuffles with multiple other dogs. Obviously your dog needs to take a breather for a bit so take it aside and let it calm down! The last time I came here literally every dog in the park except for mine, a few other little ones, and a husky got involved in a huge brawl that left some bleeding. AND NOBODY TRIED TO BREAK UP THE FIGHT. Finally the owner of the husky ran over and did something. It scared me and my pom so much that I never took him back. I'd rather drive an extra 15 minutes to Chaparral than have my dog end up in stitches or worse.

I love Yogurtland, and this location is pretty good. They have lots of flavors and toppings. It can get crowded at night and they seem to run out of some flavors which can be sort of annoying. If you use your frequent buyer card or whatever though you can get your froyo for a super good price.

The food here is very good. I've gotten take out and eaten in the restaurant and both experiences have been enjoyable. The service in the restaurant is great. I have no idea what the people are talking about when they say the servers are bad. Ours was very kind and had lots of conversation with my boyfriend and me. He also gave us some extra food to try some stuff out! We have gotten the dinner for two both times and it has been more than enough food, especially for the price. It looks kind of like a dump from the outside, but the food is actually really good!  For the take out food we called and they said it would only take about 20 minutes to cook our food. My boyfriend showed up 20 minutes later and our food was ready to go. It was all wrapped up and warm. There was no problems at all and we had just as much food, is not more, than when we dined in.

Needed to do a return here today. Their return policy is excellent and their staff were very friendly. I had no receipt and the item was used so I know it probably looked a little sketchy, but the item was a gift. Regardless, they were very helpful and did the exchange. I purchased some Yankee candles and accessories because I'm a bit of a candle freak. I don't think the candles were any more expensive then they would be at any other Yankee store, plus they had some great deals on them (Clearance etc.) They just seemed understaffed at the front register.

Just moved in here the other day and so far I haven't been pleased. I walked into my apartment and it REEKED of cigarettes. I'm not a smoker so I was not happy about it. I also went into the closet and was shocked to see two whole patches of carpet were missing. One was very small, but the other was pretty large. the management didn't want to repair it at first, then when they did repair it, it was with a completely different carpet. So now I have a smelly apartment with patches of different carpet and am paying just as much as other people who don't have these problems. The manager told me it wasn't a big deal because the patch is in the carpet and since I didn't pay for platinum I should expect to have bad carpeting. I'm sorry, but you should not have to deal with holes and patched up carpeting. I would be charged for that if I left the carpet in that state during a move out so it should be replaced for me if I move in and it is in that state.   Another problem is my bathroom. The tub has chips on the bottom and the shower head sprays everywhere when turned on. Also my bedroom door was installed incorrectly and doesn't close. The place is just run down and the only way you'll get a nice place is if you shovel out the extra $100/month for a "platinum" apartment.   Things might get fixed for me, but so far I've been given the run around by management and have been very displeased by the state of the apartment when I moved in. I would highly recommend looking at your actual apartment before your move in date if you are able to.

Love this location. The staff are always very nice and friendly. I feel bad because sometimes they seem a bit overwhelmed at the mall's busy times, but they bring you soda, water etc to make you comfortable while you wait. There are also nice couches in the back to sit on. This location also has a great selection on full priced new items AND sale items. I feel like they always have unique shoes and purses on sale that I don't find online or in other stores.

I go here to get my eyebrows waxed and have yet to be disappointed. Britney who did my brows last time especially does a great job. I've always received a great consultation on my brow shape and have had no problems with them turning out crooked or too thin. The reception is always very nice and helpful about getting people in for an appointment.  Make sure to arrive a little early for your appointment because depending on the time of day or day of the week parking at this location can be annoying. Sometimes I'll be driving around forever at the marketplace looking for a spot.

Had an appointment at 9 am this morning to get my windows tinted on my 2010 Civic Coupe. I kind of had done some outside research and knew what tint I wanted, but the owner, Rick, let me know all of my options. I was kind of thinking about going for the mroe expensive option, but I went with my initial decision and got the SunTec I had originally decided on. They have very clear displays of all the tint options for people that have no clue about window tint. (such as myself) And Rick was very helpful in helping me choose my tint. I didn't feel like he was trying to upsell me or anything.   They had apple TV and free wifi with a big screen and some couches so I just stayed there for the two hours to watch some Netflix. When my car was done I was charged a bit more than I was quoted, but Rick refunded me the money because he had quoted me an old price by accident. I was a little miffed at first, but I got my money back so all was good with the world!  I went home and as I was driving I noticed some scratches in the tint. Unfortunately for me I live all the way in Tempe so I called them when I got home and they said to come back and have it fixed. I drove back up there and they fixed the tint on my windows. It turns out that one of the scratches on my passenger side  was a scratch on the actual window, but the ones on my drivers side needed to be redone.   I wasn't too annoyed because it got fixed, but it just sucked that I was there from 9:00am-2:00pm and I had to drive back and forth from Tempe. The owner was very nice and apologetic and offered to buy me lunch, but I felt weird taking his money. In the end my car's tint job looks good and every snag hit along the way was met with a "no problem we'll fix it" by the company. They seemed really busy so that could have factored into why I had some problems.   I am just knocking off a star for the inconvenience of having to go back and forth an wait forever on my day off as I had other errands to run, but I would recommend this place to anyone else. My car looks good and if I have any problems with my tint I know that I can bring it in and they will be abel to work with me.

I'm new in town and was looking for a good place to eat so I decided to try this place out. It was actually really good! I god the Hawaiian burger which had ham on it so it was different than any other Hawaiian burger I've ever had. I went for the smaller sized party and was still stuffed. The sauce was also delicious and our waitress was super nice. I would definitely go back.

I went to this Tory Burch outlet on my way back from Utah to Arizona and was so fricking excited. I went in with the intention of dropping some serious coin. I went straight for the shoes and omg what a nightmare. there was stuff everywhere, people everywhere, and nobody to help me. I asked for a few shoes in my size and they didn't have ANYTHING in my size. It was really frustrating. To be honest I didn't think the prices were that much of a steal. I find just as good of deals during their specials or in store when things are on sale.   I think it's a cool thing, I mean there aren't many outlets for Tory Burch, but I wouldn't go out of my way again for it.

I moved to Arizona in August and was in desperate need for a hair stylist. a friend of mine from work recommended I go to Nancy at Vincent's hair Studio. She is seriously the best. I have naturally blonde hair and dye it a golden red and she got the color spot on! I love my color and it never fades. She always makes extra time for her clients and is the sweetest. My hair is pretty long and heavy and she always give me a cut with smooth layers that makes my hair feel light and voluminous. So cute!   The salon is clean and all the staff are friendly. The owner is always present and they frequently have cookies and things brought in by employees! It adds a nice touch to make you feel like the salon has a great sense of family. The prices are very reasonable (I moved from San Diego so maybe I'm used to inflated SoCal prices). The only thing is some stylists don't take cards as payment so make sure you bring cash or checks!

I came here the other day on a whim because some friends and I were craving some cupcakes and we always see this place on our way to school. We had to wait a bit for it to open because it as 10:45 and it opened at 11:00, but whatever. We just sat in the Starbucks a few doors down until it opened up. I got the cupcake of the day, I believe it was raspberry peach or something, and my friends got carrot cake and lemon.   I don't know they both seemed to enjoy their cupcakes, but for me it was way too sweet. I prefer a rich and moist cupcake over one that tastes like straight up sugar. Lots of them also looked like they had too much frosting. That is mainly the reason I chose the one I did. It looked as if it had the least amount of frosting on it. I wasn't too impressed with the selection. They had a few flavors, but not as many as I've seen in other cupcake places.   The last thing I was annoyed with was their cupcakes are not made fresh at their location, they ship them in from another one so once they are out, they are out. And if you come at the end of the day ,you are getting old ones from the morning. Not like other places where they ill keep baking throughout the day.

Meh I've been here a couple of times and it was just ok. A few of my friends had hyped this place up so I expected it to be amazing. The menu seemed a lot smaller then what was online. The shakes were also just ok. For the price I also expected better. It's not horrible, but it is definitely not the first place I'd go for a burger.   Also the service isn't excellent. I think it's kind of weird how all the girls have red lipstick, and nails. The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu. I'd much rather go to the In-N-Out down the road.

I have only been to the Tempe location and loved the food there, but was looking for a more "upscale" atmosphere to take my parents to when they were in town.  This place was perfect. The patio seating was beautiful. It had nice shade from trees and other patio overhangs and the servers didn't forget you when you sit outside. The inside was just as nice too, but a little bit more noisy. The food here was just as impressive as the other locations. I got the leek soup and The Greek pasty and they were so good. I would also recommend their iced teas! They have some pretty great flavors as opposed to just the traditional iced tea.   Great service, great atmosphere, and great prices. Can't beat this place.

Went here last night to see a movie for the first time. Parking was a little annoying, but that was to be expected for any place on Mill. The actual movie theater was awesome! My ticket was only $7.50 which was so cheap for the quality of the theater. It has reclining seats and a really big screen. I normally get annoyed with seats that recline too much because I feel like the seat in front of me hits me or something, but I felt like I had plenty of leg room. It was like watching a movie in my house.   The only problem I had was that when I bought my ticket the guy didn't give me the option of where to have my seats. So I was kinda bummed about that. I wish I could have had an option like the AMC Esplanade does.
