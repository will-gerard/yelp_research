I had this on my TO DO list for a very long time. Glad I finally visited. I went for the Sunday Music in the Park, which was nice, so was the BBQ & wine. Walking through & seeing all the amazing glass sculptures was awesome. So got a 3-4-1 experience: garden, glass, concert.  I would highly recommend to see before the glass exhibit is gone! I can't see it being anywhere near as fantastic otherwise.

If memory serves me correctly, this might have been the best lunch I've ever had. (maybe the most $$$ as well, goes hand-in-hand).   Melted Brie with grilled apples, pears, strawberries? YUM !   3 onion Tarte? Very sweet, BUT the Sav Blanc cut through the sweetness with it's grassy edge & complimented it perfectly (you have to bring your own, if you don't already know).   The spicy Asparagus soup? SLURP! (again, i never thought I'd say this, but the wine went perfectly & cut through the heat quite nicely).   Filet Mignon on cibatta was interesting: diced, served with avocado, but the downer was that it suppose to be served with pomme frittes, but it came with like frito lay ripple chips - kinda really ruined the presentation - big time.   Italian coffee - o ya.   Chocolate Mint Grenache nauche Torte ? Heaven, I'm in heaven...   The half point demerit, or star - Wait a minute - u cant do that here !!! if i could, I would - the incessant pounding and banging in the kitchen !! They were tenderizing meat almost the entire time here - Grrrr - it's a very tiny place, so yes, we could definitely hear it. alot.   That said, it was a great afternoon. Very special.  But certainly not in the pocket book to frequent again in the very near future.  Next business dinner I would love to suggest the private dinning room & lounge for sure !

Based on special WIne Tasting event @ Bar.  {Otherwise i could NEVER see how i could/would dine here - case in point: initially seated in dinning room. Took quite a while to have our (very snotty & uppity) server apporach us.  We inidicated we were doing their special event, and OMG did he ever show he did NOT want any part of THAT with US}  We (ThankFully) asked to be moved to lounge area which only had 2 other tables being served.  (I just KNEW we would have had a more than terrible  time with Mr. Crabby Pants had we stayed in his section).  We were promptly moved, seated & served in very quick succession.  Turned out BEST decsion.  We were given professional & informative tastings of wines from Napa & South Africa.    Although this was a fun, different and good little event, and we really enjoyed it, it was NO where near as great an experience that we had at the CG in North Scottsdale 2 weeks earlier, ie: NITE and DAY difference.  (pours were half the size, and they were extremely hesitant, if at all, to give another taste of 1 which u may have liked....  I WOULD go back to N. Scottsdale for a Wine & Dine but i would never suggest getting a "10" on the Snob-O-Factor here.

Have you tried Fireside Sunday evenings? A band, outdoor patio seating, best view in the state, firepits, heat lamps, free buffet (if your table spends $20+ on drinks, easliy done! esp. since they have drink specials). Great for family, kids, older, younger, date nite.

I think this resort, and it's grounds, has to be the most romantic, sexy, and charming in all of AZ.  I luv visiting as many of the resorts here in Scottsdale & Phoenix as much as possible, as all of them have so much to offer to delight all the senses.  From the second you drive up to the lush & palatial grounds, you know you've come to the right place.  Any stress or worries disappear immediately.  I felt transported 9000 miles away in Europe.  Make sure you slowly walk around and literally smell the flowers.  The attention to detail is everywhere, including candles lit on the stairs - Awwwwwww !  The lounge is L-shaped, so it's perfect to find a quiet nook for 2, or join in & meet new people at the welcoming bar, or a sofa.  The martinis were shaken and poured in the most excellent manner - and man, am i seriously picky about ingredients, the mix, the shaking,  presentation, and the pour (please have little ice floating, please be ICE cold, frozen tini glass earns extra points!).    Since we had eaten a very late lunch, we seriously wanted to try the nosh items, but only had room for the utterly amazing Chick Peas - I think they were flash fried?  But the were so addicting!  WOW.  Since they were offering a really good special on a 2000 bottle of Perrier Jouet of Champangne, that topped off the night, while flute in hand, we strolled the gorgeous grounds,  OK, seriously?  I am going back before the end of the week.  (And strongly hinting we should go all out & book next month before their summer specials end.....)

All your pet needs - 1 roof.  Vet service good, although big vet change-over. Reasonably priced, espcially on days like Tues & Thurs 1-3 (times/days change, so ck in advance) where u do not pay the $25 exam fee - big difference if you have several pets.  (Yup, i have 3 dog, 3 cats: makes a difference!)  Meca for hundreds of products - i just wish more clearance, sales, coupons and customer appreciation discounts.   Groomers ok, although last time they changed their policy with me & wouldn't not let me hold my 5lb Chi~Chi while nails getting clipped, the guy was quite rough & brisk in grabbing her and snipping, so I left w.o him finishing.  In the past, they used to let you hold while they clipped all the nails in 60 seconds flat - worked for me!   Overall, I'll still be back for pet basic needs, but not the groomers.

Handy.  Close-by.  If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.  There has been a couple times, over the course of 6 years,  when they have been booked when I needed a vet immediately, and I think twice I went to the desert ridge location.  (With 3 dogs and 3 cats, the need has arisen a few times that we needed a vet NOW).    Generally they see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, should you wish.  I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.  During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie, we had her going between the outrageously expensive Sonora Vet and here, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to her cancer and a broken front leg.  They were happy to provide us with care on the side, and in between vists @ Sonora, for a fraction of what was quoted at Sonoran.    Sadly, it came to a point that her quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing her to continue in the state she was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put her down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.  They allowed us to hold her, cradle her and pet her the whole time.  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.  They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.  We'll keep going back.  Which reminds me, our 2 other dogs are both due for their rabies and annual visits.  They hold weekly clinics where they waive the exam fee (around $25 per animal - it adds up!), so I need to inquire when their next clinic is.

Customer service is always top notch - returns always easy, greeters always helpful.    I have never had a problem using 2,3, 4 or even 5 coupons for 20% off or their $5 off discounts either.    Great clearnace, good end of season sales, amazing selection of colors for bedroom or bathoom.  Excellent space savers & container suggestions for clutter.  Love their glassware like Ridel & Elisch & Mikasa stemware.

I haven't used my library card in over a year (no idea how i racked up the $20 in over-due fees).   Anyhow, what i luv about this place?  The used book corner.  This is where u can snag mags, children's books, novels, cd's, videos, altas, library discards, ect.  I like donating my books, but I LOVE picking thought the selection of goodies for 25 & 50 cents.  Reminds me, my shelves are over-flowing - time to donate again.

My Candy Store :-)  All the girls always friendly & helpful.  Rarely anything out of stock.   Unless there's an event or special launch (book an appointment for these free make-overs - not to miss!) someone is almost always available to provide you with a makeover or at the very least, a mini make-up application.

Active Lifestyle? Ck it out! I always find deals on shoes for hiking, running, walking.  Sales are great.  When I ck similar products at other sport stores, Big 5 always seems to have better sales & discounts.  Staff always available to help & assist. Returns and exchanges have been painless.    I'll be back as soon as I wear out my next runners :-)

Not sure how I have forgotten to write a high-5 for this store, since I've been going for several years.  I usually find exactly what I am looking for, whether it's the newest "have-to-have-it" piece of make-up from Smashbox, Benefit, POP, Two-Faced, or Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo, Conditioning Mask, Fabby Bling for the hair, sexy candles, and nifty travel items like dry shampoo, hair wipes, individual nail polish removers, tiny mascaras, little mascaras, travel toothbrushes.  I have found the sales clerks to bit a bit on the sad, bored-to-death look, or alot of times don't -even -want -to -be- there vibe, but i rarely need assistance to look around, espcially the sales shelf where I generally find 75% off goodies (yesteday I found some amazing cocomut body butter, Redkins men's set, face cream, hairbrush, travel items - all 75% off).  I'll be back when I'm in need of my next hair product gook - but i'm stocked to the gills with 2 bathrooms full at the moment :-)  (P.S. flyer tip - wait till after tuesday when stocked, not on the sunday when the specials are advertised, as they likely are still in the stock room, not on the shelves, or have yet to be deliever,  for some un-known reason.)

Shoes, and purses, and make-up - o my!  Your sales totally RAWK guys!  I mean, seriously - 50-70% off (gotta catch it just right, people) and then, an extra 30% off that?!  I feel like a wild thing, you make my heart sing.  OK, now today, the most I found was 40% off - B U T - then there's MAC!  Oooooooo, ya baby.  All that glitters is NOT gold.  (ok, it's the small things...)  It was still fun to look at all the purses.... And mark some for future reference.  Hey, I am a patient person.... I stop for red - tags, that is.

O Boy, why is it when I think i can slip in for 1 particular book, I am in here for over an hour, and find it hard to leave?    Store Lay-Out is inviting & sections are easily found.  Lots of space between isles.  It's usually quite easy to track down a store clerk for help and inquires.  O, and if u sign up with there email, you get coupons on a regular basis - which reminds me: today I have a coupon for 40% off any item in the store - now, how cool is that?  Off to go use it!

Want a unique date night?  Craving for something to do on your own?  Want to have an avenue to express your inner artistic abilities?  OK, here you go!  Very interesting concept: Pick a piece of pottery, think of what you would like to design on it, you can draw your idea on with pencil, go grab your paints, brush, sponges, or stencils, and away you go.  They will then fire & glaze it, ready to pick up your masterpeice in a few days,  A great place to zen out and leave all your stress and worries at the door.    Good for a keepsake, special gift, 1-of-a-kind conversation piece, or create a memory.  1 star lost for the very annoying and extremely intrusive studio "helper" which I will leave un-named.  Kinda ruined alot of the experience.  I should say that if you need assistance, you can have it, but when you do NOT need it, well, please leave us alone - ie: i f you are in Barnes & Noble, you don't need a clerk to repeatedly come up to you every 10 mins to ask if you are going to buy that book or they read it, or do you want a better suggestion..... ect.

4 visits.  GR8 place to hit before or after a movie @ Harkins.  Happy Hour is full of values.  I especially like that premium wines are discounted and the pours are huge -  You get a third of a bottle  = 2 big glasses.  (Oh, I am big on quality glasses, and they actually serve really nice, uniquely shaped crystal stemware - bonus points there - I mean that's where the the 5th star comes in).   Chicken lettuce wraps are yummy (ie: no guilt here!).  Keep that bruschetta coming!  OK, have to admit, the sweet potato fries are really, really good.  Last night, just before going to the screening of Knight & Day,  everything arrived within minutes of ordering: from the appetizers, to meals, to entrée-to-go and every drink. (insert a "Todd-High-5" here)

I don't go to a heck of a lot of movies in theatres (I'd rather curl up with my beloved NetFlix with a beautiful glass of wineand watch on my 5' x 7' theatre projection screen,  than walk on popcorn and lean my head back on a chair on wonder how many other heads of hair were here last).  But I have to say, there the experience at Cini Capri makes the theatre going experience something I don't mind going to in this cinema.    Now, if only they had a full service bar - why don't movie theatres do that, btw ??  (that's why the minus 1 star...)

Been going here since it opened, 5 yrs ago.  LUV the ambiance, the decor, patio, dancing, service, food & drinks.  You can't beat their happy hour.  If you want quiet time, go Thur or Fri early, patio is nice, or at any of their 4 bars.  Food & drinks 1/2 off - Wha~Hoo.  Place totally changes vibe by 9pm, older crownd leaves, in comes younger girating hips.

WHAT. THE. HECK?! This place has gone to CRAP since new mngt.  EVERYTHING has gone down hill.  They fired all the long-standing bartenders & servers (the ones who knew what they were doing).    The last time we went they served our food with PLASTIC forks, paper napkins and PLASTIC plates?!  (surprised our martinis didn't come in sippy cups?!?)    Will NOT be back, ESP. since the FABBY new ANGEL's & OUTLAWS just opened around the corner - guess who opened it?  The management who kept Devil's running smoothly for 5 years !!  (and the bartenders joined them :-)

Ok, for some unknown reason, I have veins the size of an infant.  Hence, a baby needle is required.    Now, if they had to try more than once, which, if it was any other staff housed elsewhere,  I can totally imagine a nightmare occurring along the lines of tears, frustration, anger-management courses and "The-slap-heard-around-AZ" - happy to report: none of things happened!    The girls are so kind & patient.  I don't know how it's actually possible to laugh in a bloodletting setting, but it did!  I've had blood work done about 6 times the past 3 years, and the human touch & empathy is actually alive and kicking in these quarters.  Much Appreciated!    (can't exactly say hope to see you guys soon.....)

There's a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna do?  There's a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna go?  I'm gonna fix that rat thats what I'm gonna do,  I'm gonna fix that rat.   Well, if it WAS my kitchen i would...  so this place has it all, including live entertainment which was all included in the price.  (bonus)  Headlining tonite were The Rats!  They were a HUGE success -not-   Seriously, kids counted 4 rats running up along the pipes, no kidding.  Pointed it out to the waitress and she knew about the rodent dinners, as they just had an exterminator in.  So at least now i know why I have lived only a few blocks away from here, drove past several hundred times, and have never gone in.  (but now i can say, I've seen the Double WOW: Miss "Maxi Mounds" - 2003 Guiness World Book of Records for Umm, well you figure it out.  Hubby and son were speechless about that entertainment as well, so bring the kids!)  Daughter says that the styrofoam plates were not what she was used to, (to put it nicely).  Son suggested that you should NOT bring your date here, {1st, 2nd, 3rd or even 4th date} - not a good idea.  He said it isn't the "worst place" to go to but that if you're looking for classy, then go to Sapporo.  Either the noodles had a wierd taste of plastic to them, or they obtained the funk from the plastic bowls.  I have to say our waitress was really nice, but although she was quick to suggest items off the menu: noodles weird taste my mongolian beef was just "ok' house peanut sauce chicken lacked any pow  the curry chicken was ordered extra spicey but had no kick  None of us ate more than 1/2 our bowls.  Me? about 1/4 - so glad, or I'd be in the bathroom were hubby & son are sitting right now (not sure what the term for the Chinese verison of New Dehli Belly is?  Hong Kong Pooie?  Now I know why the 1 platter was called Pu~Pu Royal - yes, I'm serious.)

My poor little princess - she has been throwing up since 5am.  My itty bitty 9 yr old has not vomitted since she was a baby - now WHAT do u SUPPOSE brought this on?!?  Hmmmmmm, let's think about that for a moment.....  retrace what she may have eaten, perhaps???  Unbeknownest to me, hubby obliged his daughter's begging to please buy her a Teriyaki Chicken Noodle Bowl.    BIG MISTAKE!  other than her regular bowl of cereal in the morning, there was nothing else she ate - except this lovely dish.  She has cramps, stomach ache, diarrhea, and yes, down to almost dry heaves now.  She is alseep beside me on the sofa, and very upset to have missed today at school.  Home from school.  Sick.  From eating at this "Gourmet Chinese" ? ! ?  did we fix that rodent problem yet guys?!  disgusting..........

Walked past this store dzns of times & never went in! Not sure why, but glad i finally did!    We were greeted immediately and in a nice & unobstrusive way.  We were given a few samples, and it was pretty clear i was not going to make a purchase this time since all the products were new & different to me, I was just gettting educated :-)  This didn't hinder the salesperson, who still gave me some cupons, samples & a full bar of rosemarry soap!    The sample ended up making me go back 2 days later, as the shave cream was the best shave hubby ever encountered!  I purchased and entire shave kit with lots of goodies, more samples, and the sales girl threw in a bamboo soap dish (bonus!).  I'll be back to ck out more products after i finish using up my arsenal already in my possesion!

Had a delivery 1st wk/Sept - told them we had dogs in the BACkyard & not to worry BUT delivery van stopped at our open entrance gate & did not come in.  Thankfully, we were putting our the trash & caught him.  2 wks later, another delivery came when i was out.  They left notice on a side entrance bdrm door!  NOT the front door (very easy to find!) and said they rang doorbell - if that was the case, WHY didn't they leave note there?  When we called, owner was defensive, rude, and didn't want to listen to us, indicated we had dogs - when we ordered we said do NOT mind the dogs (behind 6' wall!!).  Arrogant, stuck-up florist.  Who do they think they are???

Haven't gotten a tat -yet! Went for a piercing.  These r the kinda places that, no, you wouldn't think to go for a regular "I'm going to get my ears pierced" kinda place. But yup, i did. I have 6 on my ears, 2 closed up, so i had them re-done.   I had the preconcieved notion i would be scoffed at with such a miniscle request apon walking in - not so!  I was treated with respect, & full service, as if i had never had something like this done before. (I was likely their easiest client ever - lol).  I really appreciated not having eyes rolled at for such a tiny job.  Talk about taking their job serious!  Thanx!  (maybe next time the tat.... u never know)

Great big/little unique toy store.  Most, if not all, of their toys are very educational, unique, and/or classic toys, as well as numerous items which have "Best Toy Awards".    I think I spent over 1.5 hours looking at the displays, playing with them, or looking through the books.  (Not sure who had more fun, me or kids ?).

I've not stayed at the resort - yet - hopefully this summer for one of their special family pkg rates :-)  We did a couples massage here.  We had booked a special rain massge, at the last minute the quailified person to give it was unavailble, unfortuantely.  So we had just regular massage, side by side - still nice :-)  Still, we made an afternoon of it, spa, walked the grounds, glass of wine in the lobby.  If you book a spa treament, be sure to give yourself alot of time to really enjoy everything, don't just run in, get service & dash.

Wait a minute - am I actually writing about a tire shop?!  yup (wow)  Very prompt and efficient service.    The workers practically salute & snap to attention, running this way and that each time we take the RV in to check the tire pressure.  (Which is sometimes every other month).    You get in and out in no time, even on a Saturday.   Special tire orders, if there's a slight chance it's not in style, takes 24-48hrs.  (speaking of which, I have 2 waiting to be picked up - gotta go)

over 20 visits - and no rvw?  wow - i must be loosing it.  When I walk through the beautiful shoping district of Kierland, it is always fun to window shop - ok gotta go in! - and touch, feel, ooo, ya - and dream about having my home decorated with all thier furnishings... as soon as i win the lottery.. or something... almost there.  (maybe i should stop travelling......... nah...)  anyWHO - you CAN find some GR8 little snags: from candles, to books, vases, martini glasses (always a must, since somehow - not sure why, mine keep getting smashed - maybe goes hand-in-hand with vodka + consumption + beautiful galsses = tipsy, topsy, turvy - crash)  I always enjoy looking, (and usually grabbing something i "need" ya, right) and thinking about where or what I might get for a gift - naaaaaaah - for me!  next...

Got Watch?  Seriously, right now, who can say they have a watch that:  needs a new crystal,  a repair,  new band,  re-sized,  or a battery?    Ya, I thought so!  So what are you waiting for?  (and I know you have more than 1, btw).  So gather them up and bring them on over.    (or the poor Coo~Coo Clock with the dead bird inside, or the Clock which no longer has the creepy Twilight Zone "Bong" at midnight - x's 12)  Great little family run business, which I think has been at this location many years.  They offer very professional repair on all styles of watches and clocks with any array of issues.

Awesome Custom work!!  I've had 2 rings custom made, both turned out exactly how I wanted.  The 1st ring, I had quotes of $3000, but Rod (owner & Jeweler for 30+ yrs) quoted around $1K.    Rod is extremely helpful & patient.  You can come back to see your design in mid-process, usually a wax model, to make any changes before being cast.  He has tons of designs, or bring in a pic of your own  - he'll be happy to make your dream come true!   I would highly recommend this little shop to anyone.  It's right beside Burger King, {same plaza as Sapporo's}.

I have gone to the spa about 6 times.  The couples massage was alot of fun - did that 3 times.  Special VIP double room.    They used to have the pkg with champange, fruit, and use of the dbl room with amazing waterfall shower, but for some reason they stopped all that.  I thought that was what made this special for us, but no longer. Sad.

How is it possible for me to have not only stayed here, but visited no less than 20 times, and not have written about it?   Luv the lobby bar & live entertainment, Spanish Guitar & Flamenco Dancing.  Our many out-of-town-guests thouroughly enjoy this.  The grounds are just stunning as you walk in from the lobby, down the stairs and out through the glass doors to the beautiful views.  1 of the most romatic things to do is the super unique gondola rides they have in the evening.  It always stuns a couple we bring here!  We surprise them by ending the evening with escorting them to the docks, and leaving them to fininsh their night off after thier private ride on the moon-lit lake.  (Complete with the gondolier singing professional Opera!)  Now, how cool is that?!

THE. WORST. MANI/PEDI    E -V -E -R .  Paid $55 for mani/pedi with french.  Every single nail bubbled after i got home.  This was because the layers, esp. the top coat, was GOBBED on, totally slimed.  Big Gooby, mess.  when it finally dried, it was a disaster.  I would have gone back for a re-do, but guess what?  I was on my way to the airport.  Had to get a re-do (and re-pay) out of town cuz it was so awful.  Of course, I go back in today, 2 wks later, discuss the situation with manger/employee/owner (she changes her title to suit the situation).  I said just a re-do, no charge, she said pedicure too?  Of course i said yes.  WELL guess what?  at the end, she wanted to charge me IN FULL same amount as last time.  I said calmly, i knew this was going to happen, it was your fault, bad job, got re-done elsewhere, she said i should have come back next day, i said i already told u on entering the problem, we had an agreement, no serivces were rendeered last time & i paid in full, this time: i will walk out now.  My husband said we will pay a discounted price, i said no such thing.  Hubby ended up paying for a reg. mani/pedi, only minus the french ($10 ooooo big deal).  This ordeal ended up costing $130 - for a mani pedi which normally is $30-33 anywhere else!!! 3x's normal.   Can't say you weren't warned!! With all the hundreds of choices out there, no way i'll be back.  No idea why anyone else would pick it either!

If it's an emergency, they will generally see you asap.  When we used to live in Desert Ridge, we had 2 dogs, 2 cats, there were times when I needed a vet immediately, and generally they will accommodate you in such a demise.  They see you pretty efficiently, but of course they will suggest things that I feel are not merited to add onto a bill, but it's your right to question their additions and refuse, of course.  I've never found them to be arrogant or pushy, they will easily offer other options, or be ok with your decision.  During 1 extremely difficult period with our beloved Rottie/Sheppard Mix, they were very understanding to the emotional distress we were experiencing with regards to his advancing old age - he was 17.  They were happy to provided us with care during his aging.  Sadly, it came to a point that his quality of life was no longer conducive to allowing him to continue in the state he was, and it when it came to making the horrible and very sad decision to allow them to put him down, the entire staff were so understanding, caring, and totally sympathetic to our demise.  They allowed us to hold him, cradle him and pet him the whole time.  We were allowed as much time as we wanted before, during and after the whole life-altering circumstance.  They even sent us a sympathy card, signed by all the staff, after the terrible ordeal we went through.  During another trying experience we had to endure, our boxer mix was attacked by another dog and needed emergency care.  We were now closer, and under the care of the Tatum/Shea location, but they were unable to see us.  This location was able to open up their schedule to see us under this distressing circumstance.  They provided expert care and glad to say that he mended just fine, with no lasting ill-effects.

I totally agree with another rvw: they really explain the piercing, area, pros & cons - if u go in asking 4 a certain place/area/piercing & it is not right 4 u, they will explain why & not do it - 4 good reason.    This is the place to go for those, um "unique" and, ah, "interesting" piercings.    Done right, done well, good service.  (even if bedside manner not a hold-your-hand-i'm-your-best-friend-we-can-talk sorta thing :-)

Went to see "The Butterfly Garden" presented by the Italian traveling group TPO.  This was such a treat!  It was basically aimed towards a very young audience, so I took my 9 year old.  She absolutely loved it.    Very unique presentation preformed with amazing display of light, sound, touch and music.  They interacted with the children in the small and intimate setting, (we sat on cushions, on the stage, around their set), to assist them in their presentation of the life of a caterpillar/butterfly.  The technology on the sensitive mat responed to the actors movements & their actions were picked up with an over-head light projection sensor as well.    It's too bad they were only in town for a few days because I think anyone who missed bringing their minion to this specail treat really missed out on a very cool production!

Rose colored glasses: do most buy, and subsiquaintly wear, them to here?  I so highly anticipated visiting this on my "To~Do List"  Um, Why??!?  After finding the 'secret doorway', {Oooooo .... Ahhhhh ... )  we entered into a darkened, and basically empty bar room.  (There were 2 patrons sitting at the bar).  Apon entering, we were never once greeted, nor seated.  We took it on ourselves to find a table.  And waited.... and watched.... the 2 people at the bar chatting it up with the bartender.  After several uncomfortable minutes, we were..... ah, uncomfortable.  Never acknowleged, not once.  Hmph.           (I think I was worthy of being served..... or did i not know the password?? secret handshake??? was i suppose to walk in backwards? knock 3 times?  ask for charlie?  guess i got it all wrong, obviously).  So, it wasn't busy, we didn't have B.O., we were dressed up, patient.... what was going wrong with this picture???   I'm glad to say, we didn't drop a dime here - from the other rvws, staying meant enduring snotty servers, which I could only (& rightfully) say we would have encoutered.  We promplty left, and went to the Canal, had the most FABBY time, and a beautiful evening, which (most likey) would have been a disaster had we stayed here :-(

Now i recall why I haven't been here in so long: WAY over inflated prices!  I got lured in with discount  cut-outs in mags, coupons, mailers - all in 1 mth, so I thought, hey, why not take advanage of some money saving opportunity?  Laura's (amazing) goat cheese was DOUBLE what you can purchase in Fresh & Easy (exaxct same amount & packaging $6 vs $3 - about a glof ball sz amount).    Did i mention all the moldy pitas in the bread section? (Ewww!).  Oh, bought wine, um the $60 kind - it was OFF!  (when the cork almost falls out of the bottle, dry, clean, there is your 1st clue).  The wine & liqours where so over-inflated it was unbelievable: ie: grey goose for $35 (always around $10 less at places like safeway & albertson's).  The high end wines (duck horn, ect.) 25% or more less at Phoenix Wine. Also,  I saw about only 5% of their wine that were actually on sale.  At check out, our discount was incorrect - we only saw in the car.  Went back in for adjustment, realized still incorrect. After 3 tries, they finally gave us the correct discount amount off $200 purchase.  Will I be back?  Even with several major discount coupons I could still use, no way do I have any desire to return to this uppity over-priced estabishment.

I've been here on previous occasions, not sure why I never wrote a rvw previously - maybe because each time was just not memorable.  This one was - and not in a good way.  The funny thing is, we had just attended a Yelp event @ P.I.G. and I really wanted a nice glass of wine, so I was wearing my name tag with Yelp on it (Ooops).  When the Bar Staff saw it, I took it off right away - BUT don't you think that may have prompted a little bit of nice or prompt service, just a tad????  Nope.   Poor guy next to us had been visiting on a reg. basis many, many times and could not believe how bad the service was this nite.  We each had our bill sit, with our credit cards in full view, for 30 mins when we had to ask the server to ring us out - much to her dismay at being pulled way from her current task at hand: polishing that one glass for over 20 mins.  He also mentioned he always obtained comp. potato crisps, which I saw all around us, but none were offered in our direction?  During that time, we saw a group of 6 business men come in, sit down in the lounge chairs and never get an acknowledgment, greeting, menu, or service.  We're talking $100 just for 1 round of drinks here!  1 had to approach the bar and ask for a server, and ours practically rolled her eyes and muttered someone will be over shortly.  Let me tell you, this place was far from busy!  Everyone shot out at the stroke of HH ending like crazy so it was pretty empty by this time.  I see no reason to ever return - at all.

Over the years, i have popped in about a 1/2 dzn times.  I keep thinking that somehow it may change, for the better, but that never happens.  Never once have i been made to feel very welcomed.  Wines by the retail bottle are over-priced by 20-40% more than what I purchace them for at Phoenix Wines.  It's too bad they have such expensive wines by the glass and th 'cheese plate' is Ridiculously priced - you can pick out your cheese from the fridge.  (I think a chunk of cheese and some crackers were $17 last time).  It's a shame because they have a GR8 location & a nice cozy outdoor patio, but I just can't find myself relaxed nor able to enjoy myself when I get fleeced or find it not worth paying these price, esp. when for MUCH less I can go to a hundred other lounges or resorts or up-scale bars for much better service & atmosphere.  Sorry guys,but I really did try you - again & again - always to no avail :-(

Who can resist the taste from childhood which sometimes calls to you at 9pm on a random week night?   I like it simple: a chocolate or caramel dipped cone.  Yup, That's it.  Nothing fancy.  And how can you resist like 1 of the last horsey rides for 25 cents left on earth?  (Yes, it play High-Ho-Silver)  (I'm not sure who gets more joy, me or the child I put on it - or maybe i sorta try to sneak on it)

Been MANY times. Done Happy Hour, Bar, Reg. Tables, Patio, and of course the Teppanyaki Tables (Awesome).  Every single visit, all food, all drinks, service always good.  Mind you, if you try the bar on a Thur or Fri Happy Hr, good luck even trying to find standing room, let alone a drink!  You have to fight for your rights.  All in all GR8 experience.  Luv the Kobe burger (& sweet potatoe fries).  BEST SUSHI anywhere AZ.  I think this is a dressy place & hate seeing casual attire there (flip flops, caps, runners).  Great Place for see/B/seen, fabby lunch specials, kids will luv cook tables - always an experience with out of town visitors :-)

Been 3x's - { if u stay @ Venitian Resort & get free passes, btw}. Otherwise GO EARLY if u don't want to wait in a disney line-up of 2hrs! Once u get in, standing room only - unless u get private room - always nice!  heh heh.  depending on how many friends, it is WORTH it - i only had a party of 4, private room, server, drapes - luciaous, baby.   - how do u spell A W E S O M E??

We've been visiting this resort since the very day it opened.  Even when we lived w/n walking distance we would stay!  Now we are 25 mins away, and still have amazing wknd get-aways. Views, food, rooms, lobby, spa all GR8!  Summer has dive-in movie pkgs.  Luv to people watch in the huge lobby.  Rooms decorately in lively happy colours.  The only downer is the high cost of the kids club, which i hate.  (Princess resort is free!).  Sunday brunch is Fabby.  Drinks around the outdoor fire pits is beautiful.  Treat someone to a gorgeous view & drink 1 day or nite - i will blow them away.  (ie: glass of champange with bowl or strwaberries n cream - wow - how romantic is that??)

Dilemma: where the heck to find a nice place to eat near AZ Fairgrounds/Grand? (Shiverrrrrrrrrrrrr)  Promblem solved!  Found the answer @ Fez!  Candace was super speedy, always had a smile, and returned to our table about a dzn times in the 90 mins we were here.  Gazpacheo & Grilled Crustini was OMG good!  (problem was it only came with 3 tiny pieces of bread, had to ask for more, got few pieces of pita, still had 1/2 left bowl of gazpacheo, asked for more bread - cuz like what the heck are you going to do with a bowl of dip otherwise? and they charged us for the extra bread?  x 2 ?  not cool).  Cheese & Garlic Fondue was pretty good.  So was the Chicken Strips.  Really good drink specials (unfortunately, had none as their specialties are mostly tequila based - not for me!  nor am I a beer drinker, and I did not like their house wine).  But I did have a nice bottle of Sav. Blanc from New Zealand.  Anyhow, this fit the bill at having fabby Nom~Noms before heading over to the Coliseum (~ick~) at the Fairgrounds to see the Roller Derby Girls - Whoop~ Whoop!

Had the BEST wine tasting experince in my life.  (and i've had QUITE a few).  This was experienced in their swanky bar area, in a sexy booth.   Oscar, you were BEYOND your beck and call.  Seriously, you were amazing, informative, helpful, professional, the whole package deal.  Your Service Was Impecable.  So, we had about 12 wines to choose from, 1/2 from Napa, 1/2 from South Africa.  And we are NOT talking 1oz pours here, they were given in beautiful, large crystal goblets.  (I so hate little wine glass which sell for 25 cents).  (and yes, we had them ALL :-)  These were free poured, let me tell you!  And they gave a great little booklet of the wine, year, description to keep and log your tasting notes.    Hubby and I played hookie on this beautful Thursday afternoon, and it was divine.    I sure hope they have this even again, cuz i am so THERE.  Oh, i guess i should mention we did have some food - haha - the crispy roasted half chicky was YUM, and so were the truffle fries - omg.

GOT BIKE?!   This is the perfect place to take the ride!  (motorcyle, in case of any confusion)   For some reason i luv sunday's best - 5pm. (ck out the rows of bikes :-)  Great to hook up, meet, go with, take. someone.  Luv the casual attmosphere - not normal @ scottsdale!   So put on your leathers, your bike gear, or your cowboy boots, hat & belt, and get ready to pull up a picnic table bench seat & meet new friends!

Live around the corner. Usually in summer there at least 1x/wk.  (1/2 off bottles of wine - wadda deal!).  Luv the chineese salad, grilled chicken sandwhich.  Hubby luvs the roast beef or the hamburger with brie & avo.  Usually sit @ bar where we can swap new wine tips, but patio is ok (kinda on the parking lot though).  Nice ambiance, good for office lunch/dinner, met up with friend, take out your parents :-)

If you don't get here by 11:50, you can pretty much have a 15-25 min wait, espcially if you want the patio - and we all want that.  Everyone else has done an excellent job in reviewing them & their food, so no sense to repeat.    Myself? i luv the chicken wrap - wow - such fresh ingredients, tender chicken, GR8 tatziki - how do you spell YUM?

Now, why haven't I hit them up for their HH before now?  $1 humus  $2 dolmaldes  $3 chicken & pine nuts  $3 glasses of wine?! (wow)  {and this wine snob actually liked both the white and red, each from Argentina.}   kids meal is $5 which includes fruit, drink, and things like pasta, chicken AND broccoli - it was a very big kids meal and extremely healthy. Alot of choices - cuz we all know how picky kids can be!   I am defiantly go back to partake of this amazing deal asap - esp now that the weather has broken and time to be outside on their patio!

Been wondering what all the fuss is about for ages.  Since we had spa treaments at Valley Ho, decided to ck it out.  Just so happens they started a new happy hour with $1, $2 & $3 appies - bonus!!  The ribs were good, pita & humus sure hit the spot, the pork shu wrap? was yummy, little burger & sweet potatoe fries cute.  I am so not a rum drinker, and all 50 (give or take) of their drinks are rum based - i think i did spy 1 gin drink & i zeroed in on the only vodka drink: their mai tai, (original version is with, yup: rum).    Jason at the bar was extremely attentive, even though he was only filling in from his regular serving in dinning room.    Overall it was fun, but since i am not into rum, not sure if it is my cup of tea, er, rum.  But for my 1 visit, it all went well.

THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY EVENING!  Yes, this place is a drive, but so beautiful and worth it!  After a terrible time at Cellar 13 & C4 (Cave Creek Wine & Coffee), we wondered what else to do since we were up North.  SO GLAD WE THOUGHT OF SASSI!!  Ron, the bartender was so eloquent and debonair.  It was like he knew us and welcomed us back with open arms.  WHAT a HUGE sigh of RELEIF after being treated so poorly at C4.  WHEW!  The chianti was just right, and the bruschetta was to die for: simple but perfect.  Beef skewers tender & juicy.  Olive bowl was unique and tasty: all different sizes, shapes, and color.    You are certainly treated like a somebody here, that's for sure!  I definatley have to come back more often, it is really worth the gorgeous drive - and the sunset!  W O W !

Part of the Fox Chain, which we frequent most ly each week. (Bloom, North, Greehouse, ect). Always fun, ESPECIALLY @ summer when bottles of wine are 1/2 off :-)

It is definatley time for an update!  after a few dozen ++ visits since last rvw!    Loved the cooking class last week in thier intimate executive room.  Sam Fox was available throughout the evening to give updates on FRC, to answer questions, and serve food.  Was very informative, and alot of fun.  Right now, there is a drop-dead special: 3 courses for $20 - yes, you heard me right: THREE course meal for less than the cost of an entree !!  O.M.G.  can't wait to go back - again, and again, and again.  Oh, HH is now 7 days/wk !   Whoooooooooooooo :-)

LUV this place!  We only live 10 mins away, but luv to stay here in the hot summer months - it is a toal get-a-way for a couple AND their kids! There is an amazing FREE kids club (i don't think i have come acorss any other one in the vallye - usually $45 for a 1/2 day - this is free - full day, full of activities AND a teen room as well.  Dive-in  movies fri & sat eves.  We always up grade to a casita - a full living/dining/patio/bdrm.  We barely see the kids during the day (club) and at nite there's the pool/movie.  If we want to exp. a late nite bar (rose - amazing patio) or dinner alone, we order a movie for the kids to watch in bed.  Will be back again summer '09 :-)

Been hiking these hills for about 5 years.  My favorite entrance is the main Parking lot, located off Shea & 40th St.  (North on 40 till it ends at the lot).  So many trail choices, so little time!  You can easily hike a few minutes on flat terrain, or difficult peak hikes almost up to elevations of 3000'.    I like the fact that, because you can design your own route, it never becomes boring.  If you want a 30 mins easy hike, or strenous 3 hour circut, it's all up to you.  I generally find that in the early mornings, it's very rare to run into other hikers.  (maybe 3-6 in 2 hrs).  So, that is a big ~Zen~Factor~ for me.  Here is the exact location and hiking trail map:  http://www.phoenix.gov/parks/hikphgud.html

Great little place in cave creek, which has alot of beer joints, but since I luv my wine, I luv ending up here.  (sorry, this review not based on their coffee - never had it!).  I agree with other rvw: whenever i visit, i wonder why it's been so long since i've been back!  I always wonder why I haven't bee to one of their outdoor concerts either, (my bad).

Why did did i come back here?  a 40 min drive north for what?!  with 200 fantastic places near me, i certainly do NOT have to drive to be treated like a LEPER by a snotty, uppity, arogant server!  When we walked into the bar area, the entire bar was empty.  For seating, there were 2 tables: 1 person seated at a table, 2 at the other.  The girl behind the bar acted frenzied, hurried, and like she wsa serving 37 people.    NO TIME FOR US - who were NOT LOCALS !  was the crisp and very clear message.  The CRAP wine by the glass advertised on the chalk board was enough to send me running out the door: $5/glass for what is sold for the bottle retail (gnarly head, voga, 3 rivers - KAK!).  I went over to the wine rack, and she said the Long Meadow Cab was on sale, instead of $60, she offered it for $45.  Since I had not had it previously, i was hesitant.  But I spotted a 1/2 bottle, so (i thought) i was in luck!!  I asked her how much (thinking it would be HALF of the full bottle - like $22?!?!)   NOT!  She said it was also the same price ?!  W T H ?!  are you kidding me?  Husband walked out, i followed....   (especially after seeing her treat another 2 walk in's in a deplorable way - no reason to treat people like they are beneath you - EVER!)

SO, as I've said previously, I don't do movie theatres on a regular occasion - why would I when I have NetFlix??? (and my wine, my silk robe, my bruschetta, the pause on my remote, my 5x7 projection screen, surround sound, feather pillows....)  Whoa, moving along...  Since this is still a fairly new cinema, it is in good condition and generally very clean.  Seats are plush and comfy.    Minus a star for the fact there's no bar serving wine..... why is that, btw???  (i mean, it's allowed at ball/hockey games and broadway theatre ???)  Hmmmm, makes you think....

I am lucky to still be in a city that still has a drive-in - either u luv em or u hate em - Or you have never been!  (beleive me, there is alot who have never been to a drive in !!!!)  Ahhhh, the good ol days - and we actually still have them here in scottsdale!  There are so many towns and cities who no longer have any left - all the land bought out all in the name of progress- out with the old in with the new.  If you haven't been, go now before there are no longer any left.    That said: there is an art form for attendance. (i think i have down-pat).  I bring camp chairs, blankets, candles, wine, popcorn, whole roast chicken, tomaotes, crossiants, OH!  and a cork screw - verrrry important.  So no, do not go to the snack bar - ewww.    o, and please do not drive in and out of the parking lot attempting to park & reverse 37 times with your freak'n lights on blinding everyone around you, thank you very much!

Yes, I survived March Break !  This place is something kids will like (not 4 moi though).  Tuesdays is a GR8 deal: wristband is $15 (i think it is $25 on other days).  This provides 4 hrs of playtime on bumber boats, go-karts, and all 3 of their mini-golf courses.  Pretty good deal  - I would not suggest going here in summer months at all - you will get heat-stroke!

You could drive past here several times & still miss it.  Tucked away, little sign.  But, when you do walk in, be prepared to find your favorite wine at way less than you've purchased it previously.  This is especially true if it is a high end wine or if you special order by the case.  Tom, the owner, will be happy to try to accomodate most any wine request.  I think if he can't get it, no one can LOL.  So don't be shy, ASK!

i had thought this was going to be great really!!  had this on my TO DO list 4ever.  Finally went, on a monday. Menu indicates "MONDAY MADNESS 1/2 glasses of wine". (see rvws below - monDAY - not for an hour or so). so i ended up ordering 3 glasses of wine - bill: all full price!! Was told only after 3:30. is it just me? A Happy Hr is usually 4-6 (or there-about) but monDAY is "DAY", as in during the DAY.  not a happy hr (or 2) special.  (rudely told: the web indicates this - {I never looked}, the inside blackboard says - {i was OUTside!} & inside the bill  folder- {umm, it was under a survey & AFTER my bill arrived???})  FLATbread was THICK, like reg. pizza, & had 1/2 cup of canned parm. cheese all over = can u say: dry, boring, mundane?  bread STICKS were huge, thick, doughy things  - my kids make ones from pillsbery dough which tasted same.  These were size of croissants, certainly not sticks - never seen any breadsticks that remotely resemble these in my life.  Should be called Pilsbery Dough Plate Special - i swear that's exactly what it was.  I seriously hate to provide a review like this, not to mention a confrontation which ensued when my bill arrived, but it was awful.  I could write many more upsetting details which occurred, but i won't - it would be petty.  Suffice to say I couldn't seriously think on going back. (i should  point out that eventually i did recieve the 3 glasses at 1/2 off, but the bill did not reflect any break on the 'flatbread' not 'breadsticks')

Do you love birds in your backyard (and want to keep them there??  fat, dumb & happy?)  Well, I'd suggest a visit here.  Every hummingbird feeder you can imagine.  Several different types of seed, feed, nuts, & fruit for the many other kinds of feathered friends you have - or want to have & attract.  Thining of a KOI pond? Check them out: their fish, feed, lillies, ect.  Tiny little estabishment, nestled between safeway & hallmark.

My neighborhood Hardware Store.  Man, could they be more helpful or attentive?!  I feel like I've walked onto the Pleasantville Movie Set every time I walk in the store!    Very helpful, courtious, pleasant (O there's that word again) days-gone-by service, lemme tell ya!  Even if I just want and purchase a light bulb, they make you feel like you dropped a grand.  (VIP)  where eles do you actually get that???

Either I was only given half a menu, or there is extremely limited choices for food selections?  (yes, the goat cheese appie, the only teaser on the menu other than a type of glorified French fry, was good).  The wine list was also small - 5 whites by the glass, a few more reds.  The (back bacon?) sandwhich I shared was very greasy & oily - ick.  We were invited to a Devoured Kick-Off event in which we were told we would be involved with 9 bartenders from different establishments who were going to make their concoctions, and that we would be able to try them all.  We were told to sit outside, even though we were early and there was available seating at the bar.  Well, unless you were seated directly at the tiny bar - about 5 or 6 seats on either side - there was no chance for any tastings, as anyone seated there got them all to themselves.  After a few pours, we indicated there seemed to be a situation and were told that no problem: continue sitting outside and they will soon be passing them around.  Didn't happen.  After about  1/2 way through, we realized we would not be partaking of any libations.  We indicated our displeasure, a refund was given, but we were definitely & hugely disappointed.  {We had about 3 other events we had been invited to on this same night, 1 being a free preview screening of a new movie, the other was a new restaurant much closer to home}, and needless to say we were bummed at missing out on better opportunities we had turned down.  Driving all the way here for what?  (Oh, any bar service was, of course, taking forever since it was full of bartenders for the event, so waiting for drinks in any way sucked all around).  I should point out that the manager very chivalrously proffered 2 signature Lemonade Cocktails upon overhearing our disappointing dilemma regarding the Martini Tastings.  I guess all was not lost, since Halo was across the street & I had been wanting to pop in there for a new custom jewelry piece for a piercing.    Overall, I seriously doubt I'd be back, considering how far from home this is, and all the other many alternates we passed on the way getting there.  But I would be ok with recommending it to someone who either lives nearby, driving past there anyhow, had something else to do in the area.  It is certainly an establishment which seems to be shiny and new in an area which is tired and drab.  Seems to be out of place where it is.  Would I go if it was located in say, Old Town?  maybe I'd give it 6 months before I thought about that. but maybe...

I never use the beds - only spray tans - (instant gratification)  Their Versa Spa Spray Tan Booth is awesome - i've tried quite a few - {they've all cloed down!} It does 6 passses, and after each time there's a dry pass - blow drys the spray on (ie: no getting on your clothes - well, i would suggest to still wear black to the salon).  OH, try the extra moisture mist on as the 7 & 8 pass - it really makes a difference!

Ooooo, pretty glasses.  And look at those plates.  Check out those really neat, ah, cool, um.... I think we need them - what are they?    If you are a Martha  Stewart wanna-be, the kitchen section has it all - and things even I haven't seen  (nay used).  Have to say, I never go upstairs - gave up that after several sticker shocks with the furniture - BUT I like all the nifty little things for the home.  Cuz we all need to replace those mugs, plates, wine glasses, vases - after the relatives need and there's a path of destruction left behind because they overstocked the cupboard and slammed the door on the china plates or dropped the martini glass (after 1, 2 or 3 too many) or attempted to place the wine glasses in the upside down wine glass holder - I am not sure WHY they can't figure out HOW easily they slide in.  I am prepared this time: I removed all my Reidel, and re-stocked my holders with target glasses.  Of course, now none will get broken since I did that.    But when the next smash and crash occurs, here is where I may come back to.

We've been going since day 1, when it was The Counter.  (liked it better interior-wise then, they had cool retail products).  Food has not changed.   Hot roast beef grilled snadwhich & tomato soup is the best.  Luv the chineese salad.   Tip: grap a bottle of (cheap) wine & they will crack it for you - no charge. (no one seems to know this?) Perfect Lunch spot, but the open for breakfast (oatmeal, eggs).  Coffee is 25 cents, btw.

Went to see The Tokens, who sang their signature song: The Lion Sleeps tonite.  They were funny, very interactive with the audience, and just a generally good show,    It was quite a drive from PV, not sure if I would go again?  I did not have the dinner menu - I've done dinner & a show kinda thing, not usually a good idea.  There are TONS of options around w/n walking distance.  The lounge?  MEH.  Had a fairly snotty waiter.  I ordered a "crisp, clean, NOT sweet" Rose, but he then returned and said it was not available, could he substitute another Rose?  I said as long as it was def. not sweet, he said indeed it wasn't.   Was the worst bottle of wine I've ever had.  (I know, I shoudl have sent it back, long story...)  Anyhow, the server at the show was amazing: fun, happy, quick, accomodating.  Little cheese cake lolli-pops were YUMMY !  So were the hand-cut potatoe chips with truffle dip.  Mmmmm :-)

OK, 1st of all, this is based only on happy hr @ the chef kitchen table.  Our 1st visit was a complete dinner servce, which was GR8, (just never wrote a rvw).  Service was prompt, fast, attentive. (served by hostess). They got her dirnk order twice, so they brought out 2nd martinis 'on the house'. (grey goose pear & gin blossom, both awesome :-)   The grilled artichokes were over-done, but had previously & they were out of this world. Try the smashed potatoes (gloified potatoe chips with rosemary - YUM).   Other than trying to give our seats (when leaving) to a couple with 2 very hungry & tired kids (who would have luved the busy kitchen view) & rudely turned us down, {dispite having a LONG wait ahead,} we had a fantastic visit - will definatley return, with OUR kids (at an apropiate time, not bed-time) AGAIN! THANX!!

Absolutly LUV the neighborhood nites special @ M&T - combine that with happy hour = an amazing deal, and a fabby nite out, GR8 drinks, good wines by the glass - o and did u know kids eat free 5-6 ?!?!  try and top that, i say!  1 of the best filets i've ever had.  YUM caprese salad!  I'll be back next week, i'm sure of it !  (after i vaccum out the cookie crumbs from the car because they hand you a fresh baked cookie upon leaving!)

Thank GOODNESS they finally started a HH!  It was getting insane to pay $18/martini - esp. in a group - and we were always paying!  This is the BEST little bar to start - or end - an perfect eve.  Want a fantastic & romantic sunset? Presto!  This is it.  Talk about "impress your passenger" with the amzaing drive up - they will wonder what you are "UP" to.  Valet is there in an instant to meet your needs.    I like walking down the steps, but instead of walking straight in, I detour to the right, which offers the pristine views.  You also can provide the option of "shall we sit out here, or in?"  The place is really small & intimate - in and out - so be prepared for that, as it can be quite popular.  I will absolutly be back - again.

I live around 6 blocks away & have never noticed! even driving by you will likely miss it: very tucked away, tiny & hidden.  Small & dark inside, little 'patio' sandwiched btwn 2 buildings.  Very limited wine choices. Seems to be a big draw with regards to staying open till 2am? (I must be old, not a selling point 4 me).  Staff & Owner very nice, but sorry, just no atmosphere happening here to entice me back?  All & all, no particular cons, nor any pros to rant nor rave about here.... sigh....

I'll never go back again! Not by choice - they will close their doors after Saturday :-(  We have gone here on an avg. of 1x/mth.  I will miss their bar & patio, as well and their unique hand-shaken infused & top-notch martinis.    It's unfortunate we won't be able to experience this hip, chic, high-end bar which had excellent service, GR8 food, and fantastic drinks.    The Prime Rib tonite was awesome, and so was the heirloom tomoatoe & mozzarella salad.    There's now no where to go for effen cherry vodka & fresh squeezed lemondae :-(    WhaaaaaaaaaaaaaH  ..........

Cute little shop if you are crafty &/or into beads.  Signed my daughter up for a class which involved making tiny seed bead rings.  Was a different craft to do & she has a 2 nice little keepsakes to say she made them all by herself.    They have all the tools for jewelry making, and everything from imported silver, glass, crystal, plastic, letters, charrms, leather, silk - the list goes on.  Quite a pricey investment at the end of the day to make your own item - just depends where your interests lie.

Have you tried their HAPPY HR yet?  The Ylang Ylang tini is awesome :-)  Tried thier 5 course lunch, everything was yummy: chicken on skewer, grilled asparagus, miso soup, salad, spicy beef, sliced pork, sticky rice, and they served the sherbert on a block of ice. (how "cool" is that?!).  We did run into same situation as rvw below - ordered edamame, they were out, ordered green tea, out, (?!) ordered saki, had to remind on 4th course.  waited forever for bill. (only 3 tables being served, lunch not busy at all). but the overall experience was great, but i like the happy hr @ the bar the best :-)

I'm so not a 'pub & grub' kinda gal, but since this place saved me 2 times during a Science Center visit = pretty ok.  You can walk across from AZ Science and make this kid friendly pit stop in the middle of the day - i really am not familiar with anything else that 'now it's the parents turn' sorta thing close by.  Fun pool table in 1 of the rooms.  Really good steak fries, fish and chips are good, and so is the french onion soup.  Since i am a wine drinker, this is not the place for wines by the glass, obviously it is a beer place, and me not being a beer drinker, not my cup of tea - ah~hem, pint that is....  sooo, all-n-all a fun thing to do after sacrificing for the kids!

Very cute place.  Perfect place to take your mom, (which i did while she was visiting from Canada, eh?).     Of couse you MUST do the high tea: consists of a awesome display of a large 3-tiered plated presentation of tiny goodies.  Little smoked salmon sandwiches, cucumber & cream cheese, scones, jam, tiny petite fours.  I love scones and clotted cream (devenshire) ours arrived with plain whip cream (totally disappointed).  Very unique place to take a guest, just hope your server is in a happier mood for you, otherwise would have given the extra star for star treatment :-)

ah.... NO.  if you want cheap crap, by all means, shop here.  For hard liquor, I have almost always and consistanly found stores like safeway less, (for their sales AND extra 10% off 6+ bottles).  Then they (BevMo) tells me, "well,"we'll match".....  (OK, why would I be here if I already didn't find {and buy} the discount items?)  For stoli, grey goose, pravda, chambord, saphire, ect., ect., ect. I find I almost always find those higher end items on sale PLUS 10% off at albersons or safeway.  For cheap wine, (and i mean cheap) especially buy 1-get-1 10 cents, go ahead (i'll serve that to my older relatives who are more than happy with it.  For the high end wine - OMG - they are 10-30% MORE than other places I've found. (ck out Phoenix wine, btw - across the street).  BTW, this is not based on just 1 visit - i live near-by & really try to support my local people, honestly.... but not to the point of getting ripped off!  They appar to have warehouse prices, but I have not found this to be true.  So of COURSE I will go aross the street to other more honest, happy, attentive and service orientated local business who puts a smile on their face when they see me.

Why O why did i return?!  MY BAD! I guess because (for some unknown reason Safeway stopped stocking infused vodkas such as Grey Goose Pear & Vanilla Stoili) and it is beside my regular pit stop: Fresh & Easy.   Well, I obtained my vodkas, and I thought, hey, looks like a wine tasting in the back.  Thought I should ck it out.  Well, in there tiny walled off area allowed for tasting, you could barely move to the actual tasting bar.  When you were able to 'belly up to the bar' it was treated with the arogant  demand of "I need to see your ID".  (Normally ok, but remember, it was crowded, people scrunching me on either side, I had 2 big bottles in my arms, my purse, and i had to dig for my wallet, balance it all and still navigate my DL out for a look. "KEN" proceeded to intently glare at my credentials for around 20 seconds, (all while i balanced my bottles, purse & wallet against a jostling crowd).  Get this:  as I put my DL back into my wallet, which went in my purse, my 'host' then haughtly said, "that will be $1 for the tasting".  (so not worth the trouble to find a bill for this at this juncture in time, lemme tell ya)... So i produce the stupid piece of tender & ask for a cab/sav.  (EW!!!!) I promptly dumped it.  Not too many other choices here, so i ask for the syrah, (gross - DUMP), promplty (attmpt - crowded, u know) walk out of there.  Well, at the very least, since i am in the back, (high end) wines, might as well find some of my favs... i go to 1 - a red blend $37 - now i get this for reg. price at Phoenix Wine, across the street, for $30, so like, um, no.  Same goes for several others: 25% less at Phoenix Wine.    I take my 2 bottle of vodka vowing never, ever to return - cuz why would i ???

A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.  Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles.   Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.    Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.  Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.    Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening.

Well, if you are a crafty sorta person, this is it.  (I, on the other hand, am really not).    So, you may ask, why the heck do I go here?  Lotsa reasons:  silk flowers (so, I  give up on real blooms - they just die - I plant these baby's instead - and they last - and you know what?  They don't need water, they don't wilt, no bugs, no weeds.)  Wrapping paper.  Photo Albums. Wedding favors.  Party Give-aways.  Pots.  Baskets.  Kids Crafts.  Spray Paint.  Frames.  And of course, this is a crafters heaven.... Maybe I need a real hobby - and when I do, this would be the place.  (until then, it works for the odds and ends around the house projects).  Oh, don't expect anything fancy here, or finding easy help - assistance is pretty rare, so you are pretty much on your own in your hunt for your art project.    (and don't forget to bring in your 40% coupon: found in every sunday paper)

Based only on 2nd level, lounge, bar & happy hr.  Free Appies, bought on platters, artfully arranged, (tiny prtions, keep in mind). Try the cheese fondue! YUM! Keeps 2 people going over glasses of wine just fine, thank you!  They did have certain bottles 1/2 off and other drinks were 1/2 off as well.  Views from patio balcony awesome!  I am not sure if 3rd level patio open yet or not, I want to ck that out, how culd the views get better? I guess from here!

For $5 you really get a sparkly car wash.  I have never once been disappointed.  Of course, you have other higher end options to chose from.  Sometimes you really don't have time to stand in the sun for 30 minutes waiting endlessly while you watch your car get patted down.  So this is a GR8 alternative to have a clean car in 5 minutes for $5 :-).    They have a fantastic deal happening rigt now: i think it's $20 for a full hand wax job - amazing - reminds me, I'm going to try that this afternoon :-)

O this was fun, unique, & informative! Good day trip/drive - who knew?! GR8 little caf/bistro Fun Tour - a must! Yummy samples (pick a bottle of wine of the shelf to have with your meal - shhh) AMAZING olive oils - take some home! (the truffle oil is to DIE 4!) Kids will enjoy as well. Little bit of picnic grounds near the olive orchard, btw. (cute)

In summer mths, usually here 1x/wk (1/2 off all bottles of wine).  Usually we sit at the bar, (faster service), but have sat outside, (people watching is pretty good), & inside (had a wierd waiter last several times, quirky).  Luv the wine list, good flat-bread pizzas, pasta yummy, amazing mozz/tomatoe bowl.

Now how did this slip by?  been here over 20 times, not sure why/how i missed writing about it - i would suppose it's not exactly 'up there' & 'all that', nor really not bad either.  The major saving grace here would be there comfy patio: ESPECIALLY if you snag a sofa.  And it's not one of those patios facing a road - it actually has grass, birds, fountains.... {o, um, ok: alot of kids playing in the water ---- but the peals of laughter still better than traffic}.  Their HH is awesome: 1/2 off all bottles of wine - by glass or bottle - and that goes down quite well in my books - thank. you. very. much.  a few yummy appies at GR8 prices.  luv the angel hair pasta with basil & tomatoe sauce - i add chicken.  i know which waitress will be a relaxing experiencing - and which one, (when she walks toward me i go - o no.... please no...) will not be so fabby... (i had her today) ah well.....  add the bottle of wine, rose coloured glasses, our temps, the sunshine, and thinking of all my relatives back east who still have another mth or so to enjoy patio life - and guess what?   it's all good......

Great sexy décor throughout.  Reminded me of a boudoir theme, with crystal chandeliers, black velvet wallpaper with soft pink background, sweeping Scarlet O'Hara curved staircase  which dominates the middle of the salon.    Autumn, 1 of their top stylists, proceeded to listen intently to my hair history, gave some advice, and we were at it within minutes.  The 2 colors she added to my hair in several sections of foils, were done in an extremely efficient manner, with her trusty assistant helping throughout the procedure.    As a client, I was treated in a very professional manner from the moment of walking into the doors, throughout the color processing, to the shampoo, rinse & styling steps.  {Although I didn't particularly like the fact that, as your proceed to the reception desk to settle up, there's a leather box filled with your bill, along with several products "hand-picked" and highly suggested by your stylist to purchase}.  I just immediately said I was not interested in any items, since I have 2 bathrooms totally overflowing with everything from conditioners, mud, wax, gel, whips, sprays, of every brand and consistently known to most hair salons!    Overall, I was pleased with the entire experience, so yes, I will return for at least a 2nd treatment.  I hope they serve wine by then - Hint~Hint !

Ok, so why the heck have I not been here sooner?! (bad llama - ok, if u didn't see the movie emperor's new groove, never mind - and I'm off the subject matter here...)  Sat at the nice & spacious bar where we were (ok, that looks weird: a lot of 'w' & 'e's) very promptly served and waited on for over an hour.    The steak flatbread was awesome!  Nom~Nom~Nom.  Paired with the perfect glass of cab: sequoia grove - Mmmmmmmm I will definitely be back.

I don't think it is my imagination.  Their policies seemed to have changed slightly.  I am happy to report it "appears" things are a lot better here for our furry friends.  Out of all the animals, they seem mostly 'taken'.  Either adopted, or still in people waiting mode (still rated stray and awaiting their owner).  I also saw several signs of "dog of the day, $36, take me home today".  (Although, I always thought their adoption fees were hefty -dogs $60(older dog) -100 and  $150 for purebred or toy dog!  Or $50-150 for a cat!) and the 'pay now, come back tomorrow to take home' annoying.    There were a ton of pitt bulls (natch) that appeared to have a bright future, since many had 'adopted' on their cage.  They were all friendly, tail-wagging, licky things. (must have been around 70).    For so little you get so much - so save a life.  Since this is a kill shelter, these furry friends usually don't have a lot of time to sit and wait around for you to pick your life long comapion - they can bring so much joy & happiness to your life !

Everything about this theatre is crisp and clean & very well presented.  They was not 1 thing out of place: from the ticket sales area, to the front entrance & lobby, and the bar area.  (Should have more seating for waiting before the show and to have drinks at.)  Inside the theatre, the seating at the tables was set-up to a "T".  Nothing was out of place, and all the tables were perfecting set.  Our sever was extremely attentive and was great about answering any questions we had in regards to the menu, food, and wine.  The 1 order of chicken tasted pretty weird, but my prime rib was good, as well as the order of short ribs.  Bread basket was nice and hot.  Kids liked the chocolate  fondue with fruit.  It was my mistake for not reading the description of the production we saw to be better informed that is was not the broadway show of Phantom of the Opera, rather it was just "Phantom" we saw.  None of the known broadway songs in the original play from Andrew Llyod Weber were sung.  Although this is based from the same book, I, as well as others around me, we quite disappointed that the smash-hit we were used to and loved was not the same.  The stage sets, costumes, make-up and effects were all good for the venue.  I guess I was just expecting the same play in which I had seen on broadway previously.  It was still an overall good experience.

Completely. Totally. Utterly - UN-impressed.   I am not going to bother to nit-pick my lame experience through 5 'courses' (yes, 1 of them on a tiny spoon - maybe we took Thumbelina's table).    Salad: "OK" Steak: CHEWY (spat out several pieces - gross, i know) (with hash browns for DINNER?!?!)  sourdough bread served with olive Oil (!?!) combined taste = acidic smurf blue cotton candy  (WTH?!?!)  1 star for a yummy dessert - but by then i was pissed off, so it only counts to actually write and insert this reveiw!  ended up a pissy nite with us blaming each other who's stupid idea it was to choice to waste our nite (and MOOLA !!) here.

Lounge is sexy, luv sitting & eating at the kitchen table.  Very amusing to watch all the chefs hard at work.  Red Pepper soup was good, pizzas are to die for.  Luv the wines by the glass selection, and the happy hour ROCKS :-)

I wish there were  1/2 stars for ratings - I would give 3.5.  (bumped up to a 4 to support local business).    A 45min drive for a tour that was less than - I think it was about 30 mins.  And it didn't even include watching any milking or the making or any dairy products at all??  A tractor took us up and down the rows of cows, while giving a description of their keep, instruction of their care, information on their lifespan & day-to-day life.  you could try some milk afterwards (yippee) for an additional $1 to the $7.50 tour price.   I did want to support the farm further, and did so by purchasing products such as milk, cream, butter and cheese.    I guess I would (sorta) recommend it, it is fun and informative for the kiddies.  But I would only do something like this like once/yr (ie: queen creek olive mill).

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!  you guys know how to throw a party!!  Everything was perfect: the setting, the patio, amazing & attentive servers, speedy bartenders, absolutly fantastic food!  (cept i am not sure why everyone says those pop-overs are to die over?  they are just yorkshire pudding things - sheesh!).    Steak was YUM!  creamy potaotes (could have eaten a bowl full) were amazing.  and you had (1 of) my favorites cabs!  (ZD - Mmmmmm).  Talk about a perfect evening with a gorgeous setting - thank you!

Attended an amazing event in which Dr. Andrew Weil hosted and provided a wealth of fantastic information pertaining to diet, health and cooking.  I really hope something else along these lines might be presented again.    Luved all the samples of the new menu, which included smoothies, tofu breakfast wrap (surprisingly good!) pistachio loaf, yummy pancakes, and yummy granola & greek yogurt.    I appreciate that all their ingredients are upheld in very high standards, and they are being recognized all over, hence opening in other locations such as Scottsdale Quarter (will be much closer for me to visit) and in California.

Do you kow that last week they had bottles of wine for $1.99?  Now, let me tell you, I was beyond Skeptical.  (being the wine snob that I am).  But then I thought, well we do  get a lot of visitors who either don't care what we serve  or don't appreciate the $20/30/40 dollar bottles I like, so why waste them?  So, I got about 5 cases or red & white.  That was my biggest deal of the year.  (I'm just mad I didn't buy more and it's all gone now - the store, that is!)  Fantastic place to pick up an instant picnic!   Pita Puffs?!  I can scarf down a bag in 2 sittings.   Coffee Beans? Can you say Organic & Free Trade?  Chicken skewers? Fastest little meal to BBQ on earth.    French Thin-Crust Pizza with ham and Brie?  (OMG)  Luv their imported things Moroccan Rosemary Almonds.  Lemon Pepper in its own cute little grinder?  Can't do without it.  Dim Sum - Fabby little snack ready in minutes, like their edamame & pot stickers.

At least I finally went and have a review written before it hits 100.  Some things just take time.    That said, we attended the Pig Roast on a Sunday Afternoon.  The pork was really tender.  The little tortillas we so cute!  Loved all the little itty bitty condiments to daintily spoon on your mini tacos.  It was fun to do as something different and out of the ordinary.  As a huge bonus, wine by the bottle was  1/2 price!!  Who~Hoo!!  Loved the sexy & romantic décor.  Nice and cozy, just right (as Goldilocks said).  Their brunch menu looks cool, but I am not big into breakfast.  The regular menu prices did seem fairly high, so I am not sure I would come back for Din~Dins, but I would love to re-visit, and sit at the intimate bar for a Sunday where there is drink specials and of course to take advantage of their fabby wine prices.

Ooo~Ooo - pick me - i want to be review # 100 - that's a nice rounded number, for a bar which rounded out my otherwise not-so-fabby night downtown.  Not being a frequent patron of the downtown environment, it was interesting to pound the pavement previous to a broadway show, scouting out for a chic wine or martini bar.  I wanted to find a place close to the Herberger Theatre - you know: since parking is the cost of a martini!   Also, since I luv my red wine, I needed a good wine-by-the-glass list, (whch, considering how many sports bars i passed on the way.... pickings seemed slim...) and hubby luvs the dirty tini, hence a wine/martini bar a looking we went.  Some healthy, non-fried snacks would be nice by now too :-)  I'm happy to report that this establishment fit the bill on all accounts.  The décor is sexy, sleek, and urban cool.  Everyone was dressed in office attire of suits, dresses or shirt & ties.  Sitting at the bar, it was good to see it only took a quick glance at the easily read menu to make a prompt decision.  The menu is great for making a fast and easy choice for a mixed drink, martini, white or red wine by the glass, and appetizers picks that were decipherable, (ie: nothing making you need to ask "what the heck is this?").  Our bartender was exceptionally efficient with serving, as well as understanding we were in for a quick nip, and needing to dash as soon as we enjoyed our drinks & a great little bar plate of pistachios, olives, salami, prosciutto, ciabatta and parmesan.    Thanx for a good start to our evening, even though the show we saw sucked.... ah, well... c'est la vie - Not your fault Hanny's !

Only had a short time & wanted a good drink on a nice patio after shopping desert ridge (and did NOT want any of the places there).  So, went staight to the patio bar - bar is sexy & posh & elegant.  Patio quite nice, even though only a few feet from street - not busy so it was fine).  Cool sofas to relax in & the ambiance of the glass fire pits were neat.  BEST martini with fresh fruit & champange - shaken at the table - luv that.  (FYI - this place is very pricey, just be warned! (not sure I'l lbe back for $$$$$ dinner).  But i would definatley stop in again for a tini (or 2).

I actually went to the Joya Salon, which is attached to the Spa.  So I think this counts?    Excellent Manicure, Martinis served off the salon in a cute litte private patio (bonus!).  Had shampoo, Blow-Out & Style - Totally Awsome.  I will be back.  Great experience, GR8 ambiance,  Good treatment.  Walking the grounds after was really fabby, and so was the louge bar happy hour afterwards.  Very serene outside seating.     Ahhhhhh :-)

"Heaven - I'm in Heaven.." You know that tune? Fits perfectly with your experience here.  Did a couples massage - THE BEST - and I've had (Ah~Hem) quite a few all over.   The Ambiance, the setting, the treatement, the room, the amenities - off the charts!    This resort provides the best before & after options of ANY place I've ever had: from the private pool deck, co-ed whisper quiet lounge, {complete with beds surrounded with gauze & dozens of candle}s, to usage of the full fitness facilities and main pool & hot tub,3rd adult pool,  steam room & jacuzzi - I think i may be missing several other niches - like walking the pathways, riding the resort bikes through the grounds, OH!  and they offer amazing free child care, chalk-full of activities!   so make sure you make a day of it - or at the minimum half day to totally R-E-L-A-X and take it all in.  BREATHE :-)

I have visited the grounds on about a dzn occasions.  They really offer alot to locals, (moi).  {See Jaqequeline H. rvw which goes into depth of happy hours, ect}.  FINALLY stayed here last wknd.  Summer rates are $125 with a $50 resort credit (quickly used on the Thursday Spa Special: Martini, Manicure, Hair Wash, Set & Styled $40).  Kids Club is awesome.  Borrow the bikes and ride around the property to get a good look at it, otherwise it's ALOT of walking.  (and you should see it all!  beautiful).  I think i had the room with the BESTEST view!  (pic on their brochures, actually).    Service at front desk prompt, efficient, curitous & professional.  (for some reason, I had a bottle of champange & chocolate covered strawberries in my room?!  YUM :-)  i took it and didnt' dare ask any questions!  lol  Fitness facilities amazing.    Luv the reasonable Crave Cafe for quick munchies, breakfast, bottles of wine, doggie treats.  The only problem I had was the hidden cost of a $25 resort fee which was tacked on and never indicated anywhere at any time to me apon booking, checking in - just appeared on my bill -  Grrrrr.

If you are passing by the area (and only "if") definately stop in.  I live no where near this locale, so i am not sure i'll be back, but it was nice to be invited to their anniversary party.  A little tricky to find, blink and you will miss the hidden door!  Has a jazzy-blues feel to it.  Nice comfy seating on sofas.  Place is not too big nor too small.  Good seating along the bar or across it on high-boy tables.  Service was prompt and efficient.  Their specialty cocktails were really nothing that i would normally pick.  But, the retro martini with champange in it was pretty refreshing.  I also tried a cucumber tini with mint i think.  was different.  Again, thanks for the party invite.  Was fun & different.

I had this on my list for so long!  Looked so cute!  What was with my luck tonite?!  This place, then C4 down the street?  WHY DID I DRIVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE?!  We walk inside, cute & tiny.  No one else  but us.  We sat at the bar and were attentively and promplty served by such a nice girl.  (That's were this "1 star" comes from.)  Had a nice glass of wine, but within minutes my eyes were stinging.  I had thought, is it my makeup?!  I never said anything, but eventually my husband's eyes were streaming and he said his eyes were driving him nuts!  The server noticed and said, yes, it is the cook prepping oinions and garlic for the night?  (as i said, tiny place, kitchen inches from behind the bar).  We moved to the furthest corner, still did not help.  There is a small front patio, which i asked hubby to ck, but it was a last ditch effort to go  out since it was well over 100 degrees.  As he peeped out, the owner (?  appeared as such) who was seated outside said, "O, is it the onions bothering you?  I can certainly smell them out here!"    Anyhow, we did move outside.  Our eyes burning the entire time.  My makeup in ruins.  Eyes bloodshot.  NOT FUN!  Footnote to the owner: Prep at a different time when customers are not present!!!!  ie: night before !!!!  or invest in a new exhaust system !

The views!  Totally amazing views!  Whoa!  Perfect place for a drink as the sun sets, o ya.  Chicken samosas with curried yogurt dip?  Yummers!  Sweet Corn Ravioli with basil butter?!  O.M.G.  Did I mention the fabby zen-like views? O, I think I did.... ok, I am so going back - for the ravioli, I am so craving that.   Right.   Now.

This is such a cool cafe, with tiny wine tastings, GR8 little gifts, coffee & snacks.  Since there is nothing quite like it for miles, it's a great ride on the (motor) bike for us.  Both staff members we very nice, even though it was very late & i think they wanted to close, but tried hard not to indicate that.  Try their yummy gelato samples :-)  Nice little find, and make sure to ck out the gorgeous grounds of this amazing resort - W O W.

Ok, so I held off writing a review here from my 1st visit, which was when they were brand new, about a year ago.  It has definitely remained exactly the same.    I was out for a date night on the 1st time around, and wouldn't you know it?   Loud, obnoxious, rowdy, big group, who were not only inebriated from the previous ball game which they just crawled off a bus from, but continued to drink their heads off with regular spurts of raucous laughter.  It got even worse, as they then celebrated a birthday in the group.  moving onward...  You seriously have to gawk at the likes at what constantly walks in here.    January....  I mean, I was sitting outside on the beautiful patio next door at Ocean Prime, and my teenager couldn't help but roll his eyes in disgust at what the 50 year old ma'ams (or is it Madames?) and the get-ups (or lack of them).  Looked like freaky muppets with all that hair, googly eyes, big lips, plastic-y, and other extraordinary cartoonish characteristics.    TIme MARCH-es on  So, on yet another date night, I go to head to the sexy patio at Ocean Prime, but it was closed off due to wind.  SO I groaned and thought, ok, we'll ck out the next outdoor establishment, since it seemed pretty quiet - shock.    After sitting down, it didn't take long to realize that I felt unclean, got the creeps and thought how trashy this and the patrons in it were.  To top it off, I didn't see any wines by the glass.    I'm otta here.    We quickly made a dash to the swanky & very classy  indoor bar area of Ocean Prime.  Had an amazing glass of red wine.  Nice music.  Sexy décor.  Everything was good.  The earth was set back into it's perfect rotation.

I was so disappointed that Dish closed - we were there 2x's/wk.  I was very hesitant to try The Kitchen, even though I live right near-by & driving by, looking it, appeared the same, (which is basically is).  Went for their free wine tasting Wed eve.  (pours were extremely tiny, 1oz) and I'm not a fan of spanish wines (my problem), so I was happy to pick a bottle off the shelf in the wine section & waiter was more than happy to un-cork it for me - for a fee, of course.  (I think $9 is a bit steep, should be more like $4/5).  But it was a good bottle, great entertainer singing, comfy sofa, yummy bruschetta.    Ok, now I'm hungry all over again, I think I'll slip over there & ck out what's on their lunch menu :-)   {besides, I'm out of cream for coffee in the am & they actually have half & half in glass bottles which has thick cream on top}  - MMmmmm :-)

I love these trails.  Because there are so many options, you can stream-line a hike suited just for you.  Flat, hills, windy trails, far, long, short, loop, line, ect.    Almost all the trails allow dogs (Yai ) on a leash, of course. (much appreciated, for those with dogs on leash, {me}  and esepcially for those who don't like dogs running at them).    Several difficulty levels & lengths.  Such a good work-out!  All ages.    I love the loop trails because i can usually go for an entire hour and rarely run into anyone (another Yai ! here).  I think some of my fav loops are Yates & Quartz.  Happy Hiking!

wow - ever since the opened around 6 months ago, I've been a fan. I visit sometimes every day (at times, twice a day), but generally 3 times/wk.  Love their pre-prepared foods: fresh, great ingredients, ready to eat. Lunch-to-go - wow - yummy Bakery items such as bread and cakes are good Some pretty ok wines (I prefer the higher end, but stock up on the others for those who visit and implore MORE of what I just gave them). Beer: Torino - I don't drink/like beer but tried this and it is good! (i would compare it to corona). Half the price, btw !!!  Overall, interesting, fun, yummy, food, many hormone free, organic items, and deli items, as well as "AJ" type things (humus, dips, salsa, ect), for WAY less.  I'm happy :-)

You guys are GR8 & u really try.  (Luv the new decor & renovations, btw).  I am sorry,  I cannot recall everyone's name, but Scott in Wine & Liquors always so bery helpful.  Gary in Meat  never misses an opportunity to shout to customers (from behind the meat counter) HOW ARE YOU! can I help with anything?!  They guys in produce, the check-out, the baggers. (Did I mention other staff members find & seek you, ask if you need anything, and when you do will actually WALK you to what you are looking for? ie: marshmellows, they r hard to find!! so they don't just go, "o asile 15, or possibly 13... last i ch'd")   I will have to make a mental note & recall specific names to re-write this review & give thanks to those specifiaclly deserving.     BTW, no one has dry ice - these guys do!! (very handy for fun, martinis, pool parties :-)

Rain Massage - ever had 1??  This is the 2nd time I've taken advantage  the couples massage room :-)    The Rain Massage was unique - using rain sticks as background sounds, as well as smaller rain sticks utilized for massaging during the massage.  If you are bored with 'regular' massages, this is a cool alternative to try - espcially together.  FYI - with any/all spa treaments, you have use of the rest of the facilites: work-out room, pilates & yoga classes, adult pool, steam room, jacuzzi, ect.  This is located in the Westin Kierland Resort.

WOW - much better location, space, decor - BIG improvement over last space.  (Now located in the safeway parking lot, beside devil's martini).  GR8 wine selection .... actualy TOO GR8: some VERY HIGH END wines - scary.  Sales staff were quite helpful in picking new selections for my taste preference.  Bistro area cozy, well appointed. On Monday, not only can u purchase a bottle at a case price discount, BUT no corkage fee either!! WOW.  Really good appies.  Ck out their montly calander of events for specials, discounts,happy hours, tastings, ect.

So why did it take me so long to visit this resort around the corner from me?!  Talk about romantic and beautiful grounds!  The bar spills out onto a gorgeous courtyard, complete with awesome mountain views and fabby fountain.    Fantastic service, very ZEN, and prompt bartending!  Their cocktails are mostly all unique and fun.  Great wines by the glass & YUMMY appies!    They have an amazing Happy Hour - i am sooo going back asap!

Sexy, Chic, Hip.  Patio feels like 5th floor roof-top hotel.  GR8 DJ: spinned tunes of Hot Top 40 MIx.  Excellent sound system.  (no bass rumblings).  Dance Floor styled around a high stone fireplace with a mansion feel, set under a gigantic modern & unqiue chandelier:  Anyone who used to frequent Devil's Martini around the corner will luv this change to hit the nite scene :-)  I'm anticipating the start of the food menu which starts in 2 weeks from a fabby high-end chef from PV resort.  Will definately be back on a regular basis, especially since it is so close and Devil's Martini has gone to CRAP with new management.  Open Thur, Fri, Sat eves.  Happy Hour Specials, VIP areas, Bottle Service, Dance, Garden Patio, Indoor/Outdoor Bar.

I feel sorry for these guys.  It's not their fault.  Half the Borgotta is shut-down.  Retailers gone.  It's practically a ghost town here.   Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.  Shame that they (Borgota/Westcor) don't appear to want to work with the local retailers, because this place used to be pretty unique and special, where I'd bring any visitors to - not anymore.

WOW! no full parking lot, lots of spaces available (like, since when?!), no line up going in, and guess what (no way!) only 1 cart in front of us at check-out!  (bonus).  All the shelves fully & neatly stocked.  Gas was about 20 cents less than all other contenders.   So glad the mayhem at other costco @ Raintree is a thing of the past - ugh!  This visit was actually pleasant.    (footnote: where the heck was the samples??)

This establishment has been on my list so long, that even as soon as I heard they were scouting for a spot to obtain for expanding their chain here in Scottsdale, I signed up for their email alerts and progress. It just so happened that opening night I was actually away in Cost Rica.  For some unknown reason, it took until now to visit.  (So many places, so little time...)  Wednesday nights provides fantastic specials of  1/2 off everything, from what I recall.  Britney, our server, was always around at the right time.  It seemed she had over a dozen tables, yet appeared promptly when we looked like we might have a question, or when we were considering another order.    The stage never stopped with entertainment for even a minute.  There was always at least 1 musician playing or singing, usually in tandem with pianos, hence (obviously) their term of Dueling Pianos, of course.  Several times there was 3 and even 4 performers on instruments of guitar, horn, or drums.    I thought it was a great change, out of the ordinary, and a lot of fun.  I already have a list of people I want to bring, especially since I have visitors coming in March and April who I know would enjoy visiting and seeing such a spectacle.

Really Hip n Happen'n Bar.    Different & Interesting Drink List -  Lavender Infused Organic Vodka with Candied Petals?   Lemonade, Organic Vodka & Muddled Basil?   Wow, sure, I'll try that too!  (I do like them crisp and clean, so i prefer w/o any 'simple syrup' concoction they add to them all - way too sweet - but that's up to you and your taste.)  also thought the wine tasting - 3 pours of either a flight of red or white - was really cool and a good way to try wines I would not normally shell out for a ful glass or bottle.  Luved the bar bites sharing plates - totally YUM!  wow!  Duck, pork, turkey meatballs, tomotoe soup shooters, i forget what else, but i do intend to go back and try some more - they were excellent.  I did find it strange that along the bar, in the middle, they had this lower seating area, which was really weird - for wheelchairs?  it was strange looking down at people who kept sitting there.  They were introducing new menus and wine lists, so memorial wknd was super duper busy, which meant our service was not very prompt, but i can tell it was just one of those nites where it was out of the ordinary - there general standards look way above the normal, so i would like to visit again when it isn't as crazy there.

After our horrible experience across the street @ Urban 7 (ie: NOT reccommended!) our little eyes spot this very cute & cozy spot as we walk out and over to our car.  Hmmmm, this place has been here before, hasn't it?  It seemed familar yet different.  A romantic and cozy patio, complete with white tableclothes, and little lights.  We walk into the salon, (which had really cool products and gifts for purchase as you walk in), and we were promplty greeted by a girl behind the salon counter.  We wanted to inquire about the menu & wine tasting. We were nicely pointed in the direction of 2 very hard working and busy chefs.   We were informed by the 2 chefs, who promptly stopped their prepping to eargerly talk to us, that wednesday evenings were wine tasting nights, and yes, they had a representative from a Cali Winery in attendance, as well as providing a little buffet of appies.    Now, this place is extremely inviting, warm & friendly, (we needed to so get over the nastiness from 7 we just came from - this was NICE - "hey 7, did you hear that?  be NICE")  I am awaiting their email invites for what they are excitedly putting toegether, as they have only been open just over 1 mth.  I did not partake of this wine event, but i certainly can't wait to see what other offereings they might have in the future!  (did i mention how nice and attentive everyone was here??? Hellllooo!)

WOW, talk about roll out the red carpet!  How can you resist shopping with a glass of wine in hand?

Topping it all off was visiting Fred's for tinis afterward :-)  (see my other review for that)

Shop. Sip. Savor.  What a concept!  After an exhuasting day of shopping, what a perfect thing to do is slip right into Fred's, located on the 2nd floor of Barney's.  Sexy Bar area with dark lighting.  All the service, from the moment we entered, to being seated, to drink & food orders, was impecable.  Racheal, the Assistant GM, came over several times to inquire how things were tasting, gave personal suggestions, tips & insider info.  Richie, the bartender, shook the perfect martinis.  We tried new Sobieske Vodka, (smooooth), his special signature Pomegrante Drop, (sugared rim), French Manicure (only for those who like them sweet), and the man drink: 007, (grey goose, Tanqueray, blue cheese stuffed olives).  The pomme frites we presented in a tall glass wrapped in parchment paper & served with 3 sauces for dipping.  (i much rather fries from Burbon Steak, or the garlic truffle fries at Greenhouse).  These were more like large steak fries.  But, still good & hot.  Emilia Romagna White Pizza with 12 year old Balsamic glaze was pretty ok.  I would have preferred a thinner crust.  Was a bit dry from  too much parmasean.  My 5 stars are obvisouly based on the awesome attention we recieved, treated with the ut-most respect (HTF), and service from days gone by!  I will denfinatley be back for their AMAZING HAPPY HOUR which is EVERYDAY, 4-7.

$5 glasses of wine from the WHOLE menu, ALL day till 6?!  r u kidding me??  Ya, baby!  Bring it on!    I am so coming back to try the happy hour, so yes, they have even better deals, can you believe it?  I am really starting to think Gabby & I are leaving each other scent trails that we are picking up on each other within days of stepping into joints - or is it just me?  I had just seen her hosting the kids booth at the Old Town Farmer's Market, and afterwards was driving around on this beautiful Saturday Afternoon, (drop-top-down), and spied this cute place.    Service was immediate, courteous & attentive.  Our waiter went out of his way to serve us.  Scott, the manager, even came over to make introductions, introduce himself and chat us up.    Service with a smile, all around!

Carmen, you have a magic wand.   Your bedside manner is hysterical.   You are up on all the newest technology.   The best laser prices in Scottsdale - maybe AZ?  USA? CK out their monthly specials on top of their fabulous prices. Can't wait for my next painless procedure - 1 more step to never using a razor 'down there' again !

This was so funky, that when I saw a picture of this salon in Foothills Magazine, I had thought it was a new bar/lounge!  Extra chic, sexy, top-notch and cutting edge.  This is the 1st boutique of many slated for across USA.  It was great to have everyone speaking fluent english for a change.  Everything is gleaming, sparkling, new, fresh and unique.  Beautifully decorated.  Service is given like you were in a 5-star resort.  Pick of nail colours were beyond the colors of the rainbow.  And get this:  would you like a glass of wine?  sure, fill 'er up!  No kidding!  What more could you want?  My husband and I totally loved our Saturday chill'n in here.  It takes alot to get him into Man-grooming, and this decor was perfectly suited to the male ego.  I am just considering their membership which offers alot of incentives, VIP treament, gifts, and discounts.  I'l lbe back, no matter if i sign up or not.  No hard sell tactics needed or given - I definatley like that!

Pedicure chairs extremely uncomfortable.  No massage and no jetted water for the tootsies - it's a glass bowl.  Manicure "Bar" area is also not comfortable: too wide, it's hard not to strain.  1st visit entailed a really bad French manicure: I noticed the top UV protect coat was super thick and gooey.  Got home and it was all bubbled & the white tips had all had hairline cracks underneath.  Went back next day to show them & they agreed & quickly realised that batch was bad and did a re-do.  Waited about 6 mos to go back.   Hubby got mani/pedi but his results on his feet were not up to standards: still rough spots, and his hands had several picky skin areas around the cuticles.  He was not happy, which makes it more difficult to drag him to another MAN-icure in the future - sigh.  I got a rockstar gel manicure & it was this thickest crap I've had.  (even the nail tech was not comfortable using the product at hand).  The Corporate Manager (?) called me due to my note of complaint, and offered a re-do as well as a brow wax (as I write this, their offer is still posted up top here on Yelp: FREE BROW WAX WITH MANI/PEDI).  The girl (esthetician) was not in the day of my treatment, so it was indicated to me I could book & come back another time.  Not so, said the very rude manager upon ck-out (hence my note to H.O. where they later honored the offer).  I returned for the brow wax, and at the end, Miss Manners (Mngr) again gives me an attitude and asks me to pay.  I calmly indicate the above and that it was offered to me, yadda, yada. After over 10 minutes, finally she agrees that there is a notation of no charge!  (groan).  I then proceed to book my gel manicure RE-DO, and she insists my existing job is fine and I don't need it. I  said to her I desire an appointment and it was offered to me to correct the situation, so please book me.  Well, I return, I get my gel mani re-done. I ask the technician if there was time to do my toes, yes, no problem.  So, now I know there will be a charge for my toes - no problem-o, of course!!  I get to the front desk - the charge?  Almost $100 !!!!  so I calmly say, I think there may be a bit of a mistake, blah, blah.  Miss Manners is summoned.  Well, the worst "mother-of-all" attitude assaults me.  I told her to please not treat me like this and that this was unacceptable and that she should cease the path she was pursuing -nothing happening.  She continued her verbal onslaught of vicious abuse to me and the supposed trouble I have caused in all the past (Like this is all my fault??? The cracked white tips?  Thick nails? Their ad for free brow wax then retracted?  okaaaay )  Since 3 new customers had entered behind me, and due to her escalating high voice, I simply, but very firmly (and in a very professional & mature manner) looked at her and told her to have the original Corporate Manager to contact me immediately as I would not deal with her, whereupon she yelled at out to me not to dare leave the shop without paying.  (Like that was real professional, considering it was me who kept the cool and not the actual shop "manager" ?  like where did they get this person from?  Do they want her to run them into the ground?  So it would seem!  She's doing a top-notch job in THAT direction, btw)  I would never go back, and never recommend this concept to anyone.  You absolutely do not get what you pay for.  A mani/pedi here is in no way worth $60 at all.  The experience is not comfy, and the unprofessionalism displayed by not just the so-called chick in charge, but also her counter-part, who also chimed in with trying to talk me out of what was already confirmed with me by their superior.  I mean, seriously??!! Who needs this?

1 week later, my skin is still in shock, flaking, peeling.  I purchased the combined treament of a Signature Pumpkin Orange Peel and Micro-Derm Skin Spatula procedure. I guess I must have mis-read the details, because I thought I was going to get a Micro-Derm - you know? the kind that feels like sanblasting, but with crystals??    Well, this was nothing like that!  Guess what?  my face was scraped with a surgical steel blade!  ya, i was pretty shocked, (and scared to move a muscle).    The rest of the facial massage, creams, pumpkin peel, ect. was all fine.    The 1st day or 2, my skin was pretty much on strike (normal for agravating the first 1 or 2 layers), but on the 3rd & 4th day, my face actualy had scratch marks on it, like I had been literally scratching my face with sharp nails.    I have had many facials & micr-derms preciously, but never, ever had scrapes on my face, so much flaking, nor peeling.  I have been using serums, creams, lotions, and calming toners to try to settle and address all the trauma, but i guess it will just take so more time.  Nichole, (the owner), was very nice, and kudos to her for owning a business at such a young age, but I can't say that I have a desire to go back, and i definately could never reccomend a facial with a surgial blade to anyone.  I just wish i had the regular micro-derm I've had in the past, and with good results.

Sexy. Sleek. Shiny. Chic.  Top~Notch Bar & Club.  Good Vibes, Great Service, Good Location.   Located in the space which was Six Lounge, 1 of the original owners decided to update & remodel & improve everything he loved about Six.   I'm not sure if I agree to the advertisement that the theme is  Western-Chic, sleek-Saloon for Urban Cowboys.  I find the décor is minimalist design, with ultra-modern lay-out very sexy with warm earth tones throughout.    A large tower houses the live DJ booth, golden framed flat screen TV's over the main bar, funky textures cover the bar stools, booths, and long wall sofa bench.    Lindsay, thank you for being our bartender & server.  Your attentiveness was great, much appreciated, esp. considering how busy it got.  .  No food service, no drink menu as of yet, TBA.  Beer, Champagne Splits, regular pours of spirits such as Skky, Absolute, and higher end like Grey Goose, Stoli and Belvedere.  Bottle service is $275. Since I am a big wine drinker, I await to see what may appear (if any) as to a wine list and any drink specials.  Overall, was a fun evening for an opening night.

I would have to agree 100% with previous rvw from Brian: I don't see this lasting into the summer.  For some reason, yesterday there was another rvw with a 1star, which is now missing????  anyhow, We also saw many of the staff standing around together and chatting.  We found the whole vibe to emit very strange & weird "somethings-just-not-right" kinda thing,  and just overall we too were uncomfortable - no Zen aspect whatsoever.  It didn't help matters at all that our bartender did not have on his hospitality hat.  I found him condescending & arrogant, not friendly and frankly fairly rude.    There is an extensive martini list, which, with all the advertising I had heard & read about, seemed to have been a draw for me to check it out.  They all use different ingredients & tend to lean towards sweet (grenadine, curacao, ect.  BLECK).  OK, so that is just my opinion, I know (I like em crisp n clean).  So I was interested  in the new vodka names which were unfamiliar to me.    1 drink had lychee in it, so I inquired, "was that a lychee infused vodka?"   (many of their martinis do not indicate the base: vodka, tequila, gin??).    The reply was a taunt "Lychee is a Chinese fruit".    "Um, ok, yes I know what it is, I eat them all the time, they have a red shell and white inside.  My question was, is that the vodka?"    Another terse reply, "well, I infuse it myself, it's a spirit.".    OK, this is not going well.    So I ask about another concoction, I think it was made with Primavera Vanilla? (Or  brand which began with "P")    So I asked "was that a vodka?"    Once again he basically avoided answering by saying something irritating like, well there's 4 different flavors, or you can get it plain.  I'm like ? ! ? ! ? ! ?     I was nowhere nearer to being educated on their very confusing ingredients.    I thought the way to get around it was to ask for vodka straight up.  I saw they had Effen Black Cherry (totally awesome infused vodka, btw).  That's pretty simple, correct me if im wrong?  But he stands there, with an idiot face, and i felt the vibe of he wanted to argue with me and couldn't believe he has to lower himself to do this task?  Now, again, I'll point out, this was a very simple task:  grab the vodka bottle,  pour it into a shaker with lots of ice,  shake it,  pour it,  serve it.   This couldn't possibly go wrong, right?   Guess what?   It arrives and I sip it - well for some unknown reason he took it upon himself to add water, yes, water it down!  Nice!!  This is really irritating me, because not only was mine watered down, (who does that?!) so was hubby's  tini with way too much soda.  Yes the description indicated a splash of soda, but I would guess it was 50% of the 4oz pour - unacceptable.  I should also point out that I too saw the bartender & servers chat incessantly with, what appeared to be the manager - but this "employee", of some sort, was initially drinking beer at the bar, but would get up and go behind the bar to help himself to items.  WTH?  Either you are working or you are not.  Pick which one and stick to it.  He made no secret that he was associated with the establishment, as he engaged another table in discussion as to the up-coming specials and  hours and menu changes.  In closing, I have to say this is in a great location, and I was really looking forward to visiting - I had such high hopes!  The hype they put out there on emails, twitter, texts, ect. made them sound fabby. It's unfortunate that such little details all gathered up to me as a complete strike-out & not a fun night out.    Thank goodness for dependable ROKA AKOR, which we promptly parked ourselves at, and as usual we were treated with the upmost high standards, excellent drinks, fantastic service, and amazing food.  They have happy hour all night there, if you don't already know!  Rawk on!

went for breakfast - and i am SO NOT a breakfast person - but the protien pancakes i had were the BESTest pancakes (and i pretty much ahte pancakes) i have ever had!  wow - Y U M !! granola and oatmeal and everything good for you.  guys totally luved the taco /salsa /potaoe / bacon / egg breakfast pates - they were very yummy - all cooked and presented just right.  i do have to say that drinks took about 45 mins or so to arrive at the table, but what everrrrrrr....  our waiter was very nice and polite - wasn't his fault that the milk was sour in the choclate milk or the bloody mary had to be harvested from the vine 1st -  or the champange splt had to be shipped in from Cali ....  he was still cool :-)  i would def. like to try again and ck out happy hour and wine list - why not?

As Donkey would say: Wo O O W.  Have you SEEN the views from here?!  Nestled beside Pinnacle Peak Mountain, with views that last forever into the valley - and hey!  ck out that sunset - do you see the moon?  Look at those STARS!  Ken was the most efficient, knowlegable and attentive server - good grief, I was almost (but not quite) getting uncomfortable by his outstanding attention and prompt service - I mean did i look like a celebrity ???  YUMmmEE caramlized pear flatbread pizza!  And funky handmade potatoe chips with sweet & spicy dip.  Huh, interesting!  We later moved inside, onward and into the catacombs of a private wine room in Talavera, the adjoining dinning area ... but THAT is another story... review.... experience.....   Of course - i'll be back!  r u kidding ?!?!

slightly unfair writing a review, since only 15% of this place is currently open!  No Pools (ok, roughed-in cement) rooms - not availble - yet - July ?? you only get thick-smoke-filled casio floor - COUGH-COUGH-HAACK !  but, hey!  who needs vegas now?  seriously, Orange Sky @ 15th floor was super nice, GR8 service, perfect tini with Van Gough, yummy Nom~Noms.  i am looking forward to seeing the rooms, pools, ect. since they are using all cutting edge technology from top to bottom on this place.  to be continued...

I so cannot believe I am going to write about $1 store... but I just HAD to. This place is brand new. Sparkling new. Party Favors Galore! Everything was neat & tidy. Pool Noodles $1 - usually $5. Nice Bath, Spa & Shower Goodies. Alll shelves stocked up the Ying Yang. Fabby end-of-year Teacher & Grad gifts. Great Storage Bins of all shapes & sizes.  So, as you can see, a dollar store impressed me.  I'm going back tomorrow for a shipment of solar patio lights there getting in.  Yes. Solar Lights.  For $1.  Cool?  or what?

I should have known better, especially after I realized this aquarium was located "inside" AZ Mall.  I really felt sorry for the huge line of people standing outside, in the heat, for over an hour,and most with babies and toddlers.  (I was lucky to have obtained passes and was ushered inside immediately).    First of all, don't even think about going for a few months until the crowds die down!!  It was horrible: having to wait to see each and every pool, pond, tank, and exhibit all the while surrounded by the crush of people, tiny kids running around your legs, 10 yr olds shoving past you, and tripping over dozens of strollers everywhere.  Even with all that mayhem, it still only took 1 hour to go through the entire place!!  It definitely would have made a big difference to have been about 60% less people, but 'd have to say in no way, shape or form is this worth $100 for a family of 4!!.  Even with my  1/2  price discount I can't say that even $50 did I get the feel it was worth it at all.  Maybe around $10 per adult would have made it palatable and only then would I recommend it.    The kids are given little scratch off cards to take quizzes and trivia questions throughout.  They are 'suppose' to get a prize at the end.  Guess what? They had none left, even though we were done before noon!  (Should have at least offered something!)  Seriously, I would not go back, I don't think even if I obtained free passes.  What a big disappointment!  I thought that since they were somehow affiliated with LegoLand I would have expected MUCH more.

15th floor = views of all Scottsdale, fountain hills - and then some!   Cutting edge.  Super sleek & elite.   Sexy glass balconies for extra view-points.   Whooshed up in private elevators that provide a glimpse of things to come in glass-enclosed ride, but only briefly since it's only seconds to reach the top.  I can't wait until they start with specials such as wine tastings, beginning July.

VIP invite?  check. Arrive early?  yes - but so did the rest of Scottsdale!  WOW.  What. A. Party!  WHOOP~WHOOP!  So, this will be a bit biased, since the entire night was Gratis - so how can this be anything other than 10 stars - wait, there's only 5 here, damn...  I think 97% of the people here thought the roving wait staff who branished house wine was their only option, thankfully, because I seem to have a good feeling about these situations, I went right in for the Top Shelf Grey Goose La Poire  (that's Anjour pear Infused, btw).  All I can say is good thing I was dropped off and did not have a car! {enough said about that!}  (Oh, can't wait to go back to see live band Fri/Sat evenings)  (and to experience their happy hour)  (oh, and to go when the crowd is under 2000+  )

Dresses and Blouses and Shoes - O MY!  Went to the VIP Opening Last nite - what fun: H&M knows how to throw and Opening Party!  (Officially opens July 22).  The kids dept.  was so much fun - makes me want to take my daughter to Paris Now!  Cute hats, jewelry, tights, dresses, and eveything sparkly!  Accessories galore.  (wish the shoes had higher heels). The prices were amazing for all the detail & style put into all the clothing.    OK, might go back tomorrow :-)

Talk about totally Fabby location!  Absolutly beautiful patio and gorgeous views all around.  Scottsdale Quarter is on it's way to being a Fabby Shopping distict which delights all the senses.    House Smoked Salmon & Pita Crackers was delicious  Edamame Dumplings were very interesting  The Hangover RX Elixer was FANTASTIC! {& just what I needed for a Saturday morning!}  Bison Burger not my choice, but hubby enjoyed the change  I was in love with my Panang Chicken Curry Bowl!  Y U Mmmmers !  The Hybrid Martini, with Belvedere & Hibiscus was too sweet for  my taste - hole the Hibiscus and more basil lemon next time :-)  The bottle of NZ Sav Blanc was a perfect pair with the curry!  Pomegranate Sorbet was refreshing  Chocolate Flourless Cake was good to share {x 3} - caramel sauce was too sweet, but again, really enjoyed the 3 spoonful's.  It was a beautiful brunch time on a  perfect Fall day in AZ !   Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm .....

A salon, a cafe, a 'spa', fashion boutique, and makeup bar, all in 1 unique new retail concept.   Very cool, cutting edge fashion designs. Luv the Starbuck's cafe inside a clothing store. (How many times have you been sitting, getting your hair done, and so wishing for a latte? - now, if we can just get them to serve wine as well...... that would totally rawk !)   I will definitely go back to have a gel mani & pedi - all the array of glitter is beckoning to me!   I am so loving the whole Scottsdale Quarter, the fantastic feel of the great architecture, the resort-like feel with the fountains & towering palms, and lighting effects at nite. Seems to be a new store or restaurant every week, with more on the way!

All the staff, from the front host, to the bartender on break, and to the waiter who came over to talk to us but we weren't even his customers - everything was fabby.  Thank you Thomas, at the bar, who gave impeccable service with a smile (I think he chews Orbit Gum).  Bacon Popcorn was terribly good, and the mini fondue was to DIE for!    and, BTW, thanks to ALL who treated my daughter so outstandingly and made her laugh the whole time!

Visited about a dozen times.  "If" you like rude and arrogant staff and paying for procedures that don't work or need to be re-done, then this is the place for you!!    Oh, and BTW, "if" you would further like to be dismissed as a client by the spa because you do not like being treated this way, you must go and experience this amazing treatment for yourself - it's so unique and makes you feel very special.    I will chose 1 of the 40 other awesome Med Spas that are w/n 10 miles of me :-)

ALL the staff has always warmly invited me into the store and each visit I have been treated with smiles, great service, helpful tips and just generally happy employees who really like working there - and it shows.  (unlike the "other" beauty store acorss the street).

If you have 15 minutes open in your schedule, go ahead.  Maze took only a few minutes - seriously disappointing.  The Laser Maze thing was 1 minute for $5 -- really??  (BTW I totally love all the 5 star rvws, this Maze being their ONLY raving rvw).
