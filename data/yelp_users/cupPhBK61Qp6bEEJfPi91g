Student and Early Bird (before 6pm) specials on weekdays (not including Friday) - steak (or pork or fish) and all you can eat salad bar for ~12$. Awesome!  This is the place to go for your steak fix on a student budget.

Hands down the best milkshakes in Chambana. I love that they still have phosphates, and that they will mix milkshake flavors to your liking. This restaurant has been a go-to for me for the last four years in this town. All their burgers are a sure fire thing. Make sure you get em with a side of sweet potato chips. The service here has always been superb, and if you make it early enough for the breakfast menu, lucky you it's phenomenal.

Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town.

This is the place to go if you're looking for a depressing atmosphere and an excuse to miss class because you're too busy nursing your GI tract. It's a cafeteria style 'restaurant' (I use that term loosely), with cleaning carts visible stacked in the dining area. The food in my opinion is overpriced, overcooked, and well dangerous to eat (I got sick after my first and only trip to this place). Not to mention the small portion size for the price you pay - I mean at most Thai places, you can get another meal out of your leftovers, but not here...I also want to mention how empty this place always is when I walk by (on my way to the Subways, or BBQ joint next door) - never a good sign.

I came here for a graduation dinner on the recommendation of a friend (who works here as a waitress so I took the rec with a grain of salt). I was pleasantly surprised. We got a window table with a great view of the water. The server was super friendly and on her rec I ordered the duck - which was delicious. It was cooked perfectly with the right trimmings. I wish I had discovered this place earlier, like before I moved out of Chambana...I recommend this place for a reasonable meal with a great atmosphere!

This place is easily my FAVORITE bbq joint in Chambana. I was beyond pleased with the food when it first opened (before the liquor license even), and even more thrilled now that there is a full bar and decent beer selection. The last time I went, the restaurant was offering beer flights. It was my bad luck that the flight they had that week was all dark beers (not my fave) but they do change the offerings in the flight. I always get the burnt ends (when they're not sold out) and sweet potato fries, but the Cuban sandwich special is also delicious. PS - try the different bbq sauces!

This is not a real Starbucks. They do not honor rewards from the Starbucks card/rewards program. There is also no wifi here, free or otherwise. The staff here is pretty incompetent, they're slow an unhappy to be here. On a busy Saturday morning with a line to the door, of the three people working, only one was making drinks while one person was working the cash register (and making a ton of mistakes from what I gathered and overheard during my more than 20 minute wait for a grande coffee). The third person working basically walked back and forth from the register to the drinks line looking confused and not really helping...avoid this 'Starbucks' location at all costs...

Solid legit Starbucks in CityScape. Convenient location to many hotels and shops, and roomy interior with lots of seating and table of different sizes. The wifi is powered by Google, free and decently fast. The baristas are friendly and quick with orders and a smile.

Adorable!   Some friends and I were staying at the hotel next door when we were in town for the weekend for a wedding. We found this place on Yelp (great reviews and donuts? YES!) and decided to check it out for breakfast.   The Fractured Prune is located within a larger store that houses several businesses (a bar, a small grocery store selling mostly local goods, and a coffee shop) so it is a bit of a one-stop shop for breakfast. This does mean that although you see the sign for the Fractured Prune outside, you may end up walking around the corner to the actual entrance - it was a bit confusing the navigate (mostly because I was hungry). Do also note the hours they are open, as it is mostly a breakfast place they do close early most days.  The Fractured Prune has a HUGE selection of tiny flavored donuts (perfectly sized so you can try a variety). In addition to the extensive menu of flavors, they also have daily specials and other flavors that are not listed. Once you place your order and pay at the cashier, the donuts are glazed and flavored fresh, so there is a short wait (but totally worth it as they come out hot and gooey). Each donut is only $2, and they are even less during 'donut happy hours' and if you buy more. (So obviously we bought more). I enjoyed these donuts so much I came back the next day for more.  Go get you some donuts, you won't regret it.
