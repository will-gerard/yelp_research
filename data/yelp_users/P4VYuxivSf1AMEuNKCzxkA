Excellent and speedy job replacing a diamond in my wedding ring. They also did a protectant coat on the gold and boy does it shine. Even better, the price was great!

Awesome and fast service. It's sometimes hard for a chick to feel comfortable when it comes to getting her car serviced in fear of getting (for lack of a better term) screwed over or treated inferior. But this team of fellas were respectful from start to finish and talked to me about my car as if I actually knew a thing or two about it (which I fortunately do!). Justin took care of me today and reminded me why I always come here. Thanks!!

I am still so angry over my recent experience here last week, and I feel this is the only way people will truly know what an awful pharmacy this is. Now to be fair, I have loved this pharmacy for years. The techs all knew my family and our meds and we never had a problem. However in the last month, they got a new pharmacist "Ron" and subsequently lost a lot of their techs. My son has autism and is on quite a few meds that cannot be missed due to dangerous side effects so we always try to keep everything filled before they run out and this pharmacy always  did an excellent job. All of a sudden this last week, meds weren't filled at all. The wait times were ridiculous, for example I waited 45 min in drivethru for them to not have them ready. I was told "tomorrow" four times last week. Finally my poor son was completely out of his meds and missed over a days worth. When I came home Friday evening after a long day working in cardiac surgery my boy was pacing back and forth and so upset. He had a horrible day at school and was dizzy. It was a little before 8 (they close at 10) so I went to the pharmacy to see if they finally had his scripts filled and I also had scripts that his doc had given us that day.   When I got to the pharmacy there were a couple people waiting, and I'm not sure how many were waiting in line outside. I could see the pharmacist and techs were busy and he was yelling at his staff. I dropped the scripts off and said I would wait. The tech whispered to the pharmacist Ron and told him we were completely out of meds. He was very rude and said "absolutely not, we are too far behind to fill these tonight". She apologized to me and said they couldn't fill them. They had two hours left before closing! I explained to him that we had waited all week for the one script and he was completely out of meds. He said he couldn't do "anymore favors". Really?! Favors!? He told me it was my fault for not getting there earlier that day. Well excuse me for having to take care of patients late. This is what we do in healthcare! I explained that (and he should know this) it is dangerous to miss psych meds and my son was already symptomatic. He told me it wasn't his problem and that he was going to have to stay late if he filled my scripts--and here I got off late taking care of a critically ill patient.  Amongst other horrifying things, he said he didn't care if he lost our family as customers. The tech even pleaded with him to make an exception and fill it and he snapped at her as well. I repeat, they had two hours and I would have been more than willing to wait until they closed. I was in tears at that point and I admit I did finally raise my voice and told him we were done with this pharmacy and would be going elsewhere. He told me nobody in town would be able to help me that night...again, two hours until closing!   Fortunately, there was a happy ending. The CVS down the road on sossaman took pity on a tearful, exhausted nurse and filled my scripts within 30 min. They apologized for my treatment at the other store and told me that store had recently lost a lot of employees because of this new pharmacist and had been sending other fed up customers to them. As a healthcare employee, we are supposed to be dedicated to our community and those in need of care. What a sorry excuse for a "healthcare professional"!

Great food and real people. Being from the Midwest, I've been homesick for a restaurant that had a true blue fish fry and down to earth service. From the taxidermy on the walls to the amazing fried cod and waitress who called me "hun", I felt truly at home. Thanks! We will be back!

It would be so nice if this place was closer to home--though not for my waistline since I could literally drink that jalapeño ranch they serve with their delicious sweet potato waffle fries. Yes, it's good this place is a drive for me.   Love the Midwest tavern vibe of this place. Cameron was our server tonight and he was fantastic. It's always nice when your server loves the food he serves. His recommendations were great. The jalapeño popper potato skins were very good, but they would be amazing with bacon (hell, what isn't?!). They are served with a concoction called cactus sauce--sweet, tangy, yup this could go on anything. Can't wait to try it on their wings. My husband loved that he could get a fried egg on his burger and I really enjoyed my buffalo chicken tacos. Wish they had a cocktail menu, but this is really a cold beer place anyway. We will be back!

Ahhhh! I've loved this place for years and it was such a treat to get to this side of town and have some wonderful fajitas. I'm a big fan of restaurants that concentrate on one thing and do it well, and this place does not waver from that. All the food is made in the middle of the restaurant so you can watch with your mouth watering as they freshly grill the tender meats and spicy onions for your meal. I always get the "Cadillac Fajitas" which is beef tenderloin--a little more expensive than the regular steak but worth every penny. And the tortillas (oh the tortillas!!!!!!) are so doughy, buttery, and just plain delicious! The service is always on point, and margaritas are strong...you just can't go wrong with this place!

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! I am still absolutely horrified by the customer service we received today. Our spa broke the other night (of course when we were actually going to use it), so we called our home warrenty who apparently are contracted with Foster's. I read some negative and positive reviews on Kudzu, but of course, we are at the mercy of our home warrenty.  The technician came to our house today to do a diagnostic on it, and after a while with him outside, we received a call from our home warranty telling us that the technician called them and said he was unfamiliar with our type of spa and would not be able to fix it. First of all, the spa and control panel are by two different companies so we have no clue what which company  he was unfamiliar with. Second, and most shocking, we went outside to talk to him and HE WAS GONE! He just left without even speaking to us. In all fairness, we called the company to complain and they offered to send someone else out. Thankfully our warranty is sending a different company to us.

Sweet Child O' Mine this was gooood!!! --sorry, that song has been stuck in my head since driving over to check out this restaurant. I've kind of gotten out of the habit of checking groupon after a few not so good experiences, but this deal was too great to pass up. 14 bucks for two dinner buffets? Sure!! My husband and I have been on a quest to find an Indian buffet with some actual heat--we found it!!!!  At first glance, total hole in the wall in a weird part of Tempe. But that was totally part of its charm. We walked in, were seated promptly and ordered our usual Haywards beer and mango lassi. Pretty solid lassi, though I have had better. But the gem of this place was the buffet. Not huge, not glamorous but the flavors made up for it's appearance. Three flavors of Byrani rice, all aromatic and a nice addition to the saucy dishes. Though I do wish they offered other proteins besides chicken, the Marsala, tandoori, korma and curry were all perfectly spiced and delicious. They don't Americanize the spice which was refreshing--yes I love having to wipe my nose during my meal! The vegetarian options were great too, but the star was the samosas. I usually am not fond of them since they are usually quite brand, but even the damn pastry was spicy! The flaky crust melted in my mouth and the potato and veggie filling was smooth and buttery. I was also very impressed with their dessert collection, but blown away by their dessert counter of freshly made Indian candies and sweets you could order to take home. I have no clue what the hell anything was, but this milk and nut bar thing they had was divine! It was sticky and sweet and I totally bought enough to last a week to with my coffee.   The owner introduced himself to us on our way out. They've been open since 1988, and I found it sad that he was trying to get us to come back by explaining they were family owned and make everything fresh. The food spoke for itself. Next time I will order off the menu and try more. But I'm sure he was concerned that it was pretty empty. So I'm doing my part to spread the word--this place is a diamond in the rough!

Decided to veer from our typical breakfast burrito spot and try something new this morning. I must say, this was one tasty breakfast burrito! My hubby and I both had a bacon, potato and egg burrito which came with beans on it as well. I wasn't too sure about the refried beans, but it added a nice texture and another level of flavor along with the perfectly spiced hot sauce. The potatoes were basically French fries, which in my opinion made it especially sinful...god I wish they were open late night for that vodka fueled burrito fix! All and all, we both inhaled our breakfast and vowed to return for more next weekend :)

Uncle Bears is back! We were here a few years ago and were sad that the food and service was lacking. We stayed away until tonight when our old standby was too full to accommodate. We were so impressed by everything! From the minute we came in the service was upbeat and welcoming. Our server Katrina was so knowledgable and eager to tell us about their new beers and menu item. The beer was excellent! We loves good craft brew and this reminded us of when four peaks was still small and local. I had the chicken sliders which were better than ever with the added avocado. My hubby had the green chili burger and enjoyed it.  The only thing they could've made better was adding more to their appetizer menu. All the norms are there but they could use some additional items. Glad to be back!

Wow! This was unexpectedly fantastic! After reading the reviews we went in with mixed expectations, but we were actually blown away by the delicious food and warm service. Our waiter Chao was enthusiastic about the menu and engaged us in pleasant conversation throughout our meal. The food was just like the great Chinese food my husband and I had back east--me from Michigan, my hubby from Boston. To start the egg rolls were crisp and fresh and omg that mustard was HOT! Chap explained they add wasabi to it for that extra bite. The hot and sour soup was hands down the best we've had. Unlike most, it was full of flavor with shrimp, green onions, shiitakes and that wonderful tang. I'm glad I had some left over! For entrees we ordered General Tsos chicken, sweet and sour pork, and Kung Pao beef. All were delicious, but that General Tsos was unlike any other I've had. Instead of deep fried nuggets of chicken, it was large slices of chicken with a delicate batter. The sauce was homemade and a great balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy. We are so happy to have this in the neighborhood and will be back soon.

Guess I will add my review to the other 1-star accounts of this horrid place. However, I'm sure nothing will change because this place has been getting consistent complaints for years with no change or acknowledgment by management. They are always out of food at peak hours leaving many customers standing waiting for fresh food.  Of course, they always try to offer remnants of the afternoons dishes that are all crusted over and dry. Staff is far from interested in customer service and is usually seen standing around. The other Panda Express locations don't seem to have this problem. Such a shame.

Wow something abruptly changed! Since this place opened, I haven't had a bad meal. Always fresh and tasty. But I think they hired a new cook who doesn't know what the hell he's doing. First taste of the macaroni salad and something tasted off. Couldn't figure out what I was tasting, but almost chemical in nature. I switched it up and started on the chicken. I covered it as usual with teriyaki sauce. It was completely and utterly rancid tasting! I tried the meat alone and it was fine, but the sauce was horrid. It even stunk when I held it up to my nose. My husband tasted it and instantly said "woah that's bad". I took the sauce up to the girls at the register. They tasted and smelled the sauce and agreed. The one girl said "I don't know how to fix this!" And the other girl yelled at the cook "dude you gotta make this again! This is bad!!". I'm going to call corporate and complain in hopes they will fix the problem. I want my place back!!

This is the most amazing gelato we have ever had! The customer service was warm and welcoming and the flavors are out of this world! Enjoy some delicious gelato and then wander over to the Italian grocery store for some imported meats, cheese, and pasta.

Writing this review makes me angry because I have always loved this store. Being from the Midwest, I enjoy looking at everything this huge store has to offer. The staff is always sweet and helpful--unless you are a woman shopping for a gun. I was prepared to drop over 600 dollars on a particular gun that I had been looking to buy for a while. I tried to get the attention of many of the salesmen but I watched them repeatedly skip over me to address the needs of other clientele, who of course were all men. And it wasn't that they just didn't see me. Here I was with cash in hand, knew what I wanted, and nobody would help me. The ironic part is, not one of the other customers actually bought anything. I took my business to AJI instead where they were more than happy to sell a little lady the revolver she's always wanted.

Yum!!!! We really really enjoyed our dinner tonight. The spices were perfect and the cool mango lassi turned down the heat (we had a level 10 tonight to clear the sinuses!). Everything from the paneer naan to the lamb vindaloo was delicious. And the service was top notch with everyone being welcoming and knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back and try more! Thanks!

THANK YOU!!!   I have drafted this review reportedly and have stopped short from submitting it because I feel my words could never truly express the gratitude I feel for this wonderful farm.   On August 20th, the love of my life proposed to me. Part of my proposal consisted of little surprises of random things I've always wanted to do. It sounds a bit odd but I have always loved miniature donkeys, though I had never seen one up close. Knowing this, my fiancé looked all over for someone who owned one. Lo and behold, this farm (which happens to be behind our house) had what he was looking for--a mini donkey named Picante. Long story short, I was taken here and surprised with my own private petting zoo!   Here's where I get emotional. The farmer, Jason, went above and beyond for us and I am still so touched by his generosity. When my fiancé explained to him his plan to propose, Jason said he would do anything for love and opened his farm to us on his day off. He let us stay as long as we wished and we had a great experience. The farm was awesome and I cannot wait to go on a Thursday night for the market. As I stated before, words cannot possibly express how much we appreciate Jason. He even continued correspondence with my fiancé to congratulate us and give us his blessing.  We are getting married soon and this perfect stranger played a role in us starting our life together. Thank you so much. We will always remember your kindness (and our new friend Picante).

Though some picky foodies turn their noses up on the americanized, overly cheesy, ginormous portions at this cafe...this is why this place is great! From the strong and flavorful margaritas to the burrito smothered with jalapeño cream cheese (I could bathe in this stuff), we have not had a bad meal here. Service has always been on point and the atmosphere is always laid back and inviting. So sniff at the chips all you want, I will gladly take your portion! :)

I see this place gets a bad rap on their reviews and my first visit here last year wasn't the best. However, all the rest of my experiences have always been positive and this is now my go-to place. Sounds sexist, but as a woman, it is easy to get treated like you're stupid and get taken advantage of when it comes to car maintenance . These guys are always professional and I never feel swindled or offended. They are nice and very helpful in their suggestions. The car wash always does a good job washing the exterior and vacuuming up after my messy toddler. I also enjoy getting a cup of coffee and sitting on a comfy couch watching the news while I wait. Dont be afraid of the bad reviews, just check it out. I won't go anywhere else.

Always a favorite. Everything from the Chicago dogs to the Italian beef is just damn delicious! The cheese fries are covered in a wiz-like sauce, and to me just decadent. For us midwest transplants, it's nice to feel a little like being back home. Oh and don't forget the Green River soda!!

Ok, there are what it seems one reflexology place per every 5 miles in Mesa, but this is our go to spot. Is it better than Thai Foot massage on Dobson? Eh...it's not as neat and pretty. But, they give one hell of a massage and I do love that my husband and I get our own room as opposed to being out in the open for all to see you sprawled out on a massage chair. I'm sure I don't look attractive with my mouth wide open snoring while someone massages my feet! Every tech I've had at Happy Feet is quite skilled and really takes their time to make sure you get a full quality massage. Sure, sometimes it feels weird (especially when they do the ear thing) but afterwards we both end up feeling like jello with all cares forgotten.

I am so appreciative of the beautiful experience we were given at Talavera last night. It was our second trip there and both visits were above and beyond what we could ever expect. You can look at the pictures and other reviews of the dishes (all absolutely delicious), but I would like to focus on the hospitality and overall experience.   From start to finish, we were treated as if we were a big deal. I felt like the president himself would get the same treatment we received. The staff was so knowledgeable and worked endlessly to make our night memorable. From the impressive wine suggestions and food pairings, to the unique mid course and after dinner treats, we felt spoiled. The clientele is upscale, and I realize that most of them can afford to come here on a regular basis. I'm actually grateful that I cannot because all the "little extras" were not little to us. We noticed and appreciated everything so much. Every visit here has been an experience of a lifetime. Thank you.

Once again, an outstanding and memorable dining experience at Talavera. From the smart wine pairings to the melt in your mouth seabass, my company and I were in complete bliss. Hospitality is their specialty at the Four Seasons and we were treated like VIPs from the minute we walked in the door. We started off with some very unique cocktails in the lounge, the new habanero mescal concoction is definitely not to be missed. I'm a sucker for a dirty martini. The ice cold Titos vodka with the briny blue cheese olives set my whole mood for the night --yah yah yah I was tipsy, don't judge me! We dined on the patio, which in my opinion is the best patio in Arizona. The scenery is beautiful with the mountains and sunset. Nightingales flew around the desert landscape after the sun went down. Precious!   The food as usual was beyond perfect. My party tried a bit of everything, but the favorite dishes were the ahi tuna appetizer, the lobster bisque, and of course the heavenly seabass. I dream about this meal during the year, so as much as I would like to stray and try something new for my entree, I have to have the seabass. The buttery potato gnocchi paired with the velvety fish is taken to a whole different level with the crispy, savory shreds of oxtail. Never in my life have I had such a perfect dish--and I've tried everything!  We ended the evening with pretty much every dessert on the menu. The hands down favorite here was the vanilla scented marscapone with the hibiscus berries--I WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS. We had a tasting of fine Madeira wine which really sealed the deal. Some strong coffee to sober up and then we sadly ended our evening.   Thank you to the amazing team at Talavera. Our server Juan (pronounced like Wyclef Jean) was knowledgeable, funny, and more than accommodating. We were beyond spoiled for our family reunion. On a personal note, my uncle who joined us just beat cancer this last year and was able to travel from Minneapolis to see us for the first time in two years. You made the visit more than special, it was magical.

Wow this place has really improved over the years---and is way better than the place across the street! The Sicilian pizza we ordered was so so good! The crust was thick and chewy, the onions were actually caramelized, and the cheese was gooey and definitely not the cheap stuff. We were really impressed and will order again. Thanks!

I mean it's IHOP so standard diner fare so why bother reviewing, but I was sick an hour after eating here. Getting the trots on my only day off this week means a 1 star review. But judging by the other nasty reviews, they don't care anyway.

Oh yelp you steered me wrong! Before I begin it should be known that I AM a yooper from the upper peninsula in Michigan and grew up with nothing but small "ma and pa" diners. Stick to your rib, no frills, just good hearty food was the norm for me, so I was excited to try this place. Moreover a restaurant owned by people from my neck of the woods was so appealing to me, and being a bit homesick, I dragged my hubby there this morning. What a disappointment.   They were a little busy as to be expected on a Sunday, and we ignored the fact that a gentleman who came after us was seated first, but I think it struck a subconscious cord with us. Again, to be fair, there was a huddle of people by the register, how were they to know?  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but we had about four different waitresses throughout, none particularly pleasant because they were so quick and rushed. And I was disappointed that my attempt for small talk with our main waitress was rebutted. Damn, wanted to talk about Michigan but she had no clue where the owners were from (though there were "yooper" flags all over.  Now the food. Corned beef hash was from a can (we were warned by our waitress) and my biscuits and gravy were dry with meatless gravy. Wonderbread toast, undercooked scrambled eggs and just weak coffee just made this breakfast heartbreaking.   I really really hate to post this review. I am nowhere near a food snob or picky for that matter, but this was sad. Even the canned hash would be forgiven if there was flavor added (hell I grew up on the stuff). But we were left with upset tummies and even worse, wasted time. At least it was less that 30 bucks, but I would've paid double for a good meal and nice time.

My husband and I have been wanting to come here for years, so before a concert we finally decided to give it a try. To sum it up, it definitely lives up it's namesake of Arrogant. We were stuffed next to another couple in basically a doorway-so close you would think we were all together. That turned out to be ok as we chatted it up with them while waiting for service. I watched a waited scurry around and roll his eyes multiple times, and of course he turned out to be our waiter. He seemed very uninterested and didn't seem enthusiastic about...well anything really. The couple next to us said he was quite rude to them as well. We ordered a couple old fashions, which were delicious, but because the vibe was so unfriendly we decided to just get a charcuterie board and leave. The board took quite a while, but it was tasty. We got our check and went across the street for our dinner. We usually do eat at pricey places for date night, but the pretentious service just made it not worth it.

We've come to the Harp from time to time over the last few years. They do have impressive fish and chips (and coming from the land-o-fishfry that's sayin something). BUT...the service is always spotty and the rest of the food is just meh. We had a nice size group tonight for a reserved going away party. The restaurant was pretty empty except for us so one would think we would have attentive staff. Nah. This waiter was so uninterested he hardly interacted with any of us, nevermind a smile or eye contact. I'm also just gonna be blunt and say the food was just bad tonight. The Guinness fondue seemed like it was canned nacho cheese with no beer flavor. The pretzels served with it were under baked and tasted old, not to mention a small portion for 10 bucks. The potato boats were average, but again small for that much money. My Reuben sandwich was just ok and underwhelming...at least toast the bread!  If it wasn't my pal's going away party we wouldn't have stayed as long as we did and I can pretty much guarantee we won't be back.

Here we go again. I just want to tell this manager "Bro! You've got it all and you're blowing it!!!!!". You have this beautiful restaurant, prime location, some killer fish and chips, but you're half empty. Why? Because you could give a rats ass about your customers! Once again we were seated and forgotten about. We sat there in plain sight and were never acknowledged for over 15 (19 to be exact) minutes. Meanwhile, we watched other people who came after us get their drinks and orders in. I waved at two servers and even the manager who suddenly were overcome with blindness. The table next to us said that it took over 20 minutes to get someone to acknowledge them too when they arrived. Unacceptable!! They were nice (or crazy) enough to stick it out for the good fish and chips. I refuse to spend my money on such poor service, and honestly, fish or no fish, I cannot fathom why you are still in business. I came back after your last apology for the same shoddy service and got treated exactly the same. But this time I was not giving you part of my hard earned paycheck. I had to seek you out before we left to tell you we were leaving and why. In all fairness, you apologized, but really did not seem to care (maybe even relieved). Such a shame.

We used a Groupon for this place last night and hate to say we were a bit disappointed. The place was completely empty at 7pm in Old Town (big red flag considering even the  Olive Garden averages an hour wait every night of the week this time of year). But we kept an open mind thinking this could be a "hidden gem"  Our waitress/host/bartender was very nice and a little apologetic on the groupon restrictions---lots of restrictions--but we ordered our two appetizers, four beers, two entrees, and desserts from the list.  Beer selection was good, and I was so pleased to have the last pumpkin porter in Arizona (another red flag that they still had some post season). We ordered calamari and arancini as appetizers. Was disappointed that their was an "off" flavor to the rice balls and the calamari were rubbery rings of grease. The grease didn't stop with my carbonara. What a shame that the delicate handmade pasta would be swimming in oil and soggy bacon. My tummy has not recovered yet from that. In all fairness, my hubby ordered the blue bison burger and he said it was not bad, though  he left a quarter of it on his plate (unheard of!). Dessert was another story. The groupon only let us have a choice of pie or cake so we couldn't get the s'more dessert or the banana crepes...was looking forward to those. We ordered the cake and it was dry and cold.   All and all, would have to say the night out was appreciated but our overall experience was "MEH!". Such a shame that such a cool restaurant does not stand a chance, even in such a great location. Would love to be wrong on this one.

I don't even want people to know how amazing this place is because I want it all to myself! Had an absolutely heavenly experience here with my hubby for his valentines day present. I stumbled upon this place on groupon and called them to see what they had for couples.   The receptionist was sweet and knowledgeable and recommended a package called "lomi for lovers". I have to admit I giggled like a school girl as she described the "ritual" as it included picking a candle to burn, robes, and one partner oiling up the other pre-massage. But I thought, "what the hell, lets cheese it up for him"!  I had no idea the bliss that was in store for us.  We arrived a bit early but the staff was friendly and had us pick out our candle that would burn during our massage (we picked a nice pineapple scent). We were them whisked away, changed into robes and slippers, and relaxed in their pretty lounge overlooking a quaint little lake. Our masseuses (Zach and Jodi) soon greeted us and explained the process, as a "lomi lomi" is not your typical massage.  Our massage was 90 minutes of heaven. We were out on a large table together which we both thought was so sweet. Now fair warning, unlike typical massages, we were draped with very small towels--like omg they can see everything that jiggles!--but the essentials are covered. And once they douse you with lightly scented toasty coconut oil and massage you with long therapeutic strokes, you could care less about what they see! Part way through the massage, they turned us towards each other and massaged our backs. Was so romantic as we both were just nose to nose smiling at each other in our drunk-like stupor. After the massage we added a 30 minute steam in their unique (and private) steam/shower room. This helped the oils soak in and the shower was absolutely amazing with its million jets. Simply wonderful!  Cannot thank the staff enough, especially Zach and Jodi,for giving us a midweek vacation from life. We felt so pampered and it truly brought us closer together. We joined the couples club and will definitely look forward to going again.

I can't believe we are just trying this place. Where do I begin? Happy hour, happy hour, HAPPY HOUR!! My hubby and I had heard that appetizers were half off between 3-7 so we decided it would be a good time to try it out.   First of all, the house margarita ($4.50 on happy hour) was fantastic---not too sweet with a nice kick. They also had a ginger peach margarita on special that was very good too.  For appetizers we enjoyed the crab cakes, calamari, and the fresh guacamole. The crab cakes were out of this world. The sweet corn sauce was the perfect compliment to the crab. I would definitely order this again. We consider ourselves calamari snobs as its one of our favorite apps, and TQLA's gives other restaurants a run for their money. The batter was crisp and light and to our surprise they added fried jalapeños and onions to the basket. It was a huge portion and the spicy sauce and garlicky aioli was a nice touch. Chips and salsa paired with the guacamole was enough to push us over the food coma edge. They serve two salsas, green and roasted tomato. We ordered an additional habanero salsa as well...EPIC! We asked our waitress what the base was because it was deliciously sweet with a nice heat. To our surprise the base is carrot with pineapple, apple and of course the habanero. I could've made a meal on the salsa and tasty guacamole alone.  All in all, I think we found a new place. The restaurant was beautiful, the service was friendly, and the food was excellent. We will be back again soon :)

Other than my beloved Grams' famous cherry pie, this was one of the best I've had. The tart Michigan cherries made us homesick for the Upper Peninsula and the crust was rich and flaky. Delicious! Can't wait to try the rest!

I was compelled to write a review of this attraction after reading some of the poor reviews recently. Lighten up people! You are expecting way too much! My bf and I went this past December and were looking forward to a fun night with some scares. In my opinion we got way more than that. Yes it lives up to classic Vegas pricing, but I think that's fair because everything is pricey in that city. We both had a blast! The actors were horrifying and the scenery was out of my worst nightmares. The acting was genius and I was drenched with sweat from the adrenaline rush. The bar had an awesome view as well. God bless you Eli Roth! You gave us a scare and a fun night. Please stay open so we can get married here!!

After being reassured that their bankruptcy wouldn't effect them being open on our wedding day, and after taking $1300, we got word today that as of Oct 2nd the Goretorium will be CLOSED PERMANENTLY! We paid for our wedding which is only 4 weeks away and now we may not get our money back. There aren't words to describe how disappointed we are. We've been planning this for a year and now we have a few short weeks to find another place.

First off, I cannot even express our gratitude for such a wonderful experience celebrating our grandfather's 84th birthday tonight. He really enjoyed the restaurant and dining (and drinking) under the stars in such a beautiful setting. Everything at this restaurant is well thought out and unique. From the smokey (potent!) Clint Eastwood cocktail to the sweet and savory Chicken and Waffles with a kick, we were blown away. More so, the service was the best the valley has to offer. Tony took excellent care of us, to  the point where we felt like he was celebrating with us. I wish he could've joined us! Thank you so very much for treating us like we were part of the Proof family. We will definitely be back.

Wow this was a delicious surprise! My hubby and I started our date night driving around looking for a place without an hour+ wait and found ourselves at Bobbos. We had been curious about it and although it was busy, the friendly hostess had us seated within 15 min!   I'm a sucker for a good classic cocktail and was so happy to see such an assortment of interesting drinks. I had the Moscow Mule and was excited that they served it in a traditional copper mug. Excellent!!  Now on to the food...yum, yum, and more yum! I could have made a meal on the bread alone--warm, melt in your mouth, and served with a balsamic, olive oil concoction that was perfect. We ordered Caesar salads, which were lovely, though the plate itself could've been bigger because it was hard to keep everything on the plate--or maybe I shouldn't eat so fast! Our entrees were absolutely delicious. I had such a hard time choosing because of the variety of the pastas and pizzas. My hubby ordered the cacciatore pasta--tender chicken, sweet peppers in a zesty sauce on linguini--he loved it. I had the garlic shrimp with a delicious cream sauce with mushrooms and sundries tomatoes. Add the bread to sop up the goodness and they had one happy couple.  Cannot say enough how perfect this restaurant was. The ambience, friendly staff, cozy booths and of course the food, started our date night beautifully. We will definitely be back!

Meh! Babbos you're killin me! This used to be one of our favorite restaurants but two times in a row now it's just been rough. I get it, you have a sweet spaghetti and meatballs deal on Tuesdays so everybody and their mom comes for cheap food. That's great for business, but sorry to say your service suffers and regulars like us feel pushed aside for the extra bucks you're getting from the cheapskates...er I mean more frugal clientele. You sat two groups before us that had arrived far after us because you "accidentally" scratched us off the list. After  a quick and insincere apology (much more appreciated if you actually look at the customer), we got our table. Fine. But then we were rushed through a very underwhelming dining experience. Cocktails arrived after appetizers. We couldn't even enjoy them because the entrees came immediately after our appetizer--my biggest petpeeve ever! I would like to at least taste my appetizer before the entree please! I was really looking forward to the new roasted red pepper pasta dish with the added shrimp. It was just ok. You could tell it was quickly thrown together with some shrimp tossed in at the end. Such a shame because there is so much more flavor to be had there. I'm not sure if we will be back this time. We loved this place but the inconsistency is wasting our money. But just one final word of advice, when the entire meal is quicker than the wait time, that's a problem. It's a sit down restaurant, not a cafeteria.

Awesome Awesome Awesome!! Michelle, thank you so much for the amazing facial and microdermabrasion. It was my first one and I was a bit nervous and she made me feel right at ease. My skin feels wonderful and I loved it so much I purchased a bundle pack so I could go again and again. She has a first time customer discount and her rates are beyond reasonable. Thanks again!

Yummy!! Thought we would try their namesake and get two carne asada burritos to try it out. These were really good! The meat was seasoned well (maybe a little too salty but still tasty) with fresh pico and a nice layer of guacamole. The tortilla was nice and chewy, just the way I like it. There was a very nice man working the window, so customer service was great too. We will be back.

Loved this place!! Thanks to groupon we went off our beaten path and tried this place out (we are seldom west of valvista!). My husband has been on a chile relleno quest so the minute I mentioned restaurant had one on the menu, he took a left and headed straight over.   First of all, the place is gorgeous on the inside with high ceilings, beautiful decor and nice looking bar. We came at 4 for happy hour and sat in the restaurant area, which was understandably a bit empty that early. Fine with us, we had great attention and speedy service.  We started off with a couple margaritas, salsa, guacamole and something called Papas Bravas. The spicy red and green salsa was on point with great flavor and kick...bout time someone's not afraid of spicy salsa! The guacamole was nice and chunky and those potatoes...wow. Covered in a nice and spicy red chile sauce and cooled down with a sour cream sauce, these were delish! Only thing I thought was throw some chorizo in there and they would be epic.   We next ordered the hub's relleno. We got the one stuffed with the pork Adovada. I'm used to rellenos battered but this one was grilled and wrapped in a fried egg. I would prefer the batter myself but my husband said this was the best he'd ever had. And actually, with that tender pork inside, I would have to agree. We of course took advantage of the dessert menu and got the fried banana thing...crispy, sweet an drizzled in caramel and chocolate. Can't go wrong with that.  To sum it up, we had a great time. Wonderful food, awesome and attentive service, and we appreciated the owner stopping over to see how we enjoyed it. We will most definitely be back!

This place has by far surpassed any other thai restaurant I have tried in the valley--yes, even the popular Thai chili. I happened to stumble in after a long shift at the hospital (it's right across from Banner Baywood) with quite a nasty cold. The sweet waitress suggested the tom yum soup. Fantastic!!!! Hot, fresh, with the tang of kaffir lime, large prawns, and a huge kick. My husband, who joined me for dinner, loved this as well. We also ordered the thai spicy noodles with beef. Those luscious flat noodles were just layered with tender beef, sweet peppers, and garlicky spicy goodness. We ate everything and despite being full with runny noses, we ordered dessert! My husband tried the fried bananas, which were tasty but what topped that was my dessert. I'm a huge fan of sticky rice with mango and to my disappointment mango was out of season. The sweet waitress asked the chef who came up with something just as wonderful: sweet sticky rice with coconut icecream topped with plum seeds and peanuts. OMG!! The dessert was heavenly but I was more impressed with whatever genius they have working in the kitchen. Everything was so fresh, beautiful, and delicious! I'm concerned that nobody seems to know about this place. I would stand out in the street and direct traffic just to keep them open!

Awesome job! I brought our man-child here for his pre senior picture haircut and shave...our kid had a huge head of hair and full beard, think Teen Wolf. Tony took care of us and did some great work. The shop is clean, he took his time and even had a good conversation to our son (who is autistic so that really was greatly appreciated). We found our new barber today. Thanks Tony!

Hands down the BEST tandoori chicken we have ever had! Every dish we tried was so fresh, flavorful and full of spice. The owner and server were very accommodating and welcoming. He took our requests for "sinus clearing" hot and delivered just that! The naan was perfectly cooked with that delicious bit of char on the ends and the nice bite of garlic. The lamb vindaloo was spicy and we were pleasantly surprised with the generous portion of lamb. Everything was superb and we are already planning our next visit! Thank you!!

Disappointing experience today! We love Total Wine and usually go to the one in Gilbert. That store is full of helpful employees who are eager to talk to you about their faves. From the time we walked in the store this morning (I think they had just opened) we felt unwelcome and in the way. We didn't need any assistance as we knew exactly what we wanted, but the employees stocking shelves seemed annoyed by our very presence as we looked around after finding what we came for. Nobody smiled! In line, the cashier named Linda was giving a customer a hard time about her ID (not having the right one ect), but the girl was just buying a soda before her shift at another store. I understand there's a policy but she was icy. The girl walked out because she didn't have time to wait for the manager. Once the manager came and found out the girl left she just rolled her eyes and shrugged. Guess they don't care about their customers ever returning. When it was our turn, before I could open my wallet, Linda said gruffly "IDs, both of you."--like we were high school punks she was about to bust for fake IDs. We are well over 21. A "hello, how are you?" would've been nice. She didn't smile, didn't ask if we found everything ok. Just acted like we were just one big inconvenience. Needless to say, we won't be back, but sadly, I don't think they would care.

I wish the food sucked because then it would be easy to just never eat here again. But alas, after 3 horrid deliveries, we are just done. Strike 1--ordered from beyond menu and three hours later we had cold, soggy food (that had great flavor, but still!!). Strike 2--after being told to just call and order for quicker service, it still took over and hour to get our food (warm and delicious. Yum!!). Strike 3-- After an exhausting day working in heart surgery yesterday I decided not to cook a nutritious meal for my family and order yummy cheesesteaks. It was 730pm and we were hungry and I was tired. The gentleman taking my order was so nice and he quickly gave me my total, card was accepted, winning!!!---until he said "that will be there in 90 min". WTF?! So no supper until 9pm? Huh?! He did tell me I could drive down and get it in 10 min. Sure buddy, if I wanted to drag my exhausted, germ ridden body off my couch and drive all the way there, I would've just cooked! To make matters worse, he said the money wouldn't be returned to my card for 3-4 business days. Sigh... It was turkey sammies for this crew last night. Please please get your delivery in shape or just don't offer it. You're losing customers.

To sum it up in one word: IMPRESSIVE! We are loyal customers of The Hub (another one of their restaurants) so we were eager to try this new venture. It sits on the golf course at Augusta Ranch with gorgeous views of the water and greens--unexpected wildlife too with a lone coyote wandering the course! The place has a feel of a welcoming neighborhood bar mixed with an upscale country club with creative designer cocktails (try the grapefruit shocker omg!!) and eclectic snacks and sandwiches that made this foodie squeal with delight.  We had the meat and cheese board which had a wonderful mix of delicious artisan cheeses, Italian meats and pickled vegetables. This was definitely on par (no pun intended, well maybe a little) with anything at a 5 star restaurant. We also had a couple of "Smashies" which are their version of a panini and those were delightful as well. Hub fans will see some familiar items, such as the smoked wings, but again they knock it out of the park with the new Watermelon flavor--sweet and savory with just a hint of melon. Everything we tried was just a scale above everywhere else. It is also important to note that the management and the staff were awesome. The manager Chad and the waitress Nicole made us feel so welcome and even recognized that we were regulars at the Hub.  We had such a pleasant lunch on their patio and will definitely be back.

You take a burger and stuff it with all sorts of stuff, you get 5 stars from me. Why? Well for one, it's delicious duh! And two, I have never been able to successfully make one of these without the contents spilling all over my grill. My hubby and I pulled in here on a whim tonight and we're happy. He had the southwestern which was ooey gooey with cheese and green chilis. I had the jalapeño popper which had my fave combo of cool cream cheese and spicy fresh jalapeños. Yum! We had a side of the green chili Mac and cheese bites--nuff said. The kids working there were so nice and welcoming, we will definitely be back!

This place was amazeballs!!! The chicken damn near made me emotional because it was almost as good as my mamas. The waffles were so delicious and that grape kool aid/gin concoction made me feel the need for a good nap. The menu is really extensive with a lot of excellent choices. But it was the service above all that will make us come back. Andria took care of us today and her hospitality and warmth was so appreciated. Her great sense of humor made us feel right at home. We will be back!

Best breakfast burrito in the valley! The tortillas are huge and homemade and every ingredient is fresh. I'm so thrilled at their new location on Guadalupe and Hawes. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious!

They had me at Blue Moon ice cream. Add mackinac island fudge to that and I'm half tempted to quit nursing and apply for a job. I've been gone from Michigan since 1998, but I fondly remember my favorite ice cream. I cannot believe I'm tasting it again. This place is awesome! The atmosphere is fun and cheery with the friendliest service I've had in this state. Logan blew me away with his upbeat attitude and huge smile. He also sang along to the oldies hits and made us all laugh. When we were done he came to our table to ask how we enjoyed everything. Can't wait to come back!!

Cute little wholesome place with killer soda concoctions, fresh baked cookies, ice cream, and cotton candy--yes!!!!! Service is very friendly (picture Brady Bunch/Partridge Family) and the restaurant is very clean. And the icing on the cake is *drumroll please* THEY HAVE DOLE WHIPS!!! I don't know how they got the recipe, but these taste just like the Disneyland treats people line up for hours for. Sold!!

To sum it up, I've had to change my order the last three visits (I've been here a total of three times) because they "are out" of something. Whoever orders for this place needs to step it up!  Cranky and uncaffenated

My uber cool brother recommended this place to me quite a while ago, only he goes to the mill ave one. I'm not cool enough for Mill, so I was happy to see one open here so I could try it. This place is relatively new so I expected the sketchy reviews, but don't let them scare you off--this place was great!   From the ridiculously impressive beer menu, to the addicting soft pretzels with beer cheese (get these NOW!) and then on to the stellar pie, we loved it all. My husband and I rarely agree on pizza toppings, so it was awesome to be able to get half and half specialty pizzas without spending a fortune on extra toppings. We chose the Thai and the Potato, and for the first time we loved them both! I would say the Thai was our favorite. The curried chicken really stood out and the cool cucumber freshened it up nicely. Of course we drizzled sriracha for an extra bite. Yum!   Service was also top notch tonight. Our waitress was on point and the manager really impressed us with his customer service. He really took care of the table next to us that happened to get the wrong topping. Hey, mistakes happen, but it's nice to know they care enough to make it right. We can't wait to return!

WAFFLE BATTERED WINGS!!!!!!! Ok, got that out of my system, but stellar idea. Keeping in mind that this restaurant is brand spankin new, with only a few days under it's belt, we are so happy to have another restaurant close to home for our (hate to admit) weekly burger and beer fix. We were promptly seated by Angie, who also was our server. She was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the menu, which had some great choices! The manager Mark also took the time to check in frequently and asked our opinions on the food, atmosphere ect.  Atmosphere was your typical local sports bar with a country feel. Lots of tvs, but what they do differently is they not only show sports, but old school music videos--you know, like from when MTV actually had music videos. The videos provided the background music. Awesome concept!!   We ordered an array of food to try everything. We had the Midwest cheese curds--Michigan girl here was impressed! The batter was light, the cheese was squeaky and the ranch was on point! Now back to the waffle wings. What a concept! The flavors were there of your classic chicken and waffles. My only suggestion would to season the batter and drizzle the maple sauce instead of coating the wings in sauce to keep them crispy. We also thought they needed more heat. Angie was more than accommodating and brought us some of their homemade "Diablo sauce"...they seriously should bottle this stuff, great heat and flavor there. We were also pleased with our sliders and buffalo chicken sandwich, but the star of the meal were the homemade tots. They would definitely get Napoleon Dynamite's approval!   I can't wait to see what this potentially awesome bar does in the next few months. We will definitely be back to try more!
