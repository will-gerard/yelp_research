Our server (red headed freckled girl) greeted us by saying a corporate mandated aloha which immediately creeped me out. I'd rather someone greeting me for the first time anywhere to be genuine. (Not her fault she has to). She asked if we'd been there before we said no it was our first time. She ran over the menu with us, most of which she's said so often that she rattled it off faster then I could understand. I picked the 2 meat plate. Ribs & sweet & sour chicken with a Hawaiian salad & rice. My wife got the 1 meat plate with ribs white rice & salad. It's was $26 which was kinda high. It took awhile for the food to come out when it did it was cold. The ribs were very chewy the flavor was ok, the sweet & sour chicken was super wet & the breading just fell off. Not very good. The salad was cold & both myself & my wife didn't like it. The rice was rice. I was offended by a table they had in the building that was talking about religion and God. I didn't understand it was a business that proselytized to their customers I don't support those types of businesses in the first place. Business should be kept out of religion & religion out of business. Now I'm not sure if they are trying to sell me Hawaiian food or recruit me, either way I felt uncomfortable. My wife didn't like anything on her plate and we went somewhere else afterwards to get something to eat that we would enjoy. We won't be coming back.

We came in and ordered food. It was my daughters first time there. She loved it I would've given a 5 star review but my waffle had a bunch of black hard things in it & our server kept leaving to mess with the jukebox. I've never been ignored for a jukebox before that was a new experience. This was my first time there I usually go to the Waffle House on university & the 101 & I think I'll just keep going there. Bree & Laramie are the best servers ever.

This use to be my favorite place to eat. I love steak & I've eaten steak everywhere and I've always enjoyed Outback steaks the most. More then Ruth Chris or any of the high end places I've experienced. The last couple times we've been here I've noticed some serious change in the quality of the 10oz ribeye they have served me. The steak is now leaner thiner & a lot more like a steak you'd get a place that doesn't specialize in steak. I'm very sad because I truly loved this place but this will probably be the last time we eat here. Back to Longhorn Logan's & now what use to be my 2nd favorite Texas Roadhouse.

The best pizza at a great price. Seriously the best place for lunch. I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to the pizza here. Today was my first time eating there & I can't believe how good the pizza is. I think I paid under $3 for a slice & a drink which is the perfect size lunch. $3 is a deal. The staff was friendly and super fast. I'm probably going to be there everyday for lunch from now on.

I've owned my house in their delivery area for 5 years I've ordered from them at least once a month for 3 years they still call me telling me they are confirming my first time order every time. When I've went in the employees where making Mormon Jokes right in front of me and I happen to be Mormon. They never deliver on time and the place when I've gone in is very dirty and the food handlers I've seen touch their face then the pizza. I only still order from here because there aren't many options in this area. Worst Pizzahut I've ever encountered.

Terrible gym horrible staff I HAD TO CANCEL MY BANK ACCOUNT TO STOP RECURRING DUES. I'm 40 Lbs over weight and the manger asked me if I was a trainer and Harrassed me for showing MY WIFE what we needed to do that day. Always feel uncomfortable there I live across the street but I'm going to 24 hour fitness off Dobson now and couldn't be happier.

I've eaten here before and I always try to support local businesses but  the owner/cook won't make my food the way I want. He was yells at his employee (non English speaking undocumented worker) then a server is screaming the whole time sitting at the bar making the environment stressful and tense we won't be back. A lot like southern Cali restaurants just super unprofessional.

I love this place. Feels like a restaurant you'd find in Venice Beach CA. With fast friendly service, great food & character. I love it & can't say enough good things about it. We need more places like this in our area.

I love this place! The food is incredible I've been here multiple times and have had many different things off the menu & they are all great! I've gone for brunch, dinner & just to party at night. It's my favorite place in old town. Partying here on the weekends is always fun! They play fun music that you can sing along too every song. The servers & bartenders are always welcoming & friendly & I just can say enough good things about this place!

I felt a need to warn people about how awful this places food is. The spaghetti & pizza are bland and terrible the best thing they have was their cheesy bread and that was still worse than any other places I've ever had. This place is garbage. Don't waste your money.

Best tacos in the state! Always a great time either happy hour or Sunday's day drinking on the patio. Friendly fun staff & super attentive. I'd be there everyday if I could. I'm there every Tuesday for the free beach cruiser giveaway. Oh! The DJs are great always playing the perfect mix for drinking on the patio!

Came here to chill and bowl. None of the balls have the right finger sizes which isn't that big of a deal. The thing that is ruining our night is the annoying guy on the mic calling himself a DJ. Completely messing up the atmosphere in this place. Called himself DJ Minty Fresh. Saying the song watch me isn't "real music" then playing pour some sugar on me asking everyone to sing for a prize. Get the fuck outta here! Terrible. If I come back it won't be for awhile & if they have another guy talking the entire time trying to be funny I'll never come back. Such a good idea for a fun place can get ruined by one person. Staff is clueless. The front desk guy just came to clear out area at the lanes & told just to "tip our server" to imply we don't tip. I've worked in bars 20+ years I tip 20% or more to the worst servers. Never coming back here. We are all adults here hanging out on a Sunday night after 10pm know your audience. Terrible place.

These are the greatest bicycles you can buy @ at a great price! Every time I've bought a bike I've dealt with the owner himself Gary who is always there and ready to help with whatever crazy bike I want to put together!
