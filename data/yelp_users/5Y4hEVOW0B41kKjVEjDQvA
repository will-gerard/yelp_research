Wine, bruschetta, friends, and Yelp was how I spent my Labor Day here at Postino's! I had the cabernet and tried four different types of bruschetta, which were all amazing (not a huge fan of the artichoke spread), but still loved them! $5 wine before 5 p.m. so make sure to head in early!   It had a very relaxed, chill atmosphere and comfortable seating options where you could choose table, high tops, booths, or even couches. Music was a bit loud, but still enjoyed the vibe.   Jet really made the experience here excellent. He took his time to give us the history of the restaurants and the management behind them. He gave us great recommendations of other restaurants under the same ownership that happen to be next on my list to try!

I highly recommend going to Judy's Alterations! I have been here in the past and have forgotten the great quality of work and reasonable pricing she does all done in a timely manner. I usually am on a time crunch and she works with me and gets my items done when needed.   There are dressing rooms provided if you need your clothes tailored while you are there, otherwise just bring them to the counter and she will pin it where you need. Great work and highly recommended for any sewing or alterations you may need!

I walked into this place with multiple items I needed sewn up. He told me to take a seat as he was tailoring a man's suit. After that he calls me to the counter, he starts going through the items and pricing them out. His prices were much higher than I anticipated. A small hole on a seam line was priced at $13 and I brought in about 8 items. Then I realized they only accept cash and you must pre-pay. That was a little weird to me because other places require payment upon pick up.  I ended up walking out and going elsewhere. Wouldn't recommend unless you are okay with higher prices and paying before you see the end product.

I visited here initially for a medical visit for my lab. Making the appointment was easy and they were able to take me immediately. The staff is very welcoming and the facility is clean and new.   They made my dog feel comfortable and eased my worries. Dr. Benjamin Savard clearly explained the testing that was needed. He walked me through the process; best and worst case scenarios, and treatment options with me.  He was able to answer all my questions and even demonstrated how to administer her medication.    Since it was such a great place, I now will be having her stay at their pet resort while I am out of town, instead of my previous plans. When leaving they also gave me an informational package, which included price sheet, brochure, Frisbee, bumper sticker, business cards, and foldable water bowl! Cute idea.   Great place and staff! Would recommend to anyone with pets.

A small group of coworkers and I went and enjoyed happy hour specials. Fleming's offers 5 options for cocktails, wines, and appetizers for only $6 until 7 p.m. Overall great food, atmosphere, and service. There were a few options for seating, but we chose to be seated inside at a booth, very comfortable and dimmed lighting. Attentive servers, dishes were explained well, and our glasses remained full.   Everyone had the pinot noir and couldn't just have one glass. When it came time to order food, we decided to try almost everything on their menu. The Sweet Chile Calamari is by far my favorite dish on the menu. It is a sweet, tangy chili glaze covering pieces of calamari mixed with sweet peppers strips and pepperoni.  The Housemade Burrata was my second favorite thing we ordered. Similar to tomato mozzarella but richer... It is a spreadable, soft cheese made from mozzarella and cream served with charred grape tomatoes, arugula, and toasted garlic crostini's.   We also ordered the Tenderloin Carpaccio was paper-thin beef tenderloin slices that were served with cheese, mixed greens, and baguette slices. The Roasted Butternut Squash was a great texture and perfectly cooked, but too sweet for my taste. The Pan-Crisped Pork Belly was loved by some of my coworkers, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Almost tasted like thick cut, chewy bacon with goat cheese.    Definitely will be back for happy hour!

What a great margarita selection! Their flavors are endless and Rachelle is always so helpful and attentive. Each time I've visited she would tell us flavors she can make that are not listed on the menu.   My friend and I made this our go-to spot every few weeks for margaritas and their amazing spinach queso dip (it's dangerously addicting). We usually sit at the bar or a high top to watch the games on the TV. Haven't tried anything else here, but definitely will next time! The great service and delicious drinks is what keeps us coming back!   Make sure to get the check in offer, the Groupon deal, or check you mail for coupons! Love that there are lots of ways to save at this restaurant. Will definitely be back!

What a hidden gem! If you haven't been here, make sure to add it to the top of your list! Very authentic French food, friendly staff, and excellent décor. I have yet to have a bad experience and have been coming here for about 4 years now. This spot is a tradition for my two friends and I every time we are all in town.   Their Lyon sandwich is one of my favorite items on the menu.  It has grilled chicken, mixed greens, Swiss, sundried cranberries on freshly baked bread. You cannot go wrong with any of their savory desert crêpes. I have tried just about every one of them and still cannot decide which is my favorite!   They are closed Monday's and it does get crowded so I would recommend going during off hours. I have never had a wait, but the tables are pretty close together. Overall great experience and will be returning again shortly!

Have been to True Foods at the Quarter multiple times, but this was the best experience and food so far. Our server Elizabeth was beyond helpful and gave great suggestions. She informed us of the option to do "half" servings of many things on the menu! It allowed us to order more variety and try out different dishes. She recommended the Medicine Man to drink and was an excellent sparkling pomegranate and cranberry soda.  I started with half of the grilled chicken chopped salad. It is a sweet and light salad. We ordered the herb hummus to split and our server also brought us some fresh vegetables to enjoy with the hummus.  For dinner, our server recommended the fresh fish of the day, which was a flaky sea bass. It was served with green beans and antioxidant-rich purple potatoes. Asked for the sauce on the side, but ended up loving it. Loved this dish.  For dessert, our table shared the flourless chocolate cake and the strawberry rhubarb crisp. The chocolate cake was a chewy, and reminded me more of a muffin than a cake. It was okay, but nothing special. The strawberry rhubarb crisp was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream on top was amazing! It's a must try!  Elizabeth made this dining experience memorable and great! Will be back and hopefully seated at her table again!

Have to say this is by far one of my favorite restaurants and often go for family celebrations! The staff is always accommodating and friendly. The bar area is a great ambiance and provides live jazz music. The dining area is cozy and more intimate atmsphere.   Each time I go, I can't stay away from their North Atlantic Lemon Sole. It's a huge portion (even I can't finish it all) and it is decently priced.  It is the perfect combination of herbs, lemon, garlic, all with a parmesean crust and flaky fish.  If you go you definitely can't leave without trying their raved about Banana's Fosters! Not only is the taste incredible, but also the presentation speaks for itself. It is a moist butter cake topped with caramelized bananas that is then set on fire with a rum and brown sugar mixture. You think that's it, but then you taste the toffee ice cream... Safe to say it's heaven.

What I really did like was the convenience of the to-go option and parking. I was in and out in the matter of 5 minutes. Although it was convenient, the chicken lettuce wraps were bagged without the lettuce cups. I noticed when I got home and ended up just eating it with a spoon. Even then I thought it was too heavy on the sauce and was extremely salty.   Not bad for a quick dinner, but don't think I would rush to eat here again.

I have been a repeat customer for many months now and go at least once a week. It is definitely a more expensive place, but so are all healthy and organic options. Their ingredients are fresh and staff is always prompt. Even with a line, you are sure to get in and out within a few minutes!   I have ordered their smoothies, juices, and food. Hard to narrow down my favorites but I never leave without grabbing their pre-bottled "Power" (spinach, kale, apple, lemon) and "Wellness" (carrot, strawberry, apple lemon) juice! Those two taste amazing and are the perfect consistency.  The smoothies are more like meal replacements and I haven't tried one that I didn't like yet!  As far as food goes, I have only tried their Tokyo Bay, which was pretty great. The only issue I've heard is the amount of food crammed inside the box, but let's be honest... Who doesn't want more food? They definitely make sure you get your money's worth; although sometimes I wish it was less rice and more protein.   Their Grabbagreen application has been a great way to order food and have it ready to be picked up when I arrive. It's very easy to use and navigate between the menu options. Only problem I had was there was no place to redeem a gift card at checkout... I have mentioned to the staff, but nothing has changed. Regardless, great idea if you are in a hurry!   Noticed there has been an improvement in the staff and their customer service lately which I hope doesn't change!
