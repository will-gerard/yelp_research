Got the filet and it is so good! Alan got the salmon and he loved it! Way better than outback! Plus there is such a great vibe here. There is quite a few people in here but it's not over packed at all. Amazing service with amazing food! Try it once it speaks for itself!

Didn't even look at my clothes... I had expensive Guess dresses and a coach bag. She said they could tell which coach bags are fake... I have a $450 receipt for my coach bag. Rather donate it then sell it to them.

My daughter loooooves it here!! I did so much research before picking a daycare for her and this place is affordable and exceeded my expectations!! The staff is sweet and they love kids!! If your crazy like me and needed to find a daycare that was safe, affordable, and trustworthy try this place out!

Absolutely amazing! Paul worked on my car, did what was only needed and didn't try to up charge me on anything that wasn't needed! If your looking for a place that won't rip you off and get the job done right and quick come to this place! I would give this place 10 stars if I could!

Omg I absolutely love this company! It was the first REAL day of summer and everyone was booked! I called on a Saturday day without even realizing that it shows them as closed and no one picked up, but he CALLED ME BACK and was able to come over in 45 minutes to help us with our AC! He was the owner and he was just so nice! Honestly amazing experience and I would HIGHLY recommend them!

Only reason this place isn't getting one star is because I love watching the game on all the tvs. Me and some friends came in and the food took FORVER to get their. She forgot lemon, I ordered a salad and it was probably the most disgusting salad I've ever had. The lettuce was soggy and it tasted so old. The onion rings are usually pretty good. The service is SO bad! They stand around chit chatting instead of tending to customers. Honestly it gets worse every time so we've been going to native. Instead of hiring pretty girls hire people who can take a proper order.
