This is the ONLY place to get Chicken Fried Steak! The portions are HUGE so bring your appetite. The pulled pork is good too! Just took some visiting friends this last week and it was delicious as always. They loved it. These guys are very consistent and the service is excellent! The have a cool little bar too. Not really for families... this is for the grown-ups!

I am petrified of chiropractors. But I have suffered back pain for years and the doctor prescribed pain pills which kept me in a fog. The Activator Method is not your typical bone-crushing experience. I was apprehensive on my first visit but once I went through the process, I was really happy about it. Dr. Peterman is a genuine caring person and I appreciate what he does to make me pain free. If anyone has a fear of chiropractice methods, this is the solution. I feel great and no more pain pills!

We had purchased the Romance package at the resort which included in room breakfast or breakfast at this restaurant. We decided to walk to the restaurant and it was worth the time. We had the brunch and it was very good. The fruit and food selections were fresh and tasty! I live in the area and will be back for this brunch! Service was very good as well and the restaurant looked very clean to me.

I had my first experience here last Friday night. The service and food was excellent. Things started out a bit shaky as they had a very loud wedding party in the dining room and I was concerned it would ruin the evening. Luckily they left about 20 minutes after our arrival and the rest of the night was perfect. I am a fan and I will go again!

This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one.

The place is clean and the donuts are very fresh. I am a fan of their muffins. They use plenty of walnuts on the banana nut muffins! I bought a batch for the offcie and I was the hero of the day... just that day (Lol). From my observation though, they are pretty busy so you better get there early if you want to have a good selection. Nice staff too!

I've been to a lot of airports and I have to say that I think Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is probably one of the most user friendly. They need to do some work in baggage claim, with better signage and maybe see what can be done to speed up luggage delivery, but the gate areas and shopping are pretty darn good. I like parking in the garage but it's a bit pricey for me and the economy lot parking shuttles are too slow for my taste. So I either get a ride or use an off airport parking lot as they seem to be faster. if you have a long lay over, there is plenty to keep you entertained while at Sky Harbor.

I had a bit of an emergency situation present itself with my dog and this place was recommended by a friend. I found the entire staff to be very nice and they listened to my concerns. Especially when I told them I did not have a lot of money. They did not charge me any emergency fees and they took exceptional care of my doggie. Dr. Joiner was super caring as was Edith at the front desk. It cost a bit more than a Banfield but I think it's worth it. I prefer to have a relationship with my vets and doctors and these folks rose to the occasion. The tech, doctor and office admin all came out to say good-bye to my dog. I look forward to returning for the follow up in two weeks. They CARE!

I had some issues develop with my dogs stitches after the surgery. The vet was very responsive and asked me to come in right away. I feel like they really care. No charge for the visit either.

Me and the beau were in the mood for a salad bar this weekend so we stopped at this place. I was very surprised how fresh and clean everything wash. The service from our bus person was very good. The casahier was very friendly and explained the process to us. She even gave us a couple of coupons for our next visit. In addition to having a wide variety of salad "fixins", they had a large selection of soup, pasta dishes and desert. We had more than our fill and we will definitely go back!

This is my third visit to this restaurant and I really like the. The service was excellent, the restaurant has always been clean and the Kung Pao Chicken was delicious. I'm hooked and I highly recommend it. It is very nice inside, a good place to take a date...

I have used this car wash service as well as Danny's in the past. After a couple of years, I have decided Desert Auto Wash offers the better service. I think the prices are reasonable and I am satisfied with the cleanliness of my car each time.

The service and staff was great. I thought the food was not what it normally is. Maybe it was an off day. One of the staff members said the manager watches the bar on the installed cameras when not there. I think there should be signs letting people know they are being watched. They said the manager calls if he sees something that is against policy. Not a place for me any more.

Went to Danny's Car Wash on Sunday and bought "The Works". Apparently, that means half the works... gave them a tip, jumped in the car and left. When I got home and got into the truck on the passenger's side, they had not touched it! They forgot to do 1/2 of the inside! I guess they do not have a Quality Check procedure at this place. This was my first experience with them. I think I'll go back to using my regular guys as they always do a good job. I was disappointed in the service but it would have taken longer to go back that just wiped it all down myself.

I was thinking that a Gyro sounded good for lunch today on my morning commute. I was running my errands at lunch time and happened to drive by George's Gyros.  I decided to check it out. The young gal at the counter was very nice and took my order. I watched as meals were delivered and the portions were huge compared to ther Gyro places in the valley. I order the "Original" Gyro and not only was it a lot of food, but it was very tasty! I'm adding this to my list of places to grab a Gyro! Also, the menu is very extensive. I highly recommend you go and check it out!

I spend Friday evening at Bogey's as a friend was celebrating his birthday. The Happy Hour specials were priced right with a $4.00 charge for a small pitcher of Shock Top. Good Stuff. I decided to eat something so I ordered the quesadilla appetizer with chicken. I was surprised that it was so tasty! My friends all had the Friday night special, all you can eat fish and chips. The place was very busy but the service from our gal was completely acceptable. I wish we had a place like this in the north valleys! I would be a regular. I recommend Bogey's for a night out with the gang!

I went with a friend who told me I was going to love my experience. AND I did. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. The service was exceptional and everything looked so good. The restaurant was very clean. I highly recommend you try this place. I live in north Phoenix and will make the trek to eat at this excellent restaurant.

My experience here was excellent. The waitress was very attentive and made us feel very comfortable. She was very friendly and answered all of our questions patiently. The salsa rocks and the draft beer is cold! I really liked the place and the staff. Yes, the girls are beautiful (with fake boobs) but the food and service was first class. I will go back and I do recommend the place. It's also very clean!

I saw the car wash on my way to work. This is really convenient for me. I bought the $25 a month package with unlimited washes. I will save about $30 a month in washes and I can go through the wash whenever I want. I can still make it to work on time since it only takes me 4 minutes to go through the process from start to finish. The staff is clean cut and as a woman I feel safe there. Try it, you'll be glad you did!

They offer the best pot pies I have ever had! Placing an order for the office today... 9 pot pies! it is well worth the drive and on Friday they make a lean beef pot pie. Yum! The turkey pot pie is the best in my opinion.

Rented a room for the night as we went down to look at property in the area. Beds were fine but there were a lot of bees in the room. Smelled very musty and old. TV did not work as well as remote had dead batteries. It's okay to stay if you need a place to lie down... but this is below the level of a Motel 6.

What I like best about this place is that the owners are front and center most of the time. I like that they care enough to come out and meet their customers. I purchased a new leather riding jacket and they were very patient with me and let me try on all the different styles so I could get the absolute best fit. Also, whoever their buys is has very nice taste as the shirts and other accessories are all very classy. I signed up on their mailing list and they send me information on special and 20% discount cards all the time. One time, I received a free pair of sunglasses with my purchase... pretty cool cuz I seem to be good at losing glasses!  Anyway, I do recommend you check out this store if you are looking for riding gear. The staff is always very welcoming and the prices are very fair!

I had lunch at Papi Chulo's yesterday and I must say I was impressed. I had the enchiladas with the green sauce and the sauce was delicious! I also liked the chips (warm) and salsas they gave us. I eat mostly mexican food and they have earned my business. The service was very good. We had a waiter and a gentleman, possibly the manager that was checking to make sure we were satisfied. It was during the lunch hour, and while they were busy, they managed to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. They gave us lunch club cards with 5 punches already in each one. So onyl two more lunches and we get a freebie. I may become a regular here... they also have a private room for networking and private lunches.

I try to be a positive person but our experience here was not good. The food was mediocre at best and the service was awful. Watched our waitress stand and converse with someone for 15 minutes and we all had empty drinks. I politely requested she bring us another round on my way to the restroom. When I returned to the table, my friends had cancelled the order as the waitress continued to have a personal conversation and went to the bar to order the drinks. They requested the check which took another 30 minutes. Bad food + bad service = no return. They need stronger management here. Had they been around they would have seen what was happening. There were several upset patrons. Terrible service.

I really have a great deal of respect for JJ and his team at C & R Tire. They gave a me tremendous deal on my tires and now I am having them service my truck 100%. They are honest and do not make recommendations on repairs that are not necessary. As a woman, I feel these guys are genuinely interested in my business and care about my vehicle and safety. Try them, you will be pleased. I have been treated poorly at Fletchers... but they lost my business and now C&R wins!

JJ and his team are true professionals. I needed a service and was having some trouble with fluid leaks under my truck. He determined it was a broken seal, called a dealership and arranged for me to get it fixed under the powertrain warranty. He saved me a lot of money and was very thorough in evaluating my vehicle. They also gave me a ride home and picked me up which was really nice. I am happy to have found a shop I can trust! Seems rare these days.

I've now been here twice and both times everything went well. The appetizers are very good and they put on a nice buffet for the Cheerz 4 Charity event I attended. I will definitely put this place on one of my "favorites" lists. Good ambiance and very tasty food choices!

I tried this place a couple of times after seeing it on Yelp. Honestly, their shuttle service seemed slower than my regular place. Nothing special going on here, at least to me. It's kind of in a strange place and I had to battle the construction on 143 to get there.Also, I asked about getting a corporate rate and they told me I do not qualify (even though I fly almost weekly). They did mention that they might consider extending me a corporate rate if I gave them my client contacts (I'm in the printing business). I couldn't even come up with a response but I do think that is somewhat unethical. I think I'll stay put with my regular company. They take good care of me. They gave me a dynamite rate without any questions. If it ain't broken, no need to fix it! Lol

The chef is to be commended. Considering there are no meal items over 475 calories, the food is delicious. I had the chile relleno appetizer with goat cheese and pico de gallo. It was perfect! I followed with the pork tenderloin entree and Wow!!!! Another home run. The service was a bit slow, but they were really busy so I guess it was worth the wait. I will definitely be back and I do recommend you try Seasons 52 for a special dining experience.

This place is a lot of fun! The girls wear costumes and everyone is so friendly. When Dodey is there, she greets every customer and there is a feeling of community in there. Prices are very reasonable and they make good Bloody Mary's! Can't describe it totally but you should go and get "initiated". It's too funny. I like to take new friends in and watch their reaction. I wouldn't call this a "dive bar". It's clean. Maybe a neighborhood bar? You decide!

I stayed at this hotel while working a special event in the neighborhood. I was exhausted when I got back to the room and was worried I would not be able to sleep (strange place). Well as it turned out, this hotel was one of the nicest places I have ever stayed, and I have traveled all my life. To start, the room was immaculate. Everything I needed was there and plenty of towels too. Then I noticed I could hear nothing, no noise from outside. It was soundproof so all the noise from the lobby area and the cars passing by was gone. The bed was awesome and I really enjoyed the goose down pillows. I had a nice complimentary breakfast in the morning and a quick check out by the friendly hotel staff. The room was a suite with a full kitchen and I enjoyed some coffee in the morning as well. The internet was free too which I have had to pay up to $15 a day at some places before. This is just a great value for your money at this hotel. I heard less traffic in the room than I hear in my home in North Phoenix! I highly recommend this hotel for business or family/friends that may be visiting. it was a 5 star experience.

I called to pick up Turkey dinner as I was down there to visit my elderly parents. I was told they had sold out on their regular dinners so I had to buy the "Deluxe" dinner for an extra $30.00. The turkey (Cajun) was awful (terribly salty) and we threw out more than half of it. They rest of the meal was acceptable but I will buy from Safeway on my next visit.

I met a business associate here for lunch yesterday. They have only been open for two weeks so I was a bit apprehensive as to whether they have worked out the "kinks" yet. I was pleasantly surprised! The server was very attentive although the inexperience showed when after servicing us, she immediately returned to ask how our food was... we had not had time to take a bite yet! Lol BUT, the food was very good and I will definitely make this one of my luncheon spots to meet clients. I had the enchilida stack. Very tasty. The bar is huge and I think it would be a great place to meet up with the gang to watch a game or hold a mixer. It is clean and the staff is very courteous... all of them have big smiles and lots of hellos and thanks yous as you depart. The prices are a bit higher than your average grill... but honestly, the food is worth it in my opinion. They are new to the game, so be patient and in a short while this place will be seasoned enough to compete with the rest!

I have noticed a real change in the staff at this Planet Fitness. They are starting to bring in much nicer "service oriented" employees. I actually look forward to going and being greeted with a friendly Hello and a big smile. Kudos to the management for hiring some really down to earth friendly individuals!

Heard about this place from my neighbor. I never would have stopped, but I am so glad I did. It's inside the Shell station on the SE corner of 7th Street and Union Hills. They have some tables for dining but also offer delivery service. I had the breakfast burrito and it was delicious! The gal at the register was very sweet and nice as well as the cook came out to make sure we were happy. I'm giving 5 stars for price, quality of food, and superb customer service.   This is a great place to grab a weekend breakfast, work day lunch, or some take home dinner if you're not in the mood to cook. They are closed on Sundays.  They will see me frequently! :)

So happy to see Preppy Pet open in by neighborhood. I have struggled to find a place to watch my dog that was affordable and that I felt my dog would be properly loved. I met Sue, the manager and knew I could trust her. I travel to Flagstaff frequently throughout the year and it is hard to take my dog, stay in a hotel and work. This is a life saver for me and the location is perfect for a drop off as I head north. Everything is very clean and they have good climate control. Also liking the video camera log-on system so I can see what my girl is up to when I am away. They even have dog grooming so I can get that done all in one stop. I recommend you check them out if you have a need for day care or boarding. Nice people!

So it's been a year and this place is still rocking. Sue is amazing with animals. The set up is really good and the camera program is really neat. No matter where you are on your trip, you can log in and see your dog playing. It used to be stressful to leave my dog with someone. Based on how excited my dog gets when she sees Sue, I know she is in good hands. Try it... you'll be happy you did.
