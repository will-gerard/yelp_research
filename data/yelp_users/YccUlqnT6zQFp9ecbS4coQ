If I could do a quarter star, I would. I've never been so disrespected in my entire life! We waited for over an hour to get seated and then when that happened, we were "cut off". The manager had no idea what he was doing, but was adamant that we were unable to drink. After waiting an hour and being treated that way, we walked out before ordering food.  I've lived in NYC for over 4 years and literally never experienced such disrespect in my entire time there. I actually know respectable pizza restaurants and this isn't it.

Prestige Cleaners is the worst dry cleaning business I've ever used. They charged me an insane amount to dry clean two coats and then ruined one of them. Then to top it off, they refused to pay to replace it and said they would send it to the manufacturer. I literally dropped it off in December 2014 and still haven't heard from them in June 2015. I can promise you that I won't be back.

I love the decor of this place. It has a contemporary Mexican feel.  The food was delicious.  We ordered the corn, queso, and tacos.  Everything was delicious and very unique...not the usual traditional Mexican food.  I recommend it!

I wasn't impressed with Kelly's as a restaurant.  Half of the menu was unavailable while I was there because they were in the middle of changing it.  Everything I wanted was not available.  Once I received my food, it wasn't the best either.  It was a sandwich.  How hard is that to make?    Anyway, this place is better for drinking and going out, not eating.  All of the old town people go here now, so it's one of the new hot spots.  I'm not sure I love the crowd though.  It's filled with bitchy girls and douchebags.  Check it out for yourself if you'd like.
