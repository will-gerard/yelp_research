Excellent food! The spinach dip is simply the best appetizer you can get anywhere and everything on the menu is delicious. I think its important to be consistent and this place nailed it. I have been going to this Houston's location for 12 years and i can be found here at least once a month but usually more. The fact is Houston's defined prime rib for me and has been my favorite restaurant at its price point ever since.

Horrible service, arrogant employees and too busy for you. Scheduled me 3 weeks in the future because they were busy. I said ok but that i was concerned he would show up and need parts to set up my new network so they should come look first. They said no and I was assured he would have parts and worst case if he needed something be back much faster than 3 weeks. Been 2 weeks since they came out and couldn't do any work. They cant even find time to send a quote despite calling several times. Simple router and network set up job in 1500 sq ft home. Nice work Iwired - you are the epitome of whats wrong with service companies right now.

I really like this place for a healthy post gym meal. Its all about the Terriyaki light and if you can afford the calories - the egg rolls are the best i think ive had.

Great food every time, ABOVE AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE and a perfect atmosphere - this is how i would describe this old town Scottsdale spot. I am here at least twice a month and have been going for years. This place is dialed in. Try the Mustard BBQ Beef Ribs with fancy mashed potatoes - perfection.

This place has the best real-deal-this-aint-no-sissy-gourmet burger ive ever had. Its a lofty claim I know, but they can back it up. They also happen to have the fried zucchini that set the bar from which i now judge all other fried zucchini. This joint is no frills and dont expect a hug from the staff but the burger is legit. Definitely put this on your to-eat list yelpers.

This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!

This place is amazing - its #1 for me in the steakhouse category and its my go to spot when i want to have an amazing dining experience. Everything from the atmosphere, the service, the food all the way down to the location are perfect. If you want the perfect meal follow my menu - crab cakes, build you own surf and turf with chilean sea bass and the filet, au gratin potatoes, any green, and top it off with a WARM BUTTER CAKE!!! Food coma!!!!

Im currently the Duke here and I'm writing this review reluctantly but it's neccesary I think because as a loyal customer I have been let down too many times on recent visits. I have been coming here since day 1 but things have changed, the last few times I have been here its been on a steady decline. Finally my last visit I have had it. Service is the worst in town, employees have bad attitudes and don't care, always understaffed, didn't have small bills to give change from the register, dirty bar, dirty tables, undercooked cold chips, no attention from bartenders as drinks run out etc etc etc. I don't know what happened internally here but it's not the same as it once was. What was one of my favorite spots has become a sinking ship. Based on the information the employees readily complain about in front of their guests about management and staffing turn over I'll be surprised if this place makes it much longer. It's a sad thing. Food is still great though - if they don't run out of whatever taco you order.

Absolutely horrible service. I wont write a long review here because its not worth my time but I have 2 outstanding issues this company cant fix. Don't expect any customer service here and when a problem with shipping (which be longer than they quote) or a product (that will likely not come as you order) does arise don't expect them to treat you any better than any other much less expensive shop
