Based simply on the dessert... the MOST AMAZING and now my ultimate favorite dessert of anyplace, ever - the coconut cream pie.   I do not love coconut, and I do not love coconut cream pie - but there is something utterly amazing about this dessert that doesn't make me think of coconut. A great crust with soft filling, then cream on top, drizzled with something amazing and a thin wafer-cookie thing added. I realize this post is not doing this amazing dessert justice, but I highly encourage you to try it!!

I'm a chai tea addict, and Hava Java is by far the BEST chai tea latte I've EVER had. Even substituting soy still keeps it delicious. Love.

Love this neighborhood spot - one of my favorite local AZ restaurants. Staff is SUPER friendly and helpful - we almost look forward to seeing them as much as we do the food!  The cheesesteak with green chilly mayo is my favorite. Be sure to add the green chili mayo to anything your order! Their bread is fresh, and some of the best sandwich bread I've ever had - and you can order bread loaves to go. Great fries and you really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, and they usually have some unique desserts that are quite good. They also do pizza - I've never had it, but my family has and they all had good things to say.   A must-do if you're in Gilbert or close by!!

Not a huge menu, but it's definitely filled with some great options!   We had:  - Chicken salad sandwich (quite good, would recommend).  - New Yorker - also good, but perhaps better to eat that in than take out - the bread can get a little soaked if it sits.  We often visit Vermont Sandwich company across the street - also good. Relative to this, The Lunch Bag seems to have slightly smaller portions, but also less expensive than Vermont. The chicken salad is pretty comparable, but I might edge out TLB over Vermont for that one.... :)  Wished they had the almond cookie the other reviewer raved about, but guessing it was lighter options today since it's the day before Thanksgiving and I assume they'll be closed for the next 4 days.  Originally wanted the hot ham & cheese, but they were out of ham :( - again, guessing it was just due to the upcoming holiday/being closed. As a make-good, she did give me a free brownie!  Super friendly service nudges this to 5 stars.

I had originally posted a 5-star review, but have now retracted it. While at The Brake Shop to have my brakes inspected, I also asked for an oil change and tire rotation. After they drained the oil, they realized they didnt have the proper oil filter, and could not locate one. They added some oil back in my 2012 Audi, and replaced the oil filter.  When I went to Jiffy Lube the next day, the service guy there wouldn't touch it - there was oil all over the engine. I had to immediately go to the nearest Audi dealership, where they stated that either the oil filter was replaced improperly, or an incorrect oil filter was used. Had I driven any longer, this could have cause severe damage to my 1 yr old Audi.  2 Stars because the store manager was very friendly, and didn't try to upsell me anything. Negative 3 stars for the poor garage staff.

So long as they have the Carnitas tacos, you're in luck. Truthfully, all the meals we've had here are great (didn't love the mac & cheese though), but the best are the Carnitas tacos. Get there early though- the last two visits they ran out, and it was only 6:30pm! Last time we were lucky and they were able to get them for us after all, but they're in high demand, because they are de-li-cious.

Thank you Yelp for introducing us to Karsen's! Had an amazing lunch today - Green Mary Lou was great, and some of the BEST green chile enchilada soup I've ever tasted!! Very friendly staff/owners, and nice hidden gem. Small spot, but definitely worth trying (again and again)!!

Delicious burger (corn-fed) and Romaine Brie Salad - we split both, and it was a great meal, accompanied by sweet potato tots.

5 stars for the Blueberry Oat Bar - extremely delicious!!  4 stars for the customer service - despite a long line, it went very quick and staff was friendly. 3 stars for the chai latte - it was luke warm and I didn't really like the taste of it, despite the fact that I LOVE chai teas elsewhere.    Based on other reviews (and that delicious oat bar!) will be back to try other options.

Awesome happy hour deal - their house margarita is about $2.50 (I think that's right) - a total steal for a pretty tasty margarita, accompanied by some tasty tacos.

Update: IT'S BACK!! They brought back the southwestern fried chicken dish - our absolute favorite. 5 stars and back in the restaurant rotation! Thanks SanTan!!   San Tan used to be our favorite place to go - we LOVED the southwestern fried chicken meal, and it was the only reason we came here, but they've done a menu change, and our favorite is now gone :(   The rest of the food is ok, and beer is good. Sad that we won't be coming back... Until they bring back the SW fried chicken!!  We ate: Pub pretzel - good Shrimp & grits - very blah, didn't finish it. Heartburn in immediate effect though!! Buffalo chicken sandwich - too light on the buffalo sauce - sandwich had very little flavor. Ask for extra buffalo sauce!  Service was good though, do appreciate that :)

Scottish Eggs. Sausage salad. Pilgrim with turkey. The first 2 sounded a little odd the first time I read it, but glad we tried them - Soooo good. I could eat this combo everyday. Their sausage is DELICIOUS!! Some of the best I've ever had.

Great lunch special - delicious green curry, and pad thai is good, but FYI, even 'medium' hot is still hot (but good!) Egg rolls and soup were delicious - overall, the meal was great. Will say the Pad Thai wasn't as delicious today as other days, but still highly recommend Thai Rama.

Went for a pedicure and gel nails. With one $5 upgrade it was about $64 - a bit pricey for the services. The massage was also very light and very quick, and probably doesn't count as a massage.   The biggest downfall was that the tools and inside of the salon looked dirty. I snapped a pic of the gel UV machine - super dirty on the outside, and when I went to put my hand inside, there was sticky stuff all over the inside of the machine. I told the girl, but she shrugged it off. Not clean = not cool.

Had a horrible pigeon problem on our roof in Mesa, AZ. The bid PigeonPros provided was about 1/3 of what others had quoted, and they provide a guarantee. They thoroughly cleaned the roof, patio and outside areas and set up several deterrents and traps on the roof. Someone from PigeonPros still comes back each Friday to check the traps - today they had 3 more in the traps, and to date have caught about 24 - the majority of the birds. Haven't seen the birds be much of an issue, and after a few more weeks, I expect they'll all be gone. Money well spent, for a great job done. Highly recommend!

Service was great, and we tried several dishes - all were ok, but not great (did we order the wrong things??). The portions were VERY small and very pricey - $18 for 6 bites of food is never a good thing. Honestly - when we were done with our 3 small plates & 2 beers (and spent almost $100) we went across the street to Bianco to have a pizza - we were so hungry!!

If I ever need electrical service again, will always call Good Guys, and recommend them to family & friends. Professional, polite, honest and no up-selling, and a very pleasant experience. Pricing was great on the work performed. Highly recommend!!

Awesome ambiance, and great staff. Food was pretty good, too.   Had the brown bag chicken sandwich (good), and the fried okra (good). Also had the bacon cheeseburger and mac & cheese (both pretty good). Couples next to us ordered a sampler platter of some sort with shrimp - they both raved about it, as well as the custom style drinks.  $5 for a small(er) pitcher of good beers on Sundays - great deal. Lots of unique drinks, worth a try. Servers would awesome with recommendations and making their unique drinks.

Everything was delicious. Get help ordering from the staff- a lot of things on the menu you've likely never heard of, and we certainly had some food envy over the dishes on other tables!

Great deals on 1/2 priced bottles of wine on Sundays, and food is good - not great, but good. Good atmosphere to hang out, and the back patio is great once it's a bit cooler.   First time we went, food was burnt and had to send back; Manager apologized. Came back to give it a second shot, and was pleased.

Have been twice - would recommend it as a family outing. One tip - go in the winter/cooler months, and stay away during peak summer temps. Also, wear red (or other bright colors?) - red seemed to be a great draw to the butterflies, and several landed on me, but not others in our group wearing more muted colors.  Tickets are a little pricey - $42 for 2 adults (1.5 yr old was free). Amazingly, our 1.5 yr old sat through the movie perfectly, without wearing the 3D glasses. The atrium was super humid and a bit uncomfortable, but to be expected on a day where it was 115 out. During our first visit earlier this year, it was perfect temps inside the atrium - even with a (red!) sweater on.

Some of the BEST Spanish Rice I've ever had - usually not a fan of it in general, but tried it here, and LOVED it. Tacos are good as well, lots of options. Recommend getting several kinds, including the baja taco.

GREAT burgers - loved every last bite of the Goodnighter. Lots of options, all sound great.   A little overwhelming on your first visit, but the staff guides you to the right spots to order and sit. Fried were good, but not great. Will definitely be back through - fantastic burger and would love to try more of the menu and shakes.

Chicken Diablo pasta was very delicious - highly recommend. Also had the bowtie chicken alfredo, which was pretty good as well. Diablo was best though!  Service was a little slow/not ideal. She forgot our bread and salad until we asked, just as our entrees arrived. Salad had a good dressing, but nothing special other than that. Bread was not warm, and had 1 small sized piece - too small for sharing amongst the two of us, but we skipped it since it wasn't warm. Oil for bread came in a small plastic container - would have been nicer if it had been served on a plate.  This place would definitely benefit from a few nice touches - better silverware, plate for the oil/bread, better bread, paper for table coverings put in the back (instead of behind us while we ate), improved server skills. A relaxed environment, but next time we'll probably just do take-out.

Have been several times, and most recently booked a mid-day appointment for 5 people. Although we had a last minute cancellation and were down to a party of 4, they seemed to have no issue with that, and were extremely friendly and accommodating to our group, and it was very apparent that they appreciated our business!

I hate it when nail salons lie about the wait time, just to get you to stay. After being told 10-15 minutes, I gave up after waiting 20 mins because I knew the next available technician was still 5-10 minutes away from finishing her other client ahead of me (which would have resulted in a 25-30 min wait for me). Be honest about your wait time; if it's too long, I'll come back-- and I'll appreciate your honestly because it shows you respect my time. If you're dishonest about the wait (because I truly believe you know how long it'll take you to finish up a service), then you lose regular customers like myself.
