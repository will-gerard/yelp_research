Amidst one of the wealthier parts of the valley, Senor Taco is a gem because it provides excellent food for an exceptionally low price. Even during the busiest hours, orders are taken quickly and the food is made promptly, however, one can still plan on having a lunch meeting and not feel rushed. Those looking to eat very good Mexican food and save some cash have found the perfect restaurant.

Great food and quick service! Our waiter got all our orders correct and was quick to get our food out. The food was awesome and was well worth our night! The BBQ burger and white pizza are great choices on the menu.

Good food, but they charge $1.08 for a cup of salsa now... I always get extra salsa with my burrito and so I won't be coming here anymore
