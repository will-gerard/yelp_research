Thanks for the crappy wash guys. Second and last time I will bring my car here.  First time was pretty bad but I thought maybe it was the guys last day so I gave you a pass, this time was even worse. The only reason I'm giving you an extra star is because you have a Dunkin Inside and I like donuts.. People can get the same wash for $5 at a gas station and air dry while they drive home.  Guys here are a few tips for you   1. You are moving the car from the back of the building to the side of the building, there is no need to touch every adjustment on the seat and get comfortable and fuck the seat up for the owner of the car! God forbid the guy moving the car is not comfortable for 10 seconds of driving. There is also no reason to put on your fav radio station and turn it up. Chances are your customers are not going to like your taste in music or your seat settings when they get in.  2. Don't let cars sit in the sun after you wash them! This leads to water spots all over the windows and paint. Your staff can't even get bugs and dirt off the car, there is 0 chance they will get water spots off.   3. You are being paid to wash the car. If there are still bugs and dirt on the car you did not do your job.   4. Your customers should not have to walk around the car and show you how shitty your work is. If you do this for a living you should be able to see that there is still dirt or water on the car. Have someone who knows what dirt, bugs and water spots looks like check each car before you call a customer over.

Roma has been one of our go to restaurants over the past few years. They have changed owners and the business has not changed much but we did prefer the interaction with the previous owner. We enjoy the servers the most and they are the reason we frequent. They are engaging, funny and make going out to dinner fun. The food here has always been solid with the exception of a undercooked fish once. If you want non Italian there are better choices in the general area but they are on par with all of the other quality Italian restaurants. Closest option would be Nicks on Tatum and Shea.  Here are 5 quick things a new visitor should know about Roma.  1. Service is most likely going to be good. 2. The Italian food is very good. 3. Good atmosphere. 4. Prices are on the higher side for non Italian. 5. Drinks are pored correctly.

We have been coming here for a long time. Here is the deal. Food is always on point 5 stars. I recommend the filet, key lime pie, pork chop. Cesar salad "secret menu". Service we have never had a bad experience 5 stars. Drinks are made correctly 5 stars. The only 2 issues are as follows.  1. Pricing has gone up over the past 2 years. Used to be we could come here on a more regular basis and now it is more of a special occasion type visit. Not sure why the price hike but whatever it has not reduced traffic so it will most likely not change.  2. The wait sucks. If you walk in during prime hours expect 30+ min wait easy. We make reservations and usually wait 10-15 min past our reservation time. They have a great patio but do not use it? They have a large piano area and I have never seen anyone play that damn thing. You can add 4-5 tables if you get rid of that thing.  Highly recommended if you are ok with a wait and paying a little more than normal for a really good meal.

First off we have stayed at several Hampton and always had a good stay, this was not the case with this place.   This hotel seemed to be an old run down dump that had some sugar coating added to try and make it look nice but don't be mistaken it's pretty F up. I will say the only bright spot was the staff, very friendly and nice.   Now the room was a disaster. There was wall covering splitting and much of it looked dated and warn. The bed sucked. The plumbing in the walls was very loud. The room next door started the shower and it sounded like they were in our room. The fridge was broken and it made a high pitched noise all night which created a wonderful sleep deprivation chamber. Walls are super thin. The heater T stat was off. I guess you get the picture by now..  If you value your sleep find another hotel.

First rate breakfast joint in Scottsdale. We have been here 50+ times and I have yet to get bad service or a bad meal. Everything on the menu is very fresh unlike most places. The yogurt is fantastic mixed with fresh fruit, pancakes are great and they are one of the few that can do oatmeal correctly.   Add to your list of places to get breakfast if you have not been here yet.

Cornbread: good Drinks: good Service: good Street tacos: good  Trio appetizer: good   Always have a good time with friends here but it might be because I drink a lot.. Gets super busy around weekends but weekdays are usually no problem. Do not be afraid to sit around the bar if hungry during busy time as the servers there are really good. If you like to drink the Chambord Margarita is amazing and a must try.

I will give this Kona 4 stars. It was almost 3 based on my previous visits when we did happy hour on the patio and service was not real great. Our waitress seemed distracted during our visit. The food and drinks have always ben good and happy hour pricing is also good. Specialty drinks have been very good on our visits. Our last visit the California rolls, edamame and pot stickers were very good and our server Kristen made up for our previous visit server. She kicks ass.   The big ass TV over the bar helps if you want to visit during a sporting event. We got to watch cry baby LeBron in actual size sink the Bulls with a buzzer beater while getting our drink on, good times.

We come here 2-3 times a month and have yet to have bad service or a bad meal. We like the bar and most of our service has been from the bartenders. Pita jungle has the best hummus and pita we have had in AZ and the grilled chicken is very good. Bartenders mix drinks well and are friendly. Vegetarian or not they have a great selection for you and your plant and bean eating friends.   We have never done take out so I cannot comment on how good it is but it seems very popular as it fly's out the door all day / night. I'm not sure who does the hiring but they do hire attractive women so its a nice bonus if that matters on where you choose to eat :) extra star for the hiring.

Man this place is fantastic. We have visited twice and both visits were exceptional. The reviews do not lie. Friend told me about this place and now I have added another restaurant to my list of local favs. Beef medallions were excellent ! Chicken was great, burger was great, drinks were great, basically everything we had was 4-5 stars. The dining room is small but they do a great job with the room they have and also have a patio which helps.   Our server was heather and she was fantastic. Chef Michael visited our table and recognized we were in a couple nights before and not only asked about our visit but also thanked us for our business. Keep up the good work we will be back very soon !

Great shop with a professional, expert staff. The techs are skilled and quick with service. One of the few shops I have been to that have a good selection of bikes and accessories in the valley.  Come for the bikes, stay for the coffee and atmosphere..

If you like NY style pizza you will like this pizzeria. If you like that deep dish or sweet sauce crap keep looking. As far as NY style pizza is concerned they hit the mark. One of the best in the area. We usually take out so I can't comment on the service. One of our go to when we need our pizza fix.

This is a spot we have been to about 8 times. The secret to this place is know what to expect, when to go and what to order. There are only a few things on the menu you can order and not be totally pissed. If you plan your visit just right it can be ok. If you do not you will leave upset and have a 0 star experience.  Food:  Do order the pretzel and beer. Do order the Cesar salad. Do order the breakfast burrito. Do order the bread pudding. Do order drinks.  Do not order just about anything else. Most of the menu is void of flavor or correct preparation. Do not be tricked into item descriptions like Mac and cheese, pizza, burger etc.. It's a trap.  Service:   Do not come here if you like quality service and attentive servers. The servers are pretty bad. Most of the time I have to flag down our server to get refills on drinks. They usually do not give a shit about you or your needs.  Atmosphere:   Great building, Bar and patio. This is the real disappointment because with the right food and service this place could be very good. But even with a great layout you will be disappointed as the laid back pet friendly patio gets over run by kids who's parents use it as a Chuck E Cheese and let their kids run around screaming and yelling while they zone them out. It seems like this place has changed from an adult hang out to a kids playground on the weekend and is the last place you want to chill out with friends for a relaxing meal. This past visit we had a bean bag thrown onto our table and a glass broken next to us by a wonderful group of children who had been running around acting like wildlings all evening. If you are one of those inconsiderate parents who likes to turn your kids loose to annoy the shit out of others while you pretend not to know what they are doing so you can take a break from your unruly children and have a good time with like minded parents you will love it!

Best mountain bike shop in the valley. Best selection of top brands, good techs and friendly service. If you need a simple tune up or want to build a top of the line bike this is the place to visit. They also offer mobile sales, demo's and service which is a huge plus.

The food here is not good, it's excellent! Off the beaten path but very much worth finding. If you like sweets or want a great lunch or breakfast add this spot to your must visit locations.

I usually give a restaurant 2-3 visits before passing judgement. We have now visited Bonefish Grill 3 times. This is how it went down..  First visit: Made dinner reservation for party of 6. Arrived on time and was told by the army of staff standing at the front door that it would be about 10 min. We were sat in about 10 min. Once we sat down we waited about 10 min or so before a server asked for our drink order. Once engaged the service was ok. Everyone enjoyed their food from the Mahi to fish and chips and drinks but it was not a great visit as many items ordered were not brought to to the table including my salad. First visit had some bumps but I gave them a pass on these as I know sh@# happens sometimes. The table next to us was really pissed about something and it took what seemed like forever for a manager to come over and help a waitress who seemed to be on the verge of crying.  Second visit: No reservations made but we called while driving to the restaurant "5 min drive" and were told there was no wait. Arrived around 5PM and it seems about 20-30 people showed up in that 5 minutes as there was a small town of people trying to find somewhere to wait. We were told the wait would be 15-20 min so we took our pager and went outside to the patio. 10 min after sitting a server came over and offered us drinks. This guy was on it and did his best to keep us full of booze as we waited which is a good thing as it kept us from walking out. 40 min into our 15-20 min wait I noticed people that arrived after us started getting seated. I then went to the greeter and made mention that we are 20min past our original estimated wait time and that people that arrived after us were being seated. I asked a couple inside how long they had been waiting and they said 1 hr on a 20 min estimate by the host. The host then said we were next and it would be no more than 5 more min. 15 min later our pager went off. We were seated to a dining room that had many empty tables. Many of these tables were never filled during our visit and the waiting area stayed packed. Like our first visit the food was good. This time nothing was missed. We did however witness a couple tables around us get food very very late and I did see a couple complain to a manager so it seems that service can be hit or miss.  Third visit: we stopped by on a Friday night around 6pm and we were told the wait would be 60 min. Remembering our last wait this most likely meant that we would eat around 8pm so we went across the street where we had 0 wait and a great meal.   Summary: Good food, average service, poor management. Make sure you have a reservation on the weekend. This place really needs someone who knows how to run a restaurant to get the operation issues resolved. This place has 4-5 star potential.
