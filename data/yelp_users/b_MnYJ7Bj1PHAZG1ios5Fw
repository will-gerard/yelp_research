No stars!!! I had a service associate provide a case price for t8 bulbs and when I got to the register the management went out of their way to rescind that mark down. Nice unstick position and nice service. Top down leadership in action. No wonder it takes so long to get out of the store...people don't care and management doesn't want to help their customers.

Not usually a fan of short changing my ice cream experience with yogurt, but the experience, selection of flavors, updated flavors, topping selections, friendly service, and clean dining experience are fantastic. Not to mention my picky 7 year old loves to know she will enjoy her treat by sampling it first. The toppings are a story to behold when she gets going too. We have made this a regular haunt and bring friends and family there all the time. Keep up the good work.

Don't be convinced that bundling is convenient...this highly rated customer service company and I hope you notice the dripping sarcasm is horrible at customer service. Billing is a constant issue, overcharging for bundled services, yet mysteriously never undercharge when bundled services have miscellaneous charges. To attempt to address these issues their partnership companies decline responsibility and centurylink is all to happy to blame them. Your contract with them is up within a month and they are happy to re-sign you, but ask to unbundle service and it takes 3 months to accomplish. Service fees for everything even reconnecting things that aren't disconnected. 6 straight months of billing inaccuracies, credits with bundled companies ignored, yet they are happy to block those services, then service fee you to have those credits go to them. Ask to speak to a manager and they offer an escalation team - I asked for a manager. No understanding of customer service, but while you waist your life on hold they repeatedly tell you how great they are...if you have the audacity to tell me how great you are, at the very least you should provide mediocre service. This repeated service failure will never have me bundle again. I want the ability to tell a business how bad they are by taking my business elsewhere without disrupting or affecting my excellent service received from their partners. Do not be taken by bundling with them. You will only feel regret and notice it degrade your bundled service professionalism and exceptional services.
