We go to Fresh Wasabi a lot and usually it's the same thing...the service is not the fastest on the planet, but when you are there with good company you hardly notice. Their sushi is amazing and they have a perfectly priced menu. Love it!

My wife and I met up with some friends for a late dinner/get together type of thing. We each ordered a glass of wine, which was reasonably priced. I ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Baby Beets appetizer as we had eaten earlier and it was absolutely amazing! Next we decided to skip just to dessert. We attempted to order the bread pudding but they were out, but said they had banana pudding. My friend ordered that and I decided to get the huckleberry jam and lemon curd. My dish came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the waiter told my friend that they were actually out of banana pudding as well. That's embarassing. Overall, it was a good experience. I was surprised at the service for it being a Wednesday night. I would hate to see what they would be out of on a Saturday!

We had attempted to go to dinner at another little place a few blocks away, but were put off and decided to explore. Lucky we did cause I absolutely loved this place. We sat outside and it was very enchanting! I forgot we were in Phoenix for a while, which is a good thing. Phx needs more places like this! Our pizza was good, but I would have preferred a little more spice. Our crepe was delicious! I would go back for that alone! Overall, we had a great experience and hope to get back there before the summer hits us so we can enjoy the quaint patio experience:)

My wife and I stopped by here not too long ago and wanted someplace with a good ambiance to chat and read...we found it! This place was absolutely fantastic! My chai latte was great and her triple chocolate was absolutely delicious. There were only a few other people there and we enjoyed the calm! Will definitely be going back!

Bountiful Baskets is absolutely amazing. My wife and I are vegetarians and picking up a basket each week can pretty much last us the week. If we ever skip on getting a basket we end up spending so much money on groceries! Every once in a while we get something that is about to go bad etc, but most of the time it is wonderful. By not knowing what we are getting each week, we have to be creative and inventive with our recipes and I absolutely love that! If you aren't getting a bountiful basket, then you are missing out!

I was excited to find a sushi place near our home in Glendale, but the excitement faded as soon as I walked in to the place. It has a very cheap feel to it. Fake plants everywhere, bad lighting, you get the point. We sat and ordered a few different rolls...none of which were good. The fish was not very fresh and the presentation was lacking.  If you are really craving sushi and there is nothing else, this will do-but don't get your hopes up!

Awesome decor. Not what I expected at all! Very roomy and had wonderful vibes. The girl at the counter was really nice and recommended some drinks to us that were absolutely delish! I had the Caramel drink and I slurped it down! We decided to sit outside since the weather was so nice and I loved the whole environment. We will definitely go back!

I absolutely loved this place! We went with a friend a few days ago and sat out on the patio. The weather was absolutely gorgeous! I used the restroom once and peeked in and loved the inside as well. I would totally do a dinner here in the future. We ordered our meals and they were divine! I loved my sandwich and our desert was good too. The music was great, the ambiance was chill--all around wonderful place to eat lunch!

My wife and I were looking for just a simple cafe to stop by and have a quick sandwich or something at last night when we came upon this gem. We recently bought a house in Glendale, and good restaurants are in high need! When we walked in we could tell this was not a "cafe"-but it so so unique we decided to stay and eat anyway! Our server was super sweet and explained everything on the menu for us (my wife is a vegetarian). We ordered the 4 cheese crepe, a cheese fondue, and the chocolate fondue dessert and all three were absolutely divine. What I really appreciated from our server was that when we asked about serving size she told us how much we could realistically eat rather than just letting us order blindly. That is good service! The food was wonderful, but if you go to this place for nothing more than the decor you should be happy! This place made me glad I live in Glendale!

My wife and I went at about 5:10 not knowing that they only served dinner after 6. Rather than asking us if we wanted Happy Hour drinks I almost felt like they were trying to get us to leave. They informed us that dinner was not til 6 and gave us a menu of their happy hour appetizers, which didn't look too appealing compared to the dinner entrees we wanted to eat later on. As we left a woman said, "we don't have fire right now." I don't think I know entirely what she meant, but we let them know we would try another time and headed over to Lola's coffee and then ate and Cibo. I liked the look of the place, but it was very unwelcoming...
