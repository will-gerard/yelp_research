These people make me sick. They hold my direct deposit payroll checks for up to 14 days!!!! I set up my bills to auto-deduct when my check will be deposited. Said I wanted NO overdraft protection. They hold my check, bills get paid and bam I'm hit with $300 in overdraft fees? Are you serious? My money disappears, has not shown in my account for days, shows (-) balance when I know I have money, go down to talk to them and they said, looks good on our side you must have read it wrong. I know how to read a statement you ignoramous. Way to make your customers uncomfortable, awkward and angry. Everyone in there is rude, looks down on you and so incredibly unhelpful. I heard great things about them, and never in my life have I had a worse experience. I have banked with Chase, Wells Fargo, TruWest, BOA and desert schools. Never again would I put anyone in their hands. Unless you don't want access to your money, people to look at you like you are garbage, not respond to phone calls or e-mails, and hold your check so they can charge you insane amount in overdraft fees because they won't release your own money to you.

Beautiful, friendly and covered in pink. Pink Uniforms, pink walls, spa and medical area as well. I went to the Chandler location, they have a paging system, huge waiting room, kids play area. Great staff. Apple computers you can play with once in the room. Been three times in the last month and never waited for than 7 minutes. First gyno I have been very happy with and will stay looooong term. Had an emergency 2 weeks after my first appointment, explained my symptoms, they told me to come down immediately and I was seen by my own dr. within 10 minutes from my call. If you need an ultrasound they are usually booked about 3-4 weeks in advance so plan ahead.

I have to update my review. I have been here 6 months and my complaint is with the CONSTANT up selling. Buy these $76 worth of vitamins because nothing else on the face of the planet will work, pay for this testing at $100 plus this equipment you need for $75 but next time it's only $99!! Buy this watch that is vital to your survival only $249! Which you can find on amazon for $100 less. Let me work out and stop selling me crap! Took my boyfriend and his son to the pool, was told I brought my bf 5 months earlier and he couldn't come in more than one time in a 6 month period. My "rules" didn't allow it. No one ever explained that before. I asked what membership I needed to get him in so I could change it and she said she didn't know, just not mine. I asked for a 2 week pass for him to try the gym and was told no. Been trying to get him to join but after that fiasco he would rather spend the $10 a month at planet fitness with no pressure, no up selling and no snooty teenagers denying him access. I get the terms but they were never explained, were not clarified and we felt like criminals coming in to enjoy the pool with our kids. That left a horrible taste in his mouth and he hates the gym now. I like it but not sure it's worth it anymore. I'm on my third trainer who is good but again I feel like I'm always being told to buy stuff. Now paying $250 a month for training, $75 for my monthly membership and, just had to buy a $150 heart rate monitor an the $100 AMA testing which again is vital to my survival Apparantly. We will see. Sad I had to take away a star though. And ps $3 for a 1 liter of vitamin water is too much :(   I'm not even sure where to begin with this place. I literally spent 7 months deciding if I wanted to join or not. I was too intimidated to go in the gym and check it out but I was fed up with my body and I really dislike Gold's gym so I e-mailed them for the 5th time, said screw it and signed up on-line. So the first time I went in I was green and had no idea what to do. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly, took me on a tour of the whole place, set me up with guest passes that I asked for and gave me free lunch.   The gist of it is, I pay $75 a month for myself and my 5 year old. This covers 2 hours of childcare 7 days a week if I want it. For $10 a month that's MORE than worth it. Their kid's center has a TV, infant area, inside gym, computer center, toys galore outside play area and is always more than amply staffed. They also have events included in your membership like rock climbing wall, kids gym, and yoga. You can also sign up for "parent's night out" for 4 hours its $15 and your kid plays, gets pizza and other stuff (not sure on details I haven't done it yet)  Moving on, I signed up and had $200 LT bucks. I took my HealthScore and met with Corey Goldstein who has been absolutely PHENOMENAL. He didn't laugh when I told him my goal and I paid for a session with him with my LT bucks and he kicked my weak little but in shape. He is phenomenal. He is the manager though so he can't train people. I was somehow talked into doing training ($69-$75 an hour) but I'm a broke ass and only signed up for 2/month. I was originally set up with someone and it wasn't working for me so I was immediately switched to someone else who has been phenomenal! I train with Jacob now and he created a weekly plan for me too when we don't train together.   Some of the amenities:  basketball court awesome lockers showers scented steam room indoor and outdoor pools, kiddie splash area, designated family time. hot tubs salon (never used it)  yoga pilates weekly classes (tons) weight management programs (extra cost) metabolic testing cafe rock climbing wall squash courts tennis courts nutrition counseling newsletter great website with lots of free resources running training  lots more I can't remember. Anyway I love it! I couldn't be happier.

The best in Tempe. Cheap pitchers, good outside location, parking is usually a little hard though.

Horrible! Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw. Literally RAW. Won't even go on about it. Ruined appledbees for me forever. Stay AWAY!

I can't even begin to describe the horrific experience I just had trying to enroll my 5 year old in their summer camp. I spent 40 minutes registering, filling out paperwork, trying to get my questions answered and being thrown around and around and around. I waited in line 5 times, was never acknowledged until I begged someone at the desk to help me, couldn't get any of my questions about swim lessons during camp answered, "uh...just pick one." but you have one during camp, so which one is it, um...it's whatever one you want it to be. NO IT ISN'T!!!! don't pretend to know the answer if you are going to make up some bs.   Paperwork says you pay a $25 deposit for each week which is already pretty steep. What the paperwork doesn't say is that you pay a $35 registration fee, a $15 shirt fee, $25 for each week AND 4 weeks upfront. um...what? so I'm ready to pay my deposits and everything and the girls says, okay your total is $770!! what?!!! My kid is a foster kid, I'm a single mom are you kidding me? $770 for the sign up fee? WTF?   I asked the girl to show me where it says that on the paperwork, she said, oh it doesn't the camp director just decided that's what you will pay. she just decided? how the eff do people afford that? I said, seriously? she goes, I know, right? so...  so what? you people are dumb. What kind of ignoramus do you have working the front desk? I asked when school started so I knew how long I wanted to keep her in camp, the girl said, "I'm not in school, so I don't know." you are running summer camp registration, you better know when school starts. Well since you couldn't answer a single one of my questions, why should I expect you to know that?   I finally fork over the money to get away from her and ask where to go, she says "the gym." are you kidding me? it's the ymca, the entire place is a gym?!!!!!!!!!!!! I walk down 1/2 mile of hallway with 20 rooms, and I see no kids anywhere.   I have to go back to the front again. wait in line. AGAIN. the guy hustles me up and said go back to the gym. I said, "look, we have never been here we don't know where we are going, can you please just help us?" He said, end of the hall.   Thanks jerk.  YMCA I'm calling you now to cancel this bs membership. I hate you and you have ruined my opinions of YMCA everywhere.

No good. Ghetto people live here and just walk into your apartment. Tons of brat kids in the parking lot that run at your car, neighbors suck, new RIVERSTONE management sucks, shootings happened 3 times that I lived there in 9 months. Alliance maintenance was great and right on the golf course was beautiful. Layout on 2 bedroom also nice but Too many other problems. Crappy carpet, upgrades are poorly done and hair was painted into the walls throughout. Can hear everything around you all the time and parking sucks for guests.

I come from Santa Barbara, home of the original Habit and this is jut as good. So excited to have it close to me. They have taken to stopping by the tables to ask if you need drink refills and opening doors. Friendly faces top quality food. Where I chose To go for my birthday. Love it!

I dislike the dentist, who doesn't? This wasn't like another dentist though, they gave me a tour to put me at ease, showed me pricing before I did anything, were very low pressure, gave me goody bags and even had a comfort menu. Ie free water, chapstick, blanket or even and ipad to play on if you are bored. I have three more appointments scheduled already and I have already referred my mom and 2 friends. Thanks guys!

Lived in many many apartments and this is by far my favorite. It's a townhome so not really an apartment but it's incredible.   It's large, stunningly beautiful. Don't let the nay sayer below deter you. Yes you can hear plumbing, so what? It's just water noises like you get anywhere else.   The flooring is beautiful and I love to use my fireplace. The amenities and grounds are beautiful  and the office staff is always willing to help and is very friendly.   The CARES team does a fantastic job creating several resident events per month that are family, kid and even adult friendly to give you a little break from the kiddos from time to time.   The fitness center was recently upgraded, the pools are awesome as is the theater! (yeah a theater). I don't hear my neighbors ever and there is always guest parking.   If I ever leave it will only be on-site to a 3 bedroom. Thanks Verano! Keep it up!
