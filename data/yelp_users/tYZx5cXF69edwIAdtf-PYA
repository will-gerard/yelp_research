Geoff Caldwell and his staff were expedient, friendly, fair priced, and knowledgeable! My taxes were quiet complicated this year but it was no obstacle for there CPAs who completed my return in 2 business days. Despite the complexity of my taxes, I was charged less than I ever have in previous years for simple returns. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a CPA. I have finally found a CPA that I can stick with.

I had a positive experience at the Scottsdale location.  I was in the market for a new dentist due to an insurance change at work.  I was having severe sensitivity in one of my molars and was expecting to need a root canal.  I was correct. I am one of those patients who has a million and one questions about my care and treatment.  The dentist was patient and thorough in answering all my questions and concerns.  I felt very assured completing the root canal phases. The entire root canal should have been completed in three office visits however mine took five office visits which was frustrating due to having to take at least an hour off work for each appointment.    Overall, I am very satisfied. I was always called back within 5 minutes of my appointment time, the dental assistants and the receptionist are friendly, and the office is clean. I will return for my future cleaning and dentistry needs.

Cute pub and Atmosphere but slow service. My friends and I went in at lunchtime on a Saturday and it took about 30 minutes before our order for appitizers was taken and it took our entrees 20 minutes to come out after our order was placed placed. The restaurant was only a fourth of the way full so I'm not sure what was taking so long. I'll have to give this place another try another day. Maybe today was just not a great day for them.

I have used Safelite to repair or replace my windshield multiple times over the last 5 years. All my experiences have been mostly positive. Today they came out to my home to replace the windshield on my car and did not arrive within the window they gave me. They give a rather large window for their arrival which I find frustrating. I have once driven to their office since their office is near my work place to have my windshield replaced and on that day the wait was much longer than they had estimated. They said they would be able to repair the crack in my windshield within 30 minutes of me arriving and the actual service time would be another 30. I ended up being there for a couple of hours. A job that should have been completed during my lunch hour, as they projected, caused me to have to take time off work. Their front office area is small. Overall their technicians are friendly and they do a great job. I will use them again in the future.

I stop in at this location a couple times a month as I work nearby.  I have never gone inside but the drive through is always speedy.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  My order is always accurate.  No complaints.

Excellent customer service and knowledgeable staff!  I visited YES for the first time yesterday in need of good quality human hair extensions. The staff member who helped me was patient and answered my many questions I had about the differences in the hair they carry. She gave me advice on caring for the hair and helped educate me about the multiple brands and types of hair.   I felt confident in deciding to purchase a pack of weft extensions that I will later add clips to for clip-in extensions. They have a range of prices of hair to choose from. I decided on a more expensive pack as often times you get what you pay for. I would recommend this hair supply store to anyone looking for quality hair supplies and friendly service.

Customer Service Non Existent! I walked into the shop and did not get a single greeting from the three associates. I looked around at the extensions and clip ins for 10 minutes and was not offered any help at all. Save your time and go to a different store for your extension need. Headed elsewhere.

I was very disenchanted and frustrated with the conflicting information I was receiving from two customer representatives in this Sprint store.    I came in due to needing a repair on my phone. I had shattered the screen on my Samsung s5. I had the misfortune of being matched with Daniella due to my place in the Queue. She told me that the Sprint store did not repair cell phone screens and that I would have to file a claim through Assuron and pay my deductible for a new phone.  I was not thrilled and asked why it is that the repair store will not replace screens.  She repeated herself verbatim and I informed her that she did not answer my question.  She then answered that she did not know why... I asked her who would know and she said the repair tech should know why but she was busy with another customer. No problem.  We continued on, I asked about the current plan they have running to see if there is anything cheaper than what I already pay.  I have been on the same plan for about 5 years.  My old plan was grandfathered in and is no longer being offered.  After discussing with Daniella all the plans available and being told sprint no longer offered the Samsung s5 as part of their plans, I quickly determined I was not interested in any of them because it would actually cost me more than I was already paying.  I elected to activate another Samsung s5 which I purchased on eBay. While going through the activation process I overheard another rep tell another customer that the Samsung s5 is available. I called him over, Jacob, when he was finished and he explained that the s5 is still available but they did not have it in that particular store.  I would have to go to another store if I wanted to stick with my current model phone. At that moment, Daniella lost all her credibility.    I asked Jacob about any plans that were available to me as a current sprint customer without a need for a new phone.  The idea of leasing a phone is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Jacob explained to me that there was a $40 a month plan that allowed me unlimited data, text, and talk.  Now you're talking.  I wish this was explained to me 30 minutes ago while I was being explained misinformation from Daniella. I asked if there was a brochure detailing the plan and I was told no. I asked where I can find details of the plan and I was told online.  I asked if they could show me on their computer and they said they could not but I can look on my phone. I had to search for this plan on my phone on my tiny screen.  I found a similar plan to what was described however there was a disclaimer stating "activation of a new line or purchase of a new phone required".  I showed this to Jacob and explained again that I do not wish to purchase a new phone. He recognized the disclaimer and assured me that I can receive that same monthly price. Jacob appeared to become more and more exasperated when I explained I would like to see it in writing somewhere and that I was suspect and this "secret" plan that was not advertised anywhere.  Forgive me for believing only half of what I am told when it comes to quoting  contracts... I was worried about getting roped into a plan that I do not want. He simply replied "its not written anywhere, I am telling you. You will see it in the detail of the plan agreement". I reminded him again that I do not want to enter into a new contract.  He explained that this plan was not a contract.   I decided to move forward with this no contract unwritten plan and read the details carefully.  Jacob and Daniella appeared to grow more and more inpatient as I read every line of the document. Am I the only one who actually reads an entire document before signing???   I was disappointed in the service I received because the first rep I was helped by did not know much about anything, gave me misinformation, and pretended she did not hear the questions I was asking. I had to state to her that what I said was a question, prompting her to respond, before she would answer. Additionally she did not know where to find the sim card on my device and I ended finding it for her to relocate to the new phone.  Without the sim card the phone would have been inoperable.  Her name tag said she was "in training" perhaps she was not ready to be out on the floor by herself yet. Jacob at the very least seemed to be much more knowledgeable but had a low threshold for his frustration when I had questions. Questions which were legitimate although there were many.  In a customer service job he should be able to maintain his cool.    The only reason I am rating a 1 is because of Jacob's knowledge. Daniella would have earned a 0 if that rating was an option.  My next bill will tell if this plan is legitimate. If not I will be one the phone with corporate complaining.

Once again another terrible experience at this Sprint store.   This is the second time in a week that I have been to the Sprint store after experiencing microphone difficulties. My friends have been telling me that they cannot hear me when I'm talking to them on the phone. During my first visit about 5 days ago they explained that my microphone was just dirty so they cleaned the microphone. My phone was still having the same problem so I came back today. They made a call to their self on the phone and explain "it's working just fine". I explained well that's not what my friends are reporting, why would I be back here again if the problem was resolved? I don't understand what the problem is? I pay $11 a month for Total Protection why don't you just replace my microphone. I'm telling you that no one can hear me on my phone and I've been paying for insurance for seven years. I'm not understanding what the problem is. Every time I come to this store I seem to have a bad experience. Stay away and find another Sprint repair location. Perhaps you'll receive better service there.  I would greatly appreciate a call or response from the store manager!

Deplorable, is how I describe my experience at the Breakfast Club.  A friend and I dropped in after a hike on Camelback Mountain. We arrived at 2:40pm. We were aware that the restaurant would be closing at 3pm and already knew what we wanted to order. We were waiting at the front for a hostess and were not greeted for 3 minutes.  There was no one at the front. When the phone began ringing I was sure someone would come to the frnt but no one did!  In fact, three waitresses made eye contact with us then ignored us.  Finally, the bartender hollered over that we can sit anywhere we like and to seat ourselves.  We chose a table outside due to having a dog with us.  When our waitress arrived she was contemptuous.    We ordered our food immediately after the waitress brought us water.  We also asked for a couple cups of coffee.  Before our food came out, our waitress came back to our table and informed us "by the way they poured out the last pot of coffee so there is no more coffee". We were perplexed that she wouldn't just brew another pot if we wanted another cup, which we did. When our food finally arrived half of the food was hot and the other was cold.  My potatoes were hot and appeared to have come right off the stove however my eggs were cold.  How was it possible that my eggs were just made but became cold so quickly? We asked for a manager to explain what I have written above. The manager was very nice and apologetic and offered to remake our plates.   After receiving our remade plates, we noticed the waitress's and busser began closing up shop. While we were still eating, our waitress asked if she could take any plates away and if we needed our sugar packets any longer... Our plates weren't even half eaten. I was so appalled that she was trying to take away anything she could from our table that I considered asking her if she "needed to collect our silverware to put in the dishwasher leaving us to use our hands?" We paused before we replied that we were not done with the sugar. Soon after the bus boy began turning off the space heaters, including the one at our table. We had to finish our food in the cold. I was quickly beginning to feel like a second class citizen. There were a couple of parties still finishing up their food inside when the waitresses were placing the chairs on top of the tables in preparation for closing. I'm sure particles of dust and dirt were swept into the air and landing on their food. At the very least, I was comforted that we weren't the only ones receiving bad service, as weird as that sounds.    In the end, the manager comped our meal and we left most of it on our plate after being freezed out and our waitress chomping at the bit to take our plates away. Her behavior was more clamorous than our dog who was hoping we would drop crumbs that she could gobble. Needless to say, our experience was regrettable. We expected very different from a restaurant in Old Town with a modern open feel and large bar.  I frequently see lines out the door for the restaurant and it looked like a happening place. My advice is if you are going to dine here be sure you will be finished with all your food before 2:40pm otherwise your service will quickly dissolve.  I'm still wandering if they gave me eggs off of someone else's plate which would explain why they were cold. If the Breakfast Club does not want to serve until 3pm as their hours state they should close their kitchen earlier or close the restaurant earlier.  They certainly should not have asked us to have a seat and treat us as if it was an imposition.

Well done. I came in with crippling stomach pain at about 2:30 in the morning. I was called back so quickly I didn't have the opportunity to finish my paperwork. The doctor was immediately ready to see me and assess me. I spent about two and a half hours there and felt like I was in good hands. I felt much better when I left. What made the greatest impact on me was how quickly I was able to be seen. I was dreading having to be waiting in pain in the lobby. I will definitely be coming back to this emergency room but hopefully I will never need to.

Terrible. It seems every time I come to this location I have a negative experience. The first time I came I purchased a computer office desk and an office chair. My items had to be order because I wanted a color  that was not in store. When I arrived to pick up my packagees one of the store associate who helped me was running around like a chicken with its head cut off because he could not locate my package. I was beginning to think that someone else had picked it up. They just leave them up front where anybody could walk by and grab the package. The associated was finally able to locate my package after 30 minutes of looking all over the store.   Today when I went in I needed to print off just a few pages from my flashdrive. The guy in the print center is nearly useless and his tone is rude. He tried to open the files from my flashdrive and we quickly realized that we would not be able to open the files because my drive is password protected. Instead of ejecting the thumb drive like I had instructed him urgently 3 times, he just ripped it out of the computer and says "there's no eject button". I educated him that there is not a button it's a function, you right click and eject flashdrives so that you don't corrupt or damage the files. Clearly staples needs to properly train their employees. This guy doesn't have basic computer knowledge. I'm hoping when I get home all of my files are not ruined. I will not be back to this location!

I stopped in for a quick iced coffee. The staff was courteous, friendly, and prompt. My coffee order was completed in less than a couple minutes and I was on my way.  The barrage was very tasty however there was an accumulation of sugar at the bottom of the cup that would not dissolve into the drink.  I would come back by this location when I'm in the area.

Dissapointed, I recently switched to Walgreens pharmacy when my pharmacy was bought out by another company. I was very sick one weekend and had my prescriptions sent here since it's literally about a half a mile away from my home. I went to the drive-thru with my script in order to just be in and out of there. The lady who helped me said it would be about 45 minutes to fill the order. Instead of driving home I decided to wait in my car. I was feeling terrible.   After an hour of not receiving a call or text that my prescriptions were ready, I decided to go inside. To my surprise when I stepped up to the counter the same lady quickly began gathering my medications, entering them into the system, and preparing my order. This made me wonder what she'd been doing for the last hour. I was not happy with the wait time that I was given because I do believe they could have prepared my medication right away. Isn't that the whole point of having a drive-thru ? Hopefully my next experience will be better.

I have been a patient at this office for the past 1.5 years. Shari and Gail go above and beyond to meet my needs each time I have called for an appointment I was able to get in within the week, twice I had a next day appointment. I was always called back into the office within minutes of arriving, I've never felt rushed out the door, while discussing my concerns, and all the staff remember me by name.  I recommend this office to anyone looking for a primary care physician or if you simply have a cold.

I enjoyed myself when I dined at Olive and Ivy for the first time this past weekend.  The food was good as well as the service. They have many wines to choose from if that is your thing. My only compliant is that I was told on the phone that reservations were not needed so when I arrived there was only seating in the marketplace area of the restaurant.  I believe this took away from my entire experience.  Next time, I will be sure to make a reservation in order to secure better seating.

I was very dissatisfied with this Fry's location.   Typically I love Frys and I can find everything I need. However today I found that this Frys was very old and could use some renovation. Additionally, when I was trying to use the self checkout station I ran into so many problems. The bagging station was not recognizing that I was putting my items in the bag so the cashier would have to come by and confirm that I was bagging all the items that I was ringing on multiple occasions, also it would not recognize my Fry's VIP card. The chasier had to scan my card. Not a good experience at all. From now on I will be going to a different location.   The only reason why I came to this location is because it was conveniently located to the gym where I work out at I was starving after a strenuous workout.

I just left the sears outlet store empy handed. The salesmen in the store were more concerned with joking around with each other than helping me find a washer, dryer, and refrigerator. I was finally greeted and asked if I needed help after looking at every washer and dryer in the place. At that point, I did not want to purchase from the store and give any of them commission. The customer service is none existant.

Clean and organized store. I hadn't been to to Bashas in a while and I found that this one is certainly the best I've visited. Their sales ad discounts lured me in. Definitely worth the trip with the savings I found. I'll be back in the near future.

Cute little shop. Pretty big selection of cupcakes. There is also a vending machine that can be accessed from the outside of the shop. This means at any time of the day you can order a variety of cupcakes at the touch of a button. I ordered the red velvet cupcake. I was disappointed because the cupcake did not taste much like red velvet its was essentially a red chocolate cupcake. I am a red velvet connoisseur so it is very difficult for me to find one that tastes as it should. However, I would definitely visit again.

I regret having to report the terrible service I received at this Target. I love Target and have always received superior service with the exception of tonight. While checking out tonight is seem that everyone else in the Target store was also checking out. The cashier who was working my lane , Ali,  had a 10 minute conversation with a fellow ASU student instead of tending to the line. At least 3 customers behind me got out of the line and went other lanes. I stayed in the line despite my frustration. I was quickly beginning to feel that I was at Walmart. I will be doing my shopping at other target locations where their staff members are more courteous.

I went into Ulta today to exchange a compact makeup that I purchase which was off in color. The sales person who was helping me with the exchange could not answer the questions I was asking her so she ignored me. She also left her register to help another cashier and customer while she was in the middle of ringing me up. This location's employees lack customer service. However, I do love Ulta's products.

I find myself bringing my family and friends who are visiting from out of town here for a meal. Their food is good, atmosphere inviting, and their drinks tasty. Each time I have dined here the restaurant manager has stopped by my table to ask how we are doing . You may also find him helping deliver plates. I always enjoy myself and will definitely be back. DD is typically busy on Sunday Funday for brunch, a testament to the restaurant's popularity.

My experience was regrettable. My friends and I decided to take part in their buffet for the all you can eat crab legs. While we were waiting to be seated, almost 5 minutes after we paid, we overheard one of the hostesses say seat them in the back with all the "bad" people. Everyone in my group were African American. I can only imagine why she concluded we were "bad". We are all in our late twenties and had just gotten off work and we're still in our business clothes. As you can understand, we quickly lost our appetites. We decided not to let one person's ignorance ruin our night so we stayed to dine.   The food was average, the service was subpar, and the desserts were underwhelming. I will not be back there to eat ever again. Unless you're in the mood to be insulted and treated poorly I wouldn't recommend that you go either.

I came in to purchase a computer desk as well as a desk chair. Asside from being greeted by the cashier I recieved no assistance. A clerk who appeared to be the general manager sat down at one of the desks in the middle of the show room area where I was shopping for over 15 minutes and never greeted me nor asked me if I had a question. Many of the desk chairs did not have a price tag. Due to the lack of customer service I decided not to purchase from this store. This location did have a wide selection of office furniture.

I had a blast kayaking the lake with a friend this past weekend.  The weather was great, the staff was friendly, and the rental prices were reasonable.  I will definitely be back this summer to check out the stand up paddle boarding. My recommendation to othersis to wear "beach attire" as you will probably get wet from all activities with the exception of paddle boating and pontoon.

Each time that I have gone I have arrived in the evening and have not had to wait longer than about 5 minutes before I was called to the seat. I'm very happy with how my haircut turned out my hair looks refreshed and healthy. I will definitely be back.

I wondered into the store by mistake. I was looking for a second hand home fitness equipment store but instead ended up here. I met Byron who assisted me and explained the gyms that they had for sale. They have great equipment for you to get your fitness game on. He was such a great salesman who took his time to explain things to me that I almost purchased a home gym on that visit. However, I had not prepared to drop almost three grand that day so I had to decline. If you're looking for excellent quality gym equipment which is commercial grade this is the place to go. Their equipment looks just like what you would find in large box gyms. They would probably last you a lifetime. I do have to warn you that they are big ticket items.

I ate at the chop shop for the first time yesterday. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a restaurant that offers so many clean eating options. I was able to order something straight off the menu that was paleo compliant and with no added sugars. They even have lemonade made without sugar. They use stevia as a substitute. This is a great restaurant for those who are health conscious but aren't quite in the mood to make dinner. I will definitely be back.

I attended an Orangetheory Fitness class for the first time this evening. A new gym is opening near me in Old Town Scottsdale so I decided to take the plunge. I was very impressed with the knowledge the staff had about the benefits of different workout techniques and their knowledge of the company's history.    The center is clean and organized, the staff is friendly, and the personal trainers are encouraging without being drill sergeants. I found it to be very motivating to see my heart rate displayed on the screen, knowing when I was in the "orange zone", and having my total calorie burn calculated. My workout was challenging in a great way. I sweated more than I ever have during my workouts at my regular gym. The workouts can be modified for people of all different fitness levels. You are really competing against yourself and will get out what you put in. Even the members were friendly.   I can see how the members become sort of a family when you regularly workout with the same group of people. The best part is knowing I will have access to the equipment during my workout unlike traditional gyms which are sometimes overcrowded. I'm excited to see how I feel in the morning and will definitely be back for more. If you're ready to get back in shape on a great workout plan, come join me. I recommend Orangetheory Fitness to everyone.

I am here for the "50 shades of men" show and I had a question for the personnel working the door. I approach a woman with a security shirt to ask her a question and immediately she pointed in my face for me to go to the end of the line without hearing my question. I was very offended that she didn't bother to hear my question which was pertaining to the cost of the show and if there was a different line for people with a groupon. I overheard that the woman's name was Dianne. Very very rude. This interaction represents the entire establishment.  The cashier also called my friend a "dumb dumb". I will not ever return nor would I recommend this place to a friend.

This coffee shop is quickly becoming my favorite hangout. I've been here more than a few time and have always had a great experience. The staff is pleasant, every time I've visit there has been live music, and there is indoor and outdoor seating. In one visit I once hung out for over 4 hours. Additionally, if you enjoy beer they serve ot here as well. The sip is great hang out any time of day.

I have no complaints. I love the concept of this restaurant. Ordering was easy, there are many toppings to from, and the food is fresh.  Definitely the best sub sandwich I have had in years. I plan on bringing friends and family to eat here in the future when we are exploring Mill Avenue "Downtown Tempe".

I enjoyed myself very much. My sister was visiting in town and we wanted to go to a relaxed atmosphere that served good drinks. We found our place. It was a Friday afternoon we had a couple of margaritas as well as fajitas and fish tacos. Delicious. Our waitress was friendly. It was a cool day. Salty's has a spacious patio on the front and the back. Lots of opportunities to people watch.

I decided to give Royal Car Care a try after seeing an awesome deal for a package of oil changes on Groupon. I arrived and the garage and  waiting room was clean.  There is complimentary coffee and water available.  The owners, a husband and wife, were very pleasant, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Right away they begin working on my oil change at the time of my appointment.  This may sound normal but it has not been my experience at other garages. I was in and out in 45 minutes.  Quickest oil change I have ever had even compared to those drive through garages. They informed me about a recalled part on my vehicle and directed me to take my car back to the dealer for a free repair.  No up sale attempts! Another first for me and I am a woman. I'm so glad I have found a place I can have an oil change completed on my lunch break.  I would recommend this garage to my friends and family.  Well done.

I'm still completing all my car maintenance at Royal Car Care. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I anticipate they will get even more efficient now that they have a larger garage with more parking at 4931 E McDowell Rd, Phoenix, AZ. The new location is right off the freeway east of the 143. Very convenient to zip in and zip out back to work.   I hear they are looking forward to having a food truck in their parking lot for all us busy people who get our oil changes on our lunch break. One stop shopping. A+

Extremely Satisfied!    I came to Advantage Beauty to participate in the HCG weight loss program. Advantage Beauty offers medical grade HCG that you take by injection and an accompanying eating plan which consists of low carb, low calorie diet (LCD).  I have had great success in losing weight while on their program.  I have tried many different diets and exercised plans and have only lost about 5 lbs no matter how much I exercised and was compliant with the eating plan.  I lost 10 lbs in my first week working with Advantage Beauty.  The first few days is when I saw the greatest losses. After that, I lost at least a half a pound a day, usually 1 lb. I have about 30 lbs to lose.    Mid program, I accidentally dropped my vial of HCG on the counter and spilled the medication. I was without my injections for 4 days. I continued to adhere to the LCD even though I was not taking the injections and I did not see any weight loss.  This is a testament to the efficacy of HCG.  I continued to eat and exercise the same and saw no changes on the scale. After the holiday weekend  I went to the spa first thing in the morning to replace my broken vial of HCG. I am now storing my vial in a small tupperware container stuffed with a paper towl to avoid another mishap.    My HCG is in good hands and so am I at Advantage Beauty.  I would recommend Advantage Beauty and their HCG weight loss plan to anyone trying to lose weight. Whether you have a lot to lose or a little you will have great success. The office is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and Lynette Lange truly cares about helping you achieve your goals.

Great mimosa special for women on Sunday for brunch. Unique menu options. Great atmospher and better service. My only compliant was that the restaurant was a bit warm. Could be becuase it was so hot outside but they should figure out how to cool the place down to a more comfortable temperature. I'll be back when the weather cools down.

I visited a second time in the evening and had a great time. The misters were on and it was quiet comfortable. This is a very happening place in the evenings.  I can see my self meeting up with friends here regularly.

I attended a yoga class here this morning. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience. The instructor was very knowledgeable and interactive. The the class was challenging but not too difficult for a beginner, I even worked up a sweat. This studio offers massages, salon services, and a juice bar is coming soon. I will definitely be back and will be recommending the studio to friends.

This Starbucks location is decent sized. Plenty of seating. They have a laptop bar that can probably seat about 8 people. I enjoy hanging, having a slice of pumpkin bread, and catching up on my email on their free wifi network. I would recommend this location to everyne. The parking lot is large,  the restaurant is clean,  and there is a drive-thru at this location.

My friends and I attended the grand opening last night after receiving a few VIP invites.  We had a great time.  The appetizers were delicious, the drinks were tasty, and the staff was friendly. There is plenty of room to sit and relax with your friends much like you would in your back yard (if your backyard had wait staff and bartenders). Also, there were many tables if you'd prefer to sit down and have a meal. There were plenty of games to play and televisions if you're into watching a game. I would recommend The Yard to anyone looking to have a fun night out with good food and attractive people, all while avoiding  having to stand for hours and being overcrowded.

I visited Dakota on a Saturday night and had good time dancing with friends. The place was very roomy, the dance floor is a decent size, the bouncers and bartenders were friendly, and the music was great. I will definitely be back in the near future. My only con is that there are not many placed to sit. Unless you reserve a table, it appears the patio Is the only place to sit.

I came back to Dakota for Brunch with a friend.  This was the first time I have visited during the day.  Our waitress did not know anything about the entrees and pretended she didn't hear us when we asked if the music could be turned down.  She was terrible. My food was overcooked, almost to the point that I could not eat it. I left half of it on the plate.  The music is pretty load here even at 11am. For some reason the DJ decided to turn the music up about 10 minutes  after we arrived otherwise we could have eaten someplace that is quite.  I wouldn't have minded it so much if my friend and I weren't trying to catch up and wanted to hear what each other were saying.    Hopefully my next visit will be better.

Absolutely great workout. I left today knowing I got the work out of my life. You know that feeling you get after a challenging workout when every muscle in your body is shaky and you feel like you want to lie down on the ground, or maybe make a protein smoothie, or have a protein smoothie while laying down. That's how I felt after this workout.   I always know I'm going to get a great workout when I go to orangetheory fitness. Their 60 minute classes are directed by certified personal trainers who are postive and encouraging. I know I am doing much more in their class than I would be doing at the gym motivating myself. Everyone wears heart rate monitors so you can see whether or not you're in the fat burning "orange" zone. This is great encouragement not to slack off because if you do everybody will see you and you're pretty much wasting your time. I used to attend the Tempe location and I am ecstatic that the old town location has finally opened because it is just down the road from me.  Come join us it's a revolution.

Very Nice. I dined at Radish during thier grand opening this weekend. The marketplace in which they are housed was very modern and inviting.  I could see myself hangout out here with friends getting a bite to eat or enjoying some coffee and conversation. Radish offers salads, cold press juices, and hummus plates. I sampled all their juices and they were all great. My favorite was Kale Me Maybe, which was bottled and ready to go. I didnt have the opportunity to try one of the many salads however I did notice thier substantial size. They would definitely fill you up. I will be stopping by next time I'm in the area.

Nice little brewery walking distance from the Scottsdale nightlife area. This would be a great place to start off your night. They have a small section of beer which they brew onsite and a couple of wines. I enjoyed myself.

Mmmm. Yumm. Was driving home when I saw Fatty Daddy's sign for the first time. This ice cream shop has ice cream in at least 22 different flavors. There are multiple toppings for you to choose from which includes their famous Macaroon Cup. I sampled 3 different ice cream flavors, all of which were delicious. I decided on peanut butter on a sugar cone. I had been thinking to myself recently how it is unfortunate that there is not an ice cream shop in South Scottsdale and now there's one right in my neighborhood. I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. I wonder if I walk to get ice cream, will I burn all the calories that I will consume from the ice cream?   Anyhow if you are looking to try something new swing by. The staff is friendly, cute dining area, and outside seating. I understand they will be having a grand opening this Saturday on 2/6/16.

My visit was regretable. On 07/17/2016 at 9:00pm after waiting in a line of over 45 customers on a busy night for at least 30 minutes, myself and my two friends were just 3 people from the register. At that time the line was still all the way to the door. Some girl decided to cut the line and walk up to the register. The three girls in front of us stated to the MANAGER, whom had interduced himself to me on previous visits, who was working the register that the girl was cutiing the line. He just shrugged his shoulders. That's when I mentioned that the rest of us had been waiting for 30 minutes and she was cutting the line. He just shugged again. We told him he just lost three customers and begin to walk out. He literally waved us away like "bye" unconcerned. Deplorable.  Take your business elsewhere.  I will never be back.
