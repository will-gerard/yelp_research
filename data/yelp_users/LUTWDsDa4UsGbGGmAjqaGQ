There is outdoor patio furniture and there is All American Fine Outdoor Furnishings. I initially saw the furniture I wanted in an ad. I contacted the store to see if it was in stock and to discuss color options. I was given all the needed information on the phone and arrived at the store to find my pieces ready and waiting for me. I am in sales and often find myself extra critical of customer service but these guys rocked! Thanks for a great experience.

I was going to send my daughter to Wal-Mart to get her oil changed for $30.00 but then received a coupon in the mail for a Midas oil change for $19.99.  I sent her there instead.  My daughter is 16.  She returned home with a $35.50 oil change! I asked her how that happened and she said, "David" insisted that she needed the more expensive oil and that is all they offer now so she didn't really have a choice.  He also told her that they don't honor that coupon even thought their location is right on the coupon.  He tried to up sell her a bunch more crap but luckily she was smart enough to say no.  I called him when she returned home and asked him what kind of scam they are running and he said that they don't accept that coupon and the fact that their name and location is on the coupon is irrelevant.  He apparently gave her a $5.00 credit so this was a $40.00 plus oil change.  David is a crook and Midas practices false advertising and exploitation.    One more thing...when I questioned his lack of ethics and shabby business practices he hung up on me.  Typical coward.

Thankfully the new owner, Greg, has turned this place around.  After I posted a bad review due to the previous owners unethical work standards Greg reached out to me.  He assured me that things are different there and he was telling the truth.  Greg has worked very hard to make this an inviting environment and to be an ethical and honest business owner.  My daughter recently had a car issue so I took Greg up on his offer to stop by and say hello and be shown that this shop is being run the way it should be.  Greg got my daughter in right away and then called to tell me that there was actually nothing wrong with the car.  We are planning a return trip to get new tires put on her car.  Thanks, Greg!

I've had the privilege to meet and work with both Rich and Anne Brady.  They are funny, kind people with a high level of professionalism.  I recently retained Anne to represent me in a civil lawsuit.  She was down to earth, reasonable, and easily attainable.  There is nothing worse than hiring an attorney and never being able to get through to them.  Anne responds to emails in a reasonable time period, takes calls, and returns calls.  The best part is that Anne secured a victory for me along with a settlement.  Thanks, Anne!
