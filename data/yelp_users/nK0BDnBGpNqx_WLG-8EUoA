Pretty sure even if I wasn't  into eating food (roasted corn pizza is the most amazing pizza ever. Sorry Pizzaria  Bianca) I would come here just to hang out with Eric the bartender on the regular. Such a great time & provides awesome suggestions of things I would never try before. Chili Lime Tequila sour? Yes please! Love this little hidden bar on the southside of la grande orange. Love that u can just come into the bar without waiting in that long line & have a kick butt bartender at the same time. Come here if you want a good time or else go ahead with your lame existence!

Love this coffee. Love the little tiny crooked house it is is & the giant outside area you sip on your delicious coffee at. 2 brothers with a great thing going for them. Don't forget to grab a bag of roast coffee beans to go!

The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager did offer to re-do our burger & did come around & ask us how we were doing twice. So on that note... I ordered the loaded fries. Apparently loaded means no flavor bland cheese sauce & fries with some bacon sprinkled on top. Blah! Luckily I ordered ketchup on the side to go with my burger I was waiting for & used some on my "loaded fries". A little flavor goes a long way guys, even something as simple as salt. Next on to my burger. I ordered it medium. To me & the nice waitress taking my order medium meant nice pink middle. My burger was raw on the inside. Raw! The only thing cooked was the outside. Thankfully I shared it with my husband & only had to pay for one raw burger. It's a burger place, why is my burger raw?!?!! You have burger in your name. For a place that makes burgers the number one thing on their menu the burger should be cooked perfect every time. Just like If I went to a steakhouse. And again a bit of flavor goes a long way. Salt isn't a bad thing in moderation! So disappointed.

This place has it all. Great atmosphere, food, & drinks. Service was good. We went on Valentine's Day & i loved that in the bathroom they had Valentine cards & treats just incase you forgot someone. Very excited for one going up in Gilbert. Love the Bloody Mary options. Had the Bangkok & it was spot on! Chilaquiles Benedict where amazing & I'll be honest I was very nervous about this choice. Everyone else enjoyed their meals & they were very accommodating for my friend who doesn't do dairy. Sweet potato pancakes were a pleasant surprise. Def worth the wait, especially since Postinos is next door for a Bellini while you wait.
