We had my daughter's 8th birthday here today. What a great experience! We chose to go with the 4:30 to 7 time slot because of the special "cosmic skate" type session. Most of the girls attending had never skated before. When I booked the party I also reserved the skate mates - they are like walkers on wheels to help new skaters. The staff was excellent, especially our party host. I spent the same amount of money I would have at Chuck E Cheese and everyone - including adults - had a way better time. I will be doing this again for years to come!

When my family moved to Surprise 4 years ago I loved Macayo's! It was my favorite place to grab Mexican food in Surprise. Over the past 18 months it has really gone down. On my last visit the server told me she brought me what I ordered and I must have ordered wrong. What?!? Even if I did it would have been nice for the server to attempt to fix the problem.   I will continue to go to Macayo's with friends and sit in the bar for happy hour. As for a place to regularly go to meals with my family, not so much.

Lately their customer service has not been great. Today I was told that I had to add my own Splenda to my drink after they made it. I explained that I didn't like to put sweetener on top of the foam and they told me to do it myself anyway - they didn't want to "upset someone's coffee by not doing it right." It was just 2 Spelnda not a huge variation... I guess I am back to grabbing coffee at the grocery store locations.

Basha's is a great store if you shop with children. The best perk is the child care center. The ladies who work in it are very nice and great with my kids. Basha's is a bit overpriced and does not carry everything, but it is good when I need a few sane 'mommy moments' to shop in peace. To me, that is worth the extra $10 I will spend there. Plus the pizza is amazing and a fantastic price.

Rachael is the best hair dresser I have ever had, hands down! She does my hair, most of my friends' hair, and all of our kids. She is AMAZING! I have been seeing her for over 2 years now and would never consider going anywhere else. She has become family. :)
