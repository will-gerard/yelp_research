Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.

It's not Mexican, its Tex-Mex so as long as you realize that you're going to be ok. The salsa is awesome, the service is awesome and most of the food is awesome. We drive from the other side of town to go to this place. I have not had anything here I didn't like and most of the servers have all been great. Drinks are great too if you're looking for drinks.  They just redid the patio and it is super nice!

Walked in to buy flowers for my wife the day before mothers day. You would think they would be staffed to help people. Instead there was one other customer, my daughter and I walked around looked and no once did we get asked if we needed anything or if they could get us flowers. Apparently business is so great they don't need anymore business. I have bought from here before and service was over the top. I have never been more disappointed. I went to Albertson's and received service that was 1000% better than what I got here, plus the flowers were priced reasonable.

Terrible experience. Reservation at 3 they go ally got us in at 330. Even if your not eating you have to pay for a meal to sit with the rest of the party that is eating. Service awfully slow took 45 to get main meal and wait staff doesn't pay attention to guest. Ruined a thanksgiving dinner that's for sure. I would never come back here.

Love Venezia's we always go tot he one on Cooper, and the staff there knows us now which is a plus. They let my little girl stand at the counter and watch them work, and are always going the extra mile for great service.  The food is amazing, I am not going to say its 5 star dining but if you are looking for great slice of pie, or anything else they offer it is great. The wings are awesome too! Not to mention the combos they have here are truly awesome priced and they have a app for your phone to get rewards!   I would go here all the time if I could!

Reminds me of a small town cafe, loved it and will go back! The food was great, the service was great, and being able to watch the airfield was the topper. I only live a few miles from here and never knew about this place. Can't wait to go back!

Went here for Thanksgiving dinner. 18.95 for adults and 8.95 for kids. The adults and kids plates were exactly the same, the only difference was a small (and I do mean small) salad that the adults got. The food itself was good, not home cooking but hey you're not at home right? The steak was good as well. The service at dinner was all but not there. We had waitress who was too busy to actually answer questions and be a person, never checked on us for more than a second it was passing by so if you needed something good luck!  Atmosphere was cool. The characters that roam around and the other stuff outside the steakhouse were cool too. It was too muddy for some stuff to open since the rain storm hit a week ago and flooded the area but they made the best of it.  I would go back, but I don't think I would eat here. The prices for food like any other "amusement" area are crazy high but you're not far from the mall and cheaper food. Over all for no admission costs and tickets/wrist bands it was a great time. It would have been 4 or 5 stars if the service in the steak house was there.

It's the typical chain of Chili's however they have a server at lunch named Paige. If you go ask for her and tell her I sent you. She is be far the best server I have ever had and does such a great job! My co-worker and I go here just because of her, the food isn't anything out of the world it is good, but the service ranks this place above many others.  The lunch specials will fill you up as well! The soups are completely awesome!

Right before dinner and the food looks like it is from yesterday. To add insult to injury your workers are making jokes about how bad the food looks that they have to sell. Fresh is not in the vocabulary. Don't ask for fresh food either because they refuse to do that. Lousy workers did nothing but complain about how much they have to work and how much they hate their jobs. All their customers that come in on holidays are losers as they stated and those who come in at or near Christmas are nothing but a**holes per your staff on 8/31 at 421pm. Will never come back to this location.

We go here for every thing, its our go to location. The service is great, the food is great, and all around it's not a bad place.   It is rather pricey but you have to expect that. The only thing I wish is that I could finish my meal you get so much yet you are craving more.   The show is great, the sense of humor etc. I have nothing bad to say about this place, we keep going back and always enjoy ourselves.

From the time I called, to arriving, to the massage, to leaving this place is awesome. I left my last place because the staff just quit caring and my favorite person left. This location is closer to my work but a little further from home but it works. I called they explained the wellness program to me, recommended a few therapist to me. I got scheduled in and showed up that Friday.   From the time I walked in they welcomed me, made sure everything was fine, explained the process, and went through everything.  My therapist was awesome, attentive and worked on my back which has tons of problems. The 90 minutes flew by but I walked out of there feeling so much better then walking in. I signed up for their wellness program and will be back a couple times a month to keep my back from going bad again!   Thanks for the great service, friendly personalities and great atmosphere!

Hands down my favorite Froyo place. My kids love, it, my wife loves it too! It's in our neighborhood and offers quality Froyo!  The price is right for the quality. The staff is always friendly, and even after a few times remembers who you are. They recently expanded to have Gelato and some other things, in my personal opinion shouldn't have because the Froyo was awesome.   This is the best place around, wouldn't drive anywhere else!

I forgot why I didn't go to Jiffy Lube. My oil and filter that should've run me about 30 bucks at the dealer was 150+ here. They didn't tell me until after it was all done. The waiting room at this one is lackluster for a place to wait. I always feel like you have to watch them like a hawk and this is one place you really need to because if you don't, be prepared to take it.

I wish I would have found Dr. Bradley when I moved here years ago.   Pros: She listens, she knows her stuff and she gives you all the time you need. She will prescribe if you need something and will talk you through everything. She is good at referring you out to specialist if she isn't sure or it isn't her expertise.   Cons: If you aren't the first appointment be prepared to wait. However this is because of the pros, she takes her time, she gives you her attention, so you have to wait. i love this con because it means I am not just a number to her!  Location is easy to find, and near my house. She is so easy going and easy to work with. Best doctor I have had ever!

Server was good but the food lacked. Food came out Luke warm and lacked flavor. For the price I could have gone to a few other places for hot flavorful food.   Not only was it warm and not full of flavor the kitchen was so slow it took 35 minutes to get food out which was not even well prepared. This much time I would expect hot food and flavor. My toast for example was only toasted on one side the sausage was reheated from the night before because it was cold on the middle. Two salads and chili and lunch platter and kids corn dogs and it took 35 minutes for what I gather was microwaved.   Really sad I wanted to like the food. Again the server was great but was hammered by his kitchen coworkers.

The food is good, its a great place to, an a great alternative to the Applebee's that doesn't care about customers.   From the wings to the burgers Native New Yorker is good food. This is not fine dining, and I am not sure since I have not been to New York if it's like food there, but it's good food.  Service is a little lacking at times but nothing to important, instead of getting an extra refill on a soda they might miss it. However the manager walks around and is good to notice and get things right, normally apologizing before you even notice.   I would recommend this place to anyone, great for families as well!

We love the gym. They are great with the kids. They are always busy so if you have questions make sure your ok with waiting a little bit. The perk is when it's your turn they take their time to answer all your questions. It is very affordable and a great program.

Went here after a soccer game, worst service, and the food was terrible! There was the big UFC fight that night and we were made to feel like we weren't welcomed even if it was hours before. The food was subpar.   I wouldn't recommend going here at all!

Made an trip out to the Pet Shop. At first when I walked in, it was the run of the mill local pet shop. The staff talking to a regular, three speed bumps (oh wait those were the guard dogs!), and just classic mom and pop feel. They stopped to welcome me and my son in and told us if we needed help to let them know. We ventured to the back were the salt water fish were at.   Salt water selection was low, however its Sunday and I am sure its not a stocking day maybe even far from it. Pricing seemed to be high on some things, low on others, so really averaging out what you would find else where. Corals on the other hand selection was huge, and pricing was great. I have found cheaper online but then you have to sit at home and wait for the box so they don't die in the heat!   Help was great, they were knowledgable and fast to help. They didn't attack you like other stores which was nice. My son has a small fresh water tank so we walked over and found some frogs that he wanted.   All in all I would return, for fish and more. Everyone is friendly, and its a laid back store. With it being a family run business I expected the prices to be much higher and was surprised that they were pretty spot on.   Thanks for the great experience!

My favorite burger place! I used to work near it but now I go anytime I am up near it. The food is great and the service is fun. It's a hole in the wall joint that not many people find, but I will always go for this place. I wouldn't say its health food by 10 miles, in fact I would make sure you're not on a diet and head over here, you will not regret it! The food is just so great, and the spicy ketchup is a must!

This location can be a hit or miss. Most of the time they are on their game, but other times they make you scratch your head. Sometimes its clean, sometimes it isn't. I guess that is what you get with high schoolers that just don't care sometimes.  Over all a good location if its on its game. I tend to have more better experiences than bad. However their loyalty program is a joke it always tells me the same thing. I asked them about it and was told everyone always says the same thing.  The only down side to this location is sometimes their stone isn't cold enough so you get mush rather than ice cream.

I hate to write a bad review but this is one place that deserves a 1 star rating.  To start I walked in and the host was standing with her back to us, coloring on a kids page, It took her co-worker to walk around and notice we were there and that she couldn't hear us saying anything to her.  We came on a night that had live music. Great for the kids and it was a good bad. However we sat in the dining area, at our table there was no way to have a conversation because the music was so loud you had to scream to talk to the person across from you.   Servers left a lot to be desired. My first thought were these were the servers who didn't get picked at other places so they ended up here. Their dress while might be cute for the right body type, instead just looked trashy and unkept. They come to the table about once ever 2 minutes asking if everything is ok, if it is you can say yes, if it is not they can't hear you to get it fixed.  Food, this is where it gets awful. Keep in mind I love Whiskey, the taste and cooking with it myself. However this place has taken Whiskey over to over kill. Our nachos tasted like it, the beans, the bbq, the mac and cheese, no matter what I tried it all had a Whiskey flavor. It was very sad, you can cook with Whiskey but there becomes a point of over kill. My kids got the mac and cheese, and when you have two kids who love mac and cheese slide it back after a bite you have to wonder. We had to wonder my wife tried it, and found it to be dried out and hard, and no flavor at all.  The server brought us the check asked if it was all good, I made a comment about how it was she laughed took my card and ran it. About 15 minutes later she came back dropped off the bill and kept on walking. No manager came by or anything. We left minimal tip 15% and left. This is not a place I would recommend going to.   They have stiff competition in the area with a Zipps open now by them, Garcia's and heck Panda Express is much better.   Don't waste your money to go here.

I can't believe the reviews that are any less than five stars. I have been a fan of Zipps since I have moved to the Phoenix area. This location just opened near our house and I was doing back flips. Sure they have some growing pains of a new location but those are quickly getting worked out.  The food as with all Zipps is what I will call Bar Food, although better quality than you would get in most bars. They have healthier options like my wife likes, and then the stuff with taste like I love! It always comes out hot, and tasting good. They are training cooks still so the food is a little bit different from the Scottsdale location that I go to by my work.  The atmosphere is killer, there are enough TV's to watch what ever game you want. I understand there were some issues with March Madness however this was one of their opening weeks I would expect a problem or two.   Staff is killer as well, friendly and willing to make sure your experience is great. They are there enough to make sure you're needs are met, and not there enough to annoy you.   This is a sports bar, so if I was looking for a nice quiet sit down place for a date with the wife or something quiet I wouldn't go here, but if you want good drinks, great food, and friendly staff this is the place to go.   If you're at work and need a quick lunch but not fast food this is my first choice.

The food is great, a little pricey but what BBQ isn't! I love the sauce and the service too. The location is great at Alma School and Queen creek. The place is always clean, and you never have to worry about parking.  They do great at carry out and always offer different deals around the holidays like smoking turkeys etc.   Love it!

2 years of hell, they did nothing but lie to me, I spent countless hours on the phone with T-Mobile corporate. Customer service here, and follow through are not things they teach. The clerks and management here are clueless, they mess up more than they actually fix. This store has showed me what uncarrier means, no customer service, and they don't care. They sold me an Ipad that was locked by someone, and it took 3 weeks to sort it out. Save yourself the headache, go somewhere else. Switched from Sprint and at least they understood customer service! Went to Verizon and its been 4 days, all my lines, and iPad are up and running and everything they promised has been followed up on! Amazing! If I could give this place negative stars I would!

Went here off of a friends referral. My daughter had been trying to learn at another swim school in Chandler to no success. We hired our baby sitter a trained life guard and still no success. Went here with one of her friends for 2 on 1 instruction and she is accelerating like there is no tomorrow! The staff here is friendly, its clean, and its not over priced! Great place, nice changing area, nice showers, pool and even a great parent waiting/viewing area!  Would highly recomend this place!

I received a letter in the mail from Hendry Home Mortgage. The letter was nothing spectacular but it got my interest more than any of the other offers I was receiving. I went to their website and expressed interest. Within 45 minutes I had a call back that I missed but they left me a voicemail. Travis followed up with me a day later and talked about their company and what they could do for me. He asked me a bunch of questions and looked at the entire picture. He laid out a few options and asked me what I wanted to do or my goal was. I explained to him and he listened. He never pushed the wrong product on me or pressured me into anything.  Throughout the process Travis communicated with me daily if not multiple times a day. He is great with text messaging and email so he isn't blowing up your phone while you are working. Every step of the way Travis kept me updated and made sure we knew what was going on. There were a few times we hit some speed bumps he explained them and told us how we would work through them. There were no surprises, everything that happened was expected to happen or at least explained could have happened.   The loan was almost done and he called my current lender messed something up and his numbers were off. He explained I could either bring money or he could go back and up the amount by just enough to finance it in. I told him I didn't have the cash on hand and it wouldn't be possible we would have to cancel if that was the case and wait a little bit. He told me he would make some calls and get back to me, it wasn't but a few hours before I had a call back, he was able to get my loan upped just enough to cover the small need. Come to find out my current lender had messed up and I got all that extra money back but this was not Hendry's issue at all.  Closing time came, Laura called set up time, I showed up with my wife we signed our lives away as you would expect and we were done. Travis took time out of his day to come down and meet us in person and go over everything with us. Over all this was the best process I have ever been through with all my home buying experience. This was a simple Refi and it was done in no time! From start to finish I felt like I was his only customer, they all took the time to listen, find out what my needs were and took care of them. I would recommend using Hendry any day of the week! They are awesome at what they do!

Great food, clean place, you couldn't ask for much more, oh and friendly staff! I came in and forgot my wallet, even though I was cranky the held the order while I could run home. My daughter and wife went back because I wasn't feeling good, they gave them the order and even gave them a discount. I have been back many times now, and love it!

The last time and this time sat at a table for over 10 minutes with no server. Last time they gave the excuse that the coffee pot was gone. This time I sit here waiting with a coffee pot and still no one. I know this place is new but the service has gotten worse since they opened.

Hands down the best place I have done business in a long time! Honest and fair to say the least. I dealt with Apple, they told me they could upgrade my iMac all I had to do was come see them. I called Experimac and told them and they explained to me that Apple couldn't do what they were saying and explained why. Upon further research they were right, Apple was going to try to sell me a new Mac. I went to see them at Experimac because I could trade in my iMac for a better model and pay very little out of pocket.   They transferred all my files and called me the next morning to pick up my new machine. I brought it home and had an issue. They couldn't see it but the HD was going bad or had an error. They worked to get another system and transfer things. Long story short I spent about 4 hours in their store (by choice) I watched them turn away business to Apple or Sprint, Verizon etc because the person could save money. Not once did I see them just say yes to anything they always asked questions and always made sure the customer was on the winning side.  After several hours here I walked out with a system that is much much much better! All in all they did a fabulous job.   I learned a lot, I had no clue they sold Mac's everything Apple. I thought they were just a repair and upgrade shop but they are much more! I would go here anytime anything Apple doesn't work, or you want an upgrade, or just need another. At a fraction of the price you can walk out of there with your new toy and still have money to go next door and get a steak or the other way and get a doughnut!!   The staff here is A plus! I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!

This location lacking. Customer service is not a top priority. From walking in they only have a few seats. Placed and order for asada burrito, it came with the tortilla and the steak nothing else. I asked about other toppings and was told you could customize it for .50 a topping, nice to know this after I ordered. Ordered Diet Coke was told they only had one and it was for another order, so got a zero.   The food came, it was a rather small portion, I ate it, and still wanted something else. Their menu is good but again no mention that you can customize it.   I fear this is going to be another place in this location to disappear.
