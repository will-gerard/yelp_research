Good thing they deliver because this is the only reason we have ordered from them. We had pork eggrolls that lacked flavor and was kind of mushy on texture. Chicken lomein was not at all good. The lemon chicken had a chemically taste. The fried rice wasn't horrible, but not that great.

Nice staff. Clean resturant. Great place for big groups because it's all the same price. Makes math easy. Food was so so, but consitent on quality and presentation. Would return.

Mcgraths fish house used to be the worst resturant in this complex, but now that that's gone elephant bar is the winner of the worst. The pictures on the menu were like a dating site - easy to be mislead to expect something great to only be disappointed when delivered.   Terriayki chicken that my husband described as being killed, beaten, finely choped, fried beyond recognition, and them being merrinated in soy sauce for a week. The veggies he compared to the left overs found on the stove When the grill was cleaned.   The Asian in my Asian chicken salad must have been left in customs. No matter how many rice noodles are piled on the salad, it just can't be improved.

vegi sandwich was slimy and didn't stay together. restaurant was dirty.  mirrors and pictures looked like they hadn't been attended to in a long time. floors and table were filthy.  no one was available to pick up plates or wipe tables down. I don't think I would return.

Love this place. I always get the hoagie grinder and my husband gets the chicken Parm. My sandwich normally makes a great lunch the next day, depending in how hungry I am. This is a Phoenix staple that everyone should try.

I feel like I am kind of redundant to post along with the other reviews, but I wanted to add my kudos to a great restaurant. For a place that is very chic and "Scottsdale" I was pleasantly surprised at the affordability of the dinner menu. They make it up in the cocktails, of course. I had the grilled vegetables, which were wonderful. You didn't even need the dipping sauce that came with it. My husband had the AZ 88 chicken sandwich. For $8.50 it came as a huge sandwich, fries, fresh fruit and a pickle. A great recommendation if you are looking for something new and fun to do.

Thank you Yelp.com for helping my husband and I find this restaurant. I have been turning to Yelp more often when we run out of ideas for what to eat. It is amazing how important reviews are.   I would give this place 3.75 stars, but since I have to round to the nearest star, 4 isn't to bad. The ambiance is simple, not to fancy. You enter into the front room which is a grocery and bakery and then to the left is the dining area. We started off with the fried ravioli's. They were kind of cold still in the middle, but that didn't stop us from finishing them. Husband had Chicken Parm, which he enjoyed and I had the Angel Hair with Meat Sauce. When I tell you the portions are huge, don't doubt it. I ate lunch for two days after as did my coworkers, with what I had left over.  I would defiantly return. But maybe not rush back.

I love, love, love their pierogis. I even ordered a batch to take home and keep in the freezer. I give four stars because I wasn't too impressed with their sandwiches. Just note, the pierogis are only on Wednesday's.

Awesome iced tea. After a glass and half I was ready to conquer the world! I met the owner and his wife at a the grand opening of a charity thrift shop where they were handing out samples of their coffee and iced tea. This coffee shop is located inside of the Great Indoors and I will definitely visit next time I am shopping there.

My almost three year old son went ballistic when we arrived here he was so excited to shop hockey equipment. Ari was a delightful help picking out equipment for our son. We will be back in the near future to buy more.

Great food. This area needs more BBQ and this restaurant is gong to fill this need. Hubby and I both got pulled pork sandwiches. Sides were coleslaw, potato salad, beans, veggie of the day or green chili Mac and cheese. Family owned. Stop by and check it out.

What a wonderful surprise, this restaurant was. This is a family owned restaurant and they are all so nice and welcoming. I had the kafta plate which was more than enough food. They do a special trick with the rice which makes it taste like no other. You will have to give it a try.

Food was amazing. Friend and I grazed on apps and sides and were very pleased and full! Glad I gave this place a shot in lieu of their current yelp of 3.5 stars.
