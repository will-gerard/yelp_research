Definitely will come back to try more dishes or have the same ones again.  We have been coming to downtown Chandler for some time now but we somehow missed this gem.  The food is absolutely delicious and the ambiance is perfect.  Have gone with a group of people multiple times and it was a mixed order of veg and non veg dishes.  Everyone raved about their dish... so it seems like you can't go wrong with your pick.  Downside is that the wait time is long but the food is delicious, which is why I'll be going back.  We usually grab some vino and wait by the bar for our table.

Just come here and eat. Everything is delicious. If you want to eat a delicious falafel, look no further.  Kabobs? Shawarma? Same thing.  I've been coming here since my ASU days and I definitely missed it when I moved away. I've never heard a complaint or dissatisfaction from anyone who has come here to eat.  It's a casual eatery with tasty food at a great price.   I like to split dishes so I can enjoy the different tastes more.  Although salad is really standard, the dressing is amazing for their signature side salad.

Love this place, one of my husband and mine all time favorites. It's casual but really fun unique food that packs a great fusion flavor.  They allow newbies to try samples, so it would well for bringing people to try it. .. the combo deals are the way to go.

First timers should get a sampler of the beer.  Happy hour is fun whether you are on the patio or in-doors.  It's a great local eatery and brewery, atmosphere is typically laid back and casual.  You'll see a mix of families and gatherings of friends.    They have a wide variety of food to offer.  Their staff is friendly and fairly accommodating. The summer seasonal, Mr. Pineapple is my favorite, although I do really enjoy the winter seasonal too.    You'll come for the beer, enjoy the food, and be able to have a good if not great time.

It was a Sunday night and we were in the mood for sushi and yakisoba so we decided to finally hit up the local spot we drive by whenever we go to Sprouts.  We walk in and wait five minutes or so before anyone approaches us to have us take a seat.  (The place wasn't all that busy, so the wait seemed unnecessary.)  Keeping an open mind and seeing the teppanyaki tables we took a seat and waited for our waitress.  She approaches us and asks us in a rushed voice what we want, we didn't know yet so she rushed off without allowing us to ask any questions.  She comes back a few minutes later and sees us holding our menu and asks as well as answers her own question of if we are ready to order and walks off again.  Now I feel a bit peeved but my husband suggest we just wait it out.  Well we waited another ten minutes before she came back.  We place our order for vegetarian sushi and yakisoba.  She returns promptly to tell us they are out of yakisoba so we said okay, lets get the sushi and see if we want anything else.  About five minutes later she comes back to tell us the chef is too busy and won't make us the sushi we requested.  She asked us if we wanted anything else off the menu and we just stood up and left.    I really dislike giving bad reviews but this place was a total fail in terms of customer service. I was hoping it would have been a fun local spot to enjoy  but I doubt I'll ever go back.  Summary: Not a good spot for those with dietary restrictions (i.e. vegetarians)

Summer evenings on the patio are quite beautiful... I love the casual and relaxed vibe of this restaurant. They also have DJs and live music on some nights.   The place is great for small bites and hanging out. I gravitate towards the bruschetta  options and of course the cheese board. Once we had gone with a larger group and a few preferred sushi over bruschetta, so they ordered food from the sister restaurant that is next door. It wasn't an issue and in fact, I think one of the waiters suggested it as an option. Worked out well, everyone was content.

This place used to be Los Favoritos and at that time it was awesome. The customer service was also fantastic, they were fast and accurate.  I came in last weekend to order about 20 entrées and it was ridiculous how much I had to argue to get sauce.  Even after we determined that they typically give 3 per entree the front lady and guy in the back refused to give me that amount. She was being so slow too... our food came out and got cold by the time the older guy agreed to be reasonable.  They even shorted us on the sides of Pico de Gallo I ordered and paid extra money for.  Seriously displeased. To add extra fuel to our displeasure that night, one of our bean & cheese burritos had chunks of meat in the middle; for the vegetarian family member who was eating that, it was a barf-worthy experience.  We have had numerous issues with them getting our order wrong but we kept going back.. thinking it will get better. The food has been fun to eat on a weekend night when we have the family over. But the customer service needs a serious upgrade.

The tandoori paneer pizza is definitely my new favorite pizza to eat in Phoenix. It's a bit of a drive from Chandler but worth the trek. Tried the veggie explosion as well and that was really tasty. Loved the mushrooms and cherry tomatoes on top. Overall, all the veggies come together to give you an explosion in your mouth. So it's aptly named. And they use fresh jalapeños! I would definitely come back and highly recommend those wanting something different on their pizza to try the Yummys specialty.

Let's just say, they lost a ton of customers. Party of 10 dissatisfied. They sat us in the sun and after we realized it would be too intense, we asked how long it would be to go inside and they told us we have to go to the back of line and wait an hour! Seriously? That was the first flag.  Then we sat without enough silver ware, plates to share our appetizers, or straws for the large mason jars. Second flag.  The chicken with the waffles was overcooked. Grits were tasteless. They up charged for the kids apple juice, which is ridiculous.  Service was horribly slow. I never received a refill for water. Yet another flag.  Manager (Dina) lacks customer service skills. She made it seem like it was our fault for our displeasure despite it clearly being her staff's incompetencies. We saw two sets of empty tables in the shade, but they refused to let us move. And then we saw another party shift there after 20 minutes. She also said "I'll get you fresh ice water to go"... as if that was even a compensation. AND then, she didn't even bring us water.   Parts we liked: waffles were thin and crispy, corn fritters were delicious as were the fried green beans.
