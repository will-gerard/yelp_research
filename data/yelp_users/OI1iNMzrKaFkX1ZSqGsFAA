BEST ICE EVER! At least according to my sister and she is a serious ice connoisseur. No other will do for her. I can't say I notice a difference but I'm not as skilled in the art of ice cubes as she. I can say that in the hot hot summer heat nothing beats a Happy Hour drink from Sonic. Cherry limeade is a classic and should be tried if you have never had one yet. I've strayed off the path to Strawberry Green Tea. I was super excited to learn they make the Strawberry Green Tea just like the Strawberry Limeades and they contain actual pieces of strawberries in the drink! You can get any drink with any of their many flavors so try some different combinations until you find one you like the best. This location does seem to be overrun with customers/under staffed at times but I've only had reasonable wait times. Even if the time was a little on the longer side, the mint on top of that Route 44 drink makes up for it.

A nice Starbucks to grab a drink and sit outside at on a lovely day. I adore the patio at this location and that Jamba Juice is right next door. I have spent a few nicer afternoons chitchatting with friends outside. Inside is a welcoming space good for group meetings (though, only really enough room for one group) or a few small study groups. Customer service is professional and friendly here. I think this might be one of the main hiring locations so it is to be expected you will receive the great, solid, service expect from a Starbucks.

I've always had great customer service from this location no matter what time I go. I've gone from breakfast in the morning to late late night snacks. I usually get potato wedges so I just wish they were a bit more consistent with how much cheese sauce they use. Though, that's just to be expected at drive-thru fast food.

This theater can get a little crowded on weekends when bigger movies open up but otherwise it's never busy. I've been here during the weekdays when it is a ghost town but no matter when I've gone, I have received great service. I personally like the seats and the bathrooms here over other competitors.

This theater is never ever crowded. It's as if I have won the movie watchers lottery as I am greeted by the cold a/c and super friendly and super helpful staff! The bathrooms are clean and well stocked whenever I have used them. (Probably because the building is in desperate need of human contact from the lack of customers but I digress.) Matinee movies are $5. Seats do not hurt my back. It is definitely a matter of personal preference but for me it's all I could wish for in a movie going experience. Thank you!

Awe, looks like I might be the only person who has had a good experience here. I needed to return and swap out some items that I didn't use from my recent visit to a Tempe Marketplace location the day before.   All of the employees I encountered were wonderful. I had questions about the best way to seal glitter to an ornament. I got helpful and knowledge answers. I wish I got my cashiers name cause she was great!   This location was far less ransacked than yesterday's location. I think the biggest issue here is that this store appears very understaffed for the busy holiday season so during peak hours finding an associate proves rather difficult.   FYI: There is a button by the spray paint so if you desperately need help you could try that. I would use it sparing or if you actually need some spray paint. Luckily, I did!

We've been coming to this location for probably 8 years now but it's just not the same. Every previous time was fantastic but this was just sad. Apparently, they don't don't believe in ac anymore cause it was uncomfortably hot. And maybe because of said hotness I might have been a little extra cranky but if your studio is packed full of people maybe every once in a while someone should walk around and check on customers. Nope. They didn't do that once. Okay fine. I'll let the laziness go but when a worker is on the studio floor eat a meal with a friend, that starts to get to me. Still I could have let THAT go but the final straw was the girl who rang us up couldn't have been ruder and less happy to be there. Sorry, we ruined your day by needing to be rung up since you were so busy standing around doing nothing. My apologizes. This store's manager needs to get there staff in check ASAP.

This is nice Trader Joe's. I don't love it as much as the Tempe one but it's still good. This store just can feel a little cramped, probably because it's a bit of a smaller location, and I feel like sometimes I have to dig for fresh produce behind the ones in front. If you can get here when they first open there are no lines at all and you still receive the same great friendly service.

A lovely Starbucks indeed. The staff at this location really makes the place great. They are so nice and have the best awkward small talk conversations that I have ever had at a Starbucks. They almost always manage to successfully convince me to buy a cute adorable cookie as well. Nicely done!   Inside is mostly filled with chairs rather than tables and the few tables they do have are pretty small. Don't expect to be able to have a large monthly book club or writer's group meet up here for a discussion. Not really gonna happen unless it's cooler and you do it at the outside tables.   The bathrooms are clean except for the floors. The floors always seem to look like someone with dirty shoes walks all over them right after they were mopped. I'm not sure if that's just how they look or if that is what is really happening, but that is the only little bump at this store.

We have gone to many veterinarians over the years and Dr. Kern is by far the most knowledgable one we have ever seen and the most reasonably priced. While many people have commented about her beside manor being less than chipper, I feel that her seriousness demonstrate far more care and concern for your furry friends than flashy fake smiles looking to get into your wallet. She values each and every animals life. Even after being a veterinarian for so long, you can see she takes still the hurts if she can not save an animal. I don't think you could ask for anything more than someone who cares as much as you do about helping your four-legged family members.

All hail the Queen of Dairy! We bow down in your royal honor...but mostly, I praise your highness because of your mouthwatering banana splits. How I have missed those three mountains of soft serve goodness topped with chocolate, strawberries, pineapple and whipped cream surrounded by a whole banana. Your dipped cones, Blizzards, and sundaes are pretty splendid as well. Thank goodness the drive-thru here is so speedy because today is a cheat day and I can't wait no more! Whoa, the calorie count on a banana split is only 530 -- even better! Yes, the super polite DQ employees make the visit a breeze. Now, please hand over that delicious cold treat that I've been craving.

I had a really good experience at this location. I arrived eager with my thumb drive in hand. Only to quickly have my eye glaze over in fear of uncertainity on which machines to use for my projects. I was quickly greeted by the super nice and helpful staff, who set me on the right track. Even though the machines were having some technical difficulties, the issues were soon fixed and I was on my printing journey.   I used a couple different machines and I highly recommend most. However, the Sony photo print station, while the actual prints were pretty good, my images got chopped off a bit from the file to the print. Not a ton but something to really keep in mind. I even left space on the original file to be sure there was enough room just in case this were to happen. I suggest leaving even more room than you expect you might need. It was most noticeable on the top margin of the print. I printed 8x10s and they are $4.99 a pop so it isn't very practical to go to town printing out more copies if there are mistakes.  Overall, this store definitely knows how to get the job done!

Thinking about Video Paradise gives me those nostalgic warm and fuzzies. Even after large big box competitors had fallen this gem continued on for over 25 years. The vast library of films were watched over by the too cool for school, sunglass wearing, pink flamingo mascot that greeted all that dared to enter into paradise. In honor of this film rental super haven bidding us a very fond farewell, here are 5 classic movie quotes to help say goodbye:  5. "I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief because there will be so much to look forward to." - Donnie Darko (2001)  4. "I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-Beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die." - Blade Runner (1982)  3. "So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye...Goodbye." - Sound of Music (1965)  2. "I know now why you cry. But it's something I can never do. Goodbye." - T2 (1991)  1. "I'll be right here..." - E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  So as the music swells in the background, and the tears stream down our faces, we will be sure to remember all the good times we had with you, Video Paradise.

So after having to hunt down an American Eagle location that was still open for business (Tempe Market and Fiesta Mall locations have both closed), I came to the Chandler location. I wasn't too thrilled to do so because on previous visits the customer service has been average at best. Though this last visit changed my mind. I got fantastic service doing my returns and exchanges! I usually dread doing returns. It seems at most places sales people tend to treat you like a plague on humanity once they realize you aren't spending money in their store but that didn't happen here. The staff went out of their way to make me feel important and help me get the item I wanted to exchange online since they didn't have it in the store. WOW! I was just blown away. Keep up the fantastic work AE Chandler!

This location is ALWAYS crazy busy but yet seems to gives some of the slowest Starbucks service ever seen. Mind boggling when you consider the fact that the store is right outside of the mall. Guess they know the caffeine dependent customer fan-base will be there no matter what they do so why try?

Have you ever dreamed about being Belle from Disney's Beauty and the Beast?  Peculiar?  Nose stuck in a book?  Annoying piece of hair that keeps falling in front of your face?  Check, check, and double check!   Well, Book Gallery is probably one of the closest, and I might I add more reasonably priced, experiences someone can have to becoming the nerdiest of all the fictional princesses. I'm not exactly sure what the store's policy is on musical numbers and/or rolling around on their ladders, so perhaps it might be best to hold off on ALL the elation if you can. Though, I highly doubt anyone would blame you if you couldn't contain your excitement.    The store is multiple levels and there are an endless amount of categories to explore from "true crime" to "whaling" to "cooking" and "cats"! I'm positive you can even find a section on "pirates".   So get lost exploring far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, people in disguise and if you are lucky you might just step on a creaky floorboard in the mystery section or find a rare treasure hiding in the glorious maze of books.

Outrageously priced. I get they have state of the art equipment but we couldn't afford to use any of it. While the staff is super friendly we did have one of the doctors say, after we couldn't pay to have anymore tests done, that it wouldn't be bad if we choose to put our dog down. I have no idea how a person can be so cold. Do no harm, right? Our dog only stayed 24 hours at the place and it ran us around $2000. We took our dog somewhere else that was much more affordable and they saved his life. He stayed at the other place for about a week. Same treatment and it cost us less than the one day at VCA.

Poor Golfland Sunsplash, you get a bad rap. Maybe it's because I don't have children that I like you. I like you enough to even tolerate people that let their children hop all over the place ruining a relaxing evening of very unskilled mini golf. I don't care if you are outdated. I appreciate the nostalgia and will continue to visit it you once every year or so just to enjoy all the memories and have some good times.

By far my favorite Trader Joe's. The layout is great. Very easy to navigate. The staff is friendly without it being annoying. Yummy samples, super fresh produce and fast checkouts. The only down side is the parking lot is always crazy busy. I've never seen it empty ever. I suppose that is a great sign though that they won't have to worry ever about staying in business.

WARNING: I really enjoy puns. They crack me up.   I would like to eggs-press how pleasantly surprised I was with my egg-cellent eggs-perience at T.C. Eggington's. The waitstaff is egg-spectionally delightful and the atmosphere is cozy. Egg-spect to see long lines of egg-cited people during the weekend waiting to get in on the egg-stravaganza but the line moves pretty fast so no need to get over easy about it.  Make no yokes about it, these cooks are eggs-perts because the food is absolutely egg-strodinary! I've tried scrambled eggs to omelettes. At T.C. Eggington's they will make it eggs-actly your way. No eggs-ageration! Even if you want one of their sandwich combinations in an omelette - they will go the eggs-tra mile to make it happen.   The O'pear and Eggington's omelette are the most popular items on the menu for a reason - they are an eggs-polsion of flavor in your mouth. The apple cinnamon jelly is also too good to egg-nore. It is available on all the tables so I'm b-eggin' you to try it on your English muffin that comes with most of the meals.  Drinks are only $5 so you have no egg-cuse not to try a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa unless you are egg-specting a little one.   I'm a little eggs-austed now but I finally have the satisfaction of feeling like Vincent Price in an old school Batman episode. No need to continue egggin' me on, I know when it is time for me to egg-zit! But if you want a breakfast or brunch egg-cursion that leaves you sunny side up then go to T.C. Eggington's.  That's all yokes!

A previous reviewer said "I can reach out and touch set pieces", I dare say the set pieces touch you! They really make sure to use many different areas of the theater making the "stage" all around you and during the show I saw, audience members were asked to hold various pieces of the set! That means that every seat really is a unique experience. I can't remember the last time I've had so much fun at a show. I have to think it must be because of the smaller theater size and the interaction of the performers with the audience. This theater is such a gem. Definitely will be back!

Absolutely no idea how I became the duchess of this location after only two visits!! It seems improbable since the drive-thru line always appears cray-cray busy when I pass by on my way to work. The employees I've encountered here are friendly. Not much shade from them (nice) or actual shade from cover to sit underneath (not so nice). The outside area can get very sunny and there are few places to sit. Also, there are no bathrooms available to use at this location. So overall not a great spot to stop at to have a meeting or to work on projects, but a nice convenient (though often busy) drive-thru location near downtown Tempe.

After some extensive and pivotal research, it has been proven that by far Urban Cookies has the best cupcakes that I've ever had in AZ!   I finally caught the reaired episode of Cupcake Wars where Urban Cookies competed as Ollie Cakes. In case you haven't seen the episode, SPOILER ALERT: They WON! That's right! These cupcakes win wars!   A highlight is their Orange Blossom cupcake, which is really something special. It is an oil olive cake with orange zest topped with a rosewater buttercream frosting (and rose petal as many of the photos show). The cake is airy in texture from the olive oil with nice citrus and floral notes. Not your average cupcake at all! I appreciate having unique options to try along with classics like the classic, a rich chocolate cake and vanilla buttercream. Yum!   Don't forget about the drool worthy and daydream inducing cookies that are baked here! Their signature Dark Chocolate Walnut cookie fuses massive dark chocolate chunks side by side with shreds of coconut, pieces of walnuts, and oats = AMAZING! My personal favorite might be their Pineapple Coconut cookie which is a little piece of a tropical vacation in every bite.   Urban Cookies has many gluten free and vegan options meaning that no matter what your dietary restrictions or personal preferences may be you are covered. Kind of like the dipped macaroons that are covered in dark chocolate. (They also happen to be an excellent gluten free option to sample).  With so much to try from tons of cupcakes, cookies, dessert bars, baked donuts and seasonal treats, Urban Cookies provides comforting favorites and a delicious variety of sweets that is never boring and always a delight.

The store is large and well organized. Browse through tons of books, movies, music, games and other various and random finds. While you might already be here trading in your unwanted old and used goodies, did you know that Bookmans also holds a variety of events for all ages throughout the year? Everything from storytime, crafting, book signings to musical guests, and pet adoptions. You are sure to find a way to stay busy.   Level-Up:  - Bookmans is dog friendly as long as your pooch is on a leash.    (Not sure if this includes cats too?)

Buying tickets online or on the touch screen outside is super easy and kind of fun. The new reclining seats are so comfortable and make the experience more like being at home but with a huge screen and mega surround sound. The only downside is that the theaters now hold less seats to accommodate the larger chairs. That means opening weekend can prove difficult to see say... the new Marvel movie. Otherwise the place is typically not crowded. Just plan ahead if you want to get a group to go to a bigger movie. The bathrooms could use some music or promotional advertisement (I'll take whatever you wanna give me) because they are creepy quiet and perhaps not the cleanest. By perhaps, I mean, definitely not the cleanest and kind of gross that I'm repressing opening half the stall door until I found a passable clean one. However, no wait for popcorn! (Probably, should have mentioned that part first.) Oh, and when you leave be prepared for your hair to look all sorts of messes up from the chairs but you sure were comfy!

Always great customer service here. I have such a hard time choosing a flavor because they have so many! I had a bad experience with boba before and kind of swore it off but this place changed my mind. Their boba is really fantastic here! Soft and just the right amount of chewy. And if you are looking for a delicious and refreshing treat, try the diamond ice. It's super tasty!

How have I not written a review about this Target?! I've never been much of a Walmart fan so if I need supplies of any kind you'll find me at Big Red. It's like my home away from home. I swear they probably keep a small foldaway bed in housewares for me or at least a small honorary chair... I'm there that much. Why? Because I prefer the layout of this location much more than other locations. Even if this were not the closest location to me, I would still probably frequent it solely based on that alone. However, the store is typically clean and organized except during the chaos of holidays which is to be expected and the parking lot is a breeze to navigate. It might have been mention by someone else but I, too, miss that darn garden center entrance and fresh plants. If only it still existed... ::sigh:: ...we will always have the memories.

Coming in at a towering 5'2, I convinced myself I could order a maxi (floor-length) dress and it would fit when it arrived. Ha. Any short person knows this was delusional on my behalf. After a much too long overdue wait, and a recommendation from my sister, I had Happy Dry Cleaners do the alterations.   They did an amazing job!   During the same visit I needed to replaced a zipper on my favorite fancy pants slacks. I just asked for the zipper but they fixed my buttons free of charge too! I had no idea the buttons were even that loose until I saw how nice they could actually look after they had been fixed.   All of the alterations were very reasonable and I plan to bring a few more items in to get adjusted in the future.  COST BREAKDOWN:  Shorten Straps on dress = $10 Hem on dress = $20 (5 inches taken off!) New Zipper on pants = $15  Being able to pretend I can order items online that are clearly intended for someone who is much taller than I actually am = Priceless.  Thank you, Happy Dry Cleaners!

Maybe I'm a little jaded when it comes to "clearance centers" but the original prices here seem highly marked up to make the discounts seem more impressive than they really are. I purchased a Kensie blouse (and it was 100% Rayon) that showed the original tag price of $79.00. That's high! I happened to know this off the top of my head but you can also do a quick check online and see that at competitors a comparable blouse sells for $50.00 max but typically around $40ish. I ended up spending $20 for the blouse after the added additional discounts (30% off the lowest marked price). Not a horrible sum but definitely not the fantastic deal that they make it out to be. But all sales are FINAL so no buyers remorse for me... I'll pass from now on unless I need a reasonably priced sequined dress. They've got plenty of those if you need one!

Whenever we go to this location we regret it. The service we receive is subpar. One of the rudest things an employee can do is be in the middle of ringing you up and start helping another customer. This has happened twice here. This current time I just needed to pay a bill but apparently they don't know how long the wait will be...it already had been a long wait. It was so long of a wait another customer who was there before me left saying very loudly "I'm going to Verizon!" before they ever got assistance. This location makes me want too switch companies as well. The lady who appears to be the one in charge here has no idea what she is doing. I feel bad for the other workers who do attempt to help you but can't because of her. Hopefully, they get new management in there fast! I've also heard multiple workers exclaim to customers about the phone they are selling "we are all out" or "this is our last one". Really? Are you that low in stock? How is this location even still in business. Makes you wonder!

HH is fantastic! $3 Margaritas are what Happy Hour should be about after all! They also offer select appetizers for $3 & $5. A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well.   You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so.   In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you.   No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)

Poor poor Fiesta Mall. So sad to watch it die a very very very slow drawn out death. It all started back when Chandler Mall opened up. Fiesta was never able to compete. Since then it just keeps getting worse. Now about only half the stores are open. Macy's is gone. Forever 21 is gone. American Eagle is gone. The Body Shop is gone. Victoria's Secret is gone. Cinnabon is gone. Cinnabon! Why??! Seems like once a store's lease is up they get out and that's sad. With MCC so close to the Fiesta you would think that with proper management this mall could be saved or re-imagined or something. Look at In and Out and Dutch Bros and how busy those places are all the time. The lines are always so long! Obviously, there is business around the area but the stores are not. Still I hope for nice things to happen. I wish you good luck, Fiesta! Just hold on to Best Buy for as long as you can because it is about all you have left.

Let us pause for a moment of silence: . . . . . . . . .  Fresh and Easy, or as some of us would call you "Freasy", you were a true friend through both, the good times and the bad.   For a while there, you were even open 24 hours/7 days a week. Just in case, a run for 5 pints of uniquely flavored ice cream was needed in the middle of the night or if someone was making Indian food and forgot how to make Tikka Masala, your jarred version was there to lend a hand, or if someone just needed discounted veggies, meat or yogurt.   While you were always there, you still had standards and many of us respected you for that. Such as no buying alcohol between the hours of 2 AM and 6 AM. Way to stay true to you, Fresh and Easy!!  NOOOOOOOOOO! Why did you leave us too soon Freasy?!! Why?!!!  You shall be dearly missed.    In the short time that we knew you, you brought so much to many, like your phenomenal Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. You may be gone now, dearest, but you shall never be forgotten.   We lay our Friends Cards down in your honor as we bid you a fond farewell. May the memory of you in our hearts always remain easy and fresh.

Finally I feel like a real adult because I got a Costco card this year! Granted, as part of a family membership, but lets not get hung up on semantics. It doesn't change the adult quota stock points. I eat dessert for breakfast, go to bed when I wanna, and get giddy from the idea of spending under $4 for a pack of 40 water bottles.   BAM!   ::adult card thrown down::  The cafe prices are unbeatable so don't forget to bring some cash to spend on a hot dog, slice of pizza, churro, or giant cup of soft serve on your way out the door.   As for the poor guys up front, towards the entrance, that ask to speak to you for a moment about DirectTV (Seriously, why? Oh, right-right, because I'm an adult). I feel so bad that I brush them off (because let's be honest that's probably what everyone else does too), but I don't have time for that when I've got some free samples to indulge in, comfy sweatpants to check out, need to stock up on food like I'm feeding a few very hungry soccer teams or filling the shelves in an underground bomb shelter, and most importantly, to hug MEGA-JUMBO Teddy Bears (when they are in season)...because that is what an adult does!

The employees working at this location are sweet and everything nice like their beverages! In typically fashion, we took for.....ever to make a decision on what to drink. The barista assisting us was very patience and offered up friendly suggestions after quizzing us on what we usually drink at other coffee & tea spots. We ended up getting an Iced Cookie Butter Latte (a sweet holiday treat) and a Winter Dream Tea (rooibos, black tea and spices). Tasty drinks but they were not as memorable as the outstanding service that really made this location a great little spot to stop and get a drink.

Ugh, this location makes me sad. A ton of greeters at the door talking amongst themselves. Hardly any employees further back in the store when you actually have a question and could use the help but the worst part is the fact that they have six cash registers but only two open. It's December on the weekend. The line was unnecessarily long possibly just a clever ploy to get you to buy the stocking stuffers at the checkout. However my cashier was not happy and didn't try to up-sale me. I'm a sucker and would have bought. With a little effort, this store could easily have bigger sales and more happy customers. Come on now.

What can I say that hasn't been said about Cornish? Start with an order of oven fries, grab a delectable pasty and finish off with some banoffee. The food and drinks are always phenomenal. The same can't really be said about the service. I wouldn't recommend getting take out here. I certainly don't anymore. Only dine-in because at least then the mistakes can be fixed. Thus saving you a trip back when you realize you are missing parts of your order or if you happen to received the wrong pasty. It is about 50-50 from my experience on them getting orders right. While the service is often lacking, the food, atmosphere and good times tend to make up for it.

Nom nom nom nom...   Oh, what's that?   That's the sound of me stuffing my face full of food from Dragon Express. The food here is super fresh, perfectly cook (that zucchini - flawless) and has fabulous flavor! Service was friendly and patient as we hummed and hawed deciding what to order and the food came out fast in under 10 minutes.   Couldn't be happier with the experience!

Total Wine might just be one of my favorite places on earth. A regular adult Wonderland of fun, joy and future inebriation. Where fully grown adults practically skip down the aisles.   Yes, it has a lot of do with the fact they sample delectable drinks that induce an extra gregarious mood but there are many other wonderful points to be made about this delightful establishment. Such as the vast selection of products they carry, the extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff, and their great deals on prices. (I'm so so sorry other store slightly down the way that shall not be named.)   Now if you do excuse me I must finish pushing my cart full of booze, that possibly makes me look like a raging alcoholic or that I am having a very very very large gathering, to my car.

I might have a problem with waiting too long to write reviews for places I really enjoy. Another one bites the dust: Goodbye, Fry Bread House East!   I had a solid "love/hate" relationship with FBHEast. I loved the delicious indulgent fried food here but my body absolutely would shut down into a full-on food coma afterwards. Plans would need to be crossed of the schedule because a good hard nap was needed for a full food coma recovery. It was well worth any food struggles that had to be endured, but only once in a while for special occasions, of course.  Don't worry the Phoenix location still stands! Hooray! So if a fixin' for fluffy fried bread topped savory or sweet (or both) hits, a quick trip to the heart of the Valley will satisfy those cravings.

PERK: This location is right by the freeway.  COUNTER-PERK: This location is right by the freeway.   As Starbucks locations go this one was a little bit of a letdown. The barista that rang me up was friendly. However, many of the tables were dirty and the wait time for my drink seemed long considering there was no line of customers. Outside seating is pretty close to the drive-thru & was noisy from the traffic in the area. Not as relaxing as one would hope for an afternoon drink delight.

One day about 2 years ago to cheer my mom up I gave her plant from this store. When I gave the small potted flower to her, I was very clear to not have high expectations since it came from the 99 cent store. Shockingly, to my surprise, that silly little plant grows back strong and cheers her up yearly now.  I used to visit this store more when Fresh and Easy was right next door. Sadly, I have been here less since it closed. Since my previous visits, the store seems to have expanded upward and has many more products. They have a large refrigerated area in the back and now a ton of wine too.   Another one of the reasons I enjoy this store so much is because they always have a large amount of holiday decorations no matter the holiday. A huge requirment I look for in a 99 cent store. Birthday balloons, fun toys, festive garland, various wrapping paper, shiny bows and random sparkly things you didn't think you need but now somehow you do. Thanks for the awesome Spiderman sandwich carrier, btw! All of these items live at this store.   The employees are friendly and helpful. Perhaps, maybe a little too talkative, but sure, let's have a conversation during check out like I'm at Dutch Bros. Very pleasantly pleased after my many visits so thanks for being so stellar!

This location is an okay size and seems to have a decent stock of party supplies and holiday decorations. However, a grumpy sales clerk can really dampen a shopping experience.  Maybe the guy was having a bad day but don't take your poor mood out on customers. He was completely unhelpful when I asked if they had a particular item in back. Immediately saying "no" without another word.   Yikes! Attitude check at the front lanes. No checking with another employee or offering to double check in the back or even explaining that absolutely everything they have is on the sales floor. All acceptable reactions that would have been well received beside the irritated one word answer.  FYI: In case it might be helpful to know, you can purchase items online and they can be sent to the store. Gosh, maybe that is what he meant by "no."

Don't let the outside of the place fool you, the inside is a regular hubbub of activity. You can watch full grown adults try to inconspicuously push other smaller adults and children out of the way whilst smushing their face up against the glass window to get a better view of the chefs hand pulling noodles. It's simply mesmerizing to watch. Not only was there prime window watching going on but the rest of the place was crazy busy too. Packed full of people and for a reason because the food is delicious, prices are beyond reasonable and the service is solid.

Can't beat the price ! I gorged myself at the dinner buffet and happily accepted my food coma later! Awesome that the mango lassi is INCLUDED in the buffet! The paneer tikka masala was my favorite! Only minus a star because our group needed more garlic naan and we are pretty sure the "refill" came from another table that had just left. Um, thanks? That still doesn't take too much away from the deliciousness that was the meal.

A must to stop at when visiting in the mall since we have a caramel apple addicted in our household. Every time I have stopped in the store I have received exceptional service. The staff is friendly and politely waits while you take your time picking out treats. I highly recommend the jalapeño cheddar popcorn. Such a guilty pleasure but so good!

Oh my stars and garters, with Batman out front and a creepy Joker inside, Gotham City Comics (and Coffee) is full of character! -WOW!-  Holy, fandoms unite!   Whovians, Browncoats, Scoobies, Trekkies, Bronies, Potterheads, Jedi, and Avengers assemble...  Because there is something for every superheroes, villain and citizen to enjoy at Gotham. -SHAZAM!-  Have a ball perusing the cool items the store has to offer from (of course) comics - old and new, figurines, cards and more! All in the comfort of an fun AND welcoming environment. -WHOOSH!-   The staff is knowledgable -POW!- and helpful -BANG!- and not pushy at all. -ZAP!-  Usually, there are groups debating the latest pop culture news or people playing games each time I have stopped in the shop. -ALLONS-Y!- They have evenings of watching Doctor Who or playing Magic (and probably other nights I am not aware of yet). -WHAM!- And there is a charming coffee bar that even offers slushies! -BOOM!-  "All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest to lunacy. That's how far away the world is to where I am. One bad day" - The Joker   No need to worry, -BAM!- G.C.C. is here to help chase all those bad days and boogeymen away! -SPLAT!-

Zoyo is an Arizona based frozen yogurt company that has locations all over the valley. We could talk about how frozen yogurt, aka "diet ice cream", has many health benefits like live and active cultures for happy tummies or that it is a source of calcium and protein but...  Let's get to the really important stuff such as the super fun flavors! Oatmeal cookie, salted caramel, fruity pebble and I about lost all sanity when I saw they had a nutter butter flavor!  This location is clean and they have a myriad of toppings including fresh fruit, mochi, popping pearls and nuts. Oh, and there also might be whip cream topping, syrups, sauces, and more than one option of chocolate...Not saying I noticed or anything.   The staff is friendly, yet, somehow checking out always seems to take longer than expected. I have a feeling their computer system just doesn't like me. Overall, this Zoyo is one of my preferred froyo spots to visit.

Throughout history we have been plagued by deep philosophical questions: Why do you always want what you can't have? Why did the chicken cross the road? And why does the craving for Chick-fil-A hit on Sunday?   No matter. Chick-fil-A is good any day of the week!   Making it through to Monday for the deep-fried in peanut oil cravings to subside is well worth it just to indulge in those waffle fries once again.   And the sauces: Buttermilk Ranch, Honey Mustard, Chick-fil-A Sauce, Honey Roasted BBQ, Polynesian. What is in those sauces that makes them taste so good? No, seriously, what is in them? Does anyone have a recipe that even comes close? 'Cause today is Sunday.

Do you find yourself asking friends to build a snowman, even though you live in the burning dry oven heat of Arizona? Do you imagine a train falling of a cliff when you can't remember what you were saying? Sob uncontrollably at one, possibly all, of the Toy Story movies?  If you answered yes to any of the above questions then you know The Disney Store is the place where the dreams that you wish in your heart can come true. Especially, if your dreams involve trying to fit yourself into xxl kid size dress and children shoes so you can pretend to be a princess. Whoops. Did I say that out loud? This is awkward...     Yeah, you will slightly groan little inside when you realize that Yoda and Chewie live here along with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Jack Skellington, Buzz, Woody, Dumbo, Bambi, Baymax, Kermit, Piggy, Gonzo, Tigger, Winnie the Pooh, Maleficent, about 7 dwarfs, a tiny mermaid, clown fish who have a knack for getting lost, some pirates, Mulan, Cinderella, Pluto, Mickey and Minnie.   ::sigh::   However, the store is setup brilliantly, has TONS of merchandise and is a lot of fun. So while you hum It's A Small World to yourself at the check out counter, take a moment to pause and enjoy the movie that is being projected in the Enchanted Forest or contemplate how to make the sparkly glitter tile work in your own home. (Yes, I wish I had that tile too!)

First time visiting a Papyrus store. The shop's cards, stationary, gifts, and wrapping for all occasions were super organized. They also offer some really uniquely designed products. Papyrus seems like a great place to get ideas if you are into making cards and need inspiration. Unfortunately, we were not acknowledged by the store employees what-so-ever. A shame because with a little bit of a push I could have easily been convinced to buy a card or two. However, on my own according I just couldn't bring myself to spend the higher price point even though the cards are absolutely beautiful.

This location is pretty friendly and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for my pizza. It is a take it and bake it yourself place so I do wish it was slightly cheaper since you are doing most of the work but they always have coupons everywhere! Just check online before you go or check the in the mail. They often have coupons there too.

Could the employees here get anymore attractive?! Geez, it is like an Abercrombie ad. I practically expect to see Zac Efron walk out the door serving drinks. That being said, I've also received outstanding service each drop in for grub. During this most recent visit, server Rodrigo was even kind enough to move an umbrella so the glaring sun would not hit us in the face anymore! The food is pretty solid and I love the rotating seasonal options. Thirsty Lion is definitely one of the places I prefer to eat while dining at TMP.

So you are telling me all the food trucks I could ever dream of are in one place?? That sounds like a blast! Fantasies of fried food, sweet desserts, and food comas now dance through my mind. My stomach says game-on!   Wait, you mean I still have to wait in those crazy food truck lines?? With no shade? The rest of me is sad. Very sad. With each long line my excitement has now turned into more and more disappointment.    Unfortunately, this event sounds way more amazing in theory than in reality. You mostly wait in lines for way overpriced food, only to not be able to find a place to sit and enjoy the treats you wish to devour.   If you do decide you want to try out this festival, definitely invest in VIP tickets. That will most likely improve your experience because you'll get more booze and have a place to sit and eat in the VIP area.

Empty waiting room when we arrived. Now 8 people are waiting. The appointment was set for 1:45. Got here 30 mins early as asked to "fill out a paperwork" (get asked questions for the computer database.) Asked at 2:15 what was the hold up? "You will be seen shortly" was the response. Seems pretty typical of this place. Definitely be prepared to wait and wait and wait...Oh my goodness, the waiting.   Bring a book, find some nice articles to read online or write a Yelp review! However, once we actually were seen then the process went fast. Hooray for that!

This store is always so organized. I have no idea how they do it! Makes me feel like someone is hiding behind fixtures just waiting to bat hands away from the merchandise because it looks that clean. Most retail store look like they have been hit by a F-5 tornado but this mysterious wonder boggles my mind everytime I step foot inside its magical doors. The checkout line can be unnecessarily long at times but for the most part it moves fast. Overall a very enjoyable experience when you are in need the prefect accessory to go with that special outfit.

Oh my goodness indeed! I just had a buffalo bird slider and it was amazing! It was a spicy ground chicken patty with blue cheese and carrot and cabbage slaw. So so good! Nice and friendly service too! They even were able to wrap my order to go. Now I just need to try their Mac & Cheese balls. They were all sold out tonight :(

Was it destiny that brought us to Fate? Or did Fate become our destiny?  Fate Brewing Company specializes in wood-fired pizza and small batch beers with fun names like "Oh My Gatos!", "Totes McOats" and "Fate-Ality". Not a very large spot to hang out so expect the possibility of a little bit of a wait, but the servers were relatively attentive despite being ultra, mega, super busy.   Personally, I'm a cider gal so I was happy to see that they offer Ciderboys Strawberry Magic in bottles. Which if you have never sampled before, Strawberry Magic smells like a daydream of skipping through fields of strawberries and sunshine (and tastes equally as wonderful)!!  We tried a pizza with half, Truff N Stuff - olive oil, mozzarella, red onion, arugula, shaved parmesan, and lemon truffle vinaigrette and half, The Jess - cheese, baby spinach, bacon, roasted garlic. While Truff N Stuff was good, The Jess was definitely the standout and full of flavor. Yum!  Really pleased with this visit and can't wait to try Fate - South sometime as well!

As you step onto the festival grounds you are greeted by an amazing smell. There is tons of food to eat including: moussaka, pastitso, spanakopita, gryos, dolmathes, and saganaki (flaming cheese!) The list of delicious treats can go on and on but let's hear it for the baklava. Do not leave without getting a piece of the buttery honey soaked filo pastry treat.   The festival is not very large but utilizes both the indoor and outdoor areas of the location.   Every hour on the hour church tours are provided. The church is stunning. The artwork on the walls and the beauty of the structure can easily be appreciate by all people of any background.   The outside area of the festival does not offer much cover from the sun so I would highly advise keeping that in mind while dressing for the occasion, using sunscreen, and/or bringing an umbrella to use for shade to avoid over exposure to the sun.   However, the outdoor eating/entertainment space is covered by a large tent so you can take a rest in the shade to enjoy the dancers in traditional clothing and listen to some Greek music.    Overall the event is a fun way to spend a few hours getting stuffed on delicious Greek food. Maybe in the future there could be some more interactive areas to the event. Perhaps even be a place to break plates?! Could be fun! Opa!

Satay Hut was at the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court a couple weeks back and even with the tough competition, I decided to get food from their truck. Totally happy I did! My order came out faster than the other people I was with, who were waiting on food from other trucks! Nicely done. The food was really good. I got a meal and I felt it was the right amount of food to be filling but not stuffed. I also really liked they had a vegetarian meal option too!

The Hot Chocolate 15/5K run or as I like to call it, "walk at a slightly faster pace" is one of the only events like this that I have participated in, here in the valley, on my almost free will. (Seriously, how much free will or will power can there be when chocolate is involved?) I don't even think I own a real pair of sneakers but the promise of hot chocolate can convince me to do a lot of things.   With that in mind, as someone who know absolutely nothing about running other than from my elementary school days, I thought the event was very well organized and the course was pleasant even for a novice.    The well deserved hot chocolate you earn is delicious. Thick and full of flavor. Smart choice on that one organizers. Could the hot chocolate at the end of the race be bigger? Ah, yeah! But probably nothing short of getting to drench yourself in a  bath of chocolate at the end would be enough. It could always be bigger. Maybe you could get two cups? No? Can't hurt a girl for trying.   I have a feeling though many other runners were not solely motivated by the promise of delicious treats at the finish line. The proceeds from the run go to Ronald McDonald House Charities in each city the race is ran. The cost to run also includes a hoodie which you pick up prior to the event and can wear during the run. It is a nice way to make everyone feel like they belong whilst the faster runners push you out of the way for being too slow.   Also, there are many photo opts during the run and afterwards you receive an email to claim the photos if you so choose. This seems pretty typical but is a nice way to remind you of how you friends tricked you into waking up early that day for good parking.  Maybe I can just volunteer next time. They get chocolate too, right?

Stopped in right when they opened a few Sundays back. I think this caught them a little off guard but we were hungry. The place is small but that is what is kind of great about it. Plus, the amazingly comfy chair! I didn't believe the other reviews either. I asked myself "How can chairs be that comfortable?" but they really are!!  With the food, they certainly don't skimp on the cheese on the bruschetta. I love cheese so I thought that was great! We also tried the Alfredo Pizza. It was fantastic. I liked it so much that I'm starting to have cravings for it! Only four star instead of five because the cupcake for dessert was just not very good. Which was disappointing since everything else was tasty.

During a Vino and Canvas class you will receive step by step instructions showing you how to paint one of a kind masterpiece AND you really will paint something that looks far better than you could have imagined. Shout-outs go to the teachers and to their talent that somehow magically manages to touch each painting. So paint a picture to hanging up in your house, give one as a gift to a friend or leave the painting randomly somewhere for a stranger to discover making their day significantly better and slightly more confused. (The latter is not what I did with mine. It is proudly displayed in the house). No matter what you decided to do with your artwork, you will definitely have fun painting to your heart's content!

THAT salsa! THOSE tacos! THIS could be a dangerous problem of yummy proportions!   Challenge accepted!   Someone give me a stamp card and lets get started on a beautiful journey covered in the salsa bar's guacamole with a twist of lime. BYT is simple food that is done impeccably well. And it is apparent by the hoards of loyal lunchtime business they do.   THAT insanely large line moves fast and smooth! THOSE employees give beyond friendly with a smile service! THIS needs to be your next lunchtime meal!   Bonus: Taco Tuesdays mean tacos are only $1.49 each!  So grab yourself the biggest horchata I've ever seen, and accept the challenge that will have you hooked on BYT.

I'll be honest, I had absolutely no idea what an acai bowl was up until now. That being said, of course, I had to try Thrive! to find out what it was all about. For anyone else that was confused like me out there, it is basically a smoothie in a bowl. Think a yogurt parfait but with acai sorbet instead since they are dairy, soy, and sugar free. It was very good. I love the tart taste of acai and the fruit that they used was fresh. The staff was patient while I took my time trying to decide what I wanted to order. No line at all on a Monday around noon. I wouldn't go so far to say it is a meal but rather a delicious treat and healthier than other possible options.

I love Salad and Go. This location (the first location ever opened BTW) is right by my work so I go pretty often. The service just gets better and better every time I go. I really enjoy all the salads and smoothies. There isn't a bad one in the bunch. The seasonal options keep every visit interesting. The seasonal strawberry almond with ginger dressing salad is definitely one to try when they have it on the menu. I read the following article a while back about Salad and Go and think it is important to share:  http://saladandgo.com/blog/i-just-want-you-to-know-that-you-saved-my-life/   The article points out exactly why Salad and Go is truly great! I really hope they continue to succeed and hope they can open more and more locations. Thanks Salad and Go for taking such pride in providing a great fast and easy option for good food.

Goodbye Barrelhouse, I will never forget your goat cheese crepes and southern fried artichoke bruschetta. You brought charm to Chandler. We need more restaurants around the area like Barrelhouse so it is sad to see them go. From an unbelievable happy hour, that included a $6 burger that came with fries too, to inviting local artist decor, it was a great place to get a bite to eat and spend a few hours chatting with friends. Their sangria was top notche and they supported local farmers by using fresh ingredient in their dishes. I'm going to miss having this place around.

You should be asking yourself why you have never been to gratifying grains yet because you are missing out. The place is fantastic! The sriracha bread makes the absolute best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The owners could not be nicer and they have completely changed my mind about scones. Hard and disgusting? Never. Soft and delicious? Always. Prices are very reasonable and all the baked goods are fresh. You heard me FRESH! Fresh like baked just minutes before you walk in the door. Some of the items available rotate a bit, usually with what is in season, so like them on Facebook to keep up. Just keep in mind they are only open on Thursdays and Saturdays. So seriously, stop in, get a sample or two and start enjoy some of the amazing treats from GGrains.

This has become a staple on Friday nights with my coworkers. I would say there are usually 5-8 different places to choose from on any given night. I've personally had Satay Hut, Liberty's Biscuits, Paletas Betty, Gigi's cupcakes, and the Gourmet Command Center but SuperFarm SuperTruck, The Chef Genie, The Grilled Cheese Truck, Sandra Dee's Catering and BuzznBee are usually there too. The trucks rotate so I suggest liking the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court on Facebook because they usually post the day before who is planning on being there this week. There are tables and benches but they tend to be full. I've seen people bring their own chairs and blankets to picnic on the grassy area near by during the cooler weather days. Now that it is summer and pretty hot, most trucks offer grab and go which is pretty nice of them and I really respect that there is an effort to continue the food court through the summer. Also, most trucks do take credit cards and there is usually live music too!

Oh, Joyride, I really want to like you but I just can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. I opted to get the the tamales because they come with the house rice and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos. The tamales were just okay, kind of expensive for what you get, and I have to say I really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rice. However, the "white magic" sauce is fantastic. A star for that alone! Maybe other Mexican food places have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal?? I also got the Jamaica...I mean, Hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet. Which was shocking for me because I love sugary sweet things and it was just too much. So much so I didn't even want dessert. I've never said that before. I always want dessert. The house salsa is okay. Not bad but again not great and same goes for the chips. Definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the place. I will say the staff is super friendly and attentive. Maybe too much so. At least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. It made me wonder exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us. Nice but odd. Anyway, I promise to try you one more time for the tacos. Fingers crossed it'll be better.

Joyride, what are you doing? I was just about to update my review to reflect a much more positive experience but you had to go and let me down again.   I'm way happier with your food. Garden Variety Burrito is so delicious with the roasted mushrooms, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and corn combined with avocado, queso and "magic" sauce make the burrito just the right amount of healthy-unhealthy, especially if you get it chime style. I'd highly suggest getting it chime style or enchilada style by adding red/green sauce. And you give unlimited chips -- Yes, please!!  However, amazing food can be over shadowed.  On 5/30/15 in the "Gals" bathroom around 1:30-ish pm, the body of one little Ms. Coc K. Roach was not laid to rest. She was on her back, legs in the air, with no life left for anyone who used the bathroom to see. That's a pretty fast way to make someone lose an appetite. So gross! Check those bathrooms!   The service is finally solid with servers who are knowledgable about the menu and attentive. The food is pretty good but dead bugs in a restaurant, even in a bathroom, is something I would think should be top priority to get under control. They usually say "If there is one bug then there is..."   And as per usual, splitting and getting the check proved to be difficult. Why don't you want to take our money? Please, I really do want to pay for my food and I typically like to do so in a timely fashion.    I hold out hope that one day this review can be sunshine and rainbows but for now it's meh and dead bugs. Sad times, JR.

In the words of those great poets Hall & Oates, "you make my (empanada) dreams come true."  Pretty sure that song was written after partaking in some crispy delicious empanadas. Cue the cartoon animals and backup dancers because Republica Empanada makes my heart flutter into an imaginary musical number complete with jazz hands.  There are so many delicious empanadas to choose from: Pernil (house speciality), El Capitian (ground beef, potato, egg, olive, raisins), Greek (spinach, feta, tomato, olive) and Cubana (pernil, ham, mozzarella, pickle). My favorite has to be, hands down, the Jalapeño Popper, which is now offered in 3 different varieties (ham, potato, and black bean). Just like how the world-altering super food "The Cronut" combined two beloved items: croissants and donuts. Now comes the Empeñopa...Jalapeñada...still working on the name...The Jalapeño Empanada: fulfilling both the craving for jalapeño poppers and empanadas at the same time!  Inside the establishment it can get pretty loud so if the weather is right, you can enjoy lunch outside on the nice shaded patio. Do remember to keep in mind that these pastry babies are freshly deep fried when you order them so they are HOT! I repeat: H-O-T! Too HOT to handle. So while it might be extremely tempting, please do not bite right into to them or risk loosing you taste buds for a period of time.  The service is always spectacular and the lunch special is a great value: two empanadas, rice, beans, and a cabbage salad for $7.95! Save room for some Papas Fritas (fresh cut fries with house seasoning). Those savory, golden tan, potato-y goodness treats are dangerously addicting. You'll get them to share amongst you and your friends but quickly regret not getting a basket all for your very own.    Republica Empanada, I know I (my stomach) will never be the same now that I have met you!

What a wonderful store!   Organized, clean, and amazing finds. (I'm looking at you, croaking Christmas frogs and homemade Santa hat.) The staff is fantastic and so helpful. They let me know that the store would be closing soon for the day but I could take my time while still looking around. Then after my purchase, they even helped me out to my car! I can't remember the last time, if ever, I have been helped to my car.   Mondays are senior days and, I believe, Saturdays are military and student days. The best part is that all the amazing finds you purchase go to a great cause, Hospice of the Valley. That makes me feel wonderful knowing that the proceeds go to a group that gives so much.

Yogurtland is cool - pun intended.   There are fun, rotating, and often new flavors throughout the year. The new flavors usually coincide with a theme which is sometimes linked to awesome collector spoons! If you get a chance, try looking up all the different spoons that they've featured in the past. They are nifty and worth checking out if you've got the free time. I remember the Tokidoki ones -- ridiculously adorbs! They've previously had Looney Tunes spoons and I believe they currently have Candy Crush inspired ones this summer.   There is water infused with fruit available in case you might be a little thirsty from all the lever pulling and topping scooping that you did filling your cup up. The Yogurtland App is rather helpful. You can use it to checkout what flavors are part of today's lineup, earn points, and get discounts.   This location is on the smaller side and therefore bit awkwardly shaped. When it get's busy, the store can get a little claustrophobic up in there. It lacks a good crowd control flow that some of the other Yogurtland locations seem to have to manage larger groups of customers.   All the employees I've encountered at this location are friendly, minus the person I assume was the manager a few years ago - I shall call him Mr. Grump-O. However, one time I received an extra collector spoon at this location! Shhh, don't tell! I'm not sure if they are allowed to do that but it was AWESOME!

I think it might be puppy love!   The fried green tomato stack is the kind of dish I'll start to crave. There are enough elements like corn, avocado, and tomato that I can convince myself that it is healthy even though I'm eating something deep fried with bacon and a blue cheese dressing.   Holy crap, I just don't care!   I'll spend my days dreaming about you until we can meet once more. The atmosphere is inviting and clean and don't forget to check out the wall of furry friends that's by the bathrooms before you leave.

Yum yum. Soft, fluffy, delicious donuts that are sooooooooo GOOD! Their glazed ones can almost compete with Krispy Kreme's. The staff is friendly and polite. My only slight disappointments are that I wish they carried more flavors of donuts, different glazes and what not, and I wish they didn't use the prepackaged deli meats their croissants(it's very obvious). So yes, Good Donuts is good but if they fixed a few small little things they could be great!

So much fun!! I had never tried Zumba before so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect.  We tried the Zumba Lite class. Thinking that was a good place to start, right? If that's the "lite" class, what is the advanced class like?   You most certainly will break a sweat while dancing this funky hybrid version of latin dance and...twerking? Yup, expect to do a little bit of that as well. The instructors are very energetic and welcoming. In fact, everyone we spoke with was super friendly. Towels are provided and plenty of water is available if you need it. Once you have made it through shaking your stuff there is a nice cool down stretch at the end of the class.   If you have never tried Zumba, I suggest starting with the Zumba Starts Here class which teaches the basics, breaking down moves and repeats them so when you do start to learn routines for the more advanced classes, you have a better idea of what you are doing.   The studio also offers cardio and toning classes and they just started offering hip hop classes as well. Prices are very reasonable. We went and the drop in rate was $5 for the one class. Plus, I got a pass to come back and get my second class for free!!  Dance is suppose to help reduce stress, increase happiness and help your immune system become stronger. Just some of the great reasons to give Zumba a try!

Echoing Other Reviewers: This place is GREAT!   I had a 10 minute wait because of a couple of other people in front of me but overall I was out in 20 mins!  You are asked a few standard questions and then you are asked to hand sanitize before they start the "printing". Nice, nice. Keeping it clean. That is much appreciated!   I didn't catch the name of the nice gentleman that assisted me but he was delightful. We had a nice conversation about how important it is to moisturize especially in the heat. Awe, crap looks like he knows I don't stay hydrated. Whoops! Funny how people can tell so much about you from something you take for granted like those silly whirls and ridges on your fingers.   With such a pleasant experience, I'd get fingerprint daily if I had too! Why can't the DMV be this nice?

Went back to try Happy Hour at O'Brien's and holy crap, those plates were huge and delicious! If you get a chance stop by for their happy hour it is well worth it. Staff is still green but noticeably getting better. It was just as cold in the restaurant as is was outside, fine once you start eating and drinking though. Perhaps a few degrees warmer would have been nice. A couple next to us was complaining about the cold too. Shouldn't need a jacket inside a building. Definitely, will be back to try more!

I agree with other reviewers that this location is more of an "upscale" environment than other pita jungle locations. It is definitely beautiful and I would really like to eat in their outside area someday soon. Both times I have been to this location were for takeout so I can't speak much for the wait staff but the people running the takeout door, yeah a whole separate door for takeout -  a really nice touch, have been pleasant and helpful. The last time I ordered I went I ordered an iced chai tea to go. My to-go cup was much smaller at this location than I have had in the past at other locations. Hope that isn't how it is going to be from now on because I will probably stop ordering them. Also, I asked for almond milk. Just soy or cow milk. That's a bit of a bummer. But the food was good as always!

My favorite Dutch Bros. The staff is friendly and their smiles actually seem genuine. That's the whole point of the friendliness of Dutch Bros, right? To help you have a better day and want to come back and get more  and more caffeinated. It probably doesn't hurt that this is a newer location. I'm not a fan of how the drive thru is setup but that's easily forgiven by the super cool building design and set up at this particular location.

This establishment should be a candidate for one of those reality TV restaurant makeover shows. Bar Rescue, Restaurant: Impossible, Kitchen Nightmares...somebody (anybody?) help Margaritas out, please!  Chef Gordon Ramsay would scare the living daylight out of the whole staff and fix the menu, Jon Taffer would bring in a mixology to help craft some much needed new and tasty cocktails, and Chef Robert Irvine would bootcamp the decor and management into shape.  Margarita's website boasts: "Enjoy outstanding service and authentic Mexican food".   Whelp! Those are certainly some BIG shoes to fill even at an outstanding restaurant. Unfortunately, for Margaritas, that statement is in a galaxy far, far away from reality.   The food here was okay...my gosh, that is being nice. I am one to ALWAYS finish my food and if I don't, then I ask for a to-go box. Not the case this time. The food was just not good. It was a very strange feeling leaving unsatisfied and empty handed.  There were a few events happening at Mesa Arts Center that evening so it was a busy night and the place was packed-in like sardines. The wait-staff simply could not handle the amount of customers.   We received no water or chip refills and all the servers seemed super overwhelmed running inside and outside of the restaurant trying to juggle the customers. Honestly, we only tipped because we felt so bad for our waitress, but the tip wasn't really deserved based on the experience we had here. Redistributing server areas might help or maybe management could step up and help instead of standing around talking (hint-hint).   Lastly, I have no idea what the issue was but it took well over 30 minutes for us to get our check after our food was cleared. That was just ridiculous. That could have be an open table to seat new customers who had been waiting. Also, once we received the check, they couldn't figure out how to split it. Nothing fancy just down the middle. SMH.  Margaritas would be my last pick for Mexican food in the downtown Mesa area. A more accurate statement for their website would be "enjoy barely passable service and mediocre food". Overhaul this place, please! Or just put this place out of it's misery and turn it into a nice wine bar instead!

The Sweet Tooth Fairy is franchised chain located primarily in Utah, that has been featured on Rachel Ray and won Cupcake Wars. Arizona used to have two locations but now only the Gilbert store remains.  Our first visit to this location they were rather bare on treats for a Friday night and had no Strawberry Shortcake cupcake???! I was devastated.  However, this most recent trip (on a Tuesday afternoon) the cases were full of eye-widening goodies! I enjoyed a Blueberry Lemon cupcake that was jaw-droppingly ('cause I was busy stuffing my face) good! The blueberry cake was moist and filled with a lovely lemon curd topped with a refreshing lemon frosting that was delicious.   The to-go containers are all plastic and not nearly as charming as the actual store itself but are perfect size for a single cupcake.  Both times we visited, the service from the all-star friendly employees was fantastic!   Also, on your first time at the store, you are given samples, too! How sweet! However, I'm not particularly fond of cake bites and found theirs to be overly sweet (Yeah, I said it). So I'd say pass on those and go straight for the cupcakes and some milk, which they have "on tap".   And before you leave don't forget to signup for their birthday club so you can receive a free cupcake on your special day!

Delicious! This place certainly knows how to make a tasty sandwich. The bread is soft but crunchy and didn't get soggy! That's a big deal for me. Nobody likes the gross soggy party at the end...looking at you Subway. Not to mention they use fresh veggies and delicious sauces. Lets not forget the awesome jalapeño poppers that you can get in your sandwich was well! Also, I'm super impressed with the fact that there are so many different sandwich options and they have many vegetarian and vegan choices.These sandwiches are huge as expected for the prices! Almost wish they had a smaller size option as well. Oh well, just save some for later!

My favorite Dollar Tree in this area because service here is always friendly. Even when I needed to do an exchange on some items. They had no issue and did the swap with a smile. Don't know how the staff seems to stay so happy but somehow they manage to do so and it is appreciated. There is usually a good size section of festive holiday items up front that rotates out depending on the time of year -- Easter, Valentines, St. Patty's, Thanksgiving, or Christmas. Tons of stuff that would cost more at other stores can be found here for just a buck. Things such as frames, mirrors, party decorations, greeting cards, gift bags = $1!

Tucked away a little off Mill, this is one of the only Ike's that serves breakfast and let's not forget they have a dessert sandwiches too! With tons of vegetarian and vegan options (they have fried chicken as well if that is more your type of thing) there is a sandwich here to please any and everyone. The sandwiches are huge! Any of the ones priced over $12.00 are intended to be shared or can easily feed one very hungry person. (BTW: French is my bread of choice and don't forget the dirty sauce.) Also, they have a rotating sandwich of the week since Ike's has over 500+ options between all of their locations. Do your hungry tummy a favor and stop here soon.

Can't beat their Happy Hour on Wednesdays from 4:00 - 5:00 pm and on Saturdays from 1:00 - 2:00 pm, where their cupcakes are only $1.00. No need to check your glasses. That's right - I wrote $1.00.   $1.00!  Their cupcakes are good. The cake is light and fluffy. I am a pretty big fan of cupcakes being soft heavenly pillows in your mouth so these do delight. The frostings are gosh darn tasty too.   By far the best cupcake on the menu is their TRIPLE CHOCOLATE. It was deemed the clear winner by my office coworkers. It is chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, and chocolate sprinkles. A triple threat of chocolate goodness. I'm now on request (required) to bring much more of them to work next time.  My personal favorite was the almond raspberry one I had a while back. The filling really made it something unique and special. Plus, I'm a sucker for edible glitter in frosting! I'm glad Sugarlips is close to where I live to fulfill all my spur of the moment, spontaneous, cupcake needs.

The food was absolutely fabulous! I had the chicken entree. It's just slightly priced over what I really would want to pay for the size of a dish but the chicken was extremely flavorful and juicy so that makes it completely worth it. I really enjoyed the yogurt cucumber dip but I can see how someone might not. It's pretty heavy on the dill so if you don't like that favor stay away from it.   The restaurant is set up a little odd. Apparently, it is table service but reads much more like counter service at a fast food place. Mainly, because there is a menu billboard above the counter which is in the center of the restaurant instead of the entrance.   The cashier/waitress who was there when I stopped by definitely tries super hard to "sweet" talk customers for tips. It can be a bit much. Personally, I prefer a much more sincere and tailored to each customer approach for tips instead nice, repetitive, robot but whatever works.    There isn't much atmosphere to the restaurant so I'll definitely be back but for take out and not dine in in the future.

You had me at "Yo" and it only got better with "Waffle"! There is no denying frozen yogurt is great and waffles are amazing, but when you put the two together they become a match made in dessert heaven.   Yo Waffles features the Liège kind of waffles, which are basically brioche dough that has been coated with sugar to create crispy, caramelized, buttery, scrumptious, delight. Hot off the iron these lovelies are richer, denser, sweeter, and crispier than an average waffle. Yum! They even have gluten free waffles now, too!  Enjoy 14 different flavors of frozen yogurt daily, of which there is sure to be at least two dairy-free sorbets. You can't never go wrong with a flavor like Triple Chocolate (so much chocolate in just one spot!) or for something straight out of summer, treat yourself to Valencia Orange swirled with it's best buddy Vanilla and you've got a Creamsicle in your cup...or on your waffle.   There are a ton of different toppings to choose from such as fruits, nuts, candy pieces, boba, Biscoff, Nutella, cereals like fruity pebbles, brownie bites or cheesecake pieces, and even freshly cut bananas if you request it! Oh, and don't forget the whipped cream on top!   The ultra friendly staff leaves you all smiles and yo' wanting more!

What you need to know is: They have phenomenal prices, delicious tacos, and HUGE quesadillas -- Bigger than your face size! There is always enough food to eat now and plenty to save for later. They are quick, fast, and friendly. Driving can kind of be a mess around downtown Gilbert, especially on Friday nights. Be sure to keep an eye out, the turn in to the resturant can easily be missed.

Really a 3.5 but we can round up for the delicious drinks and a shorter wait time than the rest of downtown Gilbert! Each of the opportunities I have had to dine at Zinburger the wait time was 10-15 mins. This has always been significantly shorter than the 1hour+ wait times at other various downtown Gilbert joints.   The drinks I have had the pleasure of sampling at Zin are the kind that you could keep going back for seconds... or perhaps, thirds... maybe, fours... oh dear... and not even realize how smashed you are getting because they are just so tasty you would like another and another...    Their veggie burger is solid. Not my all time favorite. The patty has a good flavor but it tends to break apart more than I prefer for a veggie burger but that is one of the more difficult issues to fix. It nice that they have that option available for people that don't eat meat or beef.   The fries and shakes are definitely where Zinburger shines. You can't go wrong with any of the fries options -- loaded, green chili, double truffle. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Oh, and, their shakes mean business! They are rich, thick and decadent. I tried the Banana Royale and it was a banana split in a glass - whip cream and cherry on top included!!   FYI: You can get the shakes to go (in case you were wondering).   This location also serves brunch on Saturdays and Sunday from 10:00am-1:00pm. I highly recommend checking it out by grabbing a breakfast menu bloody mary on the patio in some nice weather.

Total Wine & More (so-so-soooo much more!) is a magical place where fairies, gnomes, elves (in the off season), dragons and other random Middle-earth creatures assist you in your journey towards intoxication. That might be the sample station talking and those fairies, trolls, wombats, etc, might just be the friendly and helpful employees...but I triple dare ya to prove me wrong.   Most of my enthralling adventures to this particular location have involved a search scouring through the endless aisles of their fantastic selection only to arrive at the "legen...wait for it...dary" single bottle drink passageway.   Banana Bread Beer?   Sure, why not.   Pineapple Cider?  FTW! Totally what I came here for in the first place!   Sticky Toffee Pudding Ale?   Whoa, buddy. Stop the whirligig of fun! These flavors are out of control!   What's next?   Cinnamon Roll Stout (there is one) or Flaming Hot Cheetos IPA? I'm calling it now - - Give it a year.

Delicious! I've been to other places that use liquid nitrogen but sometimes the ice cream can turn out too cold and ice crystals form leaving the consistency a little less desirable. That's not the case at ICream! They certainly know what they are doing and whatever you decide to order the end result is a creamy and smooth treat!  There are tons of flavors to choose from like classics such as vanilla and chocolate to the more adventurous flavors like green tea or curry. Also, you have the option to pick an organic base or non-dairy base and various different bases in-between (fro-yo or sorbet anyone?).   ICream gets an extra star because someone could totally snap a finger off if it got stuck in the nitrogen! I know they are well trained to make sure this does not happen but seriously... so the extra element of danger and suspense makes that much more exciting to watch.   Right now there are only 3 ICream locations in the United States and we are lucky to have one in AZ. So if you are looking for a fun and unique dessert, definitely give them a try!

I was super excited to try the new donut shop, Darling Donuts. I saw that for opening week they were giving out a free donut. Free food, I'm totally in! Sadly, it was not a great experience. Granted it is probably my fault for going in the evening after I got out of work, but the place was deserted aside from the one lonely, clearly bored, employee. The donuts definitely did not look fresh anymore. The glaze on top of them was cracking, a the tell-tale signs of sitting out too long, but the guilt of walking out with nothing from a new and empty business convinced me to continue on anyway.  It was incredibly difficult to order for the sound from the TV was so ridiculously loud. Add that to the fact I am pretty short and so was the employee, we had to try to talk through the donut case since neither of us were tall enough to talk over it. (I definitely do not appreciate the height of their donut display counters.) Lastly, the one lone employee did not seem to know how to work the register very well so she asked to ring my card again because a receipt didn't print out. Sure enough, when I checked my bank account, I was charged twice. Not cool.   When I finally tried the donuts that night at home, they seemed a bit stale as predicted. When they are fresh, they probably taste much much better but I can only say they were average at best and that is being nice. They are a decent size and priced alright but overall the whole experience was pretty darn disappointing, darlings.

The cheddar mac n' cheese bites have blown my mind. If I had any part of my brain left, I would most certainly use it to let you know how much I enjoyed the food from Stufrageous Stuffed Burgers. The outrageous sauce is phenomenal. It is tangy, sweet, with a little spicy kick and goes smashingly with the tempura green beans, which are a nice alternative to typical fries. Don't worry, they have the staple French Fries too. Along with delicious Sweet Potato Fries as well!   I had a chicken burger stuffed Capresse style. The flavor was on point between the tomato, basil and mozzarella. Next, I tired the Hawaiian. It has a whole pineapple slice stuffed inside that added a scrumptious juicy flavor to the burger. Also, I super appreciate the fact that they have a not forgotten to have a veggie burger and it is equally as tasty.   Note: The Veggie Burger is not stuffed. I would suggest adding cheese on to it if you are not vegan.   The customer service was wonderful. The staff was so friendly, help, informative, and delightful. The establishment is clean and inviting and the lighting is certainly fun. With an open kitchen you get to watch as your food is made right before you. Thus, giving your extra confidence in the the quality of the product you receive.   I look forward to my next visit. Mac n' Cheese stuffed burger you are all mine!

The pineapple pancakes were fluffy and the bacon was crisp. Early (early early - like when they first open) morning wait time was only 15 mins and had food ordered and out to us in 20 mins. We have tried other times and have been told an 1hr and 45min wait time. Yikes! I've had the fried green tomatoes (to-go) and they were absolutely phenomenal. I was super impressed with them. I highly suggest trying the togo window if you are looking for fast service. Otherwise, plan on having a wait.

Super new location. Therefore, it is big, nice, and clean. We went late on a Wednesday and the store was practically empty. There were barely any customers to be seen. I imagine this is typically the case during weekday nights. The staff was friendly. This location has loads of ribbons and ribbons. So if you need ribbons of all kinds, small, large, pre-made, in all shades and colors, this is the spot for you. They also have tons of frames and flowers. Loads of canvas as well but I couldn't find any circular ones, which is what I was searching for at the time. It was a little difficult to find what I needed. I feel like the location was better before it moved but the parking is million times better so that's a huge plus. The new store appears to be set up great for crafting events with multiple meeting rooms in the front of the store! I look forward to them offering a bunch of different options to explore!

Boy, has the Gilbert Food Truck Food Court grown! Long gone is the original location (a parking lot that was replaced by the delightful Zinburger, Lolo's and soon Pomo Pizzeria Napolentana). They out grew the small lot across the street from Oregano's. The weekly meeting of food trucks and vendors is so massive now that it is currently in a huge dirt lot (it was rocky so wearing sneakers is highly recommended over flip flips - you will thank me later) across from Barrio Queen, right next to the canal (if you are a bike rider, you'll love it).   There is live music, at least 10 different food trucks, beautiful sunsets and still never enough chairs or tables. I suggest you just bring your own chairs to avoid that problem or take your food to-go. Trucks like the Superfarm Superfood, Bang Bang Dumpling and at least one BBQ truck are always there.   Trucks do vary from week to week but you can check the who is on the weekly rotation on their fb page. I've had everything from The Maine Lobster Lady (crazy longline everytime so you know they are doing something right) to Waffle Love (also, one of the longer lines but they have a stamp card!) to SugarHi, a booth that sells interesting flavored cotton candy!   So instead of paying a cover fee to go to some food truck festival, just head on out to downtown Gilbert because there is a food truck party every Friday night.

Who needs morning self affirmations in the mirror when you can just go to D.Bros for coffee?! It is a 3 compliment minimum day, everyday!! The staff is your own personal fan club complete with coffee!  Easily one of my favorite Dutch Bros locations because of the wonderful employees but one of my least favorite locations because of that darn line. Can I ever be here with less than 5 people in front of me? Oh, well.  Way to help me figure out how to get more liquid gold into a smaller cup. Cold pour = no ice. And topped it off. You rock, D.Bros! We can forget about that blasted long line for now. And no, my 2001 car is not vintage yet, but thank you for trying to make my car feel special too!

Be transported back in time to an era of ice cream parlors and soda fountain shops when you step foot inside Petersen's Ice Cream Cafe.  You'll be greeted by the cafe's cute pastel interior and the friendly employees dressed in true soda jerk fashion: white apron and rectangular hat.   Treat yourself to a single scoop, sundae, milkshake, float or banana split. Ice cream flavors include: rocky road, praline, mint chocolate chip, cookie dough, pistachio and strawberry. Super fans of vanilla will be beside themselves with delight as this spot offers three different kinds: classic vanilla, vanilla chocolate chip, and vanilla bean.   The ice cream is standard but solid. Which isn't a bad thing, but I typically prefer a few more imaginative options. However, they do offer some fun flavors like cinnamon (I like to pretend it is horchata) and Superman (three flavors in shades of blue, red, and yellow -- like the Man of Steel's uniform).  This place might be more about the adorable atmosphere, friendly service, and the fact that you are in downtown Gilbert and are craving a frozen treat, than it is about having a mind-blowing dessert.   In some places when the weather gets colder, ice cream parlors close down during the those months. Luckily for us Zonies, we will never have to worry about being without our frozen treats!

Chon Thai Food brings a smile to my face. Yup, that's right, I'm jumping on the Yelp bandwagon and singing the praises for this wonderful restaurant! They have an amazing lunch special, spectacular employees, stunning presentations, delicious food and ridiculously outstanding prices!! Plus, their mango and sweet sticky rice is out-of-this-world good! It is a must when you visit. All the 5 star reviews are very well deserved.

Live every day like it is Taco Tuesday.   Important words to take to heart so seeking out an epic day of tacos, I ventured off to Taco Shack. The shack was not busy at all when I arrived. Just two people sitting in the corner chatting about business. This visit was late on Tuesday afternoon around four-ish. From ordering to receiving my food, I was in & out within 10 minutes. That's some speedy service!  Sadly, no salsa bar but your food does come with red & green salsas. Both were too hot for my enjoyment. However, I'm sure some people would like the heat.   The Chicken Tinga taco was Ah-MAZ-YUM!! Topped with tomatoes, cheese, and a cream sauce. Those tacos merit 5 stars alone! I could eat a whole plate of them. Seriously. Give me a taco platter with those on it, please!    The current Yelp check-in offer is for a free churro. I had no issue redeeming this offer. The churro was very tasty despite being fairly light in color - not doughy at all and cooked throughout.   I tried the vegan Anarcho Kale taco. I was not a fan. This might be because I'm only "sometimes a vegetarian" but I also wasn't thrilled at the fact that it seemed to have pieces of chopped up french fries in it. Fresh grilled veggies would be preferred. The avocado appeared to be too rip and yet had brown spots so that was disappointing as well. I'd say pass on this one, fo' sure.   Sadly, they had no Agua Frescas available to try when I went. Would have loved to sample their horchata. I guess this means another visit  for some Chicken Tinga tacos might be in my near future!

Norman Bates: We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you? Marion Crane: Yes. Sometimes just one time can be enough.  Oh the insanity! But one time is not enough for MAD Greens!  M.Greens features salads with fun names like Doc Holliday, Edgar Allen Poe, and Don Quixote. Just to name a few. The salads are full of BIG flavor and mouthwatering fresh ingredients.   I've also had a lot of success building my own salad. You select your lettuce (choose up to 3 between options romaine, mixed greens, spinach, and kale), your protein (meat and vegetarian options too), up to 4 other ingredients (cheeses, nuts, fruits, and veggies) and your dressing (20+ options). If salads aren't really your thing then you are in the wrong place. Jk. They also have wraps, pannis, juices, soups, hummus AND dessert (Salted Caramel Cookie and 7 Layer Bar!!)!  My only small bump was that the staff seemed a little confused. One employee didn't know the difference between the roasted red peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. Also they were unsure of what cheese is which... Hopefully, that was just a fluke because basic knowledge of what you serve should be should be in training... I would suggest being an informed consumer, know what you are ordering and double check your items when you get them.  To quench your thirst they have Maine Root Fountain Soda, Fresh Brewed Tea (herbal hibiscus, passon fruit mango, white pear (I can't decide!!) and bottled 3rd Street Teas! Yum, yum, YUM!    Mad Greens, I'm a little crazy for you!

This is the first Your Pie location in the Valley (their headquarters is in Athens, GA). They are speedy, friendly, and causal! When we arrived there was hardly a line so we took our sweet time before stepping right up to the counter to order our build-your-own-pizza. The customizable ingredients (40+ toppings) are fresh and our pizzas came out of the brick oven to the table fast!   I got a modified version of The Nat (basil pesto, mozzarella, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, chicken) and my friend ordered a modified version of BBQ Chicken (BBQ sauce, mozzarella, chicken, cilantro, red onions). We were both happy with our selections. The pizzas were full of flavor and cooked thoroughly, but not overly crispy. The hospitable employees even ask if we would like any sauces to dip our crust and gave us a gracious amount for dipping. THX!!  Other items being served up are chopped salads, paninis, and craft beers (looks like 6 taps at this location - including local favorite - Four Peaks). The whole group can eat here no matter what their dietary needs might be because they have gluten-free dough and vegan cheese.   My only really qualm is that the west side of the building needs blinds or something for the afternoon. It was just too bright! We almost wore sunglasses inside and that kind of ruins the experience a little but...  They have a small case of GELATO!!  And that fixes all. The employee that gave me my scoop of delicious White Chocolate Strawberry informed me that Your Pie is big on locally sourced food/ingredients. This location serves Lombardo's gelato, a local company and flavors will vary based on what is available. Pretty cool stuff (Pun intended)!

Holy Shiitake, these mushrooms are superb!   The Mellow Mushroom fun-loving hippies began serving pizza and cold beer in the 1970s and now have over 180 locations in 21 states.   This brand new Mesa location has only been open since May 2. Barely over a week, not even two weeks, so with that in mind there will be definitely a few kinks to work out, but I had a really pleasant experience on this first visit.  We were told the wait would be 5 minutes when we arrived and it was just slightly under that time. The interior is very interesting, filled with tons of artwork and lighting to look at while waiting. The elephant by the front door and the owl watching over the interior of the establishment are some highlights.    Our server seems super concerned about our timeline (if we needed to get to a movie or anything). This is certainly appreciated since AMC is in the same shopping complex.   Also, our server let us know Happy Hour (M-F from 3pm-6pm and reverse HH, every day 10:30PM til 2AM -- open until 2AM, Heck YEAH! Late night post-movie food!) was coming to a close soon so we could still get HH price on apps and drinks if we put in our order before then. A very cool move on his part. We tried the Stuffed Mushroom (one portobello mushroom cap filled with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella. Topped with a drizzled of balsamic glaze on a bed of  greens).  It was very tasty. The server offered up this tip: he often orders the Stuffed Mushroom and makes it into a burger. Something fun to try in the future!  MM offers a lot of options with a ton of unique and interesting flavors of pizza (they also have calzones and burgers too). Some flavors include: Maui Wowie, Funky Q. Chicken, Rib Eye Pie, and Loaded Potato. Our server pointed out the local favorites section (worth a look) that offers flavors not seen at other locations such as Egg & Pancetta (olive oil/garlic base pizza, sunny side up eggs and pancetta), Melchacho (spicy chipotle red sauce base, cheese, chorizo, red onion, tomato, avocado and fresh cilantro), and The Caesar! (you get a salad on top).  They offer vegan and gluten-free pizzas for anyone that has special dietary needs, too!  Seeing that we had mushroom (much room) for more food. We ordered two small size pizza pies to try. One of the local favorites: Fun Guy (5 types of mushrooms! on top of mozzarella cheese and house made grilled mushroom vinaigrette) and Thai Dye (Olive oil and garlic base, curry chicken, mozzarella, roma tomatoes, onions, fresh basil, cucumbers and a sweet swirl of Thai chili sauce). Both were so good, it was difficult to pick a favorite.   Their pizza is great! A mostly thin crust, but with a nice, thick, doughy pillow of a crust on the outside edge. YUM!!!  Plenty of food to share and have leftovers to take home for later. While it might take a little bit longer, Mellow's pie beats out some of the faster, build-it-your-way, pizza places that have popped up all around recently and I'll definitely be back to MM soon for more!
