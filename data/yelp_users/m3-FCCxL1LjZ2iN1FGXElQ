I visit this spot for the Happy Hour.   3-7pm.    The Viva Las Vegas Roll is pretty delicious & fancy if made right.  Sometimes, I've had it look like a disaster during Happy Hour.  Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.  The music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.  Even during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.  All in all, mehh... if you're really hard up for somewhere to go, it's an experience.

A sweet little dive bar.  I was unsure at first... where's the entrance?  Why is it so dirty in here?  Glorious.  Walking distance from a friend's house.  Seriously cheappp... I ate & drank very well for less than fifteen dollars.  Happy Saturday night.  The wings are great... must try.  Wasn't a fan of the vodka soda but that's what I get for doing well.  The headache was brutal.  I'll be back!

I feel like I'm on some sort of adventure whenever I visit Lee Lee's.  Upon entering, you're hit with some sort of curry-like aroma that is super off-putting.  That smell.  Just barrel through.  Your sense of smell will adjust as time passes.  Woof.  I love shopping for veggies & fruits here.  They have everything your little cold heart could desire.  I'm a big fan of plantains & they always have them... green just the way they are meant to be!  My Puerto Rican heritage thanks you, Lee Lee's.  You probably won't be able to read 95% of the packages because they are in a different language.  Into my shopping cart you go!  Be adventurous!  Try all of the things!  The aisles are thoughtfully divided into regions so you have somewhat of an idea of what you're getting yourself into.  The Japanese aisles are my favorite.  Seaweed everywhere!!!    The beer selection is awesome.  It's your one stop shop for anything ethnic.  Oh, you need something from your culture?  Lee Lee's has it.

I just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.  SO NICE.  The orange chicken is delicious.  We're also a big fan of the teriyaki... portion sizes are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.  The sauce is great though.  The decor is plain but I think they're trying to update it a bit... the location is a little sketchy.  But the food definitely makes up for it.  Definitely a Chandler must.

This place always completes my Thai craving.  I'm not a Thai expert & I'm not going to pretend to be... I can pronounce anything on their menu.  but I absolutely love Pad Thai.  Swaddee Thai is a little pricey for me... yikes... (then again, I am a seriously broke college student & a barista so I'm sure if you're a normal professional human, you'll be just fine)... their lunch specials are awesome.  Whenever I go, it is always empty!!!  Usually not a great sign... but I think I just get cravings at weird times.  HAH.  Always order a Thai Iced Tea... because it is some sort of sugar coma inducing tradition.  Delicious.  But to the main reason I'm writing this review!!!  PAD THAI.  The shrimp are always plump... the noodles are always just right... the seasoning is exactly what I want and need out of my Pad Thai dish.  The bean sprouts are crunchy and wonderful.  I'm a wimp & I get zero to none spicy because I can't take it otherwise & it's usually still spicy?  I think they do that just to spite me.  I've had their pineapple fried rice before which I would describe as... Meeeh.  Take it or leave it.  I think I found two and a half chunks of pineapple within the rice.  They always treat you well here... keep your glasses full... I love it.

i love liberty market.  i do not love lines but i will gladly stand in one for one of their fantastic desserts.  they have an amazing red velvet cake & cheesecake in a jar.  YUMM.  quality.    the decor is modern.  the kind of restaurant that you wish your house looked like if you were a little hipster baby.  does that make sense?  four stars because it can get super packed & the wait takes soo long.  or it feels like a long time.  sometimes it's discouraging enough to give up all together & seek refuge at postinos or dare i say it... oreganos.  still.  i love this little spot & i definitely recommend it.

Mikado is my absolute hands down favorite sushi bar in Arizona.  It's not just the food, but the atmosphere... it's really laid back & you feel right at home.  My favorite of favorites... Albacore Onion Sashimi with added crunchy garlic.  Super fresh albacore tuna wrapped around onion soaked in ponzu sauce & deep fried garlic cloves.  It has the most amazing flavor & very generous portions.  & if they have it, ask for Tuna Tataki. It's ahi tuna perfection... we get it every single time.  I've never gone wrong here... but we tend to stick with the sushi.  Their lunch specials are awesome.  =)

Still the best.  I stopped by on a Friday during the end of happy hour.  It was super busy.  Like there wasn't an open table.  My little hole in the wall secret is out!    Tuna tataki went up in price & I feel like the portion size became smaller... which is sad.  I miss the days when they were generous.   All in all, still gets 5 stars from me.  I've been getting the Spicy Sashimi salad which has a huge portion of sashimi over mixed greens in a spicy sauce.  Soo good.

i'm so sad!  this used to be my favorite place in Chandler.  Like... visit once a week, tell all of my friends, dream about eating here favorite place.  I think success might have gotten to their head but they are no longer the sweet little hole in the wall secret sushi place i knew them once to be with the amazing customer service and great food.  i recently went for happy hour with my mom... let's be honest, their happy hour was never that amazing but it was decent.  enough to make the excuse to come in.  we order... which takes a while, despite there being only being three other tables.  we were ignored for a while.  not a deal breaker.  i get that you might be busy or new.  everyone seemed to be a new face so i let it slide.    every visit, my mom orders the same thing... tuna tataki -- not super spicy. it's her favorite thing on the menu & we've been ordering it for at least two years that way. we were told by three different people that wasn't possible.  tuna tataki is naturally spicy so there isn't any way to make it not so spicy.  they finally cave & tell us they'll do it for us this time... when she gets it, it's still pretty spicy & she can't eat it.    i ordered scallop nigiri.  the sushi chef asked if i wanted spicy scallop which should have been my first clue... nope.  just regular please.  the thing was drenched in lemon juice but that couldn't hide the intense fishy smell.  i know scallops are hit or miss in arizona but i could always look forward to coming to mikado & getting something fresh... i guess i just trusted them more not to serve that.  i was wrong.  i ordered the albacore onion sashimi also & was completely baffled by the texture of the fish.  it was mushy & fishy tasting... despite the ponzu & onion to cover up the taste.  i couldn't finish it.  we didn't receive our salads.  waters weren't refilled.  it was the worst experience i've had at mikado & after an intense decline in customer service and food quality, i've decided to retire it from my favorite places in phoenix.  :(  it's sad but i'd rather spend my money elsewhere.

This location is great!  We sat out on the patio since the wait for inside was almost an hour.  YIKES.  It was a good choice though... a little hot but the misters kept us cool.    Love the drinks.  The Koolaid is great!!!  This time... I opted for an unsweetened tea with a splash of lemonade... delicious.  The service here is divine.  Seriously.  Everything you could want out of a waitstaff... attentive, friendly & always smiling.  It seems like a great place to work and that really shows.  I had the Betty Boop... consisting of a waffle & a chicken breast.  I'll just eat half, I told myself... and skip the syrup.  NOPE.  I drenched my waffle & chicken with syrup, inhaled the waffle & practically licked my plate clean.  No regrets.  Everyone gets a cheat day, right?  I'll be back, Lo-Lo's.  :)

Chase Field is home during the baseball season.  The Diamondbacks really know how to take care of their fans... admission is inexpensive & there isn't a bad seat in the house.  I've had seats behind home plate and way up at the very top of the upper level.  Either way, it's a great way to beat the heat in the summer thanks to the retractable roof.    My favorite place to sit is the left field bleachers.  It's a great fan experience if you're into that.  You can even look into the bullpen & watch the pitchers warm up.  Make sure to get there early for batting practice.  Great opportunity to catch baseballs. :)  Don't miss the Leinenkugel beer stand near left field.  Ask them to mix you a Honey Bear.  Half Berry Weiss, Half Honey Weiss.  It's delicious.  Find a Macayo's & order their nachos... a little pricey but they use a white cheese, beer & chicken...  & load them up!  Usually feeds a group of us.  Well worth it.  I'm obsessed with this field.  You should be too.

I was super unsure of this place.  The IP was really under construction at the time... it made me pretty nervous walking through.  & it took me a while to find this place... but wow.  When we did find it, diamond in the rough.  We dropped in for a breakfast/brunch after a crazy night.  Lots of kids and families.  Loud.  Luckily, there wasn't too much of a wait.  We were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting.  Great service, the waiter was super attentive.  I love a bloody mary & this was one of the best that I've had.  Just the right amount of spice to clear up the massive hangover.  Their juices are great... freshly made, or so I was told.  I had the sage chicken... it was insane.  Huge dish.  Perfectly crispy & the sage was intense but surprisingly good.  I can't wait to go back.

This place is NOT okay for me... I have gained serious pounds eating here.  I am that person that stakes out the sushi bar and crab legs like a fiend.  Yeah, I'm that girl.  The sushi is okay for a buffet, but the sashimi is awesome.  Really.  And the crab legs are always really good, if you can get there before the hoarders move in.  I avoid the fried foods and typical buffet fare just so I can fill up on the good stuff. :)  But there is definitely something for everyone here.  Go for lunch!  Dinner is expensive and that makes me sad.

Feeling like breakfast on a farm? This is the place.  The scenery is picturesque.  I heard birds singing in the trees, horses neighing in the background & the sun was shining through the trees.  WHAT.  WHERE AM I.  This is not the South Mountain I am used to... thankfully.  This place is a little escape... a farm oasis in the middle of the desert.  Me gusta.  i had the South Mountain Omelette.  It had lots of tasty seasonal veggies, goat cheese & a little zing of green chile sauce.  I also opted for the seasonal fruit... glad I did.  Everything was so fresh.  I left feeling satisfied & happy, not overly stuffed like I do at most greasy breakfast places.  You know the ones.  Coffee, tea & water are self-serve.  I like that.  A lot.  Our waitress was very sweet.  A little boy ran out into the gardens & one of the farmers gave him a little squash.  What??  Is this real life???  I didn't think places like this still existed but I am so happy that they do.  :)

This place is definitely worth the long trek out to Gilbert.  It's some sort of retro farm house planted in the midst of beautiful scenery... you won't miss it.  Ahi Tuna Burger is heavenly.  Juicy seared Ahi tuna served on a bun w/ crunchy cabbage mix and a side of wasabi mayo?  Count me in.  Serious.  I always get the sweet potato fries because they are some sort of perfection.  This place serves the freshest food I have ever seen.  I guess the farm part helps?  I would count this place down because there are usually so many loose children conquering the beautiful grounds while parents mindlessly chat amongst themselves but... I'm not that heartless.  It's usually always clean, the misters keep you cool & the heaters keep you warm.  This place is good for everyone... just beware of Chandler/Gilbert moms & dads who think farm grill is code for playground.

The cupcakes!  Oh, the cupcakes.  I frequent Joe's but always passed over this place.  I work at a coffee shop so I just wasn't interested.  I'm so glad I stopped in...  the red velvet cupcake was to die for.  Seriously.  When I think cupcakes, I think airy and light... super sweet.  This one was dense.  Every bite made me so happy.  My little sister & I split one... I really didn't want to share, it was that good & rich.  I also had a Spanish Latte... which was delicious.  I'm sort of an annoying coffee snob so I was surprised that I liked it so much.  Yum.

Can Mr Pineapple be year-round?  Please.   I love this place.  It's always packed full.  I've never not waited here & that sucks.  Maybe try making a reservation?  The wait is worth it though... just grab a beer at the bar... please don't order a mixed drink or wine.  BEER.   Food is great.  I stick with the pizza.  I've had the pretzels but they weren't life-changing.  Be prepared.  It gets super loud on the weekends as the night goes on... you won't be able to hear anyone next to you unless they're shouting or you read lips.

The Caribbean food that I'm used to deep fries just about everything... fried plantains, empanadas, etc... loads you up with rice... leaves you feeling like you might develop instant diabetes...   The Breadfruit was the perfect change from that.  The decor is great... I felt transported to somewhere tropical... almost like I could step outside on the beach.  Not in a tacky way.  It was very authentic & made me think of past excursions to the Caribbean.  The patio was cute but small so we opted to stay inside.  Service was everything I expect from waitstaff... our waitress was super attentive & knowledgeable.  I ordered a couple of cocktails from the Rum Bar... which I definitely recommend doing.  Mojito Classic to start the meal because I'm boring... & also Beets The Blues because I couldn't look away from it.  Both were glorious.  We started the meal with Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls... interesting... the mango chutney was the star of that dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad... I wasn't expecting much from a salad but it was great.   You can tell everything is made with fresh & quality ingredients.  I wish more restaurants were like this.  I had the guava glazed pork belly.  Melt in your mouth pork with a tangy sweet sauce.  If I was a little more tipsy, I probably would have licked my plate.  The mash included on the plate was also delicious...  but I find myself fantasizing over the pork belly.  So.  Good.  All in all, it was great & I can't wait to go back.

i love this place.  i've been here a handful of times.  the staff is always very helpful & sweet... my boyfriend recently brought me in for valentine's day and it was perfect.  they were a little busy but that's expected.  i had a glass of greek white wine that started things off right... we ordered the red pepper hummus with cucumbers and hummus... and it was delicious.  the cucumbers were fresh; the hummus had the perfect amount of spice.  yummy.  my boyfriend had the pesto burger... which was absolutely amazing.  i know, i know... burger at a greek place.  but trust me!  the burger was cooked to perfection and he said it was the best burger that he's ever had.  maybe i'm lying about that... but it really was yummy.  i had the ahi tuna & greek salad... which was on the valentine's menu.  good... good... i'm pretty stuck on the gyro but it was a nice change of pace.  a little lighter than what i'm used to but still tasty.    i was able to order some baklava to go.  ORDER THE BAKLAVA.  i haven't been able to find any that compares... it's that great.

Love this location!  I usually buy my veggies here.  Everything is so well priced.  They also carry some of my favorite kombucha drinks.  OM NOM.  And the sandwiches... you have to try them.  They are perfect for lunch.  Everyone is super friendly too.

Big portions.  Be prepared to share.  We had the lasagna & the chopped antipasto salad... both were delicious.  The lasagna was freshly baked (the plate was about a thousand degrees) & stuffed with cheese.  Left me wanting more meat though.  The salad was everything I want an antipasto to be-- just the right amount of cheeses, meats & veggies. Ordered smalls & the two of us definitely left full.  Our total with a glass of wine & a beer was about $50.  Good place to celebrate a special occasion-- there is plenty of room for big parties.  For a chain restaurant, they're doing it right.

this place was AMAZING.  i will drive anywhere for a good brunch. i live on the outskirts of chandler so the trek to queen creek wasn't asking much.  hidden away in a little strip mall, you might drive by it... do not panic.  it's there, i promise.  there isn't a hostess table.  do not be confused.  someone will eventually talk to you.  just look sad & lost.  we were seated after about 15 minutes.  the place was pretty packed at eleven.  lots of families & loud babies.  the patio seems like a nice oasis from that mess but we were seated next to the restrooms inside.  i'm not even mad.  we started with the mozzarella and warm prosciutto drizzled with pesto.  who knew something so simple would be that great... my mouth is watering thinking about it.  for brunch, i ordered the eggs benedict.  soo good.  instead of an english muffin, the eggs were situated on a flaky homemade biscuit.  glorious butter.  and those potatoes... heavenly.  all of the food i tried was FRESH.  they know good food.  i'm excited to go back... i feel like i found a little gem in queen creek.

i'm so happy i found this place.  when i heard the word pasty, it didn't exactly coincide with great food in my mind.  but that forever has changed,  the pilgrim was amazing.  hands down, best thing i've eaten in a while.  turkey, stuffing & roasted veggies with a side of cranberry sauce & red wine gravy.  like thanksgiving dinner in a little bundle of joy.   dessert was delicious as well.  apple & caramel pasty with vanilla ice cream.  the pasty was fluffy and buttery and glorious and all of the things you want when you are feeling like a fat kid.    nice beer selection.  i chose a trusty Guinness but i wish i had been brave & perused the beer menu a bit more. next time.  can't wait to go back.

Stopped in during the lunch rush on a Thursday with my mom and little sister.  They love the place... my mom is always raving about their blu chicken sandwich (avocado, lettuce, bacon, tomato, swiss & herb mayo) and my sister loves the blu burger (caramelized onions, gorgonzola cheese & bacon).  I was playing vegetarian the last time I was in town so the bluburger grille didn't really appeal to me at the time...  Thankfully, the vegetarian thing was just a phase and I was ready to say hello to meat again.  I decided to build my own burger... ordered American Kobe beef on whole wheat with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onions and bacon w/ herb mayo.  Delicious.  One of the best burgers I've had... but I'm not sure if I'd be willing to pay the $14 again.  The service was horrible... I understand being swamped but the guy disappeared.  I'm only knocking down one star for that.  Sweet potato fries were awesome as well.  I'm a fan, for sure.

Oh, sweet sweet Fro-Yo perfection. This stuff is healthy, right?  :\  I love Kokomo.  I really do.  A little pricier than I would want to pay but ehh... it's Chandler & people are willing to spend that.  The decor is fun!  Really modern.  It looks like the future!  There is definitely not enough seating... this place gets packed on weeknights during the summer.  Not an overwhelming selection of froyo but definitely a lot of fun toppings... plenty of fruit options & candy options.  My personal favorite... cheesecake chunks, strawberry & extra graham cracker with cheesecake froyo.  UGHH... heaven.  They're serving up random pastries & chocolates & gelato.  Whattt?  Looks good but when I'm craving froyo, that's usually what I stick with.  Maybe I'll give the pastries a chance someday...

I love this location.  It's beautiful & the two levels really set it off.  Great assortment of graphic novels, not just your typical comic book genre.  Didn't find as many great deals as I have at other locations... not sure why but it's a nice spot to hang out.  A lot of seating for reading which I enjoy.

Best. Popcorn. Ever.  Their kettlecorn & cheddar flavors are great... a little pricey but I think it's worth it.  They pretty much have a flavor for everyone... sweet, savory... they get richer with the premium flavors like cupcake & caramel chocolate.  Ask for a free sample if in doubt.

I love Paletas Betty so much & make a habit of stopping in whenever I'm near downtown Chandler.  My favorite flavor is the Pineapple with chile.  SOO good.  Perfect sweet & hot combination.  I also love the little stickers on the packages.  Super cute.

Mehh.  We picked up five cupcakes for Mother's Day & I really wish we didn't.  Salted Caramel, Key Lime, Lemon Raspberry, the Original Chocolate one & Coconut.  Total came out to $22?  Pricey but okay.  Whatever.  You pay for quality, right?  The girl boxed up our cupcakes & the box broke open while we were walking back to my car.  Whaaat??  We shared the cupcakes with our mom that night... the cupcakes were dry & the flavors were barely there.  I was embarrassed that we wasted money on such a lackluster present.  Salted Caramel was so promising but had the strangest plastic texture.  The shop is super cute, maybe they were having a bad day?  If you're in Gilbert, I definitely recommend going to The Coffee Shop by Joe's Farm Grill if you need cupcakes.

Is this real life?  I'm not sure who would actually pay a cover to get into this place.  I don't even know how to describe it.  The fifteen minutes I spent here felt like an eternity & I never want to repeat the experience again.  I get that it's Mill Avenue & I'm sure these places get really beat up.  But it was beat up.  Everything was sticky.  Sticky like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  The only other people in the place looked like they were still in high school.  One was wearing an invader zim backpack.  There isn't a dress code here.  The poor bartender looked depressed.  I would be too.    Never again.

Visited for dinner on a monday with my fam... Saw the 50 percent off sushi sign at the entrance. What... They have sushi?   The place wasn't busy at all. There was a couple eating and another guy ordering take out. We were promptly seated and brought drinks.   I decided on sushi, my hopes not very high. I ordered the chandler roll and the rainbow roll. My sister ordered mu shu pork, my mom ordered lo mein. We also ordered spare ribs to split.  After a round of water and complimentary fried noodle chips, we were served or appetizer. The spare ribs came out nice and hot... The flavor was delicious! A perfect combo of sweet and savory.  Next, my sushi order... The chandler roll was great. I usually don't do rolls, but I'm glad I did. The roll was beautiful and the taste matched. And for six dollars, I can't complain.  The rest of the food was great, we were all stuffed. The service was also amazing. I know its tough in that shopping center so I hope they stick around!   Definitely will visit this place when I'm back in town.

If you are craving Mexican food at 3 in the morning, this place is for you.  Holy Taco Tuesday.  Who can say no to a delicious chicken or beef taco for a dollar? Horchata is also a sugar-overdose of a wonderland.     They also have the best breakfast burritos.  Hands down.  Eggs, bacon, extra cheese & pico.   They will put ANYTHING into your burrito.  Just ask.  I've heard a lot of things about the Super Nachos but I cannot find it in my heart to order them.  Make sure to extra red sauce all of the things.

hot wing pizza!  ...just what i was craving,  we ordered carryout on a sunday... it was ready in twenty minutes.  we ordered an antipasto salad to start... which wasn't too thrilling.  but the pizza made up for it!  each slice was a meal in itself.  will definitely be going back. :)

Came here for Sunday brunch with the boyfriend.  A little hungover from the night before... go figure.  If you can ride your bike or walk here, do that.  Parking was a nightmare.  No, I don't want to valet my car but thanks anyway.  $10 for a beer & a meal?  That is something I'm willing to invest in.  Given the parking situation, we figured the place would have major wait times... not the case.  We were seated immediately.  The inside looks like a hipster warehouse.  Is that a thing?  It is now.  Atmosphere is laid back.  Really nice beer selection.  There is something for everyone... and brunch was fantastic.  I had the churrasco steak & egg.  I don't know if it was my hungover state of mind but the proportion was perfect & the flavor was spot on.  After brunch, we walked out to the patio.  What a cute little spot.  I love how dog friendly everything is... they have a little dog washing station.  AW.  Adorable.  Can't wait to go back.  :)

i can't say enough great things about my experience at this spa.    it was amazing. i went in almost a week ago and i still feel like i'm glowing.  i was able to snag a groupon for a couple's experience... i was just looking for a basic couple's massage for my boyfriend's birthday at a reasonable price.  this spa day was anything but basic.    we spent twenty minutes in an infrared sauna where we sweated it out together.  look a quick shower and then had a 90 minute lomi lomi massage with hot shells.  the massage was insane.  i feel like i blacked out from being so pampered.  it was absolutely perfection.  after the massage, we were able to do a sugar scrub and a mud mask before we showered off.  there was even a little ice cream treat at the end... sounds weird but it was amazing!!!  i cannot recommend this place enough.  everyone was so kind & mellow... they weren't pushy at all.  i wanted to spend all of my days there.  don't be turned off by the weird strip mall location.  the inside is like a little island oasis!!  i admit... i was a little frightened that they were right next to a mexican food restaurant and a sports bar.  uhh what?  but now i love their little spot on the lake.  i can't wait to go back. :)

Stopped around 1 for a glass of wine & bruschetta with the boyfriend.  I've heard so much about Postino & it definitely lived up to the hype.  Luckily, we were able to just walk in without the crazy wait & choose a comfy pair of chairs with a great view of the patio.  The waitstaff is amazing.  They seem to really enjoy being there & it shows in the service.  I enjoyed a $5 glass of wine & the boyfriend chose a $5 pitcher of beer... the bruschetta ended up being a little pricey but it went above and beyond what I expected from bruschetta.  Delicious.    It was worth the drive to downtown Gilbert.  All in all, a very cute date spot.  I love the lawn in the back!  The overall style is so modern without being stuffy-- it's definitely a place you'll want to stay.  I wish more places were like Postino.

We stopped by for a drink in December.  It was freezing but they had heaters so that was nice.  Great views of the city.  I could see this place being a lot of fun in the summertime with the pool.  They had a DJ playing but the cold had cleared everyone out.  Drinks were strong.  A really good time.  I wish more places were like this in Phoenix.

The best hookah that I've had in a while.  Tempe has been letting me down a lot with hookah over the years but Nara is awesome.  Attentive staff who definitely make sure that you're comfortable.  The music was great... a little loud at times but I can't really complain.  My new hookah spot. :)

This place was disappointing-- I wanted it to be so much better.  The service is awful.  I've tried them out twice... but It's almost like they try to ignore you.  & this was on a weeknights when the place wasn't busy at all.  How is that even possible?  Beers are very overpriced.  Our waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about which was tough.  The beer she did recommend was something super sweet & fruity... just because I'm female, doesn't mean I like beer that tastes like a juice box.  It's hard to go wrong when you're called World of Beer, but wow. Lots of potential, just not following through.

I really like this place. I really really like it.  31 draft craft beers... all written out on some sort of chalk board... you are bound to find one that your little heart desires.  I really enjoy oatmeal stouts so my waitress was able to recommend one that I fell in love with.  They are ever-changing.  A little on the pricier end but worth it.  The decor is great... & I love the patio.    Their flights are served on muffin pans.  I thought that was super clever.  Food looks great... I stole some sort of meaty concoction of a pizza slice for the people I was with & it was cheesy perfection.  Can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu as well.

I like the decor... was definitely impressed by the amount of TVs.  My boyfriend and I sat at a high top to watch the ASU game.  The place was a  little empty but it was still pretty early in the day.  I'm curious to see how it acts as a club.  Salads were overpriced, but who honestly orders a salad at a bar?  You shouldn't.  But we did anyway.  I didn't realize that bacon on a salad meant bac-o's, Firehouse... but thank you for educating me.  Had a vodka soda.  It wasn't great.  Our waitress was super sweet though & really attentive.    Next time, I'll try this place when I'm in the mood for wings & beer.

Kiwi Loco is my new favorite froyo place around.  The employees are always super friendly, the place is spotless... great options for fresh toppings.  i wish there was a little more variety in the froyo flavors but they are all so tasty i really don't mind.  White chocolate & blueberry are my favorites.  They also have a topping station in the front with graham cracker,  sugar cone, etc... so you can add a base before you pour your froyo.  Genius.  Two for one on Tuesday... amazzzing.

I feel like this Zipps is still trying to get it together.    I frequent a few of the other Zipps around town, and whenever I step into this one (which happens to be closest to my home) I just feel ignored and a little sad.  It just doesn't have that... feel... it's hard to explain but this location is usually my last resort.  One star for zipparitas which make me forget about the bad service.  One star for sweet jalapeno.  Sweet jalapeno is nectar of the gods.  FACT.

we honestly stopped in because postino was super packed.. so it was kind of a back up plan.  but definitely happy we stopped by.  joyride is super cute.  the decor is fun & the atmosphere is upbeat.  i had to try a mazatlan mule, which ended up being delicious.   we snacked on the chips and salsa & cheese y mas.  the cheese dip was ok.  but the street corn was amazing.  i'll definitely come back to try some of the entrees & more booze. :)

recently stopped by on a weekend.  beautiful spot... the hotel is gorgeous.  it's a little bit of a road trip if you live in phoenix... i felt like i was driving for days.  also felt creeped out as i was walking through the parking lot... it attracts a shady crowd at night.  but then again, it's a casino... things aren't going to be rainbows and butterflies.    lost a lot of cash.  i can't blame the casino. that's my own fault... i dropped twenty dollars on the ground & some little old lady ran off with it.  kind of put a damper on my night.  securrrrrity.    i'm going to try to stay a night here and see how i like it.  maybe my luck will change.

I love this Chipotle!!  They always take care of me despite my super picky order... I'm sure they hate it but they definitely don't let it show!!!  Everything's always fresh & even if they're busy, they still don't rush you.  Love them!

I'm updating my review!  How times have changed...   I feel skimped for the past three visits & I won't be coming back.  It's kind of a running joke on how stingey Chipotle is on giving out meat.  But seriously... if I'm paying for double meat, please load me up.  It's seriously all I get.  I don't get rice... I don't get beans... I don't even want a tortilla... I want veggies & MEAT.  I've given up on ordering guacamole also because it's been this sad little dollop of avocado paste.  What happened to the glorious days of fair portions??  I used to love this Chipotle... but the workers seem so out of touch with their customers.  Please get it together so I can give you my money.

I was a little apprehensive at first... seriously though.  Pizza is an art.  Build your own pizza?  Are you sure??  Happy to have found this place.  The pizza was delicious.  Like... one of the best I've had in a while.  Maybe because I was able to get all of the toppings that I could ever want?  & super affordable.  Careful during lunch... it gets insanely packed & rightfully so.  Worth the wait.

loved.  recently stopped in on whim for a little dinner date with my mom.  we made it in time for happy hour... so we stuck with half priced appetizers.  it was nice to hear that they do happy hour seven days a week & reverse happy hour on friday and saturday.  we started with the fire lake oysters.  so clean & fresh, slightly sweet.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were some of the best.  we also tried the steam black mussels... which i love.  the flavor was on point & we were able to soak up the broth with the fresh sour dough bread.  it was glorious.  we ordered a crab cake to split... some places really try to skimp you on crab meat but this one was perfection.  it was served with a fried avocado & micro green salad... and that aoili though... awesome.  ended the night with the bread pudding.  ...the most amazing end of the meal.  get the bread pudding!  unfortunately, we didn't get around to entrees.  i was stuffed.  but i will definitely be frequenting this place!  i am so happy to have somewhere close to home with quality seafood.      the service was on point... a little slower toward the end but the restaurant started getting super busy around six.  still, everyone was so friendly.  the decor is great.  it feels like you're next to some beach, some where... not in the outskirts of gilbert.  the bar is awesome... i heard a nice little rumor that they have a bloody mary bar on sunday mornings with a bacon wrapped shrimp.  i can't wait to try it out.

Soo good.  So many flavors.  It's the perfect shaved ice.  I love their sugar free selection. The last couple of times, they've really skimped on flavors so I get a huge clump of unflavored ice.  That sucks!  Just hang around and make sure they add more syrup to your ice before you go.

I really enjoyed Zinburger.  Whatever.  12 dollars for a burger.  But it's an amazing burger.  I don't know why so many people are crying about the price... don't go?  Or go during happy hour to save a few bucks?  Who cares if they don't include fries in the price, ya cheapos.    We sat at the bar & had a beer.  This was the right choice.  Great people watching & were well attended to.  Zucchini fries.  YUMM. Loaded fries.  Even better.  We split the breakfast burger... which had a fried egg, bacon & avocado... it was melt in your mouth good.  Their bloody mary was just... mehh.  I appreciate putting bacon on everything but it tasted like canned tomato juice.  Won't be ordering that ever again.  Other than that, great place!
