Went in for a gel manicure and a pedicure last week. Tracy did a great job while carrying on a nice conversation and making me feel pampered.

One thing I really like about this place is that they are very organized and were able to get me in very quickly.  I had a similar experience to many others where my right eye looked great because the technician took her time but my left eye looked a little off because she was more rushed. The lashes were full but they weren't all pointing the right direction so when I looked at them once I got to the car it looked like I had a little cowlick in my eyelashes. I was in a hurry so I couldn't go back but definitely disappointed. The other thing that I don't love is how quickly the lashes are coming off. After only one week over half of them were gone. The glue is not strong enough. They're just falling off my natural lash when I simply touch my eye.

Working with Ashley was a dream!! She was always available to answer any questions and her turn around time was even shorter than she officially said. She captured to many wonderful memories of our special day. I'd recommend her to anyone looking for someone talented, organized, and simple amazing!!!
