EAT the chips and salsa!!!  You will not be disappointed!    Chicken enchiladas are A-MA-ZING!    Great patio!

Be sure to try the hummus sampler!  Different flavors that I have never enjoyed before, all really good.   Loved the outdoor seating, perfect for a sunny, spring day!  I tried a lamb dish...silver skin was not removed before cooking = WAY TO TOUGH TO EAT!  Others in my party really enjoyed their food.  I would give it another try...just stay away from the lamb.  Sides were good.

I recently dined with a large party.  They had a great room to accommodate our group!  It is nice to dine with so many people and TALK with each of the dinner guests.   The staff was eager to please (took photos, made menu suggestions, recommended beers / wines...even swapped out the drinks if you didn't enjoy).    As I dined with a large group, we ate from a set menu...appetizers of bread, spreads and Italian meats were delicious.  The salads were good.  I was pleased with my choice of the crab stuffed chicken and even happier with the cheesecake for desert!
