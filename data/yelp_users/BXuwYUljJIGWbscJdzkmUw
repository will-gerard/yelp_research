My friend and I went here for lunch. The place was busy (which is a good sign). The server offered us drinks right away. Though they were busy, we didn't wait that long for our food to be served. I ordered Pad Thai mild but it was still a bit spicy for my taste. I told the server about this and she took my food back, no questions asked. She came back with freshly cooked Pad thai which was perfect!   The portions were huge for such a reasonable price. I give this place 5 stars for not only superb food but excellent service as well.

Not a big fan. Hubby went here to get our car inspected. The guy quoted a repair cost that was a bit higher than what we expected. The mechanic tried to pressure my hubby into doing the repairs at their shop.   we Went to another repair shop (AAA certified) and we were given a quote of $180 less for the same sevice. We will not be returning to this place.

it's in a bad location in Chandler. Long wait and the quality is not good. Place is dirty and stinky. Go to a different location.

The staff at Chandler Eyecare are great! I was seen promptly and didn't have to wait a long time to meet with the doctor.I met with Dr. Van Over and she was extremely nice and thorough.   The office is very clean. They also have plenty of frames to choose from. After the eye exam, a staff will go over your insurance details with you so you know what is covered and how much out of pocket you have. I haven't received my glasses yet but I'm confident that they will turn out great!   I love this place! Highly recommended!

We have finally found an honest car repair shop. Tim is the best! We bought a used car and brought it here for inspection. They inspected it for free! They will only do the repairs needed for your car and not try to scare you into repairing other things that don't need fixing. real honest place. We have had all our cars serviced here and always get a great service. Highly recommended.

Love the ambience. the inside has a "loft" feel to it and the patio is very inviting. great place for a casual date.   They serve soups, salads, and sandwiches. The brown Bag sandwich is phenomenal.

fresh pandesal and lechon!!!!  one pound is more more than enough for 3 people. they also have crispy pata and chicharin bulaklak. both i'll try when i go back next week. so glad there's a place here in Chandler that could satisfy my craving for lechon at a very affordable price. $8.95 for a pound.   I also got the fresh pandesal. it was light and fluffy but a bit too sweet for my taste.

Great Burger!! comparable to In-n-Out. the fries are fresh and very tasty. A small order of fries was good enough for two people.

The office is very clean and the staff is friendly. I went here for an oil change and they serviced my car right away (we were lucky that they had an opening at the time we got there). I would recommend making an appointment to ensure you don't wait long. Oil change included full inspection and they will tell you what needs to ve fixed urgently and what can wait. I got the feeling that this place is honest and won't take advantage of people like me who doesn't knowuch about cars.  When we were about to leave, we mentioned that one of our brake lights were out. The staff apologized for overlooking this in the inspection and fixed my brake lights for free!! the search is over for a good, reliable, and honest car repair shop. I will be bringing my cars here from now on.

This is a family owned business. Located in an old plaza. Place is clean and they have a window to the kitchen so you can watch them prepare pizza dough. This is enough to keep my toddler fascinated. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Place is small but they have outside seating. The pizza is amazing. First time I went, my husband and I each ordered a big ass slice of pizza. They were not kidding. It was huge! Biggest slice of pizza I've ever been served. The wings were ok, nothing special about them. Since our first visit, my husband and I have been back twice.
