Panchos- 2 eggs 2 pancakes & your choice of meat. I had bacon.   For my bacon, all I tasted was Salt! Eggs were good. Pancakes were tasteless. Service was ok. But I would NOT come here again.

Super sweet lady! I had my bridesmaid's dress taken in and shorten a bit came out perfect. I also brought in my 2y/o daughter's flower girl dress to be taken in and also came out perfect.   I bought out dresses from brides by Demetrios. Scheduled an apt with Hayla on Sunday and it was ready right on time, (1 week) for both dresses. The price for both dresses were very reasonable. I will definitely be sending referrals her way, and definitely be back when I need any alteration done.
