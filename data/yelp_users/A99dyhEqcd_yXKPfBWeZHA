Went here for our first ultrasound and I was impressed with the office, staff, and equipment.  The location is a bit hard to find as there is no signage outside, but once inside the building, you can easily find their suite on the suite locator by the elevators.  The morning staff was friendly, helpful and answered all my questions with a genuine interest to help.  She was helpful in putting me at ease.  The gal that did my ultrasound was very knowledgeable and thorough.  She was not one of those technicians that just evaluates your ultrasound without piping in with comments or facts.  I usually have experienced that at SimonMed (the technicians gather the data but say nothing to you while gathering it.. which can really be stressing since a stern look at your ultrasound can cause you to worry for no reason).  I enjoyed her company and both hubby and I were happy to have had her do our ultrasound.  The Dr. that came afterwards did no additional screening which seemed fine since we got TONS of pictures (even 3D!).  The tools are impressive and I would come here again for the same service.  I recommend this facility based on the pleasant office, office staff, and ultrasound technician staff.  MY ONLY complaint was that this business is SO busy, I basically had to beg the central scheduling office to find me an appointment quickly because their next opening was way later than I wanted... she was mildly helpful but eventually got me in to a farther location after another person cancelled their appointment.

I visited this monastery with my in-laws recently.  We had heard about it from my bro-in-law and so we decided we'd visit on a Saturday afternoon ... we drove to Florence from Chandler and were surprised to find such an oasis in the desert.  This place really makes you feel like you're somewhere else - the beautiful buildings, the greenery, the peace you feel when you enter the monastery.. we were delighted to have taken the recommendation to visit.  I had very respectable clothing (pants, long sleeve shirt), but they required women's head to be covered and a skirt to be worn, so they were kind enough to lend us elastic skirts that I just put over my pants.. and I found a scarf in the car - presto, ready to go!  The staff there is very friendly in the gift shop and they have wonderful treats and gourmet items for sale that are made from the gardens there and made by the ladies and gentlemen living a monastic life there... got some wonderful tea and delicious baked goods.  Walking through the site was, again, peaceful and made you feel you were not in Arizona.  We enjoyed ourselves and I would recommend this place for adults (children make a lot of noise and it's very peaceful here) that appreciate these sorts of experiences .. nice day trip.

My home airport, so with work travel, I'm passing through here very often. I prefer Terminal 4 because of the variety of eating/drinking options for pre-flight enjoyment, and 2 and 3 are just OK and don't offer so much in amenities... but they're less crowded and that is a nice plus.  Also, free wifi!  I rarely get lost in here and to be honest, security here has never been an issue... lines have been long going to gates in Term 4 but they move fairly quickly.  I don't do body-scans (my personal choice), so if you choose to do the same, when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners, alert the TSA person and let them know you'll need a pat-down (or a groping.. feel-up.... whatever you wanna call it ;)).  Electing to do this takes me longer to get through security, but I prefer it and plan ahead.  Also, if you have a digital boarding pass on your iPhone or Android and go through a *different* gate (they are mostly all connected via runways, etc) due to the line at the gate you're supposed to go through, note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass... this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line.. luckily they had the kiosk just there so I ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot.  FYI!!

I really like flying Alaska Air, for a few reasons: 1) it's out of Terminal 2, which means a quick walk in/walk out, almost no wait in line, easy bag check-in and easy baggage claim. 2) I have almost always experienced pleasant stewards on all AK flights... for the most part genuinely friendly, prompt, and of good spirits 3) Alaska Air (one of my favorite aspects) is all about recycling and using local or at least AK, HI, or Pacific Northwest-based businesses for their on-board food/drinks for sale - this is such a pleasure to see and it makes me want to continue doing business with them 4) $20 baggage check-in fee... $5 cheaper than USAir.. not bad 5) When I've upgraded to First Class upon check-in in the past, it's costed me $50/leg of my itinerary - score!!  This is why I like Alaskan Air!

I have to admit that I do like my jewelry ... though I wouldn't necessarily say that diamonds are a girl's best friend ... maybe more like emeralds and sapphires. My sister had her killer set designed by Christopher and so I was looking for a custom style (though much MUCH less ostentatious than hers) for mine. My coworker also had hers custom designed by Christopher so I was sold on giving him our business. Add to the fact that they are in our neighborhood and are a local small business we'd like to support.  Christopher is a nice guy and they did a great job on my jewelry as well as other jewelry I brought in.  All of his work is well done, with quick turn-around times, honest quotes, affordable and he is very creative and skilled... plus he can just about re-create any Cartier piece for a fraction of the price!  I still visit from time to time for cleanings and just to browse..hoping to treat myself to an emerald ring Cornellis Hollander of Scottsdale designed that I think Christopher can replicate with some changes ... one of these days.

Love love love eating here.  I often crave their Black Bean Burger and have tried to make one at home but haven't figured out a few ingredients they use (flavor-wise).. oh well, I guess I'lll just have to come here for it.  Other things i LOVE to eat here: - Caramelized Cauliflower w/ Tahini - oof, so my favorite! - Lentils!! I love cumin and this definitely hits the spot - Grilled Vegetable Salad.. they are not stingy at all with the portions on this one - Lavash 'Quesadilla' starter.. OMG.. crispy, cheesy, oh my!  Food has always been great tasting, never disappoints and I do not get bored.  Only downside is that when this place gets busy, it gets BUSY and you have to wait a lot longer for food turn-around time... servers are quick and I've never had bad service (just maybe slow service, but hardly a fault of theirs if the kitchen is slammed).

I've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots... usually a decent experience... This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).    This particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.    The place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said "yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking "really??? are you serious??" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF! You can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway...   THEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?.. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.  all in all, I'm not sure I'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever.  Sorry, but I've experienced better.

I like the staff here - the young'ns are friendly and not snarky or rude the way I can imagine I might be if I was forced to deal with the incessant crowd of hippies, homeless, 9-to-5ers and picky folks.  I can't say anything about their espressos as I've mostly gotten fraps here (a rare treat for me) and tea.. I usually go here to hang out with my sis (who is literally a permanent fixture here) and it's a nice atmosphere inside and outside with all the seating available (definitely a huge draw to this place, as it is plentiful).

I really like coming here because they have so many things that I am just entertained even if I don't go in to necessarily buy something.. though I usually always end up buying something because their prices are GREAT.  Their kitchen stuff has great prices (on the order of .80c and 1.50 for some little gadgets!), as that's the section where I usually start my browsing.  Their food/drink section is impressive in variety and regions and is well too stocked for me to spend lots of time perusing... I'll just end up buying more chocolate or more wine than I already need.  But I've found some fun and unique treats there as me-gifts or gifts for others.  Their furniture stuff can be a bit pricey, but I like that is is more 'unique' and has a 'worldy' look to it.  Also, they have TONS of little chotchkies (sp?) - so if you like looking at chotchkies, this is the spot.  Almost forgot to mention - they double charged me on something and I went back the next day to tell them about it to get it fixed and they easily and quickly fixed it.. no hassle, no problems, no looking at me suspiciously.  That was appreciated.

I do not typically go to chain restaurants & then yelp 4 stars but I was genuinely impressed with our server (Cliff) and Carrabas kitchen.  I have been doing a food detox as of the first of the year and the waiter AND the kitchen were so accomodating, even going as far as asking if it was OK with me if they could add certain vegetables to my salad I had ordered (they wanted it to look nice and taste good) to make it more filling.. who does that!?  They do!  Went with my bro, his gf, and my hubby and they had a great old-vine Zin (bottles of wine are on special on Wednesdays) and they seemed to enjoy their meal (though my bro thought his veal marsala was a bit smaller than it should be).  We were seated promptly, the staff (Cliff & kitchen guys) was very attentive and I have to give them 4 stars for going above and beyond what chain restaurants usually serve.

Why this Chandler Wilfdlower is better than .. you know who else at the Chandler mall food-court: -Their salads have great combinations and lost of ingredients -Their sandwiches are on the inventive and creative side -Their website has really thorough nutrition and you can customize your salads based what type of nutrition info you're concerned about -Their staff has always been really friendly & they're quick and keep the place clean -They rotate their salads/sandwiches (not sure if it's seaonally), but this is how I tried the awesome Cuban sandwich they had not too long ago. -Their manager lady so awesomely offered my sister a gift-card last time when her order took what the manger thought was "excessively long" to bring out... that is with zero complaining or face making.. the Manager just did it on her own. -PLUS, they have weekly complimentary bread tastings (better than chippers, I think) with butter or olive oil near the check-out line.. yum!

This is pretty much my favorite place to shop for very specific kitchen gadgets or cook ware (yes, they're better than WilliamsS because they have a ton of variety).  Yes, it is pricey if you're buying the big name brands, but the gadgets are priced competitively and they always have a great and well-stocked 'clearance' section in the case you want to grab some great deals.  Their baking tools are varied and they carry a lot of sizes (from HUGE to tiny) for your baking and decorating needs.  Their SLT white porcelain is moderately priced (though World Market may be cheaper some times).  Their staff here is helpful and not pestering.. there have been very few times that I've not found what I wanted or needed for our house/kitchen or for a gift..  I like getting their catalog because you can find great cooking courses (at the Keirland location, though) and they occasionally send you $10 off coupons!

Okay, this is another instance where I officially state that I don't often go to chain restaurants and then go home and rate them a 4-Star only because most of my experience are usually 3-Stars.  Also, I'd like to clarify that I am giving this rating based on service and not necessarily on food, though the food was on par and as expected.  We had a great time at PF Changs today... only reason we went here was because my sis was craving "chinese".  Anyway, our server J was awesome and so was the manager (with whom we had a lengthy, funny, conversation about burgers, of all things).  The food was as expected but I was mostly impressed w/ our server who, when I told him in a joking manner that I might start gnawing on his arm because I was so hungry, he said, "give me a sec" and ran back to the kitchen and had them whip up our meal pronto.  It came out quickly and everything except the Buddha's feast was exactly as ordered.  Our server was not a fake friendly guy, he was just real though friendly, funny, and quick.  He didn't do any of that annoying interrupting stuff (I hate that, esp when you're in a deep conversation with someone and they interrupt you to ask if you want water.. yes, it's empty 'cuz I've been suckin' it down so please go for it) and walked by often enough so that if we needed something, we could grab him easily.  My martini (Dragon something or other) was pretty good, though a bit too sweet for my taste to order again.  My eggplant was really good (then again I was really hungry).  But like I said, our server was great and provided the kind of service that makes you want to come back because it's rare to find.  Yeah.. I know, I wasn't expecting that at all.  Also, they had a decently sized Gluten Free offerings for those with Gluten allergies - that's great to find!

I haven't come in to this salon in over 6 years or more... It's definitely been redone to a more appropriate decor since then. My main reason for ceasing to come was I found stylists at Leidan Mitchell with the same level of expertise at a better price.  Got a GC from my beautiful sister and niece for here and it was a great chance to try it all over again!  Booking was easy, I wanted a Friday evening, so I got Jovanna. She's quite young but she did a fantastic job. I wasn't sure what my hair would look like when i left (i opted for no blow drying since i was going straight home to put babies to bed afterwards) but i simply told her i wanted it to look nice and romantic when worn loose (layers) since my hair is naturally wavy after a shower. I don't know what she did, but I can wear my hair any side part and it is perfectly layered and stylish while having done nothing (i don't blow dry, i don't straighten, i don't even brush dry, only brush in the shower).  It's about a month later and I absolutely love how it falls and how i have the look i want with zero work besides washing it every few days. Length is perfect, layers are perfect, i literally don't ever want another haircut from anyone else... Ever!   AlsoI, I paid 45 (OK, there gift card did) before tip for this, i think it was definitely worth the price!  OK, so the only complaints: That shampoo i was cleaned with did something to my hair. I have never had so much hair fall of just after a hair wash like i did those weeks after... Wtf was in that stuff??? I only use EWG-approved shampoos, so this was crazy to me.  It was devoid of staff that evening and it still felt snooty... She wasn't at all, but you could tell her superiors were!

I am a big fan of this place.  I have been to it at least 6 times already and everything I've had has been really enjoyable, inventive, and also served with great-spirited staff.  They seem to hire only nice, friendly, people which really makes the experience more enjoyable.  Things I've had that I recommend: Pesto Burger, White Pizza, Sweet Potato dish, Blueberry Scone, Lattes, Wines and more.  I like that you stand in line to order, get a seat, and then you're brought your food.. makes it a casual, but upscale casual experience.  Every time I go I want to try something new because I look forward to being impressed again.  Location is great - easy parking; Atmosphere is also nice - lively, active, social, upscale feel yet still family-accomodating.  I always look forward to returning here.

Truly as good as i gets.  Just went again this weekend (on a Sat); the line looked intimidating, but it went faster than I thought.  The older gentleman who works there (my husband and I have had a lovely conversation with him before) was there again handing out menus as guests entered and we had another lovely conversation with him - we asked about the 'E61' name and he gave us the history of the Faeme E61 espresso machine one of the owners had brought over from Milan.. what an interesting story.  Needless to say, the espressos we had were outstanding - super dark and rich crema. The great thing we learned is that you can walk right up to the 'E61 Bar' and order your food/drink w/out having to wait in the long line (that is KEY to know!). Both our breakfast dishes were highly filling and very flavorful (their steak scramble is very tasty and I really like their honey biscuit). When the staff is continually friendly and prompt and their food is repeatedly tasty and filling - you are darn near 'as good as it gets'.

This place sits right next to Liberty Market and I've always seen it with a long line for breakfast - I understand why, now.  There are literally less than 20 tables in there and its small and crowded.. makes sense.  It took our party of 5 a while to be seated, but we had no complaints.  Our server gal was outstanding - friendly, genuine, and had a great memory (she took our order PLUS the table next to ours without writing one thing down and got our orders right!).  Their portions were also not disappointing - everyone's plate was full of food and the vegetable scramble (special) was impressive with asparagus and a colorful array of well-cooked vegetables.  My niece and I had Mimosas and they were served in a chilled chalice (sooo tasty).  The atmosphere was nice, service was excellent and the food was both tasty and plentiful - the wait was worth it!

We are regulars at Mikado.  I like to go Friday nights, though it does tend to get very busy and the wait is much longer (not like 20min+ wait, though).  Even so, the service is still friendly and their sushi is *always* tasty, fresh, and inventive (I like to order the chef's creation.. changes every time and is usually something not on the menu). I do like their lunch specials, too, and I like to occasionally go with co-workers for lunch (though, if it's a big group and we arrive at noon, it does take significantly longer to get done with dinner).  I have sat several times at the bar (with a friend or just alone) and I love that service - the sushi chefs are always friendly, jovial, and like to make light conversation.. plus, you get to see them make the orders.  One time, I forgot my wallet and realized this AFTER I had eaten and got the bill - the owners were there and since they knew I was a regular, she said not to worry about it - I felt mortified!  I said thank you for their kindness and left home quickly (I lived really close at that time) and got my cash and left a huge tip.. but that just shows you what type of people they are that own the place - kind people!  Let's just say they still remember me years later!

I'm not sure what's up with this place's renovations, but ever since they renovated a few years ago (maybe 2 or 3yrs), there is this distinct, nauseating smell when you first walk in... it could be the floors since they were completely re-done as part of the renovation.  Anyway, I think that is a big negative personally for me because I have a very sensitive nose and if I'm grossed out by the smell, I'm gonna get in and out as quickly as possible.  Besides that, this place is decent - their produce is always stocked, though they don't always have my salsa ingredients stocked when I need them.  They also have a pretty great selection of 'health stuff' which is easy to find - range free eggs, Cascadian Farm products, Applegate products, and the list actually does go on.  So, Kudos to them for responding to their demographic that like having more than one little corner of an aisle dedicated to 'healthy' alternative brands and products.  I usually do the automated check-out as that is usually quicker.. though those stupid machines ALWAYS require me to 'get assistance' because I bring my own grocery bag and it screws up their scale readins.. UGH.  Oh yeah, and they're open till midnight every day.. that's a plus when neighboring stores close by 10pm.

Took this class with some of my gal friends and we had a great time - the topic of that night was eggs!  I would have liked to learn a little more about the egg itself - the basics that chefs know about them (fat structure, protein structure), but this was more application.. ie. HOW do you use it for crepes... HOW do you use it for Poached Eggs.  The food came out very tasty and though another lady was subbing for the regular instructor, she did a good job of instructing us and explaining things.. though she seemed to change a bit of the recipe from the author (the regular instructor) which would make it confusing at times... Nevertheless, both my friends are taking the classes that span several months and I can tell they have learned a great deal already!  Braising, Sauces, etc...  I liked the ambiance: relaxed, open, explanatory, educational, experimental... plus it is set inside a store where you can buy kitchen tools and gadgets.  I rummaged through all their stuff and saw competitive prices and a great selection of kitchen and cooking items.  I would definitely return to do more classes here... it is educational, hands-on, and a great way to learn about cooking in a relaxed, helpful environment.

I really like Dr. Carr - he is outstanding.  You can't get a more attentive-to-detail, perfectionist dentist in the valley.  Add to that that the facility is nice and his staff is also outstanding: friendly, prompt, warm, skilled.  Also, Beverly at the front desk is a pillar there and I'm certain the place wouldn't be the same without her.  Back to Dr. Carr - I have been seeing him for several years now and I've always been happy with his work  - he fixed a chip in my front tooth that I thought was going to be a nightmare (it looks flawless!); he's done my root canal (seriously was not as bad an experience as I read it would be); he's done 2 crowns that look great; and I've done several teeth whitening with him as well as routine cleaning there.  The thing that stands out about Dr. Carr is that he is very methodical and is very much a perfectionist and you can see he trains his staff to be the same way when they are performing a service or just handling office business.  I am pretty sure if I had any other major dental work (yay! I just finished my Invisalign yesterday!), I'd be seeing him as my first choice.  I recommend him highly.

I really like this ball-park.  Every year for spring training, my boss takes us out to a weekday game (lawn seats) and we do a bit of tail-gating and a bit of game-watching.  This place has always had sufficient parking (or we've come early enough) for us to tail-gate in the stadium parking area (W or E lot) and then enjoy the game.  The price point for the goodies at the park are, as expected, a bit high.. but I got a 24oz of beer for 9 bux... steep, but afterall, it WAS 24oz and it was all I needed.  Our lawn seats were perfect, Left Field and the grass was on steroids: super soft, lush green, and beautifully maintained.. I don't need a blankie to sit on this grass because it's so soft and cushy.  The crowd is always nice for these Spring Training mid-week games.. fun, but not crazy and a good mix of old folks and young folks.  The bathrooms are amazingly clean and well kept and, overall, the facility itself is well maintained and makes the experience more enjoyable.

I'm quite impressed with this store.  I didn't expect it to offer more things than Sprouts (they recently merged) and, frankly, always thought Sprouts was the better of the two but I've changed that opinion.   I stopped in today and found vast rows of shelves of everything my local Chandler Sprouts carries *and then some*.  I kid you not, I found a lot of products that I've always *wished* my local sprouts would carry consistently (ie. local lamb, more Rosie's Organic Chicken options, and more Applegate product varieties) *and then some*.  Seriously worth a visit!  I parused their meat aisle (they have lots of beef livers and turkey giblets) and their veggie asiles (they have a LOT of herbs and they're way cheaper than I've seen at other groceries) and I'm sure hoping that now that Sprouts/Sunflower has merged, they will carry a lot of Sunflowers buying power to my little local store because I hate having to go all the way to WFoods sometimes just to pick up a few things.  Way to go Sunflower!  Too bad you're not in my neighborhood.

This place was quite busy for being a Friday afternoon.  The young gal at the register was not only friendly, but helpful in picking out what to try.  Since I was having a procedure done later, I wanted to lay off the espresso/caffeine, so I skipped that altogether and had an amazing iced Cinnamon Cardamon herbal tea.  Along with that I had a Zucchini muffin (proudly displayed next to about 6 other types of muffins they carry... all supposedly from a nearby bakery).  I got to tell ya, I was IN LOVE with that muffin.  It was made perfectly: an impressive amount of walnuts, dense, but still moist.. no overwhelming sugar ... and you can see little bits of zucchini in the bread.  The last time I had home made zucchini bread was when I was in middle school... many, many, many years ago and it always left an impression on me - this was the perfect way of reliving that.  It was outstanding!  I think I would go back just for that zucchini muffin.. seriously.  I liked the ambiance - very cozy and very neighborly.. lots of locals (students, too) studying, typing, surfing, working, reading, etc.

The relationship that USAirways and I have is that of a love-hate relationship.  I continually bitch about their tardiness for flights, their crappy in-flight service, their stinginess with things, and on and on and on I can go about how they suck in my book.  The problem is they almost ALWAYS have the cheapest airfare for my travel needs... not always, but almost always.  As such, I'm a rewards member with them and I (dare I call it love??) really like their low prices.  I have flown tons of times via USAirways for my Cali travel as well as other regions of the state, so this review is based on ALL my experience with USAirways, not one single horrible or one single awesome experience - they've all averaged to a solid 2 stars.  Frankly, if you can handle not so great and below-average flight experience (not many people can, but I have pretty good will power for short-duration flights), this is a good cheap option.

So my bff was in town and we decided to gather all of us college buddies and have a nice dinner at this place.  The website made it out to be an impressive establishment.  Not really, though.  it was a bit dead when we arrived that evening... no host to welcome us, no one to seat us until I almost had to walk to the kitchen to get some service.  When our whole party had arrived (~15 or so, which he was well aware of) our server still delayed in taking food/drink orders and refilling our cups.  When it came time for me to order, I had asked if I could modify one of their dishes (easy request: no cheese in the eggplant napoleon).. guess what?  yeah, it came out with cheese... all of it.  Oh and another thing - what place touts itself as 'new American cuisine' and then doesn't even carry sweetpot fries??  They only had regular frozen bag fries.. really?  This place was a disappointment in service, atmosphere, and food offerings.

I'm sorry, but if you want crappy quality paletas (fruit or fruit/cream bars) and or sugary "fruit" aguas frescas and or ice cream that has collected ice all week, you will enjoy this place.  I've been here twice now and both times left disappointed.  Their paletas, though they carry the name of coconut, strawberries, ect, barely even list some of the fruit on their ingredient list - essentially their flavoring comes from the last ingredient you will likely always find on their paletas: "artificial flavorings; artificial colors"  That is not what a paleta is about!  When my mom made us paletas as kids, she would use all fruit and milk ingredients.... Of course I'm comparing a home-made paleta to a factory-made paleta (see my Betty's review to understand how they make them right).  The ice cream, also colorful (probably with artificial flavors and colors) has had that freezer film on the top when I've ordered it and they are not even worth it.  Their aguas frescas are the same - sugary and have the hint of fruit in them but heavily rely on sugar to make you enjoy them.  I'm sorry, but me thinks not.  You're better off making your own aguas frescas (which, btw, is hella easy) and making your own paletas... or just going to Paletas Betty where she uses REAL fruit.

I really enjoy Guedo's Fish and Shrimp tacos - they come heavy with well-prepared (ie. not overcooked shrimp) ingredients and the sauce is soooo yummy.  I also like the salsa-bar they have chock full of radishes, cilantro, onions, and several types of salsas.  I enjoy the low-maintenance of this place, though sometimes it seems a little too low .. but, again, that is the atmosphere of this place, so it honestly doesn't keep me from returning.  Note, though, that some might consider his fish/shrimp tacos expensive (IMHO, shrimp shouldn't be priced like a 99c value meal.. it just isn't!... but that's just me!)  I like to hang out and wait for my food by the register because sometimes the cooks there sing along to the Mexican music and it's quite entertaining.    I wish this place got more business because it really seems like it has great food, but maybe the competition on AZ Ave with all the Mexican joints is too much... Every so often, I CRAVE their tacos, so I would say I'm a lite-regular.

I have been giving Brian my business for over many years now (since my first car!) and before that, it was family who had already had years of business before that.. so I can honestly say that I would hands-down recommend Brian for any automotive needs.    We've always had Hondas and that has always been what we've taken to Brian for either routine maintenance or if something has happened (or to get car vitals check if we're buying or selling a used car).   I recently recommended him to other family.  They have been praising him for saving them many hundreds of dollars on a repair (their other 'mechanic' had quoted and estimated initially) on a POS car they just use to commute.  They are now Brian converts :)  His shop is crazy messy and don't expect any kind of luxury looks or ambiance, but expect an expert - hard working, honest!!!, very kind, and straightforward business person.  I am a girl and not once has he needed to 'dumb' things down for me, he is very good at explaining what is wrong and how he is going to fix me.  My most memorable experience was when I was in college (and thus poor), I brought my Civic to him for an issue and though the dealer was going to charge me 130 for parts and labor, he instructed me to buy the part online ($20) and bring it to his shop and he'd show me how to do it myself to save in labor - that $130 problem became a $20 solution! WHO DOES THAT?  Brian is awesome in my book!

This place is one of my favorite places to eat at while in Tempe (sadly, I don't go that often since graduating from ASU).  I've eaten here many, many, many times so that tells you I'm a fan. I go back for the same reasons - very well made, great tasting N Indian dishes such as the Keema Mutter (ground lamb), Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, and their Gulab Jamun and rice pudding is super tasty.  I know how to enjoy this place without pigging out (1st round of proteins, 2nd round of vegetables, skip the bread and rice, 2 gulab and I'm set!), though I do leave quite full but not regretting it.  Their service is good and I've never had any server issues.. nor food issues, for that matter.  They are consistent in flavorful N Indian food and service (I went 2 weeks ago and was impressed with the fact that nothing had changed!) so that's why I'm a fan.

I have come to this store many times because it's a pillar of Mill Ave.. they've been here as long as I can remember and I've always known it for comfort, quality (note, not hip, sexy, and cheap) made shoes... so, for those looking for hip, sexy, cheap shoes.. not for you.  They do have some cute shoes that aren't 'granny' looking, but then again 'granny' may be all in the eye of the beholder.. at least for me, I have frequently seen cute shoes here that are usually over $80, so it's not like I buy gobs of them.  BUT, when my mother in law needed quality, comfortable, long-lasting shoes for her job, I found her the perfect pair here... not cheap, but I'm pretty confident her shoes will last her a long time considering the manufacturer and quality of the sole and leather.  Expensive, non stiletto-sexy girl shoes, but comfortable, quality-made shoes and personal customer service from this pillar of Mill Ave.. I'm a fan!

I can remember being a little kid and my mother *always* taking me and my sis to SAS (on Indian School Rd, that is) for her sewing supplies.. sis and I would play with all the oodles and oodles of things they carry: buttons, ribbons, patches, feathers, fabrics, and sequins galore!.  Needless to say, I definitely have lots of memories attached to SAS.  Mom is a wonderful seamstress and, yes, she did pass that on to me (check out my hubby's mended shorts and my home-made aprons and tailored blouses).  This SAS location is pretty much the same thing: gobs and gobs of fabrics, ribbons, buttons, patches, felt, feathers... if you can make clothing or accessories out of it, it is here.  Their pricing is the cheapest you'll find (always better than Joann's) and the sewing craft stuff is always cheaper than at Michael's.  Needless to say, their color, style, texture, and pattern selection is VAST.  The gals inside are nice and purchases are rung up old-school pen to paper (they do accept CCs).  I got a lot of fabric/felt/ribbon here for miscellaneous wedding and holiday decoration needs ... This is THE place to go for your fabric needs.

We went to celebrate a special occasion here.  My friend from work had highly recommended it for any type of special dinner, so my husband and I thought we'd try it.  I had passed this place many, many times while attending ASU and I had never one stepped foot in to it, but had always seen a great outdoor dining area always full of people that seemed to be enjoying what we now know is great cuisine!  We arrived for dinner without any reservations on a weekend and were seated within 5 or so minutes.  It was great weather, so we had ideal seating outside on the W side of the seating area.. lots of small faint lighting amongst a dark night, a perfect setting for an intimate dinner (though there were others around us not dining so intimately).    Our server was friendly, prompt, and gave us the full description of menu items, wines, etc.  I had an amazing lamb shank and my husband's game-meat was absolutely flavorful!  Every ingredient and combination seemed like it was well thought out and then executed by skilled cooks in to beautiful dishes that were both exciting and still recognizable.  There was this adorable (and I am certainly not a cat kinda gal) cat that kept brushing up against our legs.. I rubbed her belly a bit and found out she was the restaurant's pet.. kinda silly.. but sweet at the same time.  I recommend this place for great food and a nice, relaxing night atmosphere... I'm sure I will pick this place again for a future romantic affair.

This place is an institution... I used to come here back when I was a poor Sun Devil student.  They make the burgers right in front of you on a pulley-system charcoal grill.. and you can notice that in the flavor of the patty.  Plus, they make their patties in varying weight sizes (1/3#, 1/2#, etc) so you can get as much or as little as you want.  The very flattened patty is placed on the grill and I think this is perfect for cooking quickly and safely.. also, moisture is still maintained in the patty since it's not overcooked (what you do when you have thicker patties).  They have pretty typical greasy sides.. fries.. fried zucchini.. onion rings.. it's all good standard grease-stop fare.  I wouldn't at all say this is the cleanest-looking nor the most modern (cash only) or well-maintained burger joint.. but I will say that if you want a no-thrills damn tasty burger, you should give this place a shot.    I went a couple of nights ago and it sure hasn't changed in the past 7 years... nor has it probably changed in the last 10 years :P  I did, though, really enjoy my 1/3# burger.. cooked to order, simple bun with onions, mayo and ketchup - delish!

I've been to this location numerous times..   One of the recent times I went, I had a Groupon (yeah, I was pretty stoked about that).  We ran in to a big problem when, even after confirming it over the phone, my sister and I arrived for dinner and the waiter told us he couldn't honor it because it was a special weekend (..mind you we had already been seated and ordered a glass of wine).  When we replied that it had already been OKed over the phone, we also asked what was special about that night as there had been no mention of it over the phone, he said there was a big event going on nearby... yeah? really?  where??? where the eff were they eating cuz it sure wasn't busy there??  The place was NOT packed and frankly, I think it was super crappy to say one thing over the phone and then try to reject my Groupon when I get there.  I'm not usually a biatch when it comes to stuff like this.. I typically try to be understanding (at least I think I am)... But this time I was piiiisssed.  I don't live in the area so I had to drive a good 30 min to get there and then battle stupid Mill Ave traffic to try and find a decent spot to park... add to that that I even called ahead and inquired (like the Groupon tells you to do so) about using it that weekend and had confirmed it.  OK, so I explained all this to him and he got his Manager, who told me again that it was a misunderstanding and that she couldn't honor it.  I took a deep breath and explained it again to her: "been a long time customer.. travelled far.. confirmed it over the phone.. ridiculous and pretentious of them.. I want my $ back because I didn't expect this from an establishment like theirs.. I expected it from Sizzler or Chili's, but not them" and my sister and I were about to walk out (of course after laying cash down for our wines) when she said okay, they'd honor it.  The server was actually very nice the whole night after this (he was nice from the beginning.. I think he personally felt embarrassed that I had to go through this and had to fight them on this), and it seemed that he felt bad for what happened and tried to make up for it by great service and even great conversation.  Anyway... that night, I remember specifically, we had great Pinots and the squid ink pasta with octopus was phenomenal!  My sisters dish was also fantastic.  Since that time, I've gone back a few more times and have, again, had excellent dishes with great service.  Their wine selection is refreshing and their staff seems to know what they're saying and take the time to give you good, knowledgeable service and food advice.  So besides the little Groupon bump in the road, I'd say they are a great establishment. If they hadn't fought me on the Groupon, you bet I would've given them 1 more star .. but the fact that she finally let me use it AND we've had a superb meal every time (plus the waiter service was great) makes it a 4 star place for now.

Stopped by here with my mom and my toddler for lunch after playing at the Kiwanis Park.  The walk up order process was super duper quick and the staff was very nice and seemed like they enjoyed their job (a big plus), but the food was sub-par (in every way... margarine??? yuuk!) and not anything I'd ever spend my money on again. My mom and I both had different plates and we both tried each others and were just not impressed. For my BBQ needs, I'll stick to Joe's in Gilbert, this place is not interesting enough and bland for me.

I hit this place on my way home from Yoga a few times a week... the things that stand out about this location are:  - staff is *super* friendly and helpful - the kind I'm not used to seeing at a grocery store  The stuff that is general about all TJs is that I also like their TJ-branded products: frozen calamari, breads, cereals, trail mixes, etc.    I wouldn't stop shopping at my other go-to spots, but for quick on-the-go pickups for last minute things I need before heading home from Yoga, it's pretty good: good variation in selection, competitive prices, convenient packaging, quick shopping... friendly staff.

My husband was eating here, I swear, at least 1x a week with this soccer buddies.. he'd always come home and tell me about the awesome ceviche, tacos de marlin, and tacos de governador, and mojarra frita he had there.  So we all went with the in-laws in tow to have lunch there one Sat afternoon.  I had the tacos de marlin and everyone else ordered the vast list of things my hubby recommended.  Let's just say no one at our table was complaining nor disappointed - everyone polished off the food and the ones who couldn't, well, it's only because the mojarra was so huge.  Since I only tried the tacos de marlin and liked them, those are the only ones I can personally say were yummy.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was plentiful and very, very flavorful.  We did, however, get seated in their back section.. squeezed up against another large family which was a bit annoying since there were 2 huge tables in the main area that said 'reserved' on them (but we noted no one actually ever sat there).  I'd go back again if I got the craving for it...   btw, it's located in a strip-mall and sorta hard to find if you don't know where to look...

We had a group lunch today here and I was quite impressed with their service.  Our party of 13 was quickly seated and our server gal was quick, friendly, and did an outstanding job of taking care of us.  Our food did take a while to come out, but I do believe that is expected when a party of 13 orders and backs up the kitchen.  The atmosphere is a typical BBQ lunch place; lotsa chotchkies on the wall;  I do like that they have a hand washing station stationed right smack in the dining area - I was able to quickly wash before and after my tasty BBQ meal (lotsa sticky fingers); they also are generous with big bottles of about 5 different BBQ sauces on the table as well s giant rolls of brown paper towels (smart!).  I ordered the two types of chikens they had on their lunch menu and for $9 I got a whole lotta chicken.  It was smoked and tasty and my side of broccoli was cooked well (not over steamed).  I am not a big fan of their BBQ sauces because they taste *really* sweet, but a little here and there was enjoyable.  I think it is a great spot for a group lunch - we were seated quickly, served appropriately, had a filling meal, it was a good value, and easy with separate checks.

We took my brother out for father's day here to Cibo this Sat night.  Our party of six had called to be put on the list and when we arrived, our table was ready for us... AND it was crowded and busy, so I'm very impressed that despite the busy evening, they were able to get our call-in table ready for us.  There are SO many reviews, I will just give you a few tidbits that stood out to me: - there is no chicken on the menu, so if you're going to order a salad, forget chicken.. you'll get prosciutto or sausage but no chicken... but their Omero Salad was *outstanding*.. delicious and so flavorful and great mix of textures and flavors - place is adorable, small and intimate.. and at a 100 years old, there's no sound absorption.. my cackles were resounding... I had to purposely laugh softly (very hard for me!)... FYI - you can do half-half pizza orders...  I tried a slice of all the 5 pizzas at our table and found them all unique, flavorful, and definitely delicious - their Il Tagliere meat and cheese board is a fantastic appetizer idea.. burrata was outstanding and loved by all  We would absolutely come here again!

Walked in and ordered the Grilled Vegetable Salad with extra green veggies and the gal taking the order was friendly, prompt and my to-go container came out within 10min with a *crap* load of veggies - seriously awesome that they were not meager or stingy with those portions.  The green salad portion was small, but since I got lot of sauteed greens, I was more than full with that.  The ambiance is nice inside... I like it much better than the Ray/Dobson ambiance. This place has much more open seating and, like the Ray/Dobson location, a nice outdoor seating area (but in the front).  Actually, as I parked the car, I was thinking this place was going to be packed.. when I walked in, realized the patio was busy because no one was really seated inside - duh, April! the weather is perfect for outdoor dining these days!  Food was plentiful and delish, staff was friendly and quick, ambiance was nice yet casual - I'd come back if ever in the neighborhood.

After many times of going here (and then later regretting it due to the surge of burping that goes on and on for the rest of the day), I still don't get it...  I don't get their special ordering process.. I don't get the whole Mexican/Asian food mixture 'coolness'.. I don't get that nasty cookie that leaves a layer of lard on the roof of my mouth..  I just don't get what others see in it...  Their dishes are decent but there's always something too strong in any one of them that makes them hell for my body to digest (hence the never ending burps).... their black beans are too sweet.. Jade Chicken is too spicy.. Machaca is too salty or overly seasoned... Let's just say I've tried many combinations (yes only because my coworkers seem to find this place highly enjoyable and I go along for the team-spirit.. pfffff... yah) to find something that doesn't have such an effect on me and I'm still not sold.  I do have to say their staff has always been nice and friendly... sadly, that doesn't trump taste in this case.  Their ordering process is a huge PITA - I usually just tell the girl the 2 or 3 things I want and don't even bother 'learning' their whole 'ordering process' -{cough}stupid{cough}.  Also the layout there is oddddd.... lots of empty space and foldable plastic Rubbermaid tables and chairs makes it seem very 'thrown together'.  Sorry, but I'm just not a fan.

My bff and I decided to have a whole day of pampering and because this spa has a sauna and a steam room (apparently, the Scottsdale one doesn't), we decided for this location.  We arrived around 10 and were immediately greeted and treated very well.. whisked away to the Lady's room where we were offered a tour of the amenities (sauna, steam room, hot tub, pool, etc...).  The main vanity area was well-equipped with things like hair dryer, combs, slippers, lotions, etc, but according to my friend, it was under-par to the Vegas spa amenities she had previously.  I got a facial and the gal was really nice and very educational and gentle with me.  She was not overly talkative (like I prefer) and let me zone out to fully relax.  I had Corazon for a seaweed wrap and really enjoyed that, also.  Cora was friendly and not overly talkative and let me relax as well.  The facilities were very nice (though sub-par to Vegas spas) and the personnel were always friendly and accommodating.  I liked the healthy snacks they had (apples) and the lemon water, too.  I did spend a pretty penny here.. but hell, we were there from 10am till 4pm, using all the amenities, so that was worth it.  According to my friend, we paid just slightly less for our services than what she paid at this other high-end spa outside of Vegas.. so maybe it was relatively appropriate (the amenities and such) for the price.  I'd come back again, but not before I'd try other spas to get a flavor for what is good and what is great.

Went here on a recent Saturday afternoon with some family while we were in the area.  I had looked for a local sandwich shop on yelp and was pleased to have  found this spot... hell, it was close enough, so we gave it a shot.  The buildling is an old gas station I've driven by many times before ... never would I have thought that it would be creatively converted into a small sandwich and coffee shop... but I'm glad it did!  The small outdoor patio had a few people there (and some pets) and the indoor seating area was small but empty enough that we found quick seating.  The table/chairs were a bit awkward (a bit wobbly), but we made do.  We all had sandwiches (I the Curried Chicken Sandwich - how have I not had this before, it was outstanding in flavor!! and my sister's whose sam'ich I also tried was the Deviled Egg - also delicious) and afterwards we decided that, with the unique selection of alternative-ingredient baked goods they had on display, we'd try a few out.    When we had first walked in, this girl's big, FAT delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye.. and after lusting after it throughout my meal, I decided I'd go back to the walk-up counter and get us one to split... waa!  They were all out!  Bummer... BUT, we tried their spice cake and their danish and they were excellent.  I will be back again for sure!

I gotta tell you - for a bachelorette party, this is THE place to go.  My bf's bachelorette party was held here after dinner and, at first, I was a little bit worried I'd experience the same crap as Axis/Radius for my last friend's bachelorette party (I was hard of hearing for the next full day and the crowd was so lame, I just wanted to sit on the side and count how many girls looked like 'ladies of the night') but to my pleasant surprise, this place totally impressed me!  Here is why:  Disclaimer: I am a happily married straight gal, LOVE to dance techno 1- the crowd was 80% gay men, which was perfect since it meant I wasn't going to get dumb guys trying to hit on me (hello! don't you see my shiny ring AND the fact that I'm NOT dressed like a 'lady of the night' trying to get your attention) or trying to literally pull me away from my friends to dance (freak) with them.  2- the gals that were there were gay/tran/etc and not the prostitute-looking, dumb 'barely dressed' broads (as typical of lots of Scottsdale clubs) you have to deal with that take up room on the dance floor and aren't even dancing (they're just standing there trying to look hot).  3- the bartender dudes were awesome - friendly, generous with the many shots we bought and I NEVER had to 'wait' for the bartender or try to get his attention - they were very attentive and actually friendly!  ALSO, their drinks were strong! not watered down.  4- the atmosphere is fun - the place is a bit dark and dive-y looking inside (and out), but once you get the music going and the crowd thickens up, it is fun!  Also, a major thing to me - the music was perfectly amplified such that my ears were not ringing even though I was on the dance floor all night.  Also the club patrons were not like the A/R patrons.. friendlier, fun to dance with, cuter boys!  Also, since it was a bachelorette party, a lot of the gay men there were kind enough to buy the bride plenty of drinks and even take her out for plenty of dancing.  5- the owner came by and offered our bride-to-be an oh-so-sexy dance with 2 of the better looking go-go dancer dudes (I thought that was cool of the owner to set up).  I don't even club but I'd say that if I am ever invited to go clubbing again in Scottsdale, I am all for visiting this gay club!   The only down sides:  The bathroom line was rediculously long.. outdoor 'patio' is kinda slummy.

I'm a fan... for several reasons.  You can find practically everything/anything you need for your house here.. my favorite is the kitchen stuff, the organizing options, and the basic shelves/bookcases.  Things are very affordable and stylish... not saying that it'll last you forever, but I think what they're going for is to be affordable and stylish.  The store itself is a PITA to go to.. it's a freaking maze (but if you're a bit sharp, you learn the trick and you can navigate it quickly and without touring the whole damn place).. the parking lot is *always* packed (good luck finding a close spot) and those damn carts are a total annoyance (they glide in every direction, except straight).  The staff has always been good - nothing awesome and nothing terrible.  You want a cheap meal? go upstairs... even their longest line moves quickly.. and they have good healthier options (smoked salmon, nice green salad).  As far as assembling their products.. well, I have done shelves, cabinets, tables, etc and can't think of any one time uttering "g*%#@&!^ Ikea!!" while assembling things.. so I guess that's good.

This place is absolutely hands-down the only place I buy my spices... been a convert since I found out Alton Brown uses their spices (plus my coworker wouldn't stop about their Cinnamon.. or as he called it "the real cinnamon".. cuz apparently the kind I used to buy in stale McCormick bottles at Fry's was crap).  And if you are wondering - yes, you CAN taste the difference with Penzey's variety of cinnamon and a standard grocery store generic cinnamon.. worlds diffrerent.  Anyway.  I really love shopping at this place - it's well laid out and they have just about every essence, spice, herb, mixture that you would want for baking, cooking, etc.  They have all kinds of sizes so that if you want to just try a bit out, you can buy a 3 dollar bottle of it and not break your wallet.  They also have bigger sizes in case you have already tried it and can't get enough (ie. that's who I feel about their Adobo and Lamb Seasoning).  The staff is always friendly and able to help you with finding things or just getting recipe ideas.  Another thing I love about this store is that I get lots and lots of useful coupons in my catalog.  If they send me a coupon, you bet your butt I'm using it... and usually grab a few more things while I'm there using it.  They know their strategy works on me.  Like today, went in, spent $10, had a $5 off when you spend $10 + another coupon for free cinnamon blend.. walked out with a $5 tab and 4 containers of goodies!  That's pretty sweet.  Give it a shot for your next baking adventure or to mix up your recipes a bit...

LOVE coming here... even when I don't plan on buying a book I'm always ready to walk out with a few - their prices are competitive and they have such a great selection for being a used/new bookstore that is not a chain.    The best part (well, for me) is the front are with all those really cool and unique gift items.  I swear, I can find a gift for just about anyone in this section... there is so much creativity in the items they carry.  Staff here is also friendly, helpful, and informative.  This is just a gem and I hope it will always stay like this.

With so many great reviews, you know you've chosen well if you planned on dining here.    My family and I have been frequenting Joe's for several years now and, for my money, you can't get better quality, 'made-with-love' BBQ than Joe's Real BBQ.  Their food has always been fresh, flavorful, plentiful, and priced affordably.  Their staff are the same: super friendly, genuine, prompt, and I've never had a bad experience with staff (in fact Management has always been flexible and helpful.. say when we had a birthday cake we asked them to store for us... stopping by to say hi to customers).    This place is cafeteria style, so you get your food, pay, sit down and enjoy.. that simple.  Some of my favorite things to get: - Brisket, Pulled Pork - you can't go wrong with this flavorful, moist meat that is slow-cooked over pecan-wood... I can literally eat 3/4lbs of it! - SWEET POTATOES!  I *love* the cinnamon/sugar butter they serve with the giant, loaf-sized sweet potato (only offered during the sweet potato season).. I will usually order the sweet potato and this alone. They are giant and cooked perfectly and very enjoyable and filling! - Sides of: Cowboy Beans (YUM!), Mac n Cheese (YUMMIER!).. I don't really venture outside of those 2 sides because once you know 'good', you stick with 'good'.  I have yet to try their root beer and their desserts, but I can imagine they are both very tasty given than everything else has been enjoyable.  OK, the *only* con: The line can get pretty long during 'popular hours', but good thing it runs fairly quick; Their salad sans meat is more white/yellow than green romaine and it's just a little on the boring side.  But to be completely honest, you should not be going here for a salad, you should go for the BBQ.  With that, it still ranks high on my list of places I enjoy eating at.

ugh.. not impressed.  I absolutely dislike when companies claim "natural" and "safe" ingredients yet have done no basic research on the ingredients they claim are natural and up the price on their goods for those who don't know enough to do their own research and don't know they're buying the same unsafe products.  OKAY, don't hate me, because I know there are SERIOUS devotees to Lush.  Good for you.  Don't get me wrong, I am willing to spend good money on good products when I have confirmed they are indeed "good products".. so I'm not a "hater".  I'm just a factualist... if that word even exists.  Take for example their soaps and shampoos and lotions which contain several ingredients that are known to be harmful.. I won't go through those ingredients here as I don't have the space, but I just want to mention it so you are informed of the "natural" products your paying a premium for that aren't so natural or safe.  If you want to read more, google search it.... it'll open your eyes.  Interesting to note their website no longer contains a link to their ingredients..   Okay, so now that I've explained why I give them low stars for advertising quality at a premium when in fact it isn't... I'll comment on the rest of the store and services.    Stars diminish for: Staff personnel were very pushy to me and my sister the whole time.. she never left our side and kept pushing us to try this and that out and even applying samples to us.. we seriously turned around a few times to lose her but she kept coming back... she also didn't even know any answers to the questions we had about the ingredients, so she deferred to her boss who told us that, yes, parabens and SLS was safe and so was FDA food colors in their soaps and shampoos... umm, yeah, obviously any research on that will show you that clearly is not the case.  alright.. now for the good...I do have to admit that they DID have *some* clean and very safe products... a lot of them had simple and natural ingredients that, if you do a query, are not unsafe and used by a lot of pharmaceutical grade naturopathic companies.  THOSE I will buy and will gladly pay for...  they did have some freshly made cleansers they kept in a fridge that had some very raw and natural ingredients... I think I would try those products for sure.

Stopped by after lunch with my buddy.. the place was empty except for us and the guy behind the counter was very helpful, friendly, and patient with our NUMEROUS tastings.. and he did it with a smile :)  TONS of flavors.. too many to list, but I liked the 'death by chocolate' (at least that's what they should call it!) and so many others I can't remember.. what's there NOT to like about Gelato??  4ish dollars for a small .. you can add 2 flavors to the small... there ya go!  I'd come again :)

This is actually a pretty nice park.  I was here recently for a birthday party on a Sunday and was impressed to see the expansive park, plenty of close parking, a nice water feature in the center, and plenty of shaded areas both for sitting or for laying down in the 'arizona' grass.  I think this is a nice addition and nice feature to the S Phx/Laveen area and I hope they continue the maintenance of this place because it is an attractive place to get together with family and enjoy the few cool months we have left.

So we just finished dinner at Roy's for Restaurant Week and I must say it was quite impressive.  We're not accustomed to eating out so 'finely' on a week night, but this has been a rough week for dear hubby of mine and I wanted to treat him tonight.  We showed up a bit early before our reservation, so we sat at the bar and were tended by a couple of lovely gals.  I had a very delish grapefruit martini and he a Jameson... then we were taken to our table and commenced the 'feeding process'.  WOW, it's been over an hour since we ate and I'm still 'stuffed to the brim'!  Their portions were very impressive:  Appetizer: I had the Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Roll appetizer, he hadthe Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs - consensus: roll was outstanding, accompanied by a fantastic buttery miso; ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor coating was finger-licking yumminess.  Main Course: I had the Mac Nut Mahi Mahi and he had the Beef Short Ribs.. again, flavorful!  Mahi Mahi is a little too dry for me (it was cooked more rare, which should have helped this already dry meat) and besides the Lobster essence, there wasn't that much excitement going on.. no spark, no za-zamm...(BTW, HUGE portion on the Mahi Mahi).. his short ribs were scrumptious, especially with that braising sauce to smear it with... his dish was way better than my dish. Dessert:  We tried both the Souffle and Cheesecake.. the cheesecake BY FAR outdid the Souffle.  The Souffle was just too rich and too chocolatey... unbearably so!  but the cheesecake was creamy, slightly rich but well balanced with the fats in the crumb base... ugh, so good!  Overall we enjoyed it!  Service was great and I appreciated that Roy's participated in Restaurant Week and had such impressive dishes and delivered on all ends (well, except as noted).

I'm a regular at this mall.  It has a good balance of clientele that is neither overly-trendy nor extremely ghetto.. just right in the middle.  They have all the major department stores that I frequent and the smaller stores I am a fan of (ie. Sephora, Aveda, NY&Co)...  After all these years of shopping here, I have finally found the best spot to park so that I have no (very little) car or pedestrian traffic to deal with - it makes going to the mall super easy for me.  My only complaint is that THEY CLOSE AT 6PM on Sundays.  I have been there on Sundays near 6pm and it is not empty at all, in fact there are a lot of ppl still shopping and ultimately complaining as they're being shoved out of the smaller stores so they can exit the mall.... I think they should re-evaluate their hours and move that 6 to 8pm.  I appreciate the fact that at Nordstroms, last time at 6pm, their staff never even insinuated we should wrap it up or leave (they close at 6pm, too)... good for them, we both bought shoes there and it was already 6:30pm when we checked out.

I really appreciate mouth-blown glass art work (Chihuly fan since high school!) and so the first time I walked in here, I was wanting to take everything home with me - the colors, the shapes, the ingenuity in many of the work they carry here is so captivating.  I have found great looking pieces here for very affordable prices (the latter not often the case with glass) - beautiful glasses, creative tumblers, unique gifts.  The walls are covered with sets of pieces and then they have plenty of one-off creations - vases, platters, bowls, etc.  Their sales staff are friendly and helpful with questions and not bothersome nor pushy.

I don't go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area and I want a walk up, order, meal (no waiter) without really waiting, I stop by. They have pictures of all their dishes, which all are pretty standard, but I still appreciate the pictures as they help me decide.. .nothing fancy or too unique, but everything I've ordered is tasty.   The last time i had lunch here with my toddler, we got the Honey Mustard Club on Ciabatta and we both enjoyed every bite! It was very tasty and id definitely get it again another time. I also tried their house made pastry, of which they have a big display of. It was the walnut danish. ..that was actually really really delicious flaky, moist, chock full of walnuts and cinnamon. ..i think I'd actually now go out of my way to get one again.   The place isn't really enticing to foodies, it offers pretty standard sandwiches/breakfast, but tasty ... ive never seen it full or busy except once but i will continue to come here as long as the people are nice (which they've always been!)and the plates are good and desserts are displayed ;)

I was a HUGE DD's fan all through college.. frequenting their ASU location at least 2x a week and always ordering the saaaame damn thing (the Dilly's Dilly).  Lately, since I cook at home more, I am not a frequent customer.. however, on those occasions where I'm craving a Dilly's Dilly (not on the menu, but still order-able: turkey, sprouts, bacon, avocado, minus the catalina sauce), I like to get my fill at this location.  So today I decided to venture out of my comfot zone.... yes, after YEARS of ordering the same exact sandwich I decided to try one called the Babaloo (ham, pulled pork, cheese, pickles and spicy mustard)... damn it!  I should have stuck to what I know! I found this sandwich to be boring in flavor and so blah, I barely noticed there was anything besides the blah sourdough... sooo disappointing!  This is the ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 - because this was a huge disappointment to me after many years of consistently great Dilly's Dilly, they had to kill my adventurous spirit...  I guess I know now to stick to my usual and not to venture out.. that's not really a good opinion to have of a sandwich joint, but sadly it's the one I have right now of DDs.   Besides that, the service and staff is always fast, seating is easy, and their salads are colorful and fresh-tasting.

So I am an occasional shopper here at this market.. for a few reasons: we love their in-house made corn tortillas; they have a good selection of mexican treats (Bimbo breads and coconut bars) and if I'm buying conventional produce, their prices can't be beat.  Also, their pan Bolillo is really good and cheap and their cakes (3 Leches) are pretty damn good.  OK, so here is where the minus comes in.. the BIG minus. My husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast (I'd usually order simple, straightforward things like carne asada tacos.. don't get much simpler than meat in a corn tortilla).. well, the last time we did this, I found my meat... ready?... wait for it... to be the color blue and purple.  I had brown meat, but I had pieces of it that were blue and purple... no effin' joke.  I thought it was a trick of the eye, but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff, that shit was blue and purple.  I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side.  That being said, I've also become more cautious in buying meats here... not to sound like a snob, but you bet I'm not buying my next cut of beef here!  I'm cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and such, but if it comes to meat, I'm out the door.  I much prefer Pro's Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market.

I was glad to find another dim-sum place in this area because the one we used to frequent of the same name (minus "Buffet") closed down on Ray and Dobson.   We walked in on a weekday afternoon for dim-sum lunch and were quickly seated.  The ladies were quick with stopping by with carts of little stainless-steel containers.  They popped the top off and would say what they were (of course she could've said "fried donkey ears" in Chinese and I would'n't have known the difference)... my friend and I tried maybe 4 or 5 little dim-sum plates plus noodles for my friend and the bill was... gasp... 12 dollars total - yeah, SUPER cheap!   I don't know what good or bad dim-sum is, but I know that this was filling, flavorful, priced well and when I googled what I ate later that night, my pics looked the same as those online.  Note that there was definitely a language barrier, but be patient.. they offer good service and you're definitely being served by hard-working staff.  I would return for dim-sum again here.

me likey Costco!  I recently found out that we spent almost 4K there last year alone!  Holy cow!  What the hell did we buy??  Okay, actually it was the furniture and the bed and tires and food and the list goes on... so I recently upgraded to Executive to see if that pays off with a year-end percentage cash-back of this year's spending (fingers crossed!)... yeah, I know that means I would have to spend more.. but it's nice that they carry a lot of what I buy regularly: Organic eggs and Organic produce, big ol crates of berries, TP, various environmentally-friendly household cleaners, etc... and gum!  God knows I love my gum!  They also now carry Wild Planet Albacore Tuna!  Same can but waaay cheaper in bulk than Whole Foods - yay!  I find the best time to shop is .. there is no best time.. it is a busy place but since I'm not buying for an army (yet), I don't have a problem running in, grabbing my stuff (maybe do a little window shopping in the kitchen appliance or jewelry section) and getting out quickly using that cool little digital scanner checkout they have only at this place - yay!   Parking sucks.. be ready to walk... oh and receipt review line can be long, so don't put your receipt away too soon.

I really liked visiting Bookmans.. crazily enough, I've never been here before!  I enjoyed their store and cafe, though I was disappointed that their cafe employees TOTALLY forgot about my latte :(.  No big deal, but hopefully when I return again, this isn't repeated.  The cafe is great for just chilling with a book and a drink/sandwich, or surfing on your laptop, or, like us: great for boardgames! They have a VAST selection of THINGS at this place - VHS, DVDs, books, CDs, board games, video games.. the list goes on!  I would shop here just to get away from the big-box stores like B&N, etc.

I have really enjoyed banking at Chase and think their Customer Service is great.    Any of the times I've needed to come in for various in-person tasks, their bankers have been friendly and quick to provide you with service.  The first time I went in to open my account, I was attended by this super cool gal and we chatted it up for a good while after talking account stuff and then realizing we had quite a bit in common.  Most recently when hubby and I went in for another in-person task, their banker, a latin gentleman (from the same country as my parents) attended us very well - we also ended up chatting it up for a bit after we all realized we had a lot in common.  I can honestly say these two people I point out here could easily be cool and good friends.  I guess all that goes to make you feel like they hire people like "you and I" and so that is comforting when you are giving Chase your business and your time.  Plus this place is convenient - ATM is never packed and you're always in and out.

I'm a HUGE fan of Nordstrom Rack.  Their staff is professional, friendly, and always pleased to help you and serve you - this is based on numerous times going there and them helping me do shoe hunts (that when you find the one R shoe in a size bigger/small you like and then hunt around for the anothe R shoe should be somewhere in your size throughtout all the racks because the kind lady found the L shoe in your size in the back.. and she's helping you out).. or them still being patient and kind with you as those in your shopping party are gazing at nail polish trying to decide on a color when it's past 9pm and they're already closing!    Their clothing selection is awesome!  I have found awesome going out dresses, work pants, gym clothes, sweaters, etc... for not-cheap, but respectable prices (hey, they're not Ross, so get over it).  I also have bought nice jewelry and glasses and purses there ate a considerable markdown and still leather, or a nice fashionable name brand.  They have a clean store, friendly staff, frequent spottings of clearance shoe/clothing racks AND they have this nifty debit card you can get (not a credit card) that earns you points for using it there.. I'm not THAT big of a shopaholic to require one, but if you're gonna shop there frequently, might as well earn points (and cash) while doing it.  Oh yeah and returning stuff there is a cinch!

Been to Blossom a few times now - first time so that Kate could do my hair and the other times just to shop.  I *totally* like the atmosphere there - it's laid back, casual, and most importantly, boutique-ie without the big price tag (actually prices were quite reasonable).    Kate B did my hair and I loved it, she was friendly but not in a 'fake' 'trying-to-make-small-talk-to-pass-the-time' way, and that always works for me.  She did exactly what I asked of her.    The other time I was in there it was for a gift.. and I spent a lot of time browsing because they had SO many options.. and since the prices were good, I bought something for myself that I always get compliments on (a green coin purse with a big fabric flower on it).  I also like that they have local designers and such, though I wish some of their purses weren't 'made in china'.  If I'm in the downtown Mesa area (which isn't very often), I like to stop by and just browse to see what new stuff they have.

This place is evil.. I could literally walk in and not come out until 2 hours later.. and several dollars lighter (hey, at least I didn't say several hundred dollars lighter).  I say this because they have SO MUCH home/kitchen decorating/tools stuff here you get swallowed or engulfed in all the stuff they have in stock!  It's esentially a TJMaxx for the house/kitchen but with lots of unique or one-off decoratives.  I have bought a lot of my house decoratives/kitchen gadgets and gifts at this place - you can't beat their prices AND the fact that they have tons of name-brand, high-quality products (Kitchen stuff mostly).  I have gone here some times just to window shop or to paruse or get ideas for my next home decorating project.  I love this store!  It is well stocked, well organized and if you're looking to populate your house or kitchen with needed tools or decoratives at affordable prices, this is the place to go.

I found this bakery through the Farmer's Market and fell in l.o.v.e with their Dakota Bread - it has everything I love about sliced bread - dense, tons of seeds, perfectly absorbs butter, and perfectly accompanies any deli meat or PB&J.  I was impressed with their customer service recently.  I saw them at the Gilbert Farmer's Market and bought a Gluten-free loaf from the young gal and guy there.  I took it home, totally excited to slice it up (it wasn't sliced) and make yummy toast or a sandwich from it.  I had recently converted to Rudi's GF bread (find it at Sprouts) which is awesome.. so I was expecting the same experience with this new Great Hearvest GF bread.  Turns out, something in their recipe was waaay off.  I opened the cellophane wrapped GF loaf and it completely broke apart with a touch of a finger.. it seemed that something didn't bind or keep things together in the mix.  I contacted the owner (I got their business card at the Farmer's Mkt by chance) and very politely told her my experience.. that I was a long time fan.. loved their products..very saddened to have it crumble...  She replied to my email and was SO kind and apologetic about the whole thing.  She offered me to come in or find them next time at the market to get a refund or exchange it (no need to bring in the bad loaf)... she was going to let her staff know so that I wouldn't have to struggle with an explanation for why I was asking for a swap or refund if she weren't there.  I was impressed with that!  I love it when an owner takes care of customers and make sure their product isn't leaving a bad or negative impression.. granted, it's up to you as the consumer to give them the opportunity to fix it (like I did in an email, rather than ranting here on Yelp.. which we all may or may not be guilty off.. errrr.. ).  Anyway, I hope to try their little shop next time.. but so far, this bread company is up there on my list of favorites.

Never a bad experience here.  Garden people have always been helpul and have given me good recommendations for what I wanted to plan; Paint guys have always been helpful, patient, and work quickly, even on Sat mornings!; Check-out people are friendly and quick; Overall staff is always helpful (then again, it could be because I'm a gal and they probably think I'm helpless and don't  know what a #10 bolt is or how to install a toilet.. anywayssss)  We have bought a lot of things from HD - floor tile, lawn care, appliances, tools, lighting, plants.. so many things.  We go here because it's competitively priced, true to their DIY roots (for the most part) and their staff is great.  Side Note: Sat mornings/afternoons in the Paint Dept is quite busy, so plan on getting in early or doing some other shopping while your bucket is color matched, shaken and stirred!

I've been seeing Dr. Swan since 2012 when I had my first child. I have never had such personal and attentive care from a medical provider.  Within an hour of meeting her to determine if she'd be our midwife, we were completely sold and have never regretted it 2+ yrs later. She is up front and honest about things and I've never had my questions go un answered and any concern has been met with validity and respect. I find it strange the one star review about her treating patients like that. ..I've NEVER EVER felt that way, then again, i prefer honest,  up front providers, and plus my family is pretty holistic and i do tend to agree with her recommendations (because they've always worked!!!) so maybe if you don't trust her expertise or don't follow a holistic, natural lifestyle, you'll probably disagree with her and feel she's one star worthy. .but please don't think she is anything as described. I've never felt disrespected nor insulted. ..  She is not only my midwife but my son's pediatrician and my PCP. ..i trust her entirely.  Fast forward to 3 ys later and I'm still seeing her for my 2nd pregnancy. She not only takes care of me when I'm not pg, but of my son and all his well visits. She even takes care of my husband. We have FULL MEDICAL insurance my hubby gets through work, yet we get all our medical care needs from her paid cash and not through our insurance... I think that says a lot about a provider: that families are willing to forgo their insurance they already pay for to get care from someone worth the time and money.

Review is based on phone order and pickup.  I got off my plane after a 12hr day on planes and in airports and was craving a thin-crust pizza .. only because Grimaldi's was so conveniently advertised on the display board above the Alaskan Air baggage carousel :)  Talk about great advertising.. it sure hooked me!  Anyway, we did a phone order for a small pizza that was half Pesto chicken (for me)  and half marinara (for hubby) with other toppings of his choice.  The gal said 40min from the time of our call and, sure enough, 40min later, our food was ready.  My husband liked the ambiance inside while he waited for it to be ready... and for a moment there he wanted to change the request to eat-in so we could enjoy a drink with our pizza i their nice restaurant... but I had just flown in to town and was dead tired... so, we just took it home.  It was delicious!  I really thoroughly enjoyed the pesto chicken... lots of chicken, tons of pesto (my fave!!) and white onions...he polished off his half without a blink.  I left one slice for breakfast the next day and it tasted just as good re-heated.  I would definitely go there for thin-crust pizza cravings in the future.. maybe not that often since it was a pretty pricey pie ($30), but good for an occasional indulgence out.

Places like this are a great concept: If you're being food-conscious and on the go and need a quick protein option that doesn't involve requesting all sorts of adjustments ("hold the sauce, grilled only, no butter"), this place is ideal.  I walked in between a wedding ceremony and a reception that was going to involve lots of stuff I can't eat this particular week, was greeted by a friendly guy manning the place.  Told him I just needed something to hold me until we survived the reception and made our way home.    For $4ish bucks, I got a huge cup of ~25g of protein - exactly what I was looking for: whey isolate, vanilla, water-based, NOT sweetened (though they do have that option), to go...YO HO!  IN and OUT of there I was.  Now I need to find one near my area.

I was very glad to have flown to Indiana via this airport.  I arrived early (with no real need to) just so I could have lunch there, but the lines for check-in and security were rediculously short.. I'm talking 1 person in front and 2 people behind me!  Gotta love that!  Get ready to pay extra for ANYTHING possible... next time they'll be charging you for bathrooms on the plane, I swear!  I had one carry-on that was 'below seat' size, so I paid no fees.  I tell you, for flying to Indiana, you can't beat the fare I got (apparently I can't quote it here but it was the lowest.. trust me).  I reviewed their restaurant there, which was a great treat for such a little, simple aiport.  Airport staff were friendly.. bathrooms were clean.. no lines, no crowds, no stress, no worries.  Also, if you're looking for a quick bite to eat on the plane, they have more than just bags of processed snacks and nuts.. they had these yummy chicken pesto pitas near the gates.. that, and fruit.  Not bad... I'd fly through here again.

So my sister introduced me to this place more specifically their home-made beef jerky.  It has no preservatives and is pretty low in sodium and I've had it many times now (the girl is whack, she buys it by the pound and snacks on it all week long).  We went together tonight to stock up again and I was impressed by their amazing selection of meats - like Tarrah C. said, it is a "meat lovers dream"!    I buy a lot of fresh meat, mostly lamb, goat, bison, and on occasion, reindeer (though that is usually frozen)... this place had, as far as I could tell - all of that.. though it was in the frozen form.  They had a lot of pre-seasoned meat in the meat-counter (non frozen, obviously) that would make dinner easy to execute.  ONE THING, however, is that I asked about natural, grass-fed beef and they do not carry that.. bummer... hopefully with enough demand, they will someday soon carry it.. as now even Super Target carries grass-fed beef!  I made a mental list of all I will get here after my current supply of lamb and reindeer are out: oxtails!  more lamb cuts (bigger ones than the little shoulders I buy).  I saw the oxtails in the frozen section and once I finalize my plan on how I'm going to make them (we had a lot of oxtail soup in Spain and we loved it!), I'm gonna hit this place up.  So far, I am a fan...

I have enjoyed this place several times and I'll tell you why: ingredients taste fresh and inventive combinations exist throughout.  They are generous with portions and the setting is relaxed, family-oriented, but still interesting and very tasty food options that go beyond your typical burger and hot dog.  I've had the breakfast Fontina burger and was in gooey-fat heaven, the banana pudding, the double dogs (in natural casings!), the Ahi Tuna salad (so amazing!).  The bathroom is the ultimate weirdness experience, but you gotta try it!  I like going here with friends or family for breakfast or for lunch (only been to dinner time once) and it is such a nice view of a great big tree, a garden and farm property.  I look forward to eating at this place.

My BFF arranged for some girlfriends and I to take a class prior to the evening that was my Bachelorette Party - I gotta say that it was a blast!    Very memorable!!... memorable because apparently we all have a little sex-kitten-walk hidden in us... memorable because strapping on some 6" heels and straddling a pole brings out the inner-skank in us.  In short, whatever it evokes in you, know that *something will* be evoked!  This is the chance for you to be in a private atmosphere (it was just a few of us girls and one instructor girl and plenty of poles) and learn some sexy moves that I'd honestly say have lots of 'perks' to their use.  The facility is a bit hidden on this strip-mall.. enter in and don't expect to be overwhelmed with modernness and sexiness: it's an older building with a check-in counter and a class room setting in the back with an iPod speaker and plenty of poles and mirrors and class-lighting.  Make sure you get the clean pole ;)  What stands out is the instructors, their friendliness and the entertainment you are about to have.  The shoe selection was kinda tossed around and some of them looked beat-up and after grabbing a sexy 6" red pair (with good size straps), we all tip-toed over to the back room.  Class was long enough for us to all practice and then do solos to some Gaga (which, btw, don't let your MOH video! - major blackmail!).  They had catalogs of these totally hot, sexy shoes (not for walking the mall, but for walking the pole) in case you were wanting to take home a 'starter-kit'.  Like Hillary P. says: awesome workout, increased awareness of the way I move, and a happy husband (AND wife!).. need I say more??

This is, hands-down, my favorite place to celebrate St. Patty... except for this year, it's been a tradition for the co-workers and me to spend St. Patty's afternoon there... so bummed this year it fell on a Sat and I didn't have the usual crew around to continue our tradition.  I have also gone numerous times on non-event days and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere, pub food, bar staff and especially the booze.  Service at the tables is usually a bit slow, which is why I always know to order my James & Ginge Ale at the bar (tab open) and leave the meal order to my server.  Bar staff is attentive and, even when they're hella busy, they'll get you your drink quickly without the griping.  The atmosphere is totally casual and seating used to be a major biatch until they opened up the back part a year or two ago... now, that area has more darts and pool tables for your boozing and socializing needs.  Note that the patio gets full of smokers (if you don't care for that sort of air), so FYI.  I've eaten their flatbreads, their Shepherd's Pie and plenty of their Fish and I think their food is pretty damn tasty pub fare... to hell with the calories, I LOVE that fish!

This mall has always been enjoyable to me and I was so glad that Tempe finally had a spot for shopping that wasn't a snobby Scottsdale mall or a ghetto Tempe Outlet Mall (like AZ Mills).  I honestly don't usually come here to necessarily shop, but I do enjoy walking it and window shopping and people watching.  If I do shop while I'm there, it's because I see something I like, not because I purposely went there to buy something... though I usually always shop at the stores outside the mall (ie. Penzey's, World Market, RoadRunners, etc) and I do have to admit the mall itself has a crap-load of selection for whatever type of shopping you want to do.  The walk around the mall is great and perfectly shaded most of the time and when it's hot, they have misters and outdoors music that is calming enough to not notice the 100+ degree weather.  I really, really like their sitting spots - comfy couches and sectionals for hanging out.. reading, etc and heaters or fireplaces for when it's cold (or misters and fountains for when it's hot) and a good, relaxed yet lively ambiance around you.  There's a theater, so that's another plus and they have a decent selection of places to eat (I like the Irish pub and CPK).  I'm SO glad that there aren't any Tempe Trash (as I affectionately call the homeless college dropouts that litter Mill Ave's walking areas) at the mall.. I'm glad the mall has sufficient security to keep them out because you bet I'd stay away like I stay away from Mill Ave.

Went here last night for a very late night dinner.  Who knew people still went out after 11pm for drinks and dinner in Chandler!  I feel like I've turned in to a fuddy-duddy... home by 7, in bed by 9 - what have I become!?!  Well we had just finished watching our friend's trapeze performance nearby and this was one of the few places that said it was open till 2am in Chandler... so here we came at about 10pm... had to wait a few minutes to get patio seating.  I can't believe they were that busy.  Gawd, I'm old... and slightly lame.  Anywhooo... my friend from work, a bit of a beer snob, had told me that if I wanted to enjoy their beers, I should try the Epi-Devil (50/50 Epicenter & Devil's Ale), so I did.  Everyone else got Devil's Ale and the Pineapple Hefe... mine, by far, was the most well-rounded, palatable beer... my friend was right, the 50/50 mix helps tame the hop-piness of Devil's Ale and I really enjoyed my beer.  I got the Chandler Street Tacos and did enjoy the filling, just not the lame flour tortilla.  You'd think that street tacos was not a neighborhood staple.. I mean, come on, we're on Arizona Ave, well known for all it's Mexican food joints and plenty of taco stands and you serve so-called street tacos with FLOUR tortillas?  Really?  Anyway, if they had done corn tortillas, I'd given the tacos alone 5 stars because they were pretty damn yummy... 4 star tacos for using flour tortillas.  Oh yeah and the beans were not tasty at all.. and hubby's tortilla soup was downright gross.. but his Pulled Pork Sandwich was very good.  So.. I guess they are more successful with their main dishes and their sides are just 'no bueno'.  Service was excellent - cute server gal, quick, friendly, did her job well.  The atmosphere was alive, energetic, young, but well-balanced with some older folks and some young'ns.  A bit loud, but then again, it is a bar..   I'd come back again for an Epi-Devil and try some burgers, after all, I did enjoy the meats and flavors.. Mohammad N. really does describe their burgers quite well and I'd love to try one of them.

I love shopping at Whole Foods - the overall experience is great.  Anytime I've bought produce, I've found odd fruits/vegetables in their display that I've taken home and really enjoyed. (last time was the Buddha's Hand).  I've eaten at almost all their eating places (the Smoke House - GREAT burgers and fries, the Beer/Wine has great selection, the salad bar always has a variety of salad toppings - organic, too! - and their hot food bar is always pretty inventive with a few great typicals).  I've always noticed their staff is friendly and caring and I've never had a 'bad' staff experience.  I love how they always offer you complimentary ice (this is super helpful esp during the summer) for your grocery bags.  Returning things here has always been easy (even produce - my Cuties were a bit rancid). Their Whole Body area has tons of options that I'm still going through.  Finally, their Cafe/Juice bar, which I just tried most recently was super impressive - I've been juicing a ton lately and for less than 7 dollars, I got a big juice chock full of all their greens, ginger, beets, carrots - literally a lunch in itself.  I will be going back for juices during those times I am running late and just need a juice to hold me... pricey, but well worth it when it has so many nutrients.

I was in the downtown Chandler area this afternoon for the Farmer's Market and stepped in to this place for some tea and maybe some dinner.  As I perused their entree menu, I was not really excited about anything except maybe the mac n cheese.. but since I didn't want to overdo it (I saw their amazing display of desserts) with my meal and have no room for dessert, I just ordered an appetizer.  I ordered the Caprese which was moz and tomato with pesto and balsamic drizzled.. it was tasty, but not mind-blowing.  I tried their double-chocolate mate tea and, just as promised, it was chocolatey smelling and was actually enjoyable.  I finally got around to their dessert display and after asking what they all contained, I ordered the Pyramid with Pecans, Caramel, Mousse, and Chocolate... WOW - it was outstanding!  Not rich, not excessively sweet, just an ideal balance of all the ingredients into a very satisfying dessert.  The staff was great, too - the young gal with the glasses was friendly, helpful and quick.  The guy that was in the back prepping the dishes was also friendly and asked how we were and if we were enjoying our dish.  I am giving them 4 stars for having outstanding dessert, great service, and very enjoyable tea selection.. I will come back to get more tea and more pyramids.

Definitely hipster... trendy.... good lattes?  Hell yeah!!  Walked in today and ordered a hot small (still a double shot) latte with half&half... the first sip really blew me away!  Can't say I've had one this good since this little cafe in Cordoba, Spain.  The gal at the register was friendly and helped me pick between half&half and soymilk..   I liked their simple syrup pump... didn't like that they had no cinnamon/nutmeg shakers because I love that in my lattes.. but glad I didn't pervert what is to be (so far) the best US latte I've ever had.  Damn, I wish I lived closer.  Place was hard to find and, yeah, no prices... and if you're not a hipster, you really do get noticed and stand out.

This is a great B&N (I'm a nooker!) - they are obviously well-stocked with books of every sort.. anything you could basically want to read about.  Plus when I take my nook, I can sit and read here for hours whatever book they carry on the shelves... pretty sweet.  The parking is easy if you park right outside of the B&N (which we did) and don't want to trek the whole mall just to get there.    I was impressed with their kid's section.  We took the kiddies here for reading time and there were SO MANY books and types of books that my nieces and nephews were entertained (quietly, too!) for at least an hour and a half.  LOTS of Star Wars books as well as other educational topics for kids.  Their seating area for kids was perfect, too: little kids ottomans, lego tables, train tables as well as reading tables with lots of little wooden chairs.    They have a Starbucks, but as I previously reviewed, be aware they DO NOT ACCEPT GOLD CARDS or any SB cards... not cool, man!

I like coming here - they have great portions on salads and are super generous with the meat (I'm not exaggerating either).  Their Greek salad always has plenty of crispy, green romaine and is topped with a lot of fresh color veggies, olives and a nice amount of feta.  Trust me, a big Greek salad here is VERY filling.  I have not tried their pitas, but I have tried their Kefta and I like that the guy makes it fresh (ie. he tells me it'll be a few minutes of wait because he's making them fresh) - which I appreciate.  The price point is perfect for a regular lunch spot, too.  My ONLY complaint is that when I have gotten the salad, I have gotten the pita bread slices that come with it and maybe I'm just not used to that type of pita bread, but it's kinda 'americanized'.. very non-nutritious looking.  But that could be just me.  I guess I'm used to the ones from Haji Baba that you can actually slice open and stuff.. they're more fibrous and seem to have more nutritional value.  Other than that, I will always stand by their salads.

I am a fan.. yes, right on my first visit and I have become a fan.  First, the young guys running the register and food area were both courteous and prompt.  My order for a gyro sandwich (to-go) was put together as soon as I ordered pretty much in front of my eyes.  The sandwich was ridiculously huge.. I mean, the meat was falling out of the 9-10" well-toasted/warm pita.  It had onions, the white sauce (tzatziki) and huge chunks of gyro meat.. the meat was flavorful, plentiful, and moist.  I've had plenty of gyro sandwiches in NY, Detroit, Phoenix and this one was really moist.  I will absolutely come here again.  The price was right, the portion was generous, and it was convenient and friendly.

I'm a fan of this place because: - their staff does their job: they are nice, greet you, and keep the place in tip-top cleanliness state and all machines are operational (meaning they up-keep well) - their classes vary and they have a convenient schedule of different types of classes - it is a modern, clean facility; has an indoor running track and plenty of new machines that have their own TVs with cable; also have a lot of machines and a great selection of free weights for those of us that prefer free weights over cable machines.

We've celebrated a couple of romantic occasions at this venue and have had, both times, an outstanding experience.    When you first walk in, there is an amazing tall wall of beautifully showcased wines - all kinds.  The last time we were there, as we both stood there waiting for our table to be ready (1-3min), I noticed they had Qupe wine from the Santa Maria Valley... one single bottle that immediately caught my eye - oooheee!  I had done wine tasting at Qupe Tasting Room in Los Olivos, CA recently (and brought home some bottles) and seeing they had a bottle there at Cork was super exciting!  Yes, we got that (~$40).  The ambiance is very nice.. modern, upscale, without being super pretentious (okay, it can be a tad pretenOur server was one of those over-the-top cheery, smiley, happy people (meh, I prefer a more real, less exaggerated server but she did her job well, so no harm).. our orders came out as requested and the kitchen delivered impressively!  We had such amazing dinners: lamb chops cooked perfectly (even with a little crispiness on the outside), Roasted Duck Breast, Pork Belly, and salads.  The bill was a bit hefty, but what the hey, it's not our anniversary every day!    The wine, the ambiance, the service, the FOOD - we had a wonderful and memorable dinner here.  If you're looking for an intimate place for you and your loved one to enjoy imaginative and well executed meals.. and enjoy them with an array of wine options.. and don't mind paying for it, I highly recommend this place.

Second time I've been to this location.  I generally go to the Dobson/Ray location, which I greatly enjoy.  This place plain.. how do i put it... sucked.  We had nice patio seating, around 7pm, three of us girlfriends.  Our server took forever to get us our drinks to the point we had to go up to the bar after a while to get them ourselves.  Then before our food came out, we were told one of the things I ordered was out: (Kafta Burger was out prior to me ordering it) cauliflower, so now I had to get something I'd never had before: Spinach Lavosh Quesadilla.  OK, fine.  My spinach lavosh thing was a gross combo but I was hungry, so I ate it.  The spinach was a terrible ingredient in this combo, I think Arugula would've tasted better or even basil.  My friends Gambas were tiny and the sauce was below-par (she also usually orders this at the Ray/Dobson location... flop.  Our drinks were correct but the table next to us (who were there for a birthday) got their drinks and their food all screwed up, plus really late.  They complained and got helped by a guy... we didn't complain as we figured they'd covered our concerns already.  It is terrible planning when a restaurant like this doesn't have things off the menu.. it's frustrating to keep ordering and keep being told they're out.  Get your stuff together, folks!

I like this for a lunch spot - they've got tasty options ... AND, guess what?  They have LAMB WEDNESDAYS!  I Looove Lamb!!  Their lambrurger is awesome; their lamb chops are great (just order them cooked med rare, trust me) and it's just nice to have a place that offers tasty lamb dishes close to work and for a special price (on Wed's).  I have tried a few other things here and they were tasty, but I stick to my lamb.  The ambiance is nice, relaxed, and darker inside - but still bright enough for a 'business lunch' (ie. it's not "romantic" dark).  They also have outdoor seating area, which is great when weather is nice.  Staff has always been nice, no complaints there.

They tend to have a great selection of conventionally grown produce (and, no, it's not really a farmer's market.. I wish!).  Their organic produce selection has grown in the past 5 years that I've been shopping here, so I think they'll only grow more with time.  They now at least have a section dedicated to O produce so you don't have to hunt around for it.  On Wednesdays, they have double-dip days.. meaning that the previous week's ads and the upcoming week's ads are active on the same day - double the deals!  Their meat section is decent - they always carry Organic beef and Organic chicken, and they have Lamb usually and Bison on occasion.  Of course conventional pork, beef, chicken, etc are always there.   I would have to say the biggest pluses to this place are their bulk items - everything form choc chips to almond flour.. trail mixes... legumes... all kinds of nuts.. baking flours and even alternative snacks (apricots, dried currants, etc).  The other plus is the Vitamin section - TONS and TONS of options for all kinds of supplements, herbs, vitamins, whatever.. it's a great place to get cosmetics, too as they carry all the Alba, Avalon, Burts, Toms, etc.  Occasionally they have the 25% off days for anything in the VItamins/Supplements area or from the Bulk section..  I go crazy up in this place stocking up!  Their wine selection is actually very nice for a grocery their size.  They tend to carry small batch vineyards at times and that's nice to grab on occasion. .

So I've eaten here before for lunch and decided to stop by again to get what dish I always think back to... their amazing couscous.    I showed up around 11am this Saturday and luckily there was no line as this is a popular place around lunch.  The staff looked like they were barely getting set-up for the day, so I took my time scanning the menu for what else I was going to eat that would accompany that amazing coucous I still recall.... turns out, they don't make it anymore.  WHAT A BUMMER!  I had been looking forward to it so much that when I didn't see it on their menu, I was secretly praying they called it something else besides couscous.  Oh well, whaddya do?  So I got the raspberry, goat cheese w/ pecan salad; side of chicken breast (for protein), and a small container of roasted sweet potatoes.    My reviews: Chicken breast: very good.  Lightly flavored w herbs, and freshly cooked (it was not overcooked) and sliced for me to eat with my salad; Salad: very tasty combinations.  I loved that they were plentiful w/ the raspberries and the pecans.. the jicama was a nice muted contrast to the sweetness of the candied pecans and the tartness of the raspberries.. lettuce was fresh... and cheese was very plentiful.  Kudos to them for being generous with good ingredients. Roasted SweetPot salad: one word: addicting.  It is a perfectly balanced mix of chili oil (I think), scallions, roasted and gently sweet sweet potatoes, and dried cranberries that together make up a very flavorful and intriguing mix that is very exciting to the palate. Note that this sweetpot dish reminded me a lot of Liberty Market's sweetpot dish... though I liked this one more.. can't figure out what ingredient differs, but this one was at the addiction-level and it wasn't the sugar.  I wish they still had that amazing couscous, though..

I have eaten here a few times and I have to say I love their juice bar options.  Sasha is awesome in that she knows the particular things that particular people like.. ie, she has an array of smoothie add-ins (wheatgrass, veggie protein, etc).  I would say the only complaint is that both times I've ordered to-go here, it's taken forever (even for a smoothie).. so I've resorted to just calling way ahead.  Her sandwiches are big and are wholesome and have interesting mixes and only once have I had an issue (I had expired carrots), but that was just once and the other times I've had no issue.  I've seen her with farmer's market bags of produce, so I know she gets her produce as local as possible.  The decor is very relaxing and invites you to hang out a bit longer.  A few times she's been in the kitchen running her mixer and pops out with some dessert topping or filling she's making that she'd like us to try and tell her what we think of them - they've always been good.. especially because she has to be creative to make them vegan and tasty.  Her to-go containers are all compostable and she is very cautious about re-use in her dining utensils (ie. no styrofoam or plastic cutlery).  I support this establishment because they are commited to whole food, customer satisfaction, and the environment... and she makes Hella good desserts, smoothies, and big yummy sandwiches.

bottom line: Mexican bakery with a huge selection of mexican 'pan dulce' (sweet breads)... things run around .70 and up, depending on complexity.  Their cochinitos are what I get... and their conchas are super fluffy inside and beat any Pro's Ranch Market conchas!

Woodlands is one of my favorite places to grab lunch. I first learned about it from a fellow Indian coworker who was vegetarian and that was the only place he frequented.    It's a pretty plain joint (not too big on the decorations, you'll note), but the food is outstandingly flavorful.  Now don't be fooled and think that just because it's vegetarian that it is going to be completely 'healthy'... that is a very common mis-conception and can really eff up your 'diet' if you have that mindset and eat at places like this frequently.. cuz I tell ya, they are pretty generous with not only the portions, but to give food some sustenance, you can bet they use cream or ghee (basically butter) to thicken sauces up and the likes.  This food is flavorful, for sure, but low in calories it is not.  I have tried a few of their Thalis (basically sampler dishes which lets you try a variety of things in one sitting and in smaller portions, but still really filling), the Palak Paneer, the Currys, the Aubergine dish called Bharwan Baiga, Gobi Manchuria.. they were all super delicious... though the Aubergine dish is still my favorite!  Plan on taking leftovers... oh yeah, and the prices are pretty decent and the staff is pretty good, too.

A friend and I went for lunch today to Gingerroot.  They had what looked like a buffet but they called it 'combination' (means it is not all-u-can-eat), though you could do the a-la-carte menu.  They had about 7 options at the buffet-looking counter - all contained 'meat' (shrimp, pork, chicken, fish, etc).  I had the Laing (coconut milk w/ shrimp and taro leaves w/ pork bits) and the Chicken Adobo.  The lady (maybe the owner) was very friendly and was very welcoming and even gave us little plates to sample whatever we wanted to sample before we ordered - that was really helpful!  I absolutely LOVED my chicken adobo - it had so much flavor that I found myself sucking on the chicken fat just to get more of that flavoring.  Sadly, after I devoured the chicken, I started on the Laing and found I could not stomach it....at alllll.  I drank some water and gave it another shot.. nope, not going down.  I think it was the stark flavor difference between the chicken and the Laing that made my nostrils pick up something in the Laing that just did not appeal to me.. maybe it was the fishyness of the shrimp, or maybe the slight tang/bitterness of the taro leaves... or the smell of pork fat mixed with coconut milk.... not sure, but when I taste-tested it earlier, i was excited to eat it... after the chicken, I couldn't even smell it .. something was so off-putting.  How odd is that?  Anyway, i can't hold that against them - I approved it after tasting it at first... I guess something was obviously off with me.  The bill was cheap (7ish or so for me) .. and I took a Turon to go (banana/jackfruit/wrapped in rice paper and fried to a crips/topped with browned sugar) ... so yummy!  I would return becuase the service was great - friendly, not stingey with portions (generous), educational, genuine; and the chicken was stellar.. plus the other dish my friend got was also super tasty.. so I know there's more there I could definitely try next time.

I was very excited to do my first CSA and now I'm hooked!  I love the weekly door-front delivery of fresh, local, pesticide-free greens (and not so greens like citrus, etc) which means my grocery/farmers market trips are less and so is the bill.  Since the beginning of January, we've gotten fresh and great tasting vegetables and I like being introduced to a variety of greens because I love learning a new recipe for a new ingredient (it was my first time using Kohlrabi).  I read another's review and have to say I have not had any bad experience with food being 'past it's prime' or slimy or anything (sorry about that Jennifer H.).  The deliveryies have been prompt and I like that everything is packaged and washed for me - basically ready to go.  I have the full share right now and plan on renewing for the next season for another full share.. the summer survivor season is exciting - I love all the stuff they'll be harvesting those months.  I recommend people give it a shot because you'll definitely be eating your veggies more often.

Big fan of this place.. the location is convenient for before yoga class nearby.  Their staff has always been friendly and prompt and I like their proximity to the bookstore (which makes me come even more often as I can browse and eat while I kill time before yoga class).  Wildflower has good food overall, so that's a known already... but what stands out about this place is the book store next door and the casualness and openness of the restaurant.

Despite being in Chandler, this is a bit of a drive for us, but we occasionally get a craving for their delicious sandwiches, so we have made the drive several times now, most recently last night.  It's a deli, so it's got pic-nic style tables inside, farm-decorations, and brighter lighting (If you want more intimate setting, go to Poppy's next door, which is their lounge and where they also serve food and have a wine bar).  I ordered the Cuban sandwich which is stuffed with delicious shredded pork, ham, and this perfectly melted and yummy cheese .. all on a ciabatta bread.  Hubby got the Roast Beef sandwich on baguette..  I didn't get a chance to taste his, but it was huge, lots of ingredients and he definitely enjoyed it a lot.  I loved the flavors on the sandwich and, quite honestly, think this is one of the top pork sandwiches I've ever had... I think the bread complimented it perfectly.  The side of cole-slaw, to me, was a bit boring and tasted more like the pico-de-gallo-ish bruschetta topping they serve with all that onion flavor; Hubby's side of pasta salad, crazily enough, also had the same pico-de-gallo flavor.  I guess they re-use ingredients in as many dishes as possible... that's fine, it just didn't entice me.  Service was quick - as soon as we sat ourselves, our guy (shaved head) was there, quick, friendly in a sort-of-serious kind of way... food came out quickly.  I will absolutely come back for more Cuban sandwiches.. though I should branch out and try some other ones.  Also, they make home-made ice cream and the flavors sounded quite unique and enticing (balsamic vinegar??).. but I was already carb-loaded with the sandwich bread that I skipped it... maybe next time ;)

I hadn't been here in years but recently went with my sister for brunch. We sat outside and our service gal was great: friendly, quick and good with recommendations.   I had the BLT crepe (everything else seemed like a bit boring) and it was well made but nothing "craveable" or really memorable. ..i sort of wish they had a more adventurous savory crepe menu. ..buuut, they don't. Oh well. .maybe I'll stick to the sweet crepes next time. I'm not expecting Crepe Bar level adventurous, just something different instead of typical sandwich ingredients inside a crepe... like maybe one of Goat cheese topped with walnut halves and prosciutto... that's different, right? Cuz most of these combos i could just get at a paradise bakery-like chain place. Their crepe batter itself is good, a good foundation, that is.   The iced Toddy was very very enjoyable and i chugged that baby down quickly. .. What they make, they make well; their service was great and i enjoyed my house drink..so this is a 3.75 star place :)

This place was a great surprise yesterday.  We rarely venture in to downtown Phx but we had movie plans at Filmbar, so hubby and I showed up ~6ish for Fri night dinner just before the movie.  Our server was this tall guy that was pleasant and welcoming, though not in that fake 'smile-and-kiss-your-butt-for-a-good-tip' kind of way (hubby hates the over-the-top cheery friendliness - think Brian the Chotckie's employee from Office Space) - in short, we liked our waiter - friendly, educational, and prompt.. oh yeah, and he didn't bug or interrupt us with 'anyone water water?' annoying-ness ..   On to the next: atmosphere. Atmosphere here is really great - they had a DJ playing some swanky, lounge, electronica that went perfectly with the place and the mood; good sounds, nice dark interior with a few soft and bright colors from lotus lampshades, etc; the interior works really well.  Food!  Can't forget the food! Duck Salad - a yummy crispy cabbage salad with cold duck meat slices in sweet, spicy vin - then topped with crispy garlic and peanuts - oooH!! Gyoza Soup - OMG we wanted more! they burst in your mouth deliciously and the little detail of ginger slice attached to the bottom brings a whole different layer of enjoyment to these dumplings. Bacon Lychee - We wanted more! The coupling of savory and sweet was outstanding, esp the crispy and fattiness of the bacon melding with the sweetness of the lychee... sooo good! Almond Fish - it was ok, I enjoyed the previous 3 more. Korean Short Rip - again, it was ok, but didn't stand out like the top 3.  Drinks: - My husband liked his Bombay Gin Dry Martini.. said it was made very well - I really liked my saketini - Jasmine infused Vodka with Sake and grapefruit juice was perfectly flavorful and not sweet like other soft pink drinks.  Overall - it was a perfect 'date' night for us - great ambiance and music, wonderful foods and great waitstaff... and good drinks to top it off.

Have enjoyed every dish I've ordered ..been here at least 3 times (and once to the Scottsdale Quarter location) and have, each time, ordered something different (so many intriguing options I can't help it but want to try a new thing! PLUS, they change their menu items with a few staples that remain unchanged).    I've never tried their pizzas, but I can attest to their salads and sandwiches and entrees - the one that stands out the most is their Sashimi Tuna which was surprisingly filling (the fat of the fish and avocado) and not-surprisingly, very full of flavor and my favorite, ginger.  Their Steak Tacos were also fantastic and I love the cotija cheese they put on top and of course my other fave, avocado.  Their price point is competitive considering they serve premium ingredients and the food has never disappointed.  Also, servers are (cute enough), wearing matching capris and such and have always been friendly, down to earth, and prompt.  I enjoyed the outdoor patio that the Scottsdale Quarter location has better than the Biltmore's, but this place is still very enjoyable... I just hate the parking dilemma since it's so popular on a any night of the week.

Pho Chandler is a great lunch spot.  The nice thing about this joint is that it is purely run by Vietnamese and that most of the clientele here is also Vietnamese.. that speaks to me sometimes more than any reviews!  I have tried almost all the Phos here but the one Pho I prefer is their spicy seafood (though not too spicy)... I've even ordered it to go and the portions are still huge!  I love the basil and the other veggies they pack your to-go bag with (and give you as a side with your meal).  I always use every single bit of them in my Pho.  The staff is great here - the little tiny gal is super friendly and always makes a point to ask how I'm doing and how is work and how is my husband, etc.. I don't think she honestly remembers all the details of her customers but I like that she's kind enough to ask and look like she cares about you... i'm a sucker, I know.  But her customer service skills are great.  Oh yeah, the vietnamese coffee is super sweet and addicting.. I've had it a few times and I have to say that I prefer to share it with someone out of guilt of the caloric density of all that condensed milk.. but anyway, it's yum!!

I can't believe I haven't written a review for our night out here.  We had a blast!  A small group of couple-friends from work and us went on a Friday after work.. it wasn't busy busy yet, so we had our pick of the tables and we had a great, comfortable spot once it did get really busy that night.  The ambiance and decor is a bit cooky mixed with modern sleek.  Our server gal was impressive - she was engaging, genuinely friendly, knowledgeable about the beers and quick with service.  We ordered the Bar Plate with lost of different things on there that was enough for all of us.. there were three different pizzas on the table that we ordered and they were all delicious in their own right (yes, I tried 'em all!).  I really liked that the crust was thin and still chewy and crispy at the same time.  The beet salad also looked delicious from across the table.  What stood out for me was, of course, their passion for cocktails.  I loved that I wanted to try every drink on their menu... well, we practically did.  At our table was Chimay, Huckleberry Lemonade, Classic Manhattan, ... and, of course a couple different types of Absinthe (Mata Hari and Grant Absente) and my Yellow 80 proof Chartreuse.  Great cocktails, is all I can say!  Great ambiance, cool decor, friendly and quick staff, tasty pizzas and a covetable bar menu and you got me at hello.

The short story on F&E and why I shop here:  - I can be in and out (when I have my checklist) in less than 10min, no lines, ever! - Open 8am-10pm, so I can go before work or after work and again, no lines - free food tasting in case you're hungry and want to munch on something while you shop - carry these "Eat Well" options that have salmon and veggies and aren't carb loaded - quick lunch spot - "Friends" reward card is easy to earn points and redeem them for grocery credit - their staff is helpful but not annoying - have quite a bit of options and variety considering it's a small grocery space - clearance aisle is kick butt and offers great savings

This was a neat find - it is right off the I-10 and is literally a side-bar to a building that contains PeiWei which is directly under SideBar.  We arrived on a Fri evening and there was good music, fairly loud for a place described as a 'lounge'.  The music was appropriate for the dark, almost club-like setting with lounge seats and a colorful bar backdrop... it was just loud.  Also, the loudness of the music was not what we were looking for.  The bartenders seemed busy but we got great service.  The gal, after I asked if she could make a grapefruit martini, delivered what had to be the *best* grapefruit martinin I've ever tasted.  I could immediately tell that they fresh-squeeze their fruit juices as mine had bits of grapefruit pulp which I REALLY LOVED... it was a bit on the sweeter side, but it was flavorful and strong.  The crowd was typical downtown phx trendy..  I'm a fan of their drinks (well, the one that I tried).. and I'd be open to coming back again for any other situation now that I know what to expect.

I enjoy this Farmer's Market for a few businesses whose products I enjoy: - Horny Toad: this lady is a real farmer; no frills, just great pesticide-free, local veggies and fruits and she's actually NICE and great to talk to; I love her selection of heirloom tomatoes and her kids are a welcome sight (they actually are well-behaved and seem to be very helpful in her farm productivity) - Crows Dairy: they are from Buckeye and have great tasting goat cheese from their Nubian goats. - Circle Key Farms: they have excellent goat (and beef, etc) selection and the guys that run it are great to talk to and learn more about goats.. which I LOOOVE! - FIshhugger: I like talking to these folks as they are very educational and I have become a convert of their honey selection.  I also get my fish from there. - Alaskan Pride Seafood: I like these guys because they do the fishing for the fish you buy (all Alaskan Wild caught) and their selection is always great. I get my fish here also. - Red Mountain Cattle Co: I like to get Ground Beef from these folks, thought haven't because we are eating more lamb and goat these days.  I've bought from a ton of other vendors there (salsa, pita chips, hummus, oils, facial cremes, eggs, melons, etc), but these are the ones I go out of my way to buy from.

Morning staff was very friendly; They made me the poppy-citrus chicken salad for me to-go and it was bursting with berries and with pecans and lots of chicken - way to go!  It was really filling (tho not cheap!) and I'm glad I stopped by... PLUS, I get to earn my points on my frequent-eater card :P  I recommend this place in Term 2 for food.

I have to say that I really felt like I was taking a risk going there for lunch.  First off, I heard a lot of negative things: long lunch, slow service, dirty place, smells when you walk in, dingy servers and food preppers.. though I don't recall any "food sucks" comments, which is exactly why I took the "risk" of having lunch there.  My comments on the so-called negative things others pointed out: -long lunch/slow service: Yes, this was not a short lunch .. but it was also not a long lunch.  Food took a bit long but we also were expecting 'custom-baked' pasty.  Plus our server was quick enough to bring us drinks and my soup order, etc to hold us over;  Our server guy was outstanding - friendly in a genuine way, prompt, kept checking on us, and had very good customer service skills (I'll get to that later). -dirty place: Yes, as I mentioned, it needs a good cleaning (those pew cushions were nasty and the wax should be scraped off and menus cleaned up) -smells: Yes, but we deduced it was the cabbage. -dingy servers/food preppers: It's an 'alternative' type of staff.. I myself am not that alternative, but I have no issues if my servers look like Cheba Hut or Pita Jungle employees :) As long as they are clean with handling my food (at least, that I notice).  I did note, however one of the food preppers talking on his cell phone while he was handling food.. I thought that was gross (god knows where cell phones hang out and all the dingy dialing we do).  OK, so now to the food: I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie - both were delicious!  I was super impressed with the breadth of the pasty 'stuffings' and got very excited to see they had over 40 options!  I want to go back and try them all.  The yogurt served with my tikka was perfect.. the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned.  Essentially, their fillings are both inventive, somewhat unique and really entice me to come back.  Plus, I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish (meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone).  Bottome line: Yes, there is a distinctly strong smell when you walk in ...yes, the pews had dirty cushions on them.. the candle wax was all over the table/menus, the menus had other grime on there.. honestly this place REALLY needs to quit the slacking and clean this place up... BUT, their pastys were yummy and their service was excellent - 2 major players in making me want to come back.  Okay, so now to the note about customer service: I found a piece of red thick rubber-band (~1" long) in my soup .. we could only assume, due to it's color and size, it was the ones used to bunch up produce (It was a leek-potato, stilton soup).  Yeah, not excited about that find, but I did appreciate that when I mentioned it to our server, he swiftly took it away (offered me a new one) and immediately apologized and said it was 'on the house'.  THAT is fixing a problem immediately and correctly - kudos for him for a great response and showing good customer service.  I can understand that 'shit happens' sometimes but it's the aftermath of how you treat the customer that found the rubber band in their soup that matters.  I'll be back!

This is based on customer service for returns.  I bought a nice NF jacket here and, obviously, dropped a pretty penny on it (I'll say!).. only to be on work travel in Cali (where I really needed it) and have the zipper come out (made in China or what?).  I was seriously peeved: I have bought lots of non-name-brand sweaters and jackets before and *never* have those $30 jackets had a zipper come out!!... to add to that pissed feeling, I'm thinking Dick's won't exchange it because it's been well over 30 days.    ahh... sigh of relief.    I called this Tempe location to inquire about the exchange (citing the date of purchase and the cause of wanting to exchange it) and the gal on the phone (I imagine the manager) was SUPER nice and understanding - she told me she hates when that happens and that, of course they'd exchange it and to come on in and she'd take care of it for me.  So, I did and got a new jacket (I did check it for zipper quality, hopefully that screening was good enough)!    A+ for customer service on returns with receipts over 30 days!

I get the warm fuzzies entering Macy's... maybe it's the whole association with holidays and warmth and comfort (Macy's Day Parade attachment).  PLUS they carry Martha Stewart home goods (of which I'm a big fan) and I've never NOT seen a sale going on for shoes, clothes, jewelry... you name it.  I have bought so many things here as either gifts or for personal use, you can say I am pretty loyal.  Their shoe staff is helpful and will even look up shoes for you off the clearance rack (most store staff don't even care what you think if you're buying off the clearance rack) to see if another size/color is at another store.  I would say the only department they lack in is the Lingerie department... tried to find wedding lingerie for a friend and Dillard's had much better selection and variety.

Hubby and I are pretty satisfied with the food we've been getting from this place.  It just about one of the only 'delivery/take-out/dine-in' fast chinese food place in this part of town, so we were hesitant it would be any good.. .turns out it is!  We've had it in the past (like over 4 years ago) but I can't say I recall how it was but recently were craving chinese food delivery and got it already a few times in the past 3 weeks and I gotta say that it is top of our list for to-go/delivery food.  Here's what I've ordered: "Weight Watchers" - aka steamed - veggies and shrimp and was impressed with the soft shrimp (not over-cooked) and the bright, fresh-tasting and crispy broccoli and other veggies... plus the portion was huuuuge.   Hubby had a pork dish (don't recall) but he really enjoyed it and neither of us had that gross feeling afterwards (typical of greasy fast chinese food). I got the cashew chicken the next time and I had 2.5 meals out of it!  The chicken was soft (how?? not sure) and the sauce was not overly sweet and there were plenty of cashews and bright, crispy veggies.  Seriously, we're impressed... hope they keep it up so we can continue getting delivery and to-go.  BTW - I've never eaten-in, so I have no clue about the decor, cleanliness, etc... sorry.

Been here several times and it's actually tough for me to rate this one a 2 because though I did have pretty good memories here, mostly with the Teppanyaki entertainment, I also had one memory that was really not-so-good.. So I'll just stick to a 1.25.  The good memories (let's start off positive): This place is Teppanyaki style, so actually a good spot for a big group that want to eat their hearts out (the portions are super filling, like most Teppanyaki joints).  We've only experience that and not the sushi bar nor the other seating area for non-Teppanyaki.  The staff has been on-par, not amazing, just good and the food is also good and plentiful.  The bad stuff: Their sashimi salad here is BLAH compared to Mikado's (right across the street) and so is their Miso soup and their Tempura veggies.. alll crappy compared to Mikado's. No flavor, no care for quality.. just kind of throw together recipes because it's expected of them. and finally... When we had Teppanyaki with my sister a while back, guess what was slowly crawling the wall behind her... a f*ing roach!   There! And now you know why it's a 1.25!

I *loved* visiting this place.  First off, the owners, there on Sat morning, were very friendly, engaging, and I had a nice time chatting with them about random things.  I asked for an espresso with a light touch of cream and it came out deliciously.  As I sat at the coffee bar with my espresso, I decided, I'd also take one of their cinnamon buns (made locally by Udder Delights.. memo to self!).  The combo of a relaxed, quaint, cozy coffee shop; friendly, engaging staff, and tasty espresso and pastry were enough to leave a mark on me.  Their patio is adorable, too... you don't expect this in Arizona and it certainly doesn't make you feel like you're in Arizona (misters newly added.. cute layout and lots of greenery).  I am a fan and will absolutely return!

I wasn't too impressed with this Farmer's Market - it really doesn't hold a candle to the Gilbert one on Sat nor the Ahwatukee one on Sundays.    Their selection is very, very limited and it's mostly crafters than farmers.  Perhaps the farmers are busy getting ready for Sat and Sun events that it's just not worth attending this day's events.  Oh well - it's a good concept and I think with time and with proper community demand, this one could grow to be bigger and offer a true farm selection because there are plenty of us that support it.

Okay, I have added a star to account for my last 2 visits in which I had better experiences.. funny enough they were better because I got service from the other employees and not the same guy from my previous review (who I now noted works during the day at lunch time - when I will avoid this place).  Recently, I called for a pick-up order after work and had a delicious BYOB Bison waiting for me in the styrofoam container along with a huge load of sweetpot fries (which I must admit are stellar).  The server that picked up the phone was really nice and she had my order exactly as I wanted in a matter of 5-8min of ordering... she was friendly and I appreciated that.  I think if I avoid that server (lunch), I could come here more regularly....  Otherwise you already know I"m a fan of their burgers.. no doubt about that.

Very peeved when I was enjoying some fascinating books on Star Wars ;) at B&N today and then go to order a latte with my SB Au Card and they don't accept them nor SB rewards... whuuhh?  Seriously??  Why even carry the name of the chain if you're not going to treat it like a chain.  Girld told me I could get a B&N card.. eh, me thinks not!  Sorely disappointed... felt tricked.

Been using this lot for several years now for work travel and personal travel.  I *really* like the following: - easy to get in and out, esp if you have your employer's Executive card (you rack up points for stays) - $8.95/day uncovered ($2 extra for covered) - drivers and gate staff have always been friendly, genuine and customer-service oriented - spot is safe and close to the airport for a quick shuttle ride even if you're running late - point redemption is easy if you have an Executive card and an online account - free USA Today and cold water bottle on entry & exit - driver always gives you a reminder card for where you parked your car (life saver!!) and he drops you off exactly at your car, not at some convenient middle spot.  I doubt I'll take my business anywhere else when they've consistently been courteous, quick, friendly, accommodating, and affordable.

I was recently at the Chandler Teavana for a gift idea for my sister.  The gal that helped me was friendly and initially asked me "how much are you looking to spend" - to which I replied "no more than $30" (though I was expecting 35ish with taxes).. she asked other types of questions to get a feel for what she could recommend as a 'gift'.  She did well, except for the MINOR fact that everything she recommended was at least $10 over what I had told her was my budget.  She kept saying "it's a bit more, but I'm sure she'll love it" to every recommendation... and I kept saying "got any thing else in my range?".  I really wasn't necessarily trying to stick to $30.00 max, but once I started to see how she'd only recommend things above $30, I became more of a stickler and was resolute on not giving them any more than $30.00.  When I finally chose the gift and wanted to add a bit of tea, I was hit with the "there's an oz minimum on the tea purchase" and we *highly* recommend (insert strong sales push here) the huge air-tight container... ugh.  This is not the first time, either.  I have been here several times and most of the time it's been off-putting how pushy their employees are.. but I always walked out with something I loved, so I just brushed the annoyance aside.   They have a nice selection of teas.. a bit over-priced, but you're at the mall, so it's expected.  Their tea-accessories are very nice and delicate.. and also pricey.. but if you're a tea snob, you're probably OK with the prices.   I would like to buy accessories without being pushed or hounded.. I'd like to buy tea in *whatever* quantity I wanted and not be hasseled that I should also include the air-tight container and honey wands to better experience the tea.  Short story - great products, pricey, pushy sales staff.  I am resolute on going in and NOT talking to their staff.. even if they make attempts... just say "I'm just browsing".  I wonder how well that would work.

I have been to this place at this location 4 times already and none of them really stood out as being totally bad (obviously since I still returned) nor totally great.  The food is OK and I mostly like the location (close to work and home) and the thought of having breakfast nearby that is not a chain. However, I do want to mention what happened this Sat when I went in for breakfast at 9amish with a group of 3 others.  Our server seemed friendly but our food took a considerable amount of time to get to us (we had 2 kid orders and 2 simple orders of omelet and eggs benny - how can that take so darn long?).  Sure enough when the food got in, it was not even warm, but a few degrees to being room temperature.  My eng muffins were soggy, my avocado was missing, my potatoes (which when served warm are actually one of my favorite things about this place) were room temperature and chewy.  My friends dish was in the same condition.  I asked for it to be warmed (I know, I risked a lot asking this) and it came back maybe a degree warmer, but it was not enjoyable.  My friend liked her omelet and her only complaint was the temperature.  OK, so after this, we all paid the check which involved us putting in a $10 bill and a card.  The card was charged the full balance and the $10 bill was gone.  So essentially she gave herself close to a 35% tip (she didn't even bother to ask, much less give us change).  I asked for change when she came around later and she reluctantly gave it to me.  The nerve!  I can't even understand how she thought we were giving her such a huge tip considering we waited so long for our food and I had to send it back to get it fixed.  Based on this experience I will not be returning... it was OK before, but it just got down-graded to 'i've experienced better'.

Did a cooking class with my 2 gal friends from work and one of their sisters and thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  Website had lots of info on what to expect but I still called and verified a few things and the staff was very friendly and helpful.   The place is smaller than I expected, but it's amazing how much food can come out of such a limited space - we made at least 5 different dishes.. or was it 6?  Not sure, but I tell you that everything tasted excellent (well maybe it needed a little salt :)).  What I enjoyed the most was:  helpful staff, well-planned menu and simplicity of instructions and simplicity of cooking process despite them all being complex dishes.  They helped you if you needed help, gave you extra butter if you needed it and were generally great instructors.  Andy, the owner/chef was engaging, humorous, entertaining and still a great instructor.  Also, plan on about a ~3+hr event... this takes time, my friends, but the meal and the memories will be worth it.  Some cons: small dining area, so plan on sitting REAL close to your friends or strangers; kitchen area is a bit closed in and you share a lot of work and prep area, so if you're a huge lady (like one in this class).. well, you won't fit between all the stations and the stoves;  I would absolutely do this again!

Seriously 5 stars! I called, had a *very reasonable* quote in minutes and I just scheduled him - he had his ish together (you could tell) and sounded more than capable of doing the job I had (fridge pickup and relocation).  John showed up on time and got the job done within the hour (and I lived pretty far and I hadn't emptied my home fridge yet). He was quick to plan, measure and get the job done correctly, quickly and very considerate of my home situation (9pm fridge swap with two babies sleeping nearby and a loud dog). THANK YOU, I highly recommend and I will def call you for any future labor services!!

This is a really nice Macy's to shop at... it somehow feels 'higher' end because it is not organized like the other mall Macy's and because their dressing rooms are spacious, well-lit, and modernly decorated... whereas the mall rooms are like going to try clothes on at Ross!  I found a decent selection of maternity clothes in their itty bitty section of Maternity, so I was satisfied.  The prices were Macy's prices, but they had a coupon you could use for 10% off (unless it was the Motherhood brand... yay for me!.. not!)...  so I didn't get to use it for this purchase.  Besides the very nice decor and layout and modern feel of the Macy's, here were a few things I noted:  The ladies working here were genuinely NICE ladies... very friendly, helpful, talkative, just had a great attitude.  I would come back here over the Chandler Mall just for that :)  PS: they have a Starbucks here but couldn't accept by Gold Card because their system wasn't linked?? :( no Americano for momma.

I enjoyed coming here... very close to the library and I was still able to find a parking spot on the street.  I enjoyed a nice hot latte (yes, I know, in the middle of summer!) and one of their delicious homemade bread mini-loafs... ahhh.. now that I recall, it was sooo good.  The clientele is hip, young, but not too young... lotsa laptops and some business suits... their comfy seats that they had facing the open area were nice and make you want to just sit there all day and do some light people watching.  I would come here again.. more so to relax and enjoy coffee/pastry than to work.. yeah, just to relax.

I visited this office today for the 1st time.  I had previously been a patient at the last location they had near the Scottsdale area.  When I made the call for the appt (at 8am), the kind girl in reception was able to accomodate my request for a same-day appt (at 8:30, no less).  That was pretty awesome that they could accomodate my same-day appt request - big plus.  She was also very friendly and prompt.  I walked in on-time and checked in and sat in the waiting area to read.  It was about 20min later when I got called in by their students (this was a student/Dr rotation).  Good thing I wasn't in a rush to get to work because a lot of things just took longer (some advice for those out there).  The 3 students that took in my vitals and medical history were friendly, warm, and seemed to have good bedside manner.  The lead student had the most questions and I thought was very thorough in her 'investigation' of my concern.  When the Dr. came in, I really enjoyed the visit.  She was also very good at explaining things (educated me) and was warm, genuine, and friendly (and attentive, of course).  I really liked her and would definitely see her again.  Overall, they answered all my questions, took a lot of time asking me medically-relevant questions and digging in to my concern.  They seemed eager to help and eager to get to the root of things (which is RARE in most Dr.'s office's, they just want you in and out!).  Everyone was pleasant and friendly and useful (most important!!).  I'm surprised they have 2 previous bad reviews.  This is the 2nd time I've been to this business for care and I never felt cheated or harassed or strong-armed into anything.  If anything, I always ask costs up front so i don't have sticker-shock later.. maybe that's why I don't have issues...  afterall, they are spending more time on you (that's how they get to the root of problems.. .supposedly).

I've been going to Kokomo for about 3 full punch-cards now.. I'm a light frequentor.    Yes, they have a nice selection of froyo flavors that change from time to time (though not THAT often) and they always seem to offer at least a few dairy free yogurts (not that I personally care, but you'll notice some don't care non-dairy options).  Their selection for toppings is pretty sweet - I really appreciate the variety of fruits and natural options (ie. coconut shreds, almonds, pecans, berries, kiwis, mango, etc).  When I was doing serious calorie couting for a while (yeah, crazy, I know!) I would always ask for their nutrition book (the gal was always very nice and kind to give it to me while I froyo browsed) and would figure out which one was going to cost me the fewest calories for the greatest enjoyment :)  Good thing fruits were basically calorie-free!    No, but seriously, if you're watching your figure, don't be ashamed to ask for the nutrition book.. you'll be delighted to see that a lot of their options are around the 100cal range for 4oz.. and 4oz is actually pretty substantial (another plus is because you pay by the ounce, I would weigh my filled cup before my toppings were applied so I could eyeball 4 oz and THEN I'd load on the fruits!)... nice, eh?  Their staff has always been friendly and never rude or stingey with sample cups.. cuz I always sampled like hell!

This location is super convenient and the parking and strip-mall is always easy to get in and get out.. and if you feel like sitting down, there's sufficient (a bit cozy) room inside or if the weather is nice, there are plenty of tables/chairs outside.    The staff is quick and friendly and since my drink is simple, they've rarely "screwed" it up (unless you count too much foam on a macchiato).  The longest line I've ever had to endure was a whole line of 3 people in front of me (yes, even at peak coffee hour).. so really, no complaints there.  You'll notice a lot of local people do their coffee here as there really is no local coffee joint nearby to give this place any competition (yeah, that's hard to do when it's a SB, but I'd give a local coffee joint my business)... a lot of morning cyclists, or morning ppl enjoying their coffee with a paper.  This is a good Starbucks.. the same faces and consistently well made drinks.. no hassle.. feels local.

Went here last Sunday for breakfast with my family.  Things I liked: -The food we ordered was without a doubt delicious - I do recall saying my pancakes were the best I'd had in forever... loved the maple syrup and warm butter!! My other people's food was inhaled, it was so good (though my SIL thought it was weird, and I agree, that roasted peanuts were on her banana pancakes..... yaaaahh) -The ambiance is nice - family oriented, a bit hip but not too much... casual seating and an open kitchen.. good music, lively ambiance -Their coffee was good.. and I don't usually order a coffee w/ bfast unless I grind it myself and make it myself at home.. it was very flavorful and I had it black.  Things that should be corrected: -Our waitress, though very cute and sweet, was totally brain-dead.  She came by so little and very late and forgot our order or got it wrong (even after explanation of what NOT to put in the order, she got it wrong).  No bueno. -My bro was told the entire menu, save for a few things, were not available until lunch... so he ordered the burger (which wasn't included in what the 'host' gal told him was not available).. after waiting and waiting for waitress to arrive and having your heart set on this burger, you're told, 'sorry, can't for another 25min order that'.... that sucks. -Salsa is extra $... WHUH??? really??? give me a friggin break. -okay.. this one is just to point out, though it's not really their fault: the Schreiner's sausage I ordered was *bland* as heck.. no salt? no real sausage flavor.  I've had Schreiners at BLD, La Bocca, and remember it very well to be so yummy.. this was not enjoyable and I didn't even finish my 1st link, let alone my 2nd.  In short, I would give it another visit since the waitress would likely be different and I know what I liked to eat...

So I've been here a few more times in smaller groups and during less crowded times. My new favorite is the Levain & Lox... it's so very yummy.  I still think it's uber trendy and that's not drawing to me but i honestly enjoy the food and even the staff at the bar (i prefer there lately)is nice and attentive. .it's kind of hipster at times but I've grown to just accept that and still enjoy my food and yummy coffee.

I really have enjoyed this park since it opened up.  I've jogged the pathways numerous times and I like the rugged (yet even), natural, desert feel of the track under my feet.  I've mountain biked the same jogging trail through and through.. even down to the canal.  We've even brought our dog to the doggy park and have had good experiences there.  Overall, this is a great 'desert-park' concept and executed well by COC.  It is well maintained and used by a good amount of people (never "crowded" at all).  A few disappointments: - water fountains have been off the several times I've jogged/biked the park trail (sucks when you forgot or finished your own water bottle) - bathrooms have been locked the same times I found the water fountains off - the doggy park *specifically* says NO KIDS under a certain age, yet STUPID people still bring their tiny children and let them roam around and wrestle with dogs.  That is just a suit waiting to happen - Leave your kid at home or take em to the playground right there, parents!  It's a dog park, not a kid's playground.

When I was researching where to get my Vibrams a while ago, I saw that a local, non-big-box store (unlike REI) carried them in Tempe.  So my sister and I quickly headed here.  We were very impressed with the customer service.  The owner man was very helpful and he had a good selection of Vibrams in the different styles and sizes.  What I appreciated the most was that, since my sister and I were both curious about them and not all to sure we were going to buy them, he let us hang out at his business for at least 2 hours, walking around with the different shoes and seeing how we liked them.  He took our measurements and was really helpful in getting our Vibrams sized correctly.  The fact that we were allowed to wear them (he told us "no obligation") around his business for however long we needed to decide was impressive.. and helped us decide that, YES, we wanted them.  Fast forward a few years later and we still recommend this place - a great local business to support.  I LOVE my Vibrams.. granted I've worn them for several years now for everything including running, weight lifting, hiking, shopping, around the house, etc, that I need a new pair.  You can be sure I'll check Fitness Road again to pick out my next pair.  They introduced me to my first pair and I'd give them my business again.

I really have enjoyed my regular Prenatal Yoga classes here.  I get 3 class options per week and I try to make them all when my Sat doesn't keep me from missing that class option.  I've only taken Prenatal Yoga here so I can't comment on other classes or instructors but the 2 gals that teach these classes (Sally and Nikki) are great - they both have different styles of teaching but both have a lot of experience with birthing, home births, natural birth, yoga, etc - I appreciate both instructors for the differences they have and offer.    My ONLY complaint for this Tempe location (has nothing to do with the instructors) is that they can oftentimes PACK pregger ladies in to the smallest yoga room (It is very frustrating to be so cramped in there) and then even when it's full, they STILL try to fit one more girl in there.  It has nothing to do with people coming late, it has to do with the class room being too small for the amount of women that are attending.  The past few times, we had 14 or was it 15? girls in there - WAY too many.  At that point, you can't even stagger mats or do poses correctly.  I really wish they would plan this out better.  Other than that little issue - I LOVE the class, the instructors, and I enjoy getting to know the other pregnant ladies and sharing this great life event... the staff is always friendly and nice and I like that they are very earthy in the facility... like walking the walk, not just talking the talk.  Anyway, if you're pregnant - you NEED to take these classes... we'll see how my delivery goes, but I'm confident I have learned some valuable tools and stretches/positions for what I want to experience during my natural birth.

On our drive to Tucson (yes, we took the long way.. more scenic) we stopped by.. it was the only place en-route that seemed to have consistently decent reviews.  The place is easily found, clean and is well staffed with nice folks. I had the cashew chicken and was a bit put off when it showed up with corn in it.. it seemed like an obvious "filler"... oh well, I guess. The flavor was meh... i think it was missing garlic, ginger.. tastes that engage your senses.. this did not engage anything. At least we gave it a shot!

I have had a couple of different types of services at this location.  I saw two different gals for hair cuts and styling and then saw one lady for nails.  My overall rating is 4 stars because the facility is in excellent condition, the decor is modern, tasteful, welcoming and all the gals I saw for hair or nails did a great job.    I went today and got my bangs touched up and my hair done and this time specifically requested a stylist.  She was awesome and you can tell that she is highly experienced and trained as a hair stylist.  She explained to me a lot of things regarding proper cuts and proper way of layering for my hair type and hair density - who knew?!  She did an excellent job and then to top it off, she gave me a 20% discount (I'm not sure why, really!), but you can bet your butt I will be seeing her again.  As far as the other hair gals I'd seen previously, sadly, they didn't stick out in my mind, but they did a fairly good job.... The only reason the nail lady (Aurora) was memorable was because, though was very accommodating when I had a wedding to go to, I didn't care for the fact that when I accidentally bumped my finger and smudged the polish, she about had a mini fit!  Then when she went to touch my toenails to see if they were dry, she smudged them and said "oops.. well, it's not too bad" and left them like that.  Bummer I won't be going to her again, but I really like the salon and I am looking forward to see my new sylist again in a few months!

As soon as this place opened up a while back, I was excited to go.  I did a walk-in and with very few words, was quickly taken to a back room that is decorated in dark/warm colors with 3 comfy couches (recliners) that each have an ottoman.  As soon as I laid in the couth to relax, the lady was quick to get her supplies and immediately started.  I felt very at ease with her and she did very little talking (if anything, actually) except to ask simple questions.. not sure she knew much english besides the questions she asked.  Like everyone else says - you can't beat 1 hour massage service that extends beyond your feet and includes your legs, back and arms for $30 (fully clothed) ... oh yeah, and the little lady had AMAZING fingers and strength and just worked her butt off to make my massage thorough, relaxing, and above all, pampering.  Here's where it got kinda odd.. I went again later and, again, with very few words, was whisked away to a back room.  Now, I'm not sure how other people found this place busy, but both times it has been dead empty (hence the quick seating).. a bit awkward feeling with it being that empty and quiet nd all, but maybe I go at strange times of the day/week.. dunno.    Okay, so back to my weird experience.  This time instead of a nice older lady, I got a middle-aged, VERY rotund man...also a profuse sweater .. I was pretty distracted by his heavy breathing and profuse sweating.. ewww.. I don't want to think about it anymore.  So, he was very thorough and had good force in his massge.. but I couldn't help but feel TOTALLY weird and strange when he was heavy breathing and sweating everywhere as he worked all over me... PLUS he didn't speak a lick of english (like the previous lady I had), so anything I would ask him, like "can you concentrate on my right toe - it's a bit strained" could not be understood.. at all (I had to resort to hand-signals, etc).   I wish I could've had the option of chosing a 'therapist', but this place doesn't really work that way.. you'll see when you get there.  So, in short: great massage service (they definitely put their back in to it), great pricing, relaxing (if you don't get Mr. heavy breather who sweats everywhere).  Next time I go back I'm going to request a female... if that's allowed.

Been coming to PetClub for a long time now, since we had to ween our dog off of this gross Puppy Beneful his famly had him on.  He easily transitioned to Solid Gold, which, along with many of the other products PetClub carries, is a more appropriate dry food that is not natural, holistic and free of preservatives and chemicals (well at least that's what the bags claim).  I like this place because it has a ton of stuff in such a small building - food for cats/dogs; toys; treats; pet supplies - you don't have to wander around a PetSmart or a PetCo when you have this place packed with things;  They are usually run by friendly high-school aged kids that amazingly know (or have been well-trained on) a lot about pet nutrition and the brands they carry.  Another thing I like is they have new treats I like to try out on our dog: raw bones, raw animal meat, deer antlers (as chewing/gnawing treats); pet ice-cream.. basically a lot of alternative food and treats for your pet.    Prices are good, too - we compared what we pay for our big bag of food to PetCo (Petsmart doesn't even carry Solid Gold) and we are paying less by buying it here and supporting a local business.

Their green curry (my fave!) here is very good and I like their lunch portions - they are very filling and also include a hot soup and rice at a great price.  When I was last there, I had asked about 'added sugars' in the sauce (a lot of asian restaurants add a lot of sugar to dishes to enhance the 'addiction' quality of it) - he (I think it was the owner) kindly explained that he could absolutely make mine however I liked it - that is customer service!  So, he made my dish with no sugar and, though it wasn't as addicting as it typically would be, I appreciated that I could ask for that modification.  That being said, their service here is on-par and so is their food... I prefer this place over Thai Rama (also nearby).  They are quick, offer filling lunch specials, and good business owners.

I have been a customer of theirs for a couple of years now.  They are by no means a cheap product - in fact, they have such a superior taste and quality to them that, since buying wild, freshly caught, frozen Salmon, Sablefish, Halibut, and Prawns from this group, I can't imagine eating farmed fish, much less giving my money to a grocery store for their so-called 'fresh and wild-caught' fish.  The middle man is cut out with them and so you get your product fresh and direct while working directly with the fishers.  Both guys that run this stand at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market are fishers and can educate you a great deal on their products and fishing practices.  My frequent travels to AK have also given me a better understanding of the cost and logistics required to support wild-caught fish product shipment to the lower 48, so the cost is highly justified.  I challenge you to prepare one of their Sablefish portions (my current favorite for it's super-duper-Omega-fatty content) to the required minimum of 140deg with but the simplest seasonings (salt and pepper, squeeze of lemon) and not fall in love with it.  You will die in mouth-watering goodness... buttery, soft, flavorful, so good for you!  It's the best!!  Also, check out their site for prices so you don't get sticker shock :)

I've been coming to LaVida for a long time now.  I have had to try a few therapists before I settled on one (then she got waaaay to social and talkative so I wasn't finding it relaxing and so I had to find another one there I liked better) but now I really enjoy and look forward to my therapist... reasons why I LOVE her as my therapist: she is well-versed in her job - how the body works and the mind-body connection; she's very experienced; she is has a calm, gentle, pleasant nature about her; she has a gift for her job; she is a yoga instructor, so she has lots of tips; her work is consistently thorough, forceful when needed and gentle when needed... another important fact (to me, at least), she knows when to talk and when not to talk.  I love that about her!  If a therapist is AWESOME and she won't shut the hey up about gossip - how the heck are you supposed to relax?  I'm sure you'll find you want another therapist because the whole point is to relax, not catch up on gossip.. that's what your coworkers are for!  The ambiance at the location is very nice except for this nauseatingly stinky potpourri they have in a hot pot that is new and is sooo gross.. besides that tiny little detail, I really like the place - elegant, relaxing, comfortable rooms with appropriate lighting and awesome beds with heated blankets if you chose so.  The staff up front have always been great and welcoming.  They have a monthly plan.. $49 auto deducted monthly for 1 session and you can share them w/ another person or if you can't make it, they roll over.  Also, it's easy to cancel and add'l services are greatly discounted (ie. more massages, facials, etc).  I'm a fan!

My BFF planned an awesome dinner here to start off the evening that was my Bachelorette Party.  Our party of 10 or so were seated smack in the middle (near the bull) at this huge round table and we had the most attentive waiting staff ever (our server gal was accommodating with the size, our orders and the bill... AND she even  bought our table a few rounds of shots! .... Kickass!!).    The manager was attentive, too... after convincing my drunken butt to get on the bull, he presented me with a gift bag with a hot pair of knickers inside that had their logo and some skanky phrase printed on it... I've never worn them, but, hell, I thought that was pretty great for making my evening feel special!  I'd also like to point out that on this particular night, there was a HUGE hockey game (Wings were playing) next door... so even with a busy restaurant, their staff did a great job of providing awesome and memorable service.  I don't recall what I ate (probably because I didn't eat so much as I socialized), but I do recall one of my gal friends (vegetarian) ordered their Sweet Potato fries and it came with this amazing marshmallow dip ... it was so yummy.. finger lickin' good.  I think this is a great place for anyone wanting to start off the night in a fun atmosphere with great staff..  I can't vouch for any of the food, 'cept the sweetpots but I was delighted it turned out to be such a perfect start to the night.

SIL and I went here and had an outstanding burger experience!  I just wish there was one closer to my side of town :(  Alas, when we want a guaranteed good burger experience (a la 'non-fast-food' style), we know here's where it's at.  Plus, who doesn't enjoy having a glass of zin with their burger.. mine certainly paired perfectly.  I had the Zinburger and was *loving* the cheese (I like funky cheeses on my beef), but what stood out the most was the perfectly cooked and moist (and a little pink) patty.  These people know when to stop cooking the patty (unlike some other places I've recently reviewed.. ugh).  My SIL had the same but I had added a few toppings (hence mine was a little more pricey but had much more interesting flavors with every bite).  We decided to split the sweetpot fries.. .oof, so good!  I don't think I'm a fan of their dipping sauce, but I don't need no stinkin' dipping sauce for my fries.. they were well cooked and very plentiful.. enough to share!  We sat outside in the patio area and, though it was busy busy busy (as always), we had good service and the atmosphere was really relaxing and up-beat at the same time.

This review is from a spectator and not a participant.   My friends from work have been telling me about this place for some time now (since they do it regularly) and so on this very evening, we were invited to watch their Sat 8pm performance.  We showed up and it was pretty darn packed.. lots of turnout.. lots of people coming to watch their family and friends perform - I thought that was neat.  Plus, they had the cotton-candy machine running (I think $3 ea) and popcorn, so it really helped set the atmopshere.    We sat on bleachers and were entertained for a good hour and a half by the FOF (1st year, I think) and by the advanced students.  I was impressed with their work (hell, you won't find me trapezing in this life time!) and most impressed with the 'catchers' and how fit and punctual they have to be to do their job.  The two owners, as I understand it, were doing the 'catching', so obviously they are highly experienced to do the job.  Good time, entertaining evening.. and after the show, they had $10 fly-bys for anyone which I guess means you go up the stairs, get harnessed, and get to fly on the bar/swing and then flip and drop on to the trampoline/net they have below... they had a lot of people doing this after the show.  Very cool!

We had a pretty darn good time.  Decided to take my two nieces to the festival.  Our total cost for 3 of us w/ 2 bracelets before food and extras was $64 - and the girls got on almost every ride, even the big, scary ones!  We went on a Friday at 4ish and the crowd was perfect and relaxed.. absolutely no lines.  Come 6pm, though, that all changed.  The lines got big and it started to not matter to get our bracelets worth of rides for the wait in line (plus the cold night air!).  Also, come 6pm, it just got plain ridiculous with all these little high school kids wearing skimpy clothes and making out and talking bad (where are these kid's parents!?!.. who raised these kids!?!).. it got annoying real quick.  The shows: - Ostrich Race at 6pm was good - kinda funny, but not that entertaining - Monkey Show at 9pm was AWESOME - I saw this show last year when we went with the in-laws and I *still* laughed my butt off (easily amused maybe?) - Petting Zoo - LOVE this.. they had a lot of baby goats (my fave!) and the animals were never menacing and actually very docile. - In the past I saw the trapeze show and it was entertaining, though the motorcycles in the metal sphere was quite impressive and very entertaining  Overall, the price was decent for the entertainment and the rides the gals got to enjoy; the food was typical fair food (FYI, DO shop around.. prices change across similar products by 2-3$ sometimes, so feel free to shop around for water bottles and other food staples); the staff running the rides were decent people (not creepy, which can be the status quo); the ambiance is good (not OVERLY ghetto) but caution that after 7pm, it gets more crowded with high school kids.. so more lines and more stupid conversations you get to listen to.. yay!

If your'e looking to get your noodle fix, this is the place.  Tucked in a strip-mall with a funny (yet somehow appropriate) name, this little humble place offers 'hand-pulled' noodles made all day (you can see through the window in to the kitchen where they are pulling the noodles.  Been here several times already and I must say, they are a) very friendly b) very quick  c) affordable for going a few times a week and... most importantly d) have tasty food. The atmosphere is mostly of asian families and couples, also enjoying their meal here.  I was impressed with our party of, yes, FIFTEEN co-workes (my idea!) who sloppily put together 2 round tables and 1 square so we could all fit and who were promptly served... it wasn't even a few minutes after I had said my order that I got my dish... the only bummer was that we all got our dishes super quick except for our boss (who actually paid for all of us! poor guy!).  They were apologetic and he's a nice guy, so it worked out.  Their tapioca milk is yummy and perfectly sweetened, too.  Like I said, this is a great spot if you're looking to fill your noodle cravings... I absolutely will be coming back.  PS: I would not recommend take-out of the noodle soups... did this and, though it was filing and such, it wasn't as flavorful that the noodles hadn't melded w/ the broth long enough.

Stay away from Chompie's if you're at all trying to 'watch what you eat'.. from the time you walk in and are greeted by the vast display of goodies and pastries.. to the extensive menu that offers everything from all-day breakfast dishes like challah roll french toast to mile high sandwiches, you will likely be un-successful in ordering, much less consuming something that is figure friendly.    Well I have been eating waaay too many salads this month, so I was really hard up for some meat and some tasty animal fat... wasn't wanting to go all out, but I definitely wanted a non-salad meal, heavy with protein & animal fat.  I didn't exactly pick this place (it was more of a group decision), but it would have to do.    Our party of 4 got seated quickly during prime Fri lunch time and commenced to read the literary novel that is their 15 page menu (ok, maybe more like 8)...  'I want some meat, a big ass hunk of meat... ooh, there's a mile-high pastrami... nah.. OOoh, how bout sliders?.. nah, too much bread..  fish?...ooh, they have all-you-can-eat fish & chips today???... FOCUS April! you're looking for MEAT... alright... maybe a burger?.. yeah.. gluten free bread?.. hmm.. not bad.. why not?.. oh yeah, AND with BACON on it.. and some cheese!'  There! I had gone through all my meat-options on the menu and settled on a huge bacon cheese-burger with a Gluten-Free bun and side of sweet potatoes.    When the order came up, it was ginormous!  Actually, ALL our orders were huge plates, plentiful with fries and those who got mile-highs were also stacked high with sandwich meat.  We all walked out stuffed and some with to-go boxes.  I tried the fish & chips and it was decent (not better than the fish I've had at FIbbers, but decent).  I wasn't underwhelmed with my Gluten-free bun.  It was tall and had a small diameter (like a muffin), so it was very awkward to eat it as the 'bun' when the huge diamater meat patty hung over... so I just removed it and had the patty, bacon, and cheese solo.. and of course some fries.  BTW, their fries were, across the plates at our table, soggy and not crisp (my table partners didn't like that, but I love soggy fries, so I can't complain.. apparently, soggy is not the popular vote for fries).  All in all: quick seating at lunch time, friendly waitress did her job, manager came by to great us, food was huge portions, soggy fries, odd GF bun, great selection of deserts, overwhelming lunch menu... immediate lunch food coma.

So I'm going to break it down factually because I feel a bit bad for ranking it so low though I believe I have plenty of reasons for the 2 star review:  1- Service - I appreciated the service we got upon arrival;  Our server gal was friendly and did a great job of getting our large party set up as comfortably as possible;  She took our orders in a prompt fashion but the food did take a considerably long time to get there and all of us had to feast on 2 rounds of chips and salsa in the meantime; We were a huge party, so I can forgive some of that wait; For drink refills, there they seriously lacked - the sodas never got refilled until the very end when I ended up walking up to the bar to ask for refills.  Overall, they were very friendly and accommodating with the seating, and slow with a few things.  2- Cleanliness - Everything looked clean and well take care of, even decor was pleasant and things looked tended to. I did note that because the front doors were wide open (to make it look less dark and intimate), there were a considerable amount of flies hovering and buzzing about... no bueno to eat food and constantly slap away flies.  3- Food quality - Here is where they lost almost all their stars.  The food was, frankly some of the most boring and bland food I've had in a long time and definitely not representative of any Mexican flavors.. New or not:  The street tacos had plain dry meat and simple toppings and were blah; the Tortilla Soup was a muddy/murky mixture of one single flavor and more of a sludge than a soup; the Adovada was not flavorful at all and bland, despite being so colorful; the beans were not cooked long enough and dry and the rice was too firm to be called 'Spanish rice'; I noted no complaints from the Quesadilla people... but then again, can you really screw up a quesadilla??  Anyway, this area is where they seriously lacked: flavor and well-executed recipes.  4- Pricing - Pricing was decent I guess for an Ahwatukee sit-down restaurant; Honestly, if they served this in any other part of town where more Latinos frequented, you couldn't charge that much for flavorless food (note all the non-Latino 4 & 5 star reviews).  5 - I am saving this star for the experience - Not a memorable experience, ok atmosphere (minus the flies), friendly though slow service but a very un-memorable culinary experience with poorly flavored food... a solid 2 star experience for me.  I don't think I'll make any effort to come here again as I'm not missing anything.

Bummer to read such negative reviews about a business I've never been disappointed by.  First off, Hobby Lobby has just about *everything* you could possibly buy at Michaels, Pier One, and Party City all in one big store.  Second part - their prices are great!  I have bought lots of whos-its and whats-its for home decoration, crafts, gifts, etc that are very well priced and that I know I'd find more expensive at any of the above-mentioned stores.    After those 2 main points of huge selection and great prices you have customer service.  I have never had a problem here with bad service, in fact I find the staff really friendly and willing to help navigate the store.  The lines may have been long a few times before, but not so bad that I'd say "eff it, I'm not coming back".. nor that I'd be furious about.  Honestly, the only big negative I could find was that I want to buy too many things when I come here because they have so many cool things for the house and for crafts.. but is that really a negative??  I'm a fan of this place and I'm not even a house-wife!!

I'm still not sure if it's a 3 or a 4.. so let me give you the experience. This place is very small - they have an outside patio that seats about 11 total.. and 5 more on couches with these almost hideous looking coffee-tables.  We arrived on a Friday (First Friday, which we totally hadn't planned that) and since we didn't know we'd need (nor had we made) reservations, we were seated on a two-person red couch with the ugly coffee-table to eat from.  We were both not big fans of this, but hey, at least we got seated with no reservations (there were a lot of ppl that came after us with no reservations and were turned away.. sucks).  Ordered two beers - they came out quickly.  Ordered 2 entrees: the Market special (which was veal) and the Portuguese Stew.  I had the stew and he had the veal.  His came out quite a bit before mine (didn't care for that) and then when I finally got mine, it was not at all what I expected.  It was *spicy* as all hell (I must've missed that on the menu) and had a lot of seafood and a big tilapia on top... I guess I was expecting a soup.. that's my bad for not knowing that stews and soups are different.  He loved his dish (finished it before me) and I did not care for mine with all the spiciness (I had a runny nose the whole time from the spice).. luckily the server lady asked how I was liking it and I told her the truth but told her I was really hungry so I was just going to eat it. She said sorry, left and came back and said the chef wanted to add extra sauce to tame down the spiciness.. she brought it back quickly and it was heaping with mixed in manchego cheese (though the tilapia I hadn't finished yet was missing now).. the flavor was fabulous.. but it left me wondering about my tilapia.  Maybe he switched the tilapia out for more mussels.. whatever, that's fine.  I was just glad that I could finally eat my meal.. though I ate it alone because, again, his meal had come first and was now gone (I told him not to wait because I knew a freshly hot veal chop would get cold in the patio where we were and would not be as enjoyable).  SO.. alas.. conclusions: there were several minuses mixed in with some pluses.. I wouldn't say I'd never go back, but it was a good experience and I'd give it another try to see how it would go on another visit.

first off... how the HECK does this place get even close to 4 stars? Something is seriously wrong with the rating system... you won't dupe me again!   My husband and I had dinner recently from here.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the decor is very nice, warm, and also welcoming.    I was really looking forward to my linguini pesto with shrimp.  Hubby got veal marsala.  Sadly, we did not have a good impression... our food was very blah... highly blah.  All 6 of the shrimp in my dish were overcooked, chewy, and flavorless.. the "pesto" was invisible, as I saw only glimpses of green in my linguini.. this was not pesto sauce, it was sprinkles of herbs.  Hubby's veal marsala portion was quite small and uninspired flavor... his mashed taters seemed like they could be good but were missing something.  I really wanted to like this place because there are so few non-chain restaurants here in S Chandler and you get so sick of seeing all these Texas Roadhouse/ Fatburger/ Red Lobster chains taking over our neighborhoods, but this place needs to seriously up their game.  Everything I tasted from our order was not flavorful... not inspired... needed more ingredients... and needed salt, except for the zucchini with caramelized onions, which were actually very pleasant  Short story, for the almost $40 I paid to eat here, I will not be making that mistake again... the portions and amount of ingredients does not warrant such an expensive meal for two when it's this disappointing.    oh yeah and, no, we are not from Sun Lakes.... if you couldn't tell... :-P

I really love this little business.  They are true to what real Mexican Paletas are supposed to be - fresh fruit ingredients, no preservatives, all natural with no fake flavors or fake colors to account for cheap ingredients.  I wish the owners the best with this business because I think they are approaching Paletas the way I would - upscale target audience (ie. they are not .99c paletas like at the grocery store) that appreciate the work and ingenuity they bring to the flavors and combinations of their paletas  This evening, we tried the Cereze (cherries *baptized* and wading in brandy, then mixed with home-made roasted almond milk) and the Zarzamora (blackberries with a hint of lavender) - my sister and I were both on cloud 9 with the flavorings (she liked my Cereza waaay more.... I found hers was equally awesome).  Their price point is 3ish, depending on what the ingredients are.  I will keep being a fan and loyal here, as long as they keep to their clean, natural, creative ingredients.

My brother is a huge fan of this place, so he's the one that introduced us here.  So far, we've been to this restaurant 2 times.. both for celebratory events (birthdays).  There are a ton of reviews, so I'm going to make it short and sweet: - food not on the HH menu is expensive and, for what I've tasted (which was actually quite a lot of dishes), there were only a few that deserved that pricing (one I recall was the lamb chops)... and if I don't remember the food I had, it's cuz I didn't find it that memorable. - it is super trendy and thus crowded and you *need* a reservation  This is NOT how I enjoyed having tapas in Spain... things were casual, affordable, simple but tasty, not pompous nor snobbish.  That is the kind of tapas place I would like to go to (and was expecting my first time here).  Short story: not really my kind of place... food wasn't memorable enough (nor was the ambiance enjoyable enough) for my taste.. wasn't worth the money we blew eating here... sorry, bro....

My disclaimer - I went on a Wednesday night for the Karaoke competition (it was the finale); I had no food, but I did have beverage service, so I can't rate their food.  Our server was great!  He was quick, nice, comical, etc.  The ambiance was OK, too - lots of people and lots of energy.  Now to the bad points, which really only reflect on the proprieter.  The Karaoke DJ gal (Emma) was super loud and completely obonoxious (and gross - vulgar, I mean, in a-"hello? I'm eating here, can you not say those things!"-kind-of-way...eventhough I was not eating.. but everyone around me was).  I am not exagerrating, but my ears were ringing at the end of the night - I should have brought my earplugs (Jenni L!, I totally hear you on that you should carry earplugs in your purse).. I felt like I was competing with Emma or the loud microphone the whole time to talk to my hubby sitting right next to me.  I also thought it was completely rigged that the owner's daughter won the Karaoke competition (and thus a few hundred bucks.. WTcrap is that about??).  Because of those things, I probably would not go back on a Wed... and probably not any other time - besides the server, nothing seemed memorable.

I was really impressed walking in here and then walking out with a delicious almond-milk latte (I've only seen soymilk as a milk alternative in lots of other coffee places, so that was a huge plus!).  First off, it was a Fri 8ish morning, so NO LINE (yay!) and the gal that attended me was very friendly and cheerful/upbeat.  You could tell she like her job and that made for a plus experience.  I watched her grind my beans, tamp them, and the rest of the ordeal and was quite impressed with the flavor of steamed almond milk with a latte (my first!).  It was flavorful and nutty and had a very perculiar taste that I immediately fell in love with.  I will have to get another almond-milk latte here.. which won't be hard because they are really close by.. oh, and cheap!    Flavorful $3.50 16oz almond-milk latte + nice inviting atmosphere + friendly staff = 5 stars!  Seriously the ONLY downside was I really wish they had pastries that were 'cafe'-like.. ie. homemade muffins or cookies.  Costco muffins are awesome, don't get me wrong, but I think it would be cool if they had local or home-made goodies :)  it would nicely round out the place!  Still.. I'm a fan and will be back! Nextime I'll bring my nook and read.

I've been to this location several times now and none of my experiences stand out, in fact they've all been between the ranges of 'crappy' and 'lame'.  It's close enough so friends often mention it for Happy Hour consideration... but, as of late, with so many BETTER options nearby, I try to steer the HH selection away from this place.  The service is OK if you sit indoors, but when we've sat outdoors during lunch or after work, it has been slow at best and sub par.  That isn't the biggest complaint.  I think their food seriously sucks, even for 'bar & grill' standards... sliders were plain, breaded shrimp MEH, chicken strips YUK, tacos YUKKIER, beans BARF!  You get the idea.  I even had their mixed drinks and found them highly disappointing and lackluster.. but, hey, if you want to toss some peanuts on the floor and drink a beer or 4, this might work for you!  I like to eat tasty food (yes, even when I'm drinking) so I vote to skip this joint, even if it is just for a few beers.  Patio is nice and can be enjoyable if you're buzzed enough to not care about getting tasty food and can ignore slow, lackluster service.. oh yeah, and if it's not 100deg out.

it feels odd to write a review about a convenience store... BUT, this place stood out in my mind. Unlike EVERY OTHER Circle K I've been to, they are actually clean inside and have respectable looking employees that are nice and friendly to you.  Honestly, I only have come to expect that from QT employees... so, kudos to this location for being clean, feeling safe, always open, and still hiring good, decent people to operate it.

Loved our first visit here!  Good thing we mapped the spot because it would definitely be easy to miss given it's on Oregon in a residential neighborhood just W of AZ Ave.  We were quickly seated in their outdoor patio.  The weather was fair and breezy, so it was a good option to be outside.  Patio furniture is plain and decor is sparse, but the friendliness of the staff and the anticipation of some yummy food kept us happy.  Our order did take a bit long to fill (the friendly server gave us a heads up on that before we waited too long or got frustrated), but when it came, I thoroughly enjoyed my green eggs and ham, Sam I am!  My hubby got the Morning Monte and enjoyed it but not as much as he liked the bite from my green eggs and ham (he said mine was definitely much tastier).  The meals were very filling and at 18$ for breakfast for two - I like that!!  I will definitely come again as their other omelets and burritos looked worth trying.

Been to this Farmers Market now a few times and I seem to like it better than the one in the 'Tuke - it seems more open and I don't hear pushy vendors trying to sell me stuff when I'm walking by, obviously in a hurry (I like to take a list and get in and get out sometimes).  But, I totally understand that they are small businesses just trying to grow.. so I do stop by and support..  I really like the Double Check Ranch products - great grass-fed beef and their whole chicken is great tasting.  I also like Desert Roots (now my CSA) for their produce.   I like the location of this market and they have a nice variety of things to buy.

I had the *hardest* time finding this place.. circled around Warner and Alma School because the Yelp map was a bit confusing.  Once I found it, I really enjoyed it.  Granted, it was the afternoon on a week day, but the owners nevertheless were friendly and very talkative and the place, though a bit empty and maybe a little too bright, was welcoming and relaxing.  I liked all the couches they had... very inviting to relax.  They had a few baked goodies (biscotti - the cranberry and orange flavor were different from the usual chocolate/vanilla ones and it was very tasty) and some of these yummy Bobo's Oat Bars (the coconut is my favorite, but they had just ordered it and it wasn't in yet)... but, most importantly, they had a delicious latte.. freshly ground and pulled correctly so it was very enjoyable.  I def will come back one of these evenings.. a great place to read, study, work on your laptop, etc.

Visited this Farm as part of the Arcadia Edible Garden Tour and I really enjoyed myself here.  As it was the first stop on the tour, I took advantage of the yummy treats they were selling.  They had lots of herbs and some peaches; breads (amazing little ciabatta breads) and then this to-die-for caramel made from.. you'd never guess.. goat's milk!  It was fantastic over the Crow's Dairy goat-milk gelato they also sold there (BTW, Crow's Dairy is Buckeye, AZ's goat farm and sells at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market every Sunday).  Okay, back to the farm - It has a very not-so-organized (almost wild-looking) layout and growth about it.. everything seems like seeds were just sprinkled and watered, and, POOF, garden!  You can walk the gardens, but don't touch (duh!) and then you can go see the chickens in the back and then see the goats to the side.  It's very family friendly as they have little paths and signs that tell you where you can go and where you should stay out.  Their little snack-shack area, as I mentioned, had all sorts of goodies... they even had this outstanding blueberry muffin the gal had just made - yum!  The goat milk gelato was so tasty and their caramel is something you must get and take home.  If I lived in this area, I'd definitely come here for the eggs... sadly, I don't, but you should if you live nearby.

Went here for a work lunch (group of 9) and the hostess and the waitresses were very accomodating (given our size and needing to move tables once due to our growing group).  They got all our orders correct and I was happy that they were able to get my order correct as I was that 'pain-in-the-bum' customer that had the requests for 'no' this and 'no' that.  The Manager even came out to make sure that my order (with all the picky stuff) was correct - I was impressed with that, so kudos to the guy who manages that place!  The ambiance is nice and you can't go wrong with their food for lunch (minus the food coma you get afterwards).  I want to go back after I'm done with this allergy detox diet I'm doing and enjoy a nice big meatball sandwich!

a few months later and I have to update my review.  Remember how I was saying even though it didn't capture me those first several visits?  Well, I kept going anyway... not out of my way, just casually when there were no other options I was interested in, I'd say "how 'bout BLD?".    So, 4 visits later, I feel I owe them another star.. they seemed to have picked up their game.  The dish I thought was not executed well (green chile pork tostada) was very well put together and so flavorful that I had to Yelp about it.  The other menu items I ventured to try were the scrambles.. specifically the shrimp-chorizo - AH! DELICIOSO!!  quickly became one of my favorite dishes!  See? I knew there was something special about this place.. they just needed to work out all the kinks.. and it seems like they did, I've noticed.  Also, the waiters have been good - prompt, accomodating, and informative.. that helps a lot.  So, thank you, thank you for making improvements.. you now can count me as a fan!

The WORST service ever!  We showed up early on Thur night for dinner with some family and when we entered in, we literally waited over 10min to be acknowledged.  Add to that that when we did get acknowledged, it was by some guy that hurriedly told us that they were closing early (it was before 8 and they close at 9) that day and couldn't serve us.  *Are you kidding me??*  We were all really hungry and would hav never expected to be turned away that early for closing plans.  The door outside said 9, therefore you should stop allowing customers at 9, not an hour before - Truly disappointed and peeved.  Never going back!!

This was our first time here and we came at the recommendation of Jenni L.  We really enjoyed our meal here this evening.  Our party was 6 and we easily found seating and were quickly served.  The ambiance is nice - dark place, modern decor and styling.  The menu is very simple but offers quite an eclectic 'asian' selection of food.  I chose the curry noodles with chicken and was impressed with the flavor as well as the juicy texture of the white chicken meat (hell, I can't even get my chicken breast that juicy at home!).  Noodles were cooked well.. not soggy and not too hard - but perfectly cooked with a bit of a bite to them.  Our server was prompt and friendly and we enjoyed our evening here.  The food was highly filling (their bowls are friggin huge!) and I seriously didn't expect to be able to eat all that they served me (but I did!).  I would come back again if I were in the neighborhood.

I'm a fan of this place for some key reasons: 1- Ingredients look and taste fresh; they are not stingey with the good veggies either (like red bell peppers, red onions, olive oil, etc); Oh yeah and their portions are impressive (salads are HUGE, lavash wraps are HUGE). 2- The kitchen staff (which is visible from the seating area) is impressively quick (and accurate) - On more than several occasions, I have walked in and made a to-go order that is fulfilled in less than 7 minutes. 3- Prices are very good; Great for those that go out to eat on a daily/weekly basis (not me, I'm more of a 'cook at home' kinda gal).  Tip: Order the Lavash wrap (pick whatever you want inside: chicken, gyro, etc), but get the whole wheat lavash... NO one offers whole wheat lavash, but THEY do :)  Their Spartan Fries are yummy!  Stay away from the calamari appetizer.. I've had amazing fried calamari in the coast of CA and in Spain and this dish was shameful, sorry!! but true!!

I like coming here on occasion.. as a new mom, I like the baby/mom-centric gear galore... she stocks so many things here, it's quite impressive.  From Belly Bandits to Medela pump supplies.... from nail polish to adorable onesies.. everything for baby and mamma. Things aren't cheap (yes, you can find Motherlove cheaper at Sprouts) but her service and advice are super valuable... she is a mom, so she knows what moms are looking for.  It's also a great place to buy very boutique-y things like cute toys.. baby outfits.. baby accessories... great gift-buying selection. I am personally thankful for her awesome support of breastfeeding moms: hospital grade pumps, pumping/nursing bras, medela/ameda pump supplies, SNS.... she has it all there! and she will help you with things.

So this is the 2nd MMA-centric gym I've been a member of (the previous one was AZ Combat Sports) and this place a notch higher than ACS.   They have a lot of classes available for sparring, personal training, and youth jiu jitsu - I have not taken any of those so can't rate it in regards to those classes.  I went for one-on-one training and I usually went on the weekdays and a few times on the weekends for training there and I always noted a few things: Their treadmills are GROSS - to where you do NOT want to touch them with your finger (mabye the back of your hand); the staff is nice and welcoming; the bathroom is clean and tidy; the sparring area is stinky and all the ppl around there seem to treat the area like their own dirty hamper (seriously? used bandages on the floor? dirty socks on the floor? disgusting!).  My trainer even was appalled at the 'cleanliness' situation there.   After several months here, I decided not to renew because it was so off-putting.  On a positive note, I frequently got to see Ryan Bader train and hang out there (one of the owners and a prof MMA fighter) - that was cool.. and he's a nice guy and is friendly and such. Back to the facility: they need a cleaning crew because the sparring area *stinks*, the machines are grimy and dusty and full of gross debris and it was nasty that I had to put a papertowel down for my arms when I did planks just so that I would't get ppls nasty body hair or other debris on my skin!! PS: sometimes they play some music on the speakers that is JUST not appropriate for kids... but they have a lot of kid's jiu jitsu classes, so I don't understand that rationale.

Small, local owned/operated Filipino bake shop.  I only tried the 5 pack of Ube (Taro) stuffed cookies/pastries and found them DELICIOUS.. the have sesame seed sprinkled on them.  I wish I knew what most of it meant, but I tried my luck with the sweet ube pastry and really, really liked it!  I will be back and try more!  Thanks to all those (Jason B) that recommended pastries.. I definitely will try more out next time.

Oh man!  Rarely do I hand out 5 stars... but this place is an exception.  First off, don't be turned off by the crummy strip mall it's in, or the Tempe trash that loiters around outside scratching at their coke bugs... or the fact that u-turns and left-hand turns are a pain in the ass off of Apache due to this light-rail set-up - you must open your mind!  The guy working tonight was either the owner or son of the owner or something but he KNEW customer service.  He was welcoming, friendly, informative... diligent with cleaning up, taking and bringing orders AND answering the myriad of questions I threw out at him (like "is the lamb leg or shoulder... are the bones included...?")  This guy knew his food (we shared our goat meat sources and cooking tips) and described everything in a very detailed way.  I sure wasn't asking lots of questions to be picky.. no, in fact I was wanting to learn how this $9 goat dish I had was having such an effect on me... OOF!  BEST friggin $9 I've spent so far this year!!!  I could eat this all day!  Out from the kitchen where a Pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic, succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew... it was fantastic!  I love that they used the fat renderings with the garam masala to make this *heavenly* soupy deliciousness that was plentiful in the little container.... damn, I'm salivating just remembering it all over again.  SO, check out this place.  The guy was awesome but what stood out the most was their flavorful goat dish... the goat being the stand-out!   My sister's Chicken Tikka was also super flavorful, but mine was definitely more complex and interesting... now i just need another excuse to go to Tempe so I can relive this!

I found this place through a group get-together and it was exciting to know there was a good 'burger' place.  I ordered the 1/2# Bacon Cheeseburger with goat cheese on a lettuce bun.  The meat was well cooked and not overcooked (good, because overcooked is not enjoyable to me), it was moist and you could taste the difference I guess because of the coal they use rather than a griddle.  The bacon was thick and tasted fresh.  The lettuce was butter lettuce which is *perfect* for gripping, containing, and enveloping your burger and all its contents.  The cheese was great tasting.  Overall, I think I chose an awesome combination.  In my group was a child and I was a but surprised that when his "panko chicken strips" came out, they were burnt.. not dark brown, but burnt and one piece was shriveled burnt.  Good thing we caught it and she immediately took it back.  I think the servers were in their own little world and not paying attention because they should've caught that before it ever got to the customer.  Also, in my group - everyone else got their order way before I did and mine had no bun .. not sure why.  Overall, the place is new, clean, well decorated, great offerings and a great tasting burger!  I want to go back and try the shakes now.

I have to say that today marked the 2nd time I was disappointed with this place after having fallen for it with the first bite.  1-I have noted that they are inconsistent with their burger cooking - my first one was cooked perfectly (a slight pink); the next ones were either overcooked or WAY overcooked and tasted like cardboard. 2-Their servers do not do a good quality check with food coming out of the kitchen (and this is the 2nd time I've observed this - see first review); Our burgers, which both should have come with more toppings on them both did not have said toppings and the server didn't note this until I had to tell her.. which she then brought to us in the most meager quantities.  In the end, we both paid $9ea for a cardboard patty with meager ingredients and left feeling stiffed.  I can forgive oversights or rare one-offs, but when the food is not consistently cooked and ingredients are missing repeatedly, it tells me this place needs to work out the kinks before I want to give them my hard-earned cash again.  I appreciate that the manger came out and offered to comp my burger (but not my friend's, even though she got stuck w/ the same 'lump-of-coal burger patty' and missing ingredients as I did) and did so.. but I'm afraid I have given this place enough shots to know that I get more consistency at some other similarly-priced burger places in Chandler.

This was my first time at Frost and I was really impressed.  First off, it was Sat night, so the place was hoppin' and crowded.  None the less, the line moved really fast and the staff offering samples/tastings of everything were helpful and nice (usually, some places are stingy with samples, but here they weren't).  We chose the coconut and espresso and couldn't help but moan with every spoonful - so impressive!  They also had a young guy offering small glasses of water (to wash down the gelato) to patrons - nice touch!  The place is obviously popular and for a good reason - it's damn good Gelato!

I go to this part of town sometimes to visit.  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way).  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc).  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous... and the beans were yummy.  The owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie. prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there.  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness/neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here.  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow.. they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good.  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses...  I would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast.. especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product.. if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service...   Out of all the shady taco/burrito/tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators.

Nah, not a fan.  Yeah, the slices are big, but the toppings are meager on the pepperoni slices and it is just very plain and somehow I recall Slices was much more superior in flavor and quality.  It is crammed inside and the service was lacking.  THe kiddos we took today to eat there ate up their pizzas, but they were also very hungry... they did really enjoy the Jone's Soda we bought there.... that was about it.    Also, the name is stupid... Axxio?

I have to say that I am so delighted to have found a non-chain groomer for my lil guy that is so convenient and offers friendly service.  Dropped off my lil guy this evening for a full bath and grooming service - price was competitive at $40.  The staff was friendly and when I came for pick-up, I met the owner, who was very nice and warm.  Lil Jock looked great - he was trimmed properly for his breed and she commented that he behaved well even during nail trim (he totally dislikes getting his claws trimmed).  I really, really love that they don't put the pets in kennels but let them walk around the office.. the owner had a couple of her own dogs there lounging around making friends with the other dogs getting services - I thought that was a big plus!  My dog was very happy to see me when he saw me but I noted him relaxed through the windows before he even saw me (a really good sign for me).. didn't look nervous or anxious and wasn't pacing, looking for me.  I will definitely bring lil Jock here again for his next grooming.. 'cause daddy nicks his ears way too often and apparently I suck at coaxing him to let me trim his claws - they did a great job.

This is a great find.. so much so that I don't want to share the awesomeness!!!  Joking! We went there this summer with the family in tow.. lots of kiddos and lots of adults.  The line on a Saturday wasn't bad and the staff there are very quick and friendly.  The facilites are very well kept and in order and there are plenty of staff around the park to help you or to keep an eye on things.  The kiddos always have a blast here and get to burn some of that energy swimming, running, and being wild kids.  Downers are: no alcohol allowed (you can sneak it if you're good at it.. but be careful), no grilling available ( you have to bring your food already made or just eat before or just bring snacks).  If you get there even a bit late, good luck finding decent seating (for those adults wanting to sit and chit-chat in the shade while their kids run off to play in the water).  The best part: the lazy river!  I wanted to just ride that river the whole afternoon.. despite all the kids around you, it is relaxing and refreshing.  Overall, a great CHEAP way to entertain your kids in the summer! and for you to relax while they do it..

Been here maybe 2 or 3 times now and I'm a fan.  Well, considering there are really no other places to get my Colombian food fix... hehehe.. it makes sense to be a fan!  FIrst, this is a family run place so they are friendly and I've alway struck up a convo with the guy (Owner?) or even another guest.. always about Colombia, or favorite foods or memories of there.  I've had: arepas, empanadas, pan de quesos, licuados, chorizo, yuca.. some other things I don't recall, but pretty much I have tried to get everything on the menu.  I've been to Colombia 2x as an adult, most recently a couple years ago with my husband. The food in that country is just memorable.. so being able to taste it here, made very well by Colombians, makes it a treat to have.  I always get a licuado of any of the awesome fruits from there (I'm sure they use a concentrate because some of the fruits are hard to find, even at the Asian grocery stores), and an arepa... I love me some arepas.. warm corn with cheese .. yum! AND, if they ever have any of their bread (almojabana, bunuelos, pan de queso, pan de yuca), you NEED to get some.. they bring back so many memories for me.  If I'm ever in the area (which is quite rare, since it's pretty far from me), I absolutely make a point to eat here.. always!

Just with once eating here, I'm a big fan! The bagels taste incredibly fresh and have that perfect crust and chewy inside that Einstein or any other supposed "bagel" place can't match.   I ordered a crazy combo because im a pregnant, hungry mom! It was lox, bacon, and eggs with scallion cream cheese on a warm, freshly baked Everything Bagel. ....ahhhh,it was outstanding.   The guys working that fine early Sun morning were upbeat, fun and helpful. ..i think they must enjoy their job, which says a lot about the owners.   I'll def be back again when I'm on this side of the I10.

This is the 2nd time we come here and we are already huge fans!  The first time, the service was impressive - the bartender tended to us at our table an was not only really friendly and genuine, but knowledgeable and very helpful in wine and food pairing (we ordered the meat plate and it did not disappoint).  The 2nd time was an equally pleasing experience.  Our party of 7 got seated within a few minutes of arriving and our server gal was friendly, nice, and quick.  We went through several bottles of wine and the service was never slow or lacking (btw - they have an excellent Kim Crawford SB in the bottle section - recommend!).  A few of us had the vintage burgers and though I wasn't a big fan of the thick buns, i put them aside and found the meat and rest of the toppings very tasty and highly filling.  The ambiance was perfect - they had live music (a beautiful and talented gal on her guitar) and she chose perfect songs for the venue and the fireplace was going.  The owner stopped by to say hello and everything was all good.  We are fans and will return again!

Had a flavorful meal last night for my sister's b-day dinner.  She had the green chile pork burger, I had the Ahi tuna salad and my other sister had the shrimp tacos.  I'd have to say that the portions were small, compared to the typical-American-serving.. which is nice, but not so good when you are famished (which we all were, in anticipation for 'dinner out' in Arcadia).  My Ahi portion was quite small (I'm pretty sure less than 4oz) but the salad and the dressing combination were an explosion of pure delight in my mouth.. tart cherries, crispy yucca and bitter arugula topped with soy ginger vinaigrette was such a delight!  My sister's also boasted about the flavor of their meal.  Truly tasty food.  The ambiance was pretty quiet, but then again it was Monday night.. and the lighting was a bit awkward where we were seated at.. I had this shining halogen bulb right in my direction and it was awkward.  Our server gal was nominal, friendly, but short with convo.  I wanted a Belgian beer, but they were out, so I nixed the beer idea (I know, I'm a turd, I should've just had some)  and got a Spanish Garnacha which was delicious.  My sisters enjoyed their sip of it.  I'll definitely be coming back for some more tasty food :)

Happened to walk by on our way back from froyo nearby and decided to walk in and check it out.  The staff was really friendly (I was surprised at the young gal's very warm welcome.. good job... just a tad startling.. but good job!).  There was a lot of 'boutique' clothes there.. not clothes I typically shop for, but I was drawn immediately to their jewelry (more my thing) since I like one-off pieces to wear.  One of the sales gals was very helpful and stood next to me the whole time as I looked at the Lenny & Eva straps and charms they had .. she was really friendly and helpful and talkative and all.. these gals know customer service.  I liked the Lenny & Eva jewelry and had already decided I wanted to get a set, just wanted to figure out what combination I liked best (they are mix & match design) and she was very helpful.  The sets are pretty pricey, but it's a boutique and so these pieces are hand-made and seem one-off, so I can see why the price point for the L&E jewelry was higher than, say, Made-in-China Sears stuff (bah! what a horrid comparison, right?).  Overall, they have quie a bit of things to look at.. if you don't plan on shopping, at least it's entertaining to browse through the unique offerings they have.  I'd go back to buy a unique or one-off gift..

I first heard of Boho at the Yelp Pley Date event this year.  The couple had goat cheese and also some yummy marmalades/jams.  She gave me a pamphlet for the Garden Tour and so from that, I was pulled in to the world of Phoenix's very own residential garden world... who knew it was growing like this!  Visited Boho Farm & Home today and felt like I was taken away in to some distant retreat that was NOT in Arizona.  Yes, it was hot, but the beautiful gardens, adorable animals, and gorgeous outdoor living space made me feel like I was not in hot Arizona.  So green was their farm - there was so much going on and I had a lot of fun figuring out what each plant and tree was (and what food it bore).  The chickens were free-roaming and it was just a very welcoming backyard farm experience.  They also had their products for sale (jams, etc) as well as served a yummy lavender-infused drink... very nice gifts for the moms in your life (Mother's day is tomorrow).  If you can take a tour, do it!  It's beautiful and not like anything you'll see in any AZ backyard.. it simply takes you away.

On my recent flight to South Bend, IN, I flew through this Mesa Airport.  I stopped by this place because I wanted a sit-down meal and perhaps a glass of wine.  The gals attending there were friendly and attentive and quick, they did not have that same airport worker drone attitude that big airport service employees have.. .which was a pleasant treat.  I was even more impressed with the delicious and lush Rex-Goliath PN they served me in a beautiful, clean, sleek wine glass.  The spinach salad was huge, colorful and plentiful with chicken, goat cheese, pecans, and a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  Very impressed for an "airport" establishment when this type of quality is usually not the case: Friendly staff, bright and fresh salad with plenty of ingredients, great wine!  Too bad there isn't one of these in Terminal 4 or Terminal 2 :(

I had a fantastic time today driving my childhood fantasy car, the Lambo (not my Diablo, but the Gallardo)!  Global Exotic hosted this awesome experience (that runs today and tomorrow) at the Firebird Int'l Raceway nearby that was probably one of the most exciting and thrilling opportunities to drive some high-class beauties on a racetrack.  On Groupon, they posted a $500 driving experience for less than a 3rd of the cost - killer deal!.  The deal was: drive 4laps (~4m) of the raceway in either a Gallardo, a 911, a Maserati GT, or a F430 with photos and driving instructions.  I imagined that the F430 would be the most popular, and it sure was.  Supposedly, these cars are from their rental lot, so I did have to take out extra insurance for the day (not bad, ~$40)... just in case April got a little too throttle happy and plowed in to barricades.    When I arrived, check-in was seamless, though I did have to wait about 45min longer because they were running behind of schedule.  Once called back, the instructor gave a very quick (~5min) and brief overview of the track and basic rules and whatnot.. then off to the line for Lambo.  Lucky me, I only had to wait for 2 guys (yes, as usual, I was the only girl in our group to pay $200 to drive a high-class beauty)... then it was my turn.  Ahhhhhh, the exhilaration!.. the heart races, the palms grip 3 and 9o'clock .. and the throttle is engaged!  Ah, dare I say it was orgasmic??  All the staff was top-notch - clearly there for you to have a good time yet keeping safety in mind.  The instructor in my car was friendly and helpful and definitely let me make the experience about what *I* wanted to get out of it.. he was great!  .. a song comes to mind: "If I was rich girl.. nah nah nah nah nan nah nah nah nah nan nah nah nah nah nah..."  If I was a rich girl, this little Gallardo would come home with me tonight ;)  Definitely an 'as good as it gets' experience brought to you by Global Exotic!!

What can you say about a Target that isn't already known... well, for starters I am SO GLAD they put this new Target in this place.  It is way more convenient for me and I love the newness of it and the added grocery section that make 'a quick run' to pick up necessities really 'quick'.  Staff has always been pleasant... their racks of clothes are always plentiful, especially the clearance area.  I pretty much buy everything from Target unless I need bulk (costco) or specialty (sprouts/whole foods)... I stay as far away from WM as I possibly can!

What an outstanding opening party today... on St. Patty's day, none the less! They opened for a select group of visitors from 2-6pm today and it included wine/beer and bruschetta for a cost of $25.  What a way to start off in the neighborhood!  I noted an excellent staff - friendly, prompt, and definitely well prepared for the onset of traffic that has been long awaiting the opening of this place.  Even when there were gobs of people in line for food and drink, they were kind, smiley and very up-beat.  The food was, as always, outstanding.  Great bruschetta variety and an impressive display of wines.  I'm excited this opened up in our neighborhood and I can't wait to come here again!

I recently had my baby shower party here in their back room (I was so happy they had a room all to ourselves!) and I was very, very impressed with their service!  My girls arrived at 10:30 to setup since we had it starting at 11am and the staff was friendly and helpful even with helping carry things in.  Our server, Valerie, was very attentive, sweet and quick.  The place itself is very cute and since it kind of went with my theme of 'natural/wildlife', it was an ideal setting... all the decor was spot on and we had very little to decorate for the event (the back room is very well decorated in that sense).  We hosted Sangrias and Tea/Lemonade as well as Appetizers and Lavash Pizzas (basically everything) and with the 10 girls, it came out to $13 a person which was pretty perfect, especially since it included alcohol (the girls ordered whatever drinks they wanted).  The girls afterward said they had a great time, especially since the pizzas were so good (and the sangrias)... I'm happy they liked the food.  This was a great place to host a party and the price point was perfect, too... decor was in-line with our theme and the staff was 5 stars!  I recommend this place :)

2nd time trying their food at the Chandler Food Truck night, very much enjoyed it. My first try was the Lamb fry bread which i thought was going to taste "lamby", so i told the guy "you gave me carne asada, this isn't lamb" and he explained it was mutton and not the same lamby flavor. ..ok, took his word for it. Next time i got the cane adobada with beans in a fry bread. .it was delicious!   I did need to add salt to my fry bread but other than that, the flavor was very very good. ..and filling!

I couldn't rate this place until my 2nd go around only because my first time was take-out.  That being said, I did get the same thing both times and am pretty sure I can say I enjoy their Pulled Pork portion and would get it again.  It is moist, soft, and flavorful all on its own, but I do enjoy drizzling some Sissy sauce on it.  I've also had their corn-on-the-cob twice and found it super plain and not even sweet or enjoyable.. totally blah for me with the corn.  They use real butter, though, so if I liked their corn, I'd be a fan of that.  I'll stick to the pulled pork.  On to their BBQ sauce: I am not a big fan of a few things, mainly how they serve the sauce, which is in a large diameter *glass* bottle with a bottle pourer (the kind bartenders used to control the flow of alcohol when pouring)... no bueno. It took me a long while to get a quarter size sauce on to my pork and it was just frustrating.. and the glass makes it non-squeezable.. and the huge bottle makes it heavy to hold while you're waiting for gravity to help you get that little dab of sauce out and on to your meat... yeahhh, it was that annoying.  Here's an idea: make your sauce fresh and then put it in big ass jars than we can either portion out ourselves (like Joe's Real BBQ) or put it in squeezable bottles (like Famous Dave's)... *anything* but giant glass bottles with pourer restrictors on... puhleeeeze!  Their staff is very friendly, the ambiance is very relaxed and totally casual, pic-nic-style seating and, of course, country.  They have a great concept of huge coolers of booze (beer) where you can pick out your beer and put it in a bucket.. they also have sody-pop and sweet tea.    Country music on the speakers.... yummy pulled pork... buckets of cold beer... pic-nic seating.. that's what I enjoyed.

So I pass by this corner *all* the time and I never knew this place even existed.  I had to find out from Yelp... that's not good marketing.  Hubby was in the mood for Joe's BBQ last night and so to break out of the routine of going to Gilbert for our BBQ fix, I convinced him to try this place out, quoting some of the remarks fellow Yelpers had provided.    He ordered the 3 meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork) and I had (stupidly!!!) the Asian Pork Salad... FYI: DON'T BOTHER getting this salad: it was soggy with sugary dressing, the "mixed greens" were literally iceberg lettuce with about 5-10 leaves of spring mix, the peppers were barely there and so was the pork portion.  I was very disappointed and, frankly, peeved that I chose that when I should've just gone with my instinct of a pulled-pork sandwich.  Whatever...  Hubby's meats were tasty - we both noted the brisket was very dry and had to load it with BBQ.  I tried the pulled pork from his platter and loved the bark.. dark, crispy, fatty, yummy, sweet.. good stuff.  I know what I'm getting next time!  Hubby however, was not as impressed with the meats - said they were good, but still thinks Joe's can't be beat.  He says that if you want to hang out with your buddies to have some cold brews and good BBQ, this is your place... but if you're focus is great BBQ, he says to stick with Joe's.  Oh yeah and you need to try the Mac & Cheese - the best I've ever had... creamy, cheesy, bits of non-cheese flavoring that are exciting and addicting.  Also, they served ice cold Firestone IPA - delish!  Service was nice and so was the ambiance.  I am a fan of the mac n cheese and the pork bark here, but hubby is still a Joe's believer... so, there you have it.

Just finished Arcadia's Edible Garden Tour and really enjoyed learning about and seeing such a fantastic home-garden & mini-farm setup here.  As part of the tour, this small business opened up their in-city farm to those wanting to learn how to start their own gardens/small farms.  This particular location has a pretty standard size Arizona backyard and really demonstrated how much food and goods you can produce out of a small residential space with a well-thought out system.  Their front yard was LOADED with beds of peppers, swiss chard, tomatoes, kale, corn, cabbage... you name it!  And all that with an impressive irrigation and organized bed system (this is their specialty!).  The backyard had 20 or so beautiful, robust chickens as well as two goats (for milking).  The gal that runs this place was very friendly and totally helpful with questions and showing you around.  I think their main business is not necessarily their garden/farm (though they do have a CSA), but it looks like their speciality is in doing customized gardens in other's homes and backyards.  They also sell organically grown heirloom seedlings and seeds.  Impressive use of space, to say the least and definitely where I'd start for pointers and consultation.

This review is solely about their 'Navajo' taco.. aka "Indian Fry Bread".  I've only had this dish (carne asada) here and probably will stick to ordering this as it is plentiful, tasty, and repeatedly enjoyable. My sis ordered their pork 'fry bread' and I was disappointed because I asked the chef guy if it was shredded and he said yes (me thinks he don't know what he be takin' bout) ... it was cubed and not as flavorful as my carne asada.. mine was delish! The young girl at the front was nice and their place seems really clean and since it's finally a locally owned restaurant that *doesn't* suck in S Chandler (everything around here is a chain), I am officially a FAN :)

I really liked my visit today... been needing professional shoes for work.  The young gal was very attentive to me and brought me shoes I had indicated I was looking for in my size.  I liked a style that they didn't carry (bummer) but could order, so she was able to order it for me and... voila! I should be getting my new Dansko pair by Wed! free shipping!  All 3 staff persons were very friendly and by no means pushy or anything of the sort.. actually very educational.  I will be back if I need to buy comfort shoes in the future.

I can't believe I'm barely writing this reviews!  This place goes down as one of those "must visit again" spots.  I really enjoyed just about every aspect of our visit here a month or so ago.    It's a small joint, well-staffed (we were very well tended to!), friendly, delicous menu, decently priced, and overall a memorable meal experience.  Hubby had the Breakfast Burrito (a crepe, actually) and though this man can eat, he couldn't even finish it.. Note however that I had a bite of it and wasn't jumping for joy like I was with mine: I had the Chicken Pesto crepe which was *outstanding*.. plenty of pesto and chicken and this delcious cheese crispyness on the edges of my crepe... my mouth was excited and anticipating the next bite!  We also split one of their sweet crepes to see how those tasted and we were not disappointed: the creme brulee crepe with fresh berries and candied fruit was impressive.. simple yet every bite was special and exciting in the mouth.  I really liked their friendliness, LOVED their crepes and appreciated their business venture.. I love supporting local businesses, especially when they make awesome food you want more and more of.  I'll definitely be back!

I have to say that two years after my first review, I'm impressed they've continued deserve big stars. . Most small,  hip, joints tend to become so popular and over worked, they have snippy staff,  subpar food, and an air of contempt for the customer. .. not here! Came to breakfast with hubby and our 13mo old (not the best idea, given they only own one high chair :/ and we had to ask the other family not using theirs if we could use it).     We both had heart drip coffee along with our meals. .i had the Grand Prix, which, if you are a pig lover, i urge you to see if it's available. .. it was so flavorful and had these great contrasting flavor combinations of coffee, maple, smoked pork. ..I'm salivating as i recall it now. I didn't try my husband's, papa k, but he enjoyed it. . Though i think mine was more memorable!   Great service,  memorable food,  cute and functional decor. .. definitely a place worth frequenting.

I was SO happy to see this place come to Phoenix.. my memories of lunch at Potbelly's in Dearborn, MI were re-lived with the delicious and unmistakably fantastic sandwich that is the Italian... had one last night and they did not disappoint.  This place is going to get visited by people that have, at one point in their life, experienced a wonderful, warm, toasted, slightly dripping with mayo sandwich that is a Potbelly's and so those that are used to eating crap like Subway are not going to "get it"...  in the case that you do appreciate the craft and combinations of flavors, try the Italian - the blend of meats and the combination of toppings (get them all) make for a flavor explosion in your mouth.  I can only eat half a sandwich, it's that filling.  I have the other half in the fridge right now that I will re-toast in the toaster oven so I can enjoy it allll over again. Eat that, Subway.  PS: The staff was very nice, as always, and friendly and talkative and the place inside is decorated with such care and attention to detail.

I'm adding this to my list of places for lunch.  We went on a weekday at 11:45am and though there was about 5 ppl in front of us, we really didn't wait very long to submit our order and to get our food.  This place was quite busy already and got almost crowded by the time we had finished our meal... so, tip: come before noon!  I am a huge Italian sandwich fan and it is usually what I use to determine if I'll return to a 'sub/sandwich' kind of place... well, WW did not disappoint.  I loved the extreme customization (literally, you pick everything out) and the ease of ordering on the little paper bag - genius!  I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and even took a picture of my paper bag to know what to get next time.  My two friends that accompanied me to lunch also enjoyed their sandwich... plus, at just under $6 for a filling sandwich, it can't be beat.  I recommend stopping by this place and enjoying a custom sandwich... oh yeah, staff was very helfpul and quick, too.

I loved my experience tonight. And this sort of experience tells you that this is how this place runs. .always.   House made bread, mayo... real fat, real sugar, real food. .. the chefs make it all here!   The highlights were the BLT, chicharrones (holy shit, they're delicious), their sandwich bread, their mayo, the carrot cake. I could've tried more but fat is very satiating, so you don't have to pig out to feel full, just the bites I had left an impression on me...though maybe I did "pig out".haha   I admit there was a bit of a glitch in the birthday girls meal, but they were quick to remedy it, comp it and offer us desert on the house, no hesitation.  That's what I liked: no hesitation, just fix it. .and they did.   Waiter was on the ball and atmosphere was relaxed, not Scottsdale pretentious. .. nice place, I'll definitely be back!

I'm VERY glad this place opened up around this intersection.  To be completely honest, this intersection in Chandler/Gilbert is the least attractive to me as an eater/foodie... I've tried EVERY eating place at this intersection and the few we ever return to (though not lately since I prefer to just cook my own foodie obsessions at home) are not even anything special.  Having said that, I have eaten here maybe 2 or 3 times already (during the weekend, when momma doesn't feel like cooking so much) and I REALLY love their Italian sandwich... like, I've craved it very often since having it the first time.  It is warm/toasted, plenty of Italian meats (though I do suggest if you don't like the sweetness of their honey ham, you can have them add less and more of another italian meat.. which they gladly do).. and I love biting in to the crispy yet soft bread and getting melted mayo and italian meat juice all over my face :P  It is the stuff of cravings for me.  The staff here is friendly, chipper, nice... they have a bajillion soda selections (though I don't drink soda.. haven't for years...) and you can donate a bit of your bill to the local Fire Station.  I definitely return here.

My husband and I are fans of this place...  for what it's meant to be: a food truck, family owned/operated, in South Phoenix, serving typical mexican dishes, but mostly known for their Birria, it is pretty good.    ALL of the clientele is local Mexican families ....and all your utensils are cheap plastic.. parking is a dirt lot... the plastic tables may have some flies abuzzing around.. cash only... Spanish only...  but their Birria is damn good and all their toppings (cilantro, onions, home made corn tortillas) are tasty and look fresh/clean.  The two guys that take your order are welcoming, quick, and get the job done.  The food comes out quick, hot, and tasty.... never had a complaint about the food being too much bones or too much fat or not enough this or that... and even better, I've never gotten sick from eating here!  That's gotta mean something, right?  oh yeah, had their huevos rancheros and their avocado was fresh and their beans were yummy... okay, I'm ready to eat this again....

It's been a while since i had Indian Buffet, there aren't too many options in Chandler. I was having some craving for it, though, so i decided I'd have lunch there since my kiddo was with grandma for the after noon.   The place inside is nice, good decor, dark and a little intimate. The gal that seated me and attended to me was friendly and prompt with water and picking up after my plate.   The buffet had many options, which i was a bit impressed with that finding.  I can't remember what all they had but i had several meat dish options and several meatless ones as well. I didn't get to try all of them but i did put on my plate at least 5 things to taste. I enjoyed the flavors of all but can't say any of them made me want to get up and keep going. ..except the spinach. .i really really liked that dish.   I think i always compare Indian buffets to the only one I've ever eaten at consistently and for the longest period of time: Delhi Palace. This tikka masala was not as good as DP,  nor was the Tandoori chkn.  I think their gulab jamun is canned ;'-( here. .. they were not perfectly round, but dented like the kind bought the other day from the local Indian market.  That was disappointing :(  Overall: I'd come back if i wanted a conveniently located solution to my Indian cravings, but it likely isn't my go-to spot like DP.

Drive thru gourmet burger place? hell yah! Stopped here a few times while I was going to my weekly appointment nearby and was very impressed.. I've only ever ordered the burger.. add the yummy Niman Ranch bacon (extra, but seriously worth it) and I'm in la la land!  Their staff is very friendly and the food is made to order, seasoned *perfectly* and above all, delicious.  OH yeah, the fries are awesome... perfectly seasoned and just like I like them.

Ok, definitely Freaky Fast...doesn't make it any better than a Subway or Blimpie in my opinion. These subs are bland. .. bland bland bland.  I've tried a few over the course of a couple years, only out of convenience and i JUST DON'T GET IT...nothing special, nothing I'd ever crave or reminisce over. .. just a cold sub that is made freakishly fast..   1.75 stars for being super fast and a good size of plain sandwich.

This isn't really far from where I frequent so I guess for all the other reviewers who say "it's not really worth the drive", I'd say for me it kinda was.  Yes, a lot of stores not yet open, but when I did go to find things I was looking for a deal on (baby clothes and a new watch), I found them - so I can't say I didn't see any 'deals'.  Didn't make it to all the stores, but I really enjoyed my Fossil shopping experience (good prices and lots of BOGO offers and 20 and 25% off deals on beautiful leather goods that were in my price range)... also walked in to Heartstrings and found adorable sports wear for newborns for Ross prices but a way better selection and very friendly owner and staff.  Like I said, I found deals for what I was looking for so I was happy.  Since this is close to me, I'd come again... I enjoyed the outdoor walk, liked the store options, and feel like I would be able to find deals here again in the future.  Note that their food-court area is very minimally set up so far...

So honey and I wanted a lunch out one fine Sunday afternoon.. so, with our baby in tow, we hit this joint up.  Not busy, so we got seated promptly.. outdoor in their patio area with the great weather. Our server guy was great - very friendly, talkative, prompt and gave good recommendations.  I had the spiked Horchata (with Frangelico) and hubby had on-tap beer. His three tacos came out and, unfortunately, I didnt' get a chance to taste them but he appeared to enjoy them as I didn't hear a word otherwise.  My dish, the cochinito pibil torta was SOOO GOOD... that pineapple slaw was a perfect accompaniment and they *perfectly* buttered and toasted the soft, yummy torta the way I would! I thoroughly enjoyed that torta and really really liked the horchata.. grainy the way real home-made horchata is. I'd definitely come back, though not that regularly as it is a bit pricey for regular eating out for me.

I don't frequent Chipotle because they pretty much have the same thing all the time.. not that that's a bad thing, just that I can get bored quickly.  When I do go, I do like to get their 2 soft corn tacos with beef or pork, which is marinated perfectly.  They are a bit stingy with the meat servings, but I guess I understand that if they are using "hormone free" (as they claim, but you never really are sure) meat.  I usually make it up with added fajitas, lettuce, salsa, etc.. then my tacos get really fat and filling.  The staff is nice and quick and gets my order done correctly.  This location can get really busy and have a long line at lunch (figures, a lot of people love Chipotle), but if you do the phone or online order, you can run in and pay and be out in a jiff.

Wow, only one review here... that's crazy when I know SO many of my co-workers and friends eat here!  OK, so be ready to wait in a long that goes alllll the way to the patio if you come during lunch time... not too slow of a line, but still enough to drive me away or just make me plan on coming earlier than 12.  Their staff here changes a lot so I can't really speak for any of them as far as their friendliness or quickness, but overall, when you've ordered, they are pretty damn quick at getting you out.. which is very helpful when you dont' want to kill a whole hour for work lunch.  I would say that my only complaint is the 'natural' claims on their proteins.. this is not always the case and rarely do they actually post the signs that say "sorry, we have conventional X/Y/Z".  I totally understand that the good stuff runs out but I'm pretty sure it happens often, so when I don't see the sign often, I'm sure they're just not putting it up when they should.  But Chipotle is a great option for people looking to have a more healthy eating experience.. I usually stick to the 2 or 3 (If i'm feeling super hungry) tacos on soft corn with all the fixins.. that or the salad with any of the meats.  Those two are the only things I ever order.. never been disappointed with those.

I'd come back here for a few reasons. ... A. The staff,  waiter and host, we're very helpful, quick and accommodating with everything B. The burgers we ordered were huge and very very tasty, not to mention I adored the duck fat fries and I'm not a big fry person (I'll rarely order them)..my son really enjoyed his kids quesadilla. C. You'd never think this place was family friendly but there were plenty of families,  just like us, so it was comfortable to have my 2yo with us and he attracted no unwarranted attention being loud, walking loose, messy, etc. D. If i weren't preggo, I'd have enjoyed the Tasting Room and the list of tasty on tap beers they had.   Well def come again another time.

We got a flyer for this in our mail, so decided to give this local joint a shot.  Hubby ordered the Hawaiian and I the Sausage and Peppers... I was expecting something to match the photos from Yelp but was, unfortunately, disappointed that my pizza had raw peppers and a very soggy center... so bad that every slice from my pizza split in two from the sogginess... bummer.  The flavor of both was also pretty bland - nothing special. The place itself is nice and modern-decor and clean... and staff was very friendly and prompt with the phone order and the completion....  I think the idea is great, but the execution was very lacking. Not sure if I"ll eat there again... not impressed.

I really enjoyed this place with just one visit.  The staff runs pretty efficiently in making your personally-selected ingredients and bringing it out to you quickly.  They have good combinations or you can build-your-own.  I had the chicken pesto and they were plentiful with all ingredients.. my son and I enjoyed every bite and I look forward to visiting here again.

I was hesitant to buy my cloth diapers here... I assumed that because it was a brick and mortar store, I'd pay a premium for things I could easily find online.  I am happy to say I'm a convert.. not only are they staffed with friendly, knowledgeable staff, but they are very helpful, have never ever been pushy and best part? Their prices are great - seriously! comparable to amazon on several occasions.  Now, I happily go here when I need any stock or extra supplies of cloth diaper items... their 'house' brand, Bumkins, is now my favorite! Beautifully sown, great quality, hold in all my son's fluids and they are a great value!  The owner has been there on several occasions and is a bountiful source of tips, tricks and lots of diapering knowledge.  I think this is truly as good as it gets!

Ok, i was really really craving donuts. ...so here i decided, being 8mo pregnant and really craving something memorable,  that i wanted to taste a few here. At 1.98 apiece, i figured they might be a bit special since I'm always hearing about this place from folks I follow on IG. Anyyywayyyy, stopped by and the gentleman with the 'stache kindly explained to me, as a newbie, how it worked. So i went with the OC, the strawberry shortcake and the salted one. The batter for these cake donuts is pretty good and really, that's about as sweet as I'd like my donut. .add on the other toppings and i was just past enjoying them and kinda done with them after just a bite of each. The strawberry one was the least favorite of mine. .it was kinda yuck. The other two were more enjoyable but still very very sweet. Honestly, i can't even think of which other ones I'd like to  try, none of the other  combos interested me :/ I'm glad i tried it, just to remove the mystery in my mind...  maybe I'm just not their target customer, too sweet sweet sweet for me.

I can't say I wasn't warned. .. The half fuji chicken salad was a puny portion of maybe a .5c of white (not green) lettuce... so small it took half of my small container. How do you jip on the freaking lettuce is beyond me but at least the toppings were proportional to a half salad.  My chicken chipotle panini was chewy bread, about the thickness of a credit card. . Maybe trying to heat up the cheese quickly so use of the thinnest, chewy bread?..? The panini had at least decent flavor combinations.  The cashier was very nice. .. the place looks nice.  Definitely feel like they're making Paradise Bakery look bad. ..i wasn't in love with Paradise but at least they were decent on salad portions and ratios.   Bummer... close to my hood but not likely part of my repertoire.

I have been to other locations but I'm by no means a regular. Well let's just say today I'm officially NOT a customer.  Ordered a BBQ Cheddar Bacon ... it come out flat, not cut like I requested and no haystack fries. It absolutely looked like it was thrown together as an after thought and like they said "eh, fuq it, it's a to-go order". Well fuq that. I don't eat at Burger King but this might as well been from there - zero quality control and zero effort ..cept i paid 7$!!!  I asked them what was up with that and the guy nicely talked to me but at no point did he say sorry, we messed up and we'd like to make it up. Never did he say sorry. I got 2 ducking coupons from him. . Coupons. Yeah. Fuq that.

I should have followed my instincts and avoided this location for the more calm location on Gilbert & Germann.  We showed up for a late Sat night showing.. walked in to a really packed theater and luckily were able to find seating in the upper section (or un-luckily as you'll see).  Because it was so packed, I got stuck sitting next to Joe Dirt and his trailer-park girlfriend.. who wouldn't stop talking through the movie and making out the whole time... DISgusTING.  Yuk... nothing like watching the Hunger Games to wet kissing and trailer-park PDA right next to you. Ufff  The rest of the atmosphere was OK, but this place is so busy (even on a late night showing) that I now know better and will avoid it if I want to a) park easily and b) not wait in line for tickets and c) not deal with such a crowded theater.
