Overall, I was not impressed. The chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was not chunky, and my meal was so...lackluster. I ordered the Flautas Plate...which consisted of two, what seemed like microwaved, chicken flautas, rice, beans and some guacamole. The flautas were more like taquitos that you buy in the freezer section, the rice was good and was really the only thing I enjoyed, the beans were standard re-fried and the guacamole was quite bland. The other three people I was with all ordered burritos and really enjoyed their meal...so I'm thinking the flautas are not the shining star at Restaurant Mexico.

I had an awesome time at The Big Bang. We didn't stand in line, only paid a $3 cover, and found a good spot down by the pianos. The musicians are unbelievable. Not only can they play every instrument, they know all the words to every song. I was impressed to say the least. I would say the prices of the drinks are a little expensive for a college bar...$5 for a Bud Lite?? Really? Where I went to college, I paid $5 for a pitcher of Bud Lite. My only complaints were the stickiness of floors and they didn't play my song "Fat Bottom Girls". Boo.
