Nestled in Mesa, Hodori was a great find for solid Korean food! My friends and I ordered the Bulkogi(Korean BBQ), Tonkatsu, and Dumplings! Man were we amazed the sauce lathered on the pork Tonkatsu was delicious with the egg salad and cole slaw! The pork was breaded to perfection and served like a fancy restaurant style etiquette! The dumplings were great in soup with the yummy rice cakes which were moist and chewy, a pleasant delight! The main attraction the Bulkogi was great with the rice and Kimchi/other side dishes served! Also, the server was delightful and so attentive and caring. My friend had dropped his chopstick and the waiter noticed and brought him a new set in seconds! Great location too near Asiana Market, Chinese food nearby and other Asian food eateries in the vicinity. Glad I found this treasure in Mesa, due to the lack of many quality Asian restaurants! I will definitely be back and plan to further taste the other awesome choices on the menu!  Service 5/5  Food 5/5  Courteousness 5/5  Waiting time 5/5  Ambiance 5/5

Although I went to high school out in Tempe, I never attended ASU or went to this esteemed spot. Remember if you visit the Chuck Box, they only accept cash! Now if you're looking for an amazing char grilled burger, this is the hottest spot near Mill! The burger was tender and juicy, with the meat seared to perfection on the char set up! The size is hefty and it is cooked to perfection on the flame. As a burger afficionado, this was definitely up there as one of the best! Beware of the long lines and wait, but the food is totally worth it! The fries were awesome as well! I had friends driving through AZ from another state and they agreed that the burger was spectacular. Chuck Box you win! Just wished I visited this place sometime earlier in the last 10 years during my time in Tempe!

Overlooking the mediterranean sea, Phoenicia lies in the quaint Phoenix suburb of Gilbert, Arizona. As a native of this city, I have craved good/any Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food for over 10 years! With a great location at the civic center, I was drawn to this location when driving by it multiple times as I did not dare to challenge the Arizona heat on a blistering summer day.  Entering Phoenicia a few months ago for the first time, I was hesitant due to my unfamiliarity with the restaurant. Since that point, I can honestly say simply amazing. This evening I had the Shish Kafta with Tabouleh and fries. The kafta was seared to perfection with the accompanying Tahini sauce. Coming from a person who normally does not rave about salads, I LOVED the Tabouleh! The parsley, tomato and vinaigrette combination was a refreshing burst of flavor!  We also ordered the rack of lamb meal. As a connoisseur of lamb, this was just amazing!! Soft and well-done, I became an instant fan of this delicacy! While the food was great, who can forget the guava juice. The juice was just an awesome sweet beverage for this tasty meal.   In terms of service, I was extremely impressed. The waiters were very accommodating and consistently checking in on the quality of our dining experience. I must say the service was as good as the food with the exuberant staff on hand!  Next time, I intend to expand my horizons and look to try their Baba Ghanouj or baklava. I'm sure that if their other menu options were as excellent as my meal, I will soon become a regular of this fine establishment!  Food: 5/5  Service: 5/5  Atmosphere: 5/5

I  decided to check this place out since it's conveniently located in the AZ center. I ordered the fish tacos lunch special. I must say that I was not pleased with my meal for the hefty price of $11. The tacos simply had tilapia pieces and were somewhat dry in flavor. There was some type of sauce but the taste of the tacos was sorely lacking. In fact, the rice and beans dappered with feta cheese were a much better option in my estimation. Even worse, the wait to receive a take out lunch order or rice, beans and these fish tacos took about 35 minutes. Based on the meal I received, the wait seemed to be a bit excessive so the service was lacking in the regard. Since I ordered the food to go, I could have sat down and the wait would have been approximately the same.   Normally, I've had very positive experiences with this restaurant at its various locations, but today I was unfortunately disappointed. I hope in the future this could improve for future customers.  Service 2/5  Food 2.5/5  Price 2/5  Setting 5/5(but I ordered to go)

Although I have been to this restaurant quite a few times, I was very impressed with how they accommodated our group of 10 without any hassle! For a group setting near by ASU(college campus) in Tempe, the food is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed! We ordered a number of dishes but I really enjoyed the zesty chicken manchurian and biryani as I usually order these dishes! Aside from these courses, I enjoyed the shrimp curry and butter chicken side items as well for the generous serving of thali! Also SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT BECAUSE THE lassis, kulfi, ice cream etc are worth the post-meal scrumptuousness! I plan to come back in the future and give the lamb-based dishes a try in the near future and optimally check out the popular lunch buffet option!

Mojo was a good night cap to an evening on the town in Tempe Marketplace! The soft serve ice cream choices were great. Personally, I went a bit overboard and mixed the original, caramel and vanilla ice creams with butterfinger mix, gummy bears, candy, and a host of other goodies. The price can be a bit excessive depending on the weight of the total amount of material, but it is well worth it. Throw that in with nice outdoor seating and a great location, this place is pretty solid!

So this Harkins is especially great with the courteous staff and great screens! The popcorn and my usual ICEE were on point! Saw the Avengers: Age of Ultron here and don't know what was more epic, the movie or the theater! Seriously though, if you have younger children especially this is a nice location to visit the mall, go shopping, then checking out an evening flick to top off the day! I will definitely be back to this great Mall and Harkins!

This Basha's is great! The staff are friendly, helpful, and even pretty funny! They facilitate the process of grocery shopping and make it fast! I always enjoy going to this location and stopping by the Panda Express or Great Clips! In the future, I will be back for my last minute food and weekend needs!

For small town Gilbert, San Tan is an awesome mall. The location off the 202, fun crowd and wide smorgasbord of stores available make this an awesome spot to chill and meet up with friends! On this particular Friday, I had the pleasure of attending Avengers: Age of Ultron at Harkins. I was not disappointed! Ambient sound, good lively audience and great mall service. I will be back!(for Terminator 4 etc)

Ok so I've had the Dim Sum here 4x and just been too lazy to write a review so here it is. Amazing food, great prices if you go with a group and very good service. The food just keeps coming and the quality/diversity in dishes cannot be overstated. Try the black beef, sweet rolls, tea, and seafood items. The location is great too because it is in an awesome Asian food/general marketplace with shops so after your meal you can wander around for a unique cultural experience. This is definitely a must visit location with friends and a group to have a fantastic eating experience!

This place is the gem of Vegas!! For all your late night meals Laurita's California Burrito is affordable and darn good! If you are running low on cash/want a quick bite late at night, Laurita's is your place. Great menu options(over 20+) and service is prompt and courteous. The food feels authentic and makes you want to return after long days/nights on the Strip being open 24 hours a day. All day everyday meal status in Vegas!

Good spot, and a great selection of drinks for an evening on the town. The place can be a bit busy especially on the weekends, but I appreciate the service and promptness of the employees. The food items are great to accompany the wide drink menu! Definitely going to visit in the future!

Alright since I live in Arizona I have always passed by this place on my way to Harkins in Mesa, so I decided a pre Jurassic World meal at this location would be worth a try. I was greeted by a welcoming service but the food paled in comparison. I ordered the 2 piece thigh and wing combo with mac and cheese. Sadly, the mac and cheese was the best part of the meal. The chicken was dry and had no classic el pollo loco taste to it for a good kick to the meal. I had doubts unfortunately whether the meat was well cooked during my experience. Additionally, the portion was extremely small for a hefty $7 within a fast food setting and I was left famished after my meal. Based on the crowd within the restaurant consisting of me, myself and I, I understood the paucity of individuals at this restaurant.   In the future, I hope the quality of food within this establishment is vastly improved, otherwise I'm afraid my sentiments will be echoed in similar fashion.

Since I pass by this place on the way to work everyday, I decided to give it a shot instead of the starbucks nearby! I was very pleased with the service and quality of my medium Kicker! The drink was sooo tasty with the hint of Irish Cream! It didn't hurt that the staff was super friendly and energetic at such an early hour in the morning! Also, Beware of the insane lines in the drivethru! Might be faster to just go up in person and wait in the smaller queue in person! Next time, I plan to try the very popular Carmelizer or Cocomo(coconut flavored!). I will definitely be back soon as the hype is definitely justified! Best coffee spot in the morning in the valley of the sun!
