darn it, wish I would have looked at this before sitting down to eat here. It took an hour for us to get our food served. Food was ok if you like a pound of curly fries served with everything. Mine was ok, ordered fish and chips but looked like the kind you buy at the frozen food section. But I was so hungry I ate them all.  Prices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality.  Also, had some crappy service from the nearby arcade people after buying some ride tickets for virtual nascar, had to get a refund after waiting an hour there. Thats why we chose the cafe cuz we were tired and hungry. Would definitely advise NOT to eat here or use the arcade services.

love this place! first ate here a few years ago before Yelp. Got to go last week and it was so good my mom wanted to eat there 2 days in a row! and my mom NEVER eats anywhere 2 days in a row.  highlights: giant portions, strong coffee, FAST SERVICE.  First day I ordered biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. Was a little weirded out by the orange potatoes but when mixed with the gravy they were very good. The biscuits are freshly made and are amazing! Coffee was really good and strong here too.  I was very curious for the Cincy chili and got a side of that but I had to taste it and take it to go. It was AWESOME. Brought it home and ate it on a hot dog! AWESOME.  the service here was VERY fast and it was great but definitely hard for everywhere else we ate in Vegas to live up to.  lets see my other families food choices were all GIANT and everyone was really happy which is very unusual for us.  Second day I ordered the spam, rice and eggs. I think they called it Hawaiian special. Of course it was great. My niece tried the apple cinnamon pancakes but they were seriously big enough for 4 people to split. I think she finished 1 whole pancake. VERY fluffy and good.

my 2nd time at a WH and I think they are great. Open 24 hours. We were in Phoenix visiting family and staying in a hotel with my parents and needed to get some alone time. Cheap, diner food, but always freshly made. I had waffles and they come with all kinds of topping options. I had plain and they are still very fresh and light. The loaded hash browns here are great too and you can choose from chili, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, ham, sausage, cheese, gravy or all of them. My hubby had all and it was really good. Really fast service and cheap prices.

ok so visiting Phoenix for the weekend and was about to go to another BBQ joint and decided to check it out on Yelp. Found nothing but bad reviews and one of those directed you to Stacy's. We went and it didn't disappoint. The only downfall is that they had run out of pork ribs (we went about 5 ish). So we sampled most everything else. Beef back ribs, falling off the bone. Honestly I've never liked beef ribs but these were so tender I felt like I was eating pork spare ribs. Serving sizes for meat were HUGE. Also ordered pork rib tips, pulled pork sandwich, hot links, and chicken. My family of 10 was very happy. Sides were also very good, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes dripping in butter with awesome homemade gravy, red beans and rice- spicy, potato salad(my mom said was the bomb and she usually only eats her own).  I also tried corn on the cob but didn't like how it turned out. Not sure if they forgot about it, but it was seriously overcooked. However, since the rest of the food was awesome I didn't ding them for it. So if you live in Phoenix area, or just passing through this tiny bbq joint is worth your while.
