I chose this hotel because I had to bring my dogs and everything about the hotel sucked but security when I had someone harass me and follow me to my room. Thank you Louie with room service for helping me with this scary situation. First and foremost I wasn't told while I'm gone my dogs need to be crated or they will be removed from the room to the pound. I found this out once checking in. So had to totally change plans so they weren't crated more then a few hours. They say the dog park is a private walk from room definitely not its through registration and valet so people everywhere. Also I was supposed to have their dog bowls in the room it took 6 calls and 2 hours. Also if u have a small dog like me (5lbs) they can escape because the fence doesn't go to the ground and it's spaced between each bar. Also forget about sleeping in the drapes don't close 100% these are the cracks between each blind from my bed and they were shut all the way. Way too many other better places definitely won't be back.

Absolutely can't say enough good things about this place and the owners. While visiting family and friends in town from California I brought my 2 little boys my babies to doggy suites and it was a great experience from start to finish. They were easy to be booked for the weekend the owner Shayna even gave me a FaceTime tour of the place so I could see which suite I wanted and then went with hollywoof. When we arrived the cinnemutt theatre opened up and since she knew I was overly sensitive about leaving them she upgraded them to a bigger room and they got lots of extra attention. She sent me pics throughout the day and Eve and I felt very at ease and could just relax while my babies were away. Pickup was also super easy and quick and the place itself is just darling with all the different theme rooms. This will be my dogs spot every time we visit AZ! Thank you doggy suites Shayna and staff
