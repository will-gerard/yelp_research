Once again, Yelpers. You rock! My hubby and I were out visiting and was looking for an easy sushi place. This came up on our radar and on a whim decided to go. At first look, this place is in a strip mall... hmmmm. Not exactly what I expected. Concrete floors. Worn tables and plastic chairs. But the bar -- nice and inviting. Ahhhh.  We pulled up a chair to the bar and settled in. Yelpers told us to say hi to Mo. So we asked. And lo and behold, Mo is the owner who was asking what we would like. We asked for his recommendation -- the yellowtail fish. And I was in the mood for a salad.  Kicked off with the seaweed salad. If a seaweed salad can knock your socks off, this one did. Just the right amount of dressing. Incredibly clean and cool tasting. I knew we were in for the night!   While we ate, we talked to Mo, who is actually from Toyama, Japan, and has had his own sushi bar for some time. He spoke broken English but that doesn't get in the w;ay of his great sense of humor and welcoming manner. And before I know it, we start talking to the person next to us who is none other than the concierge for The Boulders and this is one of his favorite places to eat! Talk about an endorsement.   Mo sliced the fresh fish right before us with unbelievable ease and skill. Yellowtail practically melted in my mouth. The tuna nigiri completed the night.   We absolutely love sushi but I have to say this is the freshest and most authentic Japanese food I have found. And being authentic is what Mo is all about. No fancy decor. Just the freshest, well-prepared sushi you will ever have. So don't go expecting some lavish dining experience. If you like California rolls. Stay home. Want ridiculous Americanized sauces? Skip this place. But if you know good sushi, you will never want to leave this place. Just writing about Toyama has me jonesing for it once again. I guess I'll have to wait until we're back in that neck of the woods. Wah!!!

Okay, picture yourself in a 1950s Italian restaurant. Terra cotta everywhere. Wooden chairs. Red checked linens. And even an authentic off-the-boat Italian owner, Alberto, who feels like a distant uncle who instantly greets you into his family.  Stepping into Alberto's Italian Restaurant feels like a step back in time. No gimmicks. No pre-fab menus. Just serious genuine Italian. Warm homemade bread. Pasta that Alberto made earlier that morning. Sauce that could make your legs turn to water it is so good.   There was a HUGE family party being held there the night we visited. Turns out it was someone's birthday and she said she couldn't have it anywhere else except Alberto's. Now that's saying something. There also was a small group - one of them was Italian (accent and all) and said that he was so happy to finally have true Italian food again. When we visited Italy several years ago, we thought, when are we going to have this wonderful food experience again? Thank you Alberto. You transported us back to the cobblestone streets of your youth.

While staying at The Boulders, the concierge recommended we try the Carefree Station, saying it was one of his favorite places. Then, as we were getting our car, another person working there said it was his "favorite place on the planet." A good sign!  The entrance is rather hidden and felt kind of spooky at night. You walk down this little narrow walkway. But then it suddenly opened up to a fairy tale. Dining al fresco. White Italian lights glittering against the night sky. Cheerful banter and the sound of clinking wine glasses. Is this heaven?  We managed to get an outside table -- shoot, I would have waited for one for as long as it took. Props to our server Ben who walked us through the menu and made sure we were taken care of that evening. There is the regular menu that made this place famous. However, there is a La Familia menu that started because there are a number of Mexicans that work in the kitchen. When they would cook for themselves and the staff, they would make the food they were taught as kids and the owner thought, why not offer it to patrons? So he created a dedicated Mexican menu that doesn't disappoint.   We are chatty people and before I knew it, the manger had pulled up a chair (it was toward the end of the evening) and was offering us tastes of other items on the La Familia menu. Good lord these were awesome! I am a Mexican food nut. And this is unbelievable Mex. We even go to chat with some of the cooks and had just the most magical night I can remember in a long time.   I know that people go to Carefree Station for their regular menu. But having had the La Familia treatment, I would never order anything but those specialties. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Wonderful experience eating outside on the upper outside terrace but the food was run of the mill Mexican at best. Skip this one.

We were staying at The Boulders and wanted a serious steak place. Could they recommend one? The concierge was so excited to send us here.   We walked in and what surprised me was how BIG this place is. There is a glassed in bar in the center of the steakhouse. And then there are booths for regular diners around it, creating a square of feasting. So the atmosphere is a weird mix of nice dining with a noisy bar in the middle and live musicians singing Billy Joel songs. All I could think was oh boy what have I gotten myself into? So even though we could hear the noise, even the regular diners were boisterous happy folk. So just in and go with the flow.   The service was excellent. We asked for a recommendation on the wine and the waitress didn't try to gouge us. We feasted on lobster bisque with chunks of lobster in it large enough to be a while claw.   Our waitress also recommended we try the filet-in-bone, which, to be honest, I had never heard of. But now I'm asking, why haven't I heard of this before!!! The filet-in-bone puts any other filer I've ever had to shame. The meat literally pulled apart it was so moist and it melted in my mouth. Not sure how I can go back to Chicago and eat steak the same way again. We also did the sweet potato mash was excellent. At the end of dinner, we literally couldn't eat anything more. And trust me, the offered desert but I think we may have exploded if we had given in.

The Golden Door Spa & Cafe isn't just a place to get a service, it is a destination within itself. We were staying at the Boulders but often made the Golden Door our home for the day.  The entrance sets the tone for the entire settlement. You walk through an amazing set up Chinese wooden doors to a calming entranceway. Once inside, you feel the peace and can look right through the sunlit lobby out to the pools and the boulders beyond.  We didn't take advantage of the "beauty" section (hair, nails, etc) while we were there but we did use the spa part! My husband had the Ashianti massage where a professional masseuse actually walks on your back. He said it was, under no certain terms, the. best. massage. he. has. ever. had. Hmmm. Think he liked it? When he walked out, he was smiling like he'd been dipped in butter. My massage was spot on (and it turns out the woman was from a massage place I go to in Chicago so she knew who I usually go to -- small world!)  After the massage, I went to the steam room. Ahhh. lovely steam room! I know they say you're only supposed to spend 15 minutes. Well, I happily broke the rules. (Shhh. Don't tell.) There was a hot tub, a warm relaxation pool and a heavenly rain shower. Oh, and did I mention that the spa is built to avoid rough corners, so everything has a circular feel to it. They also have a routine mapped out that you can do to help cleanse the system from steaming to cooling to steaming, etc. I lounged by the pool while hubby did it one day.... again, he loved it.  The pool area is adult only, cell phone free. Thank goodness! We were there to relax and remember that even though we are parents, we are people too. There is a water station in the pool area, cool towels, lovely views of the boulders, umbrellas for shade, hot tub, babbling brook, another terrific view of the spa building itself. Plus a terrific spa lunch menu. Can I have some more red pepper hummus please?  We felt like we were on a cloud. Oh, if we could have only stayed longer!!!! Do you think the grandparents babysitting back home would have minded?
