Best decision ever to finally try this place out! Great ambiance, attentive servers, stellar food and affordable right in the Tukee. What's not to love! Full screen tvs 360 degrees, comfy seating. I'm sold. My burger was like bitting into heaven. I could kiss the chef! I was a CKs girl but I've found a new place to digress at. You've got to try them out, like now..get up, grab your keys and go. Get the Truck Stop burger ;)

I love love love Wedge & Bottle. I have been coming here since they offered their groupon deal probably around 4-5yrs ago and haven't looked back. Customer service, pricing and offerings are the BEST in Ahwatukee.

Bad service. Side salad arrived with wilted lettuce. Burger arrived missing bacon. Server stopped coming by and never checked on us or refilled our drinks. Overall just not worth stopping by.

Yes, yes and another yes! This place was recommended by a friend. As I am from California I have pretty high standards on seafood. I will definitely be returning and plan to bring my California family members with me on their next visit to town. Why? Fresh oysters on the happy hour menu, gorgeous ambiance, friendly staff, fast service, affordable pricing and superb drinks. The only reason its not a five star review is because they were a little heavy with the ice in our drinks. Otherwise I couldn't be happier. Our server was Justice and he definitely did us JUSTICE. Super attentive, offered great suggestions and very friendly. Loved the oysters from Morro Bay, CA , crab cakes, blueberry mojito, high tide combo, deep fried avocado and beignets. Give this place a chance to woo you.
