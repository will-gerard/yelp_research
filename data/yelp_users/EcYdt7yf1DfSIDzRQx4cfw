Love this salon!  I went here my first time as a college student using a Groupon. Candace trimmed, glazed, and styled my hair. She is absolutely amazing. If you ever need a perfect blowout - she's the best around.  I highly recommend this place. The salon is located right under the W6 and the prices are affordable.

THE BEST ACAI BOWLS IN TEMPE! My favorite bowl is the original and the granola is amazing - you can't find it anywhere else! However, if you are in a hurry I don't recommend coming here because it usually takes more than 5 minutes to receive your order...sometimes even longer depending on how many people are there.

Definitely a 5 star fast-casual restaurant! This place is located right next to ASU campus and it's the perfect spot to meet with a friend over lunch! My favorites on the menu include the Jacked Up PB&J Smoothie and the Moroccan Turkey Sandwich with a side of Sweet Potato Hash!  Chopshop also has Open Mic nights every Wednesday, which I highly recommend!

I'm definitely a fan of Pita Pit! Great food and customer service! This place doesn't have a lot of seating, however I typically go here over lunch and bring it back to school or the office. The menu is pretty simple and you can choose any toppings to add to your pita - so delicious!

Worst catering experience ever. Not on time and didn't prepare what was ordered. Owner was rude and didn't respect our organization. The food is good, but I will never order from Dickey's in Tempe again.

This place is absolutely great! I dine at Postino's almost every week and try something different each visit. Everything is fresh and delicious. My favorites are the Turkey Panini on Ciabatta bread, Mixed Greens Salad, and the Cucumber Honey Lemonade!

Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Horrible experience working with the Graduate hotel for the company I work for. Bad sewer smell in the front lobby, rooms not ready for our conference room block, mean staff and no one on site to help...this list could go on.  The events manager - Miwa is the only one who is outstanding!
