I walked into See's for the first time since my childhood yesterday and was immediately greeted with a warm smile and shortly after another girl rushed over to me and handed me a sample chocolate with a smile. I told the lady I was looking for an anniversary gift and she showed and explained to me everything they had and helped me find the perfect gift and wrapped it so beautifully for me. I picked up some lollipops I remember loving so much when I was little and when ringing up at the register the lady who was helping me made sure I was happy with how she wrapped my gift and sent me off with more samples. such a wonderful experience and I'm so grateful for the wonderful lady's help making such a beautiful present. I can't wait to come back and pick up my favorite candies on a  regular basis from now on! thank you so much to all the wonderful ladies at See's!

I had such a wonderful time here! my friend and I ordered delicious savory crepes for lunch and shared a sweet crepe as a dessert! such a nice atmosphere too, they had a pianist and the server was running around singing in French.  I can't wait to come back and try more of their crepes!

this is one of my very favorite restaurants, the food is consistently great here. I always get the pretzel to start with the mustard seed aioli and then the salmon with the steamed vegetables and chipotle vinaigrette. every single time I go everything is cooked perfectly and I leave so happy. I've also had the pulled pork sandwich with fries, steak, mussels, fingerlings, and roasted chicken, and haven't had anything I dislike. I just wish they had a location closer to central phoenix so I could go even more often!

I come here over and over again for the sushi and love it! the poached salmon roll with eel sauce is amazing and the lightly battered California rolls are great! I've never had bad service here, maybe because I come during less busy hours but I've never had a complaint!
