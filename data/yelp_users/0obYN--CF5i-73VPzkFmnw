I shopped around before I took my watches in for batteries and repair.  I have an extensive watch collection and I wanted to ensure they would be taken care of.    First, I called and they were the nicest people on the phone.  Most other jewelers I called sounded as if they were rushed and didn't have time to answer my questions. They were patient and explained everything.  I had to call back a second time, I forgot to ask a question.  I arrived at the store and they were very attentive, listened to my request, as I had some repairs also.  They gave me an AWESOME bulk rate for the amount of watches I took in for batteries and repair.  They called one of the manufacturers for me, for a very unique watch/band combo and was able to get the information the next day.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HINRICHSEN for all of your jewelry/repair needs.  I will be visiting them again soon.  They have a great selection of jewelry in the store.  I looked around a little while I was there.    They are patient, listen, and follow through.  I am very satisfied with the repairs and battery replacement.  They are close to my home, saved me a trip to the mall.  This is my new neighborhood jeweler.

I've always liked Firebirds.  I love the atmosphere.  My bestfriend was visiting from Houston and we met her there.  The food and service was very good.  I didn't care for the lobster tail.  It had a strong fishy taste.  I always eat lobster tail from various places and it has never tasted like this.  Even when I have it fresh in California it doesn't have a fishy taste.  This is the first time I've ever gotten the lobster tail.  Other than that, I think it's a great place.  I will definitely go back, just won't order the lobster tail.

If I could give them no stars I would. Since they do provide internet service, I'll give them one star.  Notice I didn't say it was the best.    COX Communications has the worst customer service.  I've been with COX for 7 years,  never late. My account was on auto-pay but when my cc expired the charge didn't go thru.  Okay, I understand that.  I called on 2 December to get my account back on auto-pay.  I paid the outstanding balance and I specifically asked the customer service rep if I needed to pay the new balance.  He said 'no', the new auto pay will pick up the new charges'.  Well, that did not happen.  I had to call back again in 29 December because my account is again delinquent when it's supposed to be on auto-pay.  Now I'm told, that it takes one complete billing cycle for my auto-pay to kick in.  Well, that's not what I was told on 2 December.  I just want my account on auto-pay like it has been for the last 7 years.  How hard can this be?  They adjust off the late fees again, she explains I now owe two months - $155.98.  I'm okay with that. Then she tells me she is giving me a customer credit of $10 for my troubles on their part and that my bill will be $145.98.     Fast forward!  Log online and my account shows the $155.98.  Now I have to call back to get a different customer service rep.  She reviews the account, and instead of listening to me she starts from 2 December.  We're past that, I just want to know about the $10 additional credit that I was given and it's not showing.  She was dead set on reviewing this back from 2 December, so I got very aggravated with her for not listening.  I told her, not to worry about the $10, but just know that if/when Google Fiber comes to Phoenix I'll be the first to leave Cox!  People should learn to listen before they start to explain to you what you already know.  I only have internet with Cox and believe me, I will NEVER get any additional services with them.

First,I want to say, if I could give them NO Stars...I would!!!!!!   Cox is the absolute worse vendor I have ever done business with.  My 4 year old modem decided to die last month.  It was about 4 years old, so it was probably time.  I originally purchased that modem from Best Buy. I went back to Best Buy to purchase another modem this time.  COX is charging me $86 for a modem that I did not purchase from them.  Why would I rent a modem when clearly purchasing one from Best Buy or Amazon makes most sense.  Every month I have to call because they have screwed up something on my bill.  All I have is Internet with them and it comes with a lot of drama.  I put my bill on auto pay so that I don't have to deal with it.  Yet, I have to call every month for some erroneous charge.  I HOPE GOOGLE FIBER COMES FAST. I'M SO TIRED OF COX. I'LL BE ONE OF THE FIRST CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE COX.  I WILL NOT LOOK BACK OR REGRET IT.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO DO BUSINESS WITH COX, TAKE IT FROM A CURRENT CUSTOMER. .....RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND HOPE IT'S TO GOOGLE FIBER.

This is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the shrimp cocktail for the appetizer and filet mignon steak salad as an entree .  I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and I still love coming back.  The ambiance is great, service is great, food is good, and the deserts are to die for. Prices are $$ to $$$ but I  don't mind paying for good food and good service.  They get kind of busy in the regular eating times, i try to go a little later to avoid the rush.  Highly recommended!  You won't be disappointed.

First I want to say, I have only been attending classes for one week.  I am very happy with the facility overall and the Instructor provides great and detailed information.  You may ask questions at anytime or she is open to one-on-one discussions during breaks or after class.  After working all day, I don't get bored in class.  I have ten years as an Escrow Officer, so a lot of the information I am familiar with  and a lot of it I am not.  I do like the fact that they have 3 locations and the Thunderbird location is the closest for me.  Parking is hit or miss, because it is located in a busy shopping center.  Normally around our first break parking near the facility is available.     I recommend this school to anyone interested in getting their Real Estate License.

I normally groom my dogs myself, but my garage is too hot during the summer.  I decided to take them to Petco for grooming.   They did an awesome job.  I've never seen them groomed so well.  That says a lot because I used to have a mobile groomer for about 3 years.  I will definitely use PETCO for grooming and nail trimming during the summer months.  They are very reasonably priced and the customer service was outstanding.  Thank you Jessica!  I love the clippers they use.  I will purchase a pair of those specific ones in September when I start to groom them myself again.

This is the second time I have used First Impressions at two different residences.  They have great customer service and quality doors.  I was lucky enough to have my door installed on my birthday, they arrived on time as promised. The door was absolutely gorgeous.  My front door is red so I had to match it.  I ordered the Napa in Montero Red and it was the perfect match.  The door was installed three weeks earlier than expected.  The installer was very nice, had me view the door prior to installing to ensure it was what I ordered. He explained the maintenance and upkeep, safety of keeping the key near the door in the event of an emergency.  The entire experience was flawless.  Terry Hardin was my sales person for both transactions.  I highly recommend, if you need a quality security door, First Impression is the only way to go.

Total relaxation!  I've been coming to this location for almost a year.  I love the service.  I workout a lot so the  deep tissue massage is best for me.  Lisa is my massage therapist and she is AWESOME!  She knows all of my problem areas and does a great job of massaging out as much of kinks as possible.  Great customer service.  I highly recommend it.  Can't wait until my next appointment.

I've been to Danny's at this location (Northsight Road) many times with no issues.  I did have an issue at the Happy Valley location and will not visit that location again. Happy Valley location dinged my car and would not have the ding removed.  It was a pretty bit ding.  I paid $75 to have it removed. This time my issue is that my car sat for a little while before they started the hand wash, then sat another 20 minutes without anyone to detail it. When I asked to take my car, they started detailing it.  My car is black and have many water spots because they let it air dry without wiping off the water.  After being there a total of about 1 hour, I found out they lost my key.  It took them another 20 to 30 minutes to find my key.  I arrived at the car wash at 3:20 pm and didn't leave until 4:45pm.  The young boy detailing my car was moving at a snails pace, because clearly I had no where else I needed to be.   I WILL NOT GIVE DANNY'S MY BUSINESS ANY LONGER.  I WILL NOT VISIT ANY OF THE DANNY'S LOCATIONS, NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANY OF MY FAMILY, FRIENDS, OR CO-WORKERS.   Considering I work in the area with many associates for our company, I will spread the word not to visit this location.

On Tuesday, 3 July 2012, I took my car to Danny's for a car wash on Happy Valley and when I got it back it had a DENT in the driver's door. (HOLY HELL, BATMAN) They refused to take car of it....It was very noticeable, because it was the only DENT on my new car.   THEY HAVE LOST A LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER SINCE THEY FIRST OPENED THAT LOCATION.  I'm not going to even use the convenient store.  They take no responsibility for any damage that happens to your vehicle.  I'll wash my own car from this point forward.  USE DANNY'S AT YOUR OWN RISK!!  DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED.   Too bad they don't have TERRIBLE'S in AZ, like they do in Vegas.  I'll use the new Circle K store on Happy Valley and 19th Ave.

THEY DESERVE ZERO STARS!  Unfortunately, that's not an option.  I've never seen a business that provides such HORRIBLE customer service.  Danny's has the worst car wash service in the valley.  I would rather wash my own car or pay a mobile detailer, before giving them another penny.  After they dented my car and then wouldn't take care of it, I will NEVER visit another Danny's Family Car wash or convenient store.....Everyone if you really need a convenient store you should visit the Newer Circle K on Happy Valley and 19th Ave.

I don't drink coffee,  but I like the atmosphere at Elevate.  Nice place to go and just hang out, love the live music on Fri and Sat. Nights. There are plenty of tables outside to sit and hang out anytime of the day.

There are a lot of pool service companies out there, but not like these guys.  They are second to none.  They show up every week, and not only make sure the pool is clean they maintain the pool equipment as well.  They leave a little note to let you know what chemicals they put in the pool and that the pool was serviced. They are very prompt and professional, and very affordable.  We love Pink Dolphin Pool Care and will continue to use them. Keep up the great service.

29 March 2016 I posted before and after pics.  Mike and Brian are two AWESOME guys.  Mike called to make sure it was a good time. Brian was on time and the work was very professional.  He did not leave a mess on the garage floor.   I can't tell where I actually had the damage once he finished.  I hope I never need them again but if I do, I will definitely call them first.  GREAT JOB!  #freshwheelsrock  25 March 2016 This review is strictly on customer service, because I haven't had the work completed yet.  Mike is GREAT! He returned my call after hours, very nice, patient, and willing to come to me either st home or work to repair my wheel during the week.  I didn't feel rushed, he explained the process.  I felt very comfortable in booking with him to have the work done on Tuesday. Some other companies wanted me to bring in the tire and wheel. That's a problem since BMW vehicles do not have spares. Fresh Wheel can do the work without removing the tire.

First, I would like to say the customer service is excellent.    Many times I have gone into Yogi's just for a soda, last week was the first time I actually ordered food.  I'm a big fan of their teriyaki rice bowl.  The chicken is very tender and the sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some places.  I tried the spicy sauce and it is yummy.  The spicy sauce is perfect on the side, mixed with the regular sauce.  They have my favorite Coke machine.  I don't drink caffeine, my favorite soda is the ginger ale with vanilla.  After two visits, this is my new go to place for a teriyaki chicken bowl.  Looking forward to trying other selections from the menu.

I had some old 14kt and 10kt yellow gold items laying around. I took them to see how much I could get. I received a check for about $250, not a bad price.  It was so easy, they were very helpful, and honest. I will definitely use them again. No hassle and very honest!  I was in and out in about 15 to 20 minutes.    Call Valley Goldmine first!!!!

This review is only for the Minute Clinic,  not CVS store.  I'm not sure why they call this Minute Clinic?  This is my second time here and the wait has been more than 2 hours big times.  They have the ability to have 2 nurses on staff,  but only staff one nurse at a time.  This is rediculous.  If you can wait for your primary doctor, I recommend you wait.  Unless you have nothing better to do than sit and wait.

I have had Dish Network since 2000 and abosolutely love them.  I don't call customer service very often, maybe once a year if that.  When I do they are very nice and helpful, eager to assist with a happy solution.  Other companies are advertising features that I have had with Dish for a couple of years.  The service is great, the channel line up I love and Sling is a must have.  How did I ever live without Sling.    If you don't have a Hopper and Joey, it's a must have.  Primetime is awesome!  I love how it skips thru the commercials for you.  I hardly ever watch live tv anymore because of that.  I DVR everything.  It's nice to be able to record up to 6 shows and still be able to watch anything I want.   For me it's Dish or nothing!

I love threading versus waxing. I was happy to see a brow threading shop open in N. SCOTTSDALE. They are conveniently located off the 101 & Scottsdale Rd.  They did a great job, great shape, friendly staff, and very clean.  Diana Rodriguez is awesome! She did a great job on my brows.  Tomorrow is my second appointment with her.  Highly recommended.

Went to Jackson's to get lottery tickets and received the absolute worse customer service ever.  The cashier didn't have a name on her shirt so I can't put her on blast.  She was very rude,  no greeting,  just plain attitude.  I will never visit any Jackson's store or car wash ever again.  I'll be sure to share my experience with my friends.  I can spend my money at a business that appreciates it.  Next time I'll go to CIRCLE K down the street, at least they greet you there, without attitude.  #jacksonssuck. #donotgotojacksons #horriblecustomerservice   If I could give them ZERO STAR I would. ....

This place is amazing!  We had a few appetizers and they were all delicious. I'm a picky eater and never eaten frog legs before.  The frog legs are great, very tasty.   The service was great. The waiter was very attentive and made sure our drinks stayed filled. The decor is very welcoming with a little modern and Contemporary mixed.  I highly recommend BLK.  My Co workers and I will definitely be visiting again.  The CHEF came out to meet us.  That was awesome.  Can't wait try the pool.
