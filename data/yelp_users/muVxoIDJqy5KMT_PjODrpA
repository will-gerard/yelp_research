I hate to rain on the love parade for this place, but my husband and I went last night for pedicures.  I called earlier in the day and MADE APPOINTMENTS.  When we got there we waited 20 minutes to even get to the pedi chairs.  My husband waited another 10 minutes before a technician even started with him.  During the service she cut his toe!  The upside of his service was that she gave an amazing leg and foot massage.    Now back to my experience.....basically my service didn't begin until 25 minutes AFTER I got seated in the pedi chair (did I mention we had appt. for 5pm)!  45 minutes after our stated appointment time, I finally saw my technician.  Unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time, so I basically got shafted on the massage!  The staff was apologetic about the timing, but first impressions are a killer.  I really don't think we will be going back.  Sorry Biagio:(

My mom snowbirds here for 6 months, in the spring/summer she utilized Allstate Storage.  Well she just opened the unit yesterday, and everything was absolutely covered with dust and dirt.  Now, I know we live in the desert, but she has used other storage places and have never had the dirt like she had in this one!    As the movers came in this morning to transport her things, she went through the gate, then the moving truck went through.  The bar came down and broke over the moving truck.  The man in the office was a complete jerk and charged the moving company to repair the bar.  He stated there were signs that stated the bar will only allow for 1 car, even though he knew and saw the moving truck behind my mother's car.  As they all left, the guy was about to AGAIN drop the bar onto the truck, but then he reluctantly game out manually opened the gate.  This place needs some serious improvement!

WOW!  I had a Groupon that was  expiring, so my husband and I went last night.  I had heard great things about it, but great really doesn't even begin to describe the emotions that I went through last night!  Love the atmosphere, really love the cool chandeliers, benches, menus, all of it really.  I tried the Death's Door cocktail (I am a vodka drinker), loved it....and it was gin!  Then on to the tasting menu...I frankly adore tasting menus because of the small portions and you could to try the best of the best.  Amuse was a little green bean salad (wanted more), chilled corn soup (OMG, smooth, vibrant), carbonara (my idea of the perfect pasta dish...fresh pasta, fresh tomato sauce, basil, cheese)...I could eat this everyday!  Then the scallops came.....perfectly charred, delightfully sweet, done perfectly!  I don't think I have ever had a scallop done that well before!  Let the whimsy begin!  After the incredible courses we had already experienced, then came the cotton candy!  What a fun way to remember your childhood,  oh did I mention the doughnuts!  Not only where they piping hot, but came with 3 delish dipping sauces!  What else can I say...we love love loved it!  The food was spot on as well as the service!  This is a definite repeat performance!  Thanks Noca!!!!!

I had my annual Holiday party last night and had purchased the Doozy of a Deal for 5 hours of help from Moxie Girl.  BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!  Amanda arrived promptly at 7pm and took over for me!  She was amazing, keeping the appetizer buffet full and my guests very pleased!  She is so personable, and the majority of my guests complimented her on her constant professionalism.  By the time she left at midnight, every dish had been cleaned and garbage thrown away.  I woke up this morning to a clean house with only serving pieces to put away!  I can't tell you how great it was to know that Amanda had everything under control!  Thank you thank you Moxie Girl...you made our party really wonderful! Heather

I know I am SOOOO late with this review, but I guess better really really late then never! My husband and I host an annual holiday party every year and we have been fortunate enough to have Moxie Girl help us for the last 4 years! I usually request the lovely Amanda (my hubs is from SD as well), she wasn't available this year, so we were lucky enough to have Erin help us this year! I had a couple requests from Amanda if I couldn't have her at my party, 1) my Moxie Girl had to be a clone of Amanda and 2) she had to come to my home a few days before and see the "lay of the land". On Friday, the day before the party, in walked Erin! Ummm, hello Amanda look-alike! She came ready to learn, with a note pad and pen. What???? I asked Erin what Erin had prepped her about my party, and she said "No burlap, and don't let Heather get the pizza out of the oven". Well played Amanda!!!!! The day of the party, Erin arrived and was AMAZING! She exceeded all of our expectations! Erin was professional, friendly, courteous, and did I mention AMAZING!!!! All of my guests loved her, and a few struck up conversations with her as well! Thank you so much for making my holiday party a success!!!!!! Heather and Mike Doyle

We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.    All in all, a really nice meal!

I bought the Groupon for KoKo for an unlimited month of "smart training" at KoKo.  I have a gym membership somewhere else, but like a lot of us....never went.  I called and set up my initial appointment and haven't stopped since!  The strength machine is completely computerized and you put your individualized USB drive into the machine and you get a personalized workout.  It tracks your pace and you get points for each workout.  If you are like me, I love to see how many points I get each time, based on my pace and I am still striving for "Club Perfecto" , as well as my orange lanyard!  KoKo is very non-intimidating, there are no mirrors on the walls or the ceilings, and you won't see guys staring at themselves in the mirror fixing their hair and kissing their muscles!    I think one of the nicest things about the club is from the day I walked in as a "newbie", I was always greeted by my name!  So different the any other experience I have ever had!  After my Groupon intro month was over, I immediately joined!    The staff is great, they are so welcoming and really know their stuff!  Thanks KoKo, for once in my life, you have made me look forward to finally integrating exercise into my life every day!

I have to agree with every word that Michelle G. said...AMAZING only scratches the surface!  My friend and I usually go to another sushi restaurant, but it was closed on Sunday, so I pulled out Phoenix Magazine Best New Restaurants and thankfully we found ShinBay!  The restaurant is tucked away in the Scottsdale Seville, and the atmosphere is very clean lines, modern, fantastic!  Our server Meredith, and another server (I'm so sorry I forgot your name) helped us navigate the small menu...when I small, it is not to offend.  I believe a menu should reflect one cuisine and every single item should be able to done to perfection.  In this case, this small menu does not disappoint!  Meredith suggested a wonderful wine, a crisp, fruity Sauv Blanc to go along with our ShinBay tasting menu.    1.  We started with a trio of cold items....Tuna tar tare with pine nuts and avocado (melt in your mouth, the pine nuts added a different spin on the typical tar tare), Halibut sashimi in miso, and a charred Scallop on heirloom tomato with truffle oil, truffle salt, and thinly sliced truffles.  I am normally not a truffle lover, but this knocked my socks off!  Each item was seasoned to perfection and delicious!  2.  The hot course was Wagyu  beef served with a Japanese ceramic grill.  It was accompanied by oyster mushrooms, Himalayan sea salt and ShinBay's variation on steak sauce.  This was an interactive course.  The grill is presented sizzling hot, you add a bit of the beef fat to the grill to season it, then you start grillin'!  Cindy and I had a great time preparing everything, and I am sure the expressions on our face were priceless to the staff!  3.  The third course was a compilation of fresh nigiri.  You will have to forgive me, I can't remember their exact names...each piece was meant to escalate from lightest tasting to the fattiest.  Again, I don't intend to offend by stating "fattiest".  In this case this was Toro, which literally melted in my mouth!  We actually started with the Toro and went backwards.  Next was shrimp, a "sardine" like fish but less oily, tuna, and then something similar to yellowtail.  Each piece was seasoned again to perfection to enhance the fish.  There was just enough ginger to cleanse your palate after each piece!  No need for wasabi and soy sauce AT ALL!!  4.  The final course was a Japanese custard with black sugar cane syrup and fresh fruit.  I love Creme Brulee and this was light and delicious, the perfect ending!  On a Sunday night, we were the only patrons, so we chatted with everyone there.  They were all so kind and we had a fantastic time!  You have to forgive me for not remembering everyone's names, but your wine selections were spot on!!  Thanks for an amazing Sushi experience!!
