I absolutely love this place. Just to give you a basis for comparison: I've eaten at most of the upper-end Chinese places throughout Central-to-North Phoenix, and this one is up there. The food is excellent; it used to be just pretty good, but I've noticed it getting better and better as of late. The hot-n-sour soup is ridiculously good, and if you like sweet Chinese, the Schezuan chicken is delicious. Portion-size is great for the price as well; I can usually feed my family of 4 for $40 or less, with enough left over to have for lunch the next day.

Great food if you like spicy stuff! EVERYTHING is spicy, even sweet-n-sour stuff. I highly recommend the chai tea. Very sweet, but absolutely delicious.

Good: fried shrimp Meh: orange chicken Bad: szechuan beef, garlic shrimp, ribs, crab puffs Ugly: hot and sour soup  Wow, I was HUGELY disappointed in this place. I've never had hot-and-sour soup that I considered even average, I'm THAT big of a fan of the soup...this was absolutely inedible. I had two sips and gave up. The crab puffs were full of cream cheese and no crab at all. The orange chicken had a good sauce, but the chicken was pretty apparently frozen chicken nuggets. I could go on but, really, why? Just not what I expected with the Yelp reviews.

Like many other reviewers, we had a spring break on our garage door and called Lodi based on a recommendation of a friend. I was very happy with the service; not only did they replace the springs, but they also tuned up the rollers and such so it opens and closes silently, a big improvement over before. Final price was actually one cent lower than the estimate. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star rating is that the first technician wouldn't move my workbench out of the way so he could have access to one side of the garage; no big deal, I moved the bench and he came back out the next day.

This place is amazing. I've been there twice now and had the red chile taco. Holy crap that's good! My sole problem with the place is the lack of free drink refills. Especially with the spicy food, come on guys, you gotta get on the bandwagon!

These guys rock. I needed to get a new fan motor for my heatpump and they checked around and got me a good price on one. When I showed up to pay for it, one of them actually drove to the place they were ordering it from and picked it up for me so I could have it that day. They were also offering to give me a free capacitor for it, but it wasn't necessary.  Only negatives: I waited a full week after telling them to go ahead and order it because they never mentioned that I'd have to pay up-front. Simple miscommunication.  NOTE: their hours on Yelp are not currently accurate; they close at 4:30pm.

Love this place. I don't normally give 5 star reviews...in fact, I think this is my first...but these guys treat you right and provide great service.  Good case in point: I neglected my timing belt (120K miles isn't a smart move...) and it actually snapped. On my car (a Honda CRV), when the timing belt breaks, there's almost a 100% chance of valve damage, so I expected the worst and was prepared to pay the worst, and even told them when it was towed in, "I'm sure my valves are blown, so, I know I'll be paying through the nose, but, whatever it takes." Instead, when they pulled it apart, they found zero damage, and were able to put it back together and get me out the door within a few hours. A dishonest shop, or even MOST shops, would have gone ahead and charged me for a valve job, but instead, this shop voluntarily saved me hundreds of dollars (I think close to a grand). It takes a special kind of shop to willingly take such a hit, money-wise.   Great shop, all-around.

We went into the Codfather after hearing all the positive vibe and came away...satisfied.  The atmosphere was perfect for us. I love the look and feel of a good English pub, and while the location is a little worse for wear, it was just fine.  We had the fried mushrooms and zucchini as appetizers and I gotta say: really damn good. The garlic breading on those were amazing.  For meals we had the cod and the crab legs. The cod was admittedly just okay; if they used the same garlic breading, it would probably be amazing, but their normal beer batter was rather flavorless. The crab legs were fantastic, though.  The service was quite good, which definitely helped raise my score from 3 stars to 4. In all, we'll be back, but next time, we'll look at some shepherd's pie!

After being a life-long chain eyecare customer (Nationwide, Lenscrafters, Eyemasters, etc), I finally decided to go with North Phoenix Eye Care because I now have vision-specific insurance, and these folks take it.  Right off the bat, everything went well: appointment was made, then, on Friday, I got a call that they had an opening the next day that I could take if I wanted. Awesome!  Show up for my appointment and my Dr, Chelsea Crandell, is just plain awesome. That perfect blend of professionalism and personality to make me feel both at-ease (which I need when somebody's holding a metal device 1" from my eyeball) and comfortable that she knows what she's doing. Every step of the way she kept me informed on what she was doing and seeing and very informative on what my options are.  I really can't recommend these folks enough. And I'm never stepping foot in a chain store again.

I have to admit to being very surprised by this place. We went in as an afterthought and are very glad we did. We ordered the Cuban Pork sandwich (holy crap that's good, easily on par with those at fancier places), the grilled cheese (not as good, but still tasty), clam chowder (very good), red pepper & lobster soup (amazing, but unless you love the richness of lobster, you won't be able to finish it), and some fruit (not bad, but not much variety). The food was quick and very affordable. Highly recommend!

I love this place! Their sauces are ridiculously good, the seafood seems extremely fresh. I only have two things I would say: 1) their canolis aren't as good as other Italian restaurants; the filling almost seems chalky 2) their kids' menu has a good selection, but the red/marinara sauce they use for the kids' dishes seems considerably lower quality than that used in other dishes. Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this place.

I have to say, I was really disappointed in this. I've done one other room escape here in town and thought it was pretty good, so I wanted to give this a try.   First, the good: the staff was helpful. That's really about it.  Now, the bad: 1) The location is completely hidden, and completely exacerbated by having different addresses on the tickets, the confirmation email, and on their website. In the parking lot, there's no signage or anything. 2) When we got into the room, I was SHOCKED at how small it was. We only had 7 people and it was next to impossible to move inside this room...and they take up to 12 people at a time. This also makes it really stupid when you're trying to dodge the "zombie". 3) This is very minor, but, we were told when we went in that the "zombie" would get you out if he touched your foot with his hand; so, my strategy was to just stay away from his hands. I was quite surprised to find out that he could touch me with his feet and get me "out" as well. 4) I had understood that the zombie would get an extra foot of chain per 5 minutes...well, after the first 15 minutes, the zombie had full range of the room...we were only surviving, simply put, because the zombie was being nice and having fun with us. 5) Their clues/riddles/puzzles are really, really bad. Like, god-awful bad. There needs to be at least SOME logic to the puzzle, but there was none of that here. I wish I could go into detail, but that would obviously ruin things, but, I'll make up an example: if you're trying to escape a room, it doesn't make any sense at all to do things like require you to count the number of ceiling tiles and electrical outlets in the room...but there was something very similar to that we encountered. There should be a logic and a flow to things, as the other room escapes do. 6) This was particularly bad. As we were completing tasks, one of the guys running the game was continually re-setting puzzles for the next game. This lead to members of our team stumbling upon a key or other new clue and trying it, only for the guys running it to say, "You already used that key." Gee, thanks! We just spent several minutes trying to use it.... 7) Two of the puzzles were essentially broken.  It was pretty rough there. If these guys seriously want to run a good show, they should eliminate the zombie (or use a bigger room...and follow their rules on the chain), and they need to revamp their clues in a big way.
