Most delicious Thai I've ever had. Be prepared to wait but it's well worth the wait.   Just like everybody else, I discovered this restaurant after watching diners drive-ins and dives on the food network so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.   We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Contrary to other reviews the waitstaff was quite friendly and had no problems taking our order quickly. We ordered a bunch of different things to try it all out.   I LOOOOVED the Tom Ka (best I've ever had and I am/was loyal to Thai Rama)!!! For appetizer we had the Dragon Eggs- we preferred them steamed but tried both. We also enjoyed the yellow curry, spicy and delicious, as well as the Pad Thai with shrimp. All were amazing. I had the Milk Boba to drink and that was coconutty, sweet, and yummy!   A little more pricy than we usually pay for Thai but the flavor profiles were bomb. We will be back. Soon we hope.

I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again.

Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure.

I really wish the mic didn't have a mute button because the guy taking our order was cussing at customers in the drive through... If you don't like your job, find another one. Awful customer service and crappy ice cream. Oh and a tip for the employees based on my experience and all the bad reviews I've read (obviously isn't a problem just tonight) try smiling once and a while or treat people with respect.

Update: I only wish they took American Express! They'd have a lot more business if they did.   It has been very hard to find a decent nail salon since I've moved from San Diego to Phoenix but FINALLY I've found a great place! Both Don and Theresa have done my nails and they've turned out beautifully every time. Best of all, it's affordable. I highly recommend them to all. :)

After moving away and not visiting the salon for over 4 months I didn't feel welcome back to the salon whatsoever. I also think it's strange after going here for over two years that none of the staff ever attempted to ask or call my by name. Very impersonal. Teresa did my nails this time and she was in a rush the whole time and it showed. I asked for a glittery light pink/white almost natural looking tips with a little sparkle and I got bright pink... She never asked if I liked it or was happy. She was very rough filing my nails and I told her from the get-go that I need them short for work. They were long and I had to ask her to please file them shorter to which she said sure and rolled her eyes. After that I didn't dare voicing my opinion again. She told me to go wash my hands and then she was gone working with someone else in the back. Not so much as a goodbye or thank you. Rude. I got home from the salon and spent 15 minutes filing my nails to the shape and length I asked for. $33 for a lack luster service with mediocre quality work. I'm tired of being treated like a dollar sign... never going back.

Amazing! Our first time here was wonderful. Delicious food and wine with cool live music. Beware that it gets pricey if you're paying for wine by the glass because you want to try them out. We left with an $80 tab, easy.

Normally we love this place and we come here often because of the location, friendly staff, and food quality. Tonight must have been a bad night for the cook because he was grumpy and rude. I don't know if we will be returning to this location. It's a shame to lose business because of the poor attitude of one partner.

After speaking with the manager, Geoff, I had to update my review. Geoff was extremely kind and understanding regarding my previous visit to YC's. I haven't been back in to try things again but I'm confident our experience will be a positive one. Thank you to Geoff for your professional and friendly demeanor, it was a pleasure working with you.

We came here to participate in the karaoke contest... One problem is that the band plays 3-5 songs in between contestants' songs. It's been OVER 3 HOURS and we're still waiting to sing the competition song. So we wait and wait and wait while the band plays and plays then they announce that they're taking ANOTHER break and then they'll announce the winner. We hadn't performed and neither did two other contestants! Really? The lead singer of the band would rather hear himself sing mediocre runs that let other people have a go or keep track of the people's names clearly written down on the list and waiting to sing! If we came here to just listen to music it'd be another story. We got so fed up and tired of waiting that we left early! What a giant waste of time... Then to top it off, our waitress gave us one giant check for our whole party when we specifically asked for separate checks. We were so annoyed by the whole situation we just threw down money and left. Freaking ridiculous.

Horrible experience and most awful customer service ever. I waited and waited and waited when I got there... I understand if it is busy but the least they could do is acknowledge the people waiting. The first car they gave me smelled like mold and cigarette smoke. It was so bad that I had to come all the way back (wait some more) and exchange the car out. They said I could get an upgrade for the inconvenience but of course nothing was available. To top it all off the temporary authorization they put on my car that they said was released went through... Now they won't even pick up the phone when I call. Awesome time. Oh wait... Just kidding.

Mediocre at best. The grumpy man who failed to greet me when I came in ended up being the one to cut my hair. He didn't say much other than the usual, "what shampoo and conditioner do you use?"  I have long hair and I asked for a trim and to define the layers. He spent 10 minutes cutting my hair and didn't verify if everything was the same length like most stylists do. He spent most of his time spraying me in the eye with his water bottle. Let's say, I won't be back.

I would give them a negative rating if I could. We were overcharged for The Works wash and when we brought it to the attention of the clerk she gave us a huge run around. I've never experienced worse customer service. Finally after radioing her manager she agreed to charge us as it is advertised. Then to top it off when we asked to take advantage of the student discount ($3 off) she said it was too late because she apparently can't refund our transaction and recharge us. Which is bull. Now for the condition of our car and the outside employees... Everyone stands around in a group talking and smoking like social hour. When our vehicle say there unattended to for over 5 minutes. A couple of employees came around to our car and used the same dirty rag to wipe down the interior, exterior, and the windows just spreading around the grime. It was especially amusing when one employee yelled to the other "stop f****ig around" cuz they were all just joking around and laughing. Our car is covered in water spots, the interior is dusty, they did one swipe along the inside of the trunk and that's it. Missed an entire wheel. It was so crappy we couldn't stand it anymore so we left. We talked to a manager who REFUSED to give us our money back. Poor, awful, abysmal service. Never ever again.   Huge rip off!

Well I'm sold. I've been to this location two or three times now. Each and every time I've gotten the most amazing service. The baristas are so friendly and always quick to recommend something new. I've been a Starbucks fan (addict) for years now but I may be changing my following. Today I tried my first Italian soda... Orange with cream. Delish. :)

I had a pretty lack luster experience my first (and only) time I visited this spa. The interior is quite nice and clean.  My massage therapist was Jen and I asked for a relaxation massage with medium pressure but a little bit more in my shoulders because that's where I have pain. First of all, she did not knock on the door after asking me to get undressed which caught me by surprise. She was very rough near my spine and never asked how I thought the pressure was. I'd say she used deep pressure in my back and light pressure everywhere else... Not what I asked for at all. I felt no relaxation from my usual favorite part the calves, feet, and hands... Which was disappointing. I felt uncomfortable with some of her draping techniques. I've had a lot of massages and I have friends who are therapists so I was not impressed the way she moved my underwear around- lifting it up to tuck the sheet with her hands etc. I was also very uncomfortable when she asked me to flip over. She did not cover me at all with the sheet and was looking down at me- not discrete or professional at all. I had to cover myself while flipping over because I didn't want to be exposed. Also, the massage ended early. I didn't get my full time.  After the mediocre massage I went out to the front desk. The receptionists were nice and friendly but of course they tried to get me to sign up... but after my experience I was not interested. Then they tried to charge me more money. Apparently my therapist told them I requested deep tissue which was not the case at all. So they tried to charge me $10 extra which is ridiculous. Needless to say I'm glad I had a gift card. I won't be signing up and I won't be back.

So unhappy with my most recent experience at this store. We went out of our way to come in because I had a coupon or $1 off any sub and we like their pepper relish. We ordered our sandwich after waiting to be greeted and asked for pepper relish which they did not have. No sorry no nothing. Ok... Then I get to the register and I asked to plug in my points because we're getting a giant sub and didn't want to miss out on rewards, we're told that's not working. Ok that sucks. That's a big reason we go here, loyalty points... Then I asked to use my coupon and the staff member tells me no. After all of the other stuff that went wrong... No again? It was $1. He said it only worked on regular subs. I bought a giant... Which costs more than a reg sub, so the company is still making money. Wtf? The staff was unapologetic and absolutely the worst experience. You've lost my family's business Jersey. How disappointing.

Worst experience I've ever had at a Post Office. The man was rude and short with me. When he offered me my shipping choices he was condescending and said "you're not listening to me". I said cheapest is great. He repeated "you're not listening to me" like I'm a child. So rude and ridiculous. This is why I deal with the automated system. Seriously what a jerk.

My boyfriend I tried out this place last night because our usual Pho place was closed... First of all, it took 10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter and to get drinks. My boyfriend asked for a Dr. Pepper and the waiter told him that it was unavailable. Ok- so we both had a green tea. We ordered the crispy spring rolls with pork and were told that they were out of pork. Ok- so we ordered the chicken... Our appetizer came out but it wasn't what we ordered... We were served the fresh spring rolls. Which were ok tasting but not what we ordered. We each had Pho... Probably the most boring least flavorful Pho I've ever had. Once I added the chili and Hoisin sauce it was decent but nothing more than average. Let's talk about the smell in the restaurant now... Someone used the restroom at one point in time and decided to leave the door open. We were seated right next to the restroom so let's just say that the smell was pretty awful while we tried to eat our food. I asked for a to go container for the remainder of my Pho and it was put into a plastic container where the lid wasn't shut and it leaked all over... We weren't offered a bag for transportation of course so that was a disaster. On a positive note, we liked the atmosphere... It was very hipster. But unfortunately that doesn't outweigh all the negatives so...  All and all we won't be back.

Awesome sandwiches. Poor staffing. I'd love to give this place a better rating if the staff were more friendly and paid better attention to their customers rather than gossiping with each other or on their phones behind the counter. A little hustle for the poor people waiting in the drive through for over 5 minutes for a sandwich would be nice too.

Delicious boba drinks and the owner was so sweet, she gave us 10% off for checking in. The shop is nice and clean. I got the blueberry milk tea with boba and my boyfriend got the Thai tea with boba. Delish. We'll definitely be back. :)

Amazing work and the people are so friendly and accommodating. It was my first time here and I will be back. Everyone kept asking how I was and how I liked everything. I appreciated them ensuring that everything was as I like it. You also really can't beat $25 for a pedicure and little to no wait time. I can't wait to try acrylics here next time!

First and last time at this nail salon today. I called ahead of time and told them that I wanted a fill with French tips. I was quoted $20 but plus $10 for gel on top. Expensive for a fill but I thought I'd try it. The lady who filed down my nails made several complaints about how "thick" they were. Sorry, no I didn't like the last place, that's why I'm here trying somewhere new. She was very rough and cut my twice. My nails were perfectly short as I requested which was nice. Although I asked for sightly flared and didn't get any flare. I guess she forgot... Another girl painted my nails and I pointed out the big chip in my pinky and she said it was just my nail. Ugh rude. I knew I wasn't going to get anywhere and everyone was staring at me so I let it go. Nails were painted ok. Pretty messy on the sides and underneath- so I fixed that when I got home as well as filed several nails that were crooked. The best part of this experience was when I went to pay and was told it was $35. I questioned it because I was told $30 with gel but she insisted. Who knows why they up charged me. But $35 for a mediocre fill is ridiculous. I will not be back.

What can I say? Awesome experience with great atmosphere, attentive staff, and delicious food.  We were promptly seated tonight and greeted right away. Our waitress was super sweet and well versed on the menu and made excellent suggestions. We even had the pleasure to meet the manager who was pleasant and courteous. He exceeded our expectations and personally checked on us to make sure everything was great which was much appreciated. You don't get service like this anywhere else!  The restaurant has an amazing ambiance with stone walls, comfy booths, and just an overall cool vibe. Everything was clean and immaculate from the tables to the restrooms. Did I mention how delicious the food is? Wings (vings) were spicy and yummy, entrees were hot and fast, and OMG dessert was to die for... Best I've had! Thank you to The Vig McCormick Ranch for a great experience!!!
