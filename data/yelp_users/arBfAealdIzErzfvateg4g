I was in a bind and out of town when the "boys" here really helped me out.  I called and spoke with Ted, who gave me a quote for the work I needed done.  He greeted me when I arrived and quickly got to work on starting my order.  I was happy to find that everyone here was very direct and up front, and I walked out paying the same as the quote and no one tried to up-sell me (or talk down to me).  Willy worked on my car quickly and efficiently, and Gene helped me look for parts.  I really appreciated how easy the whole trip was and that I was taken care of as soon as I pulled up.  I would definitely recommend this place for parts or service if you happen to live in the Scottsdale area.

I just went here for the first time tonight with my family and had a great time.  The food was delicious, but what really sold it for me was our outstanding service.  We were helped by Maria and she was a total sweetheart!  She knew the menu very well, gave great recommendations, and made sure we had everything we needed.  As for the food, I had a gluten-free pizza and their crust was really yummy (which can sometimes be a challenge when doing things gluten-free)!  My family had a pizza, calzone, salad, and dessert, and they were all very satisfied with their selections.    I do wish they were able to serve alcohol, but that did not ruin the dinner whatsoever.  Plenty of parking out front and this location is right down the street from Tempe Marketplace.  Highly recommended!

Just went to Hanny's for the first time and really loved it!  It reminded me of one of the speak-easy style restaurant/bars in LA, with a great menu and drink selection to boot.  If I lived in AZ, this would surely be a hang out.  I had a beet salad, veggie pizza, and a Pim's cup, and really enjoyed the food (as did my family, who also had pizzas and dessert).  This place is great if you have stuff to do downtown (either before or after a show/event), and the swanky/sexy atmosphere would be great for a date as well.  I loved that they kept the vibe of the former store alive, but added their own flare, including the bathrooms & downstairs (it is a must to see both).  Our server Nicole did an awesome job!  She was really nice and on top of it, and made the evening even more special.  The bar was packed and for good reason - the bartenders really know how to make a drink!  (They are all pretty easy on the eyes, too...).  A DJ was spinning from his perch above the crowd, adding to the overall cool ambiance.  I recommend parking in a lot nearby as it can be a bit hard to find a spot on a busy night.  But, there's a lot to walk to nearby, so you get a lot of bang for your buck.  A huge plus - the kitchen is open until 1am 7 days a week!  Phoenix needs more places like Hanny's!  A must-try for great food, drinks, & service in a really cool environment!

If you had asked me a month ago, I would have given this place 5 stars.  Sadly, after my second visit, I feel the need to write this review.  The food and beer selection at O.H.S.O. is pretty great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star.  In fact, my first time here was pretty good.  I thought this would be a go-to when I come to town, but then I had dinner there this past week, and well, I'm never going back.  Now, I admit, I'm a picky eater and I like to modify my dinner.  I live in LA, where almost every single person I know modifies in some form or fashion, and it's rare for that to be an issue.  You would think a restaurant in a city as big as Phoenix would see a lot of that, too.  However...  When it came time for me to order my meal, I started to explain that I would prefer my pizza with no cheese, and a few other items off of it.  The last time I had been there, this was not a problem at all, and that server was happy to help me.  THIS time, I unfortunately was served by Brooke, who not only didn't help me, but she served up a healthy portion of her less-than-helpful attitude.  Upon ordering, she told me "You could do that - but it's not gonna taste very good" (in a pretty b****-y tone, mind you).  That's funny - I don't remember asking her opinion of what I wanted to eat!  I've actually worked in the service industry before, and there is a way to let a customer know that a certain dish might not be as palatable that doesn't include a rude and condescending tone.  Little did she know that I had eaten the same exact dish a month prior and enjoyed it thoroughly.  In a town that has a lot of restaurants, I hope this is a lesson to treat customers like you prefer they come back again, and appreciate their business while they are there.

I'm a huge fan of the Drybar "chain" and love the Sunset location.  I was happy to see that they have set up shop in both Scottsdale and Phoenix, and have been to both locations recently.  What I really like about Drybar is that you can pretty much guarantee that the staff has been well trained in the Drybar way, and for the most part, you get a pretty great blow out no matter which location you choose.  Today I was seen by Sarah (at the Phoenix spot) who did an awesome job!  She knew exactly what I was asking for, and not only did she do a great job, but she was quick and careful.  I liked her attitude, as she was friendly and happy to be there.  The girl who checked me in was very pleasant as well and I did not have to wait past my appointment time to be seen.  As usual, the decor is beautiful and I really love that there is a window in the back where you get your hair washed.  It really opens the space.  Another plus - parking is a breeze since it's in a huge shopping area.  If you live in Phoenix and love blow outs, you have to try this Drybar!
