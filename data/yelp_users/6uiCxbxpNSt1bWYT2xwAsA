I've being going to Serrano's for years and I've never had a problem with their food. They serve all of the traditional Mexican dishes that you would find at any Mexican restaurant. I've tried a lot of their menu items but I'd have to say my favorite go to plate is the shredded beef or "machaca" chimichanga. It is especially good when you get it enchilada style which is smothered in red sauce. It comes with a helpful serving of rice and beans too.  What I really like about Serrano's is that they are one of the few Mexican restaurants in the valley that still serves free chips with not only salsa but bean dip as well.

This place is amazing. Great selection and also a lot of rare finds. They are doing something right because it seems like they've been open forever. Hollywood Video is gone and Blockblusters have been shutting down left and right and these guys continue to prosper.        Its one of the few places you can still rent a video game console by the hour and they sell and rent adult films if you're in to that.       I'm really glad to have an independent video rental place really close to home :]

This store seems to always be busy, but they still managed to have great customer service. I recently bought a MacBook Pro from this store and one of their associates spent a solid hour with me talking me through the basics of the OS because I am a first time Apple customer. I wish they carried more colors for the hard laptop covers. All they had was pink and turquoise. Other than that is was a great experience. I'm happy to be part of the Apple family.

I came here for the NHRA Finals on Sunday 10/16/11 and I had a great time. The last time I was out here was about 10 years ago for some Top Fuel Hydro races and honestly, not a lot has changed (except for pricing lol).  Also I think every ticket is eligible for pit area access now. Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).  My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October.  Be sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away.

So this is the first time I've been here in what seems like 15 years and from what I remember a lot has changed. They have expanded tremendously. I went there for their Pumpkin and Chili Festival. The food was good and so were the attractions. It is very kid-oriented and it was just good clean fun (except the dust) but c'mon.... its a farm :) I just wish it wasn't so darn hot outside in mid October. Just bring some shades, sunscreen and a hat and you'll be set for a fun experience.

I have bought 4 guitars here in the past 6 years and 1 acoustic bass. They all sound excellent aside from the Ibanez acoustic dreadnought. There were a lot of muted notes up higher on the fretboard. I can't complain too much because it was originally a $400 guitar that was price at $100 for their Labor Day special that they throw every year. That's where I got my Fender acoustic for $200, which was originally $800. Plus they have an extensive line of strings and parts if you are in need of repairing something. Personally I have never checked out anything other than their guitar section, but they also have other rooms with drum equipment and tons of stuff for DJ's and music production.

This Wal-Mart was converted into a SuperCenter a few years back but I gotta say they still don't carry a lot of items that other "true" SuperCenters offer. And I mean A LOT. I have found myself on several occasions having to drive to another Wal-Mart just to pick up certain things that this store should but does not carry. And to top it all off I don't think I've ever witnessed more than 5 or 6 cashiers on duty at any given moment. They always seem to be understaffed so if you decide to stop by be ready for at least a 5 to 10 minute wait in line depending on what time you go. (P.S. This one doesn't have self checkout lines.)

This Great Clips has been here ever since I was born, which was '86. It is the only place I have gotten my haircut ever and I have never had a problem with them messing it up.

Never had a problem with this Starbucks. They are as friendly as can be and the drinks are made perfect every time. Keep up the awesome customer service!

I used to go to B Dubs a lot but their customer service has consistently diminished over time. I placed a carry out order and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. So  I show up 25 minutes later only to find out that my order was still not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. So I payed for my order and proceeded to wait out the 10 extra minutes they estimated. Fast forward another 20 minutes and my food had still not been given to me. Then the girl up front asked me if I had been helped yet. Keep in mind she's the same one that helped me when I first arrived. I couldn't understand how after only 20 minutes she had forgotten that she previously helped me.  I informed her that I was still waiting for my carry out order that she quoted to be only a 10 minute wait (on top of the other 20 minutes) In the end my small $30 carry out order took roughly 55 minutes to be completed when I was initially told 20 minutes. And to top it all off my boneless wings were barely coated with sauce. I will definitely have to be craving wings for me to return and honestly I'll probably fix that craving by getting wings from somewhere else.

This place is ridiculously luxurious. Many people don't even know it exists. Once you/re inside it doesn't even feel like you are in Las Vegas anymore. The whole courtyard is enclosed and it smells like lemons.

This is the only show I've seen so far in Las Vegas and I was blown away. I understood the story for the most part but I got lost at times only because I was enthralled by all of the ridiculous acrobatics.  If you're ever in Vegas and you want to see a show this one will leave you speechless.

This park is nice. I've never really brought my dogs to any other park only because this one it pretty much walking distance from my house. It offers an enclosed section in the middle with a few things for dogs to play around with. The outer section is a pretty decent size circle for dogs to run around.

I would have given this Circle K at least one more star if it weren't for their damn credit/debit server. If you're ever in this area and you find yourself at this Circle K I hope you've got some cash on you. I frequent this store and their credit/debit server is out of order at least 2 to 3 times every week. I finally got so irritated, I asked one of the cashiers what the deal was. She stated that it was not just their store but the entire Arizona Circle K server. Now I find that very hard to believe. Do you realize how much revenue Circle K would lose everyday if this were true? It just seems like a company such as this one should be investing a little more time keeping their servers up and running. They should also take a lesson from QuikTrip about the long lines. QT has cashiers that perform multiple transactions at once and, for some reason this Circle K will have a line backed up nearly out the door. This store is located within the industrial section of Broadway Rd so you'd think the employees would try to keep the lines down especially in the morning. At times its been so bad I've had to ask if they can open another register. This part of Phoenix also has a lot of homeless people so its not uncommon to have someone ask you for money or cigarettes.

I haven't found a dish here that isn't good. Plus the chile sauce on the table is ridiculously spicy, but I put it on everything.

I always have an excellent experience at this Chipotle. They are consistently generous with their portions. The only downside is the ridiculously long lines. I realize Chipotle is extremely popular but at times the lines are insane. But its always worth the wait.  It is too bad that they had to increase the prices recently but hey, who hasn't with this economy. One area of improvement would be to keep the ice tea full. Lately I've had to ask them to refill it because its always bone dry. But they always have a back-up ready immediately.

This review is solely based on my experience with the Firearm Department. I came here to purchase my first handgun and the customer service was top notch. They had at least 4 people behind the gun counter helping multiple people. The associate that help me let me handle several handguns so I could get a feel for the one that fit my needs. He informed me on the differences between a few types of 9mms which was ultimately the weapon I opted for. I purchased a Taurus 24/7 9mm that I felt was priced well. He also helped me determine which handgun cleaning kit was best suited for me. The background check process was smooth as can be and only took about 15 minutes from the time I started filling out paperwork to the point were I was approved. Not only was this a very pleasant first time handgun purchase but the particular associate that rang me up also informed me about their indoor firing range. You can come here for target practice but because I purchased a firearm from here he waived the lane fee for me and my friend and I was able to try out my new gun immediately after purchasing it. The whole process was so easygoing I am considering buying a .380 in the near future.

This place is great if you are in the mood for an excellent craft beer. I personally like HopShock which is, you guessed it hoppier than ever. Also if you visit during Sept/Oct you can try their Count Hopula. Its got a great ruby red color and its pretty bitter with a  high alcohol content As for the food no complaints here. Their burgers are amazing and the BBQ sauce is to die for. my fiance asked for two extra servings!!

I used to use their weekly coupon at the Frys across the street due to the fact the accept competitor coupons. But then I finally checked out Fresh and Easy. They offer a lot of everyday low prices that usually are cheaper than other grocery stores. I especially like that their packaged meals are free of preservatives. Also every once in a while I'll find an amazing deal in their clearance food section that I cannot pass up. All in all I have become a regular at this Fresh and Easy.

This Chipotle has surpassed my expectations in every area of customer service. This location can get a little hectic during the lunch rush which basically starts 10 minutes before they open. But instead of waiting until 11am they will actually open their doors early because of the line forming outside. And even when there is a long line of 20+ people, they can move the line in record time. A line all the way out the door will only take about 5-8 minutes. This has to be because they keep this location fully staffed especially when it gets crowded.  As for the food I have never had a problem with any visits at this location or any other locations.

I have had Lisa's Rum Cake on several occasions and every cake was delicious. My favorite flavors are Chocolate Coconut, Chocolate Cannoli and Tuxedo but personally all of  their chocolate cakes are to die for. They strive to make every experience a pleasurable one. They will even offer a grand tour of their cake factory when you pick up your cake. Kelly really enjoys explaining the new technology behind their business.  The owners Kelly and Lisa are the nicest people you will ever meet and their entire operation is family based. When you come in, you'll feel like a member of their family and leave with a awesome  cake.

Food is good but their advertisement is false. I recently purchased their 5 mini tacos with a drink for 4.99. When he rings it up it was 5.98. Really dude - 97 cents in tax on a 5 dollar meal? Turns out they are ringing up each taco at the regular price of $1.09 which comes to 5.45 not 4.99. It's a trivial amount I know but its all about principal. It says 4.99 but apparently you like to charge 5.45. And to top it all off the guy says theirs nothing he can do about it. Uh yeah how bout ringing it up for the advertised price.

El Rico's Dos is a perfect example of what traditional Mexican cuisine should be. They offer all of the everyday Mexican dishes like enchiladas, tacos, chimichangas and anything else you can think of. I haven't found one item on the menu I don't like. Their chips and salsa are delicious and bottomless. One can get carried away if not careful :] If you like salsa with a kick ask for a side of their hotter salsa. It packs a real punch.  They offer an array of bottles beers along with a selection of fine tequilas for margaritas or on the rocks if thats what you like. Also if you decide to stop by on a Tuesday they have a special including $2 tacos and/or Tecates. You can't go wrong with this incredible deal. Their shredded beef and chicken tacos are excellent.  This establishment is very family oriented and the owners care deeply about customer experience and satisfaction. So don't be surprised if Rich the founder of El Rico's Dos stops by your table to ask how everything is.  In conclusion this restaurant is by far one of the best Mexican joints I have visited. I have never had a bad experience here and I most likely never will.   P.S. Their Queen Creek location has recently closed down but this location serves everything the other one did if not more.

This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it weren't for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howie's is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  You'd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

I used to go here all the time but then they dropped a bomb an discontinued one of my favorite plates..... The International Club. I thought all restaurants like these had at least one version of a club on their menu but that doesn't seem to be the case here anymore. Aren't club sandwiches a staple food for diners? Oh well :( They did remodel the whole restaurant awhile back but I haven't been back since the so called "Improvements."
