THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Definitely one of the best sushi in town.  We went 2 weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  We couldn't stop ordering rolls!! The service was great, the sushi is so fresh and tasty.  The value is great too, won't break the bank!    Last week I celebrated MY birthday at home, I decided I wanted them to cater.  My wife ordered $200 worth of sushi we fed 20 people and everyone was amazed at the quality of sushi and needless to say, we all enjoyed it.    I highly recommend this place, it's in my top favs.

We called Belsito after another plumber bailed on us right before we were scheduled to start construction.  They arrived the same day, within 2 hours of our call. Gave us an estimate which was half the price of the first plumber. Leo knew exactly what to do and even made us aware of some pipes that needed to be up to code, which the other plumber never mentioned. Leo was very efficient, professional and friendly, not to mention he saved us when we were in a pickle and even saved us money! I would definitely recommend Belsito Plumbing, thank you Leo!!

Since I got my little puppy Charlie, I was recommended by my friend to go to Choice Pet to buy good dog food.  When I came to the store the staff really knew their stuff!  They were very informative and took the time to explain and to help me choose the right food and products.  My puppy is very healthy, never had any problems and I'm sure it's the good quality food and products I give him and use on him.  I highly recommend this store for those of you who really care and love your pets.   Thank you Choice Pet!!

What a disappointment! My family and I decided to celebrate my birthday at a pizza place and wanted to try this place.  We like to try new places.  We looked on yelp and saw good reviews, so we gave it a try!    We ordered 2 pizzas, and waited more than 40minutes! Mind you, it was a Wednesday night and the place was nearly empty.  One of the pizzas had salami, which was the worst I ever had, the pizza was cold and no flavor.  After one bite I looked at my wife in disgust and she agreed!   The waitress was really nice, service was okay.   She changed our pizza to a plain cheese pizza.  But by then our kids had fallen asleep and we were just annoyed.  I won't be back that's for sure!! What was supposed to be a special night, it was ruined.    I don't recommend this place at all!

My wife and I found another good reason to visit fashion square.  This place has the best macaroons I've ever had.  There's a big variety and great flavors.  The Nutella and the pistacho is our favs.  The people that work there are friendly and I"m sure my wife will want to keep going back!
