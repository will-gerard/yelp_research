Helpful Stinkweeds employee pointed this out as the place for a sandwich in Central Cenpho. It did not dissappoint.   I had tuna, which is garnished with lemon, olives, and arugula. It was a perfect lunch. on a well crafted artisian flatbread.   They have great baguettes for sale, and everything on the menu looked very tempting.   My only gripe is that the menu is very scaled down. A little more variety would make this a 5 star deal for me, but I will be back.   Ambiance is fantastic. Staff was top notch.  Well done.

Come on, anyone who isn't amused by stoned dudes making your lunch is just a fuddy duddy with a stick up their rear.   The fact that these guys are gainfully employed is point one in their favor. The fact that the food doesn't just taste good if you've smoked your breakfast is star number two. Goofy weed paraphernalia entertains you as the most laid back staff on the planet puts your sandwich together. Granted, it takes a few more minutes than fast food, but most lunches that contain actual food will.  I get the "Kind". Turkey bacon mushroom on jalepeno bread. Throw some sprouts on it with mustard. I feel so self righteous and "damn the man" walking out of this place I sometimes double check to make sure I still have on deodorant.   Yep, I'm still a yuppie cheeseball everytime I leave, but for an instant I contemplate dreads and the chill life everytime I grab lunch here.  Or at least the good old bong hit Saturdays of college life....tough call.

Dear Yelpers,  I have many fond memories in the waffle houses around our dear valley. Why? because I went to college, and I wasn't always under the influence of strictly oxygen if you know what I mean.  The place is what it is. Hightened sensory perception makes it "burn a little brighter" perhaps , but its A FRIGGIN WAFFLE HOUSE!  Most Sincerely, Dr. Obvious.

Good stuff.   Watermelon gelato is tasty. Thumbs down for styrofoam.   Kid behind the counter was super friendly but the place was in a busy strip mall and deserted.   Thumbs up for homemade gelato. All for that.   Really want for a place like this to succeed. Good stuff. Large portions.

"Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have.  "Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner" Mom says beaming.  At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her...  Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...  I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.  The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.  I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo.   I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad.   I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic.   It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant.   Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area.

My mom, I swear. She can't get past wine in a box, Costco, or chain restaraunts. But anyway...This was where she took the fam for my brother's birthday this year, because he's into Chinese. Whether it actually was Chinese is debatable.  We started with the lettuce wraps,because that's what you do at PF Changs. Yeah, they were ok, a bit salty.  We got big plates of a bunch of different dishes. Nothing memorable.   My dad sat with his beer and ate nothing, which really cracked me up. He hates Chinese food and there is not any American alternative to choose from. Occasionally we would hear him grunt in displeasure at the whole experience.   Over-hyped, over-rated.   My mother's take: This place is great! We should come here for your birthday Nesto.   wow.

This is our go-to stop when we are headed out of town up the hill to Payson, or beyond to ShowLow.  Locally owned, which is always important, the food is great. They serve wine and beer, and it is a solid bet among a stop filled with greasy, gross fast food and chain madness. It is literally one of the only independants that has stood in the past few years. All the more reason to visit them.  But beside the fact that they are family owned. They are delicious. Thin and crispy pizza, Salads are terrific. My favorite is made with spinach balsalmic, bacon, mushrooms, blue cheese and red onions and homemade croutons oh wow. Wine is good, My girlfriend loves their chicken parmesean with a little alfredo sauce on top.    The alfredo is a little thin for my taste, but I usually just go for a slice and that great salad with a glass of chianti.   Next time you are on the edge of Fountain Hills, check this place out. It was a place we literally just stumbled across one day, because it is practically hidden behind a behemith McDonald's and a Circle K, but what a gem.

1st comment: Booo for the road crew who is blocking off one of the main entrances to this great place. I feel bad that Dilly's is in pretty much a ghost town of a strip mall, and to have a bunch of pipe laying across the entry to it is really a shame and has to be hurting this small business.   I make it a point to eat at Dilly's just really whenever humanly possible. The food is great, the staff is laid back, it is locally owned and has been around since I was in high school, so many good memories in this place.  I go for the veggie supreme and add bacon. No I'm obviously not a vegetarian, but how many sandwich joints give you much more than the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle routine? Dilly's veggie does cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, mushroom, cucumber, sprouts, and ranch. Topped with bacon, it is money.  Soups are great. My one beef is that I wish that they would have some broth based options for soups.   They give a shoutout to local AZ company Poore Brothers as the supplier for their chips, so you know they are a local business who is practicing what they preach. I for one love that.

Right around the corner from my sister's ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes!   The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period.   You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face.   You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place.

Front door the size of my college dorm room and decor inside as old as the hills. But the food is great. A little hole in the wall that always comes through in taste. My girlfriend is addicted to the carnitas tacos. Tiny street vendor style things, she can't get enough of them.   I go for red chile and am always happy when I leave. Yeah it's not fancy, Yeah, it's never going to make it into Phoenix magazine. But it's good. period.

I am sad to say that I used to love this francise. The casual, tie-dyed, cheeky, dancy atmosphere has just gone flat. The corporate boredom has set in.   I was in here last week and it seemed as though the staff went out of their way to be unobservant of our waiting to be seated, with my girlfriend being brushed aside by a staff member going toward the bathrooms without so much as a greeting/acknowledgement.  After half flagging someone down (who seemed quite irritated to be bothered by our presence) we were shown to a seat near the bar.   We waited for a moment and our drink order was taken promptly. After that we chatted. Waiting for our server to come take our meal order, we chatted through many subjects....then crickets. Looking around, there didn't seem to be a server in our area. The bartender occasionally would look in our direction. Finally, the bartender came over and asked if we were ready to order.   Waiting waiting waiting again. The meal took close to 40  minutes to come out. The salad for my girlfriend came out at the same time as the meal, and after the food finally arrived, the bartender, and manager were at our table asking how everything was about every 5 minutes or so.   In all, not a positive experience. My girlfriend's salad was more dressing than anything else. The food was so-so, but the service was dismal.  With all the good places out there ready to be gracious and welcoming, I can't suggest this as a place to drop your hard earned cash.

Went for their buffet last week, and sadly didn't have any sort of memorable experience. The most impressive dishes were the potato cauliflower dish, and the drink. Naan was boring, spiciness of the meat dishes lacked flavor to make them complex. Perhaps it is just that I have been spoiled by the amazing Indian food I have had elsewhere, but this just did not stack up.   To be fair, I have never ordered off this restaurant's menu, so perhaps their cooked to order fare is more impressive, but the lunch buffet was just not doing it for me.   Price was reasonable, so at least there was no sticker shock to add insult to injury.

Ok, so of course I want to be as granola as the next yuppie type, but I gotta be totally straight...I come to Trader Joe's for the wine.   This is my stop for wine. Period. Occasionally I will be distracted by good hummus, or decently priced produce or flowers, but really, for me it's all about the fact that I can find at least half a dozen great red wines for under 6 bucks. As a daily wine person, that's huge.   Also, the Big Day White with a picture of a walking pancake on it is the best white I have had in quite a while. I even bought a bottle of it for my mom, who is a white zin kinda girl and she was impressed too.

This place is money. Seriously ginormous amount of space, It reminds me a little of  a terminal at Sky Harbor for some reason. It is actually very close to where I live, but because my daily commute doesn't directly pass it I often forget about it. This place has the best baguettes in town and everything I have had here is amazing.   I forgot that they default to American cheese on the European sandwiches, so specify that you want another kind. Side note: Why is American cheese the crappiest of all cheeses?...discuss.   They also do homemade ice cream which is very good.   Sandwich, chips and a drink for lunch was about $8.50, but the sandwich is 2 servings for most normal human beings. I always wrap up half for another time.   If you are a bit more adventurous, try the Vietnamese sandwiches which really is what makes this place shine. Great bread, great meat, great veggies. Everything I have tried has been fantastic.

I like Steve's. The sign is wierd and I get visions of Freddy Kruger when I pass the place, but the coffee is good. Local stuff. The place is good for working.  First time I went in I got kinda "my sh*% don't stink" kinda vibe from the barista. It is kinda offputting, so I stayed away for a bit, but have gone back and haven't had any issues.  I prefer Solo down the street, but when I am here and it's convenient, I go to Steve's. Good coffee, good workspace. The end.

Joe's is a Gilbert staple. They have the service down to a science so you can start your journey standing in the back of a line that is about a quarter mile long, and inside of 5 minutes you are sitting at a picnic table under the trees enjoying your grub.  I have been a fan since before I knew why it was important to find and keep places like this thriving.  Joe is cool, and a guy that people who want to succeed in independant business in Arizona should keep their eye on.   The food is quality, the location has been around forever, but keeps fresh with awesome and unique decor (like a life size tractor) and lots of space outside for families with kids to go crazy.  The menu is simple and doesn't try to do too much. The staff is usually very pleasant as well.   My usual is that potato that is as big as my forearm stuffed to the gills with pulled pork, sour cream, chives, bbq sauce, butter, cheese.   and pickles on the side.   If you haven't been to Joe's, you should make it a point.

Where the heck was this when I was in college?? All I got was some lame Ethiopian joint in this building...dumb.  Anyway, went in here after lunch today with a sweet tooth. I'm not exactly a decision person, so I went with the little box of sampler goodness.   Cookies were good, not excellent, but good. macarons are amazing. I tried lemon and coffee/mocha/espresso--delish!  Coffee, very good quality dark roast.   Plus for the recycled containers and sweet service.  I will try actual lunch on the next visit. It looked good from all of the plates I passed on my way out the door.   Ma'am, I'm sorry I got so close, I like food, I'm not a creeper.

Solid indie store. I will have to return again and again to properly peruse and appreciate all the vinyl. Used selection is awesome, and I don't think I saw any crappy music in the place.  Gaga, Bieber, Spears fan? Not the place for you.  You have some taste? Make your way to Stinkweeds.

I was feeling like reliving my Irish days on St. Patty's Day but had no desire to do so with the drunken American idiots that frequent bars for artificial food coloring added to their watered down brew. Strictly speaking Cornwall is far far away from Dublin, but it was close close to where I was working on St. Patty's this year, and I knew I wouldn't likely run into green beer.   Bingo. I have often done delivery of CPC 'samazing grub, but shockingly have never been inside. I was impressed. Mid day darkness isn't my usual m.o. but I was diggin it. Narrow and cozy, it truly was like going back to Ireland. It was the closest thing to a pub I have seen in AZ.  I ordered my Manger's Cider at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the kitchen staff: friendly young guys who were enjoying life. I am a fan of enjoying life while you are working, and I am always sure to have a good meal when the staff is doing so. Got a chicken pot pie pasty, chips with malt vinegar. Good stick to your ribs lunch fare. Red wine gravy was two thumbs up caliber.  Expensive, came to 21 bucks with tip, more than my usual lunch budget allows, but ok for a splurge.   I feel I did my Irish duty and definitely think this lunch counts for more than a green tie.  out.

I have been a fan of Bookman's since high school when I got my entire Senior AP reading list for about $50. It was about 100 books.  That was a while ago, and justifiably their prices have gone up a little bit.   Bring your old stuff, they will sift through it, hand some back and give you a credit slip for store goods for what they keep. Good deal for crap you just have collecting dust in your place anyway.  They just added a coffeehouse recently and I am impressed with the quality of all of their coffee.   One gripe (and the reason this local AZ business doesn't get my 5th star) is that they use an out of state roaster for their coffee.   The coffee is good, but there are many many talented roasters here in the CenPho area who would be more than grateful to get a piece of that AZ pie too. Just food for thought since Bookman's was founded, and thrives due to AZ cash, maybe spread the love to other AZ businesses.  Other than that I love the place.

Midday parking at this place is seriously a joke, but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots.   Pizza was great, my East Coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up, which for an AZ pizza place is a huge kudos. We came to check out both this and the adjoining Pink Spot Coffee and Ice cream. We ate on the ice cream side, so I can't comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side.   Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food.  It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant .

This review is for the Dobson location. This place has the stumbling block of being located in a desperately unfortunate plaza that has all but died and been forgotten about and is a real pain in the ass to get into. I am sure the place would be cleaning up if it had a better spot. That being said, the value for food volume is sure to have the rabid fandom of all of the Dobson high school male athletes.  Eating one of these serious slices is too much food for anyone not doing wind sprints on a daily basis. They are friendly and up front about their slice size giving a life sized outline of what you're getting on the ordering counter and the menu level...so you know what you are in for. Massive pizza consumption.   Good pie, not the best, but definitely not the worst. Mostly I was pleased with the girls working in the shop, being friendly and engaging, explaining to everyone ordering how it worked and not seeming to get tired of it.   I like that they offer wings regular or boneless, and the streamlined menu, curbside service and great staff will most likely put it on a regular rotation for me. Plus it serves as two meals (for me) which is always a plus.

Sacks is where the beautiful people live at lunchtime. The menu board is mind boggling for the newbie. Step back and absorb.   I got the Dali (all of the sandwiches are named for arteests) For me, it was my way of paying edible tribute to Subs by Jim, who went out of business recently. I even bowed my head for a little moment of silence before my first bite,... tear...I always got egg salad there.  The Dali is Egg Salad, bacon, lettuce tomato, cream cheese and mayo. I held off the mayo, because my rule is if the filling has mayo, it is a sin to add more. Cream cheese was a little weird on egg salad, but it grew on me.   Lightning quick service, but it should be with about 8 people behind the counter. Little cookie in the bag was a sweet bonus...haha, puns.  Poore brothers chips, holla! Sweet Maui onion, yeah baby. Has anyone seen Parmesean and Garlic anywhere lately? That is my favorite, and according to the bag they still make it,  but I can't find them.  Like this place. Will be back.

I am really very forlorn at having to give Chompie's a 2 star-er. This place has been my go to weekend breakfast spot for years. Hello, day drinking begining at 7am on game days?? You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them "to go"   But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling..."Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.  Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down.   Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. "Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me.   She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp.   5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?  15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird.   I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.  Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place.   Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit.

This place is fantastic. Artsy, collegiate, chill feel. Nobody bothers you if you want to hole up in the church pew bench against the wall and work, or you can chat about music or philosophy on the couch amongst the hundreds of eclectic books on the shelf.   The owners and employees are friendly without being intrusive, the coffee is impresive in quality and preparation. They use local people to roast their coffee...big plus in my book.   The place is green using real dishes instead of defaulting to paper products, they use organic ingredients whenever they can, and there is free wifi.   All in all a solid, local, genuine shop. Go there. The green monster won't miss you, and you can feel better about yourself for not being a sheep (if even just for a day)

Love that this is an independent ice cream and coffee place. Love the glass menu boards. Love the fact that a pink gorilla is an option at your party at the Pink Spot.   We ate our pizza from next door at Z Pizza in here at lunch. It seemed a little more mellow. Wifi is available here. There were a few suits with laptops sitting around, but it was the lunch hour, so not prime time for ice cream or coffee, so not crowded.  After lunch, I got a latte, and my girlfriend had huckleberry ice cream. From across the room as we were eating our lunch, the server seemed the classic goth/emo kinda kid. Black hair in his face, tragic expressions, more black eyeliner than an Alice Cooper concert, etc. A little old lady ordered from him and was not pleased with his appearance and made no attempt to hide her disdain. He put up with her civilly but it was evident that he was not that into this rude woman either.   When we stepped up to the counter, conversation with this kid was easy. He was genuinely friendly, conversational and his service was A+. Don't really know what that lady's problem was, but you know the type.  He made a perfectly good latte, scooped up the ice cream and we chatted for a few minutes. My girlfriend decided to buy a brown foam trucker hat with the Pink Spot logo on it and wore it out of the shop.   Side note, at my place later that day, my 15 year old nephew stopped by and was so stoked by the hat that we gave it to him. 15 year old boy, trucker hat that says "Pink Spot"....you do the math.   Great experience in customer service, quality coffee, good ice cream and local business.  Go there

Ok, here's the deal. I spent my junior year abroad in Irleand. Pub=happy, community low key place to relax. This place was so full of it's own Irishness that I was floored.   I went in to have a little lunch while waiting for the techies at Best Buy to finish up a computer repair. Sat at the bar. I can say that the place is a magnet for power lunches with more expense account than they know what to do with. Other than that, the place wasn't seeing much by way of traffic. I was the only one at the bar, and their did not seem to be any in there dining "for pleasure".   The walls blast you with plaques of witty sayings about what it means to be Irish. Good thing, because other than that you would have no friggin clue that the place was "Irish" The decor was pompous and straightlaced. Quite honestly a real Irish pub would have kicked this sissy pub's ass.  I had a couple glasses of Cabernet and the short ribs. The ribs were pleasant, meaty rich and the julienned veggies a bit oversteamed for my taste, gravy A-ok.   They carded me which was amusing. The bill came to $22 for the wine and ribs, which seems a little much to me. But then again, I guess it takes some serious lettuce to be that authentic.

I was inspired by Michael's Review of the Day yesterday to write on Tamale Store, because quite frankly I haven't had any lately because we just exited the official Mexican tamale season AKA, the three months where every hispanic relative in the state makes gazillions of dryish to OK tamales and you have to eat them because you are related and they think theirs are the best on the planet, so you better tell them they are or they are going to smack you on the back of the head- season of good cheer.  But back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop.   Lots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic.   I became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.  Beside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love.   They have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.  Don't pass this place up.  Oh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this "tamale season"  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)

Candy Heaven. Cool name. Independant. AZ proud. Surrounded by amazing shops on all sides.   You feel like you are 5 years old here...except that your mom's threats of rotten teeth, belly aches, and spoiled dinner (though maybe ringing in your head) are a thing of the past.  Dive in.

I am worried about my own lifestyle looking back at how many burger joints I have frequented in the last month. But at least they are quality, so I can live with it for now...With places like this in town, WHY are fast food places still alive? Seriously, the brainwashers really have a foothold, because anything else, I just can't wrap my head around.  This place is GREAT. The owner is a real, genuine dude who loves what he does. The burger and fries were fantastic. The bacon on it was glorious and the cheese was perfect. I got the cheddar, but will try swiss next time I have a burger. The beef is perfection on a bun. Fries, crispy potato savory heaven. I am not a mayo guy, so "secret sauce" always has me skeeved ..but the owner told me to try it on the side. It was okay, and spiced well, hint of cumin, ketchup, mayo. I'm still a ketchup purist, but the sauce wasn't a deal breaker.The place is the real deal.  I am going back and will update after I have the Italian beef.   Somedays, you just regret that you only have one stomach.

Incredible coffee. Roasted by the folks over at Cartel, it is a great place in the art district of Scottsdale, so we will usually go out there on date night and have a coffee and walk around.   Staff is always fantastic. Chalkboard menu wall is nice. I don't work on that end of town, but if I did, I would hang there a lot more. Prices are good.

Hey, this may be a poor man's Postino, (I wouldn't know, I haven't been there yet) But this place is GOOD.  Wine, good, and always a great special during happy hour:bonus. Food, very good. Service, attentive, conversational, not snobby (in Scottsdale, you should get some sort of medal for that)   I had a fried egg sandwich the first time I went. Amazing. Fries....they may in fact be what the bible refered to when it said: Manna rained from heaven. They are that good. Dusted with garlic, parsley, grated peccorino, lemon zest, and some other equally addictive goodness.   Second visit, had a burger. Cooked perfectly, topped with bacon, fried egg, wonderful artisian lettuce. MMmmmm.   Both times, had a great red wine. Can't make this man happier than to serve him a solid deep bodied red wine with his meal, and 5th was definitely up to par on that end.  Also both times, had their bruschetta plate, Tried different flavor combos both times...Memorable favorites were the steak and horseradish, and chicken salad. The sweet ones like apple and honey with cheese were a hit with the girls.  Gotta say I am a big fan of this place. Gets noisy on Friday nights, but what the heck, it's a bar with live music in Scottsdale, duh.   In all, highly recommended.

This has been my only experience with this chain, and it wasn't promising. I went in on my way to run an errand at lunch. I was headed to Chipotle that I knew was a solid bet, because it is an unfamiliar part of town for me, but I saw Jimmy John's and decided to give it a go.   I walked in and was greeted by blaring music. Obnoxious blaring music. I got into line behind a weary mom with a young kid. The staff was rude and a little condescending to her when she was asking to split a sandwich between her and her son.   Honestly I felt really bad for the lady who had to put up with the f bomb coming over the speakers and the d-bag college staff who didn't have much respect.  Sorry, that is a huge turn off for me.  I ordered my sandwich and was underwhelmed. It just wasn't anything to rave about. It was OK, but there are much brighter stars in the valley sandwich game.  I know I won't ever go into this particular location again, I may try another Jimmy John's again, but honestly, I probably will go to a Cheba Hut, or a Dilly's a half a dozen times before I do this one again.   Fail.

Okay, here's what I did on my summer vacation, class...Helena watched 'Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead' a few months ago, and before I could say Australian douchebag, I had a state of the art juicer and a bunch of parsley in my fridge. We did a 15 day juice fast and considering I gave up food, wine and coffee for raw juices and a vegan raw hippie lifestyle for more than two weeks, I am surprised everyone involved is still alive.   Seriously it was a lot more pleasurable and cathartic an experience than I thought it would be going into it. One bright shining light in the whole situation was this Jamba Juice. Sadly a lot of the independent juice outfits just haven't made it in this economy, but this chain did a nice job of filling the gap in my mid-day fix. Carrot juice with wheatgrass was my little slice of heaven every day.   The staff is friendly and obliging. Only loss of a point for less than superior cleanliness behind the lines, because if I can see into your kitchen I want it to be immaculate. And I was starving daily, so my standards were probably a little harsh.

Let me preface this review with what was certainly an unfair beginning bias. I have long been a fan of Fifth and Wine. It was my first wine bars, and still holds a firm grip on my affections, preconceived notions and standards.   That gotten out of the way, I really enjoyed Postino. They decor was skillfully designed to project casual minimalist and hipster sophisticated simplicity. The place was jam packed at 8 pm on a Wednesday evening, one of the raw spectacles that is such a stark opposition to Payson life that I very often now find myself absorbing the fascinating juxtaposition. But total sidebar aside, the Argentinian Merlot was pristine. It seemed unpretentious in its offering of beers as well. We ordered a bowl of olives that was not even close to being on my radar, but Helena insisted and I am stoked that she did. About half a dozen varieties, and all of them were gorgeous and paired with the bruschetta plate and wine.   The bruschetta bread was a bit soft and thick for my liking. I prefer the crisper thinner cut on the bread, but totally just my personal preference. Some might prefer the doughy bread texture for their app. We chose our four to include a selection of savory and sweet; classic Margherita, white bean paste with tomatoes (we added pesto), warm artichoke spread, and ricotta with pistachio and date. Not a single one disappointed.   The waitress was genuinely likable, accommodating and very helpful   I chose a ciabatta sandwich with a nice brie, fig jam and prosciutto, garnished with arugula. Helena had black bean soup. Both were really well crafted with full complex bold flavors. The food menu was simple but all of it was perfectly matched to the wine. There was a lot of moaning and nodding going on during the meal, which is always a good sign.   The price points were also a really nice surprise. Very moderate for a good clean well constructed food. We will definitely be returning to travel through the rest of the menu.

Here is my story on Five guys. Fries bathed in a peanut oil bubble bath will always make me happy. It reminds me of sunshine and puppies and all things that are pure and good in life. Five guys uses peanut oil and I am all for that.   I took the advice of a reviewer and got a little guy (with cheese and bacon) and It was more than plenty with the fries and drink.  Peanuts while you wait. I was a bit amused by the text on the side of the box warning not to remove from the shop (on account of peanut allergies) Legal posturing for liability purposes always gets me...but good form.  I like that all the toppings you want are included at no additional charge. LIke mushrooms and grilled onions and about a dozen other options. That in a way justifies the higher prices, because while yeah there is the lamo who just wants ketchup, most will take advatage of that shiz and pile it high...yeah, like I did.  The coke fountain was seriously out of Star Trek The Next Generation.  I watched it... don't judge--if you got the reference you did too. I'm pretty sure Picard got his Earl Grey out of the same stinkin machine.   Touch Screen. I push Coke. A dozen new icons come up. Would I like, Cherry Coke, Lime Coke, Lemon Coke, Orange Coke, Vanilla Coke? Just Coke thanks, I add my citrus the old fashioned way...from a piece of citrus.   Bag was greasy, so I know I am going to like it. Yeah I did.  Go. You will feel a bit guilty, so eat a salad for dinner and run an extra mile. But do it.

This place has been on our bucket list for a while now and totally lives up to the hype. This place is the epitome of what deserves 5 stars.  The food is spot on. Orange juice is pristine. Every single thing that touched our lips was incredible. We sat at the bar, and the waitress was friendly and efficient. People stand in hellish heat outside to wait for a table here, and let me tell you, it is worth it.   Go. Put down your computer and run to eat here.
