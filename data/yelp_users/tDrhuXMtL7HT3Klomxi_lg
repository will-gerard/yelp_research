I think its awesome being able to get the same clothing you could get from top notch store for only half the price at Ross. But I shouldn't have to sacrifice receiving good service just to get a discount. This is my first time yelping.   I've been offered to yelp after I got very poor service in the past and turned it down  but after receiving this poor service I had to yelp.... this goes out to the lady the back of the store in the fitting room.  And She was very rude and she had a very very poor attitude....  good Luck Ross.  I did not will not buy from here.   son of this yelp account

Went here last Wednesday.   I ordered what I was told a popular items: Kobe meatball with ricotta.  I also age chicken parmesan with a dice of Pene pasta.  For desert their oreo malt.  I spit all of this with a friend.  Thr meatball was so salty we both could not eat it.  The server could have cared less when he asked why we did not eat it.  The chicken was bland and basic.  Finally the malt.  My fault here because I guess I did not read the menu clearly because was mini size with a plate of deep fried Oreos.  I thought it was just a oreo malt.   All in all I will never go back.  Too many othet choices in vegas with much better food.

Purchased a car that had defective window tint.  I brought it to the attention of a sales manager Steve and he said they would pay to remove it as a gesture of good faith.  Really?  It is so defective that one woukd need glasses to correct the vision to see through it.  To me this should have been replaced.  Now fast forward to getting it removed.  Rob the services manager had me drop off my car the night before so I could get this done same day.   It is now 3:30 and they still havr not taken it to the third-party to get this done.  So it will not be until tomorrow.   So another day trying to manage family life without a car.  Thanks Carmax.

Went out to their location on Broadway today and I was very excited to look through their boneyard at the recommendation of a representative I spoke to on the phone.  The representative was very helpful and knowledgable and provided to me the idea of using the boneyard because the piece of stone I needed was not very large.  When I arrived I was directed to the area.  Not a lot to choose from but beggars cannot be choosers so I have heard.  We did find a piece we liked and the folks in the yard got a "Sales Person".  This is where things went awful and based on this experience I received I would NEVER spend one cent with this company.  So sad that one person can taint a organizations reputation but he did.    First off he quoted me figures WAY higher than what I was quoted on the phone.  When I questioned this I was treated horrible.  Like I was asking for them to give me something for nothing.  I was spoken to like I was in idiot and he was very demeaning in his conversation style.  Who needs this?  Not me.  What he did not know is that I can afford what I want, a simple better approach may have yielded them a sale and even referral business.  But the way I have come to learn that they treat customers and do not honor previous pricing commitments, No Thanks!

Their affiliation with gorilla, a group that plays the game of bands selling tickets to play, is why they get one star.  The ticket game is just to rip off bands who simply want to play.  They could instead grow a reputation of being a venue that attracts quality talent and then the audience will come.  Instead they go the low quality route.  Not impressed.

This place.got my highest rating not because of the food but 100% because of Jessi our server. She was one of the greatest I have ever had; attentive,  personable, genuine,  and friendly just to say a few things about her.  Now the food.  The menu left me and my family lost in great choices trying to decide what to order and the decisions were difficult.   The food itself was ok, nothing really blew us away but we will come back because we all want to try something else.   The pizza was good and we all liked the chicken parmigiano.  The fish and chips were just average.  We tend to share our meals and the thoughts were unanimous.    See ya.next time.and we only want to sit in Jessi's section.

It hurts me to have to give any Chipolte a single star but I am afraid that I have to.  Yesterday while enjoying a salad at this location I noticed a little black bug laying on its back in the bottom of my bowl with its feet kicking up in the air.  Gross, YUCK, and seriously were my initial thoughts as I held down my stomach flipping.  When I brought this bug to a workers attention I was told that they "Try" to wash the lettuce but sometimes this happens.  Sorry to say that this does not help me forgive the experience because I cannot help but think of all the bugs I may have eaten and not have known it.

Just got home,  my heal is bloody.  What?  I knew it hurt but did not.know it was bleeding. Shouldn't they have said something and treated their mistake?

Best drinks!  Love the Strawberry Aqua Fresca. Tacos are Yum, fish and chicken are my favorite.   Guacamole  is worth adding .

Perfect Grilled Cheese was amazing and worth a repeat  visit.  Chicken club lacked unique flavor and was average.  The BLT was great with the bread making the sandwiches.  Now for the sides: tomato soup was delicious and a perfect complement to the grilled cheese.  Shoe string fries were great, nothing not to like about them and the green pea salad in peanut sauce was delicious.  We will definitely return for another try!

One thing I can say.about this airline, it is consistent,  consistently horrible.  Always seems to be late, dirty planes, workers with outwardly poor attitudes, missing customer service, long and hassle-filled boarding process......  it does not end and is always consistently the same.  I dread flights on this airline.   This review should at least offer one solution so it is not just a rant:   I suggest at least for the boarding process to adopt SWA in the pillars but instead line up by rows instead of zones.  The current status this and status that followed by zones is slow, scattered and annoying.

Ripoff is the only to accurately describe my experience.   To further explain the price was too high for what you got in return which was overcrowding to the point inhibiting participation.  The experience could all be had on wii and a local gym.

Stopped by for a rare adult timeout: appatizers and cocktails.   Noshed on devild eggs and rosito balls.  Both were good.  Nice little place, had a great time.

Great food but long waits.  I love their fresh menu with the favorites being: chicken fried chicken,  blackened chicken alfredo, tacos carbone, salmon, rib eye.....  just to name a few.  We often just do takeout and this works great.
