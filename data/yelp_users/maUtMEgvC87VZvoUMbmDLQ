This place is awesome!  Truly one of the best Seafood Mexican restaurants I have ever been to.  The ambience, food, customer service is all top notch.  I have been  at MPH over 5 times and always been impressed.  I have tried various dishes from fish, fajitas, and tacos.  They have great sauces and everything is homemade.  I highly recommend this establishment for a good meal and truly authetic.  A+ all across the board.

If you enjoy fresh seafood and Mexican food, this is the place to go.  I have dined in this establishment multiple times and every time I walk away very impressed.  I believe they have the best ceviche in all of Phoenix.  They do several different types, and since I'm allergic to shrimp, I always get the fish ceviche.  Also the raw oysters are fresh and always on point.  It's always fresh and taste amazing.  So dishes I highly recommend are the whole fried fish, Filete de Pescado and the Molcajete is perfect for sharing.  Beautiful interior and super friendly staff.  My go to restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Must try, you wont be disappointed. Outstanding food and service.

Another solid meal in the books!  Hands down, my top 3 restaurants in the Valley.  Recently I took my boss to this place, he's from the Mid-west and hasn't had any true Mexican food.  He was thoroughly impressed with this place.  We started our meals with fresh oysters, which were amazing, followed by the complimentary ceviche.  It was delicious and had a fresh crispy taste to it  My boss went with the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed and loved, while I stuck with my good to meal.  The Molcajete, which is a fried fish.  It's probably my favorite dish that they have there.  It comes with corn tortillas, beans and rice.  Everything was on point and the food was outstanding.  They have great ambiance in the restaurant and the service was impeccable.  For all my yelpers, please give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did.  For an authentic seafood Mexican meal, this is your spot!

Mariscos Playa Hermosa, or I like to call MPH, hands down the best authentic Mexican seafood restaurant in the Valley!  I have written couple of reviews on this place and every time I come here, I walk away extremely happy!  It really doesn't get better than this.  They recently remodeled their restaurant, they now have more seating, re-did the bathrooms, and they now include a full bar!  This place is awesome!  Ambiance-  Once you walk into this restaurant you are taken away by the bright colors, vibrant atmosphere and the great smelling food!  You will notice how clean the place is and how friendly the staff is.  This place is a family owned restaurant and the owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Jose and Maria are wonderful people and will always welcome you.  Food-  This is what it's all about right?  The food is the main attraction and they have some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted.  I am a huge fan of seafood and this place has some of the best!  I have sampled many dishes here, but what has me always coming back is the fresh oysters, fried fish, ceviche, and their amazing sauces that they make.   Give this place a try if come to Phoenix, cause trust me, this is where all the locals go to eat.  Hands down, one of the best establishments I've been to!

After a long hard work week, my girlfriend and I wanted to go out and get some good comfort food.  She wanted to go to Lo Lo's and as you can see based off my previous review of that place, I really wasn't too excited.  I found this place on yelp and convinced my girlfriend to come here.  Oh boy, I'm glad we did.  We heard all the good reviews of the Chicken fried steak and we had to give it a try.  We ordered Fried Okra as a appetizer and I got the large chicken fried steak and she got the smothered pork chop.  Everything was a hit!  The gravy was amazing and the food was great!  The place was pretty packed for a Friday night, the service was great and everything was on point.

I would highly recommend Rose and her staff at this location.  I chose this place based off a lot of the reviews and they didn't disappoint.  I was married over the past weekend and rented out some tuxedo's for the event.  Stephanie was extremely accommodating and helped my party.  I had 8 groomsmen and everything turned out well. I would highly recommend Rose Tuxedo, they provide excellent customer service and very easy to work with.

Postino's.  I've been to this location for couple of happy hours and recently been here for lunch.  They are known for their variety of bruschetta boards, and selection of wines.  It's a good place to stop by for a good bite to eat, but really nothing on the menu that is really hearty or satisfying.  Great place for lunch or someplace to stop by and snack on some stuff.  They have decent meat and cheese boards.  I would recommend, but not for a dinner place.  There are several locations.  I have been here, Kierland, and the one in Gilbert.

Blizzard machine was broken, so I settled for a Dilly bar.  Very disappointing.  Just like this review.

This place is awesome.  It's a small restaurant in a strip mall.  They have really good breakfast.  I love their biscuits and gravy.  The prices are really reasonable and have great customer service.  It's funny I have eaten at this place 3 times now, and it seems I see the same customers in there.  They must have a lot of regular customers.  My waitress was very good and always checked up on us.  I would recommend this place for breakfast.

I have been shopping at BBQ Galore for about 14 months.  I usually shop in the Chandler location, but ended up stopping by the Scottsdale location near desert ridge.  After experiencing the lack of customer service I will not be shopping here ever again.  As a consumer, I have purchased a grill, smoker and other various items such as brushes, sauces, wood chips, and other utensils for BBQing.  I went into the desert ridge location on January 27th around 1:00.  I purchased woodchips, bbq sauce, rub, and rib racks.  I even told the sales representative I dont think these racks are going to fit in my smoker, but I'll buy them anyways. I ended coming back 1 hour later and wanted to refund the rib racks.  As I expected the rib rack wouldn't fit in my smoker.  The sales rep refused to take back the product and said "the box was in poor condition and will not be taking this back.  The same sales representative that I purchased my products from earlier.  He mentioned the manager Chris will be in tomorrow if I wanted to talk to him.  I left the store, pretty ticked off.  In conclusion, I have dropped over 1200.00 in the past 14 months and never had any issues with the store.  I even have recommended people to this place.  My friends of mine have told me, that I should just shop at Home Depot down the road, cause they are cheaper and have the same products.  Because the sales representative at BBQ Galore, refused to take my rib rack, which was 15 dollars, you guys have lost me as a customer and I will never recommend this place again.  Also I will post on every social media sites, such as facebook, yelp, white pages how horrible the customer service is, and how badly they treated me.  So instead of refunding my product that I purchased for 15.00 bucks, you have lost a customer and someone that will bad mouth how bad this place is.  I even explained to the sales rep how poor this is and this is not how you treat someone that has dropped so much money at your stores.  Piss poor customer service

I've always been a fan of Harkins Theatres.  For the most part they are friendly, and the theatre's are clean!  They allow you to refill your large popcorn and they have loyalty cups!

Best of Hong Kong,  This has been probably my favorite Chinese place in the Valley.  I don't think they necessarily have the best tasting food, but their food reminds me a lot of my parent's cooking.  I tend to take co-workers there, they have really cheap lunch specials and a lot to chose from.  I usually end up getting off work, and spot by and grab it to go.  They have really good food and would recommend this place.  The service can be slow, but it's mostly because they have 1 or 2 waitress that take care of the entire place.  It's a family owned restaurant and has had some changes in the Kitchen.  In my opinion, I don't think the food is as good as it once was, it's fallen off a little.  Still give it a try, good Cantonese Style cooking.

I work in the area and there's a really good Hawaiian BBQ place nearby. I discovered this place by people in my building were talking about this place, so I wanted to give it a try. Well, I'm glad I did. This place is excellent. Friendly staff, mom and pa operation.  Outstanding food. They have variety of mixed plates, soups, and great salads. I always get mixed places, they consist of Katsu or teriyaki chicken or their beef. Macaroni is good and you get two scoops of rice. Great lunch spot, check it out.

Flo's...I'm a fan.  Been living in AZ for over 10 years and this is one of the most consistent Asian/American cuisine in the valley.  The food is pretty solid.  They have a wide variety of dishes, I'm a fan of most of them.  They have tasty curry dishes and great soups,  The lunch portions and prices are decent, but their dinner prices are a little pricey.  They used to have 5 dollar dishes on Saturday, but now they are 6, I usually hit that up and their happy hours.  One thing I do love about Flo's is their Lettuce Wraps.  They have Lao and Chinese style...go with Chinese!  Hence my background.  This place is pretty solid, I would highly recommend.

I have eaten at Havana Cafe several times, and the food and experience gets worst every time.  This latest experience will be my last time.  I was not impressed with the service or the food.  I took my girlfriend there on a Friday and had dinner around 8:00.  The drinks took forever to arrive, our food actually arrived before the drinks did.  I ordered the Chicharrones de Pollo which is like a fried chicken dish.  I went to take a bite and didnt realize it had foil on the bottom of the chicken.  The chicken wasn't cooked to order, it was pretty much reheated.  You ever taken a bite of food and bit down on foil, not the most pleasant experience on the pallet.  The chicken was warm and they didnt even do a good job re-heating it.  My girl ordered the Sailors Paella which had a variety of seafood on rice.  The dish was 24,00 but not nearly worth the price.  The dish said their were suppose to have crab, calms, mussels, scallops, shrimp, fresh fish on safforn rice.  I couldnt find any crab, scallops or calms in the dish.  It was mostly fish in the dish.  Not only that, but the dish had a fishy smell to it.  The seafood clearly wasn't fresh.  It was old seafood.  Not impressed at all.  The total bill was around 60 bucks.  I felt like we were scammed out of our money.    Ths is the last straw, we will not be eating at this place again.  Also when we left the restaurant there were bunch of people standing outside smoking, (next to a liquor/smoke shop)  I barely could breathe walking out of there.

The Phoenician really dropped the ball and disappointed.  This was one of the worst customer service experiences or lack of I've ever had with a resort.  If I could give it a negative star I would in a heartbeat!  First all of all, I chose this place because my lady and I had a been here a while back and had a decent time at the lounge  and I wanted to come back here and purpose to her.  So I booked a the Delux executive suite for the night and reserved a table at J&G steakhouse for July 3rd.  Keep in mind I booked the room and made the reservation 1 week in advance.  When I booked the room I asked specifically does the room have a good view from the balcony and the lady said I would have a wonderful view from my room. I told them I will be purposing to my girlfriend and I want this night to be perfect...  July 3rd- I called the front desk at 11:00 and requested a early check in...They told me the room won't be ready probably until 4:00.  I told them I wanted to check in early so I can decorate the room for my engagement.  The lady told me I had to come down in person and at that point they could do an early check in for me.  Why in the f*ck do I need to come down in person for a early check in?  Regardless, I drove down to the place and checked in.  I finally got a call at 2:30 and told me my room was available.  I told the front desk lady I planned on having a Mariachi band to come to my room and play 3 songs, would that be OK?  They denied my request and said it wouldn't be allowed in the room, but could do it at the lobby.  I was pretty pissed, so I decided to cancel the Mariachi idea.  I arrived at my room and noticed it was on the 1st floor. Room 1010.  Since it was July 3rd, they had a concert and people were playing corn hole (baggo) and it was LOUD!  The view was garbage, it was a view of the pool and people walking around drunk.  I completely felt like I was duped.  I should of carried though with my mariachi plan, because since they had a concert outside, I doubt they would of heard the band in my room.  Overall I was pretty pissed and upset with the Phoenician, but since it was a special night for my lady, I didn't want to cause a scene or show any disapproval of the resort.  This place wasn't accommodating at all.  They didn't care about me as a guest or didn't do anything to make this night special.  There are a lot of great luxury resorts in the Scottsdale area, I highly recommend you go to one of those places instead of here.  This place is a joke.  Absolute nightmare.  Also I had some charges to my room, that I wasn't expecting, but I don't have the time or effort to write about that....  To top it off......I requested a booth for our dinner at J&G steakhouse and they couldn't even accommodate that, keep in mind I asked a week ago for this request.  Our reservation was at 9:00  We basically had a table in the middle of the restaurant and was poorly set up.  You could hear the fireworks going off, but had no view to even see them.  SMH.   Feel free to read my review on that horrible dinner experience as well.  To the staff and management at the Phoenician....You call yourself a 5 star resort?  You got to be kidding me.  You can probably guess, a future wedding won't be planned at this place.  I'm done.

I've been here before for dinner, but this time we stopped by for a early happy hour dinner.  I was thoroughly impressed.  The food, ambiance, and service was all top notch!  We stopped by yesterday and ordered a few drinks.  We then ordered the green chili stew, and fresh guacamole.  Then we ordered the big a$$ burger.  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  They have an awesome happy hour and I would highly recommend this place.

One of my favorite places for great Persian food.  I've been coming to this place since 2008.  They have a variety of great dishes.  One of my favorite dishes is the Tah Dig. Its a appetizer and great to share with. Its delicious with the cucumber yogurt dip. My go to dish is probably the Koobideh.  Its  mixture of ground beef with various seasoning, its awesome with the jasmine rice.  On this night I decided to go with the Loobia polo & koobideh which is in this picture.  Overall we had good customer service and the food was delicious as usual.  I would recommend this place  One strange encounter during the night though, I can't stop thinking about, I just have to share.  So I arrived around 7:30 and put my name down for 4 people.  I was told it's going to be a hour or hour and 20 mins wait.  I told them that is fine.  Well my fiancee told me that her younger brother and his lady will be joining us.  So a total of 6 now.  So I went back in with my lady and said, can you make it a table for 6...Then they proceeded to say, "We can seat you right away."  That was strange.  If we wanted a table for 4, the wait was over a hour, but if we wanted a table for 6, we were seated right away...Interesting.  Regardless, that aside the meal was great and we received good customer service.

Sorry, for getting this review up so late, been busy planning wedding stuff....Anyways, I was in town with some buddies for March Madness and my bachelor party.  So with all the debauchery and buffoonery that was going on, we ended up last minute choosing Lawry's for dinner.  So I do apologize if I can't write a detailed review or remember everything, I was well intoxicated by dinner time.   So we arrived for our 8:30 dinner reservation.  The place is located just off the strip, and there were plenty of parking.   I remember we sat in a very spacious room.  There were 8 of us, and we ordered countless shots and bantered throughout the dinner service.  We didn't bother with any appetizers, we all just ordered either the prime rib or rib-eye steaks, we weren't here to mess around.  I remember when you ordered your meal, it came with their "signature" salad and all the sides were complementary!  So we ordered a various amount of sides and enjoyed our meat as we feasted and enjoyed many beverages and shots!  As we were finishing our meals, we realized the place was empty and they actually close at 10:00, which is a little weak, especially for a Saturday night.  Other than that, the service was top notch, food was delicious and everything was on point.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place and wished one opened up in Phoenix or the Scottsdale Area.

"Embarrassed".  I'm little embarrassed to have dine at this establishment at least 10 times and have yet to write a review of this place.  So a good buddy of mine met up for lunch, so we ended up choosing Delux, we both have eaten here before and we knew what they brought to the table.  This place is a great place for burgers and fries.  They are a little higher in price than your average burger joint, but you'll notice the difference in the taste and the quality of ingredients.  I believe they use a better cut of meat than most burger joints and every time I walk away satisfied. They are located off Camelback and 32nd street and are open til 2:00 in the morning.  My good friend and I ordered the same thing, The delux burger and each ordered a basket of fries.  The fries come in a shopping cart, nicely presented along with couple of dipping sauces. ( Ketchup and a Aioli)  I requested the burger medium rare and was cooked very nicely and the fries were nice and hot.  Overall I would highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere and the service was great.  As mentioned its a little more expensive than more burger places, but its worth it.  If you are craving for the classic burger and fries, hit this place up, you'll be glad you did.

Good stuff!  My fiancee is a huge fan of this place and will be back for sure.  So it's like a Mexican and Asian fusion with some Jamaican flare.  They have a lot of dishes and you can combine the different flavors.  The only complaint is the ordering can get a little confusing.  I remember ordering a dish on the card and what came out was something different from what I was expecting.  Regardless it was good and delicious.  My lady loves the Emerald Chicken and Polo Diablo, which were good, but I really enjoy the jade chicken and chinese bbq pork.  Overall they have a good variety of different flavors.  You can get bowls, burritos, and quesdillas.  I would recommend this place.

I love it!  This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show and I was completely blown away.  I understand everybody has their opinion but I thought this was an amazing show!  The performance, lighting, music, everything was outstanding.  We had great seats and was blown away by the performance and difficulty of some of the stunts.  The wheel of death?  Come on, that was pretty damn impressive and those guys are amazing!  I thought the story was easy to follow, really not that difficult, but it seems based off some of these reviews, some people are baffled or had difficulty following it.  Strange. This show was one of a kind, and my fiancee and I really enjoyed it.  The only complain probably was the concession stand area.  Holy cow, they were charging an arm and leg for drinks and snacks.  Think of your local movie theater, TIMES 5!  I believe a soda was like 12 bucks and popcorn was another 10.  Welcome to Vegas!

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Flemings, they really stepped up their game and service.  I actually have eaten here couple of years ago and it really didn't leave me with a positive experience.  I felt places like Flemings and The Keg were not quite a top end steak house, but  just a step up from a Longhorns or Outback, boy I was completely wrong.  We ended up choosing Flemings cause my wonderful sister and brother in law got me a gift card to this place.  So we ended up coming here for my birthday on 12/26 for dinner.  We made a reservation for 7:30 and were seated right away.  The food, service, and ambience was all top notch.  Everything was great and I appreciate the great service.  We ordered the sweet chile calamari for appetizer and double thick pork chop and king crab for our dinners.  The server brought out two lobster tails at first, but I let him know I ordered the king crab, so we had a little hiccup, but the manager was nice enough to give us a 25 gift card for the mistake.  I let her know it was ok, just a simple mistake.  I don't blame the waiter, he seemed extremely busy and he really did a great job.  That's outstanding customer service!  Our drinks were constantly refilled and the service team did a great job checking up on us.  Overall, pretty solid experience.  A week later we ended up going to Dominicks for dinner, and I must say it was on the same level as that, (check out my later review).        We will be adding Fleming's to our list and will be coming back. I know Sundays they do a good prime rib dinner I've been hearing about, so I'm anxious to use our gift card and sample it. Overall I would recommend this place.

I'm not a huge outdoors hiking guy, but I do enjoy heading out to Piestewa Peak and get a good workout in and enjoy the scenery.  I've lived in AZ for over 8 years now, and been to several good hiking areas, such as Camelback, S. Mountain, Papago, McDowell Mts, etc, but I would say PP is probably my favorite.  Parking is never a problem and always friendly people on the trails.  For me this is a good challenging hike, it's around a mountain, and think of it as a outdoor's stairs machine.  I'm a big guy, so carrying my weight makes it a great workout for me.  The hiking trail can get pretty busy on early in the mornings, you'll see some people run up and down, and some really in shape people.  For me it generally takes about two hours.  On the way up, I'll stop couple of times to catch my breath and take in the scenery.  When you know you'll close to the top, you'll see a metal railing, and when your at the top, it's a beautiful view of the Valley.  I would recommend this place for everybody.

Phoenix area doesn't have the best BBQ joints but I consider joes and little miss BBQ prolly the best in the valley. I've had joes multiple times and it's always solid. I usually get the sampler but sometimes I get the brisket sandwich or their loaded naked potatoes. There are usually long lines but it's served cafeteria style and the line moves pretty fast. I would say pulled pork, brisket, and chicken are A grade but the pork ribs are B grade. Overall still solid and would recommend this place....

Stopped by here for lunch on Sunday, and I wish I didn't.  My girlfriend and I met another couple here for lunch.  We didn't really have to wait and was seated promptly.  The combination of slow service and average food was really disappointing to me, especially I generally enjoy this place.  The service...Our waitress was just overwhelmed.  It looks like she had over 8 tables and was running like a chicken with its head cut off.  We ordered some chicken nachos as a appetizer which was probably the highlight of the experience but our lunches too forever to come out.  We all pretty much ordered the same thing.  Lunch Special.... half sandwich and soup, or salad, or pizza. We added fries for couple of bucks and a kale chicken salad.  Finally when the food came out, everything was warm or bland.  My roast beef dip was poorly made and the bread was hard and crusty.  No wonder why you had to dip it.  My french onion wasn't even hot.  How can you serve luke warm french onion soup?  The fries were terrible, nothing is worst than fries that have been sitting there for a while.  Not hot, not warm, just blah!  My girlfriend ordered the Grill Chicken Kale Ceaser Salad.  She started to eat her salad and I said, that's a pretty sad looking salad, isn't there suppose to be grilled chicken in it?  She didn't even notice.  So I wanted to flag down my waitress but she was no where to be found, so I let a busboy know, since he was the one that actually brought the food out.  He said he will take care of it.  Well my girlfriend was pretty full from eating the nacho's and some of my food and about 15 minutes later the grilled chicken finally came out.  It was no more than 3 little strips of chicken.  My girl and I looked at each other and just shook our heads.  We didn't even bother eating it.  I wasn't really full or satisfied, but I just didn't want to eat anymore of this lunch.  I filled myself up on water and diet coke and requested the bill.  I still tip 20% cause it really wasn't the waitress fault.  Everything was just poor execution.  I'll give The Yard House a pass this time, cause it's never been like this.

I have reviewed this place and gave it 3 stars the first time, well after numerous experiences after that, this place has sadly fallen from that.  I can tolerate mediocre American-Chinese food for a week night dinner, but I won't put up with horse sh*t customer service from this establishment.  As mentioned coming from a Asian background, I think this place is average at best, but my fiancee really likes it, but this will be the last time we put up with this place.  We mostly get our meals to go, considering when you walk in this place, there is a strong smell of sewage.  Tonight we ordered 3 different dishes, Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Seared Chicken.  The food we brought back was extremely salty and the beef in the dish has a old and had a rotten smell to it.  It was very pungent and virtually inedible.  The honey seared chicken had the batter fall off and the chicken was very mushy.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the only dish tolerable.  The meal was a disgrace and left me extremely p*ssed off.  To top that off, I had to deal with some snotty brat kid at the counter.  I requested some red chile paste to go, but she refused and said they are no longer allowed to give it to customers that are ordering to go?  I said are you serious?  I asked, well you can charge it to my card and I'll pay for it.  They offered some red chile paste in the packets, but they taste like crap.  After thinking about it, I said forget it, this is freaking stupid that I would have to pay for that.  It's a matter off principle.  So, tonight is the last straw.  I refuse to pay for this crap every again.  I don't give many one star reviews but the combination of p*ss poor customer service and border line rotten meat, this place earned it!  We've ordered at this location multiple times in the past, but now they refuse to give out red Chile paste is ridiculous.

This place is pretty darn good.  I go to Carolina's at least twice a month, sometimes more.  They don't necessarily have the best Mexican in town, but they are really consistent and solid.     Since I have moved to Phoenix, I would say for the prices, its one of the best places to dine in or get carry out.  My lady and I have sampled majority of their dishes and most of them are really good.  Our favorite is their green chili.  Get that on your Carne Asada burrito!  It's my go to meal.  We usually get their combo plates, the enchiladas, burritos,  machaca, tacos, chorizo are really good, the only thing I didn't care for are their tamales.  Maybe I'm used to eating my family's tamales, but just not a fan of theirs. Also make sure you get a sample of their salsa, its really good, not really spicy, but flavorful.  I could drink that stuff.  Overall, I would highly recommend.

LA Fitness, where do I start.  I've been a member pretty much since I've moved to AZ, which was over 8 years ago.  I moved several times during that duration and the good thing is, there are a lot of LA Fitness Gym's around the area.  There are some really good ones and there are some bad ones.  Unfortunately this location in PV, is one of the bad ones.  The only reason why I come to this location is it's the closest and most convenient to my house.  I used to live in Chandler and go to the one off Chandler and 48th street.  That gym was very clean, machines were updated, also most cardio equipment have TV's, everything was top of the line.  This one in Paradise Valley is the opposite.  Most of the equipment is old, and a lot of machines are always broken.  The sauna room has been out of service several times, and the pool and Jacuzzi area is old and outdated.  A combination of that and lackluster staff, makes this gym very mediocre.

This place is pretty solid.  The prices are reasonable and the food is really good.  Warning, they give you a spice level of 1 to 5.  I like it spicy so i chose a 4.  It was extremely spicy.  Next time I will probably scale down to a 2.  I had the veggie egg rolls and drunken noodles.  They were really good.  I ordered some Thai Ice tea to wash down the food, cause it was spicy.  Overall solid experience, the spiciness was my fault for ordering it that hot, but the taste of the food was solid.  I would recommend this place.

If there were only 5 Mexican Restaurants I could eat in Phoenix.  I would put Marisco's Playa Hermosa number 1, and Los Reyes prolly 4th or 5th.   This place is good.  They have a variety of Torta's and a others such as tacos, burritos, etc.  My girlfriend and I shared the Torta Del Rey and some other dish she ordered.  Overall pretty good, I would come back if I'm in the area.

I have been eating at this establishment for a long time now.  I think their BBQ is great, but not the best.  I've had a variety of different dishes.    Pulled pork-above average Brisket-above average Burned Ends-Excellent Pork Ribs-average.   The best item they have on the menu is their Beef ribs.  Oh my.  You cant get beef ribs at a lot of bbq joints, but Lucilles have the best in the valley.  They used to charge by half a rack or a full rack, now they charge by the bones.  (3,5,7)  The prices have gone up alot recently, but still you can't get beef ribs anywhere else that's close to theirs.  The sides are ok, nothing to rave about.  The biscuits are good with the cinnamon butter.  Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing.  It's like crack in a mason jar.  It's the best.

Our go to theater in the Valley!  My fiancee and I watch a lot of movies during the year.  We live across the street and pretty much watch one or two movies a month.  So I would say I've been here over 20 times.  Overall, I think it's perfect and great for what you would expect from a movie theater.  Since I have been going there, all the movies start on time, never had any issues with the sound or problems with the films.  We rarely ever have to wait in line to buy tickets, and generally the concession line moves pretty quickly.    Obviously the prices for snacks and popcorn is expensive, but I understand that's how they make most of their profits,  Ticket sales, most of it goes back to the producers, Hollywood, film, etc.  They have loyalty cups which are nice, cheap re-fills.  Also if you buy a large popcorn, save the bag, cause you can use it again for a re-fill the next visit.  They usually mark the bag and that's how they know its been used twice and they don't mind at all. So really 7 plus bucks for popcorn, isn't that horrible.  Overall, pretty solid place.  They don't have IMAX or anything, but I'm always happy watching the film as it is.  The parking lot can get pretty full, but once inside it's never that crowded.  Well I guess I don't watch a lot of Friday and Saturday night films.  Most of the time we go in the afternoon on the weekends.

I don't like bashing or promoting negative reviews, but somethings I can't let go.  This was one of the worst meals I've ever had in a long time.  I had a craving for some fish and chips and ended giving this place a try, since its real close to my house.  Boy was that a mistake.  I can tell you right away what the big issue was...It's the OIL that they fry their food in.  My lady and I arrived to this place on a Saturday night.  They had all you can eat fish fry.  I ordered that for 14.95 and we split some jalapeno poppers/fried mushrooms and extra fries.  All of the food had a nasty aftertaste and it was due to the old oil that they fry the food in.  I come from a family of restaurant owners and I've worked the fryer station for years and I can tell that was the problem.  The fish and chips were terrible.  The batter was falling off from the fish, the fries were soggy and the other fried food was plain gross.  I was looking forward to a good Saturday night meal, but we left very disappointed and unhappy.  I would not recommend this place at all.  I should only give it one star, but the service was decent and the place felt clean.  Eat at your own risk.

I've eaten at this establishment several times now and it's pretty solid.  They are located in the Kierland Mall.  You generally can find parking in the area.  If I want some good Italian food reasonably priced, I think of this place.  They get pretty busy even during the week, so reservations is recommended.  The food is pretty good, I've tried the pizza, some salads, and the chefs board.  All were delicious.  If you like Italian food, I would rate it better than Maggiano's, Brio, Oregano's that are in the area.    The service is usually pretty good, I would recommend this place.

North delivers again!  Sunday is a great day to have lunch or dinner at North.  They have all day happy hour and really good food.  My girlfriend and I came here for lunch with her parents.  We ordered the chefs board and bottle of wine for 20.00 and the bruschetta.  The board was plentiful and bruschetta was on point.  The dishes we had were the Short ribs and gnocchi, the pig pizza, cheese tortellini and another pasta dish.  Everything was great and delicious.  We ended the night with tiramisu, which they do a nice touch with the chocolate beads.  Overall we had great service, and the food was outstanding.  I highly recommend this place.

1 star and they don't even deserve that.  The combination of p*ss poor customer service and mediocre food leaves me never wanting to come back.  We attended this place on July 3rd and had a reservation at 9:00.  I requested a booth a week in advance, but they couldn't even accommodate that.   Let's just get straight to the review.  Food/Service  Our waiter was no were to be seen most of the night.  We ordered a few drinks and couple of appetizers to start.  Black Truffle cheese fritters and calamari.  Both were ok, and the portions are a joke.  Most nice restaurants serve some sort of calamari dish and for what you pay here is down right insulting.  There were probably 6 to 7 pieces, seriously WTF.  For dinner we order the Filet Mignon and porterhouse steak.  My fiancee requested it medium well and I wanted my steak medium rare.  Her steak was served rare and mine was overcooked on the medium well side.  SMH.  Our sides were a potato gratin and creamed corn dish.  Once again they serve it in a little dish and the flavors were nothing special.  Our waiter said he would bring us out bread, but that never happened.  I had to request my coke to be filled up several times and had to stack the dirty plates for them to finally take it away.  Seriously, where is the customer service?  I snapped couple of pics, didn't even want to waste my time, but posting anyway.  Not the most memorable nice dinners I've had in a while.  For the food that they serve they are not an elite or top steakhouse in the valley.  They are more like a Keg's Steakhouse, Longhorns, or Flemings.  For a great steak and experience, I would recommend Mastro's, Dominick's (Scottsdale Quarter) or Donovan's.  Report Card=F!!!

I used to live in Chandler and have been eating at Rosati's for several years now.  I recently moved to Phoenix and decided to give this place a try.  It's night and day from the one in Chandler.  The place is a joke.  The pizza is expensive as it is, but it's the customer service that is a joke.  I placed an order and went in to pick it up.   I stood at the front counter for over 10 minutes before someone helped me.  It looks like the lady went to walgreens to get her cigrettes and asked what can I do for you.  I told her I placed an order and here to pick it up.  I gave her my last name and she looked it up and said I didnt place an order cause she couldnt find my last name.  I told her I spoke with a man and placed it about 30 minutes ago.  The lady then said I must of placed it at the wrong location.  She was very adamant that I placed it at the wrong store and I was 100% sure I placed at the right location.  Minutes later the delivery driver walked in and said, this must be your pizza, I thought it was for delivery.  It would make sense the lady had no clue what was going on, cause she probably was on break the entire time.  Anyways, I left and paid.  While I got home the pizza was terrible.  I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  They put pepperoni and onions.  Freaking idiots.  Regardless the pizza was terrible and service was crap.    I now go to Spinato's or Isa's.  Much better customer service and pizza.

Solid for a nice cold delicious treat.  For something a little more healthier than a Blizzard from Dairy Queen, my lady and I decided to eat more snow cones!  Usually we find ourselves wanting a cold refreshing treat in this blistering AZ summer heat, so sometimes we hit up Sonic for some slushes or Dairy Queen for a blizzard or Sundae.  Since we discovered this little gem we have been going here a lot more.  The prices are little on the high side, but if you are going to get a treat, might as well splurge a little.  For a cold refreshing treat, try a sno cone from this place.  The shaved ice is amazing.

This is my 2nd time eating at this place and both times were very good. I love pho. Something about a big bowl of pho is something that I crave from time to time. The pho is great. I think the bowls are a little small but the flavor is awesome. I have had their spring rolls which were great as well. Overall pretty solid place would recommend and go back for sure!

My go to spot for a good haircut.  I moved to Phoenix couple of years ago and tried several barbers before I finally settled in.  This place does a good job.  They have two to three barbers that work there and usually two are working.  The owner is Jonathan and he usually cuts my hair.  He does a really good job and no complaints.  Haircuts are 14.00 includes a straight razor trim, hot towel, and a brief massage.  You can't beat that.  If you want to get a good haircut at a good price, check this place out.  I highly recommend.

I love the concept and thought behind this, but ultimately I think its over rated and overpriced.  I have bought couple of arrangements in the past year and I think this time will be my last.  Recently I bought an arrangement for my fiancee.  I ordered a variety of arrangements, primarily chocolate covered strawberries, bananas, pineapple and apples.  Most of the fruit wasn't even ripe and the strawberries were GREEN!  I understand they probably don't want to use ripe fruit, cause it won't last or hold, but what's the point of tasting unripened fruit?  Sure the arrangement was beautiful but for 100.00, it better be.  So the arrangement looks good on the eyes, but tastes horrible.  That's pretty much what your getting.    Overall, I'm not too impressed.  Too expensive and the quality of the fruits, just isn't there.

Talking Stick is probably one of the better casino's in the valley, probably one of the biggest for sure.  My review is based off the casino floor and poker room.  I have personally never stayed here, or been to the pool, or some of the amenities that it has to offer.  As an Asian, gambling is in my blood.....unfortunately I get that urge to play.  My game of choice is Poker and I do like to splash around at the blackjack tables.  The casino floor it's is pretty busy and easy to get around.  They do have a good amount of tables going.  The unfortunate part is there are always big smokers, and nothing is worst, than sitting right next to a guy lighting up and blowing smoke right in the vicinity of your face.  Gross.  The good thing is inside the poker room, they have blackjack tables and are non smoking area.  That leads me to my next review.  The poker room!  This is probably the nicest thing about this casino.  They have a very large and well organized poker room.  It's not only the biggest in AZ, it's bigger than 95% of Vegas poker rooms.  They have a good amount of tables going and have daily poker tournaments.  The only down part of the poker room, is attracts some of the grimiest, sleakiest, dirtiest, rudest, and most uncivil beings in the valley.  I know what some of you are thinking?  It's a casino man, but each its own.  If you have seen what I have seen, you would agree.    Overall, pretty solid casino, especially for poker players!

This place is pretty good.  They have a pretty diverse menu and really reasonable prices.  I have never eaten there, but usually get the food to go.  They have some really good noodle dishes and really good curry.  My girlfriend loves the Thai Ice tea.  I usually go to Nee house, but have been coming here alot more now.

This place is ok, nothing special.  I have been here 4 times, 3 times for lunch and recently for dinner.  I know this place is always busy and can get pretty crowded, but I'm baffled on why.  The location is awesome, its literally across the street from the US Airways arena, and there's alot going on in this block.  The ambiance is really nice, and they have some really cool photo's around the place, but as you know what I say, It's all about the food.  The prices are pretty high and the food and portions are nothing to brag about.  We arrived on a Saturday night, it was 10 of us.  We made a reservation at 6:00 and we're seated right away.  The service was pretty poor, but since we had a big group, figured there would be more than one waiter for our table.  We ordered some appetizers which we split and my lady ordered the Chicken stuffed with crab with a side of potatoes.  I ordered the Fish and Chips.  I hear some really positive reviews about their pretzels and fondue, but I thought it was gross.  We were all talking and chatting, and by the time we dived in the fondue, it developed a thick layer on top, which you commonly see from processed cheese like Velveeta, and when I dipped the pretzel it pulled the thick layer with it. That's why its under a fire, cause soon when it gets room temperature, it hardened up.  Not impressed at all, but if you like Velveeta, you might like their fondue.  The meat and cheese board was a joke, and the hummus was bland.  The main course arrived.  Since I had a horrible experience with my last fish and Chips (The Codfather) I felt I needed something to redeem my last experience.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  I requested some tartar sauce, not this ranch cr*p they gave me and malt vinegar, but it never arrived.  So I just ate it plain. My lady ordered the Chicken stuff with crab dish.  Like I read in a previous post, I have no clue what it was stuffed with, cause it sure wasn't crab.  It was like minced crab if anything else.  Really disappointing dish, especially for that price.  Food=C.  Very mediocre.  Portions are small and very little creativity.  Appetizers were terrible and quality of the ingredients are poor.  I have no clue what that chicken was stuffed with.  If I had to bet, it was minced crab out of a can.  Terrible.  Service=D.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  We had 10 people in our group and he tried to accommodate everybody, but clearly couldn't handle the group.  I had to request my drink to be refilled several times and it took a while to get it filled.  I asked for lemons for my lady, it never arrived.  I asked for Tartar sauce and Malt Vinegar, that never arrived either.  Not impressed with The Arrogant Butcher.  I've been to several FOX concepts restaurants but this one is probably the worst.  Culinary Dropout is a close second.   I do like North a lot though.  Maybe I'll just stick to that one.  I do not recommend this place at all.

This place is pretty solid.  They have really reasonable prices which most sushi is 50% off.  It's not the very best sushi that I ever had, but it's still really good.  The problem with really good sushi is your gonna spend a lot of money for it.  If you want something that is a little less in quality, but still good, give this place a try.  My girlfriend and I usually spend 30 to 40 bucks for dinner, while a high end sushi you'll spend twice that much.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. This place is great.

I live literally 3 minutes away from this place and it's one of my go to stops for a great burger. Since they were on diners, drive in and dives, this place has gotten a lot busier. The customer service is still outstanding and the burgers are awesome.  I am a fan of this place and I recommend you try one of their speciality burgers.  They also have outstanding milk shakes. This place is also next to my favorite pizza joint, Isa's, so if you are looking for a slice of pizza, stop by there for some good pizza.

When you think of a elegant and fancy steakhouse, this is a place that definitely comes to mind.  They have it all, outstanding food, great customer service and a beautiful ambiance.  I can't give this place 5 stars, cause they were a little off on the food and various small details that they slipped up on.  This is my 2nd time eating here and both times were fantastic. We scheduled a reservation for New Year's Eve.  Our reservation was at 9:45, but we weren't seated until a little after 10:00.  The place has a very dark setting, but it is elegantly decorated and they have a nice bar and lounge setting.  It was very busy and kinda loud, but what do you expect, it was New Year's Eve.  Food-  The food was great.  We ordered a few drinks to start and nibble on their complementary bread.  We ordered the Calamari and Shrimp appetizer which was delicious.  Lightly battered, and a little kick with the jalapenos and sweet peppers.  My lady ordered the New York strip and I ordered the bone in ribeye.  We also ordered the Dominick's potatoes, sweet corn, and truffle fries.    The steaks were flavorful and good, my steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, but it did have a lot of necessary fat on it.  The sides were a little disappointing.  The Dominicks potatoes were a little mushy, the corn was a little bland, and the fries weren't hot.  Service-  The true spotlight and best thing about Dominick's was the service.  They were on point with every little request and did a great job taking care of us.  The bus boy/expeditor was assisting her and they both did a wonderful job throughout the night.  Probably some of the most attentive and best service I've ever received in a whie.  Even though the food wasn't quite perfect, the service sure made up for it.  Overall, pretty solid experience.  If you want to treat yourself and get have a great experience and good food, this place sure hits the mark.  The things that kept it from a 5 star review were the little things.  Reservations at 9:45 and were seated 15 minutes later, my steak was cooked perfectly, but had a lot of fat, also when you order a diet coke and they serve 10 ounce bottles, which adds up when you drink like 4 or 5 of them.  I hate when restaurants do that, you end up spending like 15 bucks just on diet cokes.  I know Fogo De Chao does that too. Also the sides weren't very good, maybe we should of tried something else.  I would recommend this place.

For my 100th review, I'd figure to write a review on a establishment that Phoenix is known for, and visitors from out of state would ask me....Is Pizzeria Bianco really the best pizza in the US?  For that question, I can not truly say YES or NO, but if you enjoy pizza, this place is worth a try.  For me, I think the simplicity of the pizza and the quality of the ingredients really shined through!  The tomato and mozzarella was fresh and crisp, the pizza was thin and crispy, yet had that nice chew you get from pizza that has great dough!  The sauce had a hint of sweetness and the basil on the margarita was fresh and delicious.  We ordered several pizzas to share and some salads to go along.  Overall, I was pretty impressed, we had a reservation so we didn't wait very long.  I'm not quite sure if its worth a 2 hour wait though.  I see reviews where people waited that long at times.  I would definitely come back for this pizza.  Little pricey, but nice ambiance and they have a bar next door if you want to get a drink.

After eating at the place couple of times, I'd figure to write a review on this place.  Overall this place is pretty good for breakfast.  The food was pretty good, but our service every time is pretty slow.  I usually get standard breakfast, eggs, sausage, and hashbrown.  I also have tried their biscuits and gravy.  All were pretty good.  My girlfriend is a huge fan of bacon and really enjoys the different types of bacon.  All and All, this place is pretty good.  It gets pretty busy in the morning, so expect a little wait.

Hmmm, maybe it was a off night, but I was not impressed by this place at all.  I see a lot of good and positive reviews, so I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt.  I thought the ambiance and environment was fun and inviting, but the food itself was very overrated and boring.  Maybe I'm bias cause my fiance's family owns a authentic Mexican restaurant and I've had so many great Mexican dishes recently, that this place paled in comparison.  This place is located in the corner of Greenway Hayden and Scottsdale road, right in Scottsdale Quarter.  This place is well decorated and looks like a fun place to go, but when you sample the food, the fun stops there!  The prices of this place is very expensive, especially for very simple Mexican dishes.  We stopped by on a Sunday evening, we had a pretty big group, cause it was my fiances brothers birthday.  The service was pretty good, so really no complaints, but it was the food that was the true let down.  We ordered some drinks to start out...and for appetizers we ordered some guacamole for the table.  The guacamole wasn't very tasty and for 9 bucks, you really only get a small sample.  They bring you out some chips and salsa and some sort of bean dip to nibble on while you're looking at the menu.  Since we had a big group, we all were chatting and waiting for others to arrive.  I literally looked at the menu for over 20 minutes and really nothing stood out  and it was very tough to decide.  The dinner menu was very limited, they had some dinner specials, which were very over priced and they had a taco section that they served ala carte.  I wasn't going to drop 8 to 12 bucks on one freaking taco, its principle of it.  So basically if you wanted two specialty tacos with rice and beans, it would of cost well over 20 bucks for a plate.  On the back of the menu they had dinner plates, but most dishes were over 15 and the options were very limited.  My lady ordered the three carne asada taco plate wih a side quesadilla and I ordered the pork carnitas  which was 20 bucks.  I was not impressed.  The meat was served in a little dish and the flavors were bland and the meat itself was barely warm.  It tasted like pulled pork without the smoke flavor.  Not to mention the huge glob of fat that came with it.  I seriously thought it was a joke.  I tried to add some flavors by adding hot salsa, onions and avocados, but the taste of the meat was just awful.  Overall the meal was a disaster.  I would give it a one star review, but the service was pretty good, and the ambiance was nice.   Overall, not my type of place.  Phoenix has tons of great places to try for Mexican food, but if you don't value money and want something different, give this place a try!  I would not recommend this place at all.  Maybe for happy hour and drinks, but definitely not for the food.

The best!  I've been a AZ resident for over 8 years and one thing I can say is, the poker room at Talking Stick is hands down the best in the state.  I would put that poker room against any poker room in Vegas!  It's bigger than 95% of casinos in Vegas and has a good mixture of games.  You will notice the dealers have been there along time and most of the employees are nice.  They offer free beverages likes soda, and water.  They have reasonable prices and you can eat at the poker table.    I usually go play cards, every so often.  I like the 2/3 spread games, and various limit games.  They also have daily tournaments and have a lot of other types of tournaments throughout the year.  Like the AZ State Championship next week! (Go Hesam A!, we believe!)  I do like to play blackjack from time to time.  The only drawback as I stated in a previous review is, this casino brings some of the strangest/dirtiest/grimiest  forms of lives you'll ever see.  Also since you can smoke in the casino, smokers really enjoy that.  I once sat at a blackjack table for about 30 minutes and literally witnessed a lady light up back to back to back cigarettes and it looked like her hair was on fire from all the smoke around her.  It was disgusting for sure, but luckily they do have couple of blackjack tables in the poker room area so you can avoid people like that.  Overall, if you want to come and play some poker, this place is pretty awesome.  They have low limit and high limit games, you'll find something that you like.  T.

The Best of the Best.  The Lord of the Rings.  You are not going to find a better buffet in Vegas. You wont find a better buffet anywhere in the world! The Bacchanal Buffet is it, seriously one of the best eating experiences I've ever had.  I cant think of a better buffet that I have been too, or any meal better than this.  This buffet is located in Ceaser's palace.  We checked in on a Friday night and headed straight for the buffet.  The line and wait wasn't too bad, we wanted for about 30 minutes.  It was 55 per person and for two people it came out to 120.00.  Pretty expensive, but the amount of seafood I ate, it was well worth it.  1st of all the buffet is pretty big and long.  I would encourage you to take a long before you grab a place.  There's different sections, such as Chinese, Sushi, Italian, American, etc.  The most impressive was the seafood section.  They had fresh oysters, split open crab legs, stone crab claws, shrimp, ceviche, etc.  The quality of the food was excellent.  Every tastes great and you can tell the amount of effort that put into their food.  We ate at the Belligio buffet the next day, and it didn't even come close to this buffet.  The service was top notch, I highly recommend going to this buffet if you go to Vegas.

Central Bistro, I think I'll pass next time.  This place is OK, nothing special.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast joints, so i wanted to venture out from my normal breakfast places.  So I heard about Central Bistro, so  I wanted to give it a try.  I invited my future in-laws out for brunch today.  We made reservation at 10:00 and were seat right away.  Funny thing is, my fiance requested to sit in one of the empty booths that were surrounding the restaurant, but our host said they are were all reserved.  My fiance said all of them? and she said. Yes.  By the way, after we finished our meal, ALL the booths remained empty.  Anyways, like I said it's all about the food.  I felt the meals were really overpriced and the food completely didn't deliver.  We ordered the fried chicken and waffle, Chiliquiles, Prosciutto Benedict, and standard breakfast.  The dishes were very average.  I felt the fried chicken was over fried and the waffle was bland.  The sausage gravy was lumpy and the eggs were overcooked.  My in-laws didn't eat much of their dishes, so I know they weren't that impressed.  The chiliquiles were a disgrace to the dish it tried to resemble.  In normal chiliquiles the tortilla chips should be cooked down with some sauce, but these were not.  It felt like you were eating nachos with green chili on top.  Not impressive at all. The service on the other hand was pretty decent.  I can't remember the lady's name, but she did a really good job.  Kept up with all the refills, and checked up on us from time to time.  For that,  I would step up and give it 3 stars, but honestly, the food was disappointing and there are a lot of really other good breakfast joints I would rather eat at.....It's a beautiful restaurant with disappointing food, but decent service, that's how I would sum up this place.  I would not recommend this place for breakfast, I may try their lunch or dinner, but never again for brunch.

Yummy Yummy, get in my Tummy!  This place was awesome!  So my lady and I were craving some Mexican food and were thinking about Carolina's, or Most Wanted Taco Shop. Well my brother recommended Gadzook's so we wanted to give it a try.  I'm glad we did.  This place was amazing!  We ordered some taco's and enchiladas.  We sampled the three different meats, short rib, green chile pork and chicken.  All the meats were braised and had were super flavorful.  The concept is a lot like Chipotle or Cafe Rio, but the food was a lot more tasteful.  You'll notice the difference when you sample their meats.  You order from the counter and they make your food right in front of you.  A lot of different options, with their sauces, cheeses, and salsa's.  In conclusion, if you like Chipotle, please give this place a try.  It blows Chipotle out of the water!  I'm a little upset I didn't find this place sooner.  I highly recommend and will be going back soon!

Oh yeah! Capriotti's hits the mark!  I have been eating at Capriotti's for over 4 years and it's pretty much one of my go to spots for good sandwiches that you can't get anywhere else.  I first discovered this place when I lived in Chandler.  I used to go to that location all the time and when I moved I started to come to this one on N. 16th street.  The reason why I like this place they have good size sandwiches and you can taste the difference in the quality of products.  For example, their turkey meat, isn't deli or processed, its turkey that has been slow roasting in the oven and pulled apart for your sandwich.  Everybody here has been talking about the Bobbie and yes it's a great sandwich, but the sandwich that has me coming in all the time is the..........Capastrami sandwich.  It's pastrami with coleslaw and cheese with some sort of Russian dressing.  It's amazing.  They also have really good cheese steak sandwiches.  I think this is one of the better sandwich places in all of Phoenix.  I think Capriotti's and Ike's are my two favorite sandwich joints.   Give the Capastrami, the bobbie, the italian, or the cheese steak a try.  All great sandwiches.

My aunt who frequently comes out to Vegas, recommended this place to me. I'm glad she did. Obvious the name Gordon Ramsay draws you to this establishment, but the food is actually pretty good.  I live here in Phoenix so I know good burger places like Roaring Fork, Delux, Paradise Valley burger, Rehab Burger, etc.  Gordon Ramsay BurgR would be very comparable and on that level.  We stopped by this place, its in the Planet Hollywood Casino.  We waited like 15 minutes and was seated promptly.  We ordered some truffle fries and I ordered the Farm Burger and my girlfriend ordered the Hell Kitchen burger.  Both were around 13 to 14 bucks and the fries were 10.  A little pricey, but Delux in Scottsdale, isn't much cheaper.  It's Vegas though.   One thing I did enjoy is, they have foundation drink Mountain Dew.  I don't get the chance to drink that often, but it tasted really good on that day.  I probably asked for 3 or 4 refills.  Overall the burgers were cooked to order, had a great taste and the fries were hot and flavorful.  Overall, if you want a decent burger with fries, give this place a try while you're out in Vegas.  The milk shakes did look good, but we didn't have the room to split one.  The service and food was on point, great experience, I would recommend this place to others.

Another great and solid meal at The Original Breakfast house.  Like I said I'm a big fan of breakfast joints in the valley.  I am open to try new and other places, but this place is so consistent and awesome.  They have outstanding customer service and very warming environment.  They do get pretty busy on the weekends, so expect a little wait.  It seems all good breakfast joints have some sort of wait.  My lady and I arrived at 8:00 on Sunday morning, and waited for about 15 minutes and was seated.  The service and food was all top notch.  We ordered the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and a side of hash browns, and the special which was a green chili tamale with eggs and others.  Both dishes were excellent and I would highly recommend.

First time experience and probably will be the last.  They share a space with The Yard and valet was full and there was literally no where to park.  We had to park quarter of a mile down the road and walk to this place.  I was in the mood for some Cajun/seafood, so I gave this place a try.  I read all the great reviews, so I eventually wanted to see what this place was all about.  We arrived on a Saturday night.  The place was packed!  There was a party going on in the yard,  which made parking and service terrible!  Since we didn't have a reservation, we were told our only option was the counter....even though there were couple of empty tables, but anyways...The service was really bad....it took forever to get our drinks and the appetizers we ordered, literally came at the same time as our main entree.  We wanted to order some oysters, but they ran out! then we wanted to order some calamari, and they were out of that as well.  So we settled for their corn hushpuppies and brussel; sprouts and dinner we ordered the black squid ink pasta with mussels and fish and chips.  The hushpuppies were good, but weren't a lot of them.  Especially how cheap they are to make, you would figure they would hook it up a little.  Brussell sprouts were ok, the pasta was a little bland, and the fish and chips were decent.  Really nothing positive to rave about this place.  I would say, horrible parking situation, poor service, and lackluster food would definitely keep me from coming back to this place.  I would say these Fox Concept restaurants are a true hit or miss, and this miss the mark completely.  I can't say I would recommend this place to anybody.

My girlfriend and I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon. She wanted some BBQ so we decided to give this place a try since it was close to our house.  This place is ok. Problem is, most of the best BBQ places are in the east valley. This place is very average. They offered a free breakfast with a purchase of a drink so we got that a half rack of rib platter. The breakfast was terrible. Running eggs with hard bacon and dried hash browns and toast. We didn't eat much of it.  The BBQ was ok. The ribs were extremely tender and falling off the bone but had very  little smoke flavor. I have a feeling the ribs were boiled or braised too long.  The brisket had a very weird taste and felt like it was old and reheated from the previous day.  The sides were ok. Mashed potatoes and hush puppies. The highlight of the meal was the BBQ sauce. They had two sauces. A Kansas City and spicy habanero sauce, both were good. Since moving to n Phoenix I'm still struggling to find a good BBQ joint. This place was barely better than heck yeah BBQ.

Solid Pizza.  My girlfriend and I love eating pizza.  In our neighbor there are variety of pizza places we eat from.  We sometimes get Spinato's, Rositas, or Crust.  Those have been our go to places, but sometimes we are cheap and we get a pie from Domino's, streets of New York, or Papa Johns.  I enjoy all types of pizza.  After eating at Isa's, its now my go to spot.  They have the best pizza out of all the places I have tried.  The crust is perfect and the cheese is superb.  I usually get a large pizza and save couple of slices for the next day.  I highly recommend this place.

Another solid pizza from Isa's. This place is quickly becoming my go to stop for really good pizza. As mentioned I used to go to Rosati's or spinatos a lot but haven't been there in a while. Now the prices are little pricey, you are going to spent about 20 bucks for a large pizza but I think it's worth it. The staff is pretty friendly and they have good lunch specials. The only negative about this place is their wings aren't that good. Stick with their pizza!

Outstanding!  This is hands down the best pizza joint in the valley, and it's not even close.  I love this place.  Real deal authentic NY style pizza.  I usually get a large pizza with various toppings, but this time I decided to go with the white pizza and it was amazing.  I think what separates this place from other pizza joints, is their quality ingredients.  The cheese is the best and the meats and vegetables are fresh and top quality.  I used to order Spinato's and Rosati's, but this place is so much better.  They also have a great lunch special, two pieces of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks, you can't beat that.  Since I live so close, I always order it to go and I am always impressed.  They are very friendly over the phone and when they greet you.  The employees are always smiling and you can tell they enjoy what they do.  I'm in love with this place.  If you want top notch pizza, come to Isa's, you wont be disappointed.  I highly recommend this place.  They have outstanding pizza and wonderful customer service.

I've been a frequent customer at Ike's so I figured id write a review. This place is very solid for sandwiches, what makes this place unique is the different variety of sandwiches and topping on them. I have had probably. 5 to 6 different sandwiches and the bear hug being my favorite. The staff is nice and friendly and the place is nice and clean. The only drawback is the sandwiches are a little pricey. Now granted this place blows away jimmy johns, subway, or jersey mikes but it's about double the price! Overall if you want something different, try this place cause where else can you get jalapeño poppers, chicken tenders, or mozzarella sticks on a sandwich!

My lady wanted Mexican food, so we decided to stop by the place on a Saturday night.  I have been here before for lunch and had a good experience.  So we ordered the 5 small taco plate along with a casa asada burrito (enchilada style).  The food was super good and flavorful.  Everything was delicious.  I wish we would of ordered the Nachos though.  The table next to us did, and they looked amazing.  The meats were super flavorful and the sauces were great!  You order from a counter and they make it fresh right in front of you.  The service was good and food was awesome.   I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat.  We normally go to Carolina's down the street, but glad we stopped by here.

Yum Yum!  First time eating here.  I've been to Hot and Juicy several times, and this place is pretty similar.  They do have a more diverse menu and even have BBQ on their menu.  My buddy and I had a craving for some hot and spicy seafood.  We first ordered some cajun fries, hush puppies and fried oysters.  They we ordered 2 lbs of snow crab and 2 lbs of mussels.  They had levels of spiciness 1 through 5.  We ordered 3 and it was perfectly spiced.   The food was great and flavorful.  We enjoyed this place very much.  I would recommend this place.

Another solid eating experience at the angry crab!  I was craving some good spicy seafood and this place hit the spot.  I took my lady here on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy but only needed to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The service was great, our waiter checked up on us a lot, which was great, but I'm sure every time he came, he saw me smash the crab legs that I ordered!  I don't play around at this place.  The service was awesome.  We ordered some hush puppies and cajun fries.  Also 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 lbs of mussels and 1 lb of shrimp!  This time I ordered the trifecta but only level 2 spice!  Once again another solid meal.  I give it 5 stars!  The place is loud, its messy, but its good ole eating.  My type of style.  I would gladly drop 100 or so on this place, then some BS FOX concept restaurants. (Arrogant Butcher)

I've been to Lo-Lo's couple of times now and I really don't understand the big fuss is about.  I think the food here is very average.  The chicken is ok, I personally think Popeyes Chicken is better and the waffles are plain waffles, something that you can get in any breakfast place.  The catfish was decent, but nothing to rave about.  One thing I will say is the sides are really good.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were flavorful and delicious, only drawback is, its served in a very small bowl, so you don't get much besides couple of bites.  The corn bread was good, but how could it not be, there was about a 1/4 lb of butter sitting on top of it.  One thing that did irk me was, I felt like they wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  It was a little busy and I understand they want to turn tables, but we got our check literally a minute after we got our food.  I noticed the waiter would walk by and look at the check, and hope we were ready to pay, but since we weren't even finished with our meal, I refused to give them my debit card.  I had to ask several times to get my drink refilled and the 2nd time I asked for a refill, they put it in a go to cup for me as if they were ready for me to take it to go.  It's seriously uncalled for.  I'm not a fan of this place, but fortunately for them, my girl really likes this place.  I bet if more places served Chicken and waffles, it would generate more competition, and I'm sure this place wouldnt be as busy, cause the food is really nothing special.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I may officially found my new go to spot for EXCELLENT chicken wings!  Now that football season is upon us, snacks, finger foods, and dips are my pleasure especially watching hours of exciting football on TV.  Everyone knows I enjoy wings, and its pretty much my go to snack.  I have tried countless places for this delicious hand held snack and I am mostly disappointed that I an impressed.  First of all, the best chicken wings are deep fried, NOT baked.  I hate baked wings, when the skin is loose and fatty.  Fried is where its at!  ATL Wings, congratulations , you have entered my top 3 go to wing places in the valley.  They are in discussion with Zipps, their golden wings, and Wings Express in Mesa.  They have excellent sauces and the wings are big and meaty.  My lady ordered the boneless wings and fries, both were very good.  I know they have 18 different sauces and flavor, but as a traditionalist, I stuck with the buffalo, medium, extra saucy.  Some of the best wings I'd had.  Its a little far from me, but I am willing again to travel the great distance to sample them again.  I highly recommend their wings!

My 2nd week in a row and first time was no fluke.  I tried them for the first time last week and I was even more impressed this time. They have the best chicken wings in town!  Its a bold statement, cause I consider myself a Chicken wing eating expert!  I've sampled wings from all across the US and this place is one of my favorite ever, let alone in Phoenix.  They do it right.  It's a wing place, everything else is secondary.  This time around I ordered the 36 piece wings, 18 buffalo medium, extra saucy and I had 9 ATL style and 9 honey habanaro.  The wings were big, meaty and very flavorful.  Also ordered some fries ATL style and came with a free drink.  I invited couple of buddies over for the games yesterday and they were thoroughly impressed as well.  It was a little drive for me, but its well worth it.    Best Wings in Phoenix area-  I promise you that!

Miracle Mile!  This is the first time I've been here since they moved to this location.  I have been going to the old location when I first moved to the valley.  The space is a lot smaller, but the look and the feel are just the same.  It's cafeteria style and we were able to get a table.   I've never been here for dinner, but have eaten here for lunch plenty of times.  Even though I always want to try something different, I always go to..... my go to sandwich.  I usually get the straw or just pastrami with sauerkraut.  I ordered the straw and mac and cheese.  The sandwich wasn't as big as I remembered but the mac and cheese was on point!  The food was good and probably one of the better delicatessen's in the valley.  I would recommend for a good lunch, but expect to spend 10 to 15 including drink.

This place is located off Tatum and Bell.  I drive by this place almost everyday.  I know couple of years ago this place was a Mexican joint and recently it was a Native New Yorker.  The building is pretty big and location is great, so I am confused why previous businesses have failed.  So when this place opened, I was skeptical on how it would do or even last.  Well I saw a great deal on Groupon for 18.00 bucks you get 30.00 dollars worth of food.  So I told my fiancee, lets give this place a try........boy I am glad i did!  This place was awesome.  They have a great ambiance and the staff was extremely friendly.  Most importantly the food was delicious!  My fiancee and I ordered the two egg plate, with pancakes and I ordered the country fried steak with eggs.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  Our waiter checked on us several times and the owner or manager even stopped by.  The service was outstanding.  If the food was just average, I would go back again, cause they were friendly and very inviting.  My lady and I are huge breakfast fans, we like to go out on the weekends and enjoy ourselves.  We normally go to the Oink Cafe, 40th Street Cafe, The Original Breakfast House, Matt's big breakfast and The Perk Eatery. I can proudly say we will be adding The Haymaker to the rotation.  Give this place a try, you wont be disappointed.

I wasn't really sure of how this experience was going to go, but surprisingly it was pretty fun and I love the interaction between our group.  So we arrived on a Saturday night.  Without ruining or giving anything away, but you are locked in a room and you must solve the puzzle.  There are different themes for the different rooms.  I felt it was challenging and we really had a good time.  I would recommend for a group of friends that like to solve things.
