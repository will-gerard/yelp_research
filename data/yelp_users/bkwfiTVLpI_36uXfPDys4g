Let me first say that I've been here for car washes a handful of times over the last year or so. Typically I wash my car but like to save some time when possible.    My most recent visit though has given credence to some suspicions and doubts I had about Francis and Sons.  Many feel unsafe about leaving items in their car without locking it up in the glove compartment because of the possible theft.  However, it is far worse to be stolen from with lies said to your face. I have some scratches on my car, from parking lots I assume, and I was told the detail would remove them and have the car looking like new. For $120 I thought I'd treat my car, she's suffered enough, and get her scratches removed and then get a nice wash/wax/shine.  After about an hour I noticed the guy buffing the car had broken something on my rear hatch (hatchback) and then another came as they fumbled around trying to fix something (handle/button/insignia I didn't know) but I figured I'd get an apology and they'd inform me once I went over when they had finished.  Nope....  Not only did they fail to remove any...I repeat...ANY scratches from the car. They simply placed the button (that opens the hatch) in it's place in the hopes that I wouldn't notice until I drove away and have it fall off never to be seen again.  The managing person there didn't even make any attempt to better the situation and the guy who sold me the detail said nothing about the obvious little scratches that remained. They offered nothing when told about it...sad.  I am easy to please, truthfully I am, but shadiness, slyness and dishonesty are things that truly annoy and frustrate me like nothing else.     If you want good HONEST service go somewhere else. I'll try Los Olivos, Clean Freak or Dannys from now on.

Found the Art of Touch last year through a Living Social/Groupon type deal and being a sports oriented person (Football through college and currently Olympic LIfting/Gymnastics) I had only had success with about 2 or 3 masseuses. I was pleased to have a really good massage. "C" was not shy about getting tough with my IT bands, shoulders ,etc. I've been back 3 times and try to get back when I can.  I find it to be affordable sports therapy and a good 45-60min massage.  Any ex-athletes? I recommend!

A good friend told me about the great music and atmosphere at Timo and since it's about 5 min away I figured I'd take my bros and family to check it out.   This rating is for the food and service only - I  went around 4 on a Saturday, wasn't exactly jumping with people but it did make the service that much better :)  Order the Tiger Woods (a twist on the Arnie Palmer) which is lemondae with hibiscus tea (good for you "Jamaica" lovers) The Smoked salmon on corn cakes, crab cakes and the kalamari and mussels ceviche. ALL GOOD! Solid food and very fresh. I'm not much for the appeal or the presentation - just taste and quantity.- but the presentation was real nice and satisfied the eyes.    My family had grilled chicken salads, different tapas like lamb chops and one with olives. Everyone liked their food.   I would not come here if you're looking to feed the beast. But if you want to try some fresh, tasty, different foods then this will do.  I'm looking forward to eating here when it's busy and lively.  http://www.zagat.com/r/timo-sunny-isles-beach/menu  here is their menu
