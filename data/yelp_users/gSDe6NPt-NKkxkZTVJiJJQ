Although I personally had a decent experience and liked the way my nails turned out. I was SUPER disappointed that ALL 9 of my bridesmaids walked out with a terrible experience. I didn't know until after I was finished because ,although we had reservations, we were all separated throughout the shop. I didn't get to sit with any of my bridesmaids the whole time which defeats the purpose of us all going out together.  Their nail color, which was supposed to be black, was navy blue in regular daylight.  One of my bridesmaids got forgetten and they didn't even get to her nails bc although they said "I'll be back" they never returned.  Her pedicure water was cold and the massage chair didn't even work.  We expressed our concerns & got no sympathy. No discount. They literally didn't care that my bridesmaids left with jacked up nails, wrong nails color and a terrible experience.
