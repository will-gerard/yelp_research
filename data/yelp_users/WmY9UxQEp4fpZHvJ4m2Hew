Oh Green, how do I love thee....so much that I fantasize about salads and tsoynamis.  I've been to both the Tempe and Phoenix locations, including the cafe/bakery/sister restaurant, Nami. I am a 23 year vegetarian,  part time vegan. My SO is a Nebraska bred, meat and potatoes kinda guy. We both love Green. I'm convinced,  if you don't like Green, there's something broken in your mouth...now the important stuff... Ambience. ...hip, funky, casual, sometimes hectic...and all in a good way. Not intimidating.  No too hippy dippy. Just clean, bright, and creative. There's tons of seating inside and at the Tempe location,  a patio. The staff are 99% of the time cheerful and friendly...on one occasion we got a surly server/cashier but it wasn't bad enough to ruin our visit.  FOOOOOOOD... Well where to start..i order the Ranchero salad every time I eat here. Tender, mixed baby greens, crunchy tortilla strips, carrot shreds, creamy ranch and Green's yummy yummy barbecue "wings"...it's perfect. Speaking of wings...these are amazing. Meaty texture, zesty sauce and the cucumber ranch and veg that accompany it are refreshing and delicious.  This is my guy's go to. With the thyme fries...that are so crispy.... The perfect fry. We had the fries with chili once and unfortunately/fortunately we decided it wasn't for us and that I make a far meaner, and superior veggie chili. Moving on....on my very first visit I tried the Kung pao with mock chicken noodle bowl and was not a fan. Watery, too sweet, too salty yet bland sauce, slightly too al dente noodles...it just wasn't what I expected.  We also split a  Wendy's pickle. It's a mock fried chicken cutlet with pickle and spicy vegan mayo. It was warm and soft and tastes so much like chicken I was slightly scared it was real..on subsequent visits, we tried the 'thee argentine poboy"...grilled mock steak and caramelized peppers and onions with mayo and a spicy sauce. The steak had crispy bits, tender bits and was so flavorful. I would've loved more vegetables. ..there were 2 pieces of pepper on the whole sandwich. .but the part that stands out the most, oddly enough was...the bun. The fluffiest, most perfect bun ever. I want every sandwich I eat to be on that bun. We also ate the BBBQ bacon burger. Veggie patty, portabella cap, bacon, bbq sauce,  mushrooms onions and mayo. This burger was so rich and delicious and big.  We split it and I couldn't finish my half. Green also offers daily, off - menu, specials. We got a Carne asada nachos, which were ok. Tasty, but not enough carne, and too many dry chips. The most recent special I tried was a rueben sandwich.  The sandwich was huge! Tons of Seiten steak, thousand island, vegan cheese and sauerkraut on rye. It came with fries, (you can get fruit, fries, coleslaw). Very tasty. My only beef is with the price tag. Both specials I tried were $12 which is $3+ more than the regular menu  items. Which isn't a lot by any means...but the specials i tried weren't Green's best dishes..  At Green you can get water, or one of their delicious, refreshing drinks...lime, berry lemonade, iced tea, and vimto. I have no idea what vimto is..maybe it's vitmo..anyway..i don't know what it is, but I know it's red, mildly sweet and delicious. There's also some bottled kombucha, boxed water, other bottled juices as well as beer! on tap. Local favorites from 4 peaks brewery and more. And super reasonably priced. . $3 for a kiltlifter.    If by some chance you have any room left, do yourself a favor and get dessert. The s'mores tsoynami is so good. Creamy soft serve, chocolate, graham crumbs and rice fluff...soo goey. Ive had a lemon ginger tsoynami as well and it was scrumptious. You can buy pastries and other goodies too including take and bake cookies. And the desserts are reasonably priced too. Seriously. . $4.50 for a huge tsoynami.  Suck it DQ.    I almost forgot! Nami does sunday brunch and Monday through Friday breakfast and Green frequently holds special dinners...a carnivore conversion dinner, holiday meals..and Green and Nami cater.     I also wanted to mention a few details...   Ordering is done at a counter. You're given a number and a server brings you your food. You clear your own table. There are condiments like hot sauce and tamari available. The kitchen tries to use organic whenever possible.  Long review short..i love Green.  It's delicious, vegan comfort food. Not even "comfort food". It's the food you, as a vegetarian,  dream about finding on the menu at a restaurant. No more crappy side salad and fries! No more frozen, did they cook this on the meat grill, veggie burgers! Enough of me typing...You should just go and love it too.

Coyote coffee is everything you could want in a coffee shop..quiet, quaint, nicely and comfortably furnished with delicious coffee and great staff. Every time I've gone, the coffee is perfect.  The staff I've been served by have all been friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. There's no confusing sizes in words you're embarrassed to say, no crazy specialty drinks..just delicious coffeehouse drinks and sweets. They have a punch card program towards free drinks and a "pay it forward" board, where you can buy a friend, employee, or stranger a drink. They also sell and service espresso machines, if youre so inclined..the equipment part of the shop reminds me of a fine cigar shop..i also appreciate that when I've gone in to look at the equipment, no one hovered or scolded me for playing around with it...which i did delicately..as most machines start at $200... Coyote coffee is at the end of a strip mall that has Munch-a-mania, a police supply shop and some other stores..it has big banners that you can't miss.. and you shouldn't. ..this local business deserves our business.

My kids and I live across the street from Geno's and were excited to go after they opened.  Our first visit was ok. Staff was nice.  Food mediocre.  Restaurant clean.  We went back for our second visit about 6 weeks later.  We ordered a Greek salad,  Greek fries,  3 slices,  a burger, a cheesesteak, and mozzarella sticks.  The salad was served almost immediately.  Then the wait began.  For 30 minutes we sat and watched as the staff cut lettuce, drank soda and joked around. We finally get the pizza.  3 slices that had very obviously been sitting for hours. To spruce them up the "cook" sprinkled a few strands of fresher cheese over top and reheated. The slices were so thin and wet..wet! You couldn't even pick it up. The cheese sticks were next. They were piping hot.. with frozen marinara. Actually frozen. I asked if there was any warm sauce and was told no. In a pizza place. The cheesesteak and Greek fries were next. Greasy yet dry, at the same time. Stale roll. My daughter had to drench it in ketchup to get down a few bites . the fries were "baked".. they were dry, rock hard and stuck to their baking pan. Almost no toppings that make them "Greek".  After, another 15 minutes the burger came out but sat behind the counter until my 16 year old got up and asked for her sister's food. My son and I couldn't eat the pizza. I went up to the counter.  I told the cashier that the pizza was very disgusting, obviously old and that I wanted a refund.  She acted like I raped her favorite stuffed animal. She disappeared, and came back almost 10 minutes later offering, not a refund but a free pizza. We took the pizza and my kids said school pizza is better. School pizza!!!!! If the HORRIBLE crap they call food isn't enough of a reason to deter you from eating at Geno's,  perhaps the hour+ wait, and careless staff will.
