I had my wedding and reception here in 2012. We were married a few days before Christmas and the staff was so accommodating considering it was holiday time. It was beautifully decorated and dimly lit in the outdoor area with white lights strung throughout. The food was amazing and easily the best I've ever had at a wedding and luckily it was mine! It was served buffet style and there was a ton of food for all the guests. They helped make this a special night for my husband and I. I highly recommend this place for any catered event.

This place is so cool, I could easily spend my entire day on the third floor playing in the weather simulator. I love that they host different exhibits so there's always something new to try. My daughter loves the water area outside and the kid zone towards the back of the first floor. They have a great deal for season passes so this is an excellent air conditioned space to come and enjoy with the family.

The west entry has you walking through the kitchen and watching all the food being made, which is a really cool experience. It feels very cheers-like and welcoming. The front store is host to a wide array of niknaks and goodies. The menu is HUGE with salads, sandwiches, pizza, sushi, dessert and a slew of other goodies. There is literally something for everyone. I am a huge fan of their premade salads and if this place were closer I could easily pop in everyday for one. One downfall is the parking, it is a bit tight and if you go during a busy time you may have to valet or park further down the street and walk. All in all this place is an easy favorite.

We had a few bad experiences with different pediatric offices around the valley before discovering and falling in love with this office. Dr Namjoshi is amazing. He is very open to what you want as a parent. He doesn't push vaccines and leaves it up to the parent to choose what and if they want to.  Several times we needed to make last minute appointments and they were always able to get us in that same day no problem.  I would highly reccomend this office.

My family and I love Mexican food. If and when we eat out its almost always Mexican. We love coming to Macayos for so many reasons. They have a ton of booths, family friendly, great wait staff, super quick service and we almost never have to wait longer than 5-10 minutes for a table. There's a lot is chain type Mexican places in the arrowhead area and they are definitely not all created equal. Macayos is most definitely the best!

This zoo is by far better than the Phoenix Zoo. The exhibits are more "authentic" for the animals, and that is a draw in itself. The new rides are a great addition but can get costly if you have multiple people in your party. The aquarium is just depressing. The white alligator makes me want to cry in his sad little plastic enclosure. For how costly this place is they should have paved walkways and more humane enclosures for the animals. Overall it's an okay place to spend a winter day but I'd rather save my money and go to Disneyland for the price.

I called one morning because my hands were swollen and I was wanting to know if they could cut and repair a ring. The man on the phone was very friendly and I was there within 10 minutes. The removal of the ring was quick, painless, and free! I did have them repair the ring for me at a very reasonable price and they did a wonderful job. The ring not only was fixed in less than 24 hours, but it looked brand new. I would definitely return!

I use to really enjoy coming here due to the variety of food on the menu. It's never really been amazing but there's a ton of choices and the cheesecake is amazing. The last time I came here I ordered a piece of banana cheesecake. It tasted slightly off but still good so I assumed it was just me and ate a few bites of it. Later that night I was up and sick from the bad cheesecake I consumed earlier. After that experience I will never come here again.

This is by far the best place I've had Greek in the valley. The serving sizes are huge, the veggies are fresh, and the meat is tender. I order take out from here all the time and I have never had to wait for my food when I get there. There's been a couple occasions with a slightly rude person on the phone or I end up missing a salad or side item in my take out order. However, when the food is as good as it is everything else gets overlooked. I highly recommend giving this place a try but for the best experience I would dine-in.

You would think in this shopping center that Mr Goodcents wouldn't have a chance. This shopping center is where businesses go to die. However, Mr Goodcents has stood the test of time and thankfully they are still there! The staff is super friendly and the same guys have been there for a while so the turn over rate can't be too high. The sandwiches are always fresh and I never have to wait long. I love this place!

This Frys is in desperate need of a renovation. The lighting is dark, the aisles are narrow, and what's worse the produce is terrible. I would love to see this place updated because it is so convenient for my family. In the meantime we travel to a further location to get the quality this locations lacks.

The pizza here is great. It's well made and good quality. Delivery does take a bit longer than other places and the prices are a higher, but it's easily one of the better places around. The boneless wings are my favorite item on the menu. The meat is good quality and they are always super soft and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside just like it should be. The large pizza is huge and feeds my family of four no problem and always has some left over. They seem to have a higher turn over rate then other smaller pizza places but I've never had any complaints about the staff. Overall a good place to eat.

Cutest salon I've been to. The decor is tasteful and funky and the front desk girls are really friendly. I see Chanel and she does a wonderful job both with cuts and color. Their really aren't a lot of options in the area for salons so it's pretty awesome that there is a great salon so far north. Don't bother going to great clips, shell out the extra 15 bucks for a cut and go somewhere you'll leave happy!

I don't understand where all these 3,4,&5 star reviewers ate because it couldn't possibly be the same place I ate. I came here on a Saturday morning and they were moderately busy. The wait wasn't to bad and we were seated within 10 minutes. The wait staff was terrible. The entire time we were there she checked on us one time after the initial order was placed. Actually we had a bus boy bring us all the additional items we needed. Every time I looked around for our waitress she was just standing in the corner. Her attitude was terrible. Aside from the bad service the food was mediocre. I didn't find out until 3 hours later but it also made me sick. Right before we left we went to the bathroom and there was feces smeared all over one of the toilets and the floor. If I would have seen this before I would have left immediately. I will never return to this establishment.

Yen is the best, don't bother eating sushi elsewhere. I've tried, and nothing compares to yen. The staff here are friendly and the food is wonderful, what more could you want!  My husband is a professional deep sea fisherman and before that a crabber. So I would say he knows a thing or two about good fresh fish. I took him here dragging his feet because he doesn't like eating sea food anywhere that's not coastal. He was impressed. Actually the words that came out of his mouth were "this is some of the best crab I've ever had". To eat some of the best crab one has ever had when you've had ALOT says something. This place is definitely worth a try if you haven't already. Make sure you get here in off hours before lunch or dinner because it is a very small restaurant.

I have no clue why anyone would rate lady luck less than five stars. All the guys that work here are friendly and welcoming. I've been tattooed by a lot of artists in a lot of shops and I always felt very comfortable coming into Lady Luck. Tony is an amazing artist and an all around nice guy. He took an idea I had and made it into something incredible. I have and will continue to refer people to this shop.

After doing tons of Yelp searching a group of friends and I decided to try out Grimaldi's for our monthly ladies dinner. I was really looking forward to it since the reviews were so good. First impression wasn't great, our server was probably one of the rudest servers I've ever had. She had a terrible attitude and seemed to overall hate her job. We were all really polite to her so I'm not really sure why she was so grouchy. On to the food, it was OKAY. Most definitely not anywhere near the best pizza I've ever had but maybe a slight improvement over dominos or Pizza Hut. It was essentially tasteless. There was little seasoning and almost no flavor. I think if I had a slice of cheese instead of the supreme I ordered it would have been even worse, the toppings definitely masked the blandness. Lastly it was super expensive. For any good topping add on its an additional $2-$7. Overall the service was bad and the pizza was mediocre.

Go see B, she is such a nice lady and is the best nail tech I've ever met. My nails always look wonderful. Prices are comparable to most salons but I appreciate being able to understand what they are talking about. I went here over other places because of the yelp reviews. So thank you yelpers!

I looove this barrrr, it's my kinda place... Seriously tho, I love this bar. The bartenders are wonderful. I've spent many a night in a dive bar and these bartenders are just the best. By your second visit they'll remember your drink, by your third or fourth your name, by visit five your best friends. It is a dive however, so don't walk in expecting 5 star accommodations. Bathrooms are old and a little gross, some of the regulars are a bit sketchy but if you enjoy a good jukebox, friendly faces, cheap drinks, karaoke and live music this place is sure to impress.

I can't even consider in and out to be fast food, more like an awesome burger place that just so happens to have a drive thru and speedy turn out time. The staff is always friendly, I love that I can watch them make my food = no secrets or fallen patties ending up on my burger. My family visits in and out on average once a week and we have never had a rude employee, wrong order or any other occurrence that would be normal at any other fast food place.

The food is excellent and it's one of few restaurants I feel comfortable enough with the quality of food to feed to my child. Wait is never long to get seated and food is always great. My only complaint is that sometimes the staff seem rushed (which is odd because there are always 2 or 3 staff members just standing around) so I can end up waiting longer than most places for my check, food or drink refill.  Overall food rating would be 5 stars Overall service rating would be 3 stars

I don't really know what to consider this place, not quite a sit down but not really fast food either. I should say I have never actually dined in we have always ordered take out but I've never seen any table service the handful of times I've been in. The food here is good, simple and fresh. However one major suggestion if your ordering take out, always check your boxes before you leave. I learned the hard way after having my order messed up 3 out of 4 times. Other than that it's good food with reasonable prices.

Pita jungle is pita jungle is pita jungle. They're all the same, No matter which one you go to. They all have the awkward hipster  staff members and the food is the same at each one. Beyond that the food is always good and I appreciate they're being a healthy alternative on this side of town.

I almost always pick pita jungle when it's my turn to pick. However, the last visit to this location will indeed be my last. The waiters here are always very friendly so service is not the issue. The BIG BLACK HAIRS, yes plural, were my issue. I ordered the gyro which I almost always do and to my surprise when I got halfway through I had something snag in my mouth...... Talk about disgusting. I looked and noticed NO ONE was wearing a hair net. Disgusting!!! So unless sanitary practices don't matter to you I would highly suggest avoiding this place.

Orange chicken is delicious! Seriously... Get the orange chicken. I have tried other things on the menu and have never been disappointed. The staff are really friendly which is a nice change compared to other places in the anthem/north phoenix area. If your looking for good take out this is the best place around.

In Arizona there should more places that offer indoor playing options. It's nice to have a local place to take the kids on a hot day to play. I have been here several times and never purchased a drink because I'm weary of coffee from places that don't strictly sell coffee. The last time we were here I decided to give it a go and try the white mocha. It was surprisingly really good! Overall this place is great. It's only downfall is how busy it gets. There should really be a limit to how many children they allow in there at one time, and if they do already it's too high. A few times it's been so packed that my daughter couldn't really play. So now to avoid over crowding we only come here right when they open.

I have been to a handful of urgent cares around the valley and this is by far the nicest. The waiting room is clean and organized, the staff were friendly and the wait time was short. I checked in online before going and arrived 15 minutes before my check in time to finish paperwork. When all was said and done I was there less than 45 minutes. I have been to other urgent cares that offer the check in amenity and I still end up waiting over an hour just to get in.  The only complaint I have about this place is, it was hot. Since it's 110+ out I enjoy a little ac and I felt like they could definitely turn it down at least 10 degrees before it would be considered comfortable.

We walked in and were surprised at how tiny the restaurant was and how many people were standing and waiting in line. We were told it would be a 5 min wait, 5 min came and went and after 15 we almost left and went next door, so happy we didn't! Once we sat down from the time the waitress took our order to the food to our table was maybe 5 min. The food was amazing, honestly some of the best food I've ever had. We ordered a meat lovers omelet with potatoes, a BLT and an order of pancakes. We have had these dozens of other times at other restaurants and had satisfactory meals, but this place is next level good. We will most definitely be returning (as frequently as possible!) and will be more much patient while waiting to be seated knowing what's coming!

By far the least annoying DB I have been to. I used to have a huge love hate with DB, I mean the coffee is amazing but the workers are way too much for my taste. It's 6 am, I'm tired and on my way to work, I don't need to be serenaded to whatever top 20 stuff they're blaring. However, I do appreciate friendly and prompt service and the people at this location do just that. Not too much, friendly but not enough to make me uncomfortable. If I had the choice between Starbucks a mile away or DB 5 miles away, I would definitely suck it up and drive a little farther.

I've been to this restaurant several times and never been disappointed with the food or service. The girls that work here have always been nice and accommodating. I get the same meal every time I come, the chicken wrap with fries and a pizza cookie. It always tastes great and never disappoints. My only complaint is how HOT it is in there. I don't know if the ac isn't working well or they're just cheap but it's reason enough for me to not come here unless it's cooler outside.

BACON...BREAKFAST...BURRITO  The best I've ever had and nothing else can come close. It's a little pricey compared to similar style establishments but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks and have quality food. An easy favorite.

Great workout, technology is motivating, customer service is terrible. When I signed up for my intro class I knew right away I wanted in. Burning 500+ calories in an hour sounded amazing. I researched their website before going in and I'm several spots on the site it says "our flexible plans have no contract". After my initial workout I signed up and the girl signing me up just pointed where to sign saying it was just the privacy information and what not. Anyway I tried the gym for two weeks but it was increasingly hard for me to attend. I have two children, one of which has special needs, and I just didn't have the availability to attend the limited class times. I called after two weeks into my membership to tell them I wasn't wanting to continue. It wasn't until that point that I was told about the 30 day cancellation policy. I requested speaking to a manger (Megan I think) and she never returned my calls. Finally I got her on my 3rd or 4th attempt and she essentially said I was SOL but she would drop my membership to the lowest amount ($55) after I explained over and over the situation and false advertising. When I went in to sign the cancellation forms the girl at the front desk was confused so I asked to see the manager. She walks in her office and comes back and says "she's busy but we figured it out". The manager NEVER came to talk to me. I went to my car and was getting my daughter settled only to see the manager walk in the main area within seconds of me leaving. She was avoiding me, this alone shows me how terrible this place is run if she won't even meet with a customer and instead makes he poor girl at the front who probably makes minimum wage deal with it. A week later my card was charged twice the amount they said ($110). I called and they said there was no more discounting they could do and that was that. At this point I was too tired and annoyed to fight with her any further. I was super bummed this place has such terrible business practices because I planned on rejoining after summer when my daughter was in school. All in all the workouts are great but the staff is TERRIBLE and the business is poorly ran.

First thing, before I get to the donuts, the people that work here are amazing! I put in an order over the phone and when I arrived to pick it up all three people working said hello and were all smiles. Upon paying I left what I thought to be a couple dollars in the tip jar and went on my way. 10 minutes later I received a phone call and the woman working told me there was a twenty hidden behind a one and she figured that it was an accident that I left it. To be honest I had no clue I even had a 20$ in my wallet, she could have kept it and I would have never known. But she didn't. That is extremely honest and just shows how great their customer service is.   Now to the donuts, they are so yummy. I picked up a dozen for a play date and all the moms and kids loved them. We got the s'mores, maple bacon, maple and white icing. All of them were very fresh tasting. I would definitely reccomend this place!

There is literally not a single bad thing I could say about this office. My OB is Dr Andrew Carter, after going through 5 (yes 5, I interviewed OBs like Katherine Hiegle) I picked Dr Carter. Every time I was in the office his front desk girls greeted me with smiles on their faces. His assistant is so prompt with her return calls and also a very nice lady. Dr Carter remembers (or atleast makes an effort) majority of the things I tell him, and most importantly I never felt rushed or was made to feel stupid for my plethora of questions about pregnancy. I will continue to refer people to this office and don't plan on changing OBs as long as Dr Carter is practicing.

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza cookie pie, that's amore! Really, what other reason is there to come here if not for the pizza cookie. It's the size of an adults head with gooey chocolate, soft cookie dough center, crispy edges, 3 giant piles of delicious vanilla ice cream........ I've lost my train of thought.....  Aside from the amazing cookies, the food is good all around. There's a reason this place is PACKED at all times. The boom dip is a personal favorite along with the thin crust pizza. The portions are huge and it is so worth the wait!

I am usually completely biased when it comes to sushi.  I refuse to eat anywhere other than my favorite place. However, one night I was bribed into trying Osaka and was pleasantly surprised. Their fish was very fresh tasting, service was good, atmosphere was fun. I had two rolls, a phili and a spicy tuna. The amount of food you get for the price is very reasonable. My friend had chicken and fried rice and it was by far the best fried rice I had ever tasted. My only complaint was that the sushi wasn't as cold as I would have liked. If it's a hot roll it should be warm or hot, if it's a cold roll it should be cold, mine was kinda room temp. Edible and enjoyable but not as much as it could have been. Overall I would definitely try it again and suggest this place!

I really wanted this place to succeed. It was nice having sushi in the arrowhead area. However, the last two times I've visited the service was TERRIBLE. Half my order was missing, when I finally flagged down a waitress she was essentially useless and didn't understand that my order was messed up. We used to come here weekly but after my last few experiences we will not be returning.

I really love this nail salon. When I went here for the first time the owner was working the front desk and he was incredibly friendly. They always do an amazing job on pedicures and I don't feel rushed. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review is because the one time I wanted to try out a manicure I left with 3 cuts in my fingers from the tech cutting too deep. I will most definitely continue coming here for pedicures but will likely go elsewhere for a mani.

This is one of my favorite locations. The drinks are always made perfectly and the staff is incredible. My only complaint is the parking lot. It is so tiny and the line is so long. If you park and go in you will likely be closed in by the line that wraps around the building. However, it doesn't stop me from going everyday!

I love this theatre! The full reclining seats are the major draw to this place. I've been going to AMC 14 since it opened. It used to be a really popular theatre but in the last 10 years it just wasn't as nice anymore. I was anticipating it closing down but after the re-model this theatre is the best one on the west side. I noticed at my last movie they even added a small bar next to the food stand. Definitely worth the slightly higher ticket price!

I absolutely love this place! The gym equipment is amazing for all kids, autistic or not. I love having a place that I can bring my daughter and just let her run free without worrying about what other people are saying. We have been here several times and she always wants to stay longer. My only complaint is we came here in a Saturday and there was a sign out front that said "PRIVATE PARTY 11:30-3:30". At the time it was 10:15 so I was thinking "great we have an hour!" So we brought my daughter inside and were told by the couple working the front that the sign was written incorrectly and should have said "private party, open gym 11:30-3:30". When my daughter was told we had to come back she had a huge meltdown and cried for upwards of an hour until we came back at 11:30. The couple was very apologetic and felt horrible but it was still disappointing to see my daughter so upset. Aside from that this place is great and we now know next time to call ahead.

It seems to be a recurring trend with Starbucks located inside of Albertsons being below standard. The one inside Frys and Safeway a few miles north are great.  We rarely frequent this location since it seems almost every time we go the coffee tastes burnt or stale. If I'm paying 5$ for coffee I am really expecting the best possible quality. The young kids that work here are all very friendly and seem to always be working (cleaning, stocking etc). I just want to be clear that this review is strictly product based and not employee based. I don't know if they aren't stocked as frequently as other Starbucks or what the deal is but they seem to be out of common orders a lot.   This location is very convenient being off the 17 and carefree highway. It's unfortunate that they will most likely never do anything to improve this location as I'm sure they get a lot of traffic from people traveling. That being said, if they made a few minor improvements I'm sure more people from the surrounding neighborhoods would visit this location instead of the other three Starbucks just a few miles north.
