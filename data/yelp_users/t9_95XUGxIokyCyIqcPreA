This place is awesome. The kids and I go here every time we visit Arizona which is about twice a year. I normally get a coupon for BOGO through Entertainment.com. Admission is worth the price however. But I'm cheap and all about coupons.  Everything is hands on. The facility is extremely clean and user-friendly. You can literally spend hours in here so give yourself some time, pack a snack for the kiddies, and enjoy all the rooms and different levels of the center. It's a great place for kids of all ages. And us big kids too.  Parking can be confusing but if you're an out of town guest like us, just ask for directions and people are more than happy to assist you.

This place is beautiful. We had a BOGO coupon, and I had my student ID so we saved about $36. The bathrooms are clean and the water fountains are filtered with cold water. Makes walking around on a hot day much more enjoyable.   If you have the opportunity to come later in the day I would recommend it. They have lights throughout the grounds and it's really fun for the kids to see.  It's not a very big garden, but it was fun to sit on the lounge chairs by the water foutains and just relax. Before we knew it, 30 mins had passed by.  They offer a variety of classes for an additional fee. I'm sure it would be fun to go to.   I believe it's free on the second Tuesday of every month, so it's a great opportunity to take the kids when they get of of school.

I found this place through the yelp app while staying at the Squaw Peak Hilton over Memorial Weekend. I ordered a pizza from them about 10 minutes before closing. They told us it would take 15-20 mins. It was less than that. I bought a medium cheese pizza for the kids, and ordered a large half "Works" and half "Philly" pizza. We were charged $1 extra for having two sauces. But that was cool because we got to try more than one pizza.  Really small hole in the wall. They were very unorganized on the phone I will admit. I was put on hold while the waitress talked to someone else. She didn't put me on mute so at first I didn't know who she was talking to. I called back a second time and the same thing happened. I was about to hang up again but we were hungry, and hunger won out. I could hear that the delivery time would be about 45 mins. for a late Saturday night and decided to pick it up.  Our pizzas were about $35 for the two. Great crust, lots of toppings, good amount of sauce. My husband came back to the hotel with the yummy goodness and was stopped several times by people asking where he went. He gave them the coupons from the top of the box. I hope they got business from that. We'd definitely order from them again when in AZ.

$5 parking. And the "rides" are not cheap. There's a $15 wristband. But there's not much to get on or do. And they charge for the some of the shows. The town itself is really sad.   We asked the guy by the mechanical horses for change. He was funny and talked my dad into getting like $10 worth of quarters. My dad being a nice guy went along with it. Come to find out none of the horses worked. He saw all the kids on them. I know because he made a joke about them being on Siesta. Jerk.

We were here to buy a faucet for my aunt as a bday present. The man in the wheelchair in the plumbing department was rude and condescending. My husband is a plumber and knows what he is talking about and this guy rolled his eyes at us and tried to tell him he was wrong. I don't live here thank goodness. But my aunt does and said he was that way with her too. Maybe he needs an employee evaluation and retraining in customer service. End of rant.

The line was long to get in for a Friday (2/20).  The employees openly talked about their frustrations to one another while checking us in.  TACKY!  Save it for the break room ladies.  I don't need to hear about how your Manager made you come out and help.. ME!   What can I say?  It was a basic room.  Queen bed my eye though.  We were like sardines in there.  But what do you expect in Vegas.  The 2 rooms were about $320 for 2 nights.  The bathrooms don't have fans.  A bit odd.  We had to open the doors while showering to let the steam out.  The only cool thing was the iron and ironing board in the room.  The were doing construction on the pool area when we went.  Might want to check that out before booking your stay.  And they are dead serious on cut off being 4 p.m. for the pool.  You can't even get in there to see what it looks like cause they lock the doors.  Oh, and it's $30 for late check-out.  No courtesty hour here!

It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.

We came here over Memorial weekend for a late lunch, early dinner. Lunch is served until 3 or 4 so that was awesome. We ordered off of the lunch menu and still didn't finish all of our food. The portions here are a good size and they have a big selection. Their bread they serve with the meals was really soft. The food came out at a good pace.   My husband and I had the tri tip steak with coconut shrimp. I subbed out the mashed potatoes for a baked potato. It was so good. Not to mention a big potato. It was served with a creamy sweet butter. My daughter had the bacon burger. That thing was massive but she finished it off. One of my boys had the kid's sliders which came with fries and grape. My other son had mac n' cheese with fries and apple slices. The apples were really fresh and were served with caramel dip.  Our drinks were refilled without even asking. BIG Plus for thirsty patrons. We shared a pitcher of their CJ Red Ale. It was light and refreshing and went down without a fight. It paired nicely with our meat. We took a slice of mile high chocolate cake to go.   They also have a happy hour menu which is served at the bar. I highly recommend that. Also make sure to sign up for the Landry's Select Card to get your rewards points. It's good for several restaurants and attractions.

I was kind of grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place and of the bathrooms. It was as if they turned off the air. Service was slow and it took a while to get refills. The food was not that great and a lot of it had either been sitting out too long or needed to be replenished. I have always wanted to try this place when we come to visit. Now that's out of my system and I can honestly say I wouldn't go back. The only perk of this place was that 2/3 of my kids were young enough to eat for free. Prices are decent, but the quality of food in my opinion wasn't.

We try to come here on every vist to AZ. I like this location way better than the one in Long Beach. And I live in Long Beach and used to work at that location. LOL. The service was prompt and friendly. The server asked if we would like the kid's food with the appetizers which is always nice. He answered all of our questions and gave suggestions. The food was hot and tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We had a good time.

This is our go-to market when we're in Arizona. It reminds me of a nice Ralphs. They are on the high end so if you don't want to pay the prices, drive a little further to Walmart.   The store is clean and you can earn gas rewards. We normally give my aunt's number since we live in CA. I've always had good experiences here. I recommend enrolling in the rewards program for the discounts.

I was in town for the weekend and decided to have a quick dinner with my family. I love Pizza Hut, like love, love them. This one was terrible. The sauce tasted funny and the crust was kind of chewy. This did not even compare to the bad service.  I made an online order and did not receive a call to confirm my order so I called them. They confirmed my order. My husband went to go pick it up. When I got up to get mine I noticed that both pizzas were the same. I called the store and spoke to a manager, she was kind of condesending and made me feel like I was lying. I asked to have the replacement delivered since it was just down the street. She wanted to give me credit and I said no because I don't even live there. She told me it would take 40 mins for it to be delivered and that she would call when it was on it's way.   By then it was already getting late and I was starting to fall asleep. 45 mins passed and there was no call. I was about to call back when I finally got a knock on the door. The driver told me I had a balance due and I said, "Nooooo..." He said oh, you paid online? I said yes. So he said there wasn't a signature line and he had to get my signature. Then he said, that's funny, there's no delivery charge. I said I hope not. He then asked me if they messed up on my previous order and I said yes, I got the wrong pizza. Then he really pissed me off because he's still holding the pizza and annoyingly says, "Well I wish they would've told me this was a freebie!" Why would they tell you that? Does it matter? Do you do something special to it like spit on it before it gets there because it's free?   So rude from beginning to end.

We came here over Memorial weekend for a late lunch, early dinner. Lunch is served until 3 or 4 so that was awesome. We ordered off of the dinner menu though. The portions here are a good size and they have a big selection.  Our favorite thing to order here is the Porterhouse for 2. We were saddened to see that the steak sauce isn't made table side any more. I was looking forward to the smells and warm sauce. My daughter had a really juicy steak sandwich. She asked for the corn as a side and man was it good. Plenty of seasonings and butter. Lightly charred, but still sweet. The boys had mac n cheese off the kids menus.  Other than that, service was great. Our drinks were refilled without even asking. BIG Plus for thirsty patrons. Their bread they serve with the meals was really soft. The food came out at a good pace. And the salads with the meals were really fresh.

When you first walk in you are greeted by friendly faces... And a pastry case. It's really hard not to just order one of each with a cup of coffee. I found this lovely gem while doing a search for breakfast on yelp. The pictures of the food is what brought us here. Wow. What a great find.  We came early for breakfast (before 8:30) on the Memorial weekend and good thing too because the seats outside were completely full of people waiting to get in when we left. It was our first time so we went balls out. I was quickly lured in by the french toast combo, but then the Chicken Fried Chicken caught my eye. My husband ordered the same thing. And to my luck, my daughter ordered the french toast combo so I got to taste her yummy thick cut bacon. My two boys had the pancakes with bacon. I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. Heck, why not!?  I don't think we talked much during the meal. It was mostly, "Ummmm.... This is so good!" Or, "Here, try this, it's really good!" My daughter's hot cocoa was a thing of beauty. It had whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles! Too cute.   We had great service from beginning to end. We asked the manager for syrup to go since we were staying in a hotel. He went a step further and offered us utensils. Yeah, kinda forgot about that part, but he had us covered. The prices were reasonable for our meals averaging about $12 a plate for a big breakfast.   This place is bookmarked and will be on our to do list every year we go back to AZ. Thanks a bunch! You were awesome!

We went to Rattlesnake Cove at Bartlett Lake. It's pretty nice and well kept. You can bbq there and they have a good amount of tables. Get there early because they do fill up.   The bathrooms get dirty quick because everyone is wet from the water. When we went the drain kind of flooded in the smaller of the two stalls.  Rangers do frequent the area on holidays so it's a good idea to get your Tonto Pass at Big 5 before you go. The last few times the road to the Ranger Station was closed off. Better safe than sorry.

We had a really great meal. Our server was Tara. Very attentive, very good service. There aren't any of these restaurants in California so we were happy to try them out. It's silly to have a Black Angus and a Texas Roadhouse nearby. I will just say, we chose wisely.   We ordered the Porterhouse Steak for two. We were going to eat later and didn't want to get too full since we were having a late lunch. The place was pretty empty around 3 p.m. Our steak was a little more cooked than I would have liked, I ordered medium-rare and like my meat to moo. It's okay. At least it wasn't overcooked. The steak sauce made table-side was tasty. We liked ours spicy. The kids burgers and steaks were also good. You might want to ask for condiments for the kids burger as it comes out dry without mayo or mustard. The portions were great and we left feeling satisfied.

I liked it here. I had never been before, but I was buying a cake from my niece and my tia recommended that I go here. I'm from California and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the store. From the outside parking lot, you would think otherwise. There is a sitting area by the produce section where you can enjoy your meal. Everything looks pretty fresh. The prices are higher than where I live, but most things are more expensive in AZ than Cali I've noticed. I purchased a tres leches cake from the bakery and had them write on it. It was really good. I like mine more soggy, but not everyone does. The cake had a layer of chocolate cake on the bottom, a strawberry cream in the middle, and the vanilla leche cake on top. The frosting was light and delicious. I would love to come and have tacos here next time we visit.
