WOW! I came here during lunch time as it appears after their breakfast crowd rush and this place was dirty. I was literally the only person their and yet two of the waitresses standing around were busy on the phone and talking to each other instead of cleaning the disgusting floors.  Not to make my review sound harsh, but the floors were actually disgusting and no better way to put it. Including greasy smudge marks on the windows that look to have been there for a while.  As I mentioned I was the only customer there at the time and my waitress never filled my ice tea even though she was busy organizing bar items and talking on the phone.   The food was hot and appeared to look the part at first, but after I ate their my memory of the food was not so good. I do this sometimes to where I eat somewhere and think its not bad when Im eating it then realize later it was not so good.  Overall I will never go back. Yuck!

THE best bbq in Arizona! The food is amazing here. The chili is to die for and the ribs are delicious!   Great environment and located in the small town of cave creek/care free.   One of my favorites when im in town.
