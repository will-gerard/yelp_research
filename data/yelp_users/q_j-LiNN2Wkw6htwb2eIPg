I'm a little biased being from Phoenix but this is the friendliest airport with the best local food. If you are in from out of town there are tons of local restaurants you can try all under one roof.

This is a great course that can be very forgiving. The front 9 is wide open and the back 9 has more of a desert course feel.   It can get backed up really quick so allow 5+ hours if you go late morning. While it can be a bit slow it is a great course overall.

I decided to go to posters mostly and framing on a whim. I had not heard anything about them or their work, luckily, I chose right!!! They are amazing and provide exceptional service at an affordable price. Dorothy went out of her way to ensure that my needs were exceeded. I not only recommend posters mostly I will also take any and all framing needs to them.

These are the friendliest and most knowledgable folks in the business. They are honest and really make sure you have the best experience.   I had a sentimental watch that needed to be fixed.  They understood the importance and worked directly with the manufacturer to get the pieces they needed to get it back in working condition. They even went as far as calling me to give me updates.

This is where the bushwood elite roam. Make sure to take out a second mortgage if you go to the bar but it's worth every arm and leg.   In all seriousness it is a little pricey but the staff is phenomenal and ensure every memory is one that lasts. Amazing food and drinks and scenery.

BellyRubz is hands down the best place for boarding and day care. The staff are extremely friendly and truly love animals. They have a good setup and are focused on ensuring your pet is safe and enjoys their time.   They do allow all types of dogs and ensure they have a good temperament prior to letting them play. I would suggest this facility to any and everyone.

This facility is state of the art and has all the equipment you need for any workout style. While it does get a bit busy towards the afternoon of you go mid morning the gym is yours. The facility is very clean and you'll get very spoiled by the amenities.   You should know that most people that are there are serious athletes and tend to be very focused.

I would give them 10 stars if I could. I have had some recent troubles with safelite and had multiple warranty issues with the work they did. I was referred to Bluechip and decided to give them a shot....that was the best decision I made.  Kelly was amazingly helpful and friendly and Freddy was the best! They made me feel like a VIP from the moment I called. The work product was better then factory and they helped me understand what my insurance covered and came to my location exactly when they said they would!  By far recommending Bluechip to any and everyone! Do yourself a favor when your insurance company recommends someone tell them you want Bluechip!

The Jewelers here are the nicest and most considerate I have worked with.  All of them were very knowledgable and went above and beyond to assist.   I will hands down only come here for any and all needs from repairs to purchases.

I had not been to an optometrist in quite some time and had no idea where to go. I decided to try Excel vision based off a referral and am very pleased with the service provided. The whole office was extremely nice, professional and knowledgeable. They went above and beyond to make my experience amazing.   I did not elect to have eye insurance at work and the front desk staff was able to identify a savings program through my medical plan to help cover the costs!! They are the best.

The employees are super nice however if you need a purse fixed you might want to carefully check all places. I asked if they could fix a purse that was "customized" by a puppy and they advised they would fix it.   Unfortunately it was not the best quality for $95 and they conveniently forgot they were going to touch it up. When I asked for my money back he laughed. Just make sure you get everything in writing and I would get out a couple places. Luckily I didn't bring my nice shoes or luggage here....could have been a more costly mistake.

The food and service are phenomenal... Not to mention their pizza cookie deserves the noble peace prize!  The kitchen is very accommodating to requests and special orders which makes Oreganos even more amazing!

The Joint- specifically Dr. Pete-is amazing! He was very friendly knowledgable and took the time to help me understand what was going on with my back and what the expectations should be.   I am a first timer and originally had some hesitancies as I was not familiar with what to expect. The pain I was feeling became unbearable so I decided to take a chance and have never looked back since. After the initial adjustment I began to feel improvements and I keep feeling better after each visit.  I read some of the reviews and have to say even when the office was busy I still received the full attention from Dr Pete and did not feel rushed.   Thank you Dr Pete for helping my back feel better.

A little disappointed in the pet hotel. My puppy is a boxer lab mix. There was no concern when making the reservation, however, when we checked in with the hotel we were advised she would not be allowed to play with other dogs because she had "traits/looks of a bully breed". This left us left without a safe comfortable place to leave our puppy.   The only solution we were offered was to pay an additional $25 a day for 2-15 min walks. We only had a few hours to find an alternative.

Rick and his team are extremely professional, knowledgable, and friendly. Rick goes above and beyond to ensure you not only get the best price but more importantly the best quality. I had previously brought my Jeep in and now 3-series and would bring any car no matter what condition or value. He treats all customers and cars the same, as if they are his own.  For those that "don't give 5's" you need to grow up- he an his team deserve far more than a 5.

I am so glad they reopened the location in north Scottsdale a year or so ago. They worked out some kinks and its a great atmosphere and super nice employees.   At times they get a little behind with seemingly small volume however this is a great family atmosphere. They do not play any UFC or boxing from my understanding so you may want to look elsewhere.

I originally had a jaded view since our 9:00 reservation didn't get seated until 10:15. However the staff did make up for it with free champagne and appetizers.   They truly went above and beyond to make up for the slight issue with timing. I would come back here. The food was great and service was good- very friendly.

This is a solid choice for golf equipment and is usually fairly empty. The staff is friendly and very willing to help.   While this is not a PGA superstore there still is an excellent selection.

The food is pretty good and to me better than fired pie and most other pizza places. The sauce is a little sweeter than most and reminds me of a fast food version of Grimaldi's. The quality is good employees are great.   If you like chicken wings they have amazing wings. They grill them in the oven and they are not too oily.   All in all its a great place for a quick pizza and wings. Not many TVs so I would not go for a game but would pick up food for a game there.
