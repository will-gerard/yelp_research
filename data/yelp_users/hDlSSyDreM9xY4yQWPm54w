I remember when going to the Spaghetti Company was something to look forward to. Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed "rooms" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.  I've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.  Once inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!  Our server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.  The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.  Bread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue "I can't believe it's not butter" for false advertising.  The salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the "balsamic" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.  There are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent? Surely it is not at the Old Spaghetti Factory.

I have put off writing this review for so long because the memories of my experience there are so ugly that I needed weeks to recover. It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying.  As a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might.  The main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh.  As is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas!   I immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. "Was the water bad too?" I wondered.  I'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all.  The birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies.  But back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures.  You know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting.  My brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style.   Macayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within. They can release my tormented soul from the hell that is Macayo's.

DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.  Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?  FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.  Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.  --cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture; --salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar; --special "top shelf" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead; --rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!; --refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered. --chicken "guisado" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it; --flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment; --sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!  After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH.

A WRAITH OF AMERICANA LONG UNDEAD, CHURNING OUT CACA AT OUTRAGEOUS PRICES  --$3.50 slice of ham --$4.00 glass of concentrated OJ --3am best time to visit; you're going to be sick in an hour anyway from the booze you drank earlier.  --no "honey"-calling, gum-chewing flos anywhere to be seen --only the blur-in-motion Mexican-girl dishwasher/busers who can clear a table in 3.8 seconds --24-7 operation means this place never gets a deep clean and it shows --bathroom towels NEVER stocked --window blinds caked in mud --buser station crusty with layers of splattered milk and grease  And the food is atrocious.  Not even grilled cheese makes it past the gag reflex  Get me outa here!!!

IT'S THE 1982 WEDDING RECEPTION THE BRIDE'S DAD DECIDED TO HOST IN HIS HALFWAY REMODELED SUNROOM/PORCH YOU WERE HOPING TO FORGET.  --why is this 6 block area of Thomas stuck in 1982? --flashing colored lights were in bad taste, even THEN --live music is only redeeming quality, and it's BAD --belly dancer goes after EVERYONE in the room. yes, it's THAT wedding reception --stackable vinyl elk's lodge chairs lost their cush in 1984. HOW can they still be in use? --plate breaking at $2 a pop turns quickly into an exercise in dodging ceramic shrapnel. thank god we were not close.  SERVICE HORRIBLE --forgot salads, then dropped them when we were about to leave anyway --drinks never refilled, beers never checked --it's like we were just invisible and unwelcome --host/owner saw us about to leave, but then turned away  FOOD JUST WAY PAST ITS TIME --cuisine has come such a long way since 1982. get with it! --NO ONE actually wants to eat a pile of raw onions buried under globs of mucousy "greek" dressing.  WHY!!? --everything's in 1982 except the prices. You want me to pay $20 for that?!?  Now I know why no one has ever mentioned this place to me _in my entire life_. Some places are better left undiscovered.

overpriced for "beep-beep-beep" everything, but some of the table jukeboxes work!  --omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made, ew. where did it come from? --they must have silenced the microwaves, or the beeping from the "kitchen" would have drowned out the music. --not much food prepared here, just reheat, serve, and charge a bundle for it  The recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by Shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary. Don't have a grill? No problem, we can make your eggs benedict for you, almost-ready-to-serve. No toaster? No problem. We can deliver it pre-toasted. [stepping down...ok i'm done now]  I loved being able to select diner tunes from the table's mini-juke. It worked too! Note: some of the tables' jukes are possessed by demons and may suddenly start, or not work at all. Take your chances when dropping your two-bits.  I love the vibe, just not the food. Unfortunately, that's what I go to a restaurant for, THE FOOD.

I have a long love-hate, divorced, remarried, divorced relationship with Christopher's. Perhaps it is my overall disgust with the French offerings of late and their seeming laziness of effort in technique, but Christopher's just doesn't cut it anymore.  Paola was always too aggressive on her wine list. Impressive to look at, but a disappointment to order from... sorry, don't have that... sorry, don't have that either. It was always something you just had to get used to, mildly expressing your disappointment and frustration with your server; they'll never get it.  Recently, they've been able to get a super discount on salt. They use it liberally on everything. My last two visits have been such. I have such respect for Christopher and his team, the first time I just grinned and bore it. But this last time, I did send my main course back. What happened to the godly veal reduction? It tastes manufactured... does Shamrock even do a veal stock? I shudder to think. (I flee any building with marks of Shamrock foods.)  My favorites have been the pastry of snails (escargot), the filet of beef, the mushroom soup, the onion soup, the sautee d'fois gras, the pear salad, and of course the cheese plate. Oh, I almost forgot, the decadent osso bucco and accompanying pile of pasta.  I miss the days when Christopher served a set of 10 tables on the other side of 24th street. Sure, the CD of Chopin Nocturnes played the same track over and over, but the fois gras was to die for and the Bordeaux I had my heart set on was immediately available.  What is happening to fine dining in this town? Where else can I go? Please. PLEASE! Tell me.

Pricey due to high esplanade rent. Great stop before or after your AMC. Choose pastries not baguette.   --wow. $65 for two sandwiches with side salads, bottle of lemonade, sparkling water and dessert.   --baguettes not authentic.  --pasta salad bland --but its all about the bread for a proper sandwich mixte avec crudities. And this bread was NOT it.  --great cafe feel and French owners lend authenticity --worth it for the the pastries.   Still on a quest for the proper French baguette.

Bland, uninspired, boring and dark. Great happy hour spot. Don't miss Spicy Mary.   --light provided by a cluster of 4 low-watt street-lamp-style globes and candles goes  for a sidewalk cafe, but it was just too dark. --chicken gumbo uninteresting --red beans and rice, no flavor --jumbalaya a mound of bland rice with flecks of meat --sausage very authentic with ground spicy bits of hooves and snouts, except I can still feel those bits, ew! --crawdads are the only palatable dish, though it's not far from a Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet.  --Spicy Mary made with Absolut Peppar and marinated asparagus. Don't miss it.  --live low slow blues guitar and jazz styles missing the energy I wanted --food also missing a kind of mischief I expect from this cuisine; I have to douse everything with Tabasco.  Baby kay's is a Phoenix stalward, having survived for at least 15 years, but probably longer. Am Missing something? Is Southern cooking just not interesting? I think not. I'll hav to pull out my old VCR tapes of that heavy French accent narrating Best Chefs of the World.

Tutti Santi is one of our valley jewels. Nina is so wonderful, I hope you can meet her -- her hospitality and joy in preparing a feast for you and your guests is very hard to match.  I went to celebrate a friend's birthday, so I started with a bottle of champagne. I know it's very Reunite of me, but I like Spumanti. And there it was on the list. Excellent. Followed with a bottle of Pinot Gris, but it was too cold.  Linguine with Clams was divine. Didn't have the creamy thickness of the lavish dish I had in Venice last month until I dumped half the shaker's Parmesan on top (ok, it was closer to 3/4 of the shaker), but oh, SO good. The sourdough bread was hot and fresh -- mmm, my favorite.  We finished off with a flaming shot of licorice liqueur. I wasted so much time taking a picture of it, the glass burned my lips when I actually got to tasting it. LOL.  Tutti is not pretentious, just very good food and excellent service. A must try.

great cold salad (crab and shrimp louie). excellent happy hour drink specials. stay away from anything cooked, fried or with a sauce.  GARDE MANGER -- YOU GO GIRL! --excellent crab and shrimp louie. kudos to garde manger! --watercress, arugula and pear salad. nice flavor mix, great choice.  AVOID ANYTHING COOKED, FRIED OR WITH A SAUCE. --sweet potato fries absolutely uninteresting, even with the ketchup cocktail sauce that came with them. --chicken medallions (from frozen microwave bag) laden with chemicals, resembles a piece of chicken, but better served out of the sliding door of star trek: original series' food dispenser. YUCK. --shrimp tempura roll served on globalthermonuclear-hot plate. didn't realize you could burn dried seaweed.  MENU GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON ...once you get past the _30 page_ main menu... with pictures..., double-sided specials and desserts menu and triangle stand-up drinks specials menu (what?!), you might think you were in one of the infamous chinese high-rise restaurants featuring 500 or more items cooked on multiple floors. move over, cheesecake factory: your spiral bound book has nothing on e-bar!  SIGHTS, SOUNDS AND SMELLS be careful not to sit next to the kitchen. noisy! i don't remember plate clanking so loud since Roy's Scottsdale. I think they actually had a position called "plate clanker" back then.  today's visit had its olfactory surprises as well. raw sewage smell from the bathrooms. EW.  the slowly waving ceiling fans, elephant wall and the curvy monochrome of the booths, all laid out in a row reminds me of the Indiana Jones Safari Disneyland ride... you know, the one where you're riding in a hummer.  ugh.corporate cookie cutter restaurant chains: bite the dust!

THE FINEST THE SOUTHWEST HAS TO OFFER. A life-changing culinary and spiritual event. Redefines the southwestern style as the highest-of-high in haute cuisine. An adventure of detail down to the individual salt grains. (That's for the iPhoners... now for the Rest... of the story...)  This review has been percolating in my head for six months, almost to the day. With the recent tighter link between Yelp and Facebook, I realize it is time to promulgate the News that is the New Gospel of Southwestern Cuisine as bestowed on us by Chef O'Dowd. You may have read his praises in the local media these past months. Just one week after I dined there, Mobil granted it five stars -- the only Arizona establishment in any category to have this rating at present, and one of only four restaurants in the USA given the designation this year.  But my introduction to Kai was nothing so grand. It began as a destination to commemorate a friendship I hold dear to my heart and to celebrate her birthday. As is our custom, I called Maitre'D to make several special requests including one for our dessert. It was a night I shall remember for decades to come.  I may say the evening began the moment I crossed the property line and made my sojourn along a mile-long road and through a manicured yet natural presentation of desert flora. When I arrived at the hotel building entrance and stepped out of my car, there was NO ONE anywhere to be found. No bellman, no valet, no guests. The dim light of the entrance welcomed me as I walked into the grand lobby. I could hear a waterfall but there was no one anywhere in sight. Then from nowhere a valet greeted me and took my name. After that introduction, Ritz-Carlton style, every staff person I met knew my name. TRIPLE BING!!  This place celebrates the Story. It provides little spotlit nooks for two, three or more, or even seating in front of a fireplace. And that's just Kai's bar area! We waited over a round of drinks (including a perfectly made Sapphire martini) because we were told that a special table awaited us.  The celebration continued with the most unique and moving presentation of a menu I have ever experienced. Covered in textured rose-fuchsia-colored fabric and inlaid with watercolor from an artist in residence, our captain placed the table candle in front of it and let its flickering shadows on the fabric backlight the story of the land and the history of this property all the way to the selection of locally-grown (yes he pointed in the direction of the gardens) vegetables and herbs. My eyes were welling up as he finished.  Our pour of sparkling water was complimented with our choice of garnish including blood orange and peach among the "usual" lemon, lime or cucumber slices.  (getting this out of the way) Sommelier was the only distraction. Clearly not at his best, his bumblings included improper pouring etiquette, coming back to ask which Duckhorn we wanted, Merlot or Chardonnay, leaving the Champagne bottle on the table after the pour, and not refilling our empty wine glasses when checking in on us. UM!   OK, back to the bliss. Of course we had to order the 12 course tasting menu. Each course was a sublime tapestry of flavor sensations. Even the one-bite Amuse was a symphony of 15, all working in careful harmony. I got to have two courses of fois gras (DOUBLE BING!) and the duck was so perfect, mild and elegant that even the three salt crystals intruded on its divinity. Second time 'round I had no salt. Heaven on earth. (see my profile's last meal preference)  The final blow was our dessert. Although it had the ingredients I requested, it was entirely new. The strawberries had been infused with a candy-like vinegar and must have been several hours in their preparation. The fresh mint with the presentation was merely a garnish; the strawberries were as full of mint as if they had spent their lives in the same soil -- maybe they had! The balsamic was carefully chosen and perfectly matched. Like the perfection in every other detail, small pepper grains lined one side of the rim and dared us to pull them down. The dish's coronation was the creme fraiche executed at the exact moment, seconds before the presentation. Chef had to have stayed all the way to the end to make that execution.  With all my heart I thank Chef for sharing his talent and craft. These few words only vaguely illuminate the wonders that await you at Kai. I hope that you find your way there for a special meal; it'll be one you won't soon forget.

Venerable Chef Hiromasa Kyodasan and crew's recent arrival heralds an upcoming rocket to higher food standards. After just 4 weeks, his discerning approach is already evident, but he has his work cut out for him.  --controlling hostess is stickler for seating rules; _throw down_ to avoid a 30 min wait, or just ask for the manager --Kyodasan brought with him two chefs, one kitchen, one teppan. great things to come! --he's already fixed wasabi (no more tubes), --gari is fresh and tart (not from a jar one month opened) and --seaweed wraps are dry and crispy, rolls made fresh, not in advance --fish selection (corporate "sashimi grade" blech), and tempura batter will change up first of the year. --great family place, main dining is loud and boisterous --benihana "experience" feels forced and scripted --watch out for upsell-freak waiters at your teppan table --one lunch server is power smoker, taking 3 minute breaks _during service_, then thinking we wouldn't smell his breath. EW.  in the end it's all about the food, and the food is... --bland, gooey, overcooked, or undercooked. --teppan fried rice's egg is _always_ burned. how about adding it at the last moment, not starting it first?? --side salad is often not fresh --miso is colored water, no substance or rich flavor I'm expecting --ginger and mustard sauces are the same for every main dish  Chef recalls that the last time I visited him at his Shiro (now sadly closed) the county inspector was in the kitchen. What are the odds that on the day I discover his arrival at Benihana, she shows up again?! They'll think I'm some sort of spy. Of course, she arrived right amidst the lunch rush!  I hope my update will mark a dramatic improvement over the next weeks and months.  GO HIRO!

DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. WON'T GO BACK. EVER. I hoped that having Hiromasasan at the sushi bar could save this place from wraithdom, but i was wrong. Not even the finest sushi chef in the valley could save you, benihana!  --sushi deluxe sampler lunch "features" one piece each of their "best" fish. POO!   NOT FRESH!    --I could have done better at Kyoto Bowl !!! SHAME ON YOU! --ever felt like you might actually be dead, and "this" is purgatory? yeah, that was me.  when it was all over, i whispered, "are they forcing you to serve this &$@# ?" one eyebrow up.  "are you proud of THAT?" i pointed at the case. "no." came the reply.  i have such great respect for you kyodasan, but _WHERE, OH WHERE HAVE YOUR STANDARDS GONE?_  that was last week. i went again today to give them one more chance. (double-x is serious business, you know.) didn't even make it past the hostess nazi. --as she told me there is a "10 minute wait", i peered into the restaurant and saw... --5 empty tables filled with dirty dishes!!! --all but two seats at the bar were empty  @Hiro: let me know where you end up next.  @benihana: DOUBLE-X.

_STILL_ DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. WON'T GO BACK. EVER. Gimmicky play-with-your-food-is-OK teppan-style dining's novelty keeps packing people in. Not me.  I went back after 18 months, and thankfully saved myself a tidy fiddy. I left shortly after arriving.  ##maguro is that pink plank that you get from House of Rice (Is that place still out there?) CRAP!   Yet they still fill the place. Somehow. On arrival, as usual, there are 15 people waiting to be seated. Not surprisingly there is NO ONE sitting at the sushi bar. We sit right down. But what I see is nauseating.  ##One or two pieces of cut fish on each large white plastic plate.  It looks like a morgue-slash-biology-project gone wrong. They're already wearing rubber gloves. All that's missing are the surgical masks!  OK, so what are all these people doing here then? It's for Teppanyaki-style dining. It's the novelty of your food being steel-grill cooked in front of you, The cook will even play with your food like you used to when you were 4 years old and if you take your mom with you, you can thumb your nose at her while you play along.  Ooh, look at me pile the rice up like a heart and then stick my spatula under it to make it beat! Don't miss the Sliced onion volcano and steamy railroad train, complete with sound and lighting effects!  Yeah, fried rice's egg must be added at the last moment. It's so the egg will be light and flavorful, not charred hard after 8 minutes of food play!  @Hiro: let me know where you end up next.  @benihana: DOUBLE-X. YOUARETHEWEAKESTLINK GOOD BYE.

FRENCH BISTRO STYLE STRAIGHT FROM PARIS. FINEST QUALITY MODERN FRENCH TO BE HAD IN PHOENIX.  In the vast wasteland that is North Scottsdale, there are but few jewels among the cookie-cutter chains. Zinc Bistro stands in defiance of those mere reflections serving the most excellent of haute cuisine in its stalwart selections at lunch or dinner.  Whether it be TRUFFLE OMELET or the ZINC BURGER or the newly added TOMATO BISQUE or the perennial CRAB SALAD (ladies-who-lunch revolted when chef updated the presentation), combined with the fabulous bread (served on request), a glass of Chateau Greysac, and the heavenly CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE (don't forget to order it in advance), it's a meal fit for a proper two-hour French luncheon.  The daily specials never cease to amaze. Just be sure to arrive by 11:30 if you hope to get one; they go fast!  My other favorites include the scrumptiously delicate and rich SCALLOPS WITH LENTILS, the PRIME FLAT IRON STEAK with a delectable reduction and aromatic rosemary, and of course, the ONION SOUP GRATINEE.  Chef Carter's pedigree shows in his food, meticulously prepared: Cordon Bleu, Chef Christopher Gross (of Christopher's, now at the Biltmore Fashion Park), and Chef Dennis Keller  Not to be missed. Whether you find yourself in Kierland town or looking for an excuse to explore what used to be Frank Lloyd Wright's "desert view" turned city, Zinc Bistro is the crown jewel.

this is the real thing, no frills. boars head, deli salads, brisket, balls. accept no substitutes  --rolls are just right for these hoagies. flavorful and soak up whatever sauce goes with your meat. --MEAN beef brisket --meatballs and sauce. ooh the sauce. --sausage and peppers. oh, which one to pick?  --trio salad of egg salad, chicken salad and tuna salad on a plate of lettuce. Italian dressing has mild vinegar. --great deli salads. take your pick: broccoli and cashew, macaroni, potato, they're all tasty --three fridges of beverages. all the flavors. take your pick. --service with the kind of New York 'tude you'd expect from a place like this. --casual and small dining area, some tables outside too, but not when it's summer.  It's worth the drive.

Steady fish, hit or miss. Traditional favorites, but where is the passion?  -- excellent maguro and tako # steady yellowtail (not fresh) and I ordered sashimi! # cold gyoza # ramen too salty, noodle too eggy, broth too dark  Methinks one might get better fish cuts with more regular patronage. Let's see.

make sure you get the right sized table for your party, but it's all smooth sailing for this best-of-phoenix local brewery. DRINK UP!!!   ...but careful what you eat  it's a LOOONG way to tempe sometimes. this location has just the same short, quick attitude you've come to expect from your tempe staff, but it's all business. i'm ok with that...  --keeping my glass full of that lovely kiltlifter, 8th street or IPA. that's what counts --televisions in every direction, and staff's accommodating willingness to switch to the foreign football/soccer games keeps my european colleagues satiated! nice! --seasonal choices keep it mixin for good times, every time. --chef salad is the best thing there. crispy, cold and fresh salad mix. --fish and chips. frozen, then refried. if it works for you, this could be a good choice. if only the tartar weren't from a vat. --carne adobada had been good, but rice now too salty, not fresh. red sauce lost its quality too. belongs in the list below, but it could be a fluke.   i'm probably not here for the food, but worth noting. # all dressings from the vat. UGH. # chicken wings are my non-favorite standard stand-in-my-own-shit-while-you-pump-me-full-of-antibiotics-so-i-don't-die-while-the-growth-hormones-do-their-thing-in-a-record-76-days-and-then-they-slaughter-me feed-lot fatty shit-ass chicken "meat". sorry. # stuffed potato skins. should'a pitched those in the bin, not reused them two days later. blech. # burgers are a miss in every way. ugh. better tasting from costco's stack-o-frozen ready to grill cardboard... :(

Shame on you. The most disgusting sushi I have ever had in my life.  --beep beep edamame is still raw even after nuking (I should have fled when I heard it) --didnt think it was possible to ruin a Philly roll but you can if the cream cheese is RANCID!! --gari tastes of dishwasher rinse agent --nigiri rice is WARM under almost frozen hamachi!! --salmon wilted and old --retail grade maguro (House of Rice).  All cashier/server could say after our complaints and charging full price was "would you like your receipt?" $60 FOR THE WORST SUSHI OF MY LIFE.   PFFU^% OFF AND DIE!!!  I only made it down the street to the Safeway where I had to pull over and PUKE!! Faded salmon and RANCID CREAM CHEESE!!!  Wishing I could "unlike" C.N., Pam S. and MiMi P., after whose reviews I ventured to Sakura on Faith. SHAME ON YOU!!!

I remember when I used to sit with proprietor David L. at Biltmore C.P. (not CPK, you freak) and listen to him get passionate about this modular bakery concept thing where he could use the best ingredients and still make it inexpensively. Willo Bread was born.  I also remember when I was little going to My Florist for FLOWERS. Over the years, the strip mall saw many tenants come and go and seemingly at just the right moment, David picked up one of the suites and began his bakery project. After its extreme success with local AJ's and "fine" restaurants around town, he expanded to the old flower shop (converting it to a restaurant), its loft overhead and the adjoining suite for the grocery.  Perhaps it was my third visit that was the one I shan't forget. I am a pianist and have played professionally here and there over the years. After hearing just one selection by SAVANT [Nicole?] I was so discouraged I resolved never to play again. I hate her (not really) for being so good. Try going up to talk to her and you'll see what I mean. She's clearly multi-tasking on 7 or 8 different threads, one of which is to talk with you. I've seen her on the phone while playing with one hand, reaching out to the nearby table while playing with one hand, totally looking the opposite direction for minutes at a time, and more. Total Savant.  She easily has the entire repertory of all music in her head, but for her it is not the music itself, but the concepts of the music from which she plays. She can play the entire soundtrack from Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. It's uncanny. Ask her to play a classical piece, and only because you know the exact note order, phrases and timings do you realize that she's pretty close, but not exact. Who cares? She could play against Mozart in dueling pianos and he'd end up on the floor gasping in and out of a paper bag.  At some point David bought her a concert Steinway, well deserved.  Other than the place where [name?] played during her lifetime, My Florist will have no other mark on the history of Phoenix. To those of us still alive wishing we could add our own marks on history, our screaming and YELLING about the poor service, useless bartenders and ridiculous menu will be but whispers against her virtuosity. But let me make my attempt.  Seeing my favorite bottle of gin on the shelf, I ordered my martini: "Sapphire martini, straight up, stirred (!!!) with a twist". What came back was a brown thing that looked like chocolate milk. "Oh, I thought you ordered an espresso martini." Tell me, does Sapphire sound like "espresso" to you? My answer is... only to someone who has NO CLUE about what a real martini is. Do me a favor and don't insult the reputation of Bombay Sapphire: please instead display and serve Gordon's.  After a recent performance of the Arizona Broadway Theater, we joined the cast as they gathered for a late dinner and drinks. After the 25 of us ate and drank, we spent the next 55 minutes (no joke) figuring out the bill because they couldn't split the check, not even in half. forGET it! (don't you forget CASH -- in small denominations -- if you're going with a group).  If from the limited menu you think you can picture the four tubs of ingredients and sauces in the kitchen, mixed in all the possible 10 ways on the menu, it's because you can: the Dole European Lettuces variety salad mix is the same on every single plate, the same olives and olive oil or orange and apple wedges garnish every dish, and the same bread (yes, it can be good if you buy it first thing in the morning), is sliced and toasted to make you think it isn't as old and hard as it actually is.  Not to say that the bread isn't good. Just know that when bread is made this way (without all the nasty chemicals and preservatives), and then is exposed to AIR, it gets hard. Eat it within a few hours of being baked. My advice is to go to the grocery first thing when it opens and try to get one of the 4 willowich sandwiches available daily (scrumptious ham, cheese, basil and add vinaigrette) before they go. You'll have to beat me, so get up early.

--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone? --bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL. --remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.  --rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor. --table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people! --guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew! --chili colorado is just thick, no flavor. --service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high. --$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend.

Thank God we live in America. I can't imagine that this could be the standard in another country.  I have been to next-door Los Compadres hundreds of times, but never ventured into Diamonds. It's a weird Chinese looking building, but as many times as I've driven by, I'd never gone in. Until recently.  My brother and I resolved to finally check it out. We parked in back and made our way toward the front door. There was water streaming across the driveway into the gutter, and white bits of something were strewn throughout. I didn't think much of it at the time.  When we opened the door, we were instantly greeted with the sight, sound and smell of 5 huge aquariums, all holding seafood that presumably was going to be eaten soon. I got the distinct impression that the floor hadn't been swept in three or four months.  After we made our order and sat waiting for our take out, I noticed a large brown spot on the front of the counter. Hmmm... And then it moved. Oh my god. This is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life. It must have been five inches long. I was mortified such that I could not find my voice. And then a second one appeared, and then a third. OMG. I finally got the manager's attention and pointed to it. She quickly moved to the front of the counter, and cupping her hand, caught it, and then scurried back to the kitchen with it.  I was going to be sick. I ran toward the bathroom, and found myself splashing through a big puddle all the way to the toilet. UGH. The toilet was already full from someone before me. So I flushed. And then came the most wrong sound you've ever heard come from a water pipe as and what was in the toilet started rising to the top. I fled and grabbed my brother by the arm.  As I squished my way back along the walkway toward the driveway, I realized what was streaming across the parking lot and into the gutter. It was raw sewage littered with bits of wet toilet paper.  Someone needs to shut this place down.

Hire a busboy! I had to say it. I had to take these pictures. This is my _third_ visit since my May update with the same result and I can't keep it to myself any longer. The staff neglects the dining room. Period. Dot. Patrons often have to move dirty plates, stacking them up on top of trays at another table, just to sit down.  My recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self-busing fast-food places and make _us_ do it if you're not going to.  I have to wonder what happens to all those half-filled salsa squirt bottles left on the tables unrefrigerated for so long. Do they top off and return them to service, or are they emptied and washed before refilling?  It is my sincere hope that very soon I will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal. Until then, I have to advise driving a bit further south to Mi Patio, or north to Sylvia's La Canasta.

My dad used to take me to Mary Coyle's for weekday dessert after lunching at Sir George's buffet West of Central on Indian School. I had to be like 3 years old. It was one of our neighborhood mainstays. A perfect birthday treat, or a place to go for no reason at all, just to enjoy company over lusciously divine creamy goodness.  Mary Coyle's was host to my very first on-my-own sit-down dining experience where I paid my own bill. Of course I had been raised on its ice cream since I can remember being able to put a spoon in my own mouth, but I was 10 or 11 and my best friend and I rode up on Saturday for lunch. They had just started serving sandwiches and chili. I remember feeling so grown up leaving a $0.25 tip after paying for our lunch, having no idea what the gratuity formula was. I remember it was (Matriarch) Coyle who served us.  Over the years their children moved away after brief turns at managing the place and eventually they moved to the current 7th Ave location. Management/ownership changed to a non-blood relation who chose to keep the restaurant name and the names of the menu items.  I refuse to step foot in the place again in solidarity with others' experiences of which I cannot enumerate here for legal reasons. Before having made that decision, I could easily say that in my own opinion the ice cream is of decidedly lower quality than that of its former glory and that for this review I can give it a second star only for the fond memories the sign evokes as I drive by.

The Prime is my neighborhood Chinese choice. With the Camelback Light-rail construction all but finished, the City gave her a left-turn lane into the property for Eastbound traffic and the nearby Stargate (have to see it to believe it) for convenient access to diners from other times and dimensions. When the light-rail station arrives, the asshole landlord of this eyesore of a strip mail will no doubt double her rent again, but in the mean time, Jenny's place resides just blocks from home.  Jenny (and her family) make you feel like you're sitting at her kitchen table, as she shares with you from the bounty of her generosity and love as your host. That being said, please do not expect a five-star dining experience. As Eric noted, the service can be a bit slow, but It's excellent food, prepared with the best ingredients.  Among my favorites are the (1) wor wonton soup (normally an appetizer for two), made red with spoonfuls of hot chili sauce, (2) the chicken noodle soup (which has nursed me to health through many stomach bugs and influenzas over the years), (3) the bbq pork ribs, and (4) the shrimp and vermicelli clay pot dish.  As of the writing of this article, her niece had just joined the staff as server and helper. She's a bit green, so cut her a little slack.  The Prime is easily the cleanest and quietest Chinese restaurant you'll ever dine in. You can enjoy your food and company in peace among the artful collage art of another nearby restaurant owner and laminated "brushed-steel" tables. None of the bustling. Chinese-ranting lunatics nor assigned "plate clanker" of China Chili, nor the scurrying cockroaches and leaking sewage lines of Diamonds, the wandering hairs (3 in two different consecutive visits) of Super Dragon, the jarred, made-in-Texas sauces of corporate cookie-cutter Pei-Wei, nor the flickering fluorescents and cracked Formica of Gourmet House of Hong Kong. Just good eats.  Don't miss it.

Excellent flavors, carefully crafted. Casual spot for very tasty Italian.   --careful! kitchen closes at 8pm; --BEST tomato sauce I've had in a long time; cooked easy and not overdone, FULL of flavor; --high quality of vegetables shines through every dish; --salad mix is fresh and vibrant; --did I say FRESH? --new bright sign (see the picture) makes it easy to find.; --no fuss ambiance, come as you are, it's about the FOOD.  Just a bit more about those tomatoes. Where DOES he get them? They burst with water like they do in Italy, not just chewy and pulpy like those (possibly genetically altered) waxy ones we get here.  Only other comment is that the pasta is just a bit overcooked for my taste, prefer more al dente, but this could be the preparation to cater to the masses who would otherwise say it's not cooked enough.

I must admit I'm not an experienced thrifter. But after my honey gave me a dazzling electric blue and gold Hawaiian-style button down that shimmers and is slick smooth last year for my b-day (OK, I stole it from his closet and after wearing it so many times, he finally agreed to let me hang it in mine), I resolved a few weeks ago to finally make the trek and see what it is all about.  I had a gig right nearby so I was limited to about 20 minutes' browsing. Clothes were neatly hung and at a comfortable height to facilitate browsing by folks of any height -- I hate having to reach up, or get someone with a pole to pull down a piece hanging from a rack near the ceiling. I did long- and short-sleeved shirts.  OK. So you know you're shopping and you see something that piques but then you see the price tag and you're like, "well, it's nice and all, but DAMN it's not that nice"? So imagine you instead see it, like it, and then look at the price and it's $3.99. YEAH!  And these shirts have been professionally laundered and pressed before hanging. NICE. I still take them to Uptown so they look right, but DAMN. In just a few minutes, my cart was full to the brink of explosion.  Then I did the corner racks. And I pull to this nice brocade texture, purple, and with french cuffs. OMG. I grab it. It's Jhane Barnes! OMG. I actually looked around me like I was on candid camera or something. Am I really about to get this $350 piece for $3.50? HAHAAHAHAHA!  All told, after the people behind me at the check out line stopped grumbling and giving me nasty looks -- hey, I was at least prepping the shirts so the tags could be scanned quickly -- I walked out with some 20 nearly-new pieces for a HUNDRED BUCKS.  EFF-YOU Nieman's, DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH Saks. I've already got my collectibles -- dozens of them. These are just wear and enjoy myself. Love it. Do it.

Legit Chinese for the pros. Umami flavors that pack a wallop that will leave your tongue swoll up and barely usable for speech. Win!   When you walk in, the aromas are already piquing your palate.  We were the only non-Asians in the place. It's a sign that you're in the right spot.  Legit like China Doll on dim sum Sunday used to be.   When you get the menu, skip to the back page where the real food begins: -- shark fin soup -- salty fish fried rice -- clams with spicy basil -- Hong Kong style noodle dishes -- lobster or oysters or both! -- crispy fried intestines -- golden mushroom with spicy fried tofu -- the list goes on!  Don't let the cafeteria feel of the dining room put you off. You're here for the best goddam Chinese food you've had in a while!!  *** the best jasmine tea at $0.50 per person for unlimited pours *** clams with spicy basil. Epic.  Take it with a glass of plum wine for perfect balance.   * sticky white rice that goes perfectly with every dish. Save for last after your plate is full of sauce. Devour.   ***** golden mushroom with spicy fried tofu. Leaves you gasping for air as your tongue goes into overload with umami.  * delectable plateful of orange wedges to finish.   Wow. Just wow.  The neighborhood may be a bit ghetto west of 19rh avenue but this one is worth the trip. Don't miss!!!!

Quick spot for a mall-made mayo-based California roll. This is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong.  You've been hard at work doing swipe-and-sign. Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other "hot" items have a "beep-beep beep-beep" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.

Restaurant Week 3-course Prix Fix BYOB Dinner mostly an Afterthought of POOR quality and execution. Stars were a  +pork belly with sweet potato puree +local mascarpone cheese (served with a burned-black samosa) +Reidel glassware for our selections, brought from home reserves.  [We were not offered the normal prix fix or a la carte menus, only the Restaurant Week menu.]  UNDERSTAFFED --No host stand was a bit awkward for me and guests. Eventually, staring diners shooed us to the huge neighboring wine store to wait. Just uncomfortable. Did we go through the wrong door? !! You've GOT to acknowledge your arrivals within 15 seconds! --Two servers (possibly also managers/owners?) for the entire dining room (8 tables?) knew their menu and ingredients, but the stuff of service was left behind --$10 corkage (BYOB) means cork removal and first pour only. practice your sommelier wine bottle posture and pouring technique because YOU WILL HAVE TO POUR GLASS REFILLS YOURSELF.  IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FOOD?... I can overlook almost any bad service if the food is fantastic, but... --Lamb Samosa was BURNED, black and rock-hard on the bottom. Don't serve it, you lazy assholes! --fried egg was over-hard, crispy, and brown, not "runny and like-a-dressing" as described by our server. _EPIC_ FAIL! if you can't fry an egg, you should GET OUT OF THE FUCKING KITCHEN and bus tables where you belong. if you can't catch your cook's mistake at what is supposed to be one of the valley's finest eateries deserving of five stars, YOU SHOULD BE EXPEDITING SHIT from a Village Inn toilet to its sewer. --rib eye not trimmed, HUGE chunks of fat. if that's "marbling" then my cousin's 400-pound cottage cheese legs are STILTON. --rib eye ordered mid-well (my guest; of course, i would never order meat mid-well) arrived mid-rare. THEN the server argued about it. WWHHAATT??!! FUCK YOU. That is not "grey with a line of pink" IT'S FUCKING BLOODY PINK. --rib eye arrived an oily pile of uncut sauteed green onions and more. CUT THEM you lazy bastards. [see the pic for detail]   I went to Atlas Bistro after a year of prodding and reminders by others. I chose it for a reunion dinner that comes only every few years (the last one was celebrated at Kai). We were sorely disappointed. Note to self: when it matters, _always_ try a place first, no matter the recommendations or yelper reviews.

Frank S.'s honest, down-to-earth style, long history in the Phoenix community and great prices are what keeps me sending my colleagues and acquaintances his way.  You won't find him amidst the oneupping dealers on Camelback trying to outdo each other with blow-up signs and false advertising. No hidden tricks or lemon shenanigans, just straightforward, honest and no-pressure deals.  Check out his new covered parking lot. Those are (going to be) solar electric panels on top!

Bianco's is the best marketing ploy in the city, well except the Powerball. It is no wonder it consistently makes number one on the Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit) list. It should be taught as an example in Economics 101. How could seating for 30 at a time translate into a nationally famous restaurant?  Before I get to the nitty, let me make my disclaimer so all you potential flamers can chill and just move on your merry way. I don't wait. I want a reservation. I prefer an invitation by my host with RSVP. Bianco's is yet another example of our consumer need to suffer (see review of Los Dos) "Seinfeld-style" -- if you haven't seen the Chinese restaurant episode, you've got to; you can easily satisfy your need for suffering and you don't even have to leave your couch or wander far from your clicker.  I love Bianco's pizza. It truly reminds me of eating in Naples and what pizza is like from that region. I mean before their landfills filled up -- DON'T go to Naples now. There is no other place in Phoenix to taste this kind of pizza. I just wish someone could execute it better -- his wife?  Oh wait. I forgot; it already is the hottest restaurant in town. Why would they change a fantastically successful equation? Consumers consume. You want to find out why you have to wait 3 hours. You want to do it yourself. So does every tourist coming here to be surprised that Phoenix actually has paved roads and that we drive cars on them. They've booked their jeep tours from their suburban cookie-cutter somewhere far away, but don't realize that it's an hour drive to the desert. Yeah, you know that was you.  Do I have to remind you that you have to arrive at Bianco's an hour before the restaurant even opens to wait in line to put your name on the list to then wait next door for 3 hours to get a table? You will still have to wait because large parties get to eat ahead of you. I have to wonder. Would this place be so famous if they had seating for 100-120 like most other successful dining rooms around town? Would folks still flock there to spend their ENTIRE evening waiting for a table?  I'll wait and see. I've already fulfilled my duty as consumer and subjected myself to the suffering that is Bianco's. I've done it. What's next? Who's going to provide my next packaged-up roller-coaster ride? Come on. Tell me! Are we there yet? Yet?

Durant's was the place I had to behave like I never behaved before to deserve. It was the place my grandparents went to meet their peers and friends. It was the place where we'd be interrupted countless times to be introduced to another person I'd never met. In days past, this truly was THE place to see and be seen.  But no more. You can still walk through the kitchen like one of the finger-to-nostril pressing patrons of old, but gone is the standard of service and of food. This USED to be the best martini in town, best steak in town, best crab cakes in town. But alas, no more.  It takes at least 3 visits for me to so drastically change my opinion of a former great star. My last three visits were filled with disappointments. No one knows who I am anymore. Normally this would be a narcissistic thing to say, except that my family in its generations has been dining there since it was first opened. For a steak place you'd think they'd have everything listed on the menu. For my first of three, I gave up after ordering 4 different steaks, all out of stock. I would have to settle for well-done prime rib -- something I leave for the unwashed and people who deserve to have old shoes served on their plates.  The wine list, although unabbreviated was sorely lacking. After 6 tries, all out of stock, I had to call sommelier (who also had no idea who I was) to finally just get me whatever he had left.  Vegetables and side dishes are reminiscent of Jay Newton's Beefeaters' lukewarm one-side-for-all frozen nastiness (think thick over or undercooked wavy cut carrots and faded blue-white cauliflower). Crab cakes have fallen from their former greatness to either being out of stock, or burned up and dry. Roquefort was also unavailable two of the last three times I was there.  Most service details were missed. I don't even want to go into the specifics for mourning of my memory of this place's former greatness. I do have to warn you, if you end up going, take your own napkin. They've changed linen vendors and napkins have that apron-or-dishrag-let's-starch-it-anyway smell to them. I give it two stars for respect of my memory of my grandfather and the gleeful twinkle in his eye to order the steak and lobster and to watch him enjoy every tasty bite.  Sorry, Durant's. You're on the outs. Tourists and unwashed only, and that's to keep the real estate values up for neighbors Switch and Wild Thaiger.

New chef, knowledgeable bartender GAIL, the finest quality beef, and professional staff make Durant's my recent favorite for swill, swank and STEAK.  --great late night dinner. seatings until 10:30, maybe later! --steak sliders only available from the bar --shrimp cocktail, huge and delicious --oysters on the half-shell, scrumptious --petit fllet, perfect every time --crab cakes not consistent, sometimes overcooked and dry --prime rib is juicy and luscious. don't miss the horseradish --horseradish will BLOW THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD OFF hot.  Gail knows her stuff. She'll take you on a trip down memory lane serving up all your Old Man old fashioned favorites from salty dog to boodles martini (yes, martinis are made with GIN _and_ vermouth which actually goes in the glass, you FAKERS!!) all the way to my own five-point manhattan (knob, dubonnet, up, twist, stirred). And at Durant's all drinks are stirred, the way they're supposed to be.  The decor hasn't changed since my last review -- indeed since 1962 -- except for the small street light sconces in the dining room, but they may have been there before too. Tradition.... Tradition. Fresh flowers every time, starlight star recessed ceiling lights and those red silk walls.  They don't call it atomic horseradish for nothing. It will blow the back of your head off. Please bring a net to catch it.

FRIENDS DONT let friends eat at tee pee.  I take it all back. THIS is the worst Mexican joint in Phoenix. And that dubyuh ate here elevates it to one star. He probably loved it. Why do you think it's called Tex mex?  "Green sauce" was this dirty water with floating spice leaves. UGH. Rice typically too much pepper, tomatoes not fresh, salsa not fresh, low-grade cheese blech.  Tables too small and on top of each other. First-generation mini blinds saggy, bent, filthy and old. Dingy wall kitsch includes glowy virgin, fake and faded plastic greenery. Add to it screaming children who at some point seem to be trying to outscream each other and you've got the essence of the ambiance which is Tee Pee.  Service is very friendly and staff is dedicated to keeping the dinner moving. If only the food were edible and the surroundings a bit fresher.

cash only ($1.50 ATM fee). chain concept from Vietnam. "mass-produced" baguettes ready "every 30 minutes" are not worth the trip.  $2.25 10" bologna salami and vietnamese veggies. what do you expect for $2.25?! great value... but i was hoping for better. --rancid pickle --rancid red onion --american cheese: think "cheap brand that wishes it were kraft singles" -- yeah, it was BAD --no oil in the house, no vinegar in the house. only mayo and mustard in the 0.02 oz packet.  lots of choices here... ice cream, wings, sandwiches... cheap, generic, flavored coffee syrups displayed like precious alcohol... WHAAT!?? maybe it's a cultural thing.  but all i wanted was a good baguette sandwich. what a shame! PASS!

Owner Daniel M. is one of my most favorite restaurateurs in Phoenix. His stamina and passion for the business of serving fine cuisine is a rare find. Daniel is from South America but you wouldn't know it; his knowledge of the secret kitchens of Tuscany, Umbria and Amalfi is uncanny. I know this because I traveled with him and his chef one year on their odyssey through Italy.  Daniel takes special pride in personally choosing a very select few bottles of wine to fit any budget. OK, it's not Etienne's Different Point of View's list of 4000, but know that any choice you make is going to be a good one. If you're not sure, just ask for Daniel and tell him what you have in mind -- likely he has (with a wink) a special bottle in the back.  When we traveled through the Italian countryside I was constantly astonished by the warm greetings and special invitations we had from local proprietors who shared with us exquisite homemade wines and dishes made with pride from the finest vegetables and livestock. We frequently stayed long past closing with the owners and into the night sampling rare port and grappa. At one restaurant in Orvieto the owner took us deep into the dank recesses of the wine cellar for a special sampling  of cheese and wine. Talk about knowing people? One afternoon while drinking our 5th bottle of wine, who walks by but Jan D'Atri! Wow. (That's another review.) And speaking of reviewers, I also ran into Phoenix Magazine's Nikki Buchanan (also extremely nice).  When Daniel first opened in this location with that little stone oven in the corner, it was a pizzeria and guests could belly up to long tables in a casual environment that was made easy by his banter with the heavy Italian accented waitress (name?) who made a comeback some years later. For quite some time the restaurant was Il Forno; that is until corporate giant Il Fornaio entered the fray and sued him to change the name. After much rigmarole he changed to aqua e sale -- and notice Il Fornaio has since closed its doors? LOL. Again after much hoopla, he made it Daniel's. The current wood-paneled decor makes me think of a city club in San Fran or London. Very posh, yet understated. Selections of sculpture and art from his travels dot the restaurant's three small dining rooms.  The menu is a very difficult one. I say that because it has all of your favorites and it is difficult to make your final selection. Great for steak, ravioli, the best carpaccio in the city, best buffala mozzarella, mmm.... I could go on and on. So does the menu, page after page.  Some might call the preparations simplistic. This is the Tuscan way. Simple ingredients and simple preparation. Let the ingredients make their own magic. Grilled rack of lamb is not drowned in some Smucker's lime jelly, but gently brushed with rosemary and garlic, tickled with salt and pepper and finished with a squeeze spray of lemon.  Unfortunately the artful one-of-a-kind plates and bowls handmade in Vietri chipped at the edges over the years and the health department made him throw them away -- UGH!! -- they were a beautiful motivation to make you lick your plate clean to see the painted pictures beneath your scrumptious dinner. Not that you needed an excuse to dab every last bit of sauce with the wonderful mini loaves of bread cooked right there in the hearth that started it all.  Daniel himself is a wonderful host. He loves to give his guests a wonderful experience. There are many choices for Italian food in Phoenix. Most of it is just American Italian. Daniel's is a unique touch of the simple yet elegant. Enjoy.  P.S. [post edit] OMG. How could I forget the Tiramisu? It's a generous portion, so you can share with your guest, but after your first bite you may not want to. Light and airy, yet fantastically flavorful, the quality of the coffee really makes this dish a reason to go back again and again. I'm not going to tell you the secret ingredient. You'll have to ask Daniel.

FIVE STARS FOR FAKERS. Pretentious "And for the gentleman...?" crap. Poor preparation, poor execution. No discipline.  Be sure to include your taxidermy viewing preference in your reservation.  FOOD --FANTASTIC wine list covers two facing 11x17 pages. Only redeeming quality; --some ingredients are spot on, but their preparation is little better than home town buffet. Kitchen needs a kick in the pants; --Steak Oscar with squash and zucchini. Asparagus Costco-style: huge, totally bland and almost raw. Squash was the same: "tarragon butter" = Imperial Margarine. --8 oz filet mignon "rare" came mostly medium rare... hard to get it wrong when it's that small. --Crab and Lobster bits were good, but lacked preparation as if they were thrown at the dish. Fennel was a poor choice for seasoning. --creme brulee was barely brulee, creme was like cheese, it was that firm. fresh berries were nice, but I can get those from AJ's too! Come on! --presentation is _always_ off. How much am I paying for this again? expediter should be FIRED (pun intended). --an 8-top is the hardest to get the kitchen timing right. ours was all wrong (my rare filet was almost cold).  REALLY GETTING PISSY --I hate restaurants who can't design a menu layout. what's with the 24x36" poster boards? --most staff are speaking the etiquette, but their actions and the details are missing (see below);  SERVICE DETAIL --I don't want to know our server's name, and I especially don't want his business card placed in front of me before I leave. (Ooh, maybe I should have looked at the back side of it.  Whoops.) --Enough with the "and for the gentleman". After the third time I wanted to say, "The gentleman would like you to stop addressing him like that," in response. Stop! --some of us ordered sparkling water and received our Pelegrino, but then the water boy filled all of our glasses with tap anyway. Ding. --poor quality linen. Maitre'D changed white napkins to black for dark-slackened colleagues, but they are starched and still smell of the dishrags they were washed with. --server/sommelier should _not_ hold a folded black napkin to the side of a wine glass as he pours. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? --many servers wore waistcoats (vests) over white aprons, but the vests were unbuttoned. Poor form! (all that's missing is the flair) And the aprons were mostly filthy -- what are they, cooks, too?  AMBIANCE --marched me between ridiculous faux copper lions and among the worst copy of Frank Lloyd Wright-style block pillars I have ever seen. You should be ashamed of yourselves! --WHY would I want to have a 15-foot painting of Barry Goldwater glaring down at me? I don't. --I also can't stand mounted dead animals' heads. It's a deal breaker.   OTHER --Ha! HA! The '96 Chateau Lafitte Rothschild is retailing here for $950. I got mine at $110 each. NICE! --glassware is correct, excellent choices. always presented the correct glass for the correct beverage. --our table was right next to the kitchen, so I got to listen in on the cooks' complaints and vacation plans in Spanish. not so much. --food runners almost collided as they rushed across the dining room; maybe that's why their aprons are so dirty.  Just forget it. CERTAINLY not worth the $$$$ ($100pp)

First visit: Food poisoning. The scallop appetizer gave the two of us that shared it food poisoning on Saturday. Not one to go to the hospital unless there's blood or pus, just waited it out, wretching most of the day on Saturday and spent the last several days recovering. The owner was very nice when I called and he offered to take special care of us next time, but my fellow diners are not inclined to take him up on the offer, nor am I.  Service not coordinated well -- cleared silver with empty plate, but forgot to bring more, two servers stopped and asked the same question, server brought another table's appetizer to ours (wishing he'd taken our scallops to another table!).  Service details not correct -- only have red wine glasses, no visit from manager during entree, no offer for additional drinks.  Done well: busers are on it! water always full, plates and silver promptly cleared, unobtrusive, unhurried, courteous, smelled good, and especially, knew how to place the napkin in my lap for me when I sat down.  Food mostly unimpressive. Besides the poisonous scallops, the vegetarian angel hair pasta in "balsamic sauce" was vinegar water which made the pasta and other julienned veggies float like soup in the bowl. The two sauces of the scallops did not compliment each other or the scallops, and except for their contrasting color didn't do much for me (besides making me violently ill later).  Ambience: I loved the long table against the wall stacked with varying height and colored candles, all alight. I also liked the very large "wine" room for larger groups. Exposed floor and tabletops made it feel casual while cloth napkins and lighting dressed it up. I'd suggest doing something to break up the ceiling a bit, perhaps dropped ceiling panels or drapery or other uplit side lighting. Won't be back.

I am a movie WHORE. I've rated 2500 movies on Netflix. I used to wait in line for the midnight premieres. Camelview holds some very special memories for me. if it's sheik but not on the AMC, daddy warbucks studio fatheads' approved list, it might get a chance at the Camelview. Now of course we have Netflix, but some of those jewels deserve a proper screen. Thanks to Dan for making it happen.  Enchanted April Much Ado About Nothing (saw it about 40 times in the theater) The Joy Luck Club Pi Amelie Madness of King George Remains of the Day  Counter service is sketchy, but as the years go by, so come and go the pimply teens on their first jobs. Now if only we can break the ratings board. If you haven't seen it, check Unrated.

Sip your cup-o-joe in the former mechanic's bay of this historic gas station turned hip coffee house by my gradeschool friend, Bill Sandweg. Bill and his wife bring their years of restaurant management and service experience to this delightful addition to the 7th Avenue neighborhood. The pastries are home made.  You've no excuse to escape your work either. Free wi-fi is just a couple of clicks away. The close quarters of the former garage make for easy conversation with strangers, now new acquaintances about politics, Ev Mecham or even your most recent Yelp review.  Take advantage of the drive-thru, Starbucks-style as you drive past the antique gas pumps out front. All told, it's a great stop, and you can support another wonderful local business.  Four stars 'cause they close at 9pm (as of the writing of this review). I wanna hang out Tempe-Coffee-Plantation style like in my ASU days.  Thanks, Bill.

Fun and good value happy hour. But there are just too many places within a half mile that are doing the same thing and doing it better.   Makes me think of the divey old pookies... A place where you don't go for food, but good company and tasty beverages.  ...and a drag show (if that's your thing).  ## the scrambled egg special with jalapeños and peppers was dead and overlooked. DEAD.  Think: chafing dish, serving spoon and steam table. Ugh.   Small details missing, reflected everywhere including the kitchen. Stop trying so hard, just get good at a few things and let the booze do the rest.  # water glass chipped # bits of dried food on the silverware # gents' door sticky enough that somebody might think it's occupied # seating upholstery is worn, cracked and tattered # wall to wall kitsch not dusted recently # staff congregates at the host stand chatting and leaning I'm not supposed to care because you don't.  But I do. It means you don't care about my food. And it shows.   ## open face tamale is not a tamale, it's a hot mess. Stop calling that mushy pile of barely-cooked masa a tamale.  # queso sauce is a wet mess (I'm always wary when the menu has to change languages from English to convey the description). Glad I asked for it to be left off.  # nothing made to order. It's just a lazy kitchen with squirt bottles and chafing dishes doing nothing well. MEH!!  What a shame.  Maybe if they add a drag show I'd be back sooner than later.  So far it'll be later.

FATTY, "ANTIBIOTIC-PUMPED-TO-KEEP-ME-ALIVE, STOOD-IN-MY-OWN-POOP-'TILL-THEY-SLAUGHTERED-ME" _FEED LOT_ "MEAT". WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY'S MEAT???!!!  -- sure, on Wing Tuesdays they may be only $0.45 each, but the gristle, fat and squish they call "chicken" is barely swallowable. -- "Beef" ribs are little more than fat on a bone, slathered with sweet sauce. ICK. SEND IT BACK!! -- kitchen never on time. When your server stops by to say your food is on its way, that means at least 10 more minutes. -- limited beer selection -- bag salad mix sprinkled with bag shredded cheese and bag croutons. ugh.  sure they sell their 12 sauces in take-home bottles, but if they're cutting corners so heavily on the meat, just imagine what choices they're making in the sauces. BLECH!  Corporate quality gone amok.

BEST CARNE ASADA (GRILLED SLICED STEAK), HACIENDA-STYLE HOSPITALITY. A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE.  --colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail; --dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above; --this place and the adjacent ranch market are a "must-do" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);  --Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one "portion" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference; --grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows); --both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans; --juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; "asada" goodness knows no bounds; --guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!! --table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn; --try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas. --no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)  --pork was a bit dry; is "gamey" possible in pork? --server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.  After so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!  If you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.  Don't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town. Take your camera.

Insist on Eugene at the Sushi bar. Accept no substitute. Wait, gamble (with your money), or come back another time. Trust me. Otherwise it'll be dicey, as in you'll take your chances (with your cuisine).  Hats-off to my young but talented sushi chef, EUGENE. Giving my third AND FOURTH star for his expert technique and skill, uniquely and traditionally elevated/formal Japanese (and I mean, DAMN traditional) style. You are an asset to this place, sir! Domo Arigato Gozaimashte Eugenesan!  --small, traditional japanese-sized nigiri, not American all-you-can-eat-two-bites-per-piece --excellently crafted seaweed wraps. (is he bringing in his own? because... see below) --veggies for salmon skin roll _cut_to_order_. Now _that's_ fresh. --tamago rice served inside the egg, not under it. Crafty! --blood-red maguro, my absolute favorite. --natto roll. you bet they have it. cut roll had no juicy strings. (that means he stirred it exactly the correct number of times)  My usual but quick scan of the display showed that Tuna was the fish to order today. I was not disappointed.  Normally given the choice, I'll choose the seat in front of the senior chef. Today, the gods were with me and my instinct to choose his junior chef was well rewarded.   I say _INSIST on Eugene_ because from what experienced the next day from the senior chef, I wouldn't even be writing this review. He's just lost his passion. ...  # rice falls apart with every nigiri as i pick it up. i mean even before it even makes it to my soy sauce -- and i'm no noob (newbie) --- Note: you cannot hand back a dish of nigiri to the senior chef in front of him and his junior chefs. If you do, you must immediately leave the restaurant. Instead you just have to stumble through every piece, hoping that they're noticing that every piece is crumbling. You got it, I stumbled through every last $7 piece. (hana oh hana, i can't wait to get home) And you got it again, no one took notice, and no one apologized, nothing. What an humiliating spectacle! --- # all-you-can-eat-two-bites-per-piece is appreciated at $12-14 for two pieces, but I want the masterful technique from yesterday. it ends up being sashimi with a pick-up-pile of rice now busted and all over my plate (see above) # rolls thrown together, not even packed. no care. what a disappointment. # seaweed has been exposed to humidity and air and is not the crispy "fresh" and dry i expect when sitting at the bar. EPIC fail.

the view, oh the view. as the magic hour of sunset approaches and the valley glows from the setting sun, there is no better place to enjoy a tasty beverage and slurp oysters off the half shell than on the 106th floor of the stratosphere tower.  --server Deborah won't lead you astray. attentive, warm and professional service. spot on! --maitre'D Santino welcomes you and makes you feel like an old friend come home to your club's dining room --live music and the bustle from the lounge above float down to keep the right atmosphere going  --head for the up elevator early so you can wander and shop through the mall on your way to the tower --hang on tight, 'cause that elevator swooshes! #107 lounge service is sporadic and scripted, don't bother. --tiered dessert cart slowly passes you as you spin by, tempting you with delight. the sign says, "for display only" darn it!  --oysters on the half with all the trimmings; atomic, lemon, cocktail sauce, tart red wine and beet string salad --turf and quack. a trio of favorites. prime filet, perfectly grilled, pepper cress and luscious reduction seared fois gras atop delectable sweet potato mash, and duck breast, sliced and with its own sweet sauce presentation was a bit off, seemingly rushed --creme brulee with berries.  tower restaurants on the spin can easily leave you feeling alone and abandoned with just inches between you and the glass, but not so with this team. server Deborah and manager Santino were on it! Thanks for a wonderful evening!

Harley's is always a mixed bag, but a locally-owned one. Never stellar, your chances for a great meal are stymied by some really poor choices in cheap ingredients.   --great spot to chill, chat and a cheap Chardonnay. --eccentric service makes for a wildcard every time (could be good or bad)  --garlic bread little better than the "garlic bread to go" special at the supermarket checkout endcap as an impulse buy --the bag salad mix (also available from "pick your store"), --pool of olive oil for dipping. --wine selection is a bit off with nothing that is really special. --Alfredo usually bland, but thankfully can be thickened with as much Parmesan as you want. --Shrimp Diablo sometimes risky, shrimps usually cooked perfectly, but sometimes overdone.  --Glass tops over maroon linens shows corner-cutting philosophy and makes me nervous. (It's entirely different at Persian Garden where I know those linens under glass are precious.)  Having said all that, I'd choose Harley's any day over Christo's or the chains-that-shall-not-be-named.   Least important is the rich history of this place. Just about the only thing remaining from the old days is the front door which is no longer used.  Originally "Livia's" it was considered one of the best Italian places in town. Given, that was before Mary Elaine's woke us up with a jolt to the possibilities of cuisine. Changing appetites and consumer tastes baffled the former owners and the place went Roman Table until Phoenix Light Rail wiped bars Harley's and Harley's Too from the Camelback Corridor at 3rd Avenue.

...should be renamed Tata's Latas (Grandpa's tin cans, loosely)  I don't care that it's on Mayo boulevard and I don't care if Westcor or whoever runs this area thought it'd be a cute addition to the restaurant choices guaranteed to survive an economic downturn, Abuelo's should be named Tata's Latas (Grandpa's tin cans, loosely). I don't believe that any of the food is home made. It's all processed crap.  I should have taken a hint from the menu with pictures. ANY place that has to show you a picture to sell you a dish of food should simply send you running for the exit door. But I was lunching with colleagues and was a rider not a driver, so I was stuck with pried latas and ziplock.  I ordered a Dos Equis lager and flour tortilla chips for the table salsa (I'm allergic to corn, quite the differently-able-ness -- oh, damn, it's HANDICAP -- when going to a Mexican restaurant). The beer arrived in a 1/4" thick goblet. Didn't take me long (but thankfully before my first sip) to notice the fruit fly floating in my beer, and despite its thickness there were chips along the rim of the glass.  The menu was clearly filled with sweet sauces and other colorful darker but still sweet sauces (and you had the pictures to assure you). I haven't seen this many sauces (all obviously from 5gal jugs like that ranch dressing you buy from the Price Club) since I mistakenly visited a Roy's. (Are there any still open?) But I made my way to the freshestly described menu item that I could (had no picture) and then explained to the server to omit the corn kernels, colored corn chip strips, corn tortilla chips, and corn flakes. I also ordered the $6.00 side serving of guacamole.  Had I not been with colleagues, the resulting exchange with the general manager when my food arrived would have been something worthy of a youtube video. The guacamole had bits of avocado amidst a lime-green gluey gunk that had been squirted from a tube. The flour tortilla chips were at least a year old, but they had a very firm texture... no chance these'd break off in the too-thick dipping sauces described by another yelper. The table salsa was straight from the can, puree style; no flavor, no texture, and strangely bright red given its blandness. The crowning insult to cuisine was in the composition of my main dish.  The Insert-Meaningless-Spanish-Word Salad was atop a pile of shredded taco lettuce. Per my meat selection, it featured globs of canned chicken squishy with something resembling a salty sweet Teriyaki sauce, no doubt thickened with corn starch. Add to this a scoop of the normally-a-side-dish red bean soup which was probably pretty good on its own; the bean mixture had bits of something like ground beef. Atop the beans were shreds of orange and white "cheese", some of which had melted into the beans, but were almost crispy on their own. I won't even presume to call them cheddar and jack; no chance. All this was topped with a layer of nacho cheese goop. Processed shredded yet treated-to-survive-the-shelf-life bits of green chili which were effing hideous. Ringing the plate were the same bland and terribly old yet very firm tortilla chips. Atop the cheesy sauce were bits of diced tomato, the only thing that could have been fresh; but the more I thought about it, I realized that these could have been delivered in a ziplock, same as everything else I'd seen.  I'm told the huevos rancheros with beans was an excellent dish, but it is no longer on the menu. I'd rather have Baja Fresh!

fantastic for purists, NIRVANA for culinary adventurists. MUST HAVE RESERVATION.  (note: first-visit-only impression) --tuna sashimi, best in class. absolutely top. --salmon sashimi, just doesn't get much better unless it's still wiggling. --yellowtail sashimi, wonderful variety of texture, even in a single bite. --don't even think of going without a reservation; you'll be on the patio (parking lot)  otherwise. --didn't bring my platinum card this time; could easily rack up $600 next time (but if you're an adventurist, it's the best thing going without a trip through Sky Harbor) --service this visit was horrifying, could be a fluke.  Since I had no reservation and was on the patio after a bit of a fuss, and with the tiki torches blowing their smoky fumes and ash in our general direction, I was not prepared to make the investment that this place demands. It could also have been when the giant pink Mary Kay Cadillac pulled up; not even the Caddy keys could get them a table.  Not going after service misses 'cause the runner really tried hard to make up for the mistakes. I'll hope for five stars next time when I take my Amex Platinum.

Neighborhood spot with great prices, but hit and miss fish. I prefer a sure thing.  --excellent yellowtail tells me the potential is there, perhaps i have to be a regular to get the good stuff because  # ikura made me want to vomit # tuna, salmon sashimi fishy, not fresh (this is why people don't like sushi... 'cause they haven't had good fresh fish) # masago not fresh # Tamago not tightly folded, seaweed wrapper not crispy and dry  if only i could have had more pieces like that yellowtail!

Typical (poor quality) bar food. Stick to stuff which comes out the tap. I don't mean water. Great party spot for green day.  --super friendly staff, always helpful and accommodating --great alternative to four peaks, across the parking lot --big-screen prominently featured for great event viewing --soda bread filling and yummy  --irish breakfast all-day, pig fodder. Come with snout and knee pads if you want it. Better served in trough from a tin pail.  --over easy eggs served over DEAD, crispy brown, yolk as if hard boiled --sausage dry, days old reheated reheated reheated. Yeah you know how it goes. --black and white potatoes dry lumps  --new flatbreads interesting but with a kitchen making so many mistakes, you might get charcoal. --patio seating without noise cancellation phones and individual wireless mics makes conversation impossible against the roar of frontage, 30 feet away.

"Too many notes!" In this case too many courses, too many ingredients, too many everything. It's no wonder they lost track of my corn allergy and could have killed me -- what a disappointment.  THE GOOD --large but not daunting wine list with excellent selections --Riedel crystal, including the beautiful decanters --barman extremely knowledgeable, flawless execution in every respect --_REAL_ Luxardo Marasche cherries imported from Italy for your Knob (Creek) Dubonnet Manhattan. oh DAMN! --Chef Kevin himself at the window to finish and present every last dish that goes out (but see below) --every course an intricate four- or six-play of subtle sophistication  THE BAD --cram every dish of every episode of Top Chef into a single evening; --HUNDREDS of ingredients across 15+ courses, 3 bites each... --I can't skim an encyclopedia in four hours either, DAMMIT! --crowded dining room means close quarters for all, especially the staff --staff's rehearsed scripts of courses' ingredients and preparations played out like an old 8-track which woobles and laarrlls distortedly from endless repetition  THE UGLY --but amidst the pageant of amuse bouche after amuse bouche, course after course, despite my phoning in, reconfirming with every bloody server and manager about my allergy, THEY SERVED ME CORN FLAKES!!!! BLOODY MOTHER OF G. D. EFFING H. E. DOUBLE TOOTHPICKS!  Did Chef think I would not notice? Did Chef even care? I must presume that they were not purposefully trying to kill me, so it has to be that the staff and the kitchen just can't keep track of it all. Don't forget that there are one thousand effing ingredients in play in each diner's meal, let alone that it says bloody CORN ALLERGY all over the effing ticket! I trusted you, Chef, and you disappointed me. And you didn't even come out yourself to take responsibility for it, you jerk!  Unfortunately I could not enjoy any of the courses which followed. I was just too damn paranoid. I gave up and asked for the corny check.  EPILOGUE I hope you can believe me when I say that I have been _dreading_ this review for weeks. It could be that my experience was just a fluke. My story is but a single snapshot. Who am I to pass judgment on such elegant art? Especially art for which Chef has obviously spent years of disciplined study and exploration.  A restaurant's sole business should be the sale of delight. Instead I left paranoid and confused. And I left having paid several hundred dollars for it! Good bye, nurse!  Unfortunately, I must concur with my esteemed colleague Ted S.: Binkley's challenges the limits of culinary excess and does so outside the bounds of its own ability to deliver. Two stars. Seven dollar signs.

excellent selections of wine flights, amusingly named. assorted cheese tastings to accompany.  --wine cellar fridges are a delight to explore; filled with mid-'80s french reds in magnums and double magnums. paradise just a pane of glass away. (does a yelp review count as pre-meditation?) --delightful barman loves wines and loves to talk about them with you. --"sparkling" flight a refreshing pick-me-up after some hours of crap shoots --soft cheese selection with dried fruit and --basketfuls of salty if spongey thick-sliced bread #even sitting at the bar, the casino's throng of never-ending C-major-chord dinging relents not

Do you love extra mozzarella cheese? If you do, this place is exactly what you're looking for. Do you wish you could tell the pizza delivery dispatcher just how much cheese you'd really like on your pizza, but don't because they'd have to charge you for six toppings to get it right? Do you carefully separate the cheese from the pizza crust telling your companions it's the only good part anyway? Is the Mac in your home made Mac 'n Cheese just an afterthought? Are you from Wisconsin?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Nick's at Pinnacle Peak is your dream come true. Have a look at my pictures if you don't believe me. Baked ziti, barely visible under the gooey excellence of all that cheese. Chicken parm which is just an excuse as a flat object to pile on more cheese.  This Nick's is sit-down style with a full bar to whet your whistle with whatever you wish. The service was a bit slow, but entertainment is provided by people picking up furniture self-serve style from the suite next door. I went for lunch so the full-south facing windows without treatments made for a bit of glare, although the extra sun made my gobs of mozzarella glisten. Yeah, baby!  My companion ordered a soup and salad, and was pretty hungry after; the soup cup was small enough to be called demitasse. Not for the Hungry Man in your party.  A very unique experience, one to share with your cheese-lovin' friends.

Upscale ambiance, big-band tracks, excellent bar, but this is a steakhouse and mine was dry, flavorless and looked like a cow pie.  --kudos for stocking Dubonnet Rouge, my favorite; though shaken to oblivion, Manhattan was pretty damn good! --absolutely _EXCELLENT_ Ceasar salad. i haven't had it that good in YEARS! was that a hint of a hint of anchovy in the dressing? marvelous! --why the hot-as-cattle-iron main dish plates? you bastards BRANDED my tongue on my first bite into those potatoes! my food KEEPS COOKING on the plate when it's that hot! that's why... --the shrimp scampi was overcooked to "bullet-hard", first AND second try; second try they were salt-licks too salty. I AM NOT A COW! --first attempt 6 oz "100 percent prime beef 100 percent of the time" (really?, come on) was dry, flavorless and looked like a cow pie on my plate; --second attempt 6 oz filet was juicier, but had horrible overtones of liver. did you think i wouldn't notice, YOU BASTARDS?!  Despite my being a phoenix native, this was my first ever visit to D's. Servers go through the motions, but lack the sense of pride and _genuine_ hospitality befitting a place of this stature. Instead they bumble about, not communicating with each other; their whole rehearsed routine crashing down if you don't "moo" exactly when you're prodded.  I am terribly disappointed by the kitchen. "Second-try" kitchen retribution is grounds for blacklist. Fire someone!

A WELCOME ADDITION TO UPTOWN. SWANK UPSCALE URBAN DECOR WITH INDUSTRIAL MIXED-MATERIALS HIGHLIGHTS. SMALL MENU, SMALLER WINE "LIST", BUT EVERY ITEM EXECUTED VERY WELL. Just weeks after the launch, it's already a very special place.  --Valet-only parking. --Retro woven-lattice fencing guides you to the front entrance --mixed-materials design is literally a full checklist of every single one: concrete, gravel, plastic, steel, glass, brick, stone, copper, negative space and more. Quite the hodgepodge but it worked for me. --garage-door wall straddling the bar keeps the addicted included and will make for more airy goodness when the weather cools. --don't miss the heirloom spoons set in concrete just inside the front door; they're on the menu too! --counter bar seats 4 and looks into the kitchen, chef's-table style  --seafood soup. mussels melt in your mouth, fish blocks for texture, shrimps and brothily delicious mirepoix. Cheesy crouton island demonstrates exactly what that table bread is for! I WIN AGAIN! --steak and its luscious reduction are for pepper lovers --crispy fingerling potatoes have a wonderful organic and natural feel and flavor as if straight from the garden. avail as app or with the steak --goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce app served with crispy thin slices of the freshly-made bread --fig and cheese flatbread app is a pillowy goodness of moist delight. sets a new standard. --table bread follows the Italian bent. no butter here, just oil. --Riedel glassware makes any wine pop! Takes the meal to a very very high level of sophistication and pleasure. StF does it right! --Meringue snaps and strawberries dessert.

SINGING COOKS ALWAYS MEANS SAVOR! SERVICE STAFF TREATS YOU LIKE EXTENDED FAMILY JOINING FOR A GREAT FAMILY MEAL. DECOR A BIT DRAB, BUT THIS PLACE HAS POTENTIAL!!!  --made-to-order Pico de Gallo is fresh and spicy, but too salty, especially if you eat with corn chips. --when you can hear cooks singing in the kitchen, you KNOW it's going to be good. --flour tortillas, though delivered, had only SIX ingredients. --guacamole should _never_ have a thickener like milk --rice too small, so it dried out fast, too bad. --cheese crisp not crispy, green chili strips were fresh!  DECOR NEEDS A REDRESS --long strands of hanging beer flags don't make a place festive unless they're flapping in the wind at a Mexico beach bar --nor do mounted mariachi hats and diagonally-stapled multicolor throw rugs --caballeros and damas are great, but don't mount McDonald's-plain Men and Women signs underneath. --mirrored walls are '80s. EW.  must qualify my review by mentioning my corn allergy. means I can't eat much from this menu. great local feel here, needs a facelift.

Horribly slow service, empty restaurant, salty broth, EXCELLENT live oysters  --server didn't know the menu. Not seeing a "raw bar" platter, I asked for it, was rebuffed and then saw "raw bar" options in the separate drinks menu --the live oysters were awesome. So tasty! --restaurant is cavernous but there is no one dining here.   Go try the oysters.

NYE specials out of this world! Best steak in the universe. ===  So we're wandering the endless halls of Caesar's looking for a spot to chill for several hours before the countdown begins. The halls are a bustle of screaming children and many people. The host stand and its tailored dude greet you alongside the display menu and a few tables out in the mall for the noisy customers. The real restaurant is back two rooms behind the bar and is like a secret treasure room for the deserving. We were lucky!  The NYE special surf and turf themed card included jumbo stone crab claws (4), king crab legs, 3lb lobster and a "side" of 8oz filet mignon. I won't say which one I didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the stone crab claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. Add to that a special price on the Tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.  The bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and Parmesean lahvosh. Stuffed mushrooms were excellent.  The service was prompt and professional and I loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun. The menu tells the story of the restaurant, founded in Florida, and I remember it well; this location honors the original in proper Vegas style.

A sushi bar has to earn my respect. First pass is a quick look-through of the fish in the display. I try to be unobtrusive about it so I don't look like a tourist, but if it's stacked up and already cut, or if I see a big vat-o'-spicy-tuna-with-mayo, or a microwave on the back counter, I'll just flee, or I'll order California roll.  Second pass is to throw down the gauntlet to the sushi chef. A triple-whammy order of tuna, fresh salmon and yellowtail sashimi. Typically this order will cost between $30 and $40, so it had better be the goddam best the chef has to offer. Kojisan did not dissapoint. Either later in my first visit or on my second when we had dropped the pretense, he stuck out his chest and beat it with a quick head nod to say he took pride in vanquishing my challenge with ease. It was at least as good as the finest fish I've ever had in the valley (cut and served by Sushi on Shea's KING of the Valley, "Fred"-san).  Now, I have spent the last 10 years at Ayako, and over those years, I developed a scale of sushi that is "worth eating". At the lowest level there is "good", then "very good", then "excellent". And at the very top is "life changing". Ayako was always very good, usually excellent, and sometimes if you're lucky, life changing. Hana is always excellent and very often is life changing.  Now I realize this seems to be a lot of hoopla about a piece of fish, right? I mean, come on. But if you're a serious sushicon (connoisseur), you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know some supersnob sushicons won't look at it unless if's alive just before you eat it. Yeah, that's pretty much a life-changing experience every time, but hey, this is PHOENIX, for god's sake.  The third pass is the whole, deep-fried ama-ebi (sweet shrimp). This is a test of their tempura batter, knowledge of just the right size of shrimp, how to prepare it (which pieces of the shell to remove), and of the simplicity in preparation. The resulting presentation can seem scary to the unwashed. Two big eyes are staring up at you, tentacles sticking every which way, now crispy and yummy, and my final squeeze of lemon completes it. The "brains" are the best part.  The fourth pass is if they know how to make a proper tamago (cold egg, crepe-like thing). It's fluffy like pastry, and it has seemingly thousands of layers upon layers, folded over and over like the finest katana. Once again, Kojisan presented some of the finest tamago I have ever tasted.  The fifth and final pass is the hardest to fulfill. Natto is fermented soybean, which when potent smells like the nastiest stinky socks you've ever experienced. Most American sushi bars won't serve it because it's just too offensive to nearby diners. Those that do serve a toned-down mild version that is like a strong cheese. Natto is best served stirred with soy sauce and topped with the yolks of quail eggs, sprinkled with finely cut dried seaweed. As you are ready to eat it, dump it over a piping hot bowl of rice and devour. Wanna guess if Hana serves it?  The service at Hana is edgy. Service uniform is hip, and like most sushi bars, the staff freely yell at one another across the dining room. Although Kojisan keeps the A/C on in winter to flush out loiterers, and even though multiple busers swoop down after your last bite to clear your empty plates, you'll have to wait 45 to 70 minutes at prime-time on prime nights to be seated. This can be awkward in the small corner of the front part of the restaurant without glaring at other seated customers, willing them to get the heck out of your seat so you can sit down. Arrive before 6:40 or after 9:10 if you loathe the wait.  Please don't try this restaurant. And please don't tell other people about it. There's just not enough room for us all.  LOL. Enjoy.

SETS THE STANDARD FOR JAPANESE FOOD OUTSIDE JAPAN. _DON'T_ MISS IT.  It's been a long time since my initial review of Hana. In fact it was one of my very first on Yelp. I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list, and those first visits did not fail to impress. I spoke about my personal scale of very good, excellent and life changing sushi. Indeed, Hana is always excellent, and i may say _usually_ life changing. Over the months Lori, Koji and family have shown me the the secrets of Japanese cuisine and the delight of specially-ordered ingredients, like:  -- real Japanese Kobe beef. -- live ama ebi -- live scallops -- live giant clam -- daikon delight -- zaruten soba -- miso ramen -- monkfish pate (ankimo) -- oysters on the half shell -- bento box delight -- hamachi kama -- natto maki -- hawaiian walu sashimi -- shima mackerel -- wild salmon  And that's just the specials. Hana SETS THE STANDARD for quality, every time in its -- Toro sashimi -- Fresh Salmon -- Maguro so red, i've heard it called beet red. -- Ika -- Tamago -- Seaweed Salad -- miso soup  And if you're feeling adventurous, many Americanized-craziness dishes abound for your culinary quest: -- Mt. Fuji roll -- Volcano roll -- Pride roll -- Lobster roll -- Hana roll  SERVICE has matured into an approachable and almost joyous pride to be able to share their food with their customers. Restauranting can be such a gritty grind, but Koji, Lori and the team present their carefully chosen ingredients with love and passion every day. Besides the excellent food, it is that passion which brings me back night after night, week after week.  I can see that despite my instructions against it, you all HAVE told your friends about Hana. Please stop spreading the news! There just isn't enough room for us all. LOL. Enjoy.  P.S.   Check out their website for social-network specials on Facebook and Foursquare. By the way, don't bother trying to oust me as Foursquare Mayor; it's a lost cause!

poor excuse for a Westcor pad occupant. See "Waiting" (the movie). Yeah, it's that place.  --grilled cheese sandwich looked like a brillo pad after three weeks' use (see my picture) --servers confused, unaware of their own menu --and that was just the content; they were filthy --service timings all off --soda syrups not properly proportioned  methinks it's the location. just stay away.

[I can't believe that I am the second person to review this restaurant. I may be the last; Mary Elaine's closes its doors for good sometime this month (Feb 2008). Perhaps I am the second person because a proper dinner for two (and I mean that that includes a _real_ selection from the best wine list in the city) will cost you $700 to $800, easily the cost of a coach ticket to Paris for the real thing. But make your reservations in advance. Dinner at Guy Savoy must be planned 4 to 6 weeks ahead. In case you don't realize it by the time you finish this one, I _AM_ a food snob.  I feel a very heavy burden here because Mary Elaine's has stood for everything I have hoped for in the finest of service and detailed preparation in a dining experience since I was a member of the Plaza Club, also now defunct. That I could presume to review this establishment and the professionals who take each and every part of their job as their personal quest in life is totally ludicrous. Instead of a review, I can at best present some of my fondest memories of this wonderful place. OK, Now that I have set the bar high enough for myself, let me begin.]  I can't remember if the team that comprises the army of staff that will serve you at front of house numbers 12 or 21 people, but by the time your dinner is over, you will have had a dinner to remember for the rest of your life.  Take your pick from one of two seatings, 6 to 6:45 or 8:30 to 9:15. Give the reservationist every last detail of your preferences. Some of my favorite requests: (1) seat me as far away from that wailing wanna-be Lisa Addeo who thinks she can replace Nancy Gee -- she's still singing the exact same songs in the exact same order she was eight years ago in the lobby. If I have to hear her make those Time-to-Say-Goodbye octave leaps one more effing time, I'm going to kill myself; (2) give us relaxed timing on the courses, we're in no rush; (3) my guest does not drink alcohol and is from Iran, find a formal drink for her that she will appreciate; (4) my guest loves Chateaubriand, could you scrape some up?  Among my most memorable experiences: The time Todd (manager) knowing my love of late 80's California cabs found a bottle of '88 Heitz Martha's Vineyard and surprised me for my birthday dinner. The time my guest surprised me by calling in and requested hot sourdough for my bread choice knowing how much I love it. The time our party sat at Chef's table in the kitchen and I watched first hand the quietest kitchen you can possibly imagine. The bottle of '62 Chateau Gran Larose that left my mouth black and from which I was still drunk the next day. My one and only ever sliver of Louis XIV cognac at $750 a slice. The way Nancy Gee used to sing Angel Eyes, my favorite. The time Sommelier Paul introduced me to the rasiney sweet pleasure of Lusteau Emilin cherry.  Mary Elaine's took pride in finding the most extravagant yet excellent ingredients in the entire world. It would not be uncommon for the special to include some extremely rare fish that had been flown in that afternoon. The wine list boasted 5000 bottles. Where else could you splurge on a $10,000 bottle of champagne? (The answer is Etienne's Different Point of View at Pointe Tapatillo Cliffs.) What if you feel like having a '60's bottle of Lafite Rothschild? Paul and his staff were always happy to oblige.  I'm talking about the subtleties of food preparation such that a single course may have but six or seven bites, but each of those is a symphony of tastes that overwhelms the senses. On my last visit, the sauce chefs had perfected their entries to each course to such an extent that their excellence sometimes overshadowed the main ingredients themselves.  It was fun to gulp my entire glass of water to see how many seconds it would take to be noticed and refilled (no more than 15).  Mary Elaine's celebrated what might be called a sacred relationship between a host and his guest. You will be missed.

--expensive for business lunch --servers very attentive, prompt --lacks nth-degree detail of a Japanese chef running things; rolls and standards are safe, but needs a ...san to show them how it's done --iced green tea is refreshing and plentiful. i had like 10 glasses.  sushi chef left my salmon skin pieces from the kitchen sitting on the pass for 10 minutes. server asked if she could bring me anything else and i had to point at the plate on the pass, now surely cold. it was.  spicy tuna mix was the standard gloop but at least did not have mayo.  tempura batter was gloopy not flaky and crispy like it should be. veggie pieces for tempura were too big and had cool centers. presentation lacked proper Japanese detail; straight from fryer to the plate, bits oil and all, carrot bits thrown at the plate. sauce was too thick for tempura and no white radish to be seen anywhere

meh. diner quality at master-chef prices. oh well, these are high rents up here i guess. no improvement since last time. see you guys in '17.  # no pride, no quality control. bits of food all over the place. - sunomono light and delightful # tempura sauce too salty # miso soup, bland, meh ## shrimp tempura undercooked, gooey inside  ### tried to serve me old re-roasted salmon skin. as if! dry, blackened, charcoal. HOW could you serve that, sir?!  Sent back. broiled a fresh batch second round, but still meh. they just don't even try.  where's the pride??!!  HEAD TO YUME SUSHI ACROSS THE STREET FOR A SOLID 4 STAR MEAL.  this place makes me wish there were a sixth yelp star so I could have one between 2 and 1. sushi brokers isn't scary enough, but also not even rising to a meh.

Beware. Run, do not walk from this restaurant. Never thought I'd say that about a restaurant, but the cook might be better as a garbage collector 'cause she did an excellent job scraping up the slimy gunk that might have formerly been lettuce on my club sandwich tonight.   Any recommendations for food poisoning ERs?

an epic adventure in americana ghetto wraithdom.  ok, so why would i be eating here and then admitting to it? well, downtown vegas has its own special ghetto charm. i wouldn't miss this for the world! we walk right in, no wait. i'm told this is unusual with a line frequently going outside and a 15-20 minute wait throughout the day. luck is with us!  --server's face sparkles with glitter make-up! FTW! --another server is lording over her busser, "...I make *more* than you! I make $9.50 an hour!" wow. --no blueberries, no chocolate chips. pancakes are popular today! chocolate batter pancakes are the pinch hitter. --eggs ordered over easy arrive over-rock-hard. nice! just like i ordered! --english muffin served with side of whipped butter on a piping hot plate... so the butter was a melted pool when i went to look for it. whaHAW! --tap water/ice has floaties! great surprises! --busser drops tray full of glass tumblers, sending shards of glass flying, and onto my table and booth. nice! --10 servers, 2 hosts, 2 cashiers, countless bussers and managers all chat lazily over their patrons. great vibe.  --pan handlers fight over us (fresh bait) as we walk the sidewalk. Mine! Mine! MINE!  Don't miss the $100-move-in/$300-per-week rooms for rent next door. the view of the sky through the caving roof is framed well through the gaping holes which used to be glass window panes. maybe there was a bomb test conducted there?  thanks for the memories!

Excellent AYCE (All you can eat) Value and prompt, friendly service. Fresh sushi is based on the volume you can push and how you can rotate your stock, and this place packs 'em in. For $25 (dinner AYCE includes more choices) it's no wonder.  I'm a purist. I don't do crazy rolls in which have gone the 2nd-day fish, drowned in eel sauce. Just the basics. For a place which specializes in rolls, i was pleased with the result. And I'm a fussy guy.  --uni nigiri. limit one. --ikura. fresh and good. --ika nigiri. soft, fresh. nice! --salmon skin hand roll. great fresh veggies. --hamachi kama. nicely seasoned, fresh. moist inside. WIN! --tako-uni. yeah, it's not really octopus, it's raw squid with extra crispy stuff. i love this dish. not for the unwashed. strong, dark and almost fermented, like a good natto. --seaweed wraps are fresh, dry, crispy, and great flavor. WIN!  #seaweed salad. something in there that shouldn't be. and it was not fresh.  servers are super friendly, responsive to all the obsessed AYCE gluttons. two sushi chefs keep that food MOVING to the 50-seats. (personal note: Kojisan@Hanajapanese, you would have been impressed!)  AYCE comes with rules, don't you know? ! all food ordered must be consumed (that includes rice) $1 penalty for uneaten nigiri. ! no take away. ! some items are one-per-person-per-visit ! your dining feast must end 90 minutes after you begin.

SLOWEST SERVICE IN PHOENIX, GREAT BLOODY MARY MIX, SALTY, STALE FOOD, WHAT A WASTE!  --EXCELLENT bloody mary, and for $2 special, Sat-Sun 11a-3p! One star (up from zero) for an excellent drink. THAT'S IT.  --walked in to find a customer at the podium waiting to complain about being abandoned at his patio table for the last 30 minutes --waited 15 minutes for our first round of drinks in the bar --when our party joined us and we sat, waited 10 minutes to have our drink order taken; --25 more minutes for our drinks to arrive (we insisted she take our order before leaving); --food arrived more than _one hour_ after ordering --the scrambled eggs were crusty and old, obviously made hours earlier; we were too hungry and pissy to send them back -- GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE! --the lobster bits and their sauce were nothing but salt! A salt lick would have been less salty.  --gratuity was automatically added (forced upon us) despite the delays, and with no apologies --no parking validations available; they said they "ran out". WHAT!!?  If I ever go back, I'll go straight to the bar and hope for quicker service on a Bloody Mary by itself. I probably won't.

I have made the round of the valley's dry cleaners, and Uptowne is by far the finest there is. Thankfully it is not as well known as some of the others, but it is the best. Know you are going to pay much more than the dollar-cleaner on the corner, but your clothes will last longer, and the special care Uptowne shows each and every one of your treasured pieces shows.  Got special buttons? They'll remove them before cleaning and replace them afterward. Replaced buttons and stain removal are all automatic. Special silk or wrinklable (is that a word) shirts? You'll find them stuffed with tissue paper on the hangar. Pressing is always done to the n-th degree and it has been extremely rare for me to find a mistake or problem.  If you have collectible pieces or are picky about your wardrobe, the only one to trust is Uptowne. I'll stake (and already have) my vintage Versace prints on it!

crap quick-bake pillsbury "baked to order". Croissant is NOT supposed to be gooey inside. Whatever expeller-pressed oil infused chemical it uses to achieve the "buttery" flakiness of the outer crust, you didn't fool me.  [this is my second attempt at this review. i would *swear* my april review with pictures was well placed, but it has since disappeared.]  I was so excited to try this place after reading the accolades and seeing some of the reviews here. I was sorely mistaken. echoing my bobblehead (and filtered) fellow-yelper's review, this place thinks *way* too high of itself. drop the attitude folks.  CROISSANT. # is not supposed to be gooey inside. it was for fakers.  POTATOES # margarine or expeller-pressed lube is the standard here. ugh. and to think we used to eat this stuff without blinking. for shame.  SERVICE. server keeps stopping at my table to see what else i want. every few seconds it seems. then they drop the check. before i asked. ok, i'm not going to fuss. unwilling to be shooed, i leave it. then she whisks it away, returning seconds later to scold me because there's no payment inside. OK OK I get it, I'm leaving!

best croissant and pain chocolat since paris. this is the real thing, folks! no. joke.  CROISSANT is supposed to be warm, airy, drippy, buttery, savory, crispy, flaky, crumby, messy, and just DAMN good. It should be so good, you can eat it plain. If you want to take it over the top, slather it with fruit preserves and drink with cafe longe or cappucino.  PAIN CHOCOLAT resembles the croissant, but hidden inside is a row of rich -- you guessed it -- chocolate.  Breakfast of the gods. No Joke.  My next browse will be to zillow.com to find a flat across the street from this bakery! I AM GOING TO MOVE to this patisserie!  Now, who can make me a proper baguette sandwich mixte avec crudite?!

Great mini grocery for imported English canned and jarred goods, but the food is bland, tasteless MEH!  --great selection of beers on tap --happy hour drink specials until 7pm --fun little mini grocery for your english junk food favorites and jarred Hayward and Coleman's products. --no-frills, drop-ceiling triple-wide strip-mall joint. No apologies, just solid English food...  But the food is BLAND. Tasteless, flavorless, boring MEH. There is a gigantic salt shaker nearby and you're going to need it!!  ## shepherd's pie arrives in black rectangular plastic bin, straight from the microwave. Sent straight back. Come on!  Is English food supposed to be so uninteresting? Give me a seasoned and panko-dusted piece of any fish, any day of the week over this meh crap.  What a shame.

Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS! Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.  --hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice --crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab --tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting --side salad for ciabatta "sandwich" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame! --chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese  Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist! Congrats, my lady.  If you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white.  Say hi to Joy. =)

Restauranting is not for the faint of heart. It takes grit, location, street-smarts, perseverance, flair, capital, wisdom, taste, charisma, luck, and most importantly, talent (many more, but this is a review, not a how-to for wannabes). As the owner, if you're lacking in any of these, you have to know it, and then have the humility to contract out to get the best. I really want to give Maizie's a chance: I've been there 5 times, but when it comes down to it, I have to remind myself that the reason I go to a restaurant is to EAT EXCELLENT FOOD. Unfortunately Maizie's fails to deliver in this most important category.  My first visit was amusing, but not impressive. I decided to test their reputation for good burgers. I like my meat juicy and red, so after discussing the preparation of the stuffed varieties, I settled on a cheeseburger with the cheese on top of it. Side of fries and nothing special there; typical flavored salt sprinkle you can get at Chili's.  Next time had the goat cheese pizza. I know that's not the real name, but after three bites, the power of the cheese covers everything else. I've heard of featured ingredients, but SHEESH! Next time was for snacks, so I got to enjoy the corner sofa and relax with a cocktail and the shrimp dippers. Nothing special.  Next visit I had this buffalo wing cheese thing, but without the chicken (it's supposedly ground up inside the cheese). Right. That's what I said too when I read the menu. It comes off like that midnight snack you throw together but don't care that you're missing the key ingredient, like cereal with orange juice or a peanut butter and mustard sandwich. In this case, missing the chicken wings, it was probably a can of tuna that "inspired" this recipe. The tureen of spicy cheese is served amidst a plate full of multi-colored (but not freshly made) corn chips and warmed pita triangles. Not enough of the pita breads, so we asked for more, but had to pay extra for them. (I hate that!)  The antipasto salad is served in a gigantic wooden salad bowl and really makes you feel like a pig to have it placed in front of you. I know you can prepare a salad in a bowl, but please serve it on a plate, and in a portion appropriate for the one person ordering it. Otherwise, say "serves two". Please! It's drowned in red-wine vinegar. This would not normally be a problem if it were soaked up by a toasted hoagie roll, but that much vinegar should only used for large mopping jobs. I could have made this myself with a packet of pepperonis not even separated into individual slices, but just cut in half and dumped in the bowl.  If you happen to go, head back to the bathroom and if you find yourself waiting for it to be free, you'll be staring straight into the 8x10 closet that is the kitchen. Very tight quarters is no excuse; look what Chris Bianco does in that little corner of his old firehouse garage bay!  I really don't want to write off Maizie's, but I'll need to hear that they've hired (read contracted out for) someone with the TALENT to put ingredients together in a very special way. Until then, I won't be back.

poor execution, no coordination in the kitchen, less than savory ingredients. ===  What is it about Phoenicians and any pizza not served by Dominos or Pizza Hut? They go gaga for it. They 5-star it. They vote it number one in the nation and it makes Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit).  I was excited about this place given all the extremely high reviews and yelp hype; they even have their Yelp window sticker. I arrived without a reservation and my guests and I were seated right away. Service was prompt and the food runner/buser, while very timid, was on the ball refilling our drinks.  The thin-crust pizza dough, cut into small pieces for the bread tray was served hot and crispy from the oven, but there was no inspiration, no flavor. The sweet olive salad that accompanied it was the same, sweetened by something, but nothing more. The kitchen needs someone to light the spark, get them to THINK before they just drop the plate for pickup.  The caprese salad was beautiful, but arrived with no pepper, no salt, and no olive oil. It was there on the table, but, really? I'm of the camp that the s/p shakers are there for decoration only; the kitchen is supposed to season my order correctly. If the kitchen isn't going to do it, at least offer freshly ground pepper at the table by the server. Is this a do-it-yourself menu?  I ordered the grilled calamari salad because I'm tired of breaded-and-fried. Unfortunately the only taste I got from the salad were the flavors from the grill left over from other meat that was "recently" prepared there. I hope recently means just that day, no earlier. No dressing, no tossed-with-anything before plating, zip. Salad mix was straight from the Dole pre-mix bag.  The main courses from the kitchen arrived all at once, but we were told the veggie pizza was still on its way. Seven minutes later it arrived, and being polite diners, the rest of us had waited. You guessed it, ours were cold. Lasagna was overcooked and mushy, uninteresting with the gobs of pizza sauce piled on it; I could have done better at the ready-wrap from Fresh and Easy. Cream sauce from the artichoke dish was so rich and thick, it could be called cheese; yuck. The artichokes themselves hadn't been peeled and the outer chewy leaf was still on! The veggie pizza's crust was the same bland bread we had just sampled, its veggies too thickly cut to cook properly, so they were partially raw with cool centers.  We were offered a tiramisu as dessert and it was sumptuous.  I hope that I get to update this review with a better result next time, but for now, what these cooks need is a good kick in the pants.  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!

Deserves its place at the bottom of your Yellow pages listing for Pizza. Wishing it were "ZZZ Pizza".  --slices on display better suited for a museum of ancient antiquity; --a FRESHLY made pizza (oh HELL, you didn't think I was gonna let you serve me that faded crap I coulda found in the corner of my little brother's dorm room, did you?!!!), two beers and a small salad for $50???!!! several four letter words come to mind, just for you. --finished dough little better than a microwaved Starbuck's panini. --greasy crust wishes it could rise to deserve a Peter Piper Pizza box.  --BLARING commercial TV (yes, that means commercials) invades your attempt at conversation while... --staff stand idly doing nothing. --unclean restrooms make you wonder how clean the kitchen is.  shame on all of you (no, not you, YOU. yeah you know who you are) who told me I _have_ to try Z Pizza: you really need to try this great restaurant nearby called "Diamonds".

FRESH calamari and the most awesome gravy ive had in a long time. Homemade cheesecake is light and creamy, not heavy and cakey. This place has something on the menu for everyone!  Open the door to this open-kitchen slash rustic-brasserie slash sports-bar slash italian eatery and you're instantly smacked with the delectable aromas of baked and stewed italian favorites.  Wins: --awesomely fresh calamari app with the best tomato sauce (gravy) anywhere. --homemade cheesecake for first-timers. Wowow. --pasta was out of the world with moist perfectly-cooked chicken  But.... Ugh: # caesar salad bland. Missing egg, lemon, cheese and anchovy. Don't call is a caesar. # butter served in peel-your-own foil-and-plastic pad onesies. # bacon-wrapped prawns swimming in generic sweet and sour gook. What a shame. # steak-wrapped asparagus in marsala mushroom sauce overcooked and slimy. Too bad. # filet mignon promised on menu as cut to order, but it was clearly not. Ive had better from the grocery manager-special clearance bin. Veg was pitiful. Sliced zucchini bland and old. Barely tepid. Plop of potato mash, bland, boring, almost cold.  Service hit or miss. Little coordination or communication, just lots of staff walking around doing something else besides serving. Regular patrons get the attention.

HURRY. GET OVER TO THIS PLACE! AN ARCHITECTURAL  CELEBRATION OF THE CIRCLE AND A WONDERFUL MINGLING OF AMERICAN CUISINE WITH MEDITERRANEAN STYLE. Great value in the Summer Prix Fix at $30 pp++.  THE INTRODUCTION --hidden from the street (you have to know you're going there), its entrance is a grand circular plaza swathed with inlaid stone and a fantastic layered fountain... --perfect turning radius for a 15-passenger limousine; --entryway fit for royalty is framed with columns and features two gigantic entry doors in case you arrived in a servant-borne carriage; --once inside the atrium, the swank really kicks in... --across another cavernous circular space, the host podium awaits you afront a fabulous white bead curtain; --off left is the bar with plush paisley-shaped seating (the yin-and-yang being the best way to split a circle); --lighting and furniture design is a wonderful fusion of 50's and contemporary.  BUT THE BEST PART: THE CUISINE --great martini preparation; all it needs is a glassware upgrade... --speaking of, server coyly replaced ours when he noticed it was spotty -- kudos, man! --fabulous Sacred Stone cab had someone Googling for the winery's contact info. --fried calamari over cantaloupe butter, garnished with cantaloupe caviar. --pan roasted free-range chicken breast is soft pillowy perfection --salmon was a bit firm for my taste, but the orzo was excellent --aged prime rib eye with fingerling potato pancetta hash just the right blend of flavors, a tasty reduction accompanies and ascended several levels of heaven with the Sacred Stone.  BUT... --dessert was a disappointment. creme brulee was uninspired and the "freshly baked cookies" were far from. No fruit anywhere.  Opened at the beginning of the Arizona summer (test-your-resolve-and-your-bank-account-balance season for restaurants). Maybe they wanted several months to prepare for season. The garage-doored wall will open to some fun outdoor seating once it cools down.  I really hope this one survives. Make your reservation today!

A life-changing event. One of the top 5 meals of my entire life. Absolute perfection in haute cuisine: food, ambiance, service all five-star. ===  I am honored to review the heavenly nirvana that is Sinatra at Encore. That a restaurant could be so well composed only two weeks after opening is otherworldly. Clearly the gods have shone on this mansion of Olympus.  Reservations are required. Dress is extremely up; don't embarrass yourself by even walking into this hotel without a jacket or donned in high European couture: the splendour of the decor absolutely demands your highest respect. Gloriously beautiful butterfly mosaics guide your way highlighted by the RED red chandeliers above (did I mention that they are red?). You may pass by some disappointed fanny-packed, windbreakered walk-ups, turned away without a reservation as you take your seat atop a stool, one of just seven at the bar. Old blue eyes is serenading you as you are about to embark on the swankiest dinner of a thousand lifetimes.  I ordered my Dubonnet Manhattan and was proud to be the first pour from the newly unsealed bottle. History. Should have been real cherries, but I'm too overwhelmed to fuss. Hostess arrives to escort us... Hmm, not what I'd expect for the look in a swanky Maitre'd but again, I'm not fussing. I get to sit under this gigantic portrait of the man himself.  Every detail is supreme. The royal orchids table arrangement and linen-topped oil lamp shade masking the flickering flame within. The embroidered artwork of butterflies on silk napkins. The lushly textured orange tablecloth (how can I have a shirt made from that material?!?) and the orange piping framing the absolutely white seat cushions.  The wine list is eclectic and mostly complete. A wonderfully huge Amarone awaits our dessert and just champagne cocktails for now.  Lobster raviolis are absolute perfection. Mixed with buttery tomatoes, so fine. The ossobucco melts in your mouth, the marrow the finest I have ever had. I was so deeply moved that I wished hard that I might be able to pay homage to the chef; I was lucky enough to be able to present my thanks personally, but that's a story for the memoirs.  They even made my favorite dessert to accompany the vanilla gelato. Strawberries, mint and balsamic vinegar. Was there a hint of pepper?   I can't wait to go back.

DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. See you in 2012.  take a hint from $6.95 lunch special price. you could do better at your grocer's freezer-door aisle. seriously.  --salad: faded with gloopy-glop peanut oil corn-syrupy vinaigrette. No, I can still tell that salad is a week old, no matter how much dressing you add!! --displayed sushi fish wrapped 10 times over in plastic in the middle of lunch rush. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?! --fried rice by-the-minute (as in Minute Rice) doused with soy sauce and served by the ice-cream scoop. BLECH. --shake-'n-bake shrimp tempura deep fried, but I can still tell it's not fresh. --edamame well seasoned and microwaved warm, but not fresh. --orange chicken a gloopy-glop of corn-syrupy orange-colored mucous   Service? No clue. --take my order 45 seconds after you drop the menu? COME BACK! --90 seconds later? OK, I guess I had better move!  FAIL. --Check on your guest after a few bites to see if everything is ok. FAIL. --If you clear and I have taken only one bite, you must ask. EPIC FAIL.   I did this place a few years ago, but avoided the review, thinking i could go back and try again. Today I wish I had stamped it with double-x back then. I could have saved myself (and perhaps some of you) the trouble and indigestion. How have they stayed open so long?!

BORING, FLAVORLESS, OVERPRICED CRAP; exposed-filament bulbs, paper napkins, sans s/p shakers. Kale- and collard-earthy and squishy garnishes little better than pig fodder.  --sealed brown concrete, minimalist 5x7 postage-stamp art in monochromatic, rhythmically-spaced repetition --exposed-filament bulbs throughout give that yellowish glow evocative of kidnap cinema; --gangsta buser keeps glaring at us, slamming our glasses down after refilling them; oh, maybe we won't get out of here alive! --going to charge me $17 for pasta? buy some GODDAM cloth napkins! --"table bread" is a plastic package of stale, pencil-thick breadsticks. what would you think if someone brought you two packs of saltines? Yeah, that's what I mean! --ambient music an unpleasant mix of rural-southern Creole woo-woo ritual chant, washboard-and-spoon percussion and harmonica (I think they recruited that woman from the GTA3 shanty town); --outside, the manager is explaining to the police amidst an army of tow trucks that these cars really are valet-professionally parked, not by their owners.  --heirloom tomato side dish was the one delicious thing. At $3, the best value on the menu (+1 star)... --unfortunately the spices were so old there was no flavor left in them. --no s/p shakers; on request we received two contact-lens cups of s/p for pinching, chef style (i.e. no spoons).  On our way out, some employee was being disciplined on the back steps, presumably about to quit. I've never been so glad to quit a place as this.

Moist, fresh food from a chain, on the west side. Who'd have thunk?  --actual STEAMED fresh vegetables, not micro frozen. see what little effort it takes? --loved the "buffalo" potatoes; nicely cooked, bite-size, drenched in wing sauce with ranch for dipping. BING. --really pricey for what it is. $14 for a basic salad? where do you think we are, Scottsdale? --too many windows, too much light to be a proper pub --decor from some pick-by-page-and-letter Irish kitsch catalog. --um. there's a metal fishnet thing on the ceiling! --all two- and four-tops except for a giant picnic-table size 16-top: you can't bring your extra 0.6 out of 2.6 children -- who needed him anyway? --ding for leaving my half-and-half on the bar for 5 minutes; this is a PUB, lady! Don't keep me from my Guiness and Harp!  Something surreal about the popup mall that sits across from a dead field. And right on the corner is the Auld Dubliner. Far too many windows for a proper pub. Fill those in, man! And what do we get to look at? The empty dead field across the street.  Although very moist and fresh, the food here is mostly bland. Thank God for Coleman's mustard. Between us all we emptied the entire jar onto our food; ok, most of it was on my plate, but hey!

off-strip glamour without the cattle call.  --beautiful modern styling and broad public spaces. clean lines with a retro feel --straightforward floorplans make getting places simple (unlike the labyrinthine casino hell of the strip) --well appointed spa has all the usuals you expect from a five-star spa steam and sauna, jacuzzi, showers, lounge and baths --lavish rooms with all the 5-star amenities; in-room iron; plush bedding and large, fragrant towels (wishing i could buy that detergent) --wooden hangars with real hooks, not theft-prevention hangar hell. --complimentary plush terrycloth robes on request (you must sign for them) --laundry/dry cleaning service, shoe shine --large floor-to-ceiling windows face north to the strip, or south to the hills --sit in your bathtub enjoy the view (or lower the privacy shade) --take your pick from great restaurants and casual eateries  --helpful, friendly and outgoing dealers and boxmen --service culture pervades, staff _always_ looking for ways to assist you, not refer you to the "right" department for you to make your request. --casino bar staff (Stacy) friendly and helpful. drink specials are fun.  #no doorman. bell staff loiter nearby but should always be present _at_ the entrance to open and close your car doors #no newspaper delivery to room (get up early to grab yours by the elevator before they run out) #one newspaper option (should be 3+) #bed's large headboard furniture blocks access to electrical outlets #more electrical outlets in room needed (we've got laptops, ipods, cell phones and more!) bring your power strip! #wine bar closed mondays and tuesdays #rooftop restaurant closed for renovations... argh. it's one of the reasons we came here!  to sit again on the rooftop patio, sipping champagne and taking in the view.

I can't wait to spend an hour in there, just exploring!

EDGY MEXICAN CON SAVOR. Chicharron of grilled cheese, "green" rice, Grilled Chicken, Sangria. Cock a doodle DOO! White Rooster is a jewel.   --revamped spot has finally found the right groove. Sealed concrete and faux Herman Miller with unique modern touches.  --"chicharron" of grilled cheese is a must have. No flaky pig skin here, and you'll want to order another on righ away.  --fresh ingredients throughout, down to the authentic flavorings of the real Mexican queso fresco atop the beans.  --asado of the chicken asado preserves delightful juicyness of the meat troughout each delectable crispy bite --"green" rice topped with wonderful limed greens --New York steak was not filet mignon, but hard to find fault with the flavor packed in those grilled veggies.  --cheeseburger fresh and greasy good covered with more of that delicious cheese mix --banana crepes were simple and elegant dolloped with creme fresh --fresh fruit is more of the garnish from the  sangria cocktails. How'd he know I wanted more of exactly that?!  --menu somewhat small, but that kitchen is tiny. Quality over quantity any day.  --exposed surfaces make for a noisy atmosphere, not the quiet candlelight spot --server Daniel is always on top of it --chef often visits the dining room making sure every chair and every fork is in place  I can't wait to go back.

that's NOT a cheese steak. drive a bit further to Rinaldi's for the real thing.  --"roll" is partially-cooked machine-made batch of chemicals --so greasy I had to wipe the table afterward, and I never even took it out of the wrapper; the grease soaked through the foil wrapper (how is that possible) --mushrooms surely from a can --onions from I'm-afraid-to-think-about-where-they-might-be-from  I'm certainly one to stick to family tradition (placing my finger against my nostril as I say it), but this one belongs in the gutter.  NO.

Day 2 and they're off to a good start!  --warm, firm-crust sourdough bread, my favorite; --gorgonzola-topped lamb chops didn't work for me. they just don't go together. --crusted lavosh tries too hard, too much rosemary; --crab cakes moist and nice texture, needs more crisp; --warm garnish (lettuce, spinach) salads perfectly cooked!! --lobster bisque has cheese! ew; --shrimp diavolo, needed chives not green onions, penne not right choice for pasta, wanted tomatoes, not just sauce; --no steaks for lunch, except steak salad. very north-scottsdale  --ratio of staff to guest is at least 4 to 1, and the place was pretty full (lots of manager types watching your every move); they've spent a lot of time prepping for service details and it shows ... and on the 2nd day! --exciting restaurant opening, you can feel the energy; --chandeliers and wall treatments and "curly fantasy" remind me too much of  Cheesecake Factory (just across the street) --chef stands at the pass in front of the kitchen, Hell's Kitchen-style. he even has the pencil perched on his ear, and he yells out the orders to the kitchen. all that's missing is the "YES! CHEF!!"  can't wait to go back next week for a steak dinner.

BOBA!! Those delightful squishy tapioca balls that you suck up a huge-wide straw along with your smoothie!  --Great dessert spot after your Pho Bang, or Da Vang. --convenient walk-in in this Vietnamese strip mall --staff extremely friendly and accommodating to make your smoothie exactly to your wishes --fresh fruit, coffee, tea, and Thai tea --Thrifty ice cream --Vietnamese desserts --Boba drinks sealed with Asian plastic seal (like Ramen-cup tops)  I love boba. I love it's squishy surprise that goes with your fruit smoothie. Today's boba were not as firm as some, but it could just be the batch. They have boba jelly too -- think softer gummi bears.

NO CARDS ACCEPTED. CASH ONLY. ATM INSIDE FOR $1.50 FEE.  --no seating, pickup only; call in your order ahead of time --wings are huge and meaty but nothing special; --out of 17 sauces, when I said "try to kill me" and he said "suicide" will be the one for you. I was excited but the heat barely piqued. --owner's brother ran the long wong's which used to be in this spot? Bait and switch or just a rename? --steak and provolone hoagie was probably better eaten while standing there; doesn't travel well --pepperoni hand tossed serves two and loaded with cheese.   Meh.

sriracha and Tabasco are your only hopes at hippies  --Bland, greasy and undercooked potato dice --coffee quality (like everything else here) is piss-poor --pancakes from a box, agave syrup doesn't do much --plastic plates and utensils ruin whatever's left, like a fly-infested bowl of potato mush at the neighborhood pot luck, now scooped to mouth with a flimsy twist of soft sporkage.  --regular commercial radio accompanies...with commercials  MISS IT

HIT AND MISS. MOSTLY MISS. GO FOR THE TUNA STARTER AND ORDER A DOUBLE PORTION; REAL HIT!  THE FOOD -- tuna sashimi dish is great value, great flavors. order it. -- coconut rum with watermelon liqueur a winner, if only the bartender would remember to add the fruit. do you need a recipe book? -- hash with eggs arrives eggs-over-hard despite my instructions for easy -- toasted english muffin slathered with butter, but not toasted. -- chicken salad's chicken was bland except for the rub on the edge. boo. -- taco plate features raw, unprepared corn tortillas. yeah, i can pull one from the bag and dump something in it too! why would i pay for that? -- salsa too salty -- cole slaw just not interesting, ends up a plate filler. blech.  THE DECOR -- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls. -- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.  THE REST -- starting to develop a pet peeve for "sauces" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish. IT GOES UNDERNEATH THE ITEM OR NEXT TO IT! OR IMAGINE.... IN IT. -- no reservation taken unless you've got six in your party. BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside.

great value in yelp offer. just remember this is a business, in business. good fish costs bucks. respect it, folks. don't abuse it! DESPITE THE LOCATION, THIS SUSHI SPOT IS LEGIT!  --great tako sunomono. tender and bittersweet. nice. --miso soup spot on. --salmon skin hand roll. ftw.  #veg tempura was crispy but not flakey.  squished in a corner of this impossible strip mall along the Bell Rd abyss of consumerism shopping hell, this jewel of a japanese eatery blesses the area with your favorites, prepared in proper japanese style.  can't wait for my next meal there!

I'VE NEVER SPAT OUT SO MUCH FOOD IN MY LIFE! I WISH THE MEMORY OF THIS PLACE WERE AS SHORT AS THE TIME THE FOOD SPENT IN MY STOMACH. I barely got home before I was wretching it all out. All hail to the porcelain god!  Sometimes those Curious George moments of exploratory inquest (like Diamonds on 7th Ave) should just be suppressed. In the case of Great China Super Buffet, curiosity _will_ kill the cat.  In case you're dragged there by your kidnappers: --green beans with you-can't-believe-it's-not-butter slipperyness is swallowable --fresh fruit with sugary sweet red-colored corn syrup slathered all over it. it is fruit, after all. --cantaloupe, honeydew and red grapes are the ONLY safe items in the whole place --cook-to-order BBQ bar is a novelty, but the meat quality is little better than Bantha Poo-doo.  104 items, tasted and spat. The notable worst of the worst: --cooked seafood. Krab pieces and wonton noodles buried under a pile of melted cheese. think gag reflex. --butter mushrooms. squishy rubber which if not held carefully in the mouth while chewing, might bounce into your throat and choke you. --halved hard-boiled eggs. how can a hard boiled egg be so dry it's crunchy? --gloopy globs of "honey", "sweet", "bbq" and 30 other substitute names for breaded, fried and corn-syruped to death. it'll be _your_ death. --bbq pork ribs are little more than charred fat left on the bone, painted red and then baked. EW --oh, i almost forgot the horrible mystery sushi rolls. don't let the brightly colored drizzle sauce fool you! --shell-on shrimps mean naive customers are about to eat shrimp poop. DE-VEIN THEM, OR DON'T SERVE THEM, YOU PIGS!  SLASH MEXICAN --China is close enough of a translation in Spanish. Still, they serve Mexican food here, too. --"Fried Rice" is little more than pasty-orange "Spanish"-style, but it's NASTY --Enchiladas. At a Chinese place? Come on! --Burritos. WHAT?!!! --oh, and Pizza, and Garlic Bread !!!  PIGSTY --flies swarmed in the walkways between islands and kitchen. --dishes and leftover food stacked endlessly behind half-wall stations in buser tub after buser tub --carpet is so filthy you might slip and slide --glass doors, entry walkway tile, and hostess counters haven't been cleaned in months --pussy ooze dripped off the mouth of the gumball machine in the entryway  @Rand H. -- Are you an investor or something? I hope you have insurance. You CAN'T be serious about a fiver review. Boo!  @The-rest-of-you. Make me wish I could "enemy" yelpers. Why didn't you give me a proper goddam warning?!?!  I **AM** GOING TO CALL THE EFFING HEALTH INSPECTOR !!!

Owner and cook really trying here, but presentation is completely off, roast beef "special" was dry, sauces are parochial, and manager did the post-meal plate-scrape on our table, right in front of us.  Did I mention that the presentation is completely off? Just look at the pics. Ugh. Haven't seen it this bad since 7th Avenue "soul food" fried-till-they-bounce de-presented plate presentations.  BYOB with no corkage fee. nice.  # Stuffed chicken breasts were the usual sterroid- and hormone-induced gargantuonomous meat hunks which are sadly the norm these days. Boring. # "Root vegetables" were these sad little dried plantain-things  Little better than amateur home-made.  With the closure of the best french bakery in metro phoenix, Is there *any* proper restaurant in this part of town?  Sorry, Flapjacks. Stick to breakfast?

Feast for the eyes, this old bank building is a cornucopia of mixed materials from glass to wood to concrete to steel to block to brick and astroturf. Dining a mixed bag, but you're sure to SEE something you like. [blink]  --best seat in thehouse is the corner by the fire --bacchi (sp?) Ball court just like home vig location --hip urban feel which is difficult to find downtown.  --great service, attentive and super friendly. --she even caught the bartender (it was hard to miss) shaking the shit out of my martini, stopped him and made him start over.  --rib eye fatty, not trimmed, and in pieces. Horrible cut. --spinach puree very interesting, but doesn't work as presented. (Wants to surround the dish, not be shuffled off on the side) --so too go the potatoes. Gratin slightly burned and wants to be as elegant as the architectural lines of the building. Redesign this plate! --burger, although ordered medium, arrived charred but RAW!! --onion rings nothing to write home about. --banana bread pudding rich enough to serve 4. split it, or --hot fudge sundae. NICE!  not many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out.

feast for the eyes AND for your gourmet tastes. PROPER kitchen makes everything from scratch and it shows.  --freshly-made bloody mary mix, and freshly-opened olives jar (yes, you can tell). i'll have 3. at $5 for sunday brunch you can't go wrong. --shepherd's pie is the BOMB-awesome. they even fuss up the plate so it doesn't look too pretty, but don't believe your eyes: what's under those eggs will rock your mouth with pleasure! --potato coins are fun! --cheese plate was not on the menu, but chef happily obliged to accompany my v.c. yellow-label (no longer on the menu). they even made toast points for me. wowza. --these wings are the best i've had. perfectly cooked and the best sauce ever.  --super friendly staff knows their stuff, ingredients, and serves it with big smiles. --great family place (kids can play bacchi or bean bags in the patio), and  --goes upscale in a flash too; awesome acid jazz feel --new converted entrance gives the smokers a nice spot and yet keeps them on their own. --free wifi for your business meeting and big booths to boot  #argh. dropped the yellow label from the wine list. mumm is motor oil. how abaout tattainger? #forced valet parking is a bust. i know they have to do it, but i just want to park my own car. (if you see the valet, just park across the street if you're as fussy as me) #wish they opened 30 minutes earlier on sundays; 10:00 leaves me standing outside every time.  vig uptown gets my award for most-improved food quality. whether it's the temperature, the freshness, the plating, the preparations, the simple but perfect blend of seasoning and flavor, vig uptown should be proud.  not many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out.

french elegance of cuisine and the finest of service, straight from paris. i am honored to give georges my fourth and fifth star and look forward with great anticipation to my next visit to charlotte.  all that's missing is the you-will-get-to-know-your-neighbors closeness of tables to each other. i don't think it would go over well with american diners, but literally *everything* else was exactly and perfectly from an excellent parisian brasserie. thank you. thank you.  i needed this dinner tonight. it's been over a year since i have had the pleasure of traveling to my favorite city in the world, paris, france. owner george and chef  gave me a dinner experience i shall not soon forget. --proudly facing the courtyard of this south park plaza, george's friendly and helpful valet took my car into their care. --maitre'd graciously took my coat and our reservation confirmed, we glided to our table, excellently set and perfectly lit.   an epic menu lists all my favorites. thankfully i have 3 of my best friends and colleagues with me for whom I can order and insist on tasting theirs... muahaha.  --sous vide short rib with sweet and sour cabbage and black garlic sauce.  epic rich taste whose sauce can only be mopped to the last squidge with the delectable and perfectly crispy crust of table bread. --dozen oysters sampled from east and west coasts. best enjoyed with your perfect sapphire martini, horseradish and vinegared onions. oh yes, and don't forget the drop of tobasco and saltine cracker chaser.  mmmmm... --saute of fois gras with cinnamon and maple breadstick. broiled leek and topped with fried quail egg. presented by chef himself, it was a masterpiece of flavor and what interesting choices. no, this wasn't on the menu, but chef graciously and proudly accepted my request and served a dish i shall not soon forget. magnifique, chef!!! --ceasar salad was perfection in mix of lemon, egg and cheese, topped with a beautiful and oh-so-fresh anchovy. all i needed was to lightly brush that delectable and fresh slice of romaine over the fish to get the perfect flavor. the anchovy was the perfect set of last bites.  and now to the main course... what perfection in execution. --cassoulet.  a very unique take on this classic wintery french seasonal. served as it should be in a cast iron dish, it is *so* hot, you can use the dish as your personal heater. the bean stew served with duck, sausage and beef is rich and flavorful. chef tops this version with delectable crispy cheesy flakey bits. could they be brreadcrumbs? i forgot to ask. what a wonderful and especially unique interpretation of this southern favorite. --filet mignon with bernaise and haricots verts. oh my did i make the right choice for the green beans. perfectly cooked and rich yet light and letting the simplicity of the vegetable and its quality since through. the filet is delightfully peppery and dipped in the bright and sour bernaise, it was even more perfect with the wine (see below) --coq au vin with spinach and aligot potatoes. plat du jour. *how* could i pass it up. i couldn't. it was delightfully moist and rich. what a special feast! --angus ground beef burger on brioche bun with gruyere and carmelized onions. with frites. you burger lovers out there can have your prime meat ground and served casual style in this fabulous presentation.  topping the meal were the two very special bottles from the manager's private stash. the '96 chateau lynch bages was a special treat. in my own private stash are several of the best of the '96 bordeaux masterpieces for my 50th and 60th birthdays. the lynch bages did not disappoint. the '07 heitz cab was listed, but somehow we got the '06 instead. lucky! lucky! lucky!  dessert featured our server's choice of fresh berries, balsamic, black pepper and mint, as is my tradition.  :)

"japanese" steakhouse for the masses, serving mayo-slathered "white tuna" improvised-roll CRAP. perfect match for the Bell Road restaurant abyss of HELL. HEAD TO FRESH WASABI SUSHI BAR DOWN THE STREET.  yeah, yeah... benihana chop chop, zing zing. that's all great, but i look for the seeds of real japanese cuisine, and they're almost nowhere to be found here... (and I gave it 3 hopeful visits before writing this.)  --love the tempura. crab stick tempura is my comfort food, and the tempura is expertly executed. kudos to the kitchen. +star  #beverage menu boasts a broad sake selection, but none of them are ever in stock. #when asked, the sushi chef promises "all the fish is the best". when your chef says that, it means that NONE of his stuff is fresh. #chef refuses to speak with you when you sit at the bar, inches from him. you must order through the server, and she will speak with the chef. BUT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT! #and the server does not know the japanese words for anything on the menu! #after my ticket comes up on his printer, he looks at it briefly, and then continues his side work. #wait for it.  #entry experience paying attention to all the wrong things. fused-to-the-sidewalk bird poop all the way to the broken entry door with taped paper sign, "use other door", complete with arrow. exposed water spicket rusting and leaking all over the walkway. Uh oh. reminds me of "Diamonds Chinese" (see review) glass is filthy as is the rotting wood door handle. ew. "i wonder what's inside" as i pull the crookedly-hanging door from its frame... real japanese experience takes pride in the cleanliness of your entryway and the approach of your guest. not here.

Fresh vegetables, quality a bit low for the prices, too much Mexican influence. Bright and clean.  --bright, clean and quiet. it's what i look for in a Chinese restie. --well staffed to handle all 30 tables promptly and courteously  --rotisserie in corner showcases the roast duck and other delicacies  --spicy squid, a specialty, has no oomph, just greasy glooph. even the sliced jalapenos are mute  --spicy noodles with shrimp have nice cumin yellow to its curry, but mostly uncooked onions and bell pepper strips, a la fajitas just ruin it. --shrimp not overcooked, but frozen a few times along the way  --mongolian beef is beaten and squishy, again poor quality. --again, the barely cooked onions and bell pepper strips ruin --only saving grace is the heat from the shockingly dry red chiles which suck up all your saliva before exploding in your mouth like a radiation bomb  I clearly made poor choices from the American-friendly menu. I'll need a native to show me the ropes of the authentic next time around.

one of the most beautiful views in phoenix, but food is just so-so, catering to rich blue hairs "escaping" from their posh fountain hills bungalows. nothing new in this new american. just standard, safe recipes for standard, safe customers. meh.  #wynd is spelled W.I.N.D. #hostess' reservation book is on the opposite counter. stoopy ass in your face for "do you have a reservation" and "what is your last name" #hostess sets the negative tone with "i see you requested a window table, but we've already given them all out." --not necessary because one wall of the restaurant has been rolled away to reveal the beatiful view. EVERY table is a window table.  --safe wine list with all your corporate favorites, but featuring some Arizona wines ?! go on the "adventurous" side with a Franciscan Cab. (rolling eyes)  #smoked salmon and spinach *casserole* is what it should have said. not fresh, gecky and crumby on top. yuck. #caesar salad. meh. no pepper grinder in sight. none offered. (suspect it's too spicy for blue hairs, so they stopped it long ago) #lamb shank with mashed and gravy could serve 3. doggie bag it for fido's feast  #no fresh mint on property. just what you see on the menu, please. (a.k.a. NO SUBSTITUTIONS) #no espresso machine on property, just drip. (blue hairs drink decaf don't you know!) #creme brulee with butterflied strawberry. meh. so 15 years ago.  IF ONLY... One could transplant Kai's kitchen and staff to this view and location, you'd have a dining destination worthy of a plane ticket from *anywhere*. Don't get me wrong, Kai is still worth the plane ticket from anywhere.

alas, since my first meal here in Oct 2010, kitchen staff has changed and gone are the details which made this a formidable lunch bistro in the french style. BOO.  #CROQUE MADAME see my pic of the most spectacular Croque Madame I've had in my life. it was here, back in Oct 2010.  unfortunately, the Dec 2012 version is too eggy, not enough ham, boring bechamel and missing the frisee and vinaigrette which balanced this dish and made it so delightful to photograph and look at.  #BEEF TARTARE I won't even bother with ground beef tartare anymore. it's a preference. a strong one.  #AYCD BLOODY MARY Great price for all-you-can-drink bloody mary, but it's so goddam spicy that i can barely get the first one down. And this is from the guy who sprinkles ghost chili flakes on my fried chicken.  #DECOR like the harsh presentation of food, the restaurant lacks the balance of soft touches and color. mounted cold white plates and orangey-brown liquid in metronomically placed-in-a-row comme-ca-monogrammed wine bottles just don't cut it.  !VIEW The windows give you full view of Las Vegas Blvd traffic just below you, and to the north the faux Eiffel. [shaking head... you just can't get away from it, either here or in Paris itself  :P  ]  not for lack of wanting to revisit comme ca; it's just that i'm rarely in vegas on a friday, sat or sun for lunch. true to french lunch hours, you cannot get in before noon.

Ghost chili hand roll challenge. If done in 30min, pic on "wall of flame"!! Serious!  but after all im here for the fish and it barely passes. #yellowtail fishy, not fresh #tamago ordered in (not fresh) arrives frozen, microwaved defrost. Epic fail. --great salmon, but that's easy. #miso has no tofu, too salty, somehow creamy, flakes of seaweed, not pieces like im expecting #Ama ebi frozen also must be microwaved to order.I'm just sayin'.  --very friendly, attentive service as mentioned by others, but --sushi chef is explaining that they just don't do the serious stuff 'cause no one orders it. WHAT?!!  Dood. If you can't do it right, then don't serve it.   Now, about the GHOST CHILI CHALLENGE  Okay, so I can finally say I've had my taste of Ghost Chili. It is an experience like no other. The instant it touches your tongue, it's like someone set it on fire. And it just escalates from there. Up, up, up, up. Hotter. Hotter. The pain is excruciating. Naturally you swallow, but that was a mistake. You should have spit it out. Even with soy milk, the next 30 minutes are sheer agony. No amount of squirming, wringing of hands, gritting of teeth or yelling will help you.  And that was from one bite. There are but 5 pics on the wall, and according to chef, all of them had downed the roll in two or three bites. Mistake. An ambulance ride, and a night of morphene-induced sleep is your only escape. You must sign a waiver before you begin which includes a line warning of possible eminent death. WOW that was hot.  Having said it, I'm glad I tried it. Those who say you can take any level of spicyness, this Yume is your final resting place and without the 30-hour plane flight to India where they're grown.

Besides great fish here, (YES THIS PLACE IS LEGIT)... Home of the ghost chili roll, not for the beginner. The ghost chili will either kill you, put you in the hospital, or give you a 30-minute trip to hell and back. You must sign a waiver before they will serve you this roll. If you can eat it in 30 minutes, you get your picture on the wall. There's a reason there are STILL only 5 picture on that wall.  Fresh product, well done.   At last! Some proper sushi up in this neighborhood.  + masago, ikura fresh. Nigiri seaweed wrapper is crispy, dry and just the right flavor. Win. + spicy tuna roll made fresh, great flavor, just right consistency, subtle textures. Win.  + salmon skin roll. I do love a DING (instead of a beep) + unagi. Perfect. Again gotta love a ding!!  # tamago is on the menu, but not made in house. "It's not popular up here." # watch out for the front door. it is heavy and if you don't swing it wide enough, the giant steel pointed handle goes right into your rib!  note to self: don't be so eager! you'll get inside in a minute!

water shipped from back east makes this a crust worth the wait. order a big salad to share and have a "tasty beverage" ...or two! while you wait for it.  I don't care that this one's a chain. It's probably due to my very low standards for pizza in general. now, for sure, i'm not going to wait 5 hours at bianco's, and the 19 hour trip to naples isn't happening this week either, but goddam this is good pizza.  start with a nice big mediterranean or caesar salad to share, cover it with loosely and fresh ground pepper to get your cough going, and pick up a blue moon or peroni while you wait for the goods...  whether you like red with pepperoni (my favorite), or the white with garlic, pesto and veggies, it's just about the best you can get, and it's just consistent, through and through. meet that with ol' blue eyes serenading you under those cool and characteristic overhead lighting and paneling, you can't go wrong.  --love the lightness of the pizza overall. sample lots of different ones from your group! --awesome for your office staff lunch. just call ahead to reserve their back room. MMmmm! pizza to share all around, with pitchers of tasty beverages following. PASS THE PEPPERS AND PARMESAN! nice! --host/hostess even opens the door as you arrive! service! --consistent and very professional service standard. friendly, excited and helpful staff all around. never had a problem, and i'm one snarky bastard!  # pass on the sangria. even at half-off during happy hour, it's too juicy for my Manhattan-loving (read:burned-off-taste-buds) palatte.  # they do have a tendency to cram your party into a table smaller than is comfortable. just express your discomfort and get a new table. done! # as mentioned in other reviews, this location has burned some pizzas for me, but it is rare. SEND IT BACK...they're happy to make it again if not to your liking.

double-x blacklist. overrun with insects. fruit flies floating in drinks, buzzing flies in my face and landing on my food. reputation squandered. one star.  and i don't mean the straggler here-or-there fly which is unfortunate, but normal. i'm talking about GODDAM-pile-of-rotting-food-nearby attracting and breeding ground for all of them. little green ones with long wings, little black ones, and flies, flies, flies. SHAME on you. They're all over us and i'm no snoopy's pigpen!  same lies told by the same manager as last year. when I brought the insect problem to his attention he says, "i just had it done last week." last year when i told him about the sorry state of the piano's tuning, he says, "i just had it done last week.' GODDAMIT. BULLSHIT. *I* am a pianist, and I can tell when a piano hasn't been tuned in 6 months or more. LIAR!  ## host fiddled with his screen for *2 minutes* before he could take us back to our table. Really? ## server not listening. he had to make my drink 3 times over. OK the 3rd time, there were bugs floating in the glass.  ## heirloom tomatoes not ripe, cut too thick. seriously. i don't want to eat a raw potato either! ## sole stinks, not fresh.  i can't believe that in just one year, this place went from my highest recommendation for steaks and swank to double-x blacklist. what a shame!

$$$$-FOR-FAKERS!! Except there ain't no $30,000 boob-slash-nose jobs or BMW-drivin', MK-totin', Prada-wearin' scottsdale-plastic here! it's just a bizarre parallel-universe, bermuda-triangle zone of dress code, fried food and a ridiculous $250 table reservation fee in the middle of the ghetto!  In summary: SEVERE cultural differences and whacked understandings of service standards. I'm not sure how it happened, but i am out of place here. And i used to live a thousand feet from this goddam club!  . i'm the first to shake my head when i see a lengthy and heated exchange between a yelper and an owner. so when I saw the volleys between 3-year-Elite Asina G. and owner Rick, I wanted to look closer. Hell, this is my hood! Don't forget, people: Amy's Baking Company was making Yelp Eliters' blacklists for *years* before Chef Ramsey's visit a few months ago!  let. me. be. clear. This neighborhood is GHETTO! And i mean that in a Margaret Cho way! And I can say that because I lived a thousand feet from this club for -- count 'em -- 11 years! With the arrival of the light rail across camelback I *watched* the homeowners flee and businesses decline. But it was never that great before light rail anyway! On one corner you had a strip club, on another a mattress store, and behind it a hotel that rents rooms by the hour! i watched 3 iterations of ownership try to make this drycleaner's storage room into a restaurant. God bless them!  . To wit: The driveway features a tent sign that says "FIX YOUR CLOTH HERE" with grease pencil "ES" at the end of CLOTH! Another sign is taped to the driveway's brick pillar and says "FIX SUIT HERE FAST!" Another one is taped to the window: "FAST TAILOR HERE DAYS". Don't believe me? I took pictures! Check them out!  WHAT DO YOU MEAN A PAIR OF *CLEAN* PLAID VANS IS NOT ALLOWED? The dress code sign is leaned up against a card table leg and the letters spelling "No Tennis Shoes" are the cheapest-ass bingo-hall snack-bar menu letters I've ever seen in my goddam life!!!  I wonder. Is this a resurrection of the jockey club of former fame just a quarter mile east? That club closed 25 years ago after multiple gang shootings and deaths. My G*D, I hope and pray not!  . The story. i intended to celebrate with business partners, colleagues and friends for a CD release party. after walking past the signage mentioned above, we approached the cashier sitting beneath an awning outside the door. A black man sitting nearby got up from his stool, stepped out from underneath the awning, an then looking at me, bent back over his waist, tilted his head sideways and began moving his head up and down LOOKING me over. He was mumbling to himself in slang and posturing as if he was looking for an escalation. Oh dear. This is the doorman. Still contorted, he threw his arm at me, pointing and saying, "This one's OK, but THAT one can't come in!" Now pointing at my guest's shoes, the man said, "No tennis shoes!"  Dress code violation. WHAT? Where the F*&# do you people think you are?! this is 7th avenue and camelback, goddamit!   I asked for Ricky. The man said, "He *might* be here" but refused to find him or take further action. When I insisted, he began repeating "concerning?" He was now sitting back in his chair, slumped over, crossing his arms at me and giving me an indignant, disgusted look.  After he berated me and humiliated me, repeating "concerning?" over and over, I explained that I intended to inform a manager about how he was treating me. He shooed at me with the back of his hand and slumped further in his chair, guffawing.  Incredulous, I called the club and someone told me that Ricky was not working. I insisted that a manager come out and speak with me and one did. The manager supported the behavior of his employee and told me he was doing his job. When I began to point at the surrounding buildings and businesses and attempted to remind him where we were, he interrupted me, saying he was insulted and refused to speak with me further. He refused to give me his name and then stood with the doorman talking about us, laughing and pointing.  Horrified, I called our friends inside to explain that we would not be joining them, and watched as four separate black couples approached and were greeted cordially and gracefully by the manager and the doorman. No contorted posturing, mumbling or pointing treatment for them. And they were dressed as casually as we.   . Ricky B. -- Make no mistake. My and my fellow yelp-eliter Asina G.'s impressions are our own, and you are free to treat your customers as you will. Yelp even allows you to make a public response to our impressions and it will be placed below. But with this review I place EVERY OUNCE of my five-year gold elite reputation behind the following: I will not stand for the kind of discriminatory treatment we experienced from your staff. I shall actively spread the details of our experience among my friends and colleagues.  Welcome to the DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST.

cheesy krab goodness, slathered-in-sauce roll heaven/hell (depending upon your preference) sorry. not my bag, baby...  stopped in here hoping for a quick bite before night of the living neon. arriving just after happy hour started at 3, the list of rolls goes on! but i'm a traditionalist.  "It's ALL fresh," he says. Bologna! (or should I say spam?) Spam is served as a principal ingredient in most of their soups. #tuna nigiri, past its expire date. fishy, nasty. rice is warm. ew. #salmon nigiri, same. faded.  switching to cooked menu. maybe something better comes out of the kitchen? Nope...  UDON SOUP #broth from instant powder, laden with MSG. epic fail  #15% discount with yelp check in doesn't work if you aren't already GPSd to the area. no GPS coverage in here!  what a waste.

Carries well traditions of heavily french-sauced 80s, with many favorite perennials, prepared with surprising alterations. Desserts are a star attraction.  --Best macaroons in the world. I'd put them against the pastry chefs abroad. Light, perfectly formed, packed with flavor. The perfect bite to finish your delection. --steaks personally salted by chef before serving. perfectly cooked. --seared fois gras for the ages --creamed spinach --scallops with polenta and proper reduction. wow.  Not much to add here which hasn't already been said.  arriving at the Royal, i was nervous. Encore is visible just over the wall and the parking lot is empty. but step inside and you'll find some slightly odd design choices like the painted Yamaha grand in the lobby. feeling inspired i sat to play, but it was so out of tune, didn't make it for more than a few seconds.  i love that the restaurant's entry door is as big and heavy as a bank vault door. cool. so too go the chic treatments and lighting in the bar and dining room. very classy in a retro yet modern way. the clash of these styles is mesmerizing. and all this without the throngs and sea of mouth breathers. so quiet and exclusive.

FIVE STARS FOR FAKERS. Red carpet entrance and horribly silly and stupid revolving door set the tone for this ridiculous adventure.  #layout just makes no sense. it's like someone had a vision for a bar and then squished in all this other stuff wherever it could fit, including the tables. #the singer is real, but his music accompaniments are all cheap karakoke tracks, akin to their casio bossanova-button-rythm and one-finger-bass section ancestors. think price-is-right canned tracks but where are the beauties? #come on, they've got a baby grand up there. where's the live music like they have at EDDIE V'S across the way? #shuffled up to the rooftop pool patio (enclosed) for table at pool's edge. #ordering computer/POS/credit card terminal is on low shelf behind us. great spot to learn your servers' underwear brand preferences! #check out the pics. steak served alone, plopped on a searing hot plate. except there's nothing to sear. i try to explain that the steak is still cooking on that hot plate, but server just ignores.  HEAD TO EDDIE V'S FOR THE BEST STEAKHOUSE EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA.

Great work from the kitchen, but EPIC FAIL by front of house... If only that great food hadn't died on the pass! (6-8 minutes waiting!!) Beer arrived "cool" and FLAT. (how long had IT been sitting there?!) Goddamit!  [It looks like yelpers Zachary V. and Dan P. got it right before me. Poor service since at least a few months ago!]  The FRENCH ONION BURGER was well-conceived and the ingredients were great! --perfectly-cooked medium-rare burger --gruyere on top. great choice, perfect flavor, but already hardening and cold --grilled onions were juicy and not too salty --even the bun was buttery and delicious --tater-tots perfectly cooked ### Too bad it all arrived lukewarm and DEAD.  You know (or perhaps you don't) what "dead" food tastes like. If you don't know what that means, think "taking home a to-go bucket of fried chicken with a side bucket of french fries". When you arrive home, it's just faded! The fried chicken may still be kind of crispy and slightly warm and the fries may be tasty, but they've lost their life. They're DEAD! You go (or you should be going) to a restaurant to taste well-prepared food, from fresh, high-quality ingredients, presented just moments after cooking.  Here's the timeline: # arrived, patio table filthy from previous diners. Where's the support staff? (nowhere) # host didn't even notice how dirty our table was and take action to clean it # nor did our server when she arrived to ask us if we wanted waters. I had to ask her for a towel to clean it up. Oh, was this supposed to be a sawdust-bar? # +12 first service (to take drink orders) 12 minutes. # +19 minutes orders taken ## +22 minutes beer arrives. For a place called "cold beer" and cheeseburgers, I want to be *drinking* a draught beer no more than 6 minutes after I sit down. ### the beer is FLAT and "cool". At +22 minutes, I was going to drink it anyway. goddamit! I am so mad at you right now! +35 minutes, the table next to us, having arrived after us, receives part of their order (2 plates) before us +43 minutes, the table next to us receives their other 2 mains. ## +45 minutes, our food arrives, DEAD +50 minutes, i sent it back saying I don't have time now to wait another 20 minutes for more food. +55 minutes my colleagues sitting at a nearby table get their food, having arrived a few minutes after we did # +75 minutes, i have to flag down another server to get our check  Other suggestions: * Redesign your menus. Beer and Alcohol menu reads like an index card i'm using as a cheat-sheet for a lecture. * As you present the regular menu, explain it to me. Tell me that the apps and features are on the front, and the Burgers (!) are on the back. Talk to me about it, and get me excited for what i'm about to eat. Don't just drop me and run. * it's *&@#$'n October in Phoenix. The weather is fantastic. You gotta know that folks are going to want to find a place to sit and have a great lunch (beer and a burger) on a great patio. How can you not properly staff for a mildly busy lunch service?! * where are the busers, runners and support staff? (read: nowhere!) Offload some of this work from the servers to let them do their jobs properly.   Note: there may be a problem with my phone, but when I went to check in here and my GPS put me ON TOP OF the restaurant, it fell to 24th on the list of "nearby restaurants". :/

best brisket since my great uncle smoked it on the ranch in Southeastern AZ. i'd stake my family's K_W (that's K-bar-W to you non-ranch folk) steak on it!  And they've got a REAL smoker in the back! They may use liquid smoke in Texas, but this is the real thing, folks! Don't believe me? Check the pic; I've got the smoky shirt from those few seconds' standing in front of its open doors to prove it!  --pulled pork sandwich. ask for the mustard sauce. divine. --sirloin burger topped with andouille sausage and cheese. ask for no bun. --green pork chili. that's hatch green chiles inside! corn and hominy as well. --hand cut fries. these ain't no fast-food potatoes!  but the best dish of all is the combo... --brisket and half-rack. did i mention the mustard sauce? ask for it. meat falls off the bone, rich smoky flavor and i get to choose two sides... --coleslaw --potato salad --(did I mention the mustard sauce?) it's new this week, a family recipe from the Carolinas where they start their sauces from mustard, not from tomatoes. Don't miss it.  #sorry to say it, but the sandwich buns need an upgrade. i know there's probably a history here for their choice, but they just don't do justice to the wonders inside.  #yeah, the bathrooms are still remnants of this place's old days as a taco shop (10 years vacant!), but ladies, it's a BBQ JOINT! live a little!  #and yeah, the decor is a bit cold, but i'm here for excellent food and great service, not the pics on the wall. And they were excellent and great!  As of the writing of this review, they don't have their liquor license yet, but the counter is already placed for it. I can't wait to enjoy a bucket of beer with a rack of those ribs. Ooh, I just can't wait!!   This is the second of my neighborhood "audit" reviews since discovering some bullying bobblehead minions from the curve. Aren't they supposed to be automatically placed behind a filter? Admin! Admin! Over here!

only as fresh as however many people are dining. don't go unless the parking lot is FULL. you want that food to be MOVING! if buffet is your thing, this is a great value. such an assortment of dishes!  TIP: loiter at the line and wait until they bring out fresh food then swoop like a vulture. otherwise, you'll have difficulty swallowing.  * korean style rib. good flavor * hot and sour soup. * choose your own stir fry. Just make sure the ingredients are fresh  # rancid oysters, clams. argh. what was i thinking # old sushi. ugh. i'd forgotten what sushi tastes like when it's not made seconds before you eat it # most nigiri and sashimi is rancid. # skewered meat. don't know what kind of meat that was, but it was off.   i cut my teeth on buffet. when I was 3 and 4 years old my dad took me to buffet every day for lunch. whoa the memories!  more memories... they still have the ceiling fans connected by belts and pulleys from the bobby mcgee's days.

Chef Charleen is my hero. A rising star in our little town. Finally, I await to hear those three glorious words with gleeful anticipation: "Tonight she's doing..."  Tuesday nights are winemaker dinner. This season at $45pp++ it's a screaming deal. Who needs the pretense of a 6-person-, $1800-minimum chef's table (plus the plane ticket) when you can enjoy these (seemingly) simple but delectable creations, served to share:  --crispy ziti, peccorino, oil, garlic; --ceviche of mussels, salad. zips; --flat iron pork, vietnamese style over pork belly-wrapped pate and a crispy toast; --date marmalade, fig chutney, roasted goat cheese and chocolate with almonds and walnuts  all of this served with delightful accompanying wines from Wilcox, Arizona. Who knew!?  It's my new Tuesday night hangout. If you can get a table (reserve early), arrive just after 6 to mingle with your fellow gourmands or browse the bookending wine shop and corresponding mini-grocery. The fun begins at 6:30.

Bland. Overpriced. Great vibe and cool spot for drinks, and I mean cold, so bring a jacket.  #carne asada burro was a bean burro with a few a slivers of meat. At $15 I expected more. ##red rice bland and boring.  #black beans same. #fish tacos mush. Were they fried? Breaded? Who knows! #house margarita boring, too much ice. Not sure why (probably because it was just so boring), but I was distracted by the ice-machine ice. Very firm, doesnt melt, decreases the drink volume, done in 4 gulps. Taffer would be proud.  Rubio's easily puts Sol to shame.  Ho hum.

no frills ricey indian. meh. great spot for that sweet mango yogurt drink. wishing they were still in tempe; magic lost since the move up here.  #stingy on the meat. if they run out, they'll give you extra rice. WHAT?! #i'm not an expert on indian, but that rice is soggy for my taste. my indian friends say it must cook for hours to absorb the flavor, but they also say it should not be mushy like that.  --but that mango yogurt drink is a mean, sweet, beautiful thing. go for it.  #wishing that when you ask for a 20 on the 1-5 spiciness scale, that they'd give it a bit more effort.

Long looking N-scotts for excellent (and value-priced) sushi and teppanyaki. Unfortunately after a year, Sakura is still off to a slow start.  * angus beef grilled from kitchen or at your teppanyaki table is by far your best bet. great flavor and good quality beef! * beautifully hand-painted wall decor and carefully selected furnishings make this a one-of-a-kind and classy spot * great spot for your pre- or post-cine capri jam, especially if you love American-"Japanese" (could we say "Cal-Jap"?) rolls.  I wish I could end the review there, but if I did, I would not be telling it like it is. Owners are such wonderful people are very well meaning, but the consistency and organization is just (still) not there yet. !!! Please send your proud and stubborn kitchen chef off to west bell road where he belongs. He will cost you your business !!! I just want (and will pay for) the best quality and freshest fish. Anything less I will send back.  # overstocked food + rotation = the food which is actually served is never fresh. who are you saving it for?! # garde manger fridges are too cold -- are the prep dishes uncovered, I wonder? -- salad mixes are always just about to or just succumbing to frostbite # sushi fish is rarely fresh. wednesday is delivery day. with rotating stock, you still have to fight for the fresh stuff. # blechy seaweed, squid and octopus salds served in martini glasses.  STOP THAT, GODDAMIT. Martini glasses are for martinis! They stink! HOW can you serve me that old and decaying $#@! ? ## fried rice does not have corn kernels, mini carrot spheres or peas. stop that. there is no corn in japan. ## powdered black pepper is dangerous in large quantities. it can be (and was) accidentally inhaled and is very painful ## freezer-burned shrimp for fried rice is over-peppered, dry and rubbery  # lunch service almost always understaffed. one time, it was the poor guy's first day and there was no host, no manager, no floor manager, no barman and no busser. he did a great job of selling the 4 of us on draught beers, but the keg ran out after the 2nd glass. we (and the other tables, and our food at the pass, and the 2 four-tops who came in and then left when no one was there to greet them) waited for 10 minutes for him to reappear. what a shame!   i tried very hard to recruit away master chef hiromasa kyodasan from that hellhole (and double-x blacklist) abyss to the south which shall not be named, but it didn't work out.

Hohum food. Nothing special here except the view. Great spot for drinks and snacks. Patio seating during cool months.  # server actually warning me *against* what I asked for. Thanks a lot, but it's not a good sign. new chef needed? # sharp scampi drowning in wine. Blechy sauce reminds me of cheap gloppy Chinese lobster sauce. shrimps bouncy, approaching rubbery. # Chicken Caesar blabla nothing special at all # pasta served cool. Sauce greasy and not fresh. I can have cold-food-leftovers-style at home, GODDAMIT! # meatball sandwich uninspired, hohum.  Service was attentive despite other reviews here, but the pace was empty. Even the manager seems unconvinced about the ability of the kitchen to execute.  Great view of the golf course and surrounding area. Just wish the food packed the same wow factor.  Meh.

Friendly attentive service, but buffet choices are nothing special. Tandoori chicken dry, as in left-out-overnight-and-then-warmed dry...  --fruit custard is refreshingly and simply cool with bits of pineapple --naan basket is fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy, but bland ## rice wafer with potato filling not hot, and potato mix tastes of dishwasher rinse liquid ## star anise not removed from chicken biryani. Wow that's a powerful spice when tasted in the raw! FYI, I don't want to bite into a bouquet garni either! ## dental warnings should be given on donut-hole desserts... rock hard  Good value for buffet but wishing they would try a bit harder.

What a horrible mess. Bland, blinding (lighting) and chunky. Fish very moist but bland as hell without the squirt-bottle slather. 2 stars. Maybe for lunch?  i think they're trying to fill the hole left by Rumbi's departure across the street.  --cute upside-down wooden surfboard-like tabletops, but # the tables slip and slide easily on the floor. hang on to your dinner! # presentations completely off. feels like it started as a food truck and they forgot to upgrade the food when they found a permanent buiding. # who wants to eat a huge pile of food ketchup-bottle-squirted with goopy sauce all over the top? maybe if i'm standing at a street vendor in mexico! # get rid of the cash register and table numbers. you can do it better and cheaper with waiter service.  This place has huge competition in the immediate area. Maybe this concept works in Hawaii, but there is absolutely no beach to be found, and the only view I have is of the parking lot and the mexican restaurant next door.

unfortunately this place is not for the food. it's for the fun hip vibe and spot to see and be seen. with the proximity to light rail, it's the much-needed more upscale option to G&D at the Indian School stop. unfortunately it doesn't have the history or the camp yet to be OK with just mediocre food. 2 stars.  * great happy hour drinks and nice takes on classic drinks * excellent selection of liquor, anything which might tickle your general fancy  But THERE'S A REASON IT CAN BE SERVED FOR $5. ### sriracha kimchi chicken wings. epic fail. there's a reason i call it "stuff-me-full-of-antibiotics-so-i-don't-die-while-i'm-standing-in-my-own-shit-while-i-wait-for-the-growth-hormones-to-make-me-bigger-than-i-ever-was-supposed-to-be feed lot meat". It's slimy, it's fatty, it's huge and somehow wrong. and it bites like a sponge. mild kimchi and spicy wing sauce interests but one bite of that chicken and it's going back. BLECH.  ## pork belly ramen. #chewy pork belly reminds me of chicharron and not in a good way. # noodles are undercooked and the whole thing is just boring and bland. you could say it was "mild" but, no. ramen should be bursting with umami that makes your tongue swell up. # "soft" egg just more bore. no salt anywhere, not even at the table.  -- Kung Pao chicken. meh. with brown rice it was hearty, but just boring.  what a waste.
