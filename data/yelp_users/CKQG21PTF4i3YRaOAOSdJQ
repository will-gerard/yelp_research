I went here a couple friday's ago with friends. We all got the same thing the meat and cheese filled papusa meal. I love papusas and this place is legit on these. Im not a fan of black beans so I get the pinto beans with the meal. I ordered the horchata thinking it was going to taste like every other horchata I have had. El salvadorian horchata is not the same as your typical Mexican horcahata, and it was not to my liking. I took some food to go for Javier, but he said he was not a fan, may have been since it was not fresh. Beware when you go to this place, it is straight in the middle of the hood and looks sketchy. You drive to the back and park in the dark parking lot and enter through the back. Do not let this scare you away because the food is worth it.

I was sooooo excited about trying the famous Carolinas that I hear everyone speak about. I was ok that it was a run down looking place, was even willing to go in 115 weather knowing they only had swamp coolers, this is how bad I wanted to try it. I ordered the red chile and bean burrito. The red chile had no flavor and was not even a touch of spice. Either they forgot to put beans in my burrito or they put a very small amount. I was dissapointed in this burrito. I also ordered a dozen tortillas, heard these are sooooo good.  These were good and a huge size. I wouldnt go out of my way for these. I know plenty of other mexican bakeries that make good tortillas. I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go, but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food. I think alot of the good reviews were people who think taco bell is mexican food. Sadly dissapointed :(

I have been eating here for years, just havent had time for a review. First off I L O V E that they have a drive thru, it makes it easy for me to call in an order and pick up during my busy lunch hour. Lunch specials are great and you get alot of food for your money. I usually get the chicken chow mein or the orange chicken. both are delicious. The egg rolls and wontons are tasty as well,  sometimes I get dissapointed with bad eggrolls, not this place :) Fried rice is great and they give you wonton chips with your meal as well. I have no complaints thats why I have been going here since 2007 and will continue to go.

We went here yesterday for lunch, it wasnt packed at all and the lunch prices are good. They start you off with chips and salsa. Nothing special at all, I usually love chips and salsa but this salsa was straight up pace picante or somethng similar. Do not go to this place and expect authentic mexican food. We then ordered drinks, Javier had a margarita on the rocks, he loved it and was the perfect flavor and perfect amount of alcohol. We both then got the fajita lunch special, he got chicken with the flour tortillas and I got beef with corn tortillas. It came out in a small skillet but I think it was a perfect portion, I left not feeling too full. Javier on the other hand was too full. He ate the flour tortillas, which were very thick and looked like pancakes. I preffered the corn, not as filling and doesnt leave you stuffed. Im glad I tried this place, I will go back if Javier wanted to, but I wasnt impressed. I could make the same thing at home.

We went here on a saturday afternoon, the place was packed. We didnt know which beer to try so we went with the sampler. Came with 9 different beers plus 1 specialty one (rye wine). We really enjoyed the rye wine, this one was 12% . This was my favorite of the ones we tried. I also enjoyed hefeweizen  and javier liked the sunbru. I look forward to seeing this brewing company at Oktoberfest this year :) For the main course I had the Italian beef beer bread, which consists of Lean roast beef with saut√©ed red onion, green peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese and garlic honey mayo rolled in our fresh baked beer bread. The beer bread was tasty and comparable to a tortilla , but thicker, but not as thick as pita bread. I chose the pasta salad as the side. It was very tasty but looked disgusting, had a weird grey color to it. I like the presentation of my food to be just as good as the taste. Javier had the roasted turkey club with beer battered fries. His was delicious. I now wish I would have gone with the fries. The reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is 1. there was a swamp cooler in there so it was a lil hot. 2. doesnt have a good size parking lot so you have to park along side 8th ave and walk a lil bit to the place. Still wasn't too bad and not so bad that I wouldn't return again.

We went here on Sunday for Mother's Day. If you go out on this day it's a given that it's going to be busy. So I will not be judging service too hard. For the most part our service was great, waitress forgot a few things and we had to ask a few times but I'm sure she was under a lot of pressure with the place being so busy. I ordered the eggs Benedict and substituted my potatoes for a Pancakes for $1.00 more. We had ordered iced tea and when you do this they bring a carafe full of tea that way you can help yourself to more, I loved this, especially considering how busy it was. The eggs Benedict had a very delicious hollandaise sauce, I had no complaints with my meal it was delicious. I will return here again :)

Went here on Friday night with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. Was a great experience and I dont have one negative comment about Maggianos. I just wish they were closer so I could go more often :) We had a party of 8 and everyone loved what they ordered, the appetizers, cocktails, entrees and desserts were all faboulous. It took a lil longer than your typical Italian restaurant to get the meal out to us, this is to be expected when they are preparing everything fresh and with a large party group. The waitress was super attentive and had no issues with spliting all the checks up. Even though we had a large party they didnt charge us a forced gratituity, it was labeled on the receipt as a suggestion. We all didnt mind paying the suggested gratuity since our service was so great. I had a lemon drop martini, it was the best I have ever had and Javier had the Long island ice tea (also the best I ever had). I was so surprised of a restaurant that is a chain would be so great and care so much about the quality of the food and service. Can not be compared to your other chain Italian establishments. I will be returining for sure. If any one from Maggianos is reading this please consider opening up a location in Chandler, Im sure  you will recieve plenty of business.

I Love, love maggianos food and I don't care that it's a chain etc. We usually go here 2-3 times a year. The reason for the number of times being so low is because I live in Gilbert, that is about a 35-40 minute drive each way. The food was great this time as always (I have never had an issue with the food) however on this particular night, 5/30/15 they were doing a charity for a great cause "make a wish" foundation. I am all for charity and doing anything to help out, however when i go out to eat I still expect great service no matter the situation. We had to flag down our waiter several times, remind him to bring what we had asked for, and my daughter got a kids meal and we orderd a drink with it, that took 20 minutes to come out. He then came to our table and apologized and said the reason he wasn't attending to us like he usually does is because they are doing the event for charity  etc etc. So in other words you are telling me that our business or us as customers are not that important to you. It was not just our waiter but the whole staff seemed to be off their game that night. I witnessed 3 glasses being broken in a matter of an hour  one of incidents happened to be a class breaking from the 2nd floor and landing on a couple who was eating dinner at the table below.  I would like to make a suggestion, if ever you have a large party that needs special attending to, maybe only 2 of your waiters and  or manager should be servicing that table. Do not have your staff juggle that and on top of that all their other tables as well.  The service was just really horrible on this particular night. On top of not getting attended to like we normally do at Maggiano's,  we had an issue with the bill, (that one wasn't really a big deal, it was corrected, however could of been prevented if we  didn't have different servers coming to our table. We also made a reservation for 615pm, it Was a Saturday night and it is  always packed here, even with a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes and we were only a party of 3. I was really disappointed  in this night, I don't know when I will be returning again, I just hope that my favorite Italian restaurant doesn't end up  being this place that I used to go to that used to be really great.

We tried Fuego Bistro on a Saturday night. I have been hearing great reviews on this place and I finally bought a living social deal. I had made reservations in advance and we still waited about 25 mins to be seated, the host even forgot that we checked in. It seemed very busy that night and it's a small place to begin with so crowded as well. They may have been under staffed that night.  While we were waiting for our table we both had drinks, I had a coconut mojito and Javier had another specialty drink. They tasted great but there was very little alcohol in them, I would of liked some more in there for $10 per drink. Once we got seated we ordered and got our food, it came out faster than I thought considering how busy it was. Javier ordered the seafood Chile relleno with chipotle mashed potatoes and corn bread; I had the same sides with the cola pineapple soy short ribs. Our food was great and the portions were Huge. We had enough to take home and eat the next day. The food its self was so good I am willing to overlook the mishaps earlier in the evening. For dessert we had the Kahlua cr√®me brulee, this is my favorite dessert and this one did not disappoint me.  We will be going back again but not anytime soon, this is another issue. They only have patio seating which I normally love, but not during the summer in AZ. So we will be back when the weather permits.

I wanted to try this place since I always drive by it. We walked into the restsurant and I got a huge whiff of the worst smell in your life. We immediately walked out and went to Applebee's.  The food couldn't possibly be good.  I surprised thus place hasn't been condemned by now.

I'm glad that there is a good pizza place close by to my new home. Javier picked up a large Supreme pizza and 2 dozen wings.Everything was delivicious. The wings had enough sauce and the perfect amount of spice. And the flavor on the dough on the pizza was tasty. Supreme had sausage, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper and mushrooms. The kids picked off most of the toppings but we enjoyed everything on the pizza. We even had leftovers for Saturday night dinner and the wings and pizza were just as good reheated. Will be picking up pizza again from here in the near future :)

I wish I would of read the reviews before we ate here. I didn't pick out the place. We were wanting to eat sushi, I guess Tolleson/Avondale doesn't have a wide selection for this. We went during lunch hour and this place was dead, now I know why. It's not well lit and has annoying Japanese pop songs playing in the background. The women's bathroom was disgusting and I couldn't bring myself to use the facility. Then after seeing that, I had to go back to my table and eat the food. We ordered the spicy tuna. this didn't look like the spicy tuna rolls I usually get but it tasted good. Javier ordered teriyaki chicken and I ordered the teriyaki beef. Javier's chicken was good and the sauce was perfect. They doused my beef with too much teriyaki, it was overwhelming. We also got the miso soup, I usually love this soup, well at least at benihanna's . But this miso soup was too overwhelming as well, it's like they put a seasoning packet from the top ramen package and poured it in there. I will not be going back to this place, if you live in this area and in the mood for Japanese teppan, I suggest to skip this place and head to ah-so.

We went here for happy hour. I got the "oh me soy horny" roll, it had Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper. This has been by far my favorite roll I have ever tried. I had my daughter with me this day so I also got some orange chicken. This was a lil dry on the inside and didnt have too much flavor. My sister had the chuck norris roll, it had Spicy salmon and panko crusted shrimp inside, topped with sashimi salmon, avocado, fresh squeezed lemon juice and togarashi. She said hers was very tasty as well. We went here during happy hour. Our total bill was $30.00, this included 2 cocktails, 2 different rolls, orange chicken and another appetizer. I liked the happy hour alot, good prices and good vibe. This place is packed during happy hour but well worth the wait. I also been hearing that ther is an ipad at your table to order. I didnt see this anywhere so not sure if they no longer do or is this just at certain times?

We went here for dinner, I made reservations not knowing what to expect. No need at all to make them, its a walk in place and you just sit yourself at an available table. First impression of the place was, "oh no what did we get our selves into". The restaurant is inside the lobby of the sheraton and is open, so you can see anyone just walking around the hotel. We had dinner at 9:30pm so was not too much traffic but there was an entertainer convention going on, so was very noisy and then when they had an intermisssion we got to see some interesting looking people. It was a lil bit of some nice entertainment. I could see how that could be annoying with all the background noise. First off we started with some cocktails, I had the orange margarita with sugar on the rim, was delicious, and Javier had the house special Fire and spice, it tasted just like a classic margarita (nothing special). Appetizer: we shared the Gambas al fuego. So for $10.00 you get 4 shrimps, (they were delicious) but for $10.00 I expect a lil bit more food. It wasn't even the jumbo shrimp, just normal size. Besides the price and quantity, this dish was delicious. It had a mango salsa that was sooooo good. It had jicama, mango, red bell pepper, cilantro, chile and lime. I think i will try to recreate this at home. So Im glad this is the appetizer we chose, but I will not be getting it again just because of the portion. On a side note, they give you a basket of bread, which is actually soft pretzel sticks. and you get 3 condiments to dip it into.Oil (which I think needed some spices for more flavor), jalepno jelly (ya I know, but surprisingly good), and a sweet/nutty butter.  For the main course: I got the chorizo chicken (chicken stuffed with chorizo and cheese) with a chipotle sauce on top, it came wth ranchero beans( i didnt like these, but thats just my preference, I enjoy more authentic tasting beans) and jalepeno cheese rice, (this was very good, and the cheese dishes are made with white cheddar). Javier had the bbq short ribs (he loved these) and came with jalepeno mac n cheese( this was extra cheesey) , but very good. And finally I ordered dessert, creme brulee. Now I may not be the person to ask because this is my all time favorite dessert, but I have definaltly had better. There was nothing special to it. But I couldnt leave with out trying it. I will be returning here to try other menu items, I just with they would change the location or open up another location in the valley.

This place was horrible. We Went on lunch on Thursday and were the first customers.  We Got our drink orders and food orders taken care of right away.  Then nothing, no coming to refill our drinks or to let us know our food was going to take a while.  We got our food after 40 minutes we immediately asked for the checks and to go boxes.  The waitress apologized for how long everything took and still took a total of 15 minutes to check us out and give us our boxes.  My g Food was good, I got the spicy rigatoni.  My friends who got the spaghetti complained of the noodles having no flavor and the sauce tasted like just plain tomatoes with no seasoning at all. I called bucca to complain and they didn't answer and I'm still waiting to hear from corporate since Thursday.  very disappointed especially since this was a work birthday lunch.

Javier and I went here on Saturday night, the place was dead. Only 2 other tables and one of them were regulars. We ordered 2 different sushi rolls, the soy sexy roll, which consists of  Tempura Shrimp, Crab, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Cucumber / Soy Paper, Orange Sauce, Eel Sauce. I ordered this because it's very similar to a roll I love at blue wasabi called "me soy horny". Javier got the Las Vegas rolls ( he gets this one every time) it consists of Salmon, Avocado, Crab, Cream Cheese, Rice / Tempura Fried, Eel Sauce. This one was good as well, one of the better Las Vegas rolls I have had. The pieces were HUGE, this made it a lil difficult to eat without it falling apart. We were full off the two rolls, it was the perfect amount. I took a look at the happy hour prices, they weren't too great. The Las Vegas roll is $7.00 regular 10.00, and they didn't have my roll as part of happy hour. My only complaint is I wish the place was more live. I'm used to eating sushi at places like blue wasabi or Ra where it is always packed and playing good music. I will return to this place despite the atmosphere just because the rolls were so good.

This is my second time here and again I am not impressed. Maybe I'm not ordering the right things??? My first time I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, I think my problem was I was expecting it to taste like pei wei lettuce wraps. They were ok but pei weis are better. This time I got the beranise burger, thank goodness they put the sauce on the side because I was not a fan. The sauce was cold and was lacking flavor. The burger was good but not impressive. The highlight of the meal was the shoe string French fries. I ended dinner with the creme brulee, I loved that they put bananas on the top but then I was disappointed with the chocolate chunks on the bottom, it just threw off the flavor and texture. I don't know if I will be back. I love the idea of the meals on the menu, they are just not executed out well.

I have always heard great things about the keg,  I just don't know why I Haven't been sooner. We started off with cocktails, I had the apple orchard martini and Javier had the whisky sour. Both drinks were made perfectly and I have found a new happy hour spot. For dinner we ordered the Manhattan new York strip and the Kansas City strip. Javier steak was huge,both were perfectly cooked (we ordered medium) the mixed veggies were fresh and didn't taste frozen and our twice baked potato was creamy on the inside and toasty on the top. No complaints at all,  and I'm very picky when it comes to how my food should be prepared and taste. We ended with dessert, carrot cake with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream. Again no complaints and everything tasted perfect. I had a birthday coupon for 25.00 that you get when you sign up on the guest list.  Our total bill with the coupon was $63 I don't think that's bad at all for 2 drinks, an iced tea, 2 entrees and dessert. We will be back for sure . Also I recommend the patio while the weather is still nice.

I went here for dinner last night with my mom and daughter. I had a coupon for a free large one topping pizza, this was sent to me because it's my birthday month. This place is good! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and I love how the crust is thin but not crunchy and the cheese is creamy. Very good pizza, I usually only get the option of Peter piper since I have a 3 year old. As a starter my mother and I both had the Caesar salad, the dressing was very good and the lettuce and cheese on salad were very fresh. I will be going back here again, it's a lil pricey but I think it's worth it. Also here is a lil tip. From 4-5pm the restaurant redoes the coals in the brick oven, we got there at 430pm so we had to wait until 5pm for our pizza to be cooked, It wasn't too big of a deal but I don't suggest going in for a late lunch/early dinner if you're on a time constraint.

Ok so lets start off with that I was really excited to try this place. I have been on this cajun food kick since my unexpected cancellation of my New Orleans trip and having a big Mari gra pot luck at work. I read the reviews and saw nothing but good things about this place. Javier and I went here on a Friday about 2 weeks ago. We both ordered the same thing. ( I usually like to order different things so we can taste each others food). We had a shrimp po boy with seafood gumbo and sweet tea. Lets start off with the good. The po boy was delicious, I liked it alot. The portion was huge, we ordered the half one and it was still a very good size so I could imagine the full size one. The bread was toasty but not too hard and the sauce in the po boy had a really good flavor. I topped it off with some Louisianna hot sauce which made it just that much more better. Second, the sweet tea was delicious. I love that it was brewed tea not the typical fountain nestea kind filled with artifical flavor. Since Javier and I both dont drink sodas finding a good beverage alternative is always a plus. Ok and now for the bad, and I really hate to do this because I really wanted to like this place alot. Im picky in the kind of seafood I eat, so I asked the cashier what kind of seafood in the gumbo. Given that I was in there on a Friday during Lent this was the only kind available. They had told me only shrimp and crab, perfect since those are two kinds of seafood I actually like. So when we get our order the gumbo smells really fishy, not typical of shell fish. I look through it and it looks as there is crawfish in there as well. I know for sure I do not like crawfish and if they would have told me that was included in the gumbo I for sure would have ordered another side. This isnt even the worse part. In Javier's gumbo there was something green and slimey looking. We had no idea what it was, looked like it could have been octopus tentacles or fish guts. Really it was that wierd looking. I now wish I would have taken a picture of it just to find out what the heck it was. Now I can admit I am a hard person to please with food, Javier on the other hand will eat almost about anything. Now for something to make this man not finish his food has to be really bad. Also the place was kind of pricy, our total bill was $14.00 and that included a buy one get one free meal coupon from the Entertainment book and 2 drinks. Needless to say we will not be returning. Yes I loved the sweet tea and the po boy, this was not enough to return back or to spend our $$$ there.

I have had a bad experience with pho in the past. I tried this place by recommendation of a friend who I know knows his Vietnamese food.  We started off with egg rolls and then wet got the house fried rice. Both dishes were great and I loved the sauce they brought out with shredded carrots in it. *I'm not sure what it's called.  Then the real test the pho came out.  We ordered the large beef,  this was a huge portion so I recommend the regular size since this soup is only good eaten fresh.  The broth tasted good and the cut off beef wasn't too fatty like others I have had before.  I have had pho a total of 3 times so far and this place is by far the best.  I guess it's true, you need to go to the hood for good food

We went here Friday night for dinner.  When I first walked in I loved the atmosphere.  We started off with a guacamole appetizer.  The guacamole tasted very fresh and authentic, I would of liked a little more spice. I love horchata and order it whenever available.  I liked the touch of the cinnamon sprinkled on the top. My entr√©e was the chicken chiliquiles. This was a great meal and tasted good.  Again I love heat and there was none.  I will be returning, I will just special order and add jalepenos to my order. We ended our night with a strawberry Tres leches topped with ice cream, this was super moist tasted really good.  If your taking children they eat for free under the age of 10.

We went here around 10pm for dinner, so we had no issues with seating. To start off we ordered some capitols, bread with olive oil. The meat was very good and you could taste the quality. For our main dishes, javier got the prime rib sandwich and I got the Italian grindr. We decided to split each. The au jus dip for the prime rib was very good. I usually don't like prime rib because its too bloody but this was cooked to perfection and was still very moist. I enjoyed this sandwich very much. The Italian grinder was delicious also, good quality meats and the dressing was perfect, not too sweet. We were too full to try desert. They had a live band inside which we didn't mind but not cool for a first date, you couldn't here yourself speak over the music. I will go again,possibly for brunch

It's always nice to find a good delivery food place. This was the first time I have eaten gold chef, it was recommended by a friends who's food preference I trust. We ordered an order of orange chicken, chicken lo mein, crab ragoons and chose the fried rice as opposed to the white rice. The total was $23.00 for all of this food, this fed javier and I and we both were able to take leftovers for lunch. Delivery time was told would be 45 mins, it was actually only 15-20 minutes. Javier said he usually doesn't like orange chicken because too dry, this orange chicken was perfect, just enough sauce and a great flavor, they pack it with some fresh broccoli. Also I loved the chicken lo mein, it had lots of garlic flavor , one of the best lo meins I have had. The crab ragoons were ok, nothing special, would have liked to see some imitation crab in the mix. The only thing I can say I didn't care for was the fried rice, this was too dry and greasy.  We will be ordering from this place again for those nights I don't feel like cooking or when we get together last minute.

Javier and I went here on Saturday night. The good thing about this place is happy hour starts at 4pm and ends when the place closes. Good thing for you beer drinkers, they are super cheap. We shared all of our food that night. We started off with the ninja roll, this consists of crab and spicy tuna stuffed into a jalapeno topped with some eel sauce. This was our favorite!!!! We also had the pink lady and the scorpion. I love the inventive names of the rolls and the pink lady also had pink soy paper. Pink Lady, cucumber, avocado,Spicy crab, & Crunch Wrapped in soypaper w/ eel sauce & Spicy Mayo and Scorpion Roll, Shrimp tempura & cream cheese topped w/ kani, masago, eel sauce, & spicy mayo. We then shared the chicken hibachi meal for 10.99, consists of rice chicken and veggies and miso soup. This was horrible. there was too much sauce drenched on chicken and veggies. The miso soup made me want to gag. Rice was nothing special, just white rice also came with an orange that was tart. The four stars is based on the sushi here. DO NOT EAT THE REGULAR FOOD .  But sushi is terrific

We wanted to do something that would allow my daughter time to run around and hang out with other kids. I thought it was a great deal for $5. After dinner and shopping we arrived at 915pm. It closes at 10pm. When we were first greeted, we were asked how could they help us. Of course we came in to use the play area, we were then told by the young man in the front "Are you sure you want to pay, we close at 10pm" I think if a customer comes in willing to try out your facility you should have some better customer service skills. I knew the facility hours and I think $5 is not a bad price to pay for 45 minutes of play time.Some customer service training may be needed to avoid future loss of business. Desert Ridge has many options for us to enjoy, our business will be going else where in the future. The only reason I gave this facility 2 stars is beause my daughter did have a good time.

I tried this place for the first time last Friday during happy hour. This is a cute and quiet spot. We ate inside because of the heat, but I can't wait to go back to sit on the patio they have. Started off with a glass of white sangria with peaches. Happy hour price of $4.00, this was so good. I was only able to drink half the glass since I was driving and it was very strong. I am looking forward to enjoying this again when I have a driver :). For appetizers we shared artichoke and spinach dip, it came with some toasted bread. This was the most delicious artichoke/spinach dip I have ever had. We also tried out some bruschetta. I had the one with prosciutto, mozzarella and pesto sauce. And also the one with green apples, brie and fig jam. I have no complaints about this place, service was great, food was good and happy hour prices were decent. I also loved the decor. I can't wait to go back and sit on the patio, enjoy some more sangria and taste the flatbread that looked A M A ZI NG . Our total bill for 3 glasses of sangria and 2 appetizers came out to $33.00, not bad at all.

I have been seeing my friends check-ins to this place and have always wanted to try it. I went with my friend Monica and ordered 10 wings; lemon pepper and the other half were hot with some sweet tea. The sweet tea was way too sweet so I'm assuming the kool aid is also, yes they have kool aid!! I usually get my wings from long wongs which only takes cash so it can be a pain. I loved this place!!!  Loved that even though I only ordered 10 wings I could do split flavors , and they were crispy wings and great flavor. I wish there was a location here in tempe so I can go here for lunch

This is my 2nd time here and both times I was not disappointed. Get there early because the lines do get long but it's worth the wait. I got the carne asada tacos and mini quesedillas, total of 4 tacos and 2 minis at 8.00 is a great price. This fed both javier and I. They are not skimpy with the meat and it has lots of flavor. The red salsa also has a good kick to it. I will continue to go back.

I have been here two times so far and I will be going back soon. I have yet to try a doughnut, I know who goes to golden doughnut and not have a doughnut. There are many more things here than doughnuts. On my first trip I had a plain croissant toasted and a watermelon smoothie. The croissant tatsted fresh and was flaky, warm and delicious. The watermelon smoothie actually tasted like real watermelon in my drink. They also have lunch sandwiches here, so my 2nd visit I had a turkey croissant sandwhich. It was so good, everything tasted fresh, I also got one for my friend and she said the best sandwhich ever. I love that they are 24 hours and have a variety of a selection for breakfast and lunch. I

There isn't a pita jungle in this area but now that I found pita kitchen I don't mind at all.  I had the chicken swarmaza (not sure how to spell it) with a Greek salad.  The chicken was moist and had so much flavor.  They even offered gold peak tea *my favorite.  Javier had the beef gyro with fries. He said it tasted good but next time will get the salad instead of the fries. We also shared some baklava. I have had better but I'm willing to try  It again especially since baklava is one of my favorite desserts.

This place is a good place for something sweet or a small meal. I LOVE nachos, and I usually get that. I either get the carne asada ones or the ones that you eat straight out of the chip bag. They also have great mango with chile and lemon. And good agua frescas. I will contine going here, the place is usually packed and very limited seating situation. I hope they will soon open a bigger establishment out of the mall. Untill then I will continue to go to this location.

I wanted to like this place. I'm a huge supporter of great non chain establishments.  I got a chili coney dog fries and as folks in the Midwest call it pop. The coney and fries weren't terrible, they just weren't great. I saw that this place had 5 stars and was expecting more flavor. I'm an Arizona native so maybe I have different taste then Detroit cuisine.

We went here for brunch. Everything was amazing. I had the Sonoran crepes and a bloody mary. I asked them to make it spicy. This is the best bloody Mary I have had.  The crepes were soo good I finished every last bite. Reasonable prices also.  Our total bill was around $30 not including tip. That included 1 entree, alcohol beverage and 2 kids meals. I will be going back in the near future.

This is my third time here, first time reviewing. We always go through the drive thru. I have never had an issue with my order or customer service. I'm usually not a fan of chicken tenders, these are the best and even with the drive home they are crisp and warn. I don't know what they put in the sauce but it's the best. I could go on and on about foods that are the best here, cole slaw, sweet tea and lemonade. This is one of the tastier fast food picks. This is a must try

We went for lunch today,  I had the chile roast beef taco  with rice and pinto beans. I like how they made the tortillas fresh in front of you.  The meat had a great flavor. The rice and beans were nothing to write home about.  While we were ordering I saw the group in front of us ordering chicken and beef nachos.  Those looked delicious,  I wish I would of gotten those.  For every nacho order that is placed the whole crew will sing "nacho nacho man" song. Javier got the Chile beef burrito enchilada style.  He said it was a little small but that thing looked huge. The taste of it was really good.  It's a little different then chipotle, which I'm getting tired of anyways.  I will be going back soon for those nachos.

I have no idea why this place has so many stars. I wish I would of just ate at amc espenade now. First, it took so long to have our waiter greet us and get our drink orders. This was my first time here, my friends had been at the original Blanco several times.  They were craving the nachos.  Now typically when a menu item has been changed either your server will tell you or the menu will state the change.  Neither happened in this situation.  My friends didn't like the taste of the nachos and they specifically asked for no cream on them.  It came with cream on the bottom and both girls are lactose intolerant.  This ruined the dinner. The nachos were sent back and my friends had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  My meal was the short rib tacos.  These were actually good but this is AZ and good tacos are expected anywhere.  They claimed I was getting borracho beans. These beans were just refried and not smashed all the way.  I will not be reccomending this place and to have a restaurant in such a nice location you have to really step up your game Blanco

This place was good,  the taste of food was more 3 stars but the staff made it a 4. If this is your first time here I recommend eating here.  They explain to you the cuts of meat and let you sample before you purchase. The meat was good,   were always in search of good bbq (especially since javier isn't a bbq msster). The sides were nothing special,  however javier did like the green Chile. One thing we didn't like was you wait in line and order and there is no waiter, if you decide you want something else you have to go back in that long line.  Next time we will just take the meat to go and cook our own sides at home.
