I posted a review on Danny's car wash and 20th Street and Highland, I had the shittiest service by the biggest fattest dumbest Mexican what the biggest attitude I've ever met. I have to say I was just at the Tatum and cactus Danny's and had probably the best service I've ever had even when Daniel in the business. Are very polite did exactly what they said they were going to do my car came out very clean. I will never ever go back to the Danny's car wash on 20th Street and Highland unless somebody contact me and say that they have fired that fat Mexican.

I give Jackson's car wash 1 year before they're out of business. I've been at their Raintree location, they're Tatum location and today I was at there Highland location. There is a fat slob named Tiny that thinks he's all that, he walks around throwing his fat around he's the most f****** ignorant son of a bitch I've ever encountered. I have had nothing but s***** service from Jackson's car wash since they took over. I am really sorry to see Danny Hendon sell Danny's car wash. The service has gone down tremendously, as I have had nothing but s***** service at all three locations. I have tried to reach Jackson's car wash main office, but they will not take your call nor will they return your call. I can't wait for them bastards to go out of business!
