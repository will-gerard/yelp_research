I WILL NEVER RENT FROM HERE AGAIN!! This is the first time I have ever rented a car in my hometown because I recently moved and I haven't changed my license yet. The guy at the counter told me I had to get the insurance with them because I didn't have insurance card on me to prove my insurance, which is a complete LIE!!! That total was $125. When I picked up the car, the tank was half full and I asked the attendant at the gate to note it. When I returned the vehicle with the same amount of gas, they charged me $50 for the other half of the tank that was never there to begin with! Worst experience renting a car I've ever had!!!

I stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend as we were driving up Central Avenue looking for a place for brunch. It's perfect if you're looking for a relaxing, tasty experience that won't be expensive. They serve sandwiches for breakfast and lunch with fantastic side dishes. My favorite sandwich is the one with ham, brie, apricot jam, and almonds! I have been back multiple times and I have never had something I did not like. The absolute best thing there is the kale salad, which seems crazy I know, but they dress it up so well that the kale is soft and sweet. I could eat multiple bowls of it in one sitting (this coming from someone who despises kale in most settings.) The owner always comes to check on how we liked everything and sometimes brings us the sandwiches when they're ready. They have a nice patio with outdoor seating and the front of the store opens up so everyone can enjoy the morning breeze. Overall this place consistently provides delicious food and awesome service!

I got a recommendation to try this place from a foody friend who has been to their other location in Tempe. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves French-style breakfast and pastries! They serve breakfast all day on Saturday and Sunday so even if you get a late start you can still get breakfast.  As soon as we walked in and started looking at the menu the owner approached us and explained every item on their menu. She was very friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly and was to die for. I ordered the French scramble- the eggs are light, fluffy, and packed with flavor! It also comes with fantastic peppered bacon! As a thank you for trying out her restaurant the owner sent us two complimentary croissants, one chocolate and one almond, which were also mind-numbingly delicious. Will definitely be going there for breakfast again!
