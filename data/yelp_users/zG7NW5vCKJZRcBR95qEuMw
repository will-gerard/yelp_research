3.5 stars, but I've rounded up.  I've been coming here for years...and I keep coming back.  Its known for the noodles and I'd recommend the ramen (nothing like the packaged stuff you get for 20 cents, and you'd stock up and eat three times a day as a starving student).  I also love the udon noodles.   If you're more of a rice person, the unagi (freshwater eel) rice box is my husband's favorite.  But a recent price jump in the price (it used to be 11, and now is 17) is making him change his mind about what to order.  The sushi is decent, but this is not a sushi house, so keep that in mind.  The complimentary bread is awesome (although they don't give banana bread anymore, and that really was my favorite).  Lastly, as others have said the service isn't the best.  It's a bit slow, and they're always very crowded.  But take your time and enjoy the company you're with and you'll be fine!

I've been here a few times and unfortunately its never been a great experience.  I think the first time it was a three star, but the last time was definitely a two--maybe even a one and a half star.  The service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large party with three kids, but it they clearly weren't busy and it was a weeknight.  It took them about 20 minutes to get a table together for us, which was fine.  But then it took them about another twenty minutes to take our orders.  We were so hungry we ended up devouring four baskets of chips before we even placed our orders.  The chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.  It definitely wasn't anything to drool over.  It was edible, but not great.  Plus its not even super cheap.    Its a pass.

I am usually quite stingy with my five star rankings, but this place deserves one of them!  My husband and I came here to celebrate our 6 month anniversary and were impressed.  I ordered the lobster with risotto, but wanting something heartier, my husband leaned toward the lamb shank.  However, he's not a fan of couscous and although the menu says that substitutions are kindly refused, we asked our waitress and she didn't hesitate to give us other options.  So don't be discouraged, it pays to ask!  We had mashed potatoes instead, and it was fantastic.  The lamb shank was hearty, fork melting goodness with a great red wine sauce.  The lobster was perfectly cooked so that it didn't get close to rubbery, but didn't make you feel like you were eating sushi.  The risotto was creamy and a perfect balance to the light lobster.  Lastly, we had a terrible time trying to decide which tarte to try, finally, having the four berry tarte with ice cream. If we hadn't been so full, we probably would have ordered more than one. The tarte came out piping hot, with melty ice cream on top.  The crust was perfect, not too sweet, and crumbly.    Make sure to make reservations and save room for more than one tarte!

Been buying birthday cakes from here forever!  They are fantastic.  Fresh, light and healthy---well, at least you feel like its healthy since it has fruit and light airy cake.  Plus the owners are very sweet and believe in customer service!  I called yesterday to order a cake for today (a half sheet fresh mango cake), and they said that they might not have enough fresh ripe mangoes for a half sheet.  But since that was the cake I wanted, they said they would go out and purchase mangoes (ripe) to make the cake in time!  That was super sweet of the owner to go out of his way to help me out!   If you haven't been yet, stop by and dig into some deliciousness!

This place is known for their chicken fried steak.  And they certainly do it right.  They have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of chicken fried steak they have served....now that's confidence in your product!  But if you feel like something else, they have an amazing prime rib (you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out, they run out).  If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.  You won't regret it.  It's amazing!!    Don't expect some fancy schmancy steakhouse--but go hungry and you won't regret your decision to go there!

Two words: Amazing service!  My husband and I were super worried because we smelled some musty smells coming from the A/C vents, and since we have a new baby I immediately was scared of mold in our house!  My husband called Sun State Refrigeration and Dorena was professional and nice.  Sun State Refrigeration was not only quick and prompt (they came to our house that within hours of our call), but they were professional and thorough with their examination and cleaning of our unit.  Luckily, we ended up not having mold, however, our unit was in need of a heavy duty cleaning.    Mark was amazing!  He went in and explained everything that was going on with our unit to my husband.  I had thought the unit had been cleaned when we first moved in four years ago, but it turns out that the original folks we hired had not done a thorough cleaning.  I am so glad that we called Mark and Sun State Refrigeration.  I now feel confident that my system is clean and my baby is safe!  I would recommend Sun State Refrigeration to everyone who wants an honest, hardworking and professional company to work on your A/C!

Absolutely the best dining experience I've had.  From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food, I can see why it's the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona.  Don't get me wrong, you pay for the experience, but I believe it's worth the price (this coming from a very frugal person who tries to find discounts wherever she can).    My husband brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we sat down, we were treated wonderfully.  We ordered the suckling pig torta as an appetizer (portions aren't huge, but extremely flavorful and definitely enough to satisfy).  The appetizer was great, as a matter of fact...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  As entrees we ordered the lobster, scallop, and shrimp over squid ink pasta with gruyere cheese on top, and the buffalo tenderloin with mushrooms.  Both were amazing.  The lobster was no doubt the best dish I've ever had.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and deliciously rich but not heavy.  The buffalo was surprisingly not gamey and had a great fresh taste without being dry for such a lean cut of meat.    We want to go back and try one of the tastings, but for 200 per person, we may need to wait for a bigger celebration to go.  But I'm already plotting the next time I'll be back for another mind blowing experience.

Great service!!  I love coming here for my mani/pedi.  The nail techs are always so nice and friendly.  They have a great color selection for regular and gel nails.  My pedicures always come out fantastic and if you spring for the design, it's well worth it!  I never tell them what to do for the design and my toes always come out great!  I always get compliments on my toes.  If you want to pamper yourself without having to pay an arm and a leg doing so, head on down to Liberty Nails!

Two numbers you need to remember, 75 (roast pork sandwich)& 36 (vermacilli noodles with roast pork and egg roll).  I still adore this place, and tolerate being ignored for refills of water.  This place has cleaned up a bit--but its still definitely a hole in the wall type of restaurant.  Don't expect any great atmosphere and service, but do come hungry and ready to have some of the best roast pork sandwiches ever!  For under $3, its the best deal ever and I still haven't found a place that makes it better.  If you're feeling like noodles, number 36 is stellar!  The only con- it closes early, so eat early and often.

I've been coming to this place since college, and I can tell you its definitely one of those "an oldie but a goodie".  So, its not a fancy schmancy place with hip party music playing and it doesn't serve mixed drinks with cute names like "hello kitty", but it should be a staple to anyone's lunch place repertoire.    They serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.  Who says you can't eat good for cheap?

3-2-1 Three words:  Bucket of Clams, Two words:  Happy Hour, One word:  Fantastic!  Fresh seafood for awesome prices.  Fresh oysters on the half shell are $1.50 each.  They were soooo good.  We ordered two each, and then two more each, and then another two.  Do yourself a favor, and just order at least 6 for each person.  The bucket of clams for $13--so fresh--so good.  The clams are steamed and comes with clam juice and butter to dip, super simple, super delicious.  The shrimp toast is also a must--for $3.50 you'll never look at toast the same again!

I wish Fujiya was closer to me now that I'm no longer a student at ASU.  The best bento boxes and rice balls (onigiri).  Plus they have my favorite brand of milk tea (kirin), it's not cheap, but what Japanese thing is?  Totally worth it by the way.  Everyone should go and try it.  Don't expect this place to carry everything you'd want (it's pretty small), but it has most of the basics and even some things that other places don't carry.

If I could give negative stars, I think I actually would in this case. Our experience was THAT bad. I was in Las Vegas with my husband and family and we were craving some pho. We happened upon this place and we thought how bad could it be? People can't really mess up pho THAT bad. Boy, were we wrong.   It was bad right from the start, the restaurant smelled funny, like a family of wet dogs decided to take up shelter there. The service was horrible and when the waitress finally came by to take our order, she was extremely pushy, basically forcing us to order an appetizer even though we didn't really want to. We ended up getting the sticky rice with roasted chicken, which was okay, but we had felt extremely pressured to order it. The waitress then had the gall to come back and tell us that we should order another appetizer and proceeded to almost place the order for us, until we had to almost scream no, and say that we just want our entrees.   I ordered the vermicelli noodles with roasted pork and an egg roll. This is a staple dish for me at Vietnamese restaurants, and I have never been so sorely disappointed. First, it took FOREVER for the them to bring us our entrees (and it's not like they were busy, there were about three tables that night), and when they did I almost wished they hadn't. The noodles were hard. The pork was tough, poorly seasoned and looked like the leftovers from someone else's meal. The egg roll was the only halfway decent thing in the bowl, and it was tiny. I could barely finish 1/4 of the bowl, and it wasn't because I was full.   It wasn't even cheap. I know other reviews have said this place is a cheap eat. That was not my experience. My vermicelli noodles were $8, and it is usually $5-$6 at other restaurants. I wouldn't mind paying a couple bucks more if it were good. Or even halfway decent. But it was absolutely appalling.   We finally left the place disappointed, disgusted and hungry. I hope I can save the rest of you from this place. Run away immediately.

Decent dim sum in Vegas not too far from the strip.  Is it CA or NY quality dim sum, no.  But is it fairly good and reasonable?  Yes.  If you just can't seem to stave off a craving for dim sum in Las Vegas or tired of all those fancy (ie. expensive) restaurants owned by celebrity chefs, this is a good choice.  The selection is pretty good, and everything was the right temperature, the hot things were hot, and the cold were cold (which is really important to me).  There can be lots of people there on a weekend lunch hour (Asians love their dim sum), but the place is pretty big, and you'll be seated fairly quickly.  This is definitely my go-to dim sum place in Vegas.

I come here for lunch as a quick downtown sit down spot.  The sandwiches are good and they come with a side of either salad, fruit salad or chips.  I always order one of three sandwiches (the prosciutto, the pulled pork or the pastrami)  All great, all with a salad, that has fresh sliced parmesan and pinenuts.  Already a winner in my book!  The dessert crepes are huge and need at least two people to work on it after an entree.

I'm a sucker for hash browns. And boy does this place do them right.  They are almost like a potato pancake, but even better.  Perfectly crispy, salty, greasy, but not overly greasy.  Everything else was just the cherry on top of the sundae.  Came here on Friday afternoon (around 1ish) and it was still packed.  We still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad.  The place definitely needs to bogart a few more buildings and expand.  But we sat at the counter and bar stools which made me love my hashbrowns even more.  The griddlecakes were alright.  Nothing to rave about.  The rueben was good, a little too much sauerkraut for my taste, but others loved it.  The three egg scramble looked fantastic, and by the evidence of the licked-clean plates of my friends, it was a winner.  Definitely worth a 30 minute wait in my book.  A 2 hour wait?  Eh, probably not.  Even if those hash browns are calling my name right now.

Extremely inexpensive.  The breakfast menu doesn't exceed 7 bucks.  It's clean, friendly, and a nice neighborhood cafe that's in a stripmall that overlooks Indian School.  So if you sit outside, does it feel like you've been magically transported to Paris?  No.  But for these prices, its worth sipping your coffee, munching on your croissant and tolerating the fumes of the cars driving by.

I'm amazed that I haven't been here sooner--except for the fact its super hidden and would not know it was there unless you went looking for it. Well, go look for it! It was worth the search. I went with my family and first off: the portions are huge! We had the empanadas to start. Very good- crispy, not too spicy, wonderful flavors. We shared the braised short ribs and pulled pork with creamed corn, mashed potatoes, cornbread casserole and baby carrots. Absolutely divine! The flavors all melded together perfectly and was filling but not greasy.   If you haven't been yet, go check this place out. Its a real treasure worth the hunt.

We had been waiting to go here for a very long time.  I had heard such great things and since Binkley's had consistently made lists for best dining experience, I was eagerly awaiting the day I'd dine here.  To celebrate our 9 year dating anniversary, my (now) husband surprised me (well as much as he could, since it takes a good 45 minutes to drive there) by taking me here.    We arrived and it was a nice night, so we thought we'd sit outside on the patio (which isn't the best choice it turns out, since its fairly close to the road, and you can hear/smell the cars driving by).  The menus had our names and happy anniversary which was a nice touch.    Service: Our waiter seemed nervous or unsure of himself.  He faltered on the ingredients and some of the items throughout the night.  We would also have to ask to have our water to be refilled and wait some time before it actually happened.  There were lots of other staff that would bring out other dishes, but they weren't very friendly and would often not actually interact.  Mostly just bring the dish and describe without a smile and leave.   Food: We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect.  The amuse bouche were interesting, but I wouldn't say that I was all too impressed.  They were not particularly tasty bites.  For the ala carte, my husband ordered the veal, and we were quite disappointed.  The meat was tough and quite bland.  The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though.   For the tasting menu, I understand that portions are smaller (and I don't eat large portions), but they were ridiculously small.  I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer, soft shell crab for the hot, rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish.  The rib eye was super thin, and almost like beef jerky.  Although the flavoring was decent, it was so small and tough that it was a bit hard to eat.  I was just not super impressed and borderline disappointed by everything.  I would like to say I want to come back, and I'm not sure if Binkley's just had an off day, but we were very disappointed by our experience, especially since we had such high hopes.

One of the few Chinese restaurants that I'd recommend in Phoenix.  It has proven time and time again to be consistently good.  Its a bit more on the expensive side for Chinese food (but you have to understand that I usually demand cheap good eats), but overall I think the food is worth the slight premium.  Especially since its one of the few restaurants that is actually located in Northeast Phoenix opposed to Chandler or the Westside.    I recommend the French style beef cubes, snow pea leaves, and walnut shrimp.  But really most dishes are delicious.  The decor is not super impressive, but clean.  And the service is a bit lackluster, but the food is what you go for and the food is good.  Happy eating!

Not all tortillas are made equal, and there is no question that Carolina's makes the best ones.  They're huge, not super greasy, and perfectly made so that they don't break even when they are overfilled with goodies inside.  I'm partial to stuffing my tortillas with green chile and chorizo w/ potato, but even if you just fill those tortillas with only cheese, you've still got yourself a real treat.  Do yourself a favor and skip the Mission tortillas at the grocery store, and pick up a dozen at Carolina's!

Nice brunch on a beautiful day.  The place was still pretty packed at noon (they close at 1pm).  We ordered the eggs benedict, All American breakfast and egg white omelet.  Everything was very good. I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't try the egg white omelet (it has portabello mushrooms in it).  But the benedict was tasty and teh all american breakfast came with a great biscuit that was super flaky.  Portions are not huge, but satisfying.  Its nice to be able to sit under large historic trees and enjoy the weather and company.  For those who have dogs you can bring them there!  Its a bit on the the pricey side (its no 2.99 special at Denny's), but you pay for the relaxing atmosphere.

If you want pretty good sushi for a killer deal, this is the place.  Is the fish so fresh that I can still taste the ocean?  No.  But, is it fresh enough for me to crave it and drive 40 minutes (one way) just to go eat it.  Yes.    You can do an all you can eat "man v. food" style sushi deal for $20 (If two or more people at your table order this, you also get a sashami platter for free).  Or you can do a half off happy hour menu that is pretty good.  Plus you get miso soup, salad, edamame and hot towels.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have a great tempura selection and large portions for hot dishes.  Great for those who are sushi lovers, and those who just want to stuff themselves silly.  Time to see how much sushi you can really eat.

So here's my beef with Cork:  A group of friends took me out to Cork for my birthday dinner.  It was a Sunday night around 7:30pm.  The restaurant was near empty (there was one other group of 6 next to us).  The service was only okay, with so few people in the restaurant I would have expected top notch service.  However, we would often have to flag down our waiter just to get more water or bread.    We were then told that Cork's protein portion tend to be small.  Well, we found that the entire dish was extremely small, not just the protein.  I will say that most of the dishes were innovative.  We ordered six dishes to share amongst five people.  We had the hanger steak, waygu strip loin, antelope, duck, lamb chop, and pork belly.  I thought the first four were quite tasty, the lamb chop was nothing special, and the pork belly was lack luster.  However my biggest issue was that for the price ($23-$30 each) the portions were extremely underwhelming, we really needed to order about three entrees each in order to be somewhat full.  The desserts were probably the best part.  We ordered the banana cream pie, black and white cake and chocolate with espresso gelato.  I'd order the banana cream pie again.  After scarfing down six plates of bread, six entrees, three desserts, many pitchers of water, and $300 later we were talking about the next restaurant to go to so we'd be full ( the dollar menu at McDonald's was thrown out a couple of times due to our wallets being empty after this meal).  I'd try happy hour but I think dinner won't be an option next time.

This has become my go-to for a "nice, but not overly pricey--fancy, but not crazy black tie affair fancy" restaurant.  First, its located inside the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch which is a beautiful hotel and worth visiting just to listen to the live music.  I'd recommend ordering the ribeye for you meat lovers out there.  It's incredibly tasty, perfectly cooked and has a great sauce.  Also it comes with a side of your choice and I find the meal to be quite a good deal.  If you're not into the red meat, I'd also recommend the shrimp pasta.  That was fabulous.  The sauce was rich, but not too rich, and the shrimp were huge.  Lastly, for dessert if you like creme brulee, you have to get their signature gondola--its a huge plate of creme brulee with a cookie and chocolate gondola on top.  It's beautiful and delicious!  As an added bonus, when you dine at Alto, they give you complimentary "tickets" (they look like postcards), for a free gondola ride over by the lake.  A nice touch to end the evening, or you can even save the cards and come back at a later date to enjoy the ride.  Its a fun little activity that you normally wouldn't think to do in Scottsdale, AZ.

Very friendly family owned place.  The breads and desserts are great and freshly baked each day!  They get very busy, but the service is quick and you can always be certain that you're getting a great deal.  Everything is so inexpensive!!    You often see lots of people speaking different languages and having a grand ole time.  Great bakery and cafe and its always wonderful to see a family owned establishment that cares about their community.

Two dollar tacos?  Yes, please!  Two dollar tacos with great flavor and ingredients.  I'm all in!  I've only been here for lunch, since it's not too far of a skip from downtown.  Service hasn't been an issue for me, but I know it has for others.  I found parking to be a pain, try to find street parking if you can, but good luck.  The tacos are small, so you'll need around three.  Order a side of beans and rice and you have an awesome meal.  I love the carne asada and pork tacos.    I say stick with two dollar tacos during lunch and you'll leave happy!

So after months of hearing rave reviews (some on Yelp!), I finally got the chance to devour all the delicious food here. We started with the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer. So good, and tender. Perfectly crispy with a light coating. We had the fried mozzarella salad, basically a great salad with a giant mozzarella ball that was deep fried sitting in the middle of a bed of lettuce. How can that not be good?   For entrees we had the yukon potato pizza, burger and pesto pasta. Yum. The pizza was light, great crust, but probably could have used a bit more sauce. The pesto pasta was delicious, with these roasted tomatoes that were to die for. The portion was a bit small, so I'd order it if I wasn't too hungry. And the best was the Gorgonzola burger with these perfectly seasoned fries. Juicy, rich, and mouth-watery good.   We couldn't leave without getting some dessert. We had a the Italian chocolate cake (with cherries), and banana fritters. The banana fritters were my favorite--they were like little balls of banana cake fried to perfection. They came with two dipping sauces that were heavenly.   I'd definitely go back to the Parlor and will be trying more goodies!

A must stop place every time I'm in Vegas.  Its an all you can eat Korean food glutton's heaven.  There is a pretty good variety of meats that include beef, pork, and seafood.  But really, who gets beyond the Kalbi (beef short ribs).  The Kalbi was perfectly marbled, seasoned, and since you cook it right in front of yourself, perfectly cooked!!    The sides aren't anything too special, but they have your standard ten types of kimchi that vary from spicy to very spicy.  There's a huge rice cooker full of different types of rices and different soup offerings too.  Great place to go with lots of people and you can be super loud and it doesn't matter.    Hm...okay, gotta run, just thinking of this place makes me want to plan my next Vegas trip.

I'm so very sad about the review I have to write about this place.  I was so excited to go to Petite Maison.  I had gone to the Yelp event at the Science Center and was absolutely floored by how delicious the beef tongue with bone marrow au ju was at PM.  I immediately made a reservation for the following week to go to the real deal.    We had a reservation for six people at 7pm.  We all arrived and were seated outside, which was fine since it was a beautiful night.  However, it took forever for our waiter to come acknowledge us.  Finally after about 10 minutes, he comes over and takes our drink orders and recommend some specials.  We ordered the mussels and scallops as appetizers and ordered our entrees.  Four of us wanted the duck breast, but they only had three left, so one of our friends ordered the pork tenderloin.  About ten minutes later he brings us some bread (almost like eggy popovers, very good), but he only brought out five, so we asked for one more since not all of us got to try it.  After about another 10 minutes, he does--by this time we all need a refill on our drinks but get no attention.  We get our appetizers finally, and they are pretty good.  The mussels are cooked perfectly with a nice light broth and the scallops are in a creamy white sauce.  Fast forward another 30 minutes and we finally get our main entrees.   The steak frites was eh.  Left much to be desired.  The steak was slightly tough and mostly flavorless and the frites were limp.  The duck breast (times three) was good, cooked just right, but the risotto was surrounded by a lake of broth which made it too soupy for some of us.  The pork tenderloin was on the dry side and not that great.  The last was the salmon which was "interesting".  It was an odd combination of flavors which didn't make it bad, but wasn't out of this world.  Half way through out entrees we flagged our waiter down (since he never came over to see how we liked our food), and ordered dessert--the souffle requires 15 minutes--turns out it was more like 30 minutes.  Finally around 10pm we got our dessert, two souffles and french two cream puffs.  They were good-but after having to wait basically an hour between the appetizer, entree and dessert, I was just looking forward to getting out of there.  We basically had to wave our hands in the air constantly to get anyone to come over to get anything.  What made it worse was that since we were a party of 6, we had 21% gratuity automatically added.  I can't help but wonder if that's why they chose to ignore us all night.  I hope others have better experiences here.

Another place that needs to think about expanding.  A very tight space, with a limited entree menu, but worth the hassle and hype.  The jidori chicken with spaetzle dumplings and broccilini was heavenly.  The rock shrimp came out fried like popcorn shrimp.  But it was so much better than what you'd expect from popcorn shrimp.  The batter was light, almost non-existent, shrimp was tender and juicy and it was pared with a dipping sauce you'd want to dip everything with.  The Tuscan kale falafel didn't disappoint and was a good starter.  The trout and fennel salad was a good combo of flavors that I didn't expect to be good, but was.  Overall, a great place to try different small dishes and share.  The entree selection was limited to four items so I'd say it's not a place for large parties.  But bring your favorite two or three people and have a good ole time!

Tried Torched Goodness at Food Truck Fridays.  They were out of the sea salt caramel (flavors are seasonal and they run out quickly, so you have to get there early!), so we opted for the Rose Water.  It wasn't a flavor that I'd usually pick, but it was unique so I figured why not?    The layer of sugar was a bit too much for me--it was a little too thick--but that quickly gave way to the perfect creamy center that was infused with flavors of rose in a fantastic way.  I didn't think I'd like it, but now I can't believe I hesistated to order it!  For $4, this will be a regular treat for sure.  Now, I'm off to see where they are right now...

Yummy!  Went straight here on a wet, rainy night after driving into Vegas from Arizona.  It was packed! Even at 9:30pm, but they were able to get the four of us in within 15-20 mins, which wasn't too bad.  I'd recommend going with one other person rather than a large group though.  The place is pretty tiny, and the smaller tables turn quicker, and you also usually have the option to sit at the bar.  I ordered the tonokatsu ramen and it was definitely worth the wait.  The soup was deep in flavor, delicious, and pork was extremely tender and yummy.  The soup was just a tad salty for me, which made me want to order more ramen (which you can do), to soak up all the yumminess.  If it were just a little less salty, I probably would have just stuck a straw in it.  I will definitely be coming back during my future visits to Vegas!

I think this place gets the stars for using willing to place spam on their menu and for piling fruit on a hot dog.  It's definitely a place that you must try so that you too can say that you've had coconut, pineapple and chili on a hot dog.  For about 5 bucks a dog, loaded with so many goodies, you'd wonder why ballparks only have ketchup, mustard and relish.  The spam slider was spamalicious. Warning:  I may have a slight bias here, as I love spam.  But only when spam is done right.  And here- it is done right.  Although I may try it plain next time--I had it maui style, full of coconut, pineapple and maui mustard.  I wish this place had spam musubi though.  They also have a large shave ice menu, but the shave ice machine was not impressive and looked more like one for sno-cones.  Shave ice is not a sno-cone.  So we opted to pass on the shave ice.

Absolutely delicious! Went and had the mussels w/ frites as an appetizer. I don't usually even like mussels, and I think I've fallen in love with these. I couldn't stop eating them--and the sauce, oh the sauces was amazing. Ask for some bread to soak up the sauce, you won't regret it.   I had the ribeye as an entree, and if you like your ribeye with some flavor, char, and a slight caramelization, this is the place. It was tender, juicy, and fantastically scrumptious.   Lastly, I had the hot chocolate cake. It was good, not great but good. I should have known better, I mean, its chocolate cake--nothing special.   I will be coming back Arrogant Butcher. You've stolen my heart and wallet.

My husband stopped by and bought a dozen for co-workers a year ago since we live close to here and he works in the East Valley.  It was an immediate hit!  Now it's just expected that he'll bring a dozen every week, and there is major disappointment if he doesn't.  They have very fresh and delicious doughnuts.  I knock them off a star for not fixing their menu (at the bakery and online).  They do not have muffins or cakes like their menu claims.  But doughnuts?  They know what they're doing!

Came for a HH and stayed for dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere (minus the fact that it was very warm and a little too loud), but I really like walking in and seeing the large windows and open kitchen.  It's almost like walking in to fancy barn or greenhouse with tables inside!  Tables can be put together to accommodate large crowds and the service was very good.    We ordered a pizza that had mozzarella, eggplant and garlic, and the malfadine (rock shrimp, home made pasta, delicious!) which were both very good.  Hopefully they'll fix their air conditioning issue (or maybe I'll just wait to go when it's not 118 outside!).  But I'll be back for some more fresh Italian goodness.  Note: there is no parking, and is valet only, but at least its complimentary!

Mmmmm...creamed corn.  Creamy, sweet, deliciousness.  Moist Brisket.  Smoky, peppery, juicy, so good.  I absolutely adore Rudy's.  We were first introduced to Rudy's in Austin, Texas, and this location does not disappoint.  There is free bread and a pickle station. Everything is sold in either 1/2 lb or lb fashion.  The sides are small, pint or quart.  If you've never been, you gotta jump in your car and make your way to the big red barn and get your grub on.  Most everything on the menu is great, but all I need is the moist brisket (if you are trying to save on some calories, go for the lean...but I say save up your daily calories for just one meal and go moist), and a bucket of creamed corn and I'm in heaven.  Okay, maybe some sweet tea too.  If you're feeling spicy, go for the sausage, it has great flavor!  Hey, driving to Chandler beats driving to Texas.  And this brisket is driving to Texas worthy.

Tiny place, with only 8-10 tables, but service is friendly and the food is good.  Tried both the savory and sweet crepes and wasn't disappointed.  They make their crepes a little thicker then I'm usually used to, but with the sweet crepes, they roll them up and drizzle lots of nutella (if that strikes your fancy), on them and are tasty.  But I think the savory turkey crepe was my favorite.  It was flavorful, not crazy big, but satisfying and yummy.

Super tasty!!  I'm so excited that another asian place opened up in Phoenix--usually you'd see something like this in Chandler...but I'm so stoked that it's in my hood!  I tried the taro with almond pudding and sesame topping.  Mmmmm...delicious!  It's hot in Arizona, go get some SNOH!
