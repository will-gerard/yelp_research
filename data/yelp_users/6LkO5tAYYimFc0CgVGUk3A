Stopped in for a quick bowl of Pho... The service was Very Fast and the place was full, Very good, Pho . I do prefer a flat noodle, had the round rice noodle, but enjoyed  the meatball. I am a DaVang girl but this was very good...

Had the meatloaf special, was very disappointed in the portion size, it was 1 very thin slice of meatloaf that fell a part and they put it back together on the plate. Maybe 4 bites.. My friend looked at it and was thinking the same thing I was... Got to be kidding me, it was very close to close, I think they should not of served it..
