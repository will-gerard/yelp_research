This office is full of the nicest, most genuine healthcare professionals I've ever experienced. I've been going to Dr. Reidhead's office for years and they are always on time, greet you by name when you walk in and provide excellent care for my teeth (& me). I really can't sing their praises enough. Top notch all the way!

I've been going to advanced auto for several years now and they always give it to me straight and at the best price (I used to call around for quotes but now I don't even waste my time).  I feel like they treat me just as they would their sister or daughter - not like an easy target. Definitely recommended.  Bob & the team have been really great!

Great service & good food! The burgers were great - best I've had in a long time. Sweet potato fries were good but I've had better (like FEZ) but the best was the salted carmel shake.... So so so so good!

I met some friends for breakfast here today and left under enthused. I thought going in that it was affiliated with the breakfast club in downtown scottsdale but now that I've left I'm thinking not.  I'm still not sure either way. I got the Bird omelette - over cooked and under flavored in a big way. Coffee was good but  the creamer was so old it curdled my friend's coffee. Service wasn't great. Definitely not a destination breakfast spot. I'd only go again if I was nearby and not in the mood for something special.

It's a two-fer!  Delicious & local!!  Definitely check this place out.  I go just about every Sunday and want to see more people in there.  They've got great coffee, breakfast sammies and awesome music. A great place to hang out and enjoy the good vibes.  Love it! Go here, now!

Looks like this place is going down hill since the change in ownership.  The little store was out of stock on a lot of stuff, soda machine was broken and dirty towels on the counter. They rang me up for the wrong service and were just unfriendly, not rude but not nice either. I'll be driving the extra miles to find a true Danny's.

So good! The tamarind and mint chutneys that came with the appetizer were delicious, full of flavor. Our garlic naan wasn't greasy and was perfectly balanced as to not overpower our food. I had the chicken vindaloo, which I will gladly eat again. My boyfriend had the chicken saag, also delicious, smooth and creamy.   The service was great too. We sat next to what seemed like a difficult table and the server/owner handled them with such grace offering suggestions and detailed explanations. He even looked at another restaurant's menu that the customer pulled up to show her what would be similar on his menu. He was very friendly to us as well. I wish them much success and will definitely be back.
