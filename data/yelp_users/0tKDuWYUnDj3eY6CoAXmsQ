First, this is my favorites Sub Factory location. It's the only one with the seafood sub. As a whole I'm not a huge fan of the chain, the food is low quality, bland, and unoriginal.

I discovered  Spinato's over two years ago when I lived Phoenix and I've always loved the food. About six months ago I moved to Mesa and began ordering from the Tempe location. The quality of food is just as good as any location but they don't seem to care, what so ever, about customer satisfaction. I've asked them a few times now to customize my order and they always refuse. I could understand if I asked for something complex but it's only ever been small things. Like the last time I went, I asked for one of their sandwiches made with garlic bread. Pretending they don't have prepared garlic bread standing by, it's not hard to melt butter on bread and then sprinkle garlic on it! I e-mailed the manager to complain but he never responded, making it clear to me that customer satisfaction is just not important to them. Personally I'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business.

Great fresh food at a fair price is hard to say no to. I had the ravioli and chocolate cake. The ravioli and marinara was fresh, not over seasoned, made in house and hands down the best I've ever had. Same with cake, fresh, homemade, and rich. Only issue I have is the wine list, but not really an issue sense it's not a high end place. I'll be going back here soon.
