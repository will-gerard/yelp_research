Been here before and was mildly pleased with their food. Today, I was seated in a booth. As soon as I made my first plate, I sat down to eat, and along came this dime sized German cockroach!!! I immediately called the waitress over and she moved me to another booth. If she said sorry, I probably missed it. In fact, I decided to get up and leave halfway thru my first plate. Adding insult to injury, she already had my bill ready as I got up to leave. Yes, they still made me pay full price to eat in their cockroach infested dining area! Big FAT BOOOOO on Fuji Buffet! I hope Dept of Health sees this and pops you with an inspection!

Hmmm... what would life be without Lee Lee's? Thank God you carry lots of Aloha Shoyu & Hawaiian products! The meat section is top notch; produce is not too shabby, either!  Only thing wrong is I noticed you haven't reordered any Hawaiian Sun frozen concentrate...specifically, the Lilikoi flavor! Oh, and you should look into carrying Hawaii's favorite beer...Primo Island Lager. Find it on http://www.primobeer.com . Shoots den! Aloha!

This sushi bar is small & cozy, modern, buzzing, and sheik and at 7pm, it was crowded but seating was available for my very hungry party of 5 in just 10 mins. time! Impressive response time from the wait staff! They seat us and the waitress came right over. She was very attentive and helpful with our choices. We ordered garlic edamame for appetizers - it was on. Wifey's Hibiscus Lemonade was the bomb...and so was my sake bomb! The nigiri tako sushi was tasty, perfectly chilled, and fresh! Tuna sashimi was deep red and had the perfect cut & texture - pretty fresh for the desert! LOL! The Surf & Turf Roll was so ono-licious! Seared Filet Mignon, shrimp tempura, asparagus, avocado, and sweet soy topped with fried shallots - a must try - cuz i will again! The kids had a decent menu - a California roll meal, and some teri-chicken plates. Sorry, (808 ppl) no mac salad. DOH! But they hooked my 2 young ladies up with hot fudge vanilla ice cream sundaes afterwards. Oh, and then my son and wife had some strawberry ice cream mochis! Our waitress turned out to be the owner's sister, Abby! Thanks Abby! Awesome dinner! We'll be back for sure!!

Been eating here since it converted from the old buffet. I was totally convinced that I had found the best Chinese restaurant in the area. The food was really tasty and I had been treated well by the wait staff and owner. That all changed yesterday. I had lunch here for the last time. When I walked in, the manager sat me...I was 1 of 2 customer's in the joint. I ordered and waited for my food. Customer #3 walks in and is seated right behind me. He orders his meal without rice - extra veggies. Waitress responds like he's weird, "You don't want rice?" The waitress goes to the owner and they speak for awhile. He comes back with her and they ask the customer to explain his order. "I don't eat rice. I just want fish & black bean sauce, but put extra vegetables, please." Easy enough to understand, but they go on to question why he don't like rice! PLEASE! The man don't eat rice...cook him some food! Owner says, "OK, but that will be extra..." FOR WHAT?!! I blow that off, smh and mind my business, eat my meal and my waiter asks if I want more ice tea. I said, "Sure, thanks. But can I get it in a to-go cup?" He goes back to the owner and then sends the waitress back to explain that today its cool but I would have to buy my FREE refill next time! FOR WHAT?!! SHEEESH! Really? I understand times are hard, and saving money is pretty important. However, seeing that the joint was SO NOT CROWDED, wouldn't it be wise to treat your loyal customers (if not all of them) with some hospitality & grace? Good Luck Mr. South China owner...keep doing business this way and I promise YOUR BUSINESS WILL TANK! NO SOUP FOR YOU!

We ordered 2 yakisobas and 2 sushi rolls. The yakisobas made it out in about 10 minutes. The rolls took a lot longer. About half an hour after the kids were into their yakisobas I asked one of the hostesses for my waitress. The hostess said she was busy taking another customer's order. Ok, thank you. She checked on our rolls for us and came back to say the sushi counter was backed up. Really? We've been sitting for almost 45 minutes and no sushi rolls were coming to our table! There was about 30% restaurant capacity - not a busy night. So, after she left me stewing about the lack of urgency to address the situation, I walked up to the front and asked for a manager. Sorry, sir, there's no manager on duty! WHAT?!! The hostess, who was at least somewhat attentive and concerned offered to discount our rolls 15%. Just the rolls? What about blowing the entire experience for your customer, and causing me to lose my appetite? And to fan the flames of my discontent even higher, the couple next to us who showed up and ordered after us get their rolls & meals with no issues! By the time our rolls came to the table, the couple next to us were cashed out and leaving the restaurant!!! I used to be a fan... No more. A 15% discount on my rolls won't bring me back! Poor customer service and the negligence of staff & management are going to seriously tarnish your reputation as a place of business! I hope the manager and owner of this establishment pays closer attention to reviews like this because when the paid staff fails to deliver, it is usually a direct reflection of a poorly managed business. A negligent business does NOT deserve to be in business. Don't eat here...go around the complex to Koi Sushi instead!
