I came here due to my poor experience at Comfort Inn Suites down the street. It was a much better experience. The room was clean, nice, and comfortable, the staff was friendly, they had great amenities including a coffee shop. Didn't eat here so I can't say anything about that.

I recently visited this place after going to a DBacks game with some of my friends. At first, I was reminded of the Hard Rock Cafe in Florida, but eventually I began to notice some similarities between Alice Cooper and my grandmother, because Alice Cooper'stown is much like that of an eccentric old woman's, it is cluttered from years of hoarding petty and useless things. The only difference is that instead of having numerous pictures of family and cats covering the walls, there are numerous pictures of Alice Cooper doing Alex Cooper things, like pretending a guitar is a baseball bat and scowling at a camera like a rebellious teenager while dressed as Baron Samedi.   However, despite the similarities to grandma's house, this is the go to bar when it comes to celebrating a D-Backs win. While many Phonecians get a lot of flack for their lack of support of the team, you wouldn't know it if you visited this place after a game. I am not normally a big fan of places like these, mainly due to the noise, which is mainly due to the fact that when I go out to eat, I tend to try to enjoy the food and the atmosphere, and have a conversation with a friend, however, for the purposes of going to a bar to celebrate with others, this was perfect.   Why the 4 stars then? It was way too gimmicky for food that wasn't special as a whole or for the price. For instance, they have a Mike  Myers Yeah Baby which is a disgusting sandwich with cheap cuts of meat for 17 dollars, and a Magic Johnson mushroom and swiss burger for 11 dollars. I had the big unit burger and the mac and cheese, both of which were above average for their taste, but were exorbitantly high priced. I could have gotten 3 hot dogs at the stadium for the price of the big unit alone!   Overall though, this place is worth a visit for the fun and novelty of doing so. I had a lot of fun here. Despite the place reminding me of my grandma's house.

Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss.

I came here because it was free for me. I have always liked Comfort Suites. However this location isn't too good. First, the road leading to it is horrible. It doesn't help that the signage is poor as well. It's so inconspicuous, it can easily be missed, and we did.   The room itself was clean, and had the usual assortment of items here. The TV was pretty good, and there was cable television, which was pretty good. However the bed was very uncomfortable and I could not sleep at all. Furthermore, the room got very bright, and even when the shades were pulled down it was bright enough to be distracting.  Finally, the breakfast was just not very good. The eggs were dry, the fruit was overripe or old, and the bacon was disgusting. Their pastries were also slimy. I was expecting at least a halfway decent breakfast, but this was not it.   On the positive side, the snacks were not overpriced as they are at many other hotels. Also the staff was great. Very friendly. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this place for any reason and I will not be coming back again.

I have found this airline to be very inconsistent have had overwhelmingly positive and negative experiences, but I must say that they have been more positive. I have flown US Airways out of Phoenix quite a bit over the past three years. I suppose it's unfair to review this airline as a whole because its a huge company and it's located throughout the country and similar to major chain businesses there are likely regional differences everywhere.  Also, as of this writing US Airways is becoming American Airlines by October 2015, so this is essentially a review of American Airlines as well.   The good  I think the flight attendants for this airline has been consistently good. For the most part, they have been professional, helpful, and quick to deal with problems. I tend to enjoy traveling and flying and be a lot calmer and less grumpy and antisocial compared to other passengers in my experience. I have willingly given up my seat or helped people pay for their snacks with my credit card. This has always resulted in my receiving preferential treatment including free snacks and meals myself. I never ask for it, but they always have provided them for me. Its pretty interesting, how my experiences with the flight attendants has been different compared to my fellow reviewers.  Another positive thing about the airline is that they have pretty serviceable planes and pretty decent selections of snacks on them. I was also impressed to find that on a  2 and 1/2 hour flight, they served two beverages, which rarely happens.   Another positive aspect of US Airways has been the customer service desks who prints your boarding passes. I have found them to be professional, helpful, and understanding of tech fails.  Finally, their information staff are also very helpful. I ended up missing a connection in Charlotte and Dallas due to a delay, and the staff people here were more than helpful in phoning in to the hotel vendors nearby. I thought they were great.   The bad  The customer service staff at the airports are inconsistent. While I get along with many of them, I have encountered more than one who were rude to me. For instance, I had priority seating once and since I am hearing impaired, I cannot hear the announcements over the speaker at all, and I normally have to guess when I am called. I ended up boarding too early and the staff person was rude to me and questioned my issue, when I told her about it. I have tried to talk to staff before boarding when they are there, but they never really do anything about it. I still have to guess when I am boarding.   Another mixed experience is the customer service desk for travelers who miss a connection. This has only happened to me once, and of course, I am sure that in most cases, US Airways doesn't control the issue. However I felt that my last experience was negative because the CSR agents seemed to be talking and gossiping to their coworkers rather than focusing on the customers. This would not normally be an issue, except the agent mistakenly only printed me tickets to Phoenix rather than including one to Flagstaff. Also the line to get a replacement boarding pass was long.    Overall I think this airline is above average, and I think one could do worse than flying here. Of course, things could change and this review would be rendered meaningless, but I think at the moment it is pretty good.

I recently traveled through Charlotte and although I don't normally eat fried food, I decided to try this place out because I had heard of it before and never tried it. I got a chicken tender plate with cajun fries and it came with a biscuit.   The Food  The chicken was ok, it wasn't stellar, and I thought the fried coating was overdone. I could not taste the chicken, only the batter which tasted good, but it was overpowering. The fries were ok, they are not my favorite type, but the seasoning wasn't overpowering and I could taste potato which was good. The biscuit was soggy and burnt around the sides. I did not enjoy it much, but I could tell that the flavor was good, and maybe if I went to another place, I would like it better. They also have a selection of pepsi products to drink as soda. I opted for a Mountain Dew, since I needed to stay awake. It was a bit costly to eat, at 9 dollars, so I wasn't impressed with this place at all.  The Service and Decor  The decor is typical airport. It's cramped, crowded, there is seating nearby that is usually filled during the rush, so its hard to find a spot. Typical airport problems. The customer service was ok. Nothing special. The woman who took my order was sitting on a countertop and sounded like she was on painkillers, so she may have had an injury or something like that. I'm not sure what was going on, but it was definitely different from what I have experienced in the past. She was polite at any rate and sped people through quickly.   Overall, I think my experience here was pretty bad, and I probably wouldn't go to Bojangle's at the airport again. I will however try it out again because I have a feeling that the restaurants outside of the airport will probably be a better experience.

I haven't had an awesome experience with the Delta employees in Phoenix, but I never really had a truly awful one either. Let me say this, I find the policies at the Phoenix location to be a bit frustrating and when it came time to check my bags and other things, I found it to be a cumbersome process. I am hearing impaired, so detailed and appropriate signage is always very helpful to me, but I guess that instead of having good signage, Delta prefers to have a person police the area and direct customers. Not a bad deal, since being hands off customer service wise seems to be the norm for large companies.   However, in the middle of a crowd of people it becomes difficult for me to hear others, and I don't appreciate the stress that comes from having to struggle to understand a woman who speaks so softly that I have to go through the indignity of her using some primitive sign language she made up on the spot to communicate with me. I don't think it's her fault really, but more of the fault of fault of poor planning and signage.

I came here for the express breakfast prior to a flight to Atlanta. It was pretty underwhelming. There were a few patrons here and there, so I can't speak about crowds, but I was craving breakfast and got the Huevos with bacon and potatoes, and it was served with a couple of flour tortillas on the side instead of bread. Huevos is spanish for eggs just so you all know.   The meal was adequate. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't too good either. The best part of the meal was the eggs, which were fluffy and buttery. They were delicious. Everything else was horrible. The bacon barely tasted like bacon. It was more like crispy salt sticks. The potatoes, which are hard to screw up, in fact were tasteless as well as soggy and mushy, and the tortilla, well it was hard, dry, and stale. In fact, that four tortilla was the most disgusting tortilla I had ever eaten in the 10 years I lived in AZ, and I had been around college kids who had no inkling on how to cook who knew how to properly heat up a tortilla.  However I must say that the customer service was great, and the food arrived in a timely fashion. So if you are craving breakfast and want fast service and good customer service, but do not care about the quality of the breakfast food, then look no further than this place. I will not be coming here again myself, at least for breakfast.

I came here while waiting for a flight to Charlotte NC. I have to say that while I found the place to be overpriced as usual which isn't a big surprise, my overall experience there was dismal. It could be because there was nobody there. And I mean it. When I went up to make my order, there was nobody paying attention despite there being activity in the back, so after a couple of minutes of pacing to and fro, finally I called out to them, and someone came up. I was also there during their posted business hours so that was no excuse.   The rest of the experience went as expected. The woman who helped me was polite and apologized for the delay. The food was made to order and although it took a little longer than expected since they may have needed to warm up the heaters, it was ready pretty quickly. I ordered a cheeseburger and a baked potato, however the burger was overcooked, and the cheese was placed on top a bit sloppily. Finally I asked for sour cream and chives for my baked potato and they didn't provide me with them either. Kind of strange since it was the woman who asked me if I wanted it.   Overall, I was just not impressed with this place. They need to do a better job managing it.

If you are looking for an authentic restaurant that serves NY/NJ style pizza in Charlotte, you do not need to look any further than this place. This place charges 2.50 for a huge slice of cheese or pepperoni pizza (35 cents for other toppings) and just cannot be beat for the price. In addition to that, I ordered a side of their meatballs as well. The meatballs and the sauce were excellent, and the best I have had at a restaurant in quite a while.   The slices came out piping hot, and although they were a little greasy for my taste (another sign of authenticity), that did not matter since I was able to blot it out, and enjoy both slices anyway.       The customer service here was great, and the decor was fine with some very comfortable furniture. I came here just after a blackout hit the area, and they were still open and accepting customers (although you had to pay cash to order something).   All that being said, while the pizza wasn't entirely my favorite, this place more than makes up for it with its great prices, great service, and best of all, great meatballs! I would definitely come here again if I was in the mood for a cheap and quick bite to eat.

I came here on a trip to Charlotte. I ordered a hot dog as well as the shake of the month, which was pumpkin pie. The hot dog was ok, it was not overly cheap tasting like many other places are. It was definitely tasty enough to choose not have a few toppings on it. Very nice. The shake on the other hand, was amazing. Probably the best pumpkin shake I ever had.   In addition to the good food. The service was also fantastic. The woman who rang me up took her time to make suggestions of the best items to get, and she was right on each count. In addition to that, she also had a lot to say about the great spots in the area.   Great place, well priced food, and delicious shakes. I would definitely hit up this place for lunch if you are near one.

This is a new place, and I haven't seen it before. I believe it used to be a chain restaurant, but it's possible I may have missed this place in the past. However, believe it or not this is quite possibly the best overall dining experience I have had at any airport.   Cost  I purchased the special, 2 special slices an a drink for just under 8 dollars. To tell you the truth, as far as airport food goes, this is a steal, because nearby you can buy a chicken salad sandwich for 12 dollars nearby.   Food Quality   The food quality here was pretty good, and better than average compared to most places. I ordered a white pizza and a BBQ chicken. Both were above average in quality. In particular, I enjoyed the white pizza with spinach because it had just the right amount of garlic and cheese. The crust also was very nice. It wasn't spectacular, but it was definitely better than others. they also have a selection of pepsi products to order. It wasn't a very extensive list of choices, but they had Sierra Mist so that's all that mattered to me.  Customer Service and Decor  Like any airport restaurant, this restaurant has limited seating so it gets busy during rush hour. One of my biggest pet peeves is people sitting and hanging out in the area when they don't intend to order anything, which happens frequently, but is something you can't control, and on my visit, I saw a lot of this because it was in the middle of a rush.   As for the customer service, it was ahem...serviceable. they were in the middle of a rush and needed to get people in and out quickly, and I thought they did very well.   For airport food, I found this place to be extremely impressive. Not only was the food cheap, but it was of decent quality, and I would definitely consider coming back here in the future.

This pizza is pretty good. While this is located in an airport and thus has airport prices, I have been enjoying my pizza. I have never been to a Humble Pie restaurant so I can't compare it to that. However here is my review of the food.   I purchased a 12 inch marguerita pizza and a 20 oz soda for 13 bucks, which is higher than normal but not a bad price for airport food. The pizza itself is decent. Not as great as CPK but decent and much better than the stuff you get from the large chains like Pizza Hut in my opinion. The crust is standard fare. It has flavor on it. The sauce on the other hand is a bit too herby and bitter for me. The cheese however is very good and tasted fresh. My only problem with the cheese is that it was not distributed evenly to the crust. It seemed as if someone just plopped cheese in the middle of the pie and hoped for the best. As far as service goes, the pizza arrived quickly despite there being a long line. The customer service was also good because the person who made my pizza cooked it too long and asked me if I wanted him to make a new one.   All things considered I would consider visiting this restaurant on your next layover. While I probably wouldn't go to this place outside of the airport. I must say I am impressed with this place for what it is. Normally I would give it 3 stars for the food alone if that's your deal.

I would say that Terminal 4 is probably the best terminal at Sky Harbor Airport and one of the better ones I have visited at the very least. According to the website, they serve the following airlines.  Air Canada American Airlines British Airways Southwest Airlines US Airways Volaris WestJet  I recently flew US Airways from Phoenix to and from Charlotte and was impressed by the variety of restaurants and services offered. Like any airport terminal, the space is cramped, and there is a tendency for it to get really crowded. Not to mention, the fact that some people might have long layovers and/or experience a weather delay that keeps them there for hours. However, it seems as if the staff here thought outside the box to create an experience that is different from the rest.  The most notable thing about this terminal is that there is a fitness trail near the security gate. While I didn't get a chance to go on the trail, I was impressed by the fact that it was there.   Next there is also a small museum that shows off work from local artists that capture the flavor of Phoenix and Arizona in general. Some might find it useless, but I think its a nice option for visitors, especially if you have a long layover to another destination.  As far as food and amenities go, there are several charging stations for people to charge their electronic devices, medical stations, gift shops, and several restaurants. I didn't get a chance to visit them all, but the list provided online really speaks towards the variety of options. Here are the options according to their website:  La Madeleine (open 24/7) - Gate B20 Paradise Bakery (open 24/7) - Gate C17 Wildflower Bread Company (open 24/7) - Gate A9 Blanco T & T Barrio Café Chelsea's Kitchen Cheuvront Restaurant & Wine Bar Cowboy Ciao Four Peaks Brewery Humble Pie La Grande Orange Matt's Big Breakfast Olive & Ivy Sauce  On top of the variety of restaurants and services, the customer service there is top notch. I had an issue with an earlier flight, and the representative cleared that right up and did it promptly and professionally. No issues there.   My only wish is that it would have been a better experience when it becomes crowded. I came in during a rush, and was not able to sit down and enjoy my meal. I also feel that it is very poor in regards to accessibility and that the announcements would be put on an LED display or something similar. I have a lot of trouble hearing the people on the loudspeaker, especially when there is a change in the departure gate. Thankfully, this rarely happens, but when it does, its frustrating.   In all, I think this is a good terminal. I would venture to say this would appeal to airport nuts like me, who enjoy traveling. But if you were to fly any of the airlines listed above, you could probably do a whole lot worse than make a connecting flight through Phoenix.
