Giving this one star is being nice. Absolutely dreadful food and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. At one point we had to get up and walk across the restaurant to get our watiress's attention just to refill our water glass. When we finally did get our food, it was bland and uninspired. Started with the wings, they were overcooked and too chewy. They only gave us one little cup of ranch for 8 wings and when we asked for more they said they had to charge us. I got the burger and it was ok but I have had much better at even fast food restaurants. My girlfriend got some salad that was dry, so to cover that up they drenched it in dressing. It was inedible, we sent it back. The best part about that is they still tried to charge us for it on the bill. We had to argue for about 20 min to get it off. First with the waitress, then the asst manager, and finally the general manager. Was charging us $11 for a salad we had two bites of really worth ruining a customer's experience? I guess to this establishment it is. The main reason we went was to watch a game and I was so turned off with them trying to nickel and dime us, I left in the third quarter and went to the zipp's up the street. Good setup with the tvs, but factoring in the below average food and the some of the most horrendous service I have ever experienced make Fox Sports Grill a place I wouldnt recommend to my own worst enemy.

Nice grounds. Ok room. Internet went down.  Maid never came to room at a normal hour. We would be back from the pool or golf or other day activity around 6 pm and getting ready for the evening, and would get a knock on the door and them attempting to clean the room. I have never stayed at a resort where the maids come past 3-4, let alone that late. Our room got cleaned once in 4 days. Terrible customer service. So hard to get ahold of anyone while staying here. Left countless messages that went unreturned. Set up cabana at pool and let concierge know I would have guests weeks in advance via email. Day of they told me I had a limit. Almost Ruined birthday party. Pretty much Ruined our stay as it pissed me off beyond comprehension. I was forced to talk to multiple different managers delaying start of festivities. Finally I had to pay for another room that I didn't need to get everyone in. All could have been solved with  clear communication from beginning on their part. Food sucks on top of that. Too many good options in this area to deal with the garbage customer service and nickel and diming guests who plan to spend thousands here over one weekend. My experience at this hotel has soured me on the entire westin and Starwood brand. People come to resorts to relax and have fun. My stay here has been anything but due to them putting me through the ringer and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me. Avoid at all costs.

Going back...The only way I was able to gain entry for my guests I had notified the hotel about, weeks in advance was to get another room. I just wanted everyone in, so I paid the cost. I was told I could have a limit of 5 people allowed in per room when I booked the second room. When my 9th person showed up, the pool manager tried to tell me he cant let anymore in as I am only allowed 4 per room. Their own employees do not even know their policies. Whether it was the front desk person that was wrong or the manager, somebody was relaying incorrect information to their guests. As I was pleading my case and remaining calm to the pool manager, he rationale was this..."what happens if your party is taking up too many lounge chair or chaises and my paying guests have no where to sit? Or if someone in your party gets a little too rowdy or drinks too much? I then have to comp my paying guests a free dinner and $500 credit." Verbatim. I looked around, it was about 2 pm and there were plenty of available chairs. I pointed him to my cabana that I, a paying guest paid for and showed him the majority of my party was couples sitting on the grass playing with newborn babies. A real tough crowd I tried to bring. He said he is "just looking out for the benefits of his paying guests." He went out of his way to keep using the term, "paying guest." What does that make me? The guy who was roped into buying an extra room, on top of a cabana, and had HUNDREDS of dollars worth of services scheduled at the spa for the next day. He finally relented and let my last two guests in, though the damage was done. I was on edge and stressed out from all the hoops they made me jump through just to have a few people over that I had cleared with my concierge weeks in advance. And it gets better... As I was checking out, the desk attendant asked me how my stay was and I told him the truth, that I wasnt pleased with the way I was treated and how I was put through a ringer to get a few guests into the pool that I had already gotten pre-approval for. I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and he said no problem. He comes out from the back and says the hotel manager is in a meeting but would be happy to call me later today. I gave him my number. That was at 10:30 am. It is now almost 9 pm and i never once got a call. The best part is we had a late flight and we stayed on the grounds and ate some lunch. My concierge gave me a $75 gift certificate that I was told could be used anywhere onsite. I tried to use it to pay for a $30 lunch. The waitress came back and said it had been cancelled and there was no money on it. I am a starwood preferred member, I have a starwood AMEX and I have stayed in only starwood properties for the majority of my adult life. I will do my best to never set foot on one of their properties ever again. If it wasnt for the friends they tried so hard to keep out of their pool area and my girlfriend whose birthday we were attempting to celebrate, the weekend would have been ruined. Luckily I choose my friends better than I choose hotels I stay at.

Update on my previous complaint-The resort manager at Kierland, Brian Montalbano reached out to me. He went above and beyond to correct the issues I had and has won me back. With solid leadership like Brian, my faith has been restored in your company. However it was still annoying how late the maids tried to clean the rooms every day.
