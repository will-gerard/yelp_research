Honest and friendly staff that have superb workmanship. What more could you ask for? (Maybe a free shuttle home while your car is getting worked on or a goodie bag left as a thank you? Yep they have that too)

My friends were kind enough to throw me a surprise bday dinner here.  They definitely chose a great place. The waitress was so sweet and accommodating.  We started with the Crostino Di Prosciutto which I highly recommend and calamari which wasn't a bad choice either. I ordered the lobster risotto containing several large pieces of lobster.  It was very flavorful and filling.  My friends brought in a cake. The staff not only allowed this, but cut and plated the cake for us adding whipped cream for presentation. Talk about above and beyond!!  Every bit of this place was worth the 5 stars!

I had a fantastic experience today. Mark took care of me and my overly neglected feet and hands. My mani-pedi was only $50 which I thought was very reasonable considering I got a design on my toes and gel nails. All of the staff were kind and Mark was hilarious.  Although small, the salon was clean, and I had a great experience! Thank you!!

I have been talking about trying this place for nearly two years. I am so happy to report that my personal hype was well rewarded!    I ordered the BMOC.. Oh.. My.. Goodness.. Yumm! I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but this one was cooked to perfection. The mixtures of the sweet and savory fulfilled all of my breakfast cravings. The sweet waffle, apple-maple syrup, and Portuguese doughnut paired perfectly with my poached eggs and pork chop.   The portion for the price was incredible. I definitely could not finish my meal, and I like to eat.   I also had the Japanese cold brewed coffee which was refreshing on a warm Phoenix morning.  I was surprised how strong the coffee was. Next time I will try the flight of flavors.   I will be back!!

I didn't read any reviews prior to visiting, and I wish I would have. The venue was clean and has a rustic Patriotic/Christian theme. We were promptly seated, and the staff were all pleasant. The food was, however, nothing to write home about. I ordered the California Chicken Salad. The dressing and walnuts were great, but the salad was mainly iceberg lettuce. The chicken was rubbery and flavorless; I could not eat it. My date got the Wrangler Burger which was just ok as well. There are definitely better burgers in the valley.  As the menu is so limited, I do not believe we will be back.
