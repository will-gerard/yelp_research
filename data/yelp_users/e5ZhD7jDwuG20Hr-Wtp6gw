Not good service. Employees are disorganized and not proactive. I was waiting to pay and there was a man at the register and he was on his cell phone. On the other hand... The lady who made my smoothie was very welcoming and proactive so I thank her for the good service.

Sauce is one of my go-to restaurants. Lately my orders have been messed up and I haven't had the best experience but I always come back because I love this restaurant. I give this 4 stars because that last 2 times I've gone , they have done a really great job at getting my order correct and they're very nice!! Keep it up :)

Not pleased with the service at this location. Sat in the bar area because you can seat yourself. I was with a party of 3, waitress asked the 2 others what they wanted to drink except for me.. Later on I ordered my food " bacon and ranch quesadilla" But with no meat ( chicken or beef ) added. The server then said "so you just want a plain quesadilla then?" And I said yeah  but with bacon. She then snapped back at me and said "But you said no meat??"  I didn't appreciate it and her tone was rude ..  I didn't feel like we received great customer service. I always have some kind of issue at this restaurant. I will not be back.

I never knew my hair could look so beautiful! We went to this salon based on their reviews and it was better than expected. Brent and Joy are well trained professionals that went an extra mile to make my first visit perfect. This will always be the place for me to go and I will recommend to anyone ! I am very happy with the result of my balayage done by Brent and during the hair wash Joy is absolutely amazing with her head massage and gentle shampooing I was very impressed.  I cannot wait to go back!

I've been going to European Wax Center for years and I have to say, I look forward to going because of my wonderful waxer Brittney! She makes the experience so wonderful and she does an amazing job waxing because she is a perfectionist , No hairs left behind. :) would recommended to anyone!

Love their ice cream, the staff is nice:) I didn't put a full 5 stars only because it seems like they never mop the floors :/
