I work right around the corner from this place and it seems to be out go-to watering hole to get hammered and eat spicy food.  Not that we're picky on the getting hammered part, but the food here is damn good.  I'm not really a cajun food person to begin with, but there a few awesome things about Baby Kay's that you can't get just anywhere.    1) Seafood Burrito on Tuesday nights - holy mother of goodness...I'm not sure how much of the ocean is actually thrown in that tortilla, but it's fantastic.  There's a ton of cheese, cream sauce and I'm sure a ton of other uber-healthy ingredients.  Amazing.  If you've never been here before, you should hit up Tuesday nights.   2) Friday/Saturday Pork Chop - again, not really a pork chop person.  I wouldn't go to a restaurant and scan the menu for a pork chop...but this one is INSANE.  You don't need a knife...it's so moist (I hate that word, but I'll reserve the right to use it when talking about Baby Kay's pork chop) and juicy I really want to curl up and die a happy person after consuming half a pig.  Yum is all I can say to that visual.  Yes, they're kind of pricy, but it's not outrageous.  I've had the gumbo and the sampler platter too, all of which are delicious.  The bar is great, I notice they serve a lot of beers on tap, but they also have a full bar that I've taken advantage of multiple times.  Also - during the week they have a guy (who may or may not be  homeless, it adds to the luster) who plays jazz music inside the restaurant and it's great.  It's like Enya when you're in a massage, it really makes you feel as though you might be in Louisiana for the night.  Thankfully, you're not, b/c that place sucks.  Try it out and go on a Tuesday or Friday/Saturday night!

If I could give this place negative stars, I would.    This place sucked.  All-around.  The only positive note I have is they had the most recent US Weekly.  Let me start from the beginning...  I went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.  I walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.  So, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.  Now, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says "no credit card, use ATM in the corner."  Uh, what?  So I realize they don't take credit cards or checks.  I have to go withdrawl cash from their mother f^$*^%& ATM machine in the corner that charges me $5 (on top of whatever my bank will charge me) so I can pay for my terrible pedicure.    This place stinks...there's way too  much competition out there to charge and treat customers like this...DO NOT GO HERE.  Drive down 50 more feet for another salon.

This is one of my favorite little spas in the Valley.  I'm in love with their marketing (pink and brown color scheme), but more importantly, they do a great job on a variety of services.  I have been going there consistently for the past year for my brazilian waxes and have always walked away happy.  I've also had a massage and pedicure there, both were great. One cool thing they do for their massage is you can pick your "playlist" so if you don't want to hear the same 'ol Enya-type music, you can pick Billy Joel, Country, etc.  Super fun idea!  If you're a spa person, I'd highly recommend checking this place out.  Also, get on their e-mail list or follow them on Twitter b/c they have some great deals.  This whole summer they ran a deal for $39 Brazilian waxes...awesome deal!    Lastly - sometimes you walk into these spa places and you get a snobby vibe...at Fuschia they're always nice and friendly.

I am a big fan of a few things:  gin, men's boating shoes and mainly, pedicures.  I get pedicures probably 3x a month, I'm a junkie.    I'm a big fan of the "Asian" run nail salons, especially around this area.  However, Charlie's just plain sucked.  The place wasn't clean, the pedicure was weak, the "design" they did on my toes wasn't worth $5, and the woman doing my pedi didn't even stay in the lines, I had to come home & clean up the magenta splotches on my side toes.    One perk (sole reason for 2 stars) is that they did that razor dead skin thing (which may or may not be legal) and I think anyone willing to deal with that deserves 2 stars on Yelp.   All in all:  too much competition out there to give crappy pedicures...go down 1 block to another cheap nail place.

I've been to Geisha a few times now and I'm a huge fan. They have delicious, creative, fattening (yes, I like cream cheese in my sushi you haters), funny named, fantastic sushi rolls. One has fritos on it for god's sake...this place is all-American.   I won't go into detail on how amazing the sushi is, but it is. Lots of things to choose from and if you're not a super big sushi person, this is prob a great place to try out b/c the rolls are very mild.   My fav part of this place is their infused sake. You get an entire carafe for $8...great deal in Old Town. I've had mango, pineapple, pomegranate and apple. All were good, but mango was the best. They also have some delish cocktails that knocked me on my ass pretty quickly...highly suggest. Another perk - the waitresses are actually really nice. Skanky, yes. But extremely nice and helpful. I don't expect that from a place like this in Old Town.   Great people watching and great music plays throughout the bar/restaurant...give this place a try, you'll like!

I founs 2 Sisters Skin Spa off Doozy Deal and got a facial/lip/eyebrow wax.  Courtney, one of the owners did my facial/waxing and I have a few great things to say.   1)   Great storefront.  Cute, fun, boutiquey.  Nice way to introduce people to what you're "all about" 2) Facial was great...waxing was quick and painless.  Nice job overall on both services.  I'd go back for either or all. 3) My favorite part of this experience is that I've done a lot of facials in my time and I realized that right towards the end I start getting that uncomfortable feeling in the back of my head.  Because I know in about 10 minutes, the big sell is about to happen.  I have been given the Aveda skincare pitch at least 10 times...enough, it's annoying!  Just give me my facial and let me leave in peace!  Courtney was great b/c I told her up-front that I used all Philosophy skin-care and she told me at the end "no need to change anything, you have great skin."  Wait, what?  Did I just black out?  You're not going to sell me some $85 cranberry eggplant scrub?  Nope, nothing.  It was a beautiful moment.  I would definitely go back to 2 Sisters...very great experience!

After reading some reviews of my sweet, sweet Arcadia Tavern, I had to write to set the record straight.  If you haven't been here, go.  It's not the  most amazing bar in the world, it's not the most delicious food in the world, but it's a great, fun neighborhood bar (that's clean, open, airy, busy and non-pub'ish)...I read some reviews where people said the kids really bothered them.  I'm 27, don't have children, don't particularly like dealing with children (especially while I'm downing 15 ketel/sodas) but I can honestly say that I've never been bothered by kids at this place.  Yes, there's a corner of the restaurant that has a Wii.  Big deal.  The kids sit and play Wii and don't bother me...didn't really even register with me that this place is "kid friendly"  I usually sit at the bar or the bar area and drink their lovely fishbowl Dos Equis until I get hungry enough to order their wings or hummus platter.  I've had quite a few entrees too, including the caprese sandwich, chicken sandwich & spaghetti.  All were good.  Not great, sure, but most entrees are about $10...no big loss.    We usually start out here pre-drinking before we head to Scottsdale or some other overly-expensive bar.  Great place to go with co-workers or to watch a PAC-10/Big 10 (they have both sets of helmets at the bar)  game.

Since I only seem to review spas, restaurants and bars, figured I'd step out and try to make myself appear as a functioning member of society.  I grew up going to LA Fitness on the west side of town and I also was a member of 24 Hour Fitness in Tempe, so I'll use those as comparisons.  I also am a "gym person" so take that into account so you don't think I'm just bitching about having to work out my fat ass.  The problem with this location is I have been at pretty much every time possible and it's RIDICULOUSLY busy.  If you're into doing free weights or weight machines, I wouldn't waste my money signing up for a membership.  If you're interested in doing classes and just doing cardio (treadmills, etc.) I'd say you'd be fine and it's only $25/mo which is a great deal honestly.  I can say without a doubt that there is usually at least 2 open treadmills and a few elipticals.  However, NEVER can I seem to jump on any weight machine and the free weights area is a Scottsdale DB haven...I think there actually might be a giant magnet that attracts them there by the dozens.  They must get a discount if they wear Affliction shirts to work-out in.    One last ditty - the front desk staff are hard-core bitches.  I'm not sure why they hate their lives that much, but they're not nice.  The "trainers" they have you talk with aren't much better, but really put the hard sell on why you need to spend thousands of dollars on their service, so be prepared.  Conclusion - I cancelled my account but if you're only interested in going for classes (I only did spinning and they were decent classes) and cardio, probably worth the $25.  If you like a more well-rounded gym, go to 24 Hour Fitness for a little better quality for just a little more $ per month.

Went here for restaurant week and I'm glad I tried it out.  The ambiance is really great in here, especially cute for a first date etc.  They do have a great wine list, but all I tried was the Chardonnay on the special menu, which I wasn't overly excited about, however, it turned out to be one of the best Chardonnays I've ever had.    Order the fried pickles for an appetizer, delish and perfect and thin and crispy and wonderful...highly recommend. I had the pesto pasta for dinner (which I would never normally order) and I have to say, if I went back I'd probably order it again.  I've heard the burgers are also really good, but the pasta was amazing.  Lastly, I had the cheesecake for dessert which tasted like it was frozen, so I deduct a star for that little miscue.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and noticed they have a patio outside which i'd like to try when it gets below 100 degrees.    All around a good experience, service was fine and the hostess was very friendly (a nice plus in Old Town).

I had high hopes for this place...cute name and theme.  Plus, I looked at their menu online and was pretty excited.    What's funny is that OTHER than the food (somewhat of a big deal when I go out to eat and I'm starving!) I had a great experience here.  Service was great (really great actually), we got right in and I had one of the best gin cocktails I've had in awhile.  Delish...if anything go for a few drinks and move on somewhere else for the food.  I had trout and it was worse than something I could make at home on a Tuesday night.  Which is saying a lot b/c I'm a terrible cook.  Sides were flat, small portion and just not very satisfying.  Conclusion  - great service, great drinks and fun atmosphere but terrible food.  Lots of other great places like that in Scottsdale, don't waste your time!

Went to Stingray Sushi recently for dinner.  I've been here one other time, but I had 18 too many cocktails and couldn't taste the sushi, story of my life.    However, I was able to taste the sushi last night and was very disappointed.  I know they also own Geisha A Go Go (or Geisha owns them, whatever) and that's one of my fav Scottsdale places, so I had some big hopes for Stingray.  Here is why I gave 2 stars:  1) Choice of rolls and creativity of rolls was subpar.  I had cooler rolls where I lived in Lansing, Michigan...c'mon, this is The Biltmore, gimme something more exciting than the "Spicy Crab Roll". 2) Appetizer we had wasn't good.  We ordered the scallop and mushroom (which the waitress said was 'AMAZING, like OMG") so don't order that. 3) Wine was good...$7-10/glass...bright spot of the night.  Overall - it was just an "ok" experience...spent $72 (pre-tip) on 3 rolls, appetizer and 2 glasses of wine.  Not worth it in my opinion, much better sushi places like Blue Wasabi in Phx/Gilbert and even Hana I like better in Central Phoenix.

I first went to Salon Embellish thanks to a great Groupon (hour massage & shampoo/style for $39), and if you've used Groupon like I have, you know that is a big risk.  However, Salon Embellish was one of those gems in the world of dog Groupons.  Here's why:    1) They didn't have the typical "Groupon" attitude where they're actually annoyed by the business they're getting from all these Groupon appointments. 2) The massage I had was GREAT! Kudos to my massage therapist for actually asking me halfway through if everything was ok.  I also liked that she chose some cool music outside Sade and windpipes. 3) The owner did my shampoo/style and she was super cool/nice.  As an awesome perk, she ordered a clipless curling iron (retails for $120) and had me pay at cost...she ordered it and got it back within 3 days.  All around - great experience, I'd definitely go back!
