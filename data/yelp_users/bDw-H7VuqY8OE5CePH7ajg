Not happy with this location :( I love getting a big rig with chicken, pretty much all I ever order every-time, but this location has killed it for me. It tastes different every-time. Tonight it tastes like something I would throw together in my kitchen, seems as if they are not even following their own recipe anymore :( :( makes me super sad since this location is the closest to where I live and I've had a big rig obsession for a while. Won't be going back.

I never write reviews, but this place deserves it!! Staff was so friendly and the services were great! I will definitely go back and recommend it to others!! Their pricing is reasonable, especially with their groupons and specials :) :)
