I've been to CK a few times (just getting to inputting all my reviews) and this is one of my favorite fusion restaurants in Phoenix. The flavor profile is amazingly different and unlike any other Asian restaurant that i've been to. My favorite dishes are the Kimchi Fried Rice and Roasted Pork Belly.   The space is well designed and open and it's a great date night place if you want something different.

I was here for brunch and the food was quite amazing. The Bloody Mary cart that comes right to your table is a nice little perk! The only reason it didn't get five stars was the excessive wait time to get a table. It's not a place you can be in and out quickly.

The same great, friendly service in a more open environment but yet still has space for private engagements. The bar area is by far my favorite change in that it's no longer segregated and even has additional seating around the parameter of the bar aside from right at the bar itself. The food is still the same great quality (if not a touch better) and the drinks are just as well made. The patio area is definitely better and larger and the garage parking is a nice perk as well (especially with the Blink charging stations for those driving eco-friendly cars.)   Overall, my doubts about the new space have all been put to rest as everything about this space is better and upgraded. Fez 2.0 reboot is a winner!

I rarely write a review of a restaurant until I've tried it a few times. Let's face it, we all have bad days.   I've dined at Ocotillo five times now at all different days/times of the week and there has been a consistent theme: Slow service. This is an all around problem from the service staff to the kitchen. On each occasion, the server had to be flagged down as the time between checking in was about 20 minutes. Two of the visits we had a party of five and six respectively and both times the food came out staggered so that one or more people in our party waited up to 10 minutes before getting their order.   As far as the food, the dishes are described with great flavor profiles but the majority of them were quite bland.   This place has potential being in a great location and having an open, versatile dining space but with the average food and below average service, they are going to lose the repeat customer base quite quickly.
