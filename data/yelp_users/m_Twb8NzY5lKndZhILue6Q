Originally I never even heard of this place. It was like a hidden gem. My Italian coworker told me about it when I told him I had trouble finding a place that can make a good cannoli. (I can make them myself but I don't want to).   We got our sandwiches to go. The sandwiches were super good. They had great quality ingredients. I would definitely return again. The only thing I didn't like about this place is the location. It seems kinda scary if I were to go alone at night. However, they close at 6pm. But inside, it's very cute. They have a bunch of stuff for sale like little signs, a great olive oil selection, a bunch of baked goods, and other imported awesomeness. If I had more money I probably would have spent like $100 on a few olive oils in there.   The workers were efficient and very nice. It was a very pleasant experience.   But back to the sandwiches: the bread was fresh and had great flavor. I'm super picky on bread. I think if a place has terrible bread, everything else can only be mediocre at best. It had a great texture, wasn't overly dense or too chewy. We wanted to try a few different sandwiches. We had the 19, which is Robert's special (our new favorite)-$7.99. It had roast beef, pastrami, provolone, tomato, mayo & onion. It was everything you want a hot sandwich to taste like that didn't have anything fried on it. I was glad they didn't put too much mayo on it. I'm generally not a fan of mayo. But all the flavors worked well together. I'd be back just based on that sandwich alone. We also tried 15, their super sub with ham, capicolla, pepperoni & I don't remember what kind of cheese-$7.99. It was good though. That one wasn't anything spectacular, but we were definitely not disappointed. We got 7, the "Italian stallion" house sub.-$6.99. It had ham, capicolla, genoa salami, pepperoni & provolone. I liked this one a lot too. It had a great combination of flavors. I would recommend this one as well. The last sandwich we brought home was 18, George's special-$7.99. It had ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (a pink Italian sausage made of finely ground pork, & smooth textured) , pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers. They asked if we wanted mild or hot peppers. We of course, wanted hot peppers. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it also was pretty awesome. Everything worked well together in the sandwich. I loved the slight crunch from the hot peppers as well as that extra "zing" it adds.   And the whole reason that we went there, the cannoli-$2.99. I only bought one and I wish I bought more. I'm kind of glad I didn't though because I probably could have eaten a bunch. It had a good texture for the cannoli shell. It wasn't soggy or rock hard. The filling was great. It wasn't overly sweet. It didn't have raisins, so I was really glad about that. It probably could have used a little bit more mascarpone in the filling, but it was still extremely delicious and a really great treat. I will buy more of these when I'm back too. I can't wait to try the other yummy looking treats as well.

I love the sandwiches here. You can get double meat if you like for only like an extra $1. I wish there was one located closer to my house. Every single time I'm here, I always buy copious amounts of food so I can take some home, because it's like an hour and a half away from my house (one way).   Their baguettes are so crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sandwiches have a good crunch with the pickled veggies and a nice spice with the thinly sliced jalapeños.   The egg roll filling is a nice texture, not overly salty, and has a good mix of flavors, slightly peppered, with chicken and shrimp. My honey can eat like 10 of them. You can get 20 for $14.99, or 5 for $3.99  Their "lee's coffee" which is coffee with sweetened condensed milk is nothing less than amazing. So yummy.   Recently they started carrying macarons. Best decision ever. I tried the green tea macaron. It was perfect. The matcha was balanced perfectly in the filling and macaron, which a lot of places fail at.  Word of advice? It's cash only. Always bring cash. Their ATM was out of service this time. I had to go to Walgreens next door, and their ATM was out of service too. It wasn't a huge deal, but that was kind of annoying. The limit for cash back at Walgreens was $20, and I really wanted to buy a ton of egg rolls to bring home.

I've been here 3 times. I absolutely love it. The staff is super nice, and the food is great. I know how to make baguettes, but you can get a great baguette here without any work. I originally came to this little gem after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins & Dives. I seriously can't believe I never came here sooner. The ambiance is lovely. The only thing that would make this place better would be access to a changing table in the restroom.   I had the pig dip. It's the perfect sandwich. I get that every time. Everyone should try it. I'm seriously obsessed.

I come here infrequently, but it doesn't make it any less delicious. When I feel like treating myself I get breakfast here. I used to go eat here with my boyfriend after hiking on Thunderbird Mountain.   I've had pretty much every breakfast item, but my favorite is the ham and Brie frittata with apples. It has so much flavor, they never over salt it, and it comes with sourdough toast and rosemary home fries. The eggs are always perfectly cooked, and they don't skimp on the Brie, ham or apples. Every bite is the same amount of deliciousness. It's exactly the same every time, and I wouldn't have it any other way.   The sourdough bread has the perfect "tanginess" that one would expect with a good sourdough. It has the perfect crunchy exterior. I might add that I am extremely picky about my pastries and breads, having gone to culinary school.   The cinnamon roll was something I hadn't tried before, I picked one up for mu daughter. It was HUGE! It was great that the cinnamon roll dough was tender. Some places tend to overwork the dough, and you can tell in the finished product. The frosting isn't cloyingly sweet, and there is an okay amount of cinnamon. It was pretty good, but the only thing was, it didn't "wow" me with the overall flavor. I look for appearance, flavor, and texture. Unfortunately it was a little lackluster in the flavor department.

I just bought a sandwich here. You have to wait awhile before anyone even acknowledges you. They said they were out of focaccia, ok fine. Then I asked if they had sour dough. She said sure, then went out of the sandwich area and got a loaf of sourdough. Couldn't they have done the same for the focaccia? It was right there. My biggest concern is that she had one gloves hand and one bare hand. Now, I wouldn't care if she only used the gloved hand to make my sandwich. But she used both hands. So while she's making it, I'm debating about whether or not I still wanted it, with her touching it. I really wanted a hot sandwich, so I was like, screw it, if they heat it, it kills germs. But she briefly touched it with her bare hand again. But it was the corner....so I was like, well whatever, I don't have to eat that corner. I didn't want to ask her to throw it away, because I absolutely hate wasting food. Plus, if she was so brazenly handling my sandwich with a bare hand in front of me, who knows if everything else that was already prepped was ok? So, if I get sick, it's her fault. I'll take my chances with this one. If that lady doesn't know, I'm pretty sure it's a major health code violation, touching ready to eat food with bare hands.   The reason they got 2 stars? The guy that got me a bag of jo jo potatoes got .995 pounds when I asked for a pound. Call me nerdy, but that's pretty impressive for that kind of accuracy. (He did not touch anything with his bare hands)  Other than that, I don't have any complaints. The people are nice, but....that health code violation, it can be tricky for some people.   If you're not at home, don't touch food with bare hands. Ick.

I *LOVE* this place!  Tanya made my nails look super gorgeous. I had gel done on my natural nails, and they look so amazing! Everyone there is super nice! I'm definitely going back there. I think I have my new regular nail place.   I was a walk-in on a Thursday, I waited less than 5 minutes. Awesome.   It's in the middle of a bunch of shops, just a few stores down from another nail shop, but I've been to both and this one is better.   *Tip* they don't allow tipping on debit/credit cards, so bring some cash, otherwise there's an ATM at the gas station just a few stores down.  See the photo of my nails to see how pretty they looked!

Normally I think this place was ok. However, we got sick from the butternut squash pasta we shared. And, they got my order wrong. First they yelled to me from behind the counter asking if it was to go, when I saw them write it on the paper. Then, put steak that was supposed to go on my honey's steak sandwich, and put it on my Italian sandwich. It didn't taste bad, but they ended up giving him some turkey sandwich that he said tasted disgusting. Also, we had a buy one get one free coupon for the "you pick 2" things, which we got 2 of them, but then they said we couldn't use the coupon. Irritating, but whatever. (And no the coupon wasn't expired) Since the food was to go, I didn't know the sandwiches were wrong until we got home. I'm not going to hold up a line and unwrap my sandwiches to look at them. I'm pretty sure they were counting on that. Would I ever return? Probably not to that location. I'll probably go to the 67th ave & 101 location. That place has never gotten me sick or screwed up my order.

This is one of the few places I will buy cake. Most places it's either dry, or cloyingly sweet to compensate for not having quality ingredients, hoping you won't notice.   The workers are always super friendly. I ordered a birthday cake here and couldn't have been more pleased. I would highly recommend ordering cakes here. It was ready when I needed it, and super delicious.   They have punch cards for purchases of their adorable bundlets and bundtinis.   My favorite has to be red velvet. It's literally my favorite red velvet cake anywhere that I've purchased one. It's not overly sweet, you can taste the cocoa flavor, and they put chocolate chips in it. Amazeballs. Plus their cream cheese icing is great. It has the tanginess that you expect in it, great smooth texture, just the right amount of vanilla and sugar.   My next favorite is the white chocolate raspberry. It has a really great quality raspberry purée swirled into a white chocolate batter. The sweetness of this cake is pretty intense, but it's still really good.   The lemon is nice. It's a great lemon cake with their usual cream cheese frosting. You get the brightness of the lemon flavor with just enough sugar. Super good.   Their carrot cake is just ok. I wasn't impressed by it. However, my mom loved it. I just thought the flavor wasn't as impressive as the aforementioned other 3. My mom thought it was perfect for her. Aside from the red velvet, this is her favorite.   Plus if you sign up in their email list, you get to know when they have new/seasonal flavors, and on your birthday, they send you an email for a free bundlet. And now your birthday can be even better.

The area the place is in seems a bit sketchy. Do NOT get the "fresh rolls". They are disgusting. It's crappy salad mix with cilantro and mint and shrimp in a rice paper roll. It's literally the worst "roll" I've ever eaten in my life.   Service was good though. It seems like a little family owned place.   The shrimp pad Thai was super good. It wasn't too dry or overly saucy. We had it at spice level "2" which had a great kick to it. I love spicy food, and it gave me the sniffles from the spice. But it was really good and I would definitely eat here again. I gave them 4 stars bc service was good and I loved the pad Thai. Loved it. Just don't get the "fresh roll".
