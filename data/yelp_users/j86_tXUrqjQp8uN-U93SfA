Our cat Callahan had a seizure while we were out of town. Our pet sitter brought him here and we couldn't be happier with the quality of care and compassion we received.  They work as a team and everyone is involved in getting our pet well. The facility is spotless and state of the art. Dr Lunt, the director, was the one who first cared for Callahan.  He is knowledge but also humble enough to reach out to colleagues for additional opinions. If there is a bright side to this heartbreaking situation for our cat it is that we found this amazing group of caregivers.  Thanks to them our boy is still with us.

Dr.Jarvis is knowledgeable, compassionate and kind. Her team is first rate, welcoming and accommodating. We trust her with our large family of rescues and highly recommend her. She is genuine and guides us well through our decisions about our pets' care.

We have been going to this location on and off for quite awhile. We have been frustrated at the inconsistency of the kitchen but we enjoy the some of the staff so we eventually forgive and go back for another try. Last night we left absolutely dumbfounded...I ordered a cocktail that is only made correctly by one person on the wait staff. I usually only order it when she is there. Last night I took a chance on the bartender and ordered it anyway.  When my drink arrived it was pink and is supposed to be clear! I asked the server if she was sure she ordered the right drink and she replied, "The bartender said it might appear a little pink. That's just because there was probably still some of the previous drink he made in the cocktail shaker. It should be fine". Then she asked me if I wanted them to make it again! I was speechless!
