I have literally been coming here for wings for the past 14 years. Yes even when I was younger. It's the only place I will go for wings.  Growing up I always loved going to Chicago's. My dad would take my sisters and I just for some wings. They still have the same baseball pinball machine which is always fun to play when waiting for your food.  As I got older, I didn't get as often until I got to high school. From there on, I always brought friends with me to Chicago's to try it out.  I've been going often enough that some of the workers there know what I'll order. I have the same order of hot wings, extra ranch w/cheese fries and a large Pepsi.  I haven't yet to expand on different food items, I've only had sliders, wings, cheese fries, shakes and hot dogs. The food is good and it's such a unique place.

I planned a birthday happy hour lunch with friends and decided why not Ra for their decent happy hour.  I should have known better than to go to Ra even after reading the Yelp reviews, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Service for drinks were pretty good but for food, below average.  Majority of my friends all received their food in a decent time span except myself the birthday girl and a friend.  His sushi took over 45 minutes even when others at the same table ordered the exact same item. The waitress did admit to forgetting his order which her honesty was appreciated. There was one roll I never received and just told the waitress not to bring it. The sushi was overall good at a decent price along with the drinks. Service not so much especially when there is no sense of urgency to having food brought to a customer. The last thing I want to see with a hungry stomach is wait staff just hanging around the restaurant.  I'm hoping I caught a bad day and maybe I'll Ra out again in the future. Till then, spend your thirsty dollars elsewhere.

I just had dinner at Switch, introducing my boyfriend to the place. I've been here multiple times but this time it's worth writing home to mom about :)  My boyfriend and I shared the lobster & crab puffs and the apricot bbq chicken skewers.  He loved the lobster & crab puffs, which are my favorite. The spicy sauce that comes along with it, I can't have enough of on the puffs, very nice.  The little cucumber salad that comes along with the chicken skewers compliments the chicken very well.  I always get my favorite, the sangria salad. The dressing is amazing! And maybe it's just me, but they put right amount of goat cheese in the salad. My boyfriend had the Eastport lobster roll and he said it's best he had in a while. The service was good. The server was attentive from far away, he didn't come up to our table to check up on us but knew when we needed refills on our drinks and to clear plates.  The only thing I don't understand is the music. If it was a busy Friday and Saturday night I'd understand the dance music but Sunday night?  I'm not much of a breakfast person, but Switch makes me want to try their brunch special.

My last encounter with Switch was not a very pleasant. I decided to go in for lunch but it didn't happen. Our server forgot about our table for 10 minutes, so we left.  I did take-out for a while, sticking to the Sangria salad and lobster crab puffs.  I finally decided to dine in again last night, taking two of my sisters with me to celebrate a birthday.  We were seated quickly by a gentleman who ended up being our server. He read our table pretty well, letting us talk and checking up every once in a while.  The food as always is amazing. My sisters were very satisfied with the Eastport Roll and the burchetta. I had the lobster & crab puffs, it's hard to say no especially with the sauce that goes with it.  Our server, Robert I believe, when mentioning dessert we asked if they had cheesecake. They had something better that I cannot remember what it was.  Robert made our night enjoyable and will definitely be going back soon.

Last time I was at Moira's I didn't remember. But I was just there recently. My girlfriend and I decided to go somewhere different other than the usual places we go to. So worth it! Their happy hour is pretty awesome and I got more than I was able to eat. I loved the squid salad, probably my favorite. Next time I should read up on the different types of sushi so I can try new things!

A friend of mine and I decided to have dinner at Blue Hound Sunday night. We figured it would be steady but slow enough to enjoy dinner.  The decor itself is amazing! Very well decorated and unique, from the lighting fixtures to the coffee tables.  The food of course, was the best part of the night. Sergio was our server, and was able to help us by explaining the drink menu and the dinner menu. He made great suggestions for both, noting that for the dinner menu, it was more tapas and family style which works best for me. Sergio was also very attentive through out the night.  The Summer of Shandies cocktail was very yummy that I might just try to replicate it at home. We tried a number of dinner items, all which were full of different but great flavors. My favorites though, were the tomato heirloom salad, zucchini corn dogs,and  the short rib. For dessert, I would recommend the cake n shake. the cake part is definitely sharable but the shake, too good to share :)  Both managers that were on the floor, Cheyenne and Matt, even stopped by to check how our evening was going.  For the quality and the attention to detail that is spent to create the variety of cocktails and food, the value is definitely justified.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful the service was and how delicious the food tasted. I will definitely be back for dinner and to try out Lustre the pool bar!
