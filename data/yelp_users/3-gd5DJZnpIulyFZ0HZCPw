I went to BF a while back & thought the food was just OK. The way my friend & I were treated when we showed up a few minutes before our reservation was a true slap in the face. They were completely rude & told us to wait in the hallway near the bathrooms until our table was ready. What was interesting is that there were only a few patrons in the restaurant. I'm a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list.  I don't care how good your food is but if the service is bad, I will never return.  There are too many great restraunts in the Phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like Bread Fruit.

Great service from start to finish!!!  Everyone involved brought their A game. We ordered four sliding glass doors for our 1970's home in North Central Phoenix. The quality of the doors and insulation was beyond our expectations.  Our home is so quiet now. We can't wait to realize the energy savings this summer.   Thank you K&J Windows!!! You definitely earned a referral.

Horrible Horrible Horrible!  The worst dining experience in a very long time.  Waited over an hour and a half and still had not received our full order.  We finally got fed up and paid for what we ate and left.  Food was ok!  If it wasn't for tourism in Scottsdale this place would be shut down already.  In my line of business I recommend a lot of local dining establishments and this will never make the list.  I will be sure to remind folks to avoid it at all cost.  Shame Shame Shame!

This is brand new restaurant in the master plan of Vistancia in Peoria,  AZ and is touted as mexican comfort food.  Today was my first visit to the Blu Agave and WOW! I was very impressed.  I had the Grilled Chicken Torta and it was yummy :).  Great mix of flavors and the bun was super fresh and super delish.  For dessert my collegues and I tried the Tres Leches Creme Brulee and it was also incredible.  Looking forward to my next visit and plan on bringing a group of my foodie friends.  Thanks Blu Agave!!

The worst OktoberFest I've ever been to.  40 minutes for a beer and over an hour for a less than mediocre Brat and pretzel.  The pretzel was in the garbage in 2 second.  Shame on the Arizona Center for Germanic Culture on poor planning and execution!!!!  Never again............

Jake and his team always do a great job!  We have had lots of work done by Desert Valley Concepts and the works is always top notch.  Our close friends had their entire kitchen remodeled by Desert Valley and they can't say enough about how much they love their newly designed space.    Jake took an old 70's wood burning fireplace in our home and turned it into a modern show piece with a beautiful stone facade and cool modern electric fireplace.    We can't wait to remodel our bathrooms with DVC :)
