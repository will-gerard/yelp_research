Anthony, Lauden, and Joey are rockstars! They went above and beyond with their moving service. I have a sectional couch that needed to be moved from my second story balcony which they did without hesitation. They were quick and efficient! They even made a pit stop to drop off some of my belongings at a storage unit. I will use these guys again!

Not impressed with their food at all. I had the chicken schwerma which was super dry, chewy, and chopped up into little bits. It came with a poor serving side salad which was mostly tomatoes. Their garlic paste/sauce had too much garlic, to the point it was overwhelming to smell much less eat. My boyfriend had a chicken alsham rack that was $10 which contained more dry chicken and some pickles. Needless to say, it wasn't worth the price. It was my first time here and sadly my last time. Pita Jungle is way better! At least Pita Jungle makes their own pitas, this place certainly does not.
