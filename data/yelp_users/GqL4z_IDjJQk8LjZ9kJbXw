Not even sure where to begin.  BAD.  VERY BAD.  Most of the meats were a gray color, the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow...and we waited FOREVER for bad food.  After we'd waited thirty minutes, the waitress came out and said they did not have any more of the entree we ordered.  That took you 30 minutes to figure out?  And let us not forget the decor!  Wait, that's mean...there was NO decor so no need to comment on that!  NEVER, EVER AGAIN.

Yahoo to discovering AZ88!!!  Just stopped by for drinks with a new friend last night but damn was it fun!  Really nice vibe, beautiful space with a truly elegant yet casual feel (who knew this was possible) and killer cocktails.  I learned how to slurp last night since your martini glass is filled so full you have no choice but to bend over the bar and slurp from your stemware!  Heard that that is how the bartenders can spot a newbie: newbies essentially spill all over the bar...or was I drunk by that second dirty martini?  Cannot wait to go back for a burger...and so damn close to Casa NR!

If there is a heaven, God greets you with a plate of pimento cheese dip from LGO accompanied by warm tortilla chips!  Once you are settled in, you find an A-Z cookie on your pillow when it is time for bed.  YUMMY, YUMMY!

Been to other Five Guys and loved it...but this was an epic fail.  Should have known when the guy in the grey t-shirt kept questioning the guy in the red t-shirt about when he was going to drop the fries.  Can anyone say raw potatoes here?  Worst fries I have ever had.  And it was obvious by looking at them that they were not done...SO SAD!  Burger and dog were OK but ruined by my disappointment...and not great service to boot.  Will not be back.

I almost cried during my meal here because Phoenix needs this restaurant SO BADLY.  It's hip and kind of elegant at the same time with stylized comfort food that's familiar but new at the same time.    The cheddar scallion biscuits with bacon jam and a sunny side up quail egg...sublime!  Basil risotto was simply perfect and a great vegetarian option.  And while the lemon blueberry cheesecake was good, the accompanying tortilla ice cream changed my life; I could have eaten an entire plate of the ice cream alone.  Blue Hound is attached to the new Hotel Palomar, which is also well worth a visit, if only to see the ultra cool Arizona wing back chairs which I now want for my living room!

Amazing service, hip yet not trying too hard vibe, color everywhere!  Actually loved that there was color throughout hotel as I did not realize how beige the desert really was until I got to sit in The Saguaro lobby.  Gotta be sure you dine at Distrito once open (which is tomorrow).  Had a ton of fun here!
