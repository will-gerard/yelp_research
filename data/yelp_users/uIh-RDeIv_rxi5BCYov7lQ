Kickass place!  The attention to detail is what really makes this place work.   The price is higher than a what a college student on a budget should  spend on a men's haircut, so if you are a coupon shopper or aren't looking to spend more than $8 on your haircut, you probably shouldn't be seeking out the nicest place in town. Complaining about an expensive cut at Emerson Joseph is like complaining about an expensive hotel room at the Ritz Carlton. It's obvious what your getting into from the second you walk through the door.   Bottom line: You get what you pay for here and if you are someone who cares about quality, this is your spot.

This place is a total let down for how good their food is.  The two twin ladies that run the place have the worst customer service ever.  They are robots and do not engage customers at all.  Also,  they have began limiting the amount of Mac salad one can order.   Who has ever heard of a restaurant limiting what a customer can order?  I used to love it but now avoid it all costs because the owners do not have a clue, and I will not let someone limit the amount of Mac salad I can eat.
