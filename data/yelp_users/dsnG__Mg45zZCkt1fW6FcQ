I was DREADING wedding dress shopping. Spoke with a friend, who also is engaged, and she said it was one of the most horrible experiences of her life. My family finally convinced me to go since I'm starting to cut it close (wedding is 7 months away).   I found a beautiful dress on Pinterest and my mom called around to see who might carry it. Suzanne's had it and let me come in within 2 hours of calling to try it on. It wasn't the one but Mo helped me find dresses that were flattering and I fell in love with one I never would've picked out for myself. Needless to say, it was the one and I'm so grateful for Mo and her patience. Would definitely recommend! I felt very comfortable and really appreciated the advice and recommendations.

Thank you for RUINING our anniversary. My boyfriend and I had a gift card to Ra and Bandera, and we decided to grab a quick bite at Ra since it was their 15th anniversary and dessert and wine at Bandera. During our 'quick bite' we were towed from the parking lot because we didn't have 'dinner' at Bandera, even though we showed a receipt of giving them business. $150 tow fee and absolute rudeness from the Manager  later, we will not be back, nor will we recommend to anyone.
