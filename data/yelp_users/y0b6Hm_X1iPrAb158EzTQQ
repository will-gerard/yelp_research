I had an ant from hell problem.  I bought sprays, powders, tried every holistic method I could find online.  I swear the ants laughed at me!  If I laid out powder they shimmied through it and danced together to show me nothing would stop them.  My dogs food, my sink, my pantry, my spice cabinet...nothing was sacred!  Then I called DK Buell when a friend referred me to them.  Literally from the moment they sprayed until now (months and months later) I have yet to see an ant in my home.    Their method was safe and effective.  I have 3 dogs and 4 kids so non-toxic was a major concern of mine.  There were no complications or problems--unless you had six legs and an exoskeleton!  I am so happy I stopped fighting a losing battle and called DK Buell.  It was honestly the best money I spent on my insect war.  I cannot say thank you enough.

Check your bags folks!!! I drove the 40 min round trip journey to get the highly requested In-and-Out for dinner. Like an idiot I didn't check my bag before driving home. Unlike other fast food chains this place has never messed up my order so I've been lulled into a false sense of security.   Upon arrival at home I discovered 4 burgers for my 5 person family. Like any good mother I graciously handed my children food and watched them savor each bite (while secretly wanting to throw an adult temper tantrum).  Lesson learned? Always check your bag no matter how on point a place usually is. Everyone assures me their food was delicious. I can vouch the fries were good...but alas I am out not only my money, but my personal dinner as well.

as local pizza goes this place kicks the pants off of chain pizza places.  yea the decor is dated and the place doesn't impress visually, but last i checked pizza should taste good!  i love their crust, their sauce, their cheese, and the way their pizza reminds me of east coast yumminess!    the staff isn't the chattiest staff, but they make your food fast and bring it to your table.  they are polite and that's all that matters to me.  i don't want chit chat.  i want to stuff my face with your greasy delicious pizza!  the pizza is so good my 13 yr old will actually offer to buy the whole family dinner with his saved money if i take them to marios.  when a 13 yr old will part with cash just so he can eat pizza you know it's good!  the wings are decent, the pizza is great with generous toppings, and the sandwiches are yummy too.  the kids love the french fries, but i don't think you can mess up fries :P

This place is awesome hands down.  The front desk staff is super friendly and helpful.  The relaxation room is stocked with some nibbles, cookies, and water.  It's nice to munch on a lil something while waiting.  My problem is I never have time to nibble because as soon as I sit down, my waxer always shows up!  I have never had to sit and wait for my appointments!  Tiffany bar none is the best waxer and facial giver in the valley.  If she ever leaves my eyebrows will be ridiculous because I trust no one else with them!  I've had a few massages here, and every time has been a good massage.  The hand/foot massage seemed way too short for the price and I honestly would say I will never get one again.  For the price I will get a swedish and ask them to focus more on the feet and hands.  Otherwise the massage was excellent!  Love love love love this place.  I even drive out of my way from Surprise just to come down and support a local owned business versus chains (yes Massage Envy I'm talking about you!!).  I try to always support local businesses, and in this case I have never ever been wrong about where my dollars are spent.  Thank you for my escape to bliss every time I visit the spa!

So I typically check into a place, and maybe leave a quick tip.  My experience tonight has inspired me to FINALLY write a review.  This is not a good thing.  For me to take the time to write a full review takes some serious impression upon me from the restaurant.  In this case, the impression was so piss poor I couldn't help but come home and sit down directly to cyber-lambast our evening's activity.  This Buffalo Wild Wings has been closed for over a year, and I honestly think they should either A) hire a competent staff with a great manager or B) close their doors again because they clearly have no idea what they are doing as a team.    To begin, we are a party of 6, well 5 1/2 since the baby doesn't count as fully human yet.  We were told that a booth that seats 6 would open up momentarily and would we mind a brief wait.  No sweat.  I like sitting on my husband's lap, but NOT at dinner in a restaurant.  After sitting for a few we were told to follow the host.  He sat us down at a small booth that literally squished me up against my husband and the baby's car seat.  When I questioned "Is this the booth for 6?  It's awfully small." The host said, "No this seats 4, but you could wait if you want for the large booth."  I thought we had made that choice already, but I suppose ignoring your customer's preference is ok. The host said he could bring a car seat sling since we were squashed.  Having 3 older hungry children I acquiesced to his offer.  Our server appeared promptly, and she was very upbeat.  OK, things were getting better.  She took our drink orders and gave individualized attention to the children which was great.  My husband ordered a beer, we all ordered sodas.  She returned with the sodas and said the beer was on the way.  She took our appetizer order and the meal order.  She asked if we would like the appetizer before the entree and we said yes. The beer still hadn't arrived.  When she checked in a few mins later the beer STILL hadn't found it's way to the table.  She personally grabbed it from the bar.  As my husband took the first sip he noted that the beer was skunked.  (bad flavor, sat out and got warm and then was re-chilled).  he mentioned this to the server and she stated "Oh yea we have some issues with beer at the bar getting bad.  Happens a lot."  Really????  So at this point the entrees come to the table.  Where is the appetizer??  No one knows.  Also the carrot/celery order magically changed into 4 orders of celery.  The server says she will check with the kitchen about the status of the appetizer and grab some carrots as well.  We just started eating our food because we were hungry.  Now the food was good.  I can't complain about the wings at all.  The kids liked their kids meals.  The portions were good.  This was the ONLY saving grace of the evening.  The server comes back with carrots and says the appetizer is coming.  We keep eating and notice there are no extra napkins.  With chicken wings you sorta need napkins...wings are messy.  We are messy. Our fingers and faces are messy.  It's hard to feed a squirmy 9 month old and try not to get the hot sauces on our fingers mixed with the not hot food she's eating.    The appetizer still is MIA.  At this point all the kids are done eating.  I am full.  I am requesting a box.  My husband is done eating.  He asks for a non-skunked beer.  The beer comes and the appetizer is STILL not there.  The server says "Do you want the kitchen to just box up the appetizer?"  The nice lady I am says outloud "Yea I guess so."  The furious b***h inside me says silently "You can tell the kitchen to shove the appetizer up their A$$"  So we get an appetizer in a box well after the entree to go home with.  We ordered a sampler platter (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, nachos, and some wings) none of which is too tasty after getting cold and spending a night in a fridge.    We pay our full bill...not even a sorry was offered.  I honestly didn't even feel like paying the $12 for the platter but I was just too disappointed to say anything.  We rarely go out to eat since we are a large family.  Spending $100 for dinner just isn't always in our budget.  I didn't want to mar the evening for the kids by complaining.  They thought everything was terrific, so I let them maintain that belief.    When I got home I opened the sampler platter just to see what was in there....the three sauces were in the box with no lids and the sauces had managed to spill on everything and mix together.  I now have a bunch of snacks swimming in a melange of ranch, cheese sauce, and marinara....not my idea of a flavor explosion.    We don't eat out often, and it's experiences like these that keep me from wanting to go dine out.  I know it's a chain and not Chez Robertfancypants, but I expect my appetizers at the table before the meal and most certainly not in a box after the meal has been eaten.  Sorry Wild Wings.....we gave you a shot, but I don't think I want to drop $100 again.  Ever.

i don't know what the hoopla was all about to honest.  the service was good for the amount of people in line, but the food was just eh.  i got kali mist which sounded awesome.  bacon, turkey, avocado, pepper jack, veggies, chipotle mayo?  sign me up!  i started eating and was disappointed.  onions galore and lettuce to spare....but one, yes only one piece of bacon.  that's a tragedy right there.  i could barely find the cheese...trust me, i looked.  the ingredients that matter (and cost a bit more) were sparse while the ingredients that are cheap were in abundance.    i will stick to my own sandwiches at home.  i can't justify spending $10 for a big ole hunk of bread stuffed with veggies but lacking in the good stuff :/  i was bumming hard about the bacon and still am sad!

You don't know what Italian water ice is???  Well, I am sorry to tell you that you haven't lived until you have tried one of the BEST ways to beat the heat with a sweet treat in Arizona.    The staff here is super nice, always lets you try the samples, and you actually HAVE to try the samples!  The stock here rotates so the flavors are constantly changing.  One day they have mango, another it's pineapple mango, then they have green apple....there is ALWAYS a new flavor to be tried at every visit.  The peach, banana, mango, passion fruit, and pineapple mango are ridiculously delicious.    My kids love this place and beg to stop all the time!!  They have an app for your phone that allows for a free water ice every 8th visit.  Free stuff is AWESOME!!  I  highly recommend the gelati as well as the water ice.  My son adores the custard, and my daughter swears by their milkshakes.  My kids are picky and rarely is there a place where everyone finds something they want...Ritas always pleases the troops.   LOVE this place!!  I'm so glad a Ritas finally made it to the valley, and I hope they never leave!

The staff here was excellent!! They were great with my kids, and didn't mind my baby crawling around the whole store. They got the exams done quickly and efficiently.  When it came down to picking frames they were patient and let my kids try on nearly every frame. They didn't rush them and treated them like the only customer in the shop. Both kids ended up picking frames that not only looked good, but the staff made sure that felt good on their faces. As first time glass users the kids has no clue about all day glass comfort.  I'd totally recommend these guys to anyone looking for a super positive experience :)
