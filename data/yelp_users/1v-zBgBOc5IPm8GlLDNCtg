Absolutely, positively the BEST! I was told to go to Guiseppe's for the Pasta Alex by a man who works in food and beverage sales here in the valley. My expectations were very high because of how my friend lit up when he described this place. From start to finish, my first experience was flawless. I walked in and literally heard a table towards the front of the dining room arguing in Italian with each other, pinch me! I was welcomed, the owner introduced himself to me, showed me pictures of his kids on the wall and described the specials. I told him I thought the special with braised pork shoulder sounded amazing, but that I promised a friend is try the pasta Alex. He said in a thick Italian accent, "I'll take care of you son". He arranged a version of the special with the pasta Alex sauce and a small side of pasta Alex which I ate until my plate was spotless, thanks to the fresh bread.  I could go on all day. I've been back 10 times and had equally rewarding experiences. I've sent several friends in and they've all said the same. If you go and don't enjoy it, either you don't like good food or you have a psychiatric condition and should seek medical attention. In that case Mayo is just up Scottsdale Rd.

Stay away from this place because it's too yummy, you can't handle it. The Philly chee steak sandy made me feel like hurting all the other posers who had been selling me cheese steak lies previously. Plus, the friendly guy behind the register recommended that I add avocado. Who knew?? Flavor shotgun blast to my dome!

Best skate shop I've ever visited! The guys are super cool and ready to go the extra mile. I wanted a commuter longboard and the guys recommended the perfect ride!  Don't order your stuff online, keep our local skate shops busy! Plus, you'll get expert help, quick repairs and support your community!  Thanks Sidewalk Surfer, you guys rock!

Expensive for breakfast but worth it. Friendly cute staff, plenty of creative menu items and free wifi. The protein pancakes are gonna make you smile and if you are trying to hydrate this is your place. They serve every table with an iced and lemoned pitcher of aqua. The mural of America was fun to study.

Seriously people, stop going to LA Fitness! It is a business that is fading fast. They bought up tons of gyms, built tons of new ones and became the wal-mart of gyms. Their contracts are a rip-off, their trainers are the absolute bottom of the barrel and their clubs are dirty and crowded.

Y'all already know. It's a Southern thing, brought out here to provide delicious fried chicken with a smile and a very subtle Southern Baptist sense of humility and service. You'll NEVER have inconsistent quality. Your kids will love it. It's impossible to get sick of it. I grew up near the original, I will never live more than a mile from a branch of this staple.

Absolutely the best gym dollar for dollar in the valley! They have recently expanded which gives the gym a really roomy feeling. Great machines that are maintained and clean, plenty of bumper plates for crossfit or Olympic lifting and a wide open turf area for sprinting, tire flipping and sled pushing. The people who workout here are serious about fitness and very friendly. It's a cool crowd, unlike some big chain gyms in the area. Lots of trainers use this gym and are independent contractors so you can choose from a variety of expert trainers.  The staff are accommodating and friendly. Mark, the manager really cares about the satisfaction of his members and Josh up front is super cool! Inexpensive, clean, no B.S.and plenty of fit people and pretty women to keep you motivated!

My wife and I were the only people in the place this Monday night so the service was above and beyond. The Chop Salad was legit, the osso bucco was near perfect. I've paid a lot more for a whole lot less in the past.

I am a chiropractor, this is where I go to get adjusted.  Dr. Thoma is the most knowledgeable chiropractor I have ever known.  When I started under Dr. Thoma's care I had very bad mid-back pain due to strenuous exercise and a stressful lifestyle.  Dr. Thoma took and analyzed my x-rays in the most detailed manner possible.  He discovered that my spinal alignment was in need of some major improvement.  Through his adjustments and the corrective exercises he prescribed me I am now pain free and feel better than I did when I was a teenager!  Thank you Dr. Thoma, I'm so glad I found you!!

Dr. John Thoma is a healer.  As a chiropractor myself, I am under Dr. Thoma's care because I know he is one of the best.  His knowledge is beyond belief and his care is specifically tailored to meet my needs with regards to addressing spinal misalignment as well as muscle imbalance.  Because Dr. Thoma was an elite athletic trainer for years before becoming a chiropractor, he understands a huge spectrum of biomechanical issues that are helpful in the care of his patients.

I'm surprised there are only two other not-so-great reviews. The small business, good vibe that used to exist here is gone. Under new ownership, this place has gone from a neighborhood treasure to a place to avoid. Before, I would go in for a new tube and a small repair and it would be done promptly and I'd feel like I'd been given a fair price (many times I wouldn't have to pay for labor if the parts were easy to install). The past 3 times I've been in, I've been charged for parts, installation and additional fees for simple tasks. Also, during each visit I've witnessed or overheard rude comments from the staff about customer stupidity. If you're looking for a place to feel condescension from an elite staff of arrogant hourly employees, here's your nirvana. I understand businesses need to make money and that retail is annoying at times, but I'll gladly drive a few extra miles to avoid more punishment.

Great food, solid service and a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. My coffee cup never went below half full and my pancakes where inspired. I'll be back and would recommend Morning Squeeze, "The Squeeze" to anyone!

Absolutely perfect!! I've been around CrossFit since 2006 and I've never been to a gym so focused on its members. The owner, his wife and coaches are highly intelligent, well educated, and willing to share all they know with every single client. The level of personal care my wife was given throughout her pregnancy and after returning from the birth of our second child moved me to write this review. These folks whipped her back into phenomenal shape in short order, while simultaneously considering her unique circumstance and personal goals. If you think you'll get that from a standard gym/personal trainer, you're dead wrong. In a place like this, you'll find value, neighborly friends, a family oriented staff and humble, knowledgable professionals who share a passion for your fitness.  If you live any place close to the intersection of Cactus and Shea, pay these folks a visit, you'll thank me!

This guy can do anything! He remodeled my master bathroom, rearranged the plumbing, installed a whirlpool, added a shower, dropped in new vanities and lighting. His work was honest, fast and less expensive than I imagined it would be by a mile. Thanks Matt!

Just exactly what I needed. An attorney with an honest approach and relentless. My confusion and anxiety were handled with a confident smile. Mr. Albee's council in my case was priceless. I felt at ease and even enjoyed some laughs during a high-stress point in my life. Highly recommended to anyone, family, friends and fellow Yelpers.
