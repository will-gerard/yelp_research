The doctors and staff at East Maryland Animal Hospital are truly exceptional. I have tried several pet care providers over the past 10 years and never has any one come close to the level of care and customer service we receive at East Maryland.   My sweet pit-hound Sunday and I first arrived at EMAH in the panic of a serious health crisis. Her then regular vet's office was unable to diagnose her growing list of symptoms, and we were dismissed with the advice to "probably prepare for the worst".   Our visit to East Maryland to seek a second opinion yielded a completely different (and wonderful!) outcome.   Her doctor was able to immediately get the diagnostic tests needed to determine a treatment plan, she consulted with several specialists by phone, and even coordinated an appointment for us with another specialty provider that very same day.   Flash-forward five years later and my furry bestest girl is still by my side. The exceedingly competent, compassionate care we received at that first visit has remained consistent over the years, and I couldn't more highly recommend a provider to entrust with your furry loved ones.

From the pastoral wall mural and the wine bottles lining the shelves to the vintage ad posters, Tutti Santi is exactly what you envision when you think EYE-TAL-YON. And by that, I mean the decor is a little cliched.  What isn't cliched are the authentic homemade pastas and attentive service.  Without a reservation, we were greeted and sat immediately on a Saturday night. The server told us a bit about the place and seemed near bursting with pride as he described the house specialties. I almost expected him to bring his fingers to his mouth and make an exaggerated smacking kiss. He didn't, but that would have been awesome.  We started out with salad greens and cream of asparagus soup, both were simple and flavorful. The gnocchi and ricotta spinach ravioli that everyone on here is raving about? The best I've ever had. We couldn't decide between the two, so our server offered to do half and half- brilliant.  We also had the special of the night, Veal Oscar (veal cutlets in a Marsala sauce topped with fontina, asparagus, and crab meat), with a side of penne pomodoro. The pasta outshined the veal for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes. The portions are on the generous side and left us unable to even contemplate dessert- still we left with enough leftovers for an entire meal.  I'm not sure when I'll be back, it's a bit pricey for a casual dinner (for my pocketbook), and the ambiance was a little too lacking to make it a special "date night" spot. I do know I'm going to be thinking about those ravioli for a long time, though.

Disclaimer: I had a terrible experience with a stylist here, but will make an attempt to keep my venom from poisoning the rest of the review. It has been about two months since my visit, and  I can now look in the mirror without seething so I thought it was time to put it on record. Here goes...  The Digs: Salon Boulevard is in a convenient spot for Phoenicians in the Moon Valley area, located in the LA Fitness complex right next to Half Moon Bar & Grill. The interior itself is on the smallish side and what you might typically expect from a strip-mall salon.  The Walk-in: Feeling a bit lackluster after a bout of Pilates, I decided a trim was just the thing to put some bounce back into my locks - lo and behold! There was Boulevard Salon and their" Walk-ins Welcome" sign. Serendipity.  The front desk person was very busy, but friendly, and said she could get me in with a stylist in 15 minutes whose price would be $35 for a trim. Sweet! She asked if she could bring me some coffee and invited me to have a seat. After about 10 minutes and no cafe au lait, I simply got up and served myself. Not a moment later, Ms. X fetched me for my cut.  She took my cup, set it at her station, and immediately led me to the sinks and began shampooing without even looking at my hair while it was dry or asking what I wanted. Back at her station, I told her I just wanted a trim and my side-swept bangs maintained, to which she replied "Yes, yes, something plain. I see you are a plain girl." Um...ok, lady.  To make a long story short, Ms. X spilled my coffee on me, dabbed ferociously at my crotch, yammered ceaselessly without ever waiting for a response, then gave me a whole new hairstyle of her choosing that was some sort of long bob with butchered bangs that ended up too uneven to do anything with but pin back. And the icing? She wanted $5 more to blow dry.   Since I left "wet" I didn't realize the extent of the devastation until I returned home to dry and style. I'm ashamed to say I even thanked her for the mutilation of my head. And tipped. *sigh*.   The other clientele seemed smiley and unaccosted. At the time of my visit, it was mostly older ladies getting their curls set under the dryers, though I believe they are a full-service salon and offer several waxing and nail treatments as well.  The Resolution: In the end, I did call Ms. X back that day on her cell and left a message explaining that I would not be returning to the salon and why. I regret not speaking to a manager to give the business a chance to make amends. As it is, I do not plan to return. I even park as far away from the place as possible when going to the gym. And I'm still waiting for one side of my bangs to grow back long enough to get them fixed.

Friendly nail techs, lots of massage chairs, and services are a steal! I've been getting my toes pampered here for several years and not one negative experience.   Tip: Make an appointment if you're short on time. They have always been completely accommodating, but It's not unusual to walk in to a full salon at any time of the day, with  waits up to 20 minutes.

One minute you're cruising on the freeway and the next you're running over a massive tire tread, which you believe to be a body or a chupacabra, that has been ejected violently onto your hood from the truck in from of you. Needless to say, you need some auto body work.  My insurance directed me to Auto Body World for an appointment that I thought would be about as pleasurable as a trip to the dentist. Wrong! Auto Body World and its fabulous, friendly staff proved a pleasure to work with from start to finish.  Front office staff: Awesome. Estimate guy (I don't really know what the title is): Awesome. Technicians: AWESOME!  They had me in and out the door in less than 15 minutes for my initial appointment, repaired my car ahead of schedule, then graciously processed my paperwork and returned my vehicle  when I accidentally showed up 30 minutes after closing time. And all of this with a smile.  Another plus? There is an Enterprise rental car service on site just for their customers' use - and they offer great discounts through your insurance carrier even if your rental isn't covered by your plan.  And did I mention my car looks like new? I couldn't recommend this business and location more highly.

This place has my number. There just isn't a thing I don't love about Pizzeria Bianco. It would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional Stuff Lori Likes list: "Waiting at least two hours, fueled by a jammy red, to eat some pizza at 10:00 at night". Naturally, good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given. Once, I showed up and there was no wait. I went next door first anyway. Call me crazy, but life goes by too fast. I like the wait.   After an hour or two and some vino, the antipasto is a must for starters. Local seasonal veggies wood-roasted and drenched in olive oil, cured meat, olives, and some cheese; it doesn't get much better- except when gorgeous heirloom beets are on the platter. Nothing beats 'em (don't groan, it's impolite).   The Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness, one and all. My personal faves are the Rosa (pungent aged cheese, grilled red onions, and pistachios), the Margherita with prosciutto, and the Wiseguy (smoked mozzarella, grilled onions and sliced fennel sausage). And yes, I named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites.   Housed in an historic building, the atmosphere is rustic and homey. A little candlelight and an open kitchen make me feel like I'm at a friend's home for dinner - and in some ways I am. My first trip to Bianco was 13 years ago when my now husband took me for my 21st birthday; we've been going ever since.   Maybe that's why the wait never bothers me. With consistently attentive, first-name service and so many familiar faces, it feels less like dinner out and more like an evening among friends.

I have been going to one Valle Luna or another for the past 15 years. Their food is standard Mexican-in-Arizona and plentiful for the most part, but guess what I just found out? THEY HAVE GREAT CHICKEN WINGS!   I know, weird, huh? My faves are the honey-hot, fried and grilled.

Skip the sushi rolls, and give the specials and sumibiyaki a try...  Don't get me wrong, the sushi menu offerings I've ordered here have been great, but where Yasu really shines are its crudo-style dishes and charcoal-grilled meat and fish (sumibiyaki).  Favorites include tuna carpaccio drizzled with wasabi cream and topped with pistachios and sprouts, sliced himachi dressed in citrus olive oil and served with jalapenos and cherry tomatoes, and grilled Black Cod in a sweet and syrupy miso glaze. They also serve a scrumptious fois fras with Japanese eggplant that's so rich I like to order it as my dessert...MMMmmmmmm.  In regard to the service, it can be really hit or miss. I've enjoyed fabulous recommendations and received top-notch attention on a few vists, and I've also experienced the complete opposite with bungled orders, bad timing, and absentee wait staff.   Service issues aside, when I'm craving raw fish and want something a little different, Yasu is usually up to the challenge.

A recent trip with my husband to Yasu  last Saturday night began with being ignored, followed by more ignoring, and ended with being ignored as we left. I was not even wearing my cloak of invisibility.  We waited at the hostess stand for five minutes before being greeted (even though the hostess made several trips to the podium without any acknowledgement) and were then directed to the bar where we sat another five minutes without being greeted or offered a beverage. We did however, stare at the bartender while he ate something and ignored us.  We went to Roka Akor.

Dear Yard House,  Myself largely being a patron of independently owned eateries, you tarnish my semi-conscientious restaurant going habits by luring me into your chain establishment. Over and over again.  Had you not so many varied and delicious ales, stouts, lagers, and lambics on your taps, were your onion rings not served in a veritable ring toss of obscene heights, did your happy hour not make me quite so happy, then maybe, MAYBE I could resist your heated/cooled patio so perfectly poised for people watching.  Alas, your Cuban pork dip sandwich begs to be shared. Your chicken nachos beckon me softly. Even your sliders (regular, turkey, or Korean BBQ) sing out my name in a trio of tiny voices; I cannot resist their siren song.  I am a ruined woman.  Unfailingly Yours, Lori   Pros: Great happy hour, M-F, 3-6, reverse happy hour S-Thur, 10-midnight. People watching patio (I like to guess what movies people are going to see based on appearances), friendly service, unmatched beer list.  Cons: Wait can be lengthy at prime times, service can be slow when busy. Chain:(

I made a reservation for Donovan's prix fixe menu during AZ Restaurant Week. Sadly, the overall experience was lacking in almost every respect.  * We arrived about five minutes early for our reservation and were told we would "be sat nearer our reservation time" - we were eventually sat more than 20 minutes after our reservation time. Whatever happened to "Sorry, we're running behind"? 'Sorry' being the keyword here.  * Once seated, our waiter was pointed out to us, but we were never greeted. The gentleman who brought water to our table returned several times to ask if the waiter had been to our table. After about ten minutes, the same gentleman (aka busboy) said he would be taking our orders.  * We were told there would be a choice of four potato preparations, but were not asked to specify. What arrived were some enormous mounds of very sad 'mashed' potatoes- there was at least a quarter of a whole potato on my plate that seemed to escape the masher!  * We both ordered med-rare beef medallions, but the butchering was terrible: my medallions were plump and lovely, my husband's duplicate order looked more like thin cutlets.  * Our actual waiter stopped by the table and introduced himself midway through our entrees, which, by the way, looked like they were plated for a cafeteria.  Complaints aside (and there are a lot, I know!), the beef was delicious, the bartender was friendly and efficient despite the standing room only conditions, and the valet was literally running to make parking smooth and hassle-free.  I left feedback on Opentable.com and, to Donovan's credit, received a polite and prompt response with an offer to make amends.

One thing I really like about Roka is its versatility: you can visit several times and have a totally different experience each time. Relax in the loungey bar area and take advantage of the all-night happy hour tidbits, sit at the sushi/robata bar and schmooze with the chefs and enjoy their recommendations, or grab a private table and sit back for some pampering.  The food is just as versatile. The bar menu offers several cooked and raw dishes, and the happy hour prices can't be beat (give the shochu infusions a try, too). Dining menus include traditional sushi preparations, innovative raw fish, and several cooked options - including the hands-down best miso black cod I've tasted.  I've tried the Kaiseke tasting menu ($68 pp), five courses culled from the sushi bar and the robata grill, and the deluxe sushi platter ($38). Both were enjoyable, but the robata portions of the Kaseki menu were way too large for my appetite; on the other hand, I was still quite hungry after finishing the sashimi platter and ended up splitting a full dinner entree with my dining companion.  Service has always been attentive, and the restaurant has some really beautfiul details. In my opinion, it's the type of place that's comfortable for a casual dinner, but is still worthy of a special occasion.

Casual and comfortable, Yen isn't a see-and-be-seen place, but it sure hits the spot when you're craving some sushi. And for the record, it does have quite a bit more ambiance (read low lighting, muted decor, and pillowed benches) than several other places of its size and relative location.  Let's get to the important stuff: the food. I've been here a few times and never had anything less than fresh, quality fish. Toro, Sake, Hamachi, we've had it sashimi style and in funky-good rolls. Unagi and Tuna tataki are top notch, too. Among my favorites are the Sunset Roll (crab mix and avocado roll topped with salmon, sliced lemon, and rooster sauce), and the heart attack (think jalapeno poppers stuffed with seafood).  They have great happy hour discounts on drinks and food, but for me the hh menu is a little one-dimensional with mostly tempura items. I love me a deal, but I would suggest mixing in a few regular menu items to round out the experience.  Oh, and don't dine here if you're in a time crunch. The service has always been courteous, friendly - and beyond slow. I usually enjoy a slower pace, but it's nice to have a full water glass and a drinky-poo to help pass the time.

$8 / pp cover starting at 7 pm on a Saturday. 20 minutes until we were even greeted by our server. $12 for a Stoli martini. 100 decibels of loud, though not particularly enthusiastic, piano bar standards.   The numbers don't lie, this place is pretty lame. Looking for a sing-a-long piano bar experience? Head to Tempe where you'll get more 'Bang' for your buck.

Is it "Location! Location! Location!" or "Ambiance! Ambiance! Ambiance!"? The Mission has both; it's in an ideal location to begin a night out on the town, and the restaurant's low lighting and sexy decor will had me feeling just as spicy as the Latin-infused fare.  My favorite dish, hands down, was a side of creamy grits with chipotle and honey. Everything was tasty, duck empanadas, pork belly pibl, guacamole, though nothing especially stood out as much as that humble side of grits mixed with perfection.  The service was a little over-attentive, but the guy was sweet and obviously trying his best. And he was Johnny-on-the-spot with the wine, so who can really complain about a few interruptions?   Sexy restaurant. Satisfying food.

If you consider yourself a foodie, you simply must add a visit to Posh to your gastronomic repertoire. And even if you're not a foodie but you are open to  adventure, Posh delivers a dining experience unlike any other in the Phoenix area.  The best advice I could give from my experience is go for eight courses. The minimum order is four, so my dining companion and I initially ordered six and as we arrived at the fifth course we opted to add two more. No regrets. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.   Each course was like a microcosm- a nearly whole experience in just a few bites. And yes, the portions are small (in one case even laughably so), but this is food constructed to be savored, not shoveled.  Waxing poetic aside, Posh is really, really fun. I recommend sitting at the open kitchen so you can watch the preparation. The service was attentive and friendly without any intrusion. Our server was very knowledgeable, and in the one instance we were able to stump him, he brought the man himself, Joshua Herbert, over with the answer.  The ambiance is welcoming, if a bit industrial, and diners were dressed in all manner of frocks from polos and khakis to evening attire.   With the ever-changing menu, there's little point in discussing specifics, but we enjoyed yummies like oysters, veal cheek, pork belly, wild boar, venison, skate, and fluke, all prepared beautifully. And if the sound of braised veal cheek sets your heart aflutter (in a good way) then close your browser already a book yourself a seat.   Oh- and leave yourself some extra time to park; locating the underground garage proved to be a task beyond my navigational capacity and we had to call the host twice for directions.

Scramble is home to one of the best breakfast entrees in town: slow down... wait for it... ta da! The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict! The fact that every single review does not focus solely on this morning opus to the Southwest confirms what I have always suspected: the dry heat has finally shriveled Phoenicians' tastebuds into tiny pieces of gravel.   I kid, I kid. The Santa Fe is poached eggs and ham atop oh-so-yummy jalapeno cornbread, smothered in a chipotle hollandasie. It's got a kick, so isn't for the faint of mouth, and I can see where it might be a bit rich for some, but for me and my entree-splitting spouse, it's the best of the Southwest on a plate.   I've also tried the caramel banana pancakes, the Scramble hash brown (think hash browns juicing on bacon and cheese), and the chorizo brizza (Brizza= breakfast+pizza. Get it?). The brizza was huge, and for me a huge miss. It made me feel sluggish and greasy just looking at it. Everything else? An A-OK.   Scramble offers order-at-the-counter service and the interior is bright and cheery. They also have a dog-friendly patio where they're always sweet to my pup, who loves Scramble because of the fussing, fawning, big water bowl, and occasional dropped breakfast potato.   Pros: Yumminess, fast service, cheerful interior, large patio, dog-friendly.   Cons: Paper coffee cups (I'm stubborn and I want a cermaic MUG!), cross-armed frowners who complain about the quickly moving line.

3.5 rounding up to 4 stars  When I think 'rustic', I think kuntry cookin', painted wooden signs with pithy sayings, and a hearty slathering of Paula Deen's cure-all: butter.  It didn't live up to its promise of rusticity for me, but Rustic Cafe has a lot of other things going for it, like great prices, lots of menu options, friendly service, and a bright, cheery, dining room with nary a sign spouting down-home wisdom in sight.   My first visit was on a Saturday morning and I administered the ultimate breakfast challenge: sausage and OM eggs with toast and hash browns. Sounds simple, right? You'd be surprised. Rustic Cafe, however, had no problem delivering the goods: hot, timely, and perfectly cooked. The hubs ordered biscuits and gravy, and though he thought the gravy was a little under spiced, he said he would absolutely go back.  On another visit for lunch I split the gyro (which I don't think can be classified as 'rustic' unless you pronounce it  JY-RO) and french fries. It was just the right size for sharing and gob-smacking good. They even added pickles and extra toms at no extra charge. BO-NUS!  This is definitely a no-frills neighborhood place, but it's one I hope will be around for a long time. Maybe even long enough to get 'rustic'.  P.S. I think it's really more of a 'Nod to Nostalgia Cafe'. With brightly colored tiling on the wall and a couple of classic car prints, it seemed kind of  50s diner-esque, without the kitsch.

The reviews are true: FnB serves top-notch fare to nourish your body and soul. Can you say leek gratin? It's pronounced "goo-eee dee-lish-ish-ness". As in 'heaven'. As in, did I mention it was topped with a perfectly poached (local, organic) egg?  The space is itty bitty, but the ambiance is intimate and effortlessly charming (kind of un-Scottsdale, do I dare say?). Do yourself a favor: make a reservation. They were totally booked when I visited around 8 pm on a Wednesday night.  With a focus on AZ wines and locally sourced ingredients, this would be a great spot to bring out-of-town guests or potential in-laws you'd like to impress with your sustainable eating habits and sophisticated palate. Just make sure that if the in-law thing doesn't work out, then you get dibs on this place after the break-up. It's really too small to run into an ex without things getting awkward.  Speaking of awkward, our server described in a detailed and faintly condescending lecture EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON THE MENU. It felt like an episode of Portlandia. I did not ask if he knew the chicken's name or how it got along with the other chickens, but it took all of my willpower. All of it. Which means I had no willpower left to resist eating more than my fair share of leek heaven. Or dessert. Pronounced "yum yum yum".  I do love the locavore concept and the thoughtfulness behind the food. And I plan to return, even if a lengthy lecture is part of the menu.

Mostly rave reviews on Yelp led me to Le Chalet, a unique little indie restaurant amid the strip malls and Super Targets of the West Valley.  Despite the fifty-some-odd write-ups, I wasn't sure what to expect. I read something about an ice cave, live comedy, hanging man meat, and surveillance cameras, but despite these oddities what drew me in was the promise of expertly crafted crepes and the opportunity to see the chefs do their stuff on a closed circuit TV.  Le Chalet did not disappoint. Sit in the front dining area to view the chefs at work in the open kitchen, or take a seat in the dining area by the bar where two flat screens showcase the action at the crepe griddles. The Bretonne crepe with ham, mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and a sunny-side up egg was superb, and I can't wait to go back and try the La Landaise, blinis topped with seared fois gras, apple, and balsamic glaze.  I also tried La Potence (the "hanging man"), filet medallions served on a medieval looking mace, seared tableside with bourbon and served with a pineapple slice, rice, and some mayo-based dipping sauces. Thoroughly enjoyable, but next time I would opt instead for a cheese fondue or the melted Raclette plate with cured meats, which looked delicious.  The ambiance seemed a bit strange to me, but homey and comfortable. And yes, there is a sculpted ice cave for performances, The night I attended was slated for "clean comedy" and I made it a point to get out of there despite some morbid curiosity (I'm not an amateur comedy fan, and the idea of family-friendly comedy made me even more anxious).  The handsome server was very attentive and knowledgeable, and I loved the half-carafe option when ordering wine. I wouldn't classify Le Chalet as a "fondue place", where the experience often outshines the food; it's more of a casual cozy spot that serves up thoughtfully prepared comfort cuisine - all the ingredients for a lovely dinner out.

In 20 words or less: Hamachi with grapefruit, avocado, and white truffle ponzu oil. Just do it. You won't regret it.  Great location, cozy ambiance, eclectic wine and spirits menu, and absolutely stellar food. Standouts were the aforementioned hamachi, and eggplant with bacon and red miso. Foie gras with apples and a red wine reduction was a decadent indulgence, and pork belly buns were a filling, comfort food complement to more composed dishes.   Service was great; the staff was very knowledgeable and accommodating. A fabulous night out, I can't wait for a repeat visit. Hamachi hamachi hamachi hamachi hamachi!

At length: A trip to Kauai for our friends' wedding several years back led us to Puka Dog and the discovery of another type of holy matrimony: the perfect union of frankfurters and tropical fruit. Our friends are still together eight years later, but how my hot dogs have longed for the companionship of a little pineapple and banana relish.  Disconsolate from my long lost love, I have abstained from the hot dog community (except for Ted's, because it's amazing and what happens in Tempe, stays in Tempe) until a new beau arrived: Maui Dog.  In short (ish): Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got Maui Dog in my tummy. I tried the Sweet & Spicy Dog (favorite!!!) and the Lava Dog (messy!!!) and the house made fries. Everything was delish, and I'll be back to try the rest. The restaurant is a cute, clean, pseudo-dive (kind of a Two Hippies vibe) with a few tables inside and a dog-friendly patio (tee-hee). It's funky and it's affordable. Go ahead, try it. You just might fall in love.

Local Bistro definitely has a "cool" vibe, but luckily zero "too cool for you" attitude. With an accessible menu of French, Italian, and Spanish dishes, there is something for just about any palate or diet.   *Sexy, inviting, open dining area *Reasonable prices *Fantastic wine, beer, and cocktail options *Menu has a few surprises (a gorgeous bouillabaisse, pork chop in a pineapple port reduction)  *High-quality ingredients *Accommodating, friendly service  If I had to concoct a few criticisms (oh, such a stretch for me!), among them would be the noise level when the dining area is full, and perhaps a lack of innovation in the menu, especially in the Big Plates. That being said, if your standout is simple dishes, you'd better prepare them expertly.   And Local Bistro, largely, does.

TK's Urban Tavern may not be schmancy enough to be called a gastropub, but with its mix of semi-elcelctic brews and farm-fresh ingredients, it ranks several notches above a pub'n'grub.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich with apple slaw, havarti, and horseradish en baguette, fries, the BLT, fruit salad, and a side of ale battered onion rings with jalapeno aioli.   The pulled pork sammy was tasty and much lighter than its traditional BBQ-slathered siblings, though I wish the slaw had a little more oomph and apple tartness. Any BLT is a good BLT in my book, and TK's may even have a great one with its high quality ingredients and an added fried egg (I guess it should be a BELT then, and you might need to loosen yours after consumption). The onion rings were a thing of battered beauty, but the jalapeno aioli was a bit blah- I recommend kicking up the heat with some chile sauce or indulging in their flavorful homemade ketchup instead.   All this accompanied by TWO Samuel Smiths Ales. There didn't seem to be anything too out there on the beer list, but there are a lot of tasty standards like Guinness, Stella, trendy-again PBR, and a couple of local brews, too. Like the food, it's nothing fancy- but TK's isn't trying to be. It's just plain good.

Laidback atmosphere, excellent service, fun, fabulous food!  A friend and I sat at the bar and had a great time interacting with the bartender and another foodie patron at the bar. The wait staff seemd really knowledgeable with just the right attention to service.  I've enjoyed the Original Chopped Salad under a different moniker for years at Cowboy Ciao, so we decided to go with the Mirilton Chopped Salad: greens, tomato, popcorn, halloumi cheese, cucumbers and onions. The haloumi cheese was a unique treat, though overall it didn't really compare to the OCS.  We ordered the Pork Belly Pastrami starter, which was kind of a deconstructed reuben over spaetzle- it was almost perfect and the pork belly just melted in my mouth. The sea scallops were also heavenly, seared just so and served with buttery corn grits and a vinegary gastrique. We capped it all of with a pot de creme: super rich and just right for sharing.  We also enjoyed some red wine from Merkin (yes, THAT Merkin), the Maynard James Keenen winemaking venture- kind of neato, I haven't seen it in a restaurant before (watch "Blood into Wine" if you're lost).  I think this place has a little something for everyone, and for someone like me, it has it all. Its food is artful without being fussy, and the ambiance is cool without trying too hard.

1 more star awarded: Upper Crust, you've grown on me. Reading through my previous review, I still have all the same criticisms about the ambiance, but three return trips and I keep finding more and more reasons to like you.   * Excellent and attentive service, busy or slow * Michael David Petite Petit by the glass * Wine Wednesday: 1/2 off bottles * Great deals through social media * To-die-for yummy crust

Fairways Grille, as the name indicates, has a golf theme - one that remains consistent from Its decor and location to its menu of classic clubhouse fare.   Food offerings aren't surprising  (think basics like the Reuben, Cobb salad, burgers, and pasta) but judging from the packed dining room the menu is exactly what area retirees and players right off the links are craving. My club sandwich and sweet potato fries were simple and scrumptious. My only complaint is that they ran out of their "soon to be famous" onion rings; they smelled heavenly.  The interior felt a lot like "lunch at the club": lots of natural light, some unique dark wood accents, high tops in the bar area, and comfy swivel chairs and table seating in the main dining room. The golf-themed upholstery was a little cheesy for my taste, but what can I say? It fit with the theme.  The location is next to the golf course in the Rosati's strip mall, amid several retirement communities. And while I am neither a golfer nor a retiree, I do know a good sammie when I meet one. And for the area and clientele, Fairways Grille is right on par.

Windsor is brought to you by Upward Projects, the team of superhero masterminds behind the much loved Postino Winecafes. They sneak into our dreams at night and create restaurants inspired by our innermost wishes and dreamscapes of the perfect urban bistro.  At least that's what I thought when I walked into Windsor. "Damn, they nailed it again. I love this place. They have got to be infiltrating my head."  Comfortable but cool interior, great patio, large bar area for some neighborhood camaraderie and a little food voyeurism, and a zigzagged wall that says "YES!" in big red letters. Know what I say to that? You guessed it! It's YES, btw.  The bartender deserves a gold star for being totally attentive, soooo friendly, and a bonus glittery star for being too darn cute. Actually, all of the service staff were really, really nice. Gold stars for everyone!  The mixed grain salad was just one more reason I will be returning ASAP. I added smoked salmon and, holy moly! It was like 4th of July in my mouth with all the flavor explosions. I agree with some other reviews that a  couple of bites were a little overwhelmed by orange zest, but still loved the dish overall. Seafood ceviche was scrumptious, but not quite revelatory.  The guy next to me ordered a pork sandwich that looked out of this world. It also looked big enough to have it's own gravitational pull, and on second thought it probably did, because the entire bar area pivoted to stare, mouths agog. He said  "shish ish sho schmood", and that's a good enough endorsement for me. I'm coming back. And I want that sandwich.  Nice wine and beer list, and some very refreshing sounding cocktails with all manner of blueberry this and lemonade that.  Wake me up. I must be dreaming.

I had a wonderfully lazy day-drinking lunch on the patio here last Sunday. Just thinking about it has me licking my fingers and smacking my lips  in memory of juicy figs and triple cream brie bruschetta... nom nom nom nom... why can't every day be Sunday afternoon???  Timo's menu is a fantastic blend of shared dishes, flatbreads, and sandwiches, with brunch offerings on Sat/Sun. I can't wait to return and try the lamb chops, mussels ceviche, and foie gras with fig jam. Their wine and beer list? Don't get me started. It is fab-yoo-luss.   Fans of the former Bomberos will be pleased to see the interior is even snazzier with rich chocolate brown chairs and white leather banquettes- and a wood burning oven! The dog-friendly patio is mostly unchanged and just about perfect.   Intimate and casual-cool, Timo is an ideal spot for a date, catching up with friends, or enjoying an ale outside with the ol' laptop (they have wi-fi!). Notice 'a great place to bring children' didn't make the list. Just saying:)

Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19! Yay deal!  We enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread, with caramelized onions added. Scrumptious! We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce. The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies.   You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell, but you think it could really be something special? That's how I'm feeling about Timo. I hope it's love.

NO LIQUOR LICENSE YET! Really, nobody mentioned this? The place looks cute, the menu looks great, but we decided to leave and return when we can enjoy some sake with our sushi.   If cocktails are part of your night-out plan, I recommend calling ahead to see if they're serving.

A sleekish, low-lit  interior, an oddball mix of music (novelty country / top 40 pop / trance...?), and a menu with pictures; strangely, it works.  All of M's specialty sushi rolls have detailed descriptions and pics- handy for those crazy concoctions where the name 'Coo-coo Plaid Roll' isn't really illustrative. There's not really a 'Coo-coo Plaid Roll', I made that up, but you get the point.   We started with the 'M Roll', which is a bells and whistles, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink type of sushi roll with tempura shrimp, spicy mayo crab mix, eel sauce, cucumber, macadamia nuts, bonito flakes, and roe. The hubby wondered if they got a screaming deal on macadamia nuts, because they seemed to be on EVERYTHING.  The majority of the house rolls appear to be fried, baked, inside-out or upside-down, but there are plenty of classic rolls and sashimi for diners who prefer more traditional offerings. We ordered the sashimi sampler: red snapper, mackerel, tuna, and salmon. It was fresh and delicious. Request the fresh wasabi with your sashimi - its bright spicy bite is the perfect complement to raw fish.  We also tried the M Peppers, fresh jalapenos stuffed with crab meat (no 'k'!), and cream cheese. Haute cuisine? Methinks no, but they sure were tasty little scoundrels.  Prices were reasonable, and it looks like they regularly offer discounts through Groupon and Restaurant.com, so try a search before you go. I will definitely return to explore more of their specialty rolls and see what sashimi the chef has in store.
