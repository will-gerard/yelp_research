Love this place! The broth is unbelievable. The chicken pho is my favorite and their spring rolls are amazing!

I was so amped to try this place out, but my experience was disappointing. My friend and I ordered delivery. They advised it would be an hour, but I believe we got it in 45 minutes. The crab angels (rangoons) and potstickers were so delicious! The crab angels were creamy and full of flavor. They were, by far, the best I've ever tasted. The potstickers also had lots of flavor packed into each bite. If the meal ended there, I would be giving this place 5 stars. Then came the kung pao. Hmmm...isn't Kung Pao supposed to be spicy? It was breaded...which I've never experienced eating it that way before and it was sweet.  If it wasn't for the few peanuts thrown in there, I would say I got the wrong meal.  After three bites, I couldn't eat a sweet kung pao anymore. I decided to try out my friends orange peel chicken, but as he was looking through my cupboards for spices, I wasn't hopeful. After taking a bite, I agreed it was bland. Needless to say we didn't finish our plates. I guess next time I'll just stick to the appetizers...

I believe you should always give something a second chance, and I am so glad I decided to give Dragon Exrpress one!  I couldn't stop thinking about those perfect crab angels so I called up and ordered those creamy appetizers plus the kung pao again (Monica likes her chicken spicy).  I was crossing my fingers.  Turns out I must have gotten the wrong order last time I ate there.  This time the kung pao tasted like it was supposed to. It had some heat, not sweet. So I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I plan on ordering take out from them again.

I came to this spot about a month ago because I was trying to find a new place to get my nails done. I had been going to a nail salon at a mall and was always underwhelmed by the results. Let me tell you...I found my new place!! The place has a great atmosphere and isn't stuffy. Q was so friendly and easy going, I felt right at home. I had the basic pedicure and gel glitter manicure. Let me start by saying, I've never had a good pedicure. I can never get comfortable. But Q did such a great job! For the first time, I was completely relaxed and my feet felt terrific. The main highlight was getting the gel glitter manicure. The process took longer than most manicures but the end result was worth it. Wow! My nails popped with color and were so sparkly. It's been almost 4 weeks now and they still look like new which is amazing since I type like a mad woman at work. I would say the price is definitely a bargain based on the quality of work. And compliments? I have gotten so many compliments about my nails. Total strangers have come up to me just to ask where I got my nails done. That's definitely a sign of talent. Nails by Males will be the only place to go to from now on.

Anytime I enter this shop I want to buy the whole lot up! It's the first place I go to for work outfits. They offer fun, youthful, and still classy options that you can't find at other places. The prices are pretty affordable.  The shop itself is very relaxing and I feel very comfortable here.
