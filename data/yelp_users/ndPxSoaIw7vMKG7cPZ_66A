Great spicy Mexican food! I'm always looking for something other than standard options, and they have enough variety to keep it interesting. The jalapeno poppers are hand-breaded and stuffed with cream cheese, which is the best way to do it! They're closed on Sundays and have some weird hours, so I check yelp before wasting any more time driving up there only to be disappointed.

The sauce and bread are excellent. The calamari has light breading and tentacles--like it should. Don't go near closing because sometimes they close early.

Those are good burgers dude.  Listening to Creedence while enjoying these tasty burgers only enhances the flavor. Mind if I do a J?

I suspect many of these high ratings are coming from the high schoolers next door, in which case I'm sure it's an upgrade over the cafeteria. If you like a sub so soggy that the bun turns back into dough in your hands, then this is your place. The burger and dogs aren't impressive either. Unless you have a teenage gut of steel that can pass a tin can without flinching, there are better burgers to be had (habit or in n out), and better dogs too (Ted's).

Holy cow this might have been the best Cuban I've ever tasted, and I'm from Florida where Cuban restaurants are pretty common, so I've eaten many. I know it's lame to get a Cuban at a Puerto Rican restaurant, but I can't wait to go back and try one of the entrees.  This gem is tucked into a little strip mall (surprise!) and you can tell instantly it's a mom n pop joint. The lady working the counter was very friendly despite my wide-eyed gringo-ness. I will be back--soon!

The new location still has the quaint family feel. Good selection of interesting beers.  I went at lunch on a weekday and I was the only one there, so the service was great, but they also had no one else to take care of.  Even the chef came out of the kitchen and asked me how my meal was.  From previous visits to the old location I can say that the subs are interesting and delicious. Some of the combinations that sound odd are definitely more tasty than you'd expect. If you want to branch out and have your taste buds pleasantly surprised, check this place out!

Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer.

Excellent place to get your seafood fix in the desert. I went with the dungeness crab with corn and a potato, oysters, and cajun fries. First came the oysters, which were plump and fresh, much better than what you typically get in AZ for a similar price, e.g. Casey Moore's or Baja Joes.  Next were the cajun fries, which came out piping hot and crispy. I had to make an effort to stop eating them to save room for the main course.   The dungeness crab comes out whole, and will weigh more than 1lb, but my server kindly warned me of this and it wasn't a problem. When I opened the bag I looked like the crab was nibbling on my corn (see pic).  My only qualm came with the price of dungeness crab being $1.25 more per lb than on the menu. I understand re-printing all the inserts for the tables is annoying, but the price was even wrong on the marker-board. I couldn't care less about the extra couple bucks, and I would have ordered it at either price, it just comes off as a bit sloppy when prices don't match up. The food was too good to take a star off for that thought so I'm sticking with the 5 stars  This place is a great time and I will definitely be back. They were in the process of building a bar and I intend to use it!

There is a reason why this sandwich place has 5 stars. There are a ton of original sandwich creations to save you from submarine boredom. The bread is "par" baked (as in partially) and then finished baking to order so it comes out fresh and fabulous. There are a ton of vegetarian and vegan options if that floats your boat, and their website makes it easy to find them with their search filter. The staff was almost frighteningly friendly--not as intrusive as Dutch bros, but still oddly happy to see you, and chomping at the bit to walk you through the menu. During "happy hour" kettle chips and a drink are free if you eat in...it's not alcohol but it's a nice perk. It may come on the cheap to them because they have their own brand of soda pop instead of being slaves to Coca-Cola or appearing cheap with Pepsi, but their brand was sufficient to my taste buds. Don't feed the subway monster, check out Ike's--they really do love their sandwiches!

The Brass Tap just opened in Mesa Riverview right across from the theatre. They have 60 beers on tap and countless others by the bottle. The focus is American beers, but they have enough variety to satisfy even the avid beer snob.  I ordered the ham and cheese panini which comes with some amazing tangy honey mustard sauce that I would have bought by the bottle if it was possible. The bread was more like sandwich bread than a traditional panini...but really who cares. It tasted great, and this place is about the beer not the food.  The bartender was friendly and helpful, even as she politely fielded some drunk dudes hitting on her.  They have discount nights for first responders (mon), teachers (fri), restaurant workers (sun), and others. I will definitely be back.
