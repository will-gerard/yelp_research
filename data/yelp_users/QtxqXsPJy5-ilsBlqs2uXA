I was very sick with respiratory/sinus issues 2 months ago. I called into the office and was able to get in the same day. I was told this visit may take 2 hours to be seen by the doctor. I came in and was actually seen within 30 minutes. I was seen this day by Dr. Michelle Fulp. She has an excellent bedside manner. I told the nurse I normally pass out in a dr's office from anxieties. Dr. Fulp and the staff was very good at working with me through my anxieties. She worked with me so well even after my visit to make sure I started to feel better.  I also have kudos for Dr Mark Schlotterback whom my husband sees. He has always taken the time to answer all the questions I send in with my husband. He has a very good bedside manner. He spends as much time as Dan needs in order to have all of is concerns addressed. We went on vacation for the 4th of July last year when we realized my husband forgot his blood pressure meds. We called the after hours service and left a message. Dr. Schlotterback called us back within about 30 mins and had his RX called into the local pharmacy within an hour. When I went to the pharmacy to pick it up the RX we had another issue because my husband had just refilled this medication. We called back and again within 30 mins Dr. Schlotterback was on the phone with us and the pharmacy to get the situation resolved. If that isn't going above and beyond for your patient I don't know what is.  I have been extremely impressed with both of these medical professionals. They also have late hours and Saturday appointments available. I have referred several friends to the office and they have also come away loving the office.

Not impressed. We drove from mesa with our trailer to wash it. You can only use the automatic stall if attendent is available. You also have to hook any tongue pulled trailers.  So we proceeded to the self stall. There are wands for both sides of the vehicle however we couldn't get the one on the east side to work so we wasted$5.00 that the machine ate. The machine would accept the coins down to the last quarter then accept the money but not advance the payment. Thus we left with a half washed trailer so disgusted that we drove half an hour because this wash had a great review. We will not be returning.

We called Belsito Plumbing last night after hours.  The lady that answered the phone was very professional.  We were told it would be $40 to come out and give a quote on the job.  The tech Louis arrived within an hour.  He was professional and worked quickly to fix the problem. We had a leak in an old pipe on the side of the house. After thinking through the problem we decided it was best to work around the pipe instead of fixing that pipe.  The work was done and our bill was half of what other companies were quoting us over the phone.

I have been coming here for a long long time.  We had nicole tonight as a server.  Worst service ever!  Not only did she get my order wrong twice but she tried to come over ask me if my order was better than tried to show me on the menu how I was wrong.  When i showed her she was wrong she stomped off. Then came back to the table to fill water and did not fill mine but others mine was empty.  I'm not sure we will be returning anytime soon.  Sad cause I really love their Baja sauce.

Zona suites says it's a 3 1/2 star hotel.  This place was not up to par. We drove in and realized the guests were very ghetto.  Then we realize this place does not have an elevator and all the rooms doors go to the outside.  This is not a 3 1/2 hotel i was expecting.  We had to sign we would not smoke in rooms but the room smelt of musty smoke. Even the first floor had stairs. No security anywhere. There are signs all over the place that they do not take responsibility for theft or damage.  You could hear all your neighbors, walls are very thin.  We go down to pool and the spa is ice cold.  The pool is subpar at best.  We came to go back to our room from pool and was welcomed by a snake on the sidewalk.  The sheets were very cheap.  The kitchen was minimal stocked.  I will not be returning to this hotel. We paid way to much for this dump and that was on priceline!
