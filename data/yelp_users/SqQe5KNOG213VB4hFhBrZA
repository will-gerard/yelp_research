I agree with other reviewer's when it comes to this store.   I've come here primarily in the morning hour's, but I can assure you that it will not make much of a difference when people are determined to engage in mayhem that involves i.e. sexual harassment, aggressive panhandling and making you want to carry a crowbar in case the fur hits the ceiling.  The store inside is okay, but do you really thinking putting a Starbucks inside is going to make people forget about the insanity that goes on inside? That they'll ignore the lackluster service, the slightly inflated prices, and other nonsense going on?  I hate to say this,but dressing up a salt water crocodile in a Christian Dior dress won't change the fact you'll end up being decapitated.

This store is a little bit further away from where I live, but it's a major step ahead above the CVS stores that are in my area.  There is no shortage of snacks, cosmetics, and numerous other goodies. Did I mention the staff is friendly and the lines are rarely long?  There's also some type of minute clinic, but I've never had the need to utilize it. However, I've heard  a lot of positive feed back from my friends.

To be honest, I really don't come to Ulta very often due to the fact I purchase my beauty needs at other retailer's.  This location is okay, but in my opinion, it seems to have a small selection of products. However, I do like the fact that cosmetics aren't smeared all over the place unlike certain big box retailer's and the fact that they sell higher end cosmetics.  The sales associates are nice enough, but don't expect them to go out of their way except the bare minimum.

Jack in the box is NOT known for its cuisine or world renowned chefs. However, there are one or two items I have a strange liking for.  I walked in and was greeted by a young Latino kid working the counter.   After I placed my order I decided to use the bathroom and as I walked through the dining area I noticed several filthy tables and the area was in dire need of a good cleaning.  I walk into the bathroom and stepped in a large amount of water and the floor was covered with several mounds of soggy toilet paper.

This CVS location is located by several major hotels and has almost anything you need. The one caveat is that the prices are 30%- 40% higher, but it's to be expected in a tourist area.  There is an extensive selection of alcohol, snacks, souvenirs, and any personal care items you have forgotten to pack at home.   The lines can get pretty long, but the good thing is that you're not standing in line for an extensive period of time.

I frequent this store when I need a an emergency snack,tampons, or whatever I left at my house.  The store has almost everything you can imagine and then some.Prices are higher but you pay a premium in any tourist area.  The only downfall are the employees who assume carrying a backpack = shoplifter. I've also heard a manager instructing a cashier to watch an African American customer, because they don't purchase high end conditioner. Can we say bigotry and racial profiling?  I had to tell a lady to back off with her following me around and she quipped "I'm just doing my job!". Lady you need to take stalking lessons from Jodi Arias

I have been to this Albertson's on several occasions and to be frank, I'm not impressed in the slightest.   This store is below average in selection, prices, and service at the customer service window is an abomination.  I literally stood there for several minutes and  finally asked a cashier if anyone was available to help me because it was apparent that I would be standing there until 3000 a.d.   There are a lot of improvements that need to implemented, but I get the feeling that neither corporate or the management can be bothered with the tedious task of removing their heads from the sand.

This Von's is in dire need of being shut down and remodeled from the inside out. Located at the intersection of Maryland & Tropicana and less than ten minutes from the airport, strip, and two minutes from UNLV.  The shopping center has centered itself seems to be on it's last leg.Inside the store is dingy, dark, and generally unwelcoming.   The bakery/ deli section consists mainly of a few shelves of baked goods/ cold cuts with a limited selection.   If you need toiletry items be prepared to feel as if they're filming an episode of Lockup with the not so subtle gate at the end of the aisle to prevent you from running off with a bottle of Pantene conditioner or can of shaving gel  If you are a woman be prepared to be propositioned or if you're lucky like me, you might be the recipient of some random guy flashing his genitals to you. And let's not forget the guy who drives around the parking lot at 3 miles an hour tapping his horn and motioning you to get in the passenger seat of his 1984 Nissan pickup truck!  Or you will be approached at the RedBox kiosk by some random asking you if you are interested in some bootleg dvds

As long as I can remember I've always enjoyed reading and in my adult life the minute I arrive in a new city I always check out the local library.  Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix the library is spacious, modern, and well appointed.    There is no shortage of material that ranges from popular fiction,learning materials,dvds,and college depot that offers information for those looking to earn their high school diploma/ Ged.  The staff is more than happy to help patrons who require assistance.

I am no stranger to Ikea because I've shopped at their Mission Valley location which is located in San Diego.  I like being able to walk all throughout the store and gaze at all the furniture, knick knacks,  numerous other items.    I know people like to say that their furniture here is 'cheap' but there's a difference between cheap and downright tacky which Ikea is NOT.    It's what I call starter furniture geared towards the younger crowd.  I've always found anything I've purchased here to be durable, good quality, and easy to take care of. And did I mention you won't get raked over the coals when you purchase a trash can? Imagine that!   Sorry, I refuse to pay $20 for a waste basket at other big box stores.  And if you want to destroy your waistline, they have a cafe where you can gorge yourself on meatballs, pizza, and $1 cinnamon rolls! Score!

I honestly think that I was too generous with my first review   I honestly feel bad for the cashiers who have to deal with panhandlers, drunks,and other weirdos in the area.   Basically, it's the the evil twin of the Cityscape location version 4.0 . I witnessed an employee telling a guy "you need to take the batteries out of your pocket. You're a thief and you need to leave".   The selection is dismal and I'm often having to go to other stores to find what I am needing. Store needs a good overhauling, but I don't know if it's gonna happen

This is where you come when you're not in the mood for fast food, frozen pizza from Vons, or would prefer not to drive across town for tasty Vietnamese food.    Now allow me to say that I am no expert on Vietnamese food, but I will say is that I'm pretty confident when I say that this is a quality establishment.   I stopped by here on the eve of Thanksgiving and was seated immediately. After perusing the menu V decided to order to order Com chien thap can fried  rice with Vietnamese ham and Chinese sausages along with fried fish balls as my appetizer.  My meal was more than adequate and quite tasty to boot! My total bill before the gratuity was around $14.00

This store is a bit on the grimy side with a parking lot full character trying to solicit money from customers.  Inside the store is relatively clean, well stocked, and has the basics.   The prices can be a little steep depending on what you want, but if you keep an eye on their ads, you can find some good deals.  However, some of the employee's seem that they would rather be somewhere else, but it would be nice if they weren't so obvious!  I know you guys can do better than this!

Being a long-time shopper of Big Lots I tend to know what to expect.  I walked in the store and noticed that it is a good size, however I noticed this store seems to be a little on the neglected side.   I also noticed that a lot of merchandise was strewn across the aisles and clearly not in their appropriate departments. And some areas seemed to be on the barren/ picked over and the employees were mainly hanging around up the front area.  I honestly am unsure if I would patronize this location in the near future.

I typically favor Latin markets due to their more reasonable prices on produce & meat and they also carry a lot of the goodies I grew up on as a kid.   Now I am going to warn you and say that this is a market in not so classy part of town so if this bothers you then go elsewhere.  The market is clean, seems to be well stocked, and has all the essentials for a Latino household with the exceptions of a few items .  Fyi : there's an awesome roach coach parked outside that serves mariscos and seems to specialize in shrimp aka camaron

Ugh, this store is on the skeevy side-especially in the morning when chances are you'll be propositioned  for drugs, jewelry for sale, or who  knows what else.  The good thing is that they have coffee, energy drinks, and a laundry mat next door.    FYI: ladies keep a can of mace in case somebody gets to learn cause the fur really hits the fan with this crowd

Located right next to Ellis Island this location can get pretty busy, especially when people have just left the local nightclubs or going to and from whatever location.  You'll see your share on panhandlers, limo drivers, and other garden variety characters. So, I would exercise some common sense just to be on the safe side.  The store is the typical 7-11 stocked with chips,sodas,and other essential goodies in order to help you get through the day.Employees are friendly and will get you out the door in a flash

This store is one of my frequent places to grab protein supplements, hygiene products, and whatever else catches my eye.  The only drawback here is the number of panhandler's/ wantaprenuer's peddling mixtapes, knock off cologne,and of course pushing a stroller that happens to have a cooler loaded with snacks for sale.

Colorful characters are abundant in this part of town, but it's really not that bad in comparison to downtown Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and San Diego.    The store is relatively clean and has an assortment of junk food available.   Service is okay at best, but I don't know how cheerful I'd be if I were in their shoes

Okay, what's so great about a park right in the middle of downtown Phoenix? I mean after all this city is not as rich in culture or sophistication in comparison to Los Angeles,San Francisco, and countless other cities.  It offers me a place to sit down and unwind my brain, which is I end up needing after running errands or just dealing with everyday life.  Perfect for me !

This is where I go when I'm in need of cleaning supplies, cheap snacks, and other necessities.   Although, I would advise against purchasing certain items at a store like this. And please be careful in this area because an old lady had her purse taken in this store when she had her back turned! (Jerks are everywhere!)  I like the fact that this store is clean, uncluttered, and has a good selection of merchandise. Just make sure to check the expiration date and avoid a majority of the produce because some it seems to look as if it's overripe or close to rotting.

You know I Walgreen's I do like you, but there are a few kink's that need to be worked out. For instance with the points program that says "spend 25 dollars on this product and receive 5,000 points".   Ok, great, but the issue is that on several occasions the label is vague, i.e. it doesn't say what particular participating products which can be confusing and annoying.   How hard is it to say you must purchase face wash, lipstick, or whatever the case may be? It's annoying and could be easily remedied but the likelihood seems rather slim?  Second, this location is often littered with questionable character's soliciting money or whatever they think they can get away with.   And if you are filling prescriptions here don't bother because the pharmacy is often filled to the gills with ornery customers.  The employee's typically have an "I'm over this circus" attitude because chances are they're expected to do the work of 50 people and the numerous challenges at this location.    However, this is retail and when you are this close to the strip you should know what to expect -unless you are a country bumpkin fresh off the Greyhound bus and have only lived here a few weeks.

The Las Vegas strip is NOT the place for those who are easily offended, lack any kind of self control (why do you think they make so much money?), or lack the ability to see through the smoke & mirrors  .Remember kids you're NOT here for a bible study, ethics & morals class, and you certainly aren't here for an economics class unless it's a hands on class that teaches you how to rake people over the coals.  You'll see the rich, the poor, luxury, and everything in between. Bargains are far and few between, but it's all relative when you are in a tourist area.   There is always some kind of hustle going on ranging from street gambling schemes, pan handlers, tawdry advertisements for escort services, strip clubs, bars, etc..   Take it for what it is and don't be that pissed off tourist throwing a temper tantrum on the sidewalk.

I'll be the first to say that I'm more of a tomboy and I don't do accessorize or have 200 purses.  However, there are going to be occasions that call for you to look  like an adult and a purse from Target/Walmart/swap meet simply aren't going to get the job done.  Everything here is fashion forward without coming off as juvenile /tacky which is nice, especially when one wants to look pulled together. The prices are affordable and definitely within reach.  I'm definitely coming back in the near future

really enjoy coming to Ellis Island because  of the affordable steak &eggs special and it's tasty to boot! Now mind you the steak here hasn't been aged for 6 year's in some type of sophisticated refrigerator nor are the cows given special diets or whatever.  Today, I came in to grab a late breakfast and paid a higher price 10.99 which didn't bother me, but I found that my server wasn't really on top of her game due to it being somewhat crowded but I tried to overlook it.  What bothered me is when I was given my check and I was informed that I would be paying her which is what I expected. I was sitting on my phone waiting for her to come back for at least ten minutes and I was going to leave her a 3 dollar tip in spite of the lackluster service ( tip would have been better, but I decided to leave a dollar instead as I decided to get up and pay the front instead. I ALMOST never tip so poorly and I am often chastised by my friends for being too generous, but frankly I was at the end of my rope.

Factory 2 u is a store that carries clothing that is geared towards those on a budget.   This is where I come for cheap socks, tank tops, other miscellaneous items. I just can't fathom the idea of paying a hefty price for socks or pajama bottoms. Nope, not on my watch  The only thing that bothers me is that the store is can be messy, but I guess that comes with the territory of retail

I myself believe that sometimes you should spend a little more money on certain beauty items-especially when it concerns your skin.   I have seen this brand all over the internet and finally decided to take the plunge.     I've always found that this brand has a color selection that is far superior to their competition who only make five to six shades.  I've always found the staff here to helpful,informative,and quite talented. Many thanks!

There's an old quote that goes "The best laid plans". Um, yeah that was me last night thinking I was going to simply cruise in and cash my paycheck!   Ha! That was until the cashier told me about their lip smacking prime rib.  So, I decided that I wanted a decent meal and went upstairs. Upon arriving, I was seated in less than five minutes and Ki my server took my order.  The king cut prime rib comes with two sides and I decided upon a salad & mashed potatoes that also came with dinner rolls. The salad itself was fresh and was lacking in the wilted greens department   My entree was ordered medium rare because I hate overcooked meat that is impossible to eat.And let me say that this portion was well worth the money because I was unable to eat it and I've got the appetite of a Great Dane  My $18 dollar meal was worth every penny and my server earned her six dollar tip.

Yes, I have a fondness for the supermarket's that cater to the Latino population and sells pan dulce, Jesus candles, and if you're lucky you might find a lady selling Avon or Jafra beauty products.  This store has pretty much anything you want, whether it's fruit, meat, spices, and pretty much anything you'll need to cook Mexican food. Did I mention the prices on the produce are significantly better than their competition  The employee's have are happy to help you with whatever questions that you may have.

I am going to write an update concerning a product I purchased at the Dollar tree.   My skin was itching very badly in spite of me using my favorite lotion Eucerin and I decided to purchase a body wash that would help me, but the problem is Aveeno doesn't sell bar soap and if they do I wasn't able to find it at the Target next door. Nor was I willing to pay seven dollars for a wash I have planned to only use for a few days.  I stopped here to grab a quick snack and do some snooping around. I came here and happened to see some type 'oatmeal' wash and I figured that it couldn't hurt since I've never had issues in the past, but man was I in a major kick the pants.   The next morning I woke up with huge puffy eyes that were caused by the residue getting onto my face and I had hives on my ears which my doctor confirmed.   And I had a huge hive directly under my left eye, which looked like a massive white head on steroids and that required I take antibiotics in order for it to go down. I also had hives on my legs that were painful due to inflammation.   Please be careful kids!

I stopped in to check out their selection of shoes and possibly make a purchase. When you walk in you will see numerous rows of shoes organized by gender, style, and age group.        As I was walking around not once was I acknowledged or offered any kind of help even though I had a pretty good idea of what I was looking. As I walked through the store, I could obviously hear the girls chatting about subjects that evidently had nothing to do with work, and once again they said nothing even though I was one of only 3-4 customers at the store.         Frankly, Sketchers seems to be a more fashion forward brand that is geared to older teens and women in their early twenties. Customer service is something that is clearly in need of some fine tuning.

Dutch Brother's are a friendly, upbeat, and positive alternative to its rivals in the immediate area.  The annilator  is smooth, rich, and a breath of fresh air when you need it most.   The girls at the counter will gladly answer any questions you may have and will assist you in making the right choice.
