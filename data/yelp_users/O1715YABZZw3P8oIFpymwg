Summary for phone Yelpers and the TLDR crowd: Best pizza in the area / best food in its price range in the area. There is no fault to be found with their two slices special. My favorite trio of toppings is meatball, onion, and basil. This brings you to about $5.00. The pizza slices are very large and crunch when you bite into them.  This review centers around the two slices deal.  Situation: I work at 44th St. and Thomas and am always looking for great food on the cheap.  Getting there: If you're coming from the east on Indian School, turn left at 40th St as opposed to turning into the parking lot closer to Bally's. If you're coming southeast from Indian School, take 40th St. and turn left when you see the drive through liquor joint.  Parking: It's a tight parking lot. If you're in a larger vehicle it would be best to park a little nearer to the check cashing place.  Menu: If you're going for the two slices deal, pick up one of the paper menus as some of the available toppings aren't featured on the big menu above the counter.  Ordering: The only thing to note about ordering is that they will not let you order the two slices deal in advance. This probably doesn't concern 98% of the population but is a bummer when you're meeting up with someone with limited time or want something on the run. The pizza will take between 5 - 10 minutes. They give you a small cup. China mist iced tea was added within the last six months which was nice since I try to avoid soda whenever I'm already wrecking shop on my health with the pizza.  Service: Your order will be brought to you whether you sit inside or out. The inside is a lot more comfortable since the table that cramped the interior was removed. There are misters outside.  The food: The pizza is a real treat. The slices are slightly smaller than Sbarro (just a point of reference, put the flamethrowers away) but the pizza is completely different. Where a slice of NY style pizza can be folded and needs support from a second hand, Mamma Mia's remains stiff with its thin crust. Is this New Jersey style pizza? I have no idea.  I haven't had a bad set of slices here. The quality is consistent though I have had some jalapenos that weren't all the way baked leaving them way to spicy for me and my ham and pineapple mix.  The only other item I've had here is the stuffed meat supreme which, from the website, is "pizza crust on top and bottom stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, ham, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce." If you've been minding some tofu diet for a month and deserve a caloric overdose; or are trying to commit suicide in a delicious way, it's a great choice.  Grated Parmesan, crushed red peppers, garlic powder, and oregano are available in shakers.   Conclusion: For being dough, sauce, and cheese, Mamma Mia really do something amazing here. This is a restaurant that I'm excited to take anyone to who hasn't yet been. If you haven't been... what are you waiting for? Look at the volume of reviews!

Summary: Without claiming to be the Arizona's foremost expert on Indian cuisine or, in fact, even knowing what the hell I'm talking about; this is my favorite Indian food restaurant. The rice is never sticky, the naan is always perfectly toasted and sacrilegiously tossing chicken tikka masala atop the two of 'em completes an excellent naan taco. This review is pretty much giving that combination of items along with the chicken tikka wrap 5 stars. I certainly can't vouch for the whole menu.  Pricing: The $6.95(?) chicken tikka wrap on the lunch menu is delicious. Lunch service is prompt. Dinner prices and portions are average. Indian food seems to always be in the $$ range minimum.  Concerns: If you're thinking about coming here on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to consider calling ahead to find out if you're going to be subjected to Shiva's meal tarnishing minions, the belly dancers, along with the accompanying 100dB Indian techno soundtrack. It only happened to me once and, thank Vishnu, I was signing the bill at the time.

A friend and I agreed to get certified and that was that. Previous to signing up for this beginner's course, I'd never thought at all about scuba diving and had zero opinion of the sport. I had done something similar with a motorcycle license about two years ago and haven't done so much as sit on a motorcycle since. Would this pursuit end as nothing more than another dusty license achieved on my quest to become a poor man's James Bond? Or even worse... James Bond Jr.?   The following is not to be used for inspiration. We visited the shop and Gary gave us our PADI study guide/workbook and dive calculator and told us it was important that we complete the guide previous to starting class on September 4th. We had two months. Cut to September 3rd, we're removing the cellophane from the guide in the car driving home from a music festival in LA with hangovers. We complete 3 chapters. Pathetic.  The class structure is as such: Week 1, Tuesday: classroom session 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM. (chapters 1-3!!) Week 1, Thursday: classroom session 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM. Week 1, Saturday: pool session 1:00 - 5:00 PM. Week 1, Sunday: pool session 1:00 - 5:00 PM. Week 2, Saturday: Lake Pleasant open water: 1:00 - 5:00 PM. Week 2, Sunday: Lake Pleasant open water: 1:00 - 5:00 PM.  The classroom sessions were taught by Gary in a way that was not boring. That said, it IS a classroom environment so come alert. Whenever I would start for my phone or a daydream, I found reminding myself that stupidity underwater could kill me was a pretty good way to return to attentiveness. Be prepared to spend around $250-$350 on gear. Fins, boots, mask and snorkel are a requisite primer for getting you in the water.   ...and in the water is where Gary and Edward really shine. Here the 8-10 of us were in the somewhat daunting task of learning a completely new and foreign skill set and feeling pretty good about it. I never felt unclear on what skill we were to be demonstrating. Gary and Edward would describe and demonstrate the skill above water and then perform it underwater. We would follow suit one by one and then head to the surface for constructive criticisms. The two pool days were like this and the two Lake Pleasant days somewhat mimic the pool days but in the much deeper open water setting.  I thought being underwater was so awesome that even dumpy Lake Pleasant (complete with 6' visibility and nothing to see but the occasional rusty can previously home to some shitty American lager) was a blast.  On Sunday, 9/16/2012, we completed the Open Water certification with Scuba Magic. My concerns of repeating the motorcycle experience were laid to rest and I'm happy to report that I'm looking into my first real dive trip ASAP.

Summary for phone Yelpers and the TLDR crowd: This place is fast and shitty. They can't speak English or cook. Avoid even in the most dire situations involving hunger. Possibly a good place to score drugs.   This review centers around the carne asada burrito. This burrito should only be used to play a cruel joke on the homeless as it looks like a wealth of food but it's really a mirage wrapped in a flour tortilla.  Alternate food recommendation would be the Jack in the Box a half mile north.  Situation: I had twenty minutes to rush from the second floor of Gateway Community College to my car and haul ass anywhere with food.   Getting there: My first mistake was opting to go west on Van Buren. In the same way a gas station never exists when you need fuel or a grocery store is nowhere to be found when you need milk in a new area; there is nothing. That is, until you see La Salsita on the south side just past one of twenty used car dealerships pockmarking the road fabled for its prostitution. Two miles was more of a trip than I wanted but I was happy to finally see a restaurant.  Parking: If you're not going to heed the advice that follows in this review and you do choose to suffer through La Salsita yourself, make sure you attempt to enter AFTER the actual restaurant. Yes, the used car dealership does have the same color scheme but, no, you cannot park there. I assure you that parking will never be an issue lest La Salsita begins joining its neighbors in car sales.  Entering: Walk past the walk-up order window that is curiously placed in a roadblock creating manner on the walkway in the event anyone is actually ordering there. Continue past the door that remains locked and has benches in front of it on the inside. Do enter through the door that leads you into a deserted Arizona room dining area which will then lead you to to the real entrance. Complete disarray.  To your left, you will notice a salsa bar that features some tomatillo based sauce, a red sauce, some green muck, a pot of frijoles; and a bin of radishes and carrots which served to confuse this gringo.   Menu: Standard x-berto's fare  The menu is rife with pictures. A rule many havens of cheap food seem to follow is to have plenty of pictures that look even worse than what you're about to receive. Whether or not this is due to the lacking abilities of a novice photographer friend or to prepare you for the worst is unknown.  While you order at a counter parallel to the entrance, the menu is above that salsa bar on the left. It's counterintuitive but it will afford you an opportunity to do those oft neglected neck stretches left to forward.  Ordering: I was being stared at by the seemingly nice woman behind the counter which caused me to precariously decide on the carne asada. She didn't speak English and my Spanish basics weren't helping me. Through pointing, shrugging, and head shaking the order came to an appropriate amount which signaled I didn't accidentally order a side of flautas for 40 or a used Hyundai.  Service: The language barrier was rough but unsurprising. Since the woman didn't attempt to pull anyone else up to the front, I'm assuming I was the lone English speaker.   About a minute and a half into the wait, out came my carne asada. Very fast!  The food: Living up to the picture was a good looking handmade tortilla tightly wrapped. There was so much meat that, should it be any good, buying one of these burritos to take home to use as an ingredient would be feasible. On the side of the plate was a child's handful of shredded lettuce with a squirt of deflated sour cream on the top of it.  I took one bite of the carne asada and couldn't believe how terribly dry and tasteless it was. There was no seasoning, no flavor, no freshness. This was meat that was cooked much earlier and sat under a lamp for hours. Acknowledging I was now only eating to satiate hunger and not to enjoy myself, I doused the thing in as much red sauce as the tortilla could handle and topped it off with the lettuce. One third was about all I could take. I thought about asking whether or not the frijoles were free since they were with the rest of the salsa bar but didn't see any point. If I got sick later, I knew I had a sole item to blame instead of two possible candidates. I chucked the rest of it and took off.  Conclusion: I'm not above any of the many x-berto's. From the mid-tier cheap-o Mexican food of Filiberto's to the five star cheapness of Carolina's and Carumba's: I love Mexican food. This is why I hated La Salsita.  I'm all about giving even a perceived shithole  a fair shake so I will return and play it safe with a combo plate.
