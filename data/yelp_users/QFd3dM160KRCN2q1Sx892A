Do not take your animals here! My family has been going to this vet for over 25 years and have watched as they started to care less about the animals and more about the money. We took our cat there a few months ago and they gave us terrible advise. They only offered very expensive treatments without even diagnosing what was wrong with him. They sent him home with fluids and he died the next day because he was in too bad of shape 24 hours later. Negligence!!!!! We paid TWO THOUSAND dollars for surgery on our Boxers leg with a payment plan. We only owe $120 now and due to my Husband and I losing our jobs we cannot afford to pay off what little we do owe. They turned us into collections knowing the circumstances. When she had the surgery done, the Dr. told us she would have to be on medication FOR LIFE. When the refill ran out this week my pharmacy called it in. They have REFUSED to refill her life long prescription they said without her being seen first. I told them we do not have the money to take her in at the moment and she says "Sorry. Have her seen at her regular vet to get a refill." YOU ARE THE REGULAR VET! At least they were until they refused her service and meds today. THIS is what we get for being loyal to this vet for so many years. Thank you Arrow for only caring about money! Thank you for killing my cat and letting my dog go through pain for no reason. You are disgusting. I will run Arrow animal hospitals name through the mud! No more referrals for you. You have just lost four families business! Congrats!

The manager here (possibly owner) is a complete asshole. The bread wasn't cooked and was gooey all wet and he refused to re-make the sandwiches. He's a real cheap bastard. The workers seemed to be in good spirits; I have no idea why seeing who they work for. I wouldn't return to this location if you paid me!

My Husband and I decided to give this place a try tonight and take my parents along with us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pork was great, the brisket was perfect (and not fatty!), the waffle fries were tasty and the mac and cheese was awesome and those who ordered them, liked the beans. My Husband liked his Midwest Monster and tore that sandwich up! Even the kid ate the pork slider and we can't get him to eat much of anything these days! Needless to say, we will definitely be coming back for more! The only thing I thought they could improve on are the buns. They were cold, not very tasty or toasted.

Went here on a field trip with my son's class this last week. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and great with the kids. The kids all had a great time! We have been here several times with the family and soccer teams and have never had any complaints. It is always clean, (I don't think it smells bad!) and they have made some nice changes since we were last there. They've also added several snack bar options. All in all we have never had a complaint coming here aside from their yogurt station they have since gotten rid bahmoojbc3of. We will be returning again and again!
