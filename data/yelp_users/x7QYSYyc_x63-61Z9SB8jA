I love this Pizza place!!!!!I had the white pizza and it is amazing!!!The only set back is its kinda pricey compared to other pizza joints but it is worth it for the quality of the pizza!!!

I come I this location a lot. I like that it's so close, but I hate that it gets so crowded on the weekend. Can't complain about that though since it is in a prime location. They always keep the salad bar nice and clean! The bus staff is always on top of cleaning stuff off of the tables,sometimes they even refill your drink. My only complaint is that it's so expensive! $27 for 2 people for dinner with drinks and that's with 15% off! That won't keep us away though.

It is what it is here at this pool hall/dart throwing/poker playing bar.the food is worse then chillies, and the place definitely needs to be cleaned!!but they have cheap beer and fun poker where if its busy you can win $40 or $ off your bar tab.tip try the brownies or rice crispy treats at the bar that the owner makes!!

I just recently stopped in with a group of 9 people on sat night and we didn't have to wait at all for 2 booths in the cantina. Stevie was our server and she was very nice and patient as well as efficient. I love servers that can take an order in there head without writing anything down. My girlfriend and I split the fundido which was amazing! We will have to come back for the happy hour which looks awesome!

I have been here 2 times, the first time it took the waitress/bartender around 10 mins to greet us. They were not busy at all. The 2nd time my friends and I showed up sat at 11am and we were one of the first ones in there. Once again the service was really bad and it took over 45 mins for our lunch to come out! She said the kitchen kept messing up my friends meal that's what took so long so she comped his meal but not ours???we had to wait to!!!overall the food is okay the service is bad!

Came in for a $6.99 full service wash and checked out with a $59.99 interior detail and an ultimate wash...the glass guy quoted me a fair price on a new windshield since I have a crack across the whole thing...not bad like this place...just say no if u don't want any add ons to the wash....actually after a couple days i realized they forgot to put my floor mats back in.When i went to pick them up they looked worse then before the detail.Also the stain did not come out as the guy said it would..not going back!!!

My co worker and I came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was bad!!!!! It's not a big role to begin with and they only had 2 servers. It was really bad service!!!! I had the special which that day was the hot ham and cheese with bacon and fries. My meal was very plain nothing to write home about. Definitely will not be going back here. Bad service is the worst at restaurants!

Stopped in for breakfast during work and I loved it!! I think this May be family Owned which is always a plus! I love to support local businesses instead of billion dollar corporations. I got the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes which were amazing!!i should have took a pic as the presentation was also great! The servers were nice and very fast. Next time I want to try the cinnamon roll(looks like a Cinnabon but better) that you can substitute instead of toast for a dollar! Will be back!!!

Awesome Japanese steakhouse!!!better then Benihana! Eric was our  teppananki chef and was amazing!so happy I live so close to here! Hope this place succeeds. The only negative about it is the server was kinda slow but nothing crazy. See you guys next week!

This was my first time at potbelly,and I loved it!! The ordering system kind of reminds me of Quiznos, but the sandwiches are way better. I also ordered a pickle which I thought would be a little spear but turned out to be the biggest pickle ever!! So good! I love that they list the calories in everything. I definitely will be back!

Tried this place out on the 4th of July. Should have read the reviews before I went there. It took 20 mins for a server to come to our table on a sat night!(it wasn't that busy)when we did finally order drinks our server said there were no specials,even though on the Facebook page it said american girl drinks were $5. Of course when the bill came we were charged $8 for them. I showed the waitress and said she would let the manager know. She took one off, so that was good. The thing that saved them was Laura Walsh. She was the singer that night and she killed it!

Great location next to the mall has reclining seats but I think the seats at amc esplanade in the Biltmore is better.this theatre is cheaper though!like others have said when people walk down the stairs in the theatre it is loud...other then that great movie going experience and they have the soda machines with over 100 options(3 of them)
