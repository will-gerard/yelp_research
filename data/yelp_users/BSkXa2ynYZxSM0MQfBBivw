I emailed this establishment about our experience. I expected a response at the very least an apology.  A week later and clearly they must have enough customers and dont need any new ones.  We wont try them again, not because of the lack luster experience but because the couldn't be bothered to acknowledge a  customer that did the right thing and tried to Let them know what is happening in their restaurant.

Store is always dirty, I understand they are busy but their employees just dont care. Especially Kaitlyn she is extreamly rude and it was unnecessary. Unfortunately not many places to go in this area.
