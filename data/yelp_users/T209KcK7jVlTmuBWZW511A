Really not that impressed by Canyon Cafe. My work recently moved downtown to our corporate headquarters building, so I am trying out all kinds of new restaurants in the area. Sadly, Canyon Cafe just doesn't cut it. I ordered the carnitas plate which came with meat, fajita veggies, rice, beans and tortillas. The meat was tender but bland, the fajita veggies were not cooked thoroughly (I expect fajitas veggies to be crispy and fresh off the grill), the rice was mediocre. The beans and tortillas were the best part of the plate. My coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars.  The best part of my meal was the white chocolate nut dessert that comes with your check. It's wrapped up in a corn husk and looks as good as it tastes!  One highlight: free dessert if you check in on Yelp! I got the chocolate cake to go. It was super rich and basically a huge block of fudge. The crust was tasty but I hardly ate any of the cake itself.  4 stars for service and convenience, 2 stars for food, 2 stars for dessert (even though it was free). I probably won't be back.

Came here to get a Zagg glass phone cover installed on my iPhone. The whole experience took 45 minutes - far too long to be at a Best Buy. I asked an employee for help; he sent me to the Geek Squad. How many geeks does it take to install a phone cover? 6, I think.   The cover cost $40 and they insisted on charging $8 to install. I've been to Best Buy before and purchased the exact same glass cover in the past, and never once have I paid an install fee. Scam artists!! I contested the charge but they wouldn't budge. They said it's to "make up for the costs when they install the covers incorrectly." Lo and behold, the first cover they tried to put on was "defective" (allegedly) and we needed a second one. The second one they installed had a bubble underneath. The lady at Geek Squad said it should go away within a day or two. If it doesn't, come back and they'll install a third cover. That'll be another wasted 45 minutes... No thanks.   Skip an in-store visit and buy whatever you need online. 0 stars for service. Try not to come here.

Order the Bobbie - you won't regret it!!!! Tastes like Thanksgiving on a sandwich. I love going to Capriotti's for lunch. This location is close to my work so I call it in and go pick it up. Always fresh, very flavorful, high quality food. My favorite is the Bobbie sandwich but their cheesesteak is also tasty - don't forget to add sweet peppers!

WELCOME TO ASIA!!! Ok, not really, but the moment you step inside Lee Lee Market, you'll feel like you've been transported to a different part of the world. This place is my go-to spot when I'm shopping for ingredients to make an Asian meal. They are slightly unorganized, but every aisle is packed full of unfamiliar goodies. Granted, some of it I will never buy (pig heads, chicken feet, live catfish, and what is that crazy looking fruit!?!) but you are guaranteed to come across something new every visit. Definitely worth an hour or two of your life to wander through the store!   If you're looking for a specific item, call ahead or go straight to an employee for help. While items are grouped together by type (cookies, fruit, noodles, spices), not everything is organized logically. Sometimes you'll find foods stored together by country (Vietnamese foods, Thai foods, etc), but certain ingredients will be in another part of the store. Ask for help if you're unsure. Large selection of beer and booze that is reasonably priced. Produce is always fresh and you'll find a much larger variety than an American supermarket. If you eat a lot of rice, buy in bulk (giant bags are right by the entrance).    They have a jewelry store inside the supermarket, but I've never purchased anything there. One section of Lee Lee Market has trinkets, home decor, and traditional oriental items that you can give as gifts. They sell bamboo arrangements, as well as individual (living) bamboo stalks if you want to make your own. Another area of the store carries mobile phones, international calling cards, and other electronics. You can also purchase cooking tools, cutlery, and dishes.

I am a few days post-op from my LASIK surgery, and so far so good! As time passes, I will update my review if any issues arise. After wearing contacts/glasses for the majority of my life, I now have 20/15 vision! :) LASIK is a scary procedure and I hated it, but I would absolutely recommend it! Dr. Schwartz and his team did an excellent job and made the procedure as painless as possible.   I had my preliminary exam to determine eligibility for the procedure on Thursday. This exam took about 2 hours and I had a variety of tests on different machines. My technician/nurse Annie was great - very sweet and funny. She explained every test and answered all of my questions. She kept me at ease throughout the whole eye exam. After Annie and I did the tests, I met with Dr. Rhodes to review everything. She is an optometrist and highly professional. I was only with Dr. Rhodes for a few minutes before Dr. Schwartz came in to review my exam results. Dr. Schwartz said I was a great candidate for LASIK, and recommended I go the "custom" route because I have large pupils. Most expensive option, but this type of procedure is not something you want to skimp on. If the doctor says go custom, then pay the extra money to do it right! Although I only had about 5 minutes with Dr. Schwartz, I felt very confident in his abilities and I had no worries moving forward with the LASIK procedure. On my way out of the office, I met with another nice office lady to go over the price of the surgery ($4,400) and discuss financing. I paid some of it out of pocket, and then used their $0 interest financing for the remaining balance. On Thursday, I was at their office for 3 hours total.   We scheduled my surgery for the next day, Friday at 10am. When I came into the office for the surgery, I had to repeat a few of the eye tests from the previous day. They explained that this is simply cautionary as they want to ensure they have accurate information before starting the surgery. Sounds good - better safe than sorry! Then, they took me to the surgery waiting room. I got a hairnet, started using my antibiotic eye drops, and waited for my turn. About 10 minutes before the procedure, the nurse gave me a Valium to calm my nerves and keep anxiety at bay during the LASIK surgery. Then, it was time for the lasers!   To anyone who says LASIK is no big deal, you're a liar. It was terrifying! I hated it! The surgery only took 5 minutes but it felt like forever. They start by suctioning your eyes to keep your eyelids open. Then they use lasers to create flaps in your eyes so they can access the cornea. Your vision goes black during this process. Next, they put you under a different laser to actually make changes to your vision. "Stare at the light" they say... Zap zap zap... Then, you're done! Yes, it was quick and relatively painless, but the suctioning of my eyes felt uncomfortable and the lasering part of it was scary!!! Yes, Dr. Schwartz is great. Yes, his staff is great. Yes, I can see perfectly. Yes, I would recommend it! But, I still stand by my statement that it was terrifying and I hated it. From start to finish, I was at their office for about 2.5 hours.   My boyfriend picked me up (you can't drive immediately after the surgery) and took me home. I did my antibiotic and steroid eyedrops as directed and slept for 6 hours. When I woke up, I could see! It's a miracle!!!! My eyes felt super dry and scratchy, but my vision was clear!   The next day, Saturday, I went in for my one day post-op check up. I saw Dr. Rhodes again who said my vision is at 20/15 (woohoo!) and everything looked good! They gave me $25 coupon to purchase a pair of polarized sunglasses so I picked out a pair of fancy Oakleys. Polarized sunglasses are a must post-surgery as they protect your new wonderful eyesight from damaging UV rays. I scheduled my one week post-op check up for Friday. After that, providing no complications, I'll be back in three months (and again in a year) for another check up.

For several years, I was an occasional client of Cobblestone until my last experience. I do not plan on returning again.  I made an appointment for a manicure on Halloween, at 630pm. I was going to a family wedding the next day in Texas and I really wanted to get my nails done before I left. When I called to make the appointment, I asked if they'd still be open that late considering that it was Halloween. The girl on the phone said yes and I made the appointment.   I arrived at Cobblestone at 620pm. The whole place was empty and dark, but I could see someone still in the building. I went inside and spoke to Eileen who told me they were closed. I let her know I made an appointment and she went to check her book. She found my name but still said that they were closed. She said that she wanted to call me earlier that day to let me know they were closing early due to Halloween, but her receptionist didn't get my phone number.  I left the spa very unhappy and the next day I went to the wedding in Texas without having my nails done. Upon my return to Tempe, I went back to Cobblestone. I spoke to Eileen again and expressed my displeasure. She apologized and asked me if I wanted to get my nails done that day. I said yes and she took me back for a manicure and pedicure right away. Eileen did a great job like always, and my nails looked very good.  After my nails were finished, I went up to the front to pay and she only charged me for the manicure, giving me the pedicure for free. She apologized again for what had happened the previous week.   I appreciate the free pedicure but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Truthfully, I do not feel like a valued client. The salon is nice and generally they do a great job, but I will not be returning.

Good luck making a quick trip out of a visit to Merchant Square. This place is HUGE and they have hundreds of booths to visit, all jam packed with treasures. I have literally spent hours wandering through this store! As expected, you will find lots of junk mixed in with some great antiques and second-hand items. You'll also come across new items that you can find at craft stores in the area - kind of lame in my opinion. I'm here for antiques and unique treasures, not stuff I can buy at a Michael's or Hobby Lobby. The glass cases in the middle of the store have better quality items, mainly jewelry. Prices vary by booth, so some of the merchandise is over-priced, but some of it is very reasonable.

Cannot say enough good things about this auto repair shop!!! I know almost nothing about cars, so getting any kind of repairs is scary because I know I could easily get ripped off. That is not the case here! Virgil and his team are honest, hard-working, good people. I have brought two different used cars here over the last three years for repairs and Highland Auto has saved me thousands of dollars, no doubt about it.  The location is nothing fancy, but don't let that deter you. You're not there for free coffee and wifi, are you? No - you're there to fix your car for a reasonable price. I recommend dropping off your vehicle and waiting at home/work/anywhere else. The "front desk" service is sparse... It's not *bad* service, but not good - understandable because Highland Auto's staff is small and everyone is always busy fixing cars. They can offer affordable prices because they aren't wasting money on a secretary or fancy waiting area.   There have been instances where I've called to get an update on my car repairs, and nobody answers the phone. It can be frustrating when you're waiting to get your car back, but I'd rather deal with sparse service than a shady/dishonest repair shop. If you get a quote from another auto repair place, bring the paperwork here and let Virgil take a look. Many times he advised me that I don't need to do the repairs recommended by the dealer (where I take my car to get oil changes); he is honest about what work is critical and what is just cosmetic. If you have an older used car, it doesn't always make sense to do certain repairs. It is a relief having Virgil on your side to guide you through the confusing world of car repairs. Virgil always beats prices from other repair shops, so it literally pays to get a second opinion. Plus, he will do an evaluation for free!  I won't waste my time with any other auto repair shop in Phoenix. Virgil is simply the best at what he does - providing quality, affordable car repairs. You can rest assured that you are not being scammed or ripped off here!

My parents have been coming here since the 80s, so I've been a lifetime patron, literally. Although I don't live close by, I try to come here about once a month for my fix of that salsa, omg! Elmer's is the nicest hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant I've ever visited. While it's definitely fast food, it is 10,000x better than a Filiberto's or any other fast food Mexican place.   Everything on the menu is great, but I always order the beef machaca burrito. Do it! So flavorful and juicy; I've never had better machaca anywhere else! If I'm here with my fam, we will order "strips" (chips and cheese) and a cheese quesadilla to share. The horchata is good but can be a little gritty at times. Elmer's makes their salsa in-house and serves it in squeeze bottles at each table. My brother and I fight over it, so we grab two bottles since we cannot share. They sell little salsa packets you can take home - I never leave without a few!

I called on Saturday morning to make an appointment for my two dogs, both needed their nails trimmed and one of my dogs needed a shampoo/grooming. I spoke with a man who said he had an opening in the schedule at 12pm, before handing the phone to a woman (Diane, the owner). Diane advised me that I could come in at 10am, to which I replied, "But he just told me 12?" and then she said, "How about 11am?" She didn't take down my name or phone number, giving me the impression that I didn't have an appointment reserved. Very confusing phone experience, and a little difficult to hear them because there were a ton of dogs barking in the background.   Canine Preferred is located in Old Town, but it's not a super nice or posh place. The exterior of the building is unassuming and basic, with an interior to match. When you enter the building, there is a lobby with counters that open up to the grooming area, so you can see the dogs getting groomed. It was very chaotic and noisy inside, with probably twenty dogs in the grooming area. The dogs aren't crated, so they are either tied up on a grooming table, or just running around. It doesn't seem very safe to have dogs running underneath the grooming stations - what if there was a ruckus and the dogs bumped the groomer while she was clipping my dog's hair or nails? What if my dog got hurt?!   On the opposite side of the lobby, there is a window opening into another room, where a man was sitting on the floor with a dog in his lap, cleaning its teeth. He was wearing a headlamp and had tools surrounding him on the floor. I don't know much about canine teeth cleaning, but it didn't seem very professional to me to have him out in the open, right by the lobby. It was a little unsettling to see a dog knocked out in someone's lap, getting its teeth cleaned.   Diane wrote my information on a notecard, asking me for my name, phone number, and how I wanted my dog groomed. She didn't ask any questions about whether or not my dog has all of her shots, or if she was currently/recently sick. I waited while she trimmed my little dog's nails, but had to leave my big dog behind for the shampoo/grooming. I would by lying if I said I didn't have some anxiety about leaving my pup there amid the chaos. I am a worried dog mom and the atmosphere inside Canine Preferred didn't do much to soothe my nerves.  After two hours, I got the call that my dog was ready to be picked up. I am happy to report that my dog looked great (and smelled good too!) when I picked her up. I paid $70 for my big dog to get a shampoo, grooming and nail trimming, as well as the nail trimming for my little dog. Definitely reasonable prices for nail trimming, only $5 per dog. The price for the shampoo/grooming is comparable to other groomers in the area, but doesn't come with the peace of mind I would have at, say, a Petco/Petsmart. I won't return here for a grooming simply because it is chaotic inside and gives me anxiety about leaving my dog behind. Since the nail trimming was so reasonably priced, I will return for that service.

Stopped by the Poisoned Pen for the first time to purchase a small gift for my work's "white elephant" gift exchange. I was hoping the store was similar to Changing Hands in Tempe, with lots of trinkets, cool house decor, jewelry, gag gifts, etc. While Poisoned Pen has a large selection of books, a clean and organized space, and friendly staff, they are lacking in merchandise. Yes there are lots of books and this is technically a bookstore, but I was disappointed there weren't many gift options. My choices were coffee mugs, notebooks, pens, tshirts and coloring books. That's all nice, but not quite what I was looking for. Ended up buying a book to give to a family member, but left without a gift for the office party.   5 stars for books, 5 stars for staff, 4 stars for variety of merchandise.

We hired AZ Taste to do the catering at my dad's wedding last year. The reception of 60 guests was held at their house in the backyard. We worked with Candace and Mary at AZ Taste to put together the event. They were great from the very first encounter - very knowledgeable, patient, and enthusiastic about what they do. Both ladies are true experts at party planning, and we felt calm and confident knowing they'd take good care of us.   We (my dad, step-mom, and I) met them at their office for an in-house tasting, giving us a chance to sample different dishes and pick out our favorites for the wedding reception. We went over table decorations, color schemes, and other specifics for the event. I liked that AZ Taste had a wide variety of table decor, ranging from flower arrangements to candelabra, so we didn't have to purchase dedicated table decor for the reception. While my dad and step-mom discussed prices and budget with Candace and Mary, I talked to one of the chefs, who gave me a quick tour of the kitchens.   The wedding reception went smoothly and all in all, we were very satisfied with AZ Taste. The event staff were fantastic. From the people passing out appetizers, to the woman who cut the cake, we were impressed by their professionalism and attention to detail! The staff on site were overseen by Mary, but you could tell that all the employees were very familiar with weddings and knew exactly what to do. From the initial event preparation to clean-up, it was a hassle-free experience and my dad and step-mom didn't have to spend a moment of their wedding day worrying about the catering company doing their job correctly. The food was perfect and tons of guests came up to my dad and step-mom to compliment them on the meal.  Whether you come to AZ Taste with a detailed vision for your event, or just a few general ideas, Mary and Candace will ensure that it's a memorable experience for your guests, stress-free for you as the host, and delicious for everyone involved! The menu options available are as varied as your imagination, but I do suggest letting Candace and Mary make some recommendations for your event. (While we didn't go with this idea, I really liked the concept of having a "mashed potato bar," where guests can assemble mashed potatoes with different toppings in a martini glass. Very modern, yet classy!)  If my family ever hosts another big event, or perhaps when I get married one day (in the distant future), we will be using AZ Taste for our catering needs! Thank you Mary and Candace!!!

Fiesta Burrito is meh. As an Arizona native I'm picky with my Mexican food. I am always skeptical of drive-thru Mexican restaurants but I was so hungry and the reviews looked good.....  I ordered the carnitas burrito and a medium hortchata. For the record, the hortchata is excellent! Sugary and sweet, but lighter than most. The burrito was huge - definitely a meal and a half. I didn't like the burrito at all, unfortunately. Everything was fresh and the tortilla, quac, and pico were on point. The carnitas, however, was dry and fatty. I couldn't even chew through some bites.  I'm not really surprised with my experience at Fiesta Burrito. It's cheap and quick and similar to most fast food Mexican joints. I might come back here in the future. If I do, I will be ordering vegetarian! Cheese enchiladas, bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and don't forget the hortchata!

My boyfriend and I are obsessed with Defalco's. It's less than a mile from my house so we frequently eat here. Everything we have ordered thus far has been amazing, flavorful and fresh.   I believe that the owners' family originally came from Italy, which explains the atmosphere of the deli. It reminds me of a typical european deli, mixing fresh foods you can order to your liking, along with a small selection of groceries and specialty items.  I like to buy certain groceries here but they are a little more expensive, given that the majority are imported. They've got some great products - fancy cheese, a giant selection of olive oil, unique pastas (gnocchi, fusilli), and lots of wine.   To date, my boyfriend and I have tried:  cheesesteak (must try it!!! get it on the Italian roll with grilled onions, mushrooms, and peppers),  chicken parmigiana sandwich,  italian sausage sandwich with peppers (homemade sausage, i would recommend adding cheese), cheese ravioli, artichoke and vegetable lasagna (amazing!), caprese salad (homemade mozzarella cheese!!), and  spinach, avocado and goat cheese salad.  We are looking forward to eating everything on the menu, but it is always difficult to try something new when everything we've tasted has been amazing.  Don't forget about ordering desserts! Tiramisu, cannolis, chocolate eclairs, lemoncello cake... I have a sweet tooth and I am happy to report that they do not disappoint.

Every time I'm in here, I try to talk the owners into hiring me, and sending me around the world to buy treasures for the store. No luck yet, but I am not discouraged. Love the variety of items you'll find here, from clothes and accessories, to jewelry, to home decorations! They also have little knick-knacks, including coins from other countries! Everything they sell is authentic and purchased directly by the owners during their international travels. Prices are fair for the items, and quality is never lacking. If you think something's too expensive, don't forget the people who make these items are being paid fairly (unlike laborers who supply things for Target and Cost Plus World Market).  I do wish the store was located in an area with more foot traffic. It's tucked inside a courtyard off of Mill Ave. If they had more street exposure, I'm sure they'd do more business! I'm a big fan of Yucatecan Imports so I definitely want them to make money and stay in business. I like to buy Christmas and birthday gifts here because I always find something unique and special.   Don't forget, cash only!!! Park behind the courtyard instead of trying to find something on Mill.

I've been to countless shows at the Marquee over the years. I love the variety of entertainment you'll find here! Most recently I've seen Ellie Goulding, Animal Collective, and SBTRKT. As a kid I have a vivid memory of going to a Russian cat circus at the Marquee (yes, Russian cats doing tricks).  Overall the venue is nice - tons of space for crowds and/or dancing, good sound system, large stage, ok bathrooms, and a bar. I'm not a smoker so I can't give you a report on the patio.   Vodka and cranberry is $6, beer on tap is $7.

Delhi Palace is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Located very close to ASU, I used to come here all the time while I was in school. They have a great lunch buffet everyday, then they are closed for a couple of hours before re-opening for dinner. As expected, the quality of the lunch buffet is slightly lower than the dinner meals, because the food is made in giant batches rather than prepared on demand. It's still delicious, don't worry!  I love that they rotate their selection so you always get something different at lunch. The classics stay the same - chicken tikka masala, lamb, rice(s), vegetable fritters. They always have vegetarian dishes and some vegan options as well. Garlic naan is delivered to your table throughout your meal. The lunch buffet includes chai tea and dessert (rice pudding anyone?!).   I like to come here for dinner when I'm with a group of people, so we can order a variety of dishes and share. Service is always great and they'll remember you if you come here as often as I do! Try the lunch buffet, then bring your family here for dinner. You won't be disappointed!

I really love this place. I adopted baby chicks in January so have been a frequent shopper over the last six months. Every employee I've encountered was friendly, but more importantly, knowledgeable about chickens! I have questions every time I come in.... Should I give my chicks electrolytes in their water? Should I go with organic or natural food? What kind of snacks can I give the birds? Why is my smallest bird not laying eggs? Without fail, they've always had answers and advice for me.   I love that this is a local business and even better - it's family owned and operated!! They are small but the store is jam packed with supplies for cats, dogs, chickens, horses, you name it! They sell real cat and dog food - you know, the kind with protein and ingredients you recognize, not just animal by-products and corn meal. In my opinion, pets are part of the family and deserve to eat real food so it's worth the extra money.   The quality of the products and the helpfulness of the staff keep me coming back. Tempe Feed and Tack is 1,000 times better than any Petco or Petsmart. While they may not offer as many products, you'll find all the essentials here.  PS - Recently they started carrying CHICKEN HARNESSES so I can walk my chickens. Haven't purchased one yet but seriously considering it! ;)

A nice change of pace from Goodwill, my usual thrifting go-to. I love the new building and am so impressed by the construction. It makes the whole area look much nicer and mixed-use construction is a smarter way to build cities. The interior of Gracie's is clean and organized, but the selection is much smaller than other thrift stores I've visited. High quality items and reasonable prices, with occasional sales that make everything even cheaper. Last time I was here, I found an amazing vintage fur shawl that was made in Phoenix. There was even a movie ticket in the pocket from the 50s!

One of my favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix!!! I've been coming here since I was a little kid and have really enjoyed watching P.Croissants' success over the years! They've been open for over 20 years, a testament to their fantastic food and great service! Their current location is much larger and nicer than their previous store (same plaza). The owners are kind and genuine - this is a small business you definitely want to support!  Everything on the menu is delicious but my favorites are croissant breakfast sandwiches (egg, bacon, cheese) and their cream cheese/strawberry croissants. Every flavored croissant is amazing, so you'll be able to find a flavor to please everyone. Croissants are baked daily at like 3am, so they are as fresh as can be... however, when they run out of a flavor, that's it for the day. (Grab yours early in the morning, or order in advance!) Excellent coffee - espresso, americanos, lattes, etc. P.Croissant has tasty lunch sandwiches, as well as salads and soups.   If you know you'll want more than a couple of croissants on a weekend or holiday, ORDER A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE! Also, don't forget to grab a stamp card if you order a sandwich!

Hands down best independent bookstore in Phoenix! Great selection of new and used books. If they don't have what you want in store, they'll usually order it for you. There are tons of trinkets, home decorations, and unique gifts. I really like that you can trade in old books for store credit.  Changing Hands hosts many authors, lecturers, musicians, and other important and famous people. I've been to see several authors but my favorite memory was when they hosted GRUMPY CAT!

This LUSH is too small to be in the Scottsdale mall. There is literally not enough room for all the products, staff, and shoppers!!! I hate visiting this LUSH simply because I feel claustrophobic and rushed (trying to get out of the crowded store as quickly as I can). I've been to the LUSH in Chandler and like that one better - it's a bigger store so everything isn't squished (and it's also less busy). Bottom line: LUSH, I know you're making tons of money at the Scottsdale mall. You can afford a bigger store!  Employees are very eager to help and you won't go more than 2 minutes unnoticed in the store. Don't be afraid to ask for guidance! It's a confusing and slightly unorganized store. Ask questions, ask to try/smell items, ask for free samples!   Products I recommend: Olive Branch body wash, Juicy shampoo, Daddy-o shampoo, all of their face masks, Whoosh body wash, and the sea salt face scrub.   Don't forget to save your black plastic containers - they give you a free face mask if you bring in 5 empty containers!! Score!

We have a huge backyard, but our two dogs are social butterflies so we bring them here occasionally as a treat. We have a border collie lab mix and a chihuahua mix; the chi has a ton of energy and thinks she's a big dog, so both go into the big dog/active dog play area. Always a great mix of dog breeds and personalities, so our girls have tons of friends to interact with. I would say that 90% of the time we have no issues, but sometimes there is a dog being too aggressive with one of my pups, so I'll have to intervene. Most owners are attentive to their dogs so any hostile behavior is quickly put to a stop by both dog parents. 5/5 stars for the variety of dogs to play with, 5/5 stars for their attentive owners.   Being in Scottsdale, the facility itself is obviously very nice. Very large grassy area for the dogs, as well as some concrete structures for them to climb on/in (kind of like an obstacle course). Even on a busy day, there is plenty of room for the pups to run around. Plenty of benches for the dog parents to sit and keep watch. There are drinking fountains for both dogs and people. Lots of trees and shade structures to keep you cool during the summer days (but really, just wait until it's dark outside). They even have poop baggies so you have no excuses if you forgot yours at home. Common courtesy people - pick up after your pups! 5/5 stars for the facility, 4/5 stars for the amount of poo left by bad dog parents, 5/5 stars for the maintenance crew who keep this place so nice!

I lived around the corner from Seattle Espresso for years and was a frequent patron, coming here several times a week. As someone who doesn't really like coffee, I would always order the White Russian Mocha, which is basically white chocolate powder, milk, and espresso. Very sweet and sugary, with just a kick of caffeine!   The employees are always great here, and once you've become a frequent customer, they will remember your name and your drink preferences. More than once, I've entered SE to find my drink already made, waiting for me on the counter!! So nice.   I love Seattle Espresso's "Sick Tea," which is a combo of a few different teas. It's the best for when you're starting to feel sick. I like to buy some to keep at home for days when I'm feeling under the weather. If you ask nicely, they will even give you a few tea bags to take home (since it's a loose leaf tea).   The pastry selection isn't very good, so don't come here for breakfast. They have a small selection of pastries and bagels, which are good quality but nothing special. Unfortunately there is no toaster for the bagels (hint hint, management!).  Don't forget your stamp card!!!

Don't be afraid of the parking lot and appearance! Tacos Jalisco is delicious, authentic Mexican food. It's clean inside and the staff is nice.   I ordered a cheese quesadilla and carne asada taco combo. It came with a side of beans and a tiny salad. It was cooked to order - you can see into the kitchen so you know it's fresh. They have a salsa bar with limes, grilled peppers, and three or four types of homemade salsa.  I was very hungry when I ordered and the combo meal was just large enough to leave me stuffed! Anything extra would have been too much food. :)   I ordered a horchata and it was delicious! The vanilla and cinnamon flavors blended smoothly. I love horchata so I'm happy it was great! I plan to will get horchata every time I go!

Hit or miss depending on what you order and who's working. Classics like Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken are always safe, but I'm usually disappointed when I try something new here. Stay away from the wonton soup - no veggies, just salty broth and wontons. Recently I tried the Thai style lettuce wraps and was not impressed. It was way too spicy for me, and lacked any real flavor other than being hot.   The woman at the counter was friendly and helpful, but when I asked an employee clearing tables for a fork, she told me to get one from the drink station. When I replied that there were no forks, she told me they were washing them all. What kind of restaurant runs out of forks on Friday at 130pm? There were two sets of plastic silverware at the drink station, but we needed three. Spoke with the same employee regarding the plastic forks, and she looked miserable dealing with my request, but went to get us another plastic fork. I'm sorry, two plastic forks doesn't cut it when there are three at a table.  Not that big of a deal, but my dad's fortune cookie didn't have a fortune. I guess he wasn't too lucky that day.

I came here a few weeks ago for my friend's birthday. This is her normal nail salon and I wanted to treat her to a manicure for her birthday. We made an appointment a few days earlier. My friend went to her regular girl (Kelly, I think?) and I got some random technician. This was my first visit to this AZ Tip & Toes location and will definitely be my last visit. I am torn between one and two stars, but had to go with a lower rating because my experience was terrible.   Even though half the salon was empty, they didn't seat my friend and I together. When we arrived, we told them it was her birthday and asked to sit together but the technicians' stations weren't set up near each other. We were literally on opposite ends of the row of stations... too far apart to talk to each other. It was super lame because it was her birthday and I wanted to spend that hour chatting and catching up. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think it's too difficult to grab a basket of polish and tools and move to a different station. Especially when a regular client requests it, and it's her birthday! Whatever.  I had gel polish on so I needed to soak them off before getting new polish. My nail tech said they don't do soak offs and proceeded to remove my gel polish with an electronic nail file (the kind they use to prep your nails for acrylics). I frequently get my nails done with gel and my normal salon always soaks the polish off, because it is less damaging to the nailbeds. I told my nail tech I was worried about the electronic file damaging my nails, but she said it was just as bad as a soak off. I asked again for a soak off, and she said no. I think this is because a soak off takes a lot longer than using an electronic nail file... but they weren't busy, and I requested it twice. I guess the customer isn't always right?! She proceeded to use the electronic nail file, and took off the gel polish and the top layer of my nails. (Three weeks later, my gel polish is gone and my nails are looking terrible and very thin.)  The nail tech removed the polish, and put my nails in a bowl of acetone briefly to get off any remaining polish. She squirted the acetone out of a nondescript bottle (important detail for later). She then went through a normal gel manicure. Towards the end of the mani (but before the top coat!!!) I asked to see their selection of gems/rhinestones. My nail tech said of course, but then forgot and put the top coat on one hand. Once the top coat on one hand was already "cured," she remembered I asked to see the rhinestones. She offered to get them now and put them on the hand that didn't have top coat, but I said no. It was a bummer because I wanted something fancy, and was willing to pay extra for it... but obviously I didn't want gems on only one hand.    The worst part of my whole experience: at the end of the manicure, she sucked up the remaining acetone my nails were in, back into the nondescript bottle. That means she is reusing acetone for different clients! DISGUSTING!!!! I know for a fact that acetone is cheap, and definitely cheaper than losing clients due to unsanitary practices!  Bottom line: my friend's nails looked nice, my nails looked nice, but the customer service here is terrible and unsanitary practices are simply unacceptable. The salon can improve by trying to meet client requests (friends sitting together, gems/rhinestones when requested). It would be nice if they offered bottled water upon arriving - it's HOT outside - and they could install small hooks at each station to hang your purse up. Cold water is just a common courtesy in Phoenix, and classy women don't want to put their purses on the ground! Finally, stop reusing acetone for multiple clients and reassure us that you are complying with normal sanitation standards!!!   I paid $70-something for both manicures and almost walked out of there without tipping because I was so disappointed. I expressed my displeasure to my friend who was surprised to hear it, as she has always had a good experience with her normal girl. My friend said she's never seen them reusing acetone, but that doesn't change what happened to me. I will not be returning to this AZ Tip & Toes salon without a big apology from the owners and a reassurance that they have implemented more sanitary practices. I recommend you take your business elsewhere.

Called and waited on hold for 10 minutes. Hung up and called again and waited another 8min for someone to actually answer my question. I wanted to buy a HydroFlask water bottle. I was transferred to three different people because nobody really knew if they carried them. Eventually an employee said yes, they did. So, I drove down here just to discover that NO, in fact, they do not carry HydroFlasks.   -1 star for terrible phone service  -3 stars for misinformation

I'm in here all the time... well, at least twice a month. This location is just like all the other Lowe's you've been to, but I will say that they have extremely helpful staff here. Once you're able to track down an employee, they will do whatever they can to help you with your project. (It would be nice to have more employees walking around the store, looking for people like me who need help! Sometimes it's difficult to find someone to assist me.)   Recently I dealt with the returns department because I bought a misting fan a few months ago and the motor already died. I was friendly but not necessarily the easiest customer to deal with. I wanted to the leave store with a replacement fan that day, rather than a giftcard or a refund. I ended up working with an employee and her supervisor to come up with a solution. I really appreciate that they were able to process my return without sending me to the 800 number, and they even let me take the floor model because they didn't have any other units in stock. They were patient and understanding, and truly wanted to provide a positive customer experience!   My only complaint isn't really directed at the employees or this location. A lot of the items they sell are made cheaply and break after a few uses (or even when installing the items!). I don't always buy the most expensive equipment so it's understandable that the quality can be less than superior, but why do they even stock cheaply-made items that are doomed to break? Thankfully the returns department is pretty good about taking items back (just hang on to your receipt!).   PS. They offer a guarantee on plants - I believe it's one year. Perfect for someone who kills a lot of plants... just bring the dead plant and your receipt, and they'll refund you!   PPS. Wish they had a service where you can track your purchases with your credit card or phone number. It would make returning items even easier. Requiring paper receipts for a return is so old school!

I love that you can call ahead to reserve a spot in line. No extra wasted time in the germ-filled waiting room! If you're sick and feeling miserable, the last thing you want to do is wait around in the doctors office. Much better to wait at home on the couch, and then arrive just in time for your appointment!  This location has always been good to me. The staff, nurses and doctors are all friendly, patient and caring. I've been here for routine colds and infections multiple times in the last two years. Since I am a repeat client, the two main doctors know who I am and are somewhat familiar with my health issues. It's so nice to have a semi-personal experience at an urgent care! As horrible as being sick is, at least the doctors office experience is quick and relatively painless.   5 stars for doctors and staff, 5 stars for convenience, 5 stars for cleanliness and atmosphere. I will continue to visit this location anytime I am feeling ill.

Love their chai tea. The expansion and additions in recent years have been really nice. I remember several occasions when I couldn't find a seat anywhere. So thankful that's not the case now - thanks for expanding! The noise level is usually low enough for working or studying, and the music selection is good.  My only complaint is the vibe given off by some of the employees. A few times I have felt almost unwelcome in the coffee shop. I am placing my order and the employee could not care less. The "too cool for you," hipster standoffish attitude can come across unpleasant. Where is the customer service? Smile more, I promise you everything is awesome!

If you're not craving ice cream, you will be once you walk past Cold Stone and get a whiff of those freshly baked waffle cones!! Love this location. The owner, Angela, is very kind and attentive. I work close by and can't control myself around frozen desserts, so we've become good friends in recent days. I love all the "Creations" options available, and what's even nicer is that Angela lets you change the recipes slightly if you want.   Plan to spend $5-9 depending how fancy you get and what size you choose. In and out quickly, every time. Ask to try one flavor, or two, or ten. You really can't go wrong here!

Came here during my lunch break! The owner (Elias I think) took my order with a smile and a couple of jokes. Really friendly guy who clearly enjoys what he does. He gave me a few recommendations on what to order. I ended up getting the chicken enchiladas, which were very tasty. The plate came with rice and beans on the side. I also ordered a small horchata which was really refreshing on a hot afternoon. My coworker had the bean and cheese burrito - simple but delicious.   Behind the cash register is part of the kitchen. You can watch the "assembly line" and see your food getting prepared right in front of you.   The restaurant isn't fancy but the food is great quality, authentic Mexican food. It was clean and felt welcoming. I will definitely return!!

I am a very worried chicken mom and finally decided to get my birds a check up (their first one) for their first birthday. Instead of wrangling four chickens into my car and driving 10 miles to the clinic, I booked a home visit. It was more expensive but made the most sense for me and my birds. Could you imagine four panicking chickens in your backseat? It just does not sound appealing.   Dr. Heather Bjornebo was the vet who came to my house and she brought three assistants with her - one vet tech and two vet students. They were awesome - very knowledgable and put me at ease! The entire visit was maybe 30 minutes, and that included a thorough examination of each chicken. I had one million questions and Dr. B answered all of them with confidence. She surveyed my coop and run, and made a few recommendations. She took a poo sample to test for parasites and worms - and called me two hours later with the results! They do most testing at their clinic so the turnaround time is incredible. Thankfully my chickies are parasite-free!  100% would recommend AZ Exotic Animal Hospital to anyone with an unusual pet. I hope I never have to see them again ('cause that would mean my birds were sick), but I would absolutely choose them to care for my chickens if necessary. 5 stars for Dr. Bjornebo and staff, 5 stars for convenience of home visit, 5 stars for everything.   Yes, it was expensive but my chickens are my babies and I WILL pay for peace of mind! I am very satisfied with my experience. THANK YOU AZ EXOTIC ANIMAL HOSPITAL!

Saigon Bowl is an unexpected gem. Hidden in a quiet strip mall, it serves wonderful Vietnamese food. The restaurant is typically busy for lunch but quieter at night. I've been the only customer in the restaurant on more than one occasion.   I have been coming here for years for the pho and bun. The fresh spring rolls made with rice paper are delicious! The owners are always on site keeping an eye on things and running the kitchen.  I recommend ordering bun - a cold vermicelli noodle salad. Add your choice of meat and maybe a cut-up egg roll, and enjoy! Another favorite is the classic pho, a savory beef soup, featuring thinly sliced beef, noodles, bean spouts, jalapeños, mint, basil, and more.

Mmmm, incredible! Loved my meal here!!! First time at the Dhaba and I am so impressed! We ordered paneer tikka masala, lamb curry, and aloo gobi.... And naan of course! The main dishes come with jasmine rice. Everything was fantastic. Rich, flavorful, and fresh! I will be back VERY soon!  5 stars, no doubt!

I've only been here for breakfast once but will definitely be returning soon! Yum! I had the strawberry creme brûlée waffle and my friend got the crab cake eggs benedict. Both plates were amazing! My waffle tasted like dessert and I couldn't finish it. I tasted my friend's crab cake eggs benedict and it was heavenly. I will order that next time!!   As far as drinks, I had a peach bellini and my friend tried one of the bloody marys. She was excited because they had five or six different kinds of bloody marys to choose from. Personally it's not my thing, but she said it tasted great. The bellini was sweet but I would recommend getting a double.   Our server was nice and attentive but not bothersome. We arrived relatively early (around 915) so there wasn't any wait to sit down, but by the time we left, the entrance was full of people waiting for tables. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and hip without being too aggressive. Unlike other places in Old Town, the music wasn't blasting and I didn't feel like I was at a club for breakfast. I enjoyed the food and will come back soon!

I love this place! Going to Lolo's is always a delicious treat for me. You can't eat fried chicken and waffles everyday, after all.   Lolo's recently relocated slightly north on Scottsdale, to a much larger and nicer space. Now an independent building, the new Lolo's features a hip indoor/outdoor bar. Although the old location served alcohol, now it feels like an attractive destination for a drink. I plan on coming here just for drinks in the future.   I ate dinner at Lolo's shortly after the move and am very pleased with the experience. Everything we ordered was amazing as expected. The portions were huge! Our waitress was sweet and prompt with our food and drinks.   Tip: order the chicken and waffles. If you're feeling especially malnourished, add a side of mac and cheese. No matter what you order, I promise you won't leave hungry! But most importantly, don't forget the koolaid!!!!

Decided to try out Yoga Lamar because it's close to my house and there was a Yelp deal available (basically half-off a month membership). I had high expectations after reading the other reviews but sad to say that Yoga Lamar didn't meet them. While I should have known that this wouldn't be an authentic yoga experience because it is located inside the salon, I was still disappointed.  The yoga studio is located inside Spa Lamar, next to the hair stylist area. The doors to the yoga room are thin so you can hear the hair stylists and their clients throughout your yoga class. This is distracting and doesn't make for a very "zen" experience. The room itself is clean and bright. The room isn't very big but thankfully the classes I went to were small. It would be uncomfortable to have more than 10 or 15 people in there at one time. The AC was broken during one of the classes I attended, so we were really sweaty about halfway through the class. Someone asked the instructor to turn on the AC, but it was broken, so we opened the doors to the room. It felt much better temperature-wise, but the noise level from the salon increased, making it harder to meditate.  Being that this is a Scottsdale yoga studio, the other students were mainly older, stay-at-home housewives. The women didn't give off friendly vibes, so I felt out of place not knowing anyone else. The atmosphere felt a little gossipy and cliquey, which is an unfortunate vibe for a yoga studio. On more than one occasion, some students in the class were chatty throughout the practice, making meditation difficult. One comment I heard during class was, "My butt will look so good after this position! I am so fat." UGH. I like yoga studios where students don't speak throughout class, unless they need help from the instructor. This is not a gym hour with your girlfriends; it's a meditative yoga class.    The instructor for one of my classes was wearing a very thin, white tank-top without anything underneath. Needless to say, some of her body parts were poppin' out of the tank-top - very unprofessional and distracting during the class. While I'm not asking for 100% modesty, at a minimum you should have your nips covered! I was not happy about that and felt uncomfortable during the class. I made it a point to avoid her classes after that experience with her.  I am disappointed to report that I haven't received any contact from the studio after my month-long membership ended. I didn't feel like a valued client when I was there, and I still don't feel valued as there has been no follow-up communication. Why not call me and see how my experience was, and try to get me back in on a regular membership? Don't you want your Yelp-deal clients to become regular clients?

Came here on my lunch break and ordered two tacos to go. Similar set up to a Chipotle, where you go through an assembly line and customize your tacos, burritos, etc. Unlike Chipotle, Panchero's doesn't offer "responsibly sourced" ingredients and GMO-free options. A plus side to Panchero's is there was no line at 12:30pm on a Thursday... but that should be a warning sign that the restaurant is sub par. There were only two people eating lunch when I was there.   As soon as I started driving away, I noticed wet spots on my passenger seat. The tacos were leaking through the tin foil, through the paper bag, and onto my seat! Ugh! Less than two minutes away from the restaurant, and it was a mess. Rather than drive back to the office, I pulled into a parking lot to eat my tacos. I didn't want to risk having them leak even more during the 7-minute drive back to work.  Even though I had just ordered the tacos five minutes earlier, the tortillas were soggy. I like the concept of cooking tortillas on the spot and having them freshly made with each order, but I cannot stand for soggy tortillas. I ordered one steak taco and one carnitas taco. The steak was very chewy and fatty - it was difficult to eat so I only had a few bites. The carnitas were tender but not very flavorful.  If I decide to try Panchero's again, I will definitely be eating in the restaurant rather than ordering take out. I don't even think they should offer "to go" as an option considering the mess the tacos made on my front seat and the fact that the tortillas get soggy after only a few minutes. I'm not sure if I'll be back - I'm not sure it's worth the risk when Chipotle is just a mile away.

I've been here a few times for dinner. Great atmosphere with the indoor/outdoor space. I usually order something with ahi tuna because it is sooo good. I've also tried their pulled pork, which is equally as tasty. Drinks are strong!

Came here recently for happy hour with some old friends. We had a groupon for two flights of beer, which let us try 5 of their normal beers and one seasonal beer. All of the flavors were tasty and I liked them all, but the hefeweizen was my favorite (to be expected since I prefer lighter beer).   The brewery is fairly small but we didn't feel crowded even though most tables were taken. One corner of the room has a couch and some dart boards. They've got a few TVs that play a slideshow of dogs (wondering if I can get my pups featured on that slideshow?!?!). There is all-you-can-eat free popcorn but the menu has no food on it - a bummer when you're slightly tipsy and in need of a real snack!  Beer 5/5, service 4/5, ambiance 3.5/5, food 0/5. This is a good place to meet for a couple of beers, but not somewhere to spend an entire evening. Will be back for a brew or two.  PS. Wish this place was dog-friendly. It would be awesome if I could bring my dogs here!

$30 for pedicure with callus remover. I came at 5pm on a Sunday and wasn't sure they were still open or had availability to do a pedi, but they got me in right away. Nice!!   My massage chair wasn't working very well and didn't massage my whole back. That is my favorite part of a pedi so I was disappointed. My nail lady was decent but not the best. She wasn't very chatty so I mostly sat in silence while she did my nails. They looked good and my heels were very smooth after the callus remover.   Sadly, less than 48 hours later and the polish on two of my toenails already chipped!  3 stars for ambiance, 3 stars for staff, 5 stars for convenience.

I've been to the Torch Theatre twice to see my friends perform. The venue is nice and clean. The theatre itself has a large stage and several rows of seating, probably enough space for 20-30 people. Admission is affordable and you feel like you're supporting a good thing. The actors are passionate about what they do and even in the audience, it's a pleasure to be a part of the fun. The improve shows had several groups doing 15-minute sets and I liked all of the skits.   I've never been, but apparently the Torch Theatre offers free improv classes every month. I think it's the first Saturday of every month. I have been thinking about going to a class, but haven't made it yet.  The Torch Theatre has limited parking in front, but lots of space behind the building. The lightrail is very close if you don't feel like driving. Across the street is Hula's, a great spot for a snack, dinner, or just drinks.

Great service and quick turn around time for dry cleaning items. They offer same day and next day dry cleaning, but I usually bring in 5+ items so I don't mind waiting a couple of days. If you need something rushed, just let them know! Sue and Joe are so cute and helpful. I've probably brought 25 items in for cleaning over the last few months and overall I am very happy with the results. Two dresses I brought had spots on them that weren't fully removed after the first round of dry cleaning, so Joe offered to do them again for free. Second time around, the spots were gone! Excellent!  They offer alterations and repairs so I've had a couple of pairs of pants hemmed, and a few zippers replaced. I'm very happy I found a place near my house where I can take my thrift store finds and get them tailored to my short self. The prices are reasonable even for tricky stains and repairs. Thank you Sue and Joe!! See you soon!  5 stars for quality and service, 5 stars for convenience.

Republic Ramen is an affordable and delicious ramen house in Tempe. I don't eat here frequently in the summer because it's 1,000 degrees outside and who wants soup when it's so hot?! But, it's a great meal on a cold day, and if it's raining you'll probably catch me here, slurping down a giant bowl of noodles.  The portions are huge so expect to take leftovers home. I always order my ramen "traditional style," meaning the noodles are topped with bamboo shoots, seaweed, naruto (slices of fermented fish - they are white with a pink spiral - TRY THEM!), and scallions. You get your choice of meat, but I always go with tofu because the quality of their chicken isn't very good. I haven't tried the other meats because the tofu is a good fit with all of those traditional toppings. (Honestly, I'm apprehensive to try any other meats after having their chicken a few times. Why bother with the potential of being disappointed when the tofu is delicious?)   Republic Ramen also offers Udon noodle bowls and a few rice plates, but you really can't go wrong with the traditional ramen bowls. I've ordered shrimp tempura and edamame as a side, both of which are a nice supplement to the soup if you're craving something more than broth and noodles. They have a wide variety of boba teas, regular tea, and "slush" drinks. They also sell beer and sake but I've never ordered anything alcoholic.   The ambiance of the restaurant is good. Nothing fancy but it certainly isn't a hole in the wall. Sound is average, depending on how many other people are eating there. They've got some super cute Asian art on the walls and it always makes me smile. Lots of seating indoors and outside, so even if it's busy you aren't super close to anyone else. Depending where you sit and how curious you are, you can peek inside the kitchen to see large pots of broth on the stove and the chefs hard at work.  Great value, very rich flavors, and good quality food (minus the meat, like I said...). The service is nothing special, but it certainly isn't terrible. I've never had to wait any longer than 10 minutes to get my food. All of the employees are helpful and friendly, but it isn't a restaurant where you get waited on. My only complaint regarding service is I've seen an employee's son behind the counter before. I understand if you can't afford childcare, but keep him in the back! You don't want me to think that you employ 6-year-old children, right...?

I always order chai tea because I'm not a coffee drinker. 5 stars for the chai, 4 stars for the pastries. I've ordered a couple different ones and haven't been impressed. Pleasant and quiet atmosphere but nothing that really stands out. All of the employees are nice!

So much fun! I attended their pet painting class with a girlfriend of mine because we found a killer deal on Groupon. It was $50 for both of us to do a pet portrait. Here's the deal: you send them a picture of your pet about a week before your class. They sketch it onto canvas so when you come in, you're just filling it in. You can do up to two pets in a painting. My friend did her two dogs and I did one of my chickens.   Peggy is the manager and hosted the class. She gave a quick 5-minute tutorial before letting everyone lose. She was walking around the room throughout the class and giving tips, stepping in to help when needed, and answering questions. She was very friendly, patient and encouraging. She walked us through the pet portraits step-by-step and promised everyone would leave happy with their pet portraits. I can't speak for the rest of my class, but I am very satisfied with my artwork!   My class was BYOB so we brought a bottle of wine to share. I'm glad I didn't drink more, otherwise my painting would've been sloppy, haha. The class was scheduled 730-930pm, but my friend and I stayed until almost 1030! We weren't the only ones still there at that time, but it was surprising to check the clock and realize 3 hours had passed. Peggy never mentioned the time or rushed us in any way, so that was very much appreciated.  5/5 stars, would return. Peggy gave us a discount card for any future visits, thanks!!!

**My review is only for the pool.** I came here recently to see a dj perform, as a part of the weekly Talking Stick pool "RELEASE" parties. We showed up around 3pm with the hopes of partying in the pool for awhile and dancing our butts off. Unfortunately, the pool was very disgusting from the first minute we got in. There were tons of people in the pool so no room to swim and not a lot of room to stand around and dance. The pool itself had greenish murky water and smelled terrible, like pee! YUCK! This is not a public city pool full of young kids - it's a resort pool full of adults. Who is peeing in the water???!!! Awful.  Obviously I didn't spend much time in the water. Sadly, there were no open lounge chairs to sit in, but I did see tons of folded up lounge chairs further away from the pool. Given how busy it was, I'm surprised that the staff didn't unfold those extra lounge chairs for guests to sit in. I just perched on the end of the chair and waited for my friends to come back from the bar.   We moved over to the dance area in front of where the dj was playing and started to boogie over there for a few minutes, but honestly I didn't want to stay long. I could smell myself, and I smelled disgusting.... not because I don't shower frequently, but because I was just in a pool full of pee-water. I felt so gross. I am disappointed and sickened by the whole experience. I didn't come to a resort's pool party to swim in pee - I wanted to relax, drink, and dance! I have absolutely no desire to come back here for any RELEASE pool parties, and will never allow myself to get in that pool again.

It has been awhile since I've had such a good meal! I eat amazing food all the time so my bar for excellence is set very high. Grassroots Kitchen did not disappoint! I met a friend here for dinner at 6pm. It was busy and we didn't have a reservation so our options were sitting on the heated patio, or sitting at a "communal" table inside. We opted for the shared table inside because even with the heaters, the patio was toooo cold! We sat at the end of the shared table and had no issues with the couple sitting next to us.   My friend and I ordered a meat and cheese board for $10 (HH price) that came with a giant loaf of fresh bread, mixed nuts, olives, and honey. Delicious! There were three types of cheese (brie, goat, and maybe munster) and three types of meat (salami, prosciutto, and...?). Everything was high quality and so flavorful! It was a lot of food for the two of us, so we were pretty full by the time we ordered our entree. We decided to split a plate, which was the right decision.  We went with the waitress' recommendation and ordered the short ribs with cheesy jalapeno grits. OMG. Amazing!!! Best short rib I've ever had, ever! As I said, it has been a long time since I've had such a tasty meal! The short rib was plenty of food to split between two, and between the entree and the appetizer, we were stuffed! My one and only complaint is that the short rib came with TWO pieces of asparagus. TWO!? That's it?! I need some veggies, c'mon guys!   5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance, 3 stars for a pathetic portion of asparagus. I'LL BE BACK SOON!

I come to this Pita Jungle occasionally for lunch since it is close to my office. I love the variety of healthy options they offer - fancy salads, wraps, and appetizers. I almost always order hummus, whether it's regular, bell pepper, or cilantro. So good!   My favorite salad is the tuna honey sesame salad. It has seared yellowfin tuna, leafy greens, fresh strawberries and mangos, topped with a honey sesame dressing. Awesome!  For entrees, I have tried the mahi mahi with pita chips, the chicken del sol, chicken tikka masala, chicken and onion lavosh pizza, and pesto turkey lavosh wrap.   Pita Jungle is a good choice for a fresh, healthy meal. They update their menu with different specials so you can always find something new to try.

I've been here a handful of times in the last few months and have mixed feelings about this salon. The quality of the manicure is great but I am not a big fan of their customer service. Teres has a completely different feel than any other nail salon I've been to; they are upscale and definitely catering to the affluent Scottsdale woman. Rather than individual stations, the nail techs are set up in a line - literally "a bar" of nail techs. When you arrive, you sign in by filling out a service form, selecting manicure/pedicure, gel/regular polish, nail art/glitter, luxuries (scrubs, masks, lotions). I think it's a little silly and pretentious to call scrubs and lotions "luxuries," but again, they are catering to a certain clientele. Unfortunately, the service hadn't matched the nice ambiance.  You can text them to schedule, and they send you a confirmation and reminder text of your appointment. They have been good about getting me in with only a day or two notice. The best part about Teres is their nail art. When you make an appointment, let them know you want nail art so they can add extra time to your appointment. If you want something super fancy, detailed, or art on all 10 nails, make sure you tell them "it's intricate art" when booking your appointment. Several times my tech has told me there wasn't enough time to do the design I wanted on all my nails - disappointing because I did specify nail art when I made the appointment. Ask for extra, EXTRA time if you want a fancy design!!!   The girl at the front counter is very friendly and helpful, but I am not impressed with the service I've received from the nail techs. I have been with three different techs and have had mediocre experiences with all of them. They don't make much of an effort to talk to me... I know doing small talk all day can be exhausting, but this is a service industry and I don't want to sit in silence for an hour. I want to feel valued!! Aside from little conversation with me, I am disappointed with the service because I've heard the techs gossiping about their coworkers. It is very immature and unprofessional to be insulting someone you work with in front of a client!   The last time I came here, I brought my roommate with me for her very first professional manicure. My roommate's nail tech was rude about her nails being super short. Yes, she bites her nails, but we are also paying $45 to have you do them, and we told you this was her first manicure. Give her a good experience so she will come back for a second mani! Don't be rude... do you think she will return if you insult her short nails and make her feel bad?  While the nail art is the best in Scottsdale, the service is poor and prices are too high to be listening to gossipy techs and getting insulted for having short nails. After my last visit with my roommate, I decided to cancel my membership because I was so disappointed that her tech insulted her. When I talked to the receptionist about canceling, she just handed me a form to fill out. She didn't ask me why I was canceling, or seem concerned to lose a repeat client.   Note: there are no massage chairs for pedicures. Like the nail bar, the pedicure stations are all set up next to each other, and you'll sit on a long bench next to other guests. If the massage chair is an important part of your pedicure, go somewhere else.

After multiple mediocre experiences here, I am happy to report that I have found a nail tech I trust to provide excellent service and a fantastic mani! I exclusively see Allison when I come to Teres because she is truly the best here! Not only is she great at what she does, but she also makes me feel welcome and really changed my opinion about Teres.   After manicures with four or five other ladies (and one dude), I wasn't feeling it and didn't plan to return to Teres. A friend saw Allison and only had good things to say, so I booked an appointment with her as my "last chance." I'm glad I did! She is down-to-earth, funny and friendly. She is also insanely good at doing nails. I have seen her a few times in the last two months and I always leave very happy! Thank you Allison! See you soon!

I come here frequently to see various DJs. Monarch has the best selection of deep house artists in the Valley!! Not a super nice or upscale club, but if the music is right, does it matter?! The space isn't anything special but the sound is great and the bass is deeeep. Monarch is small but most shows aren't packed so it's fine (where my haus heads at?!).  Bar is standard, bathrooms are not great. The VIP area - I'm using the term VIP loosely here - is tiny and unremarkable, just a couple of booths and tables on a platform. You can usually find free parking on the streets close by, or keep it simple and pay $10 at the lot right across the street.  5 stars for music, sound, and dj selection. 4 stars for the actual club. Come for the music, not for the club.

Delicious!! I've been here several times and tried their sandwiches, salads, and pork belly! They smoke all their meats in house and you can taste the quality.  They have great drinks - I love the Bramble On and #ScottsdaleProblems (lol). They have a large selection of beers, too.  Every time I've gone there, the service was friendly and prompt. The menu is a bit tricky, with lots of fancy things I've never heard of, so the waiter had to explained our options and also suggested their favorites.  On a side note, this is probably not the best restaurant to take a vegetarian or vegan. Our friend only had a few options - fried brussel spouts (yum) and a couple of salads.

My parents and I took my brother here for his birthday dinner. All in all, our experience was mediocre and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. This was my first (and last) visit to any LongHorn steakhouse. The food was decent, but not the quality you expect from a good steakhouse. Our meal was certainly not worth the price we paid. If I'm spending $150+ on a meal, it better be daaang good. The restaurant was very noisy and the decorations looked tacky and cheap.  Our waitress was terrible, and I mean that in the nicest way. She wasn't personable or professional. She may have been new to the industry, or maybe she's just terrible. She sounded like a robot, reading a scripted message. We all ordered steaks and she repeated the same sentences with every order. "Blah blah, medium rare is pink with a red center, blah blah. There are risks associated with ordering undercooked meat, blah blah." Yes, we know. We heard you the other three times. We have ordered steaks before.  My biggest frustration with the waitress was when we paid for the meal. We had two visa giftcards we wanted to use before charging the rest on my credit card. I handed her the three cards and explained it. She seemed to understand but... she ended up using one visa giftcard before charging my credit card for the remaining balance. When she came back to the table, she apologized for the error but didn't offer any solution.   The highlight of the meal was dessert - the four of us ordered four different desserts (no judging, OK?!) and they were all very delicious. If I were to ever return here, I would strictly order dessert and leave as quickly as possible.  5 stars for dessert, 2 stars for food, 2 stars for ambiance, 0 stars for service.

Salut Kitchen Bar is around the corner from my work, so I come here occasionally for lunch. Great little restaurant with some unique dishes like hummus nachos (delicious) and fried quinoa fritters (also nomz). My favorite dish so far is the mushroom ravioli on the appetizer menu. It's big enough to count as lunch, very creamy and flavorful. (I am always full after eating it, but a big man might not consider it enough food.) The bruchettas are amazing - best one is the mushroom bruchetta. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, chopped salad, and pesto pasta. Everything is high-quality and tasty.      Given that I'm usually here at 11am during the week, it's pretty quiet inside. The music selection is always great - a mix of house music and electronic music! Nice Spotify playlist! I imagine that things can get loud on the weekends when you've got drunk ASU students on the patio. I like that the patio is dog-friendly and I may bring my dogs here one day.  Salut has a mailing list you can get on, where they send you text messages with coupons for free appetizers and discounts on meals.  5 stars for food and staff, 4 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for prices (can be a little expensive for lunch). They have good happy hour deals. Nice spot to take your significant other on a classy, affordable date!

I originally started coming here because it was next to my office. I live in Scottsdale so it was never convenient otherwise. A few months ago I got a new job closer to home, so I've stopped spending any time in Ahwatukee aside from AZ Tips and Toes. It is worth the 30-minute drive, I promise!   Larry and Kate have done a fantastic job with the salon. It looks and feels upscale but the prices are very reasonable. From the moment you walk in, you will be treated like a valued client. Even after one visit, they will remember your name, how you like your nails, and whatever details of your life you shared with them last time. The staff are friendly and talented at what they do. "My girl" is Dana (Vietnamese name Luon), and I am always happy with her work.   The pedicure menu ranges from classic to fancy, but even the most basic option is luxurious. They do hot stone massages with every pedicure, along with a long leg massage. The massage chairs are new and comfortable, although I wish the timer was longer than 15 minutes.   Some of the reasons why I continue to come here even though it's a 30-minute drive from my house.... Free water upon arrival and at your request, stamp card!!!, hooks to hang your purse at each station, and it doesn't stink like acetone. I've brought a few friends here, my dad, and even my boyfriend's mom! As I expected, everyone I've brought here has been impressed and happy with their manis and pedis.   I will be a returning customer as long as I live in Phoenix! Thank you Kate, Larry and Dana!!!

Such a cool store with a unique product - everything is made in Phoenix, with fabrics/supplies coming from LA. Woohoo, American made fashion!!!   When I stopped by, the owners happened to be there, so I was able to chat with them about their store and I was very impressed! The two of them take such pride in what they do, and you can really tell by the high quality of every item! They work with local designers to turn their ideas into actual clothing items. There is an emphasis on comfyness - so important in my book! The idea is to have very comfortable clothes that can be dressed up or down, depending on your mood.  Everything is trendy, yet classic. Although the items cost more than slave-labor clothing from Forever21, the quality is far superior and you can rest assured that no children were harmed in the making of the clothes. 5 stars, 5two3! Bravo!

Thank you Herman!!! So glad I found this place (via Yelp, thank you Yelpers!) as I have multiple pairs of shoes that need fixing. Herman is very talented and runs a nice little shop in Old Town. I think his teenage son was there helping with the family biz, which is always great to see.  I brought several pairs of shoes that were almost beyond repair, and he fixed them up so nicely! He put a new heel on a pair of high-heel boots, cleaned and polished a pair of brown boots, put a new zipper on a pair of tall black boots, and did a total restoration on my boyfriend's leather shoes. I dropped everything off on a Thursday afternoon and they were ready the following Thursday. Everything looked great upon pick up, but I was most impressed by the restoration of my boyfriend's shoes. Check out the before/after picture I uploaded - incredible!!  For all four pairs of shoes, I think I paid about $120. Totally worth it! I also needed new hardware for my Dooney and Bourke purse because the rivets for the long strap fell off. He was able to repair the purse on the spot for $10. So nice because I didn't want to leave it there as I use it every day.  5 stars for quality and service, 5 stars for convenience, 5 stars for prices (worth every penny!).

I have been wanting to come to the Angry Crab ever since it opened. Tons of my friends rave about this place so it was definitely on my list, but I'm rarely in the area so the opportunity just hasn't been there. Finally had the chance to come here for dinner on a Thursday night around 6pm. The restaurant was packed but we only had to wait three minutes for a table (although the waitress said the wait can be up to TWO HOURS on weekends!!! Crazy!).   Our waitress, Julie, gave us a rundown of our seafood options and how to order - pick a meat, pick your seasonings, add extra spice if you want, and select any extras/sides (corn, potatoes, etc). I got a pound of snow crab legs with the "trifecta" seasoning (Cajun seasoning, lemon, salt, and garlic) and my brother got a whole lobster with the Pacific Rim seasoning (coconut curry sauce). We opted not to get any sides, which in retrospect was a mistake. It would've been nice to have some bread or potatoes to sop up the extra sauce, and we were both still slightly hungry after we devoured the seafood. We waited about fifteen minutes before the food arrived in individual plastic bags, not plates. Presentation isn't fancy but it was delicious, delicious, delicious!!!    The overall ambiance of the restaurant was unimpressive. I am not a big fan of the graffiti all over the walls, tables, and chairs. To me, it just looks dirty and.... a little ratchet. The tables are covered in paper to help with the messiness of the meal. Our drinks were served in paper cups and we had plastic utensils (but real crab cracking tools). I understand that it's a tradeoff - affordable seafood means you don't get cloth napkins, real cutlery, and classy decor. It's not a super nice restaurant but absolutely worth it for the food and experience.  A few notes: Don't wear anything nice - you will be messy despite the bib they give you and an endless supply of napkins. They gave my brother a big rock to smash his lobster, which we both thought was hilarious. It was very effective but it would've been nice to have a "pokey" tool to help get the lobster meat out of the shell. The exterior of the restaurant is plain and unassuming, which matches the rundown plaza it's located in. This is not a good place for a first date or a new relationship... you won't have any dazzling conversation because the two of you will be busy smashing lobster shells, ripping apart crab legs, and getting covered in sauce.  $56 for a pound of crab and the lobster, with one soda on the side. Not an everyday restaurant but a great place for a fun meal and tasty seafood.

Very happy that Livewire hosted Duke Dumont and Gorgon City recently (two separate events). I had a great experience both nights! I really like that the venue has a second story, so you can take a break from the giant dancing crowd by sneaking upstairs. By positioning the "VIP" tables and booths upstairs, the dance floor below is even larger. As expected, it is super loud during the shows. Bring earplugs if you're worried/bothered.   Duke was on a Saturday and the venue was completely packed. I showed up right before he went on and everyone went crazy when it started. Awesome sound, lights and graphics. I was upset that he played such a short set - only an hour, maybe a little longer. He's only in town once a year so daaaaang, give us more (please)!!!  I showed up early for Gorgon City because I wasn't sure when they'd go on since it was a Wednesday night. The two opening artists were excellent and it was fun to watch the dance floor fill up over the course of two dj sets and two hours. By the time Gorgon came on, the venue was full and we were ready to boogie. Because it was a Wednesday, the crowd was excellent - we were all there for the music and all on the same page. Quite different from any crowd you'll find at a club on a weekend. Gorgon played for so long and just killed it with two live singers and a drummer. By far the best live show I've seen in years! Fantastic atmosphere and vibes all around.   I'm excited to see what artists Livewire will host next. Keep bringing the deep haus to Old Town, I need it, thank you!!!! (Also, some of us "haus heads" work early in the morning so please schedule the weekday shows earlier than midnight! ;) Thx!)

I love this place! Going to Lolo's is always a delicious treat for me. You can't eat fried chicken and waffles everyday, after all.   Lolo's recently relocated slightly north on Scottsdale, to a much larger and nicer space. Now an independent building, the new Lolo's features a hip indoor/outdoor bar. Although the old location served alcohol, now it feels like an attractive destination for a drink. I plan on coming here just for drinks in the future.   I ate dinner at Lolo's shortly after the move and am very pleased with the experience. Everything we ordered was amazing as expected.  The portions were huge! Our waitress was sweet and prompt with our food and drinks.   Tip: order the chicken and waffles. If you're feeling especially malnourished, add a side of mac and cheese. No matter what you order, I promise you won't leave hungry! But most importantly, don't forget the koolaid!!!!

I'm really happy that Diego Pops opened recently. I live in the area and have been looking for a Mexican restaurant that is nicer than fast food drive-thrus, but not as upscale as The Mission. Diego Pops is in a great location in Old Town and I'm really impressed with the way they've designed the restaurant. The decor is fresh and fun - everything is colorful and the place feels tropical. Parking out front is very limited, so save yourself the trouble of their tiny lot and go park behind the building.   The food deserves five stars, without a doubt. I usually order two or three tacos depending how hungry I am, and whether or not we get guacamole. (Order the guac!) They serve you chips and salsa, which aren't terrible but nothing spectacular. I like that they give you a basket with a variety of sauces (chipotle, avocado puree, salsa verde, spicy red salsa, and others), but everytime I've gone the bottles have been low. How often are they refilled... and are the sauces fresh?  My favorite tacos are the steak, pineapple pork, and grilled shrimp. Go with the recommended tortilla on each one. Maybe order two pineapple pork tacos, because they really are delicious! Sometimes I'll get fried plantains as dessert. If you've never tried them, I would suggest ordering them next time you go!  The only downside to this restaurant is the service. I've been five or six times in the last few months and some days are worse than others. The staff is nice but not very attentive... sometimes I will literally have to flag someone down to get a water refill, a napkin, or even silverware! It's frustrating because all of those things are components of good, even mediocre, restaurant service. I hope the management decides to put more emphasis on good service - it's really the only thing lacking from a great restaurant.

I am always proud to support small, locally owned businesses - and I feel even better if they are family owned. Ethereal Nails is owned by two sisters from Nigeria (if I remember correctly). Both Liz and Maria are incredibly sweet and dedicated to providing an excellent customer experience. Their nail salon is a small room located inside a larger spa/salon collective space. It is clean, free of overpowering odors, and has all the basics, and then some! They have two pedicure stations and two manicure stations. I enjoyed the smaller size of the salon because it felt like an intimate experience.  I got a gel manicure and had Liz remove two-week-old gel polish. The manicure took about 40 minutes from start to finish and I am happy with the way my nails look. My only suggestion would be to include a longer hand massage with every manicure. Those extra few minutes of pampering really make a difference! $35 for gel manicure is competitively priced to other salons in the area, but the customer service here sets Ethereal Nails apart!

Very cool store featuring lots of local products!!! Moonage Tempe is in a small strip mall across the street from Gammage. I'm not sure how long they've been open, but I hope they do well in that location! Moonage reminds me of a tiny Changing Hands, sans the books and add some vintage attire. It's a great store that fills a niche in the north Tempe area. They primarily sell jewelry, art, home decor, and clothing. I really like that they feature Arizona artists and have an emphasis on AZ/desert themed products. Way to represent the 'hood AND help our local economy!!!  I bought two necklaces made out of butterfly wings. So unique and reasonably priced at $30-something each! Jewelry starts inexpensive around $10, but there are definitely some nicer pieces with opals and other gems that can get a little pricey. Art for sale includes paintings, wood block prints, magnets, shadow boxes, and cow skulls. They have plants in plastic dinosaurs - so goofy! There were a few racks of high-quality vintage clothing.   Come here to buy gifts for your friends and fam. Don't forget to treat yourself - it's for a good cause after all! Every $1 you spend on local products... helps the economy. :D

This is one of the nicer Goodwills in Phoenix. I've been here a few times since it opened and haven't ever seen a dust bunny. I'm happy that the dressing rooms don't have piles of clothes on the floor. The entire store is clean and organized. Large selection of seasonal items; I saw tons of Halloween stuff the last time I went. Plenty of staff on the registers so lines aren't long, ever. Even on half-off Saturdays, it's easy to find an employee if you need help with something.  Don't forget to check out the jewelry case!

Found these guys on Groupon and made the plunge (hehehe) based on Yelp reviews. What an awesome scuba shop!!! Chris and Nichole are the nicest and most patient scuba instructors; Fins Up Scuba literally could not get any better! I am headed to Australia in a few weeks and wanted to get scuba certified so I can dive on the Great Barrier Reef. To be honest, I was terrified of scuba diving before going through these classes. I don't even like snorkeling, but my friend who I'm traveling with insisted that we dive on the reef. Happy to report that I am now PADI certified, and feel confident enough to get out and dive while in Australia!!!  After seeing Fins Up Scuba on Groupon, I decided to call and get more information. I had about 20 questions and Chris answered everything without missing a beat. From our initial conversation, I felt comfortable with him and confident that I would be well taken care of. I stopped by the shop to sign up for the e-learning class - it's about $20 more than the Groupon, but you can do all the learning online rather than spending an entire Saturday sitting in their classroom. There are 6 online modules to go through before you take a quick test in-person. You have to do the online modules and test before you can do your pool dives and lake dives. The package price includes all your gear rentals for all of your dives.  Fast forward to the dives - we spent an entire Sunday at a pool in East Mesa (literally 8am-5pm). There were two instructors, one dive master/instructor-in-training, and 5 students total. What a great student-teacher ratio!! You have a lots of skills to learn, and 5 short dives in the pool to practice the skills. The next weekend, we all gathered at Lake Pleasant to do our lake dives (2 on Saturday, 2 on Sunday, 4 "open water" dives total). While Lake Pleasant isn't necessarily a diver's paradise, it's such a rush to be diving for real!  I would highly recommend Fins Up Scuba to anyone who is considering scuba lessons. I could not be more impressed with Chris and Nichole and the shop that they run. They are fantastic teachers, truly passionate about their sport and they make safety a high priority. From starting as a terrified student to now being PADI certified to dive up to 60 feet, I can say with confidence that I couldn't have done it without them! Thank you Chris!!! Thank you Nichole!!!  5 stars for service, 5 stars for convenience, 5 stars for professionalism. Do yourself a favor and call them now!

Super tasty, quick Mexican food! Great to have something in the neighborhood that's nicer than FillyB's but not a $50 meal. Stick to the tacos and burritos as the enchiladas weren't spectacular. The crispy shelled tacos were delicious, especially the barbacoa and chicken tinga. They are fried to order, so super fresh and not really greasy at all. Chips and guac were on point. Save room for dessert - fried ice cream and churros! 5 stars, would return.  One complaint: the music. They were playing early 2000's heavy metal/rock. Definitely not my jam and not very welcoming.The restaurant itself lacks charm but the food is fantastic, so give it a shot! I'm hoping as they settle in, the ambiance will improve. Nonetheless, the tacos are great!

Located within the Palette Collective salon space, Kylie Borchers has done an incredible job of creating a welcoming, posh environment with Moxie Salon. I have been a client of Kylie's for years, and am so excited to see her branching out and opening her own business! Her new space oozes luxury and has a very peaceful ambiance. I want to come here just to hang out, lol. Moxie Salon is definitely a gem - don't miss it!  I shaved my head bald a few years ago, so lately my main focus is growing my hair out. For this reason, I haven't had any drastic haircuts done by Kylie, but she always provides a high-quality trim. I have been considering doing an ombre-dye, but am a little scared to take the plunge. Whenever I visit Kylie for a trim, we discuss different ombre looks, but she never pressures me to make a decision. When the time is right and I'm brave enough to try hair dye, Kylie will be my go-to gal!   Recently, Kylie started doing eyelash extensions so I just had to try it! I was nervous but ended up being so impressed by her commitment for quality! She explained the process step-by-step and showed me the difference between a good eyelash extension and a sub-par extension. Although it took almost three hours to do my full set of lashes, I was never worried about the extensions damaging my own lashes (which will definitely happen if the technician doesn't know what they're doing, or tries to rush). Kylie is so sweet and her eyelash chair is very comfortable, so it really didn't seem like three hours. It has been two weeks since I got the lash extensions, and they still look full and long! I will go back to Moxie Salon soon to get a "refill" so I can continue looking fabulous.

Cucina Cucina is super close to my office so a coworker and I stopped by for lunch. It definitely outranks all the other restaurants in the area (with the exception of the District). It's great to have something of higher caliber in walking distance. Solid 4 stars across the board.   Since the weather is so nice this time of year, we sat outside on the patio. I absolutely love the atmosphere out there - shady because it's in the shadows of the nearby sky scrapers, with the noise of the plaza's fountains keeping everything peaceful. The meal started with complimentary garlic bread and butter. Our waitress was timely which is always appreciated when out to lunch during work.   I ordered the lasagna and my coworker got the shrimp appetizer as a meal. The lasagna portion was huge, tasted fresh and filled me up. Some bites tasted slightly sweet which I didn't like, but overall it was very good. The shrimp appetizer my coworker ordered came with four jumbo shrimp, sautéed in white wine, garlic, lemon juice and tomatoes. He didn't share with me but said they were great. Being an appetizer, the portion was a little small to eat as an entree but he said it was enough food since he wasn't very hungry to begin with. We tried the creme brûlée for dessert - my favorite dessert in the world. It was good, but not great. The custard was a little too warm and tasted orange-y. I probably wouldn't order it again.   4 stars for lasagna and shrimp appetizer, 5 stars for free bread (who can say no to free food!?), 3 stars for creme brûlée. Everything on the menu looks fantastic so I will definitely be back!!!
