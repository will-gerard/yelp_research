I don't know why I thought it would be good but it's not.

Worst sushi ever. I hate when sushi looks dried out right when you get it. I wouldn't eat here if you paid me and you would have to because it costs so much.

It is not terrible but there are much better Mexican food places.

The food warrants a five star but the service was terrible! No drink refills we had to ask, no check we had to ask and no personality! Great burnt ends though!

Well I hate to disagree with the reviews on here about this place but I thought the food was sub par. I am not sure if I went on an off night but I was not impressed at all. I had monkey balls and ninja jalapenos to start and they were terribly breaded and flavorless. Next came locally named rolls that were all covered in eel sauce and were not made with quality ingredients.

Love Golden China... Granted u just know not to eat the fried rice or the chow mein noodles but the fried shrimp app and most things we have tried have been delicious. We have been five times now and loved it every time!

The waitresses are old school bitchy but not in a good way. If they were slowly more pleasant it would be a five but the food is amazing we have been about 13 times. Farmers breakfast and biscuits and gravy

Lunch today was amazing! The food is always great at Windsor but sometimes the service suffers from the scramble to find out who is actually helping. When everything is going great there is always 6 people asking if you're ok but when you need something it is always tough to find help.  The Porkwich and Curry Chicken are delightful.

Yellowtail and pig ears were good but the buzz drink and the dazed were great. Bartender was kind of an elitist but I'm over it.

Been back several times and love the food here. The only problem is getting a table, such a terrible plight for a small business:) keep up the great work

Best sauces in town! Can't go wrong with bean and cheese with crispy papas and sour cream.

Came here because the service was so slow at the bar in crudo and ended up being so happy we did.  The food is great and the ambience is better. If I open a restaurant it will be in this style because I like it so much.

Great deals after 3pm- they are way under staffed in the foh though and service suffers greatly.  Sushi is not best but I am rooting for his place to do well.

Spicy bbq sauce is delicious with chopped pork. Also the symphony fries are amazing!! The only not great thing was they were out of collard greens and the Mac and cheese was a little dry but everything else was fantastic!

Had a great lunch at this place with my fianc√©. Highlights from the menu were the Thor tots, chicken wings with sriracha honey and the krypto-dog. Server was friendly and the bartender Josh was great too. Josh apparently knows magic and is not afraid to show off his skills, when asked. We will be back for sure after the official grand opening, especially to see more magic tricks! :)  Dessert?
