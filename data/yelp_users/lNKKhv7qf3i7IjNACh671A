Yummy Japanese hole in the wall type place. Fast, friendly service, great portions of yummy food and they will customize dishes not on the menu.

If you're looking for a more traditional Chinese experience for your pallet while in a traditional American setting with actual silverware look no further. Always yummy, it's one of my favorite Chinese places.

Staff is knowledgable and friendly. They have a big space, and hold lots of comic related event, but also gaming events for RPG's and CCG's. I visited all the comic shops when I moved here from NYC looking for a new on to feed my comic addiction, and Samurai is the one that I choose as the most real.

The pharmacy here used to be amazing, but in the last six months they've screwed up my medications so often I had to get their corporate offices involved to fix my billing and get the right meds. I've moved on.

I love the karaoke on Tuesday nights. Great songs I can't find anywhere else with Amber and Kenny, Amy the bartender has awesome weekly specials and the crowd is much more hip and friendly than most other karaoke places. My boyfriend and I go weekly, and even though its not a gay bar we feel welcome and comfortable.

A great fusion of Americanized Chinese cuisine with Mexican style.

I loved this place once upon a time. It was cleaner, bigger and friendlier than it's northern parent. Been coming here for years and in the past had rated it at 5 stars.   The last few times though, it's dirtier. The staff appears to be immature high kids. The service is much worse with every trip having some kind of service failure.   Tonight I came for my birthday. At an hour before closing half the tables are covered in chairs and the place reeks of bleach. The prices are raised, but that has to happen sometimes. When our food is served it's wrong. Replacement food takes about :20 to get to us, after many patrons that arrived after the concern was raised got served and a reminder. My burrito was torn, and my quesadilla looked like a cat with a seizure prepared it. The only reason I could eat them is because they were almost completely empty.   So... in short I'm not going back. I understand raising prices, but not while simultaneously subtracting service and potion size. Bye panda, I'll miss who you were when I first met you.

I love this place. It's not something I can afford all the time, but they offer Belly for rewards and are an amazing, inexpensive treat. The flavor profiles they manage are amazing, both with cookies and cupcakes.

I've been going here for two years, but only started seeing them more than once a year to start allergy shots this past April. The actual doctors are good, not great but good enough for me not to search elsewhere. The staff however is abysmal. They regularly cancel appointments or allergy injection hours without notice, lose paperwork and in one case demanded payment and attempted to deny treatment for billing they never actually sent me.   A great example, I decided to start allergy shots in April. They were supposed to start the proces immediately, but only started the process when I follow-up with them in May wondering why I hadn't been charged for it yet. Once they ordered my serum for my allergy shots in May I was told to wait a month. In late June, 6 weeks later, I called and they said they weren't sure, they had no record of my serum yet. Then they confirmed and made my appointment to start. Which they lost when I went in. In the less then 3 months I've been getting shots the "open hours" for shots have been altered without notice 3 times.  Once I finish my allergy shots I'm leaving and never looking back.

Ok place. Flaky on special orders and overly aggressive with selling.

Dr. Sadowski and his staff are great. They are very inclusive and respectful of all families, stay up to date with current technology and best practices. For those without dental insurance they will still treat you and work out payment plans.

If you're looking for a backyard BBQ style burger like "your dad used to make" then go here. They charge more than they should, but its yummy and still cheaper than fast food if you stick to just the basic burger and fries.

Great pizza for AZ, and I love that they host a Poetry Slam every Thursday.

I'd never eaten sushi before, and this conveyer belt style was a great way to get introduced. I got to see everything available and ask questions about everything in real time rather than be force to decide from a menu. My more experianced sushi friends raved about it to.

Meh. If you're looking to experience FRIENDS without the cast and with "mood lighting" go here.

We're on a low carb diet and they were able to accommodate that. Then when my boyfriend dropped his burger out of its lettuce wrap they replaced it for free. I always loved their food, now I have to praise their service too!

I called to check how late they were open. They said 2300. I get there at 2240, the sign says they close at 2300. Their door is locked and they ignore my knocking. There are pizzas in the earners though. I call and was told they closed. When I pointed out they are supposed to still be open I'm met with attitude.   Way to win customer loyalty.

I'm not normally a fan of cart food, but these folks are great. Clean inside and out, they offer a consistently great meal with weekly specials and regulars. The staff is super friendly, knew me by name on my second visit, and even after I had been away for a few weeks.

Fun restaurant and bar. Very diverse crowd that is very accepting of the LGBT crowd too. Karaoke a few times a week is awesome with a large selection of songs. Food is good, onion rings are homemade fresh and amazing. Service is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend it, especially on karaoke nights.

We unexpectedly needed a notary for a car sale that went later than expected. He came to us within 30 minutes, was extremely professional, affordable and had a sense of humor. I recommend him highly.

We stopped in while waiting for our service at Big O to be done. It's a great "hole in the wall" Chinese place! Prices are fair, and the sheer amount of good makes it a great value. Place was a clean, and staff friendly & attentive. Would have given it a 5 but the oil the fried portions were prepared in was old and it showed in the taste. The non-fried food was awesome.

I had to ask for silverware, my beer took 8 minutes to get to me with an empty bar, my kids chocolate milk took 12 minutes. Kid couldn't stomach the Mac & Cheese, his favorite. My food was great but my kids wasn't and the service was very lack luster.
