Not impressed. My car was sent through the car was with one of the windows partially down. The interior does not seem too wet, but one of my seats was soaked. I was expecting a manager or someone to address the issue, but was never approached. The customer service is lacking at this location. This is the second shoddy experience I have had and will not return.

This nail salon is great! The new owners are present and ensure that you have a great experience. I found this nail salon by chance on Yelp and can honestly say it is now the only place in the valley I will go to.  The parking was a bit tricky (I went on a Saturday right after a big movie release). There is ample parking, but you may have a short walk. Even though it may seem a tad inconvenient, it should not sway you from the salon. The customer service was top notch. The salon was clean and felt relaxing. I was very impressed with their selection of gel polish colors.  It may have been my first visit but I am now a loyal customer!
