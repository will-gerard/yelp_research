Went with my boyfriend for an adventure day breakfast. I got a cheese danish & he got an (apple) pillow. AMAZING!!! The cheese danish was the size of my face and very tasty (as was his apple pillow that I got to try a bite of). DEFINITELY going back to try lunch sometime! And we only paid $7 for our pastries, my coffee, and his water & apple-mint drink.

Love love love love love this place! I was so impressed with their BBQ Baguette yesterday that I had to go back and see if it was a fluke since I usually can't stand faux meats. Today I had their house fried rice and it was also delicious. The best thing about LH is the fact that they sell their veg meats in the stores (along with some of their sauces and an interesting looking seasoning). So the BBQ veg protein I love so much, I now have a bag of it in my kitchen and my waitress even explained how to prepare it (it's a TVP kind of protein so you just rehydrate it).

Two words: Texas Kalaches. Haha! We also tried the Maple Bacon Donut and it was surprisingly good (I couldn't eat a whole one, but its good!). I wish it wasn't so far away, though!

In short? Great food! Bad service. However I can't look too far down on them seeing that it seems they are recently under new management & seems to be run by a little old couple. Very friendly owner! Best of all they had vegetarian pho with huge pieces of veggies and tofu. Actually if there was one complaint about the pho, it would be there was just too much going on in it! Huge chunks of bok choy, carrots, broccoli & cauliflower florets... I didn't even come close to eating it all. Pho is one of my meat-weaknesses and I can't express how happy it makes me to find a delicious veggie pho. Makes me want to move to Mesa! I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I took one star due to the lack of efficient front help.

I always love trying new bagel places... Especially if their ratings are higher than that of Chompies (which I LOVE)...   Honestly? Don't see what the hype was about... I tried a bite of my boyfriend's Reuben Omelet, which was pretty good. My scrambled eggs seemed to taste weird for some reason... I couldn't put my finger on it, but they just didn't taste good. They didn't have the bagel I wanted so I tried their cranberry bagel and it was just very chewy and bland (I didn't even taste any cranberry at all... It was just like I was eating a day-old, pink bagel). The cream cheese didn't taste very  fresh either.  I MIGHT try this place again for lunch (which they have an awfully large lunch/supper portion of the menu for being a bagel/bialy-centered eatery... I'd rather stick with Chompies or Good Egg for breakfast.

I have tattoos and I still feel like a big sissy when I come here. lol But even after my first treatment (I'm doing the brazillian & underarms), I noticed a huge difference in the thickness of hair (to the point I actually went a long time between my 1st & 2nd treatment). Went for my second treatment today and I just have to say that Heather is a saint! I had her for both treatments and she's very patient and accommodating and will even suggest that you tell her about your day to help distract you from the little snaps of pain.   Yes, it hurts. But, yes, it's also 100% worth it.

Went there for breakfast & ordered the breakfast enchiladas. They were VERY awesome! I thought it was also interesting that even though we went in for breakfast that we still got free chips & salsa from the salsa bar. Also, another 5 star worthy attribute is the fact that they serve breakfast all day long.  I enjoyed my breakfast with a refreshing large horchata. I could tell it was from a mix, but it was still very good.

My husband and I just had our wedding ceremony at TreBella who recommended Le Studio for my bridal party make-up.  Even though I made a HUGE GOOF by not telling my girls to be 15-minutes early (resulting in them all being late), everyone here was awesome and kind and STILL managed to get us out in time to go enjoy brunch in the suits before the wedding.  They told me to send anyone over if something needs fixing... Sure enough, one of my maid of honor's lashes fell off mid-picture taking!  She walked over, they fixed it quickly, and she made it back with plenty of time to take some photos during the cocktail hour.   The ONLY 'con' was that they require one card for the balance on the day of (so, no splitting) - but it's an easy fix if you just have your party pay you back (if they have no cash, there's this awesome app called CashTag that's awesome for that situation).   FYI: Extra kudos to them since I had paid the full cost of everyone's make-up and had asked them to pay their portion to them in cash (as a tip) instead of to me... Apparently in the shuffle of everything they forgot!!! So, even though they didn't get a tip (yet!) they STILL took care of my MOH! MAJOR KUDOS!

I LOVE Touch of Thai! I eat here any chance I get & I've never been disappointed with their vegetarian dishes. I haven't tried a lot of their veggie selection, but as for now my absolute favorite is #69 - Tofu Curry. Mmm mmm! I am also a huge fan of their Pad Thai and their Thai Iced Tea. Great stuff!

Had a bad day yesterday and decided my health-conscious lunch would *not* cut it as far as getting me through my work day. I've always loved VSC & have had their menu at my desk but I hadn't been in a while. Put an order together w/ some co workers & called. I was read to go pick it up, but then they told me THEY DELIVER! I don't believe they did the last time I'd been there. Went out on a limb & tried the Dead Head wrap - soooo good and WELL worth the price b/c it's huge. I almost took off a star b/c their pasta salad is NOT what it used to be. I don't know if they changed it or if they are just inconsistent in making it, but it was kind of embarrassing that I'd told my coworkers how awesome it was just to have it come out not so great.

I fell in love with the idea of Boba tea after watching an episode of Unwrapped featuring this interesting trendy drink. Then I actually found a place to try some and fell in love with the actual drink. I would go all the way into Chandler to the Lollicup and then I found this place (thanks to Yelp). I was really sad to see such a short list of milk tea options, but I took advice from a post on here and tried the taro milk tea. VERY GOOD! It was almost chocolaty tasting and the boba was very soft and perfectly sweetened. I'd love to see a better list of milk teas, though. If they had a Royal Milk Tea I would probably be even happier to permanently move my boba cravings to The Street!

Great Paht Thai! And I'm very picky about my paht thai. Also I loved the thai iced tea and the fact that they have lunch specials on the weekend that comes with soup and an egg roll. The tohm yahm soup was VERY delicious!

I actually only had their garlic knots, but I am so impressed that I gave it five stars. Why? Because I do NOT like marinara sauce. I never have. But their marinara (which is made in store) was SO good! Usually I'll just eat my garlic bread w/out any sauce, but this was fantastico! I'm not a huge pizza person, but I'll probably be seeing these guys again soon.

I don't know why I bother anymore, honestly. Their bagels are good and all but they need some quality control on their specialty coffees. I asked 3 TIMES for a hot pumpkin spice latte and not only did I still end up with it on ice (I took it as is because they were busy and I was in a hurry), but it was also disgusting. Way too sugary for adult taste, in my opinion. They need actual trained baristas. They can't even make a proper macciato.

I had the pulled chicken on the white kaiser roll w/ corn bread and baked beans...  Let me say the good first... I am *very* picky about baked beans & I LOVED these. The black beans & (I think) pieces of brat were amazing & the flavor and spicing were phenomenal. Also, I had the regular bbq sauce & I tasted a bit of the hot sauce my boyfriend ordered and loved them as well...  Now, the bad... The chicken was very bland... I'm assuming boiled b/c of the blandness in flavor & the fact that there was so much liquid on the chicken that one half of the bottom half of my kaiser roll was soaked so badly I couldn't pick it up. I had to cut it in half so I could pick up the less soggy side for eating like a sandwich & the other half I didn't even bother with the bottom of the bun (ate it with a fork while taking bites of the top half). The cornbread would have been fine if it weren't for the red peppers and corn bits... I'll admit to not being a fan of red peppers, but the corn had a really odd texture to it (like maybe they used cheap cream corn in the mix? It kept getting stuck in the tops of my teeth).   So... If you want great baked beans & bbq sauce, it's the way to go... The boyfriend ordered hotlinks & he seemed to like them fine... He also got the red beans & rice which he took one bite of & tossed the rest... The only thing we took home from all our leftovers were the baked beans.

I had the autumn spring rolls & the five spice pho. I LOVED it! I was so full I felt like my stomach would burst and I still wanted more it was so good. I've had "vegetarian" pho at another restaurant that the broth was bland and it was so overloaded with veggies it was distracting. They kept it simple with a sweet yet savory broth, veg meat (which was actually really good to my surprise), and even a vegan fish sauce. The owner (husband) was SO nice and even told me how to assemble my soup (which I already knew since I've had traditional pho many many times). The best thing is that everything on the menu is vegan (except for #31, which has egg noodles). I'm excited to go back and try some of the chef specials, they sound fantastic!

Love love love this place! I had my very first Brazilian wax after literally years of toying with the idea and always chickening out. So when I went in I was VERY nervous about it. I came in early so I could apply some No Scream Cream (which they do offer) and was offered a glass of wine while I waited. D'Lisa has such a quick-to-warm-up-to personality. Pleasantly chatty and very easy to talk to. She made the whole experience so comfortable and she even gave me an enthusiastic "you can do this!" when I was a little nervous in the beginning. By the half-way point we were chatting like buddies! She answers your questions about waxing like she DOESn't get asked the same questions every day. :) She never got annoyed by my nervousness or my questions. An awesome experience! I plan on referring as many people as I can to her services! I will definitely be back!

We went to the Phoenix Public Market just to look around since we've never gone to a farmer's market. All kinds of awesome things there, but I think the best find was the stand the Tamale Store was set up in. Not only do they not use lard in their tamales AND not only do they have vegetarian tamales, but they also have vegan tamales! Just had our first ones for supper - I got the vegan southwest tamales - with a dollop of tofutti sour cream & salsa and they are the best tamales I've ever had! The only problem I had was little bits of the paper stuck to the tamale, but it wasn't inconvenient enough to dock a star.

We usually order from Red House, but on a whim we decided to try Fusion b/c I loved their variety of tofu. I got vegetarian spring rolls, crab puffs, and orange sauce w/ tofu entree. The spring rolls and crab puffs were actually pretty good. The tofu, however... The orange sauce was different, but not bad. ... And I'm not an experienced vegetarian cook, but I do know to use firm or extra firm tofu in dishes such as these... Not silken... After marinating and cooking, it was just mush in my mouth. I couldn't even finish it because of the soggy texture.

If I could give negative stars, I would... First off, all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER, but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered. Then our orders started getting messed up (one time there was a whole burger missing) and then this girl started answering the phone to take orders that I couldn't understand and she couldn't understand me. Today I have OFFICIALLY HAD ENOUGH!!! We called in our order (keeping it as simple as possible), they have stopped carrying Mr. Pibb (which is my friend's fav) and talked to me like I was an idiot about it. FOR ONCE I was given a short & reasonable estimated delivery time... Then my phone rang and I was told that my order would have to be picked up if we still wanted it & they were under new management and will no longer be delivering to our office b/c it's too far away... Meanwhile another group JUST ordered from them on Monday! And our whole office gives them a LOT of business and they just dumped us like that? Nope... Never again...

I'm a huge fan of Lo-Lo's... Best vegetarian option has to be The CJ's (number 14 I believe - 1 waffle, 1 egg, and a small bowl of grits). And when I'm being a "bad vegetarian" I can get a southern style chicken leg as a side order. Seriously amazing grits & the southern style chicken with the waffle just can't be beat (especially if you "accidentally" get a little syrup on the perfectly seasoned chicken).

I started using Bare Escentuals two years ago and I haven't gone back! I'm actually transitioning all of my make-up to them - using up the last of some Prescriptives eyeshadow I've had for a loooong time that I love. Great customer service at this store. They know their products & will gladly show you how to use them all.

The salsa bar alone would make this place phenomenal! Our favs were the Salsa Strawberry and the Salsa Cilantro. My only advise for this place would be to just order one taco al a carte because we had so much chips due to the quality of the salsa we were stuffed. The horchata is home made and the best I've ever had! They top it with cinnamon, pecans, strawberries, & cantaloupe. It sounds weird, but it was very good. They also use extremely fresh, crisp cabbage on their tacos. It was very impressive! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder "quesa" which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good. We will be back.  My ONLY complaint is that I ordered two different tacos & got two of the same tacos... But it was still very delicious & we will go back to try anything else that sounded good.

We've been here twice for breakfast. What I love most about this place is that it is 100% Vegetarian with almost everything on the menu having the ability to be made vegan by replacing things like cheese and sour cream with a vegan option (I've never been anywhere that actually offered vegan sour cream so that was exciting!). The first time I tried the Lumber Jack - it was okay, but I think the texture of the tempeh bacon is what threw me off. I also tried their cowgirl cookie the first time and it's phenomenal! ALL of their baked goods are vegan (and some are raw/vegan). The second time we went I had their breakfast burrito w/ vegan cheese and vegan sour cream and it was excellent! Also, the teas they serve are amazing. I suggest the white peony - perfect, lightly fruity, breakfast tea. We will be back to try lunch!

I think this is the same place I went to but they recently moved to 816 S. Stapley Dr. in Mesa. I've never had fry bread before - we tried the green chili chicken deluxe style and it was SO good! Generous portion sizes (neither of us eat a lot at once compared to most people, but we both had our fill and I took home left overs). Delish!

I just have to start this review with a two-word sum-up... Not Impressed...  We were out and about & decided to try Lush due to finding a coupon/flier on our car window. Walked in & immediately overwhelmed by corniness of the decor. We requested to sit outside since it was just a lovely afternoon & it looked like they NEVER clean the seats (they were the cloth ones like by the pool or at a lounge bar).   We ordered the veggie sticks w/ ranch dipping sauce, the emulsion burger (him), and the veggie "inside out" burger (me). This place was over priced and plain... The menu is also not very descriptive. When I ordered the veggie sticks I assumed they would somehow be special. When they set down a plate of sliced jimaca , carrots, & celery I was a little disappointed. Then I thought "oh! Maybe the ranch dipping sauce is what's special"... Not in the slightest... It just tasted like plain old Kraft ranch. "Ranch Dipping Sauce" my butt...  Then the burgers came out. He said the emulsion burger was not special at all and, in fact, very bland. If they intended you to actually be able to pick up the inside out veggie burger, they were kidding themselves... It came wrapped in paper to help it hold together, but the quinoa-squash patties crumbled immediately. It was a mess to eat, I just wound up using my fork and knife for the whole thing... And it was also very bland. It tasted like the veggies in the burger were doused in italian vinaigrette. I think if they made one thick patty and put it in a bun w/ an actual good sauce instead of Kraft italian dressing, it would be gold.   Like I said. Not impressed... DEFINITELY not good enough to charge what they charge. We had the above plus I had wine (very good Chardonnay, btw) and he had a Heifewisen and it still came out to $40 bucks...  Thank God we had a buy one, get one free coupon... I doubt we'll go back.

When I dropped off my prescriptions and told them I wanted generic on both, I never thought it would be an issue... So when I went in today to get them a found that my more expensive of the two was name brand and WAY expensive, I had the refill & rebill it... Then I got home and realized they'd given me name brand on my birth control as well & the money I'd spent hadn't been for the 3 months I usually pick up but was only for one!!! I know, I should have checked... But what really clinched the 1 star rating was the fact that i got home and looked at it to see that they'd put the wrong doctor's name on my birthcontrol pills (they had my PCP and NOT my gyno who actually prescribed them)... Scary. Not going back.

Absolutely love this place. I've been going here almost every weekend for breakfast since discovering it! My personal favs are the eggs benedict (any of the different varieties they offer) and their biscuits and gravy (always ask for sausage links, too!). Today I went in for lunch and discovered they have amazing burgers as well! Get yourself a cheeseburger with cheddar and ask for some basil mayo. Best burger I've had in ages!

Tip: If you choose TreBella for your wedding, DEFINITELY go to Le Studio Salon De Beaute for nails/hair/make-up (I'll be posting that review next!)  Short Version:  Awesome people who really care about your wedding going well. Unheard of service, but in a wonderful way!  Full Spiel:  My (now official) husband and I just got married here this past Saturday, and this venue was all to thank for the wedding being a huge hit! We had the joy of occupying the Bianca & Stanza (which was also the least expensive package as we were having a small wedding anyway). We live in Portland, but wanted to get hitched in AZ as that is where we met and where most of our friends & family are. TreBella helped us so much and worked with us so well - especially considering that we didn't live in the state! They did a lot by phone and email to accommodate my busy work schedule. There was really only one miscommunication when we scheduled a visit during our holiday travels. We were under the impression that we'd be trying food and meeting the DJ, but it was just for selecting the decor options - which were adorable!!! Even though we picked the food based on description rather than getting to taste, everyone was very pleased and the food was delicious!   However, I think the thing that impressed us (and guests who noticed) the absolute most, was Kim & Mike going above and beyond for our special day. We had opted out of hiring a professional photographer. Kim took some adorable pictures of my father walking me down the isle from behind (which were shots NONE of our guests would have gotten - will share once I have them). During the reception, the DJ (Mike) actually took my camera and recorded speeches in between snapping shots of the dance floor AND taking song requests from guests while also being sure to pepper in songs from the list we'd given him of ones we wanted to hear "at some point".  For a wedding we seriously felt like we "threw together", people were impressed, amazed, and disagreed stating, "How can you call THIS 'thrown together'?"

It shocks me that I can get such amazing service one week and exactly one week later get such attitude that I never want to buy from there again (which really sucks since I'm a vegan and they are the only place I know of to get vegan cheese on pizza). One week ago I called and they were friendly and they gave me a 2 for Tuesday deal (automatically if I ordered online) and delivered to my apartment! This time I placed my order online & received a phone call stating that they didn't deliver to my area so I asked (mostly just because I was confused) about how they delivered here last week. I was placed on hold and he came back to say they could do it but said it was a busy night and to call and check first next time - which I was fine with. I wasn't rude or anything. I would have even been fine if they would have told me that they could not deliver tonight. What made me mad was the attitude... Then when they came to my door, they said (same bad attitude) "I was told to let you know that we will no longer deliver here in the future since it is out of our delivery area"... And handed me a receipt with NO 2 for Tuesday discount... First of all I asked TWO different times and BOTH girls told me I was in the delivery area and they JUST told me to call first next time & I wasn't rude or mean or anything... I'm fine with driving to them on their busy nights, ya know? Secondly, no 2 for Tuesday discount? So I feel like I got punished for something I wasn't even a jerk about...  I'm so mad I've actually decided to either go to Green for my pizza needs, find some good frozen Amy's, or just get stuff to make my own... Never getting Z's again... At least not this location.

Just an update real quick. I did email ZPizza about my experience yesterday... They have already responded and stated they would be speaking to the manager at the Scottsdale store about my experience & about the rude delivery driver. I was also asked for my mailing address for some certificates to make up for the service, which I told him I'd be more than happy to use... As long as I can use them at a different location.  I have to admit that made me a lot less angry about the whole situation because they didn't have to do that... So that DOES say something for the company in that they actually care about customers being happy enough to return for them. I thanked him and told him that their pizza really is the best. Bumped it up a star (for this location) due to the company being sympathetic to my disappointing evening.
