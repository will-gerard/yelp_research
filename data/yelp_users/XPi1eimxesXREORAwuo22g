I had even looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant and came across this little hole in the wall place! Service was a little slow but the people there were awesome explained things and were very helpful. Food was fantastic!!

The atmosphere was great! The service was extremely Slow for a First Friday night!! They had only 2 servers and a full house! Got my meal -  Ahi Tuna sandwhich and half the sandwhich was missing the tuna! Very disappointed. Posted a pic but it was deleted!

Great restaurant. I ordered the noodle beef stew but was kinda bland so I switched it or the yellow curry. Omg the curry was fantastic. Waitress was nice. No issues with switching meal either. Little pricey over but good food over all.
