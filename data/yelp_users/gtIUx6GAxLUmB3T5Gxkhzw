I honestly wouldn't "rate" this place half a star if it were an option. This is the worst place to get your car detailed. I paid 300$ for 2 car details, did the first car detail, it took them an entire 8 hours to detail my car. Dropped it off at 9:00 am and my car was not completed until 5:00pm. They said they didn't have time to complete the trunk of the car, so they didn't vaccum or shampoo it. The car afterwards smelled terrible, they didn't add any scent to the car. The seats were not shampooed, still had crumbs in the center console. I am not sure what they did they entire 8 hours.  I requested a refund for the 2nd car detail since they did such a terrible job on the first detail. They told me I could buy car washes. The servie here is terrible, Steve and Pablo promised a refund through corporate, it would take 7-10 days. On the front counter a sign reads "no cash refunds, all refunds go through corpoate and will take 7-10 days to process.  The corporate center, Tom and Alisha were unhelpful. They refused to refund my detail and offered to redo my first detail and give me a couple of free car washes... A complete waste of my time and $300.00.  I do not recommend this place to anyone. Not even for car washes. The sad thing is I purchased the two details because the employee explained how they were so slow and going out of business. I agreed to purchase the two details after empathizing with the employee. He told me about their "excellent service" and "award winning car details." Unfortunately, he lied. I feel right into it.

I really do love the food here. The breakfast is away awesome. Usually the staff and servers are wonderful. Though, when it gets busy here I wouldn't recommend waiting in line. The restaurant is very small. I went Sunday morning with my wife and they practically stacked us on top of another family's table. We were so cramped in. It was uncomfortable being so close to the people, hearing their entire conversations. When it is busy, the wait staff lacks in friendliness and great service. Although, on busy days or slow days, their food is above and beyond my expectations.

It was a ghost town. The menu was one small page, very few options for lunch or appetizers. The service here is really lacking. I went for lunch with my wife and we split a salad and an appetizer. The food was not good, the salad was only lettuce. The server was rushed and rude. We continued to have to ask the bartender for forks, ranch a refill on our water... I would not recommend this place for lunch. The reason for the 2 stars though, is the atmosphere may be fun with a group of friends to play pool and go dancing.

What a great Coffee Cafe! I love their Iced Coffee. They have baked goods, breakfast and more coffee! The environment is very comfortable, not too busy and plenty of places to sit. A perfect place to hang out. The music is fairly louder than most coffee lounges, so I would recommend it for a place to visit with family and friends. Unless of course you can tune out the music for some studying. Customer service was great and all smiling faces. Everyone seems to be very happy to be working their job. I waited 45 seconds for my drink! Great Place! Very pleased! I recommend it to everyone!

So disappointed. Rude employees. Gave me the wrong order. Refused to remake the order. Gave my wife chicken tacos instead of beef. The store was not clean. Cook had gloves on and sneezed in his hands and continued to cook. Yuck. Good salsa though. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

I visit this Dunkin' Donuts every morning. They always get my drink correct and are very consistent with the way it tastes. The customer service is good, they know me by name and I have never had any problems at this location. My favorite employee is Kable. She rocks.

This place is really great. I love the service. They spend time with you and chat with you. I really appreciated their help on explaining the health benefits and how the snow is made. I go here every now and then for a sweet treat. I have never been dissatisfied with my snow treat, nor with the happy employees. They all love their jobs and it shows!
