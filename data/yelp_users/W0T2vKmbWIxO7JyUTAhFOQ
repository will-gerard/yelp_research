This is one of the best markets that i have purchased meats at over the past 3 years, and their service is outstanding. being a MN person and knowing them from there it is great. their selections of meats and poultry are far above the rest, they are the BEST

The VIP area for St Paddy's day party was a bust for the price. Limited drinks and very limited food
