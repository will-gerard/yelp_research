My family has a lot of great memories here and that has been over 42 years now.  So needles to say it has been around for a long time and that is nice to see places still here that have great memories.  The food was really good and the music was great (just need to turn the volume down a little).  Great place to go dancing.  The service was really good too!

Awesome place.....my grandma worked here for 44 years along with my mom and Aunt. It will be sad to see this place go when they finally close the doors. So come check it out. Excellent food and service.

Always a great experience at both locations. The food is great, menu options are excellent.  If you don't want a burger they have salads.  Great toppings and they are so fresh and they have ranch as a side for dipping or adding to the bun. Love it!!!!  Oh and the RICE CRISPY TREATS are the bomb.  I always have to get at least 3 when leaving. Yum Yum.

Staff needs a little bit more customer service training.  Was asked at the door if my husband and I were celebrating anything and I said yes little early 10 year anniversary and didn't even get a congrats or happy early anniv. Then the waitress we had seemed to be in a hurry and kind of impatient with getting our order and drinks. The water is terrible and didn't even get a lemon when asked for the first time when she took or drink order. Then we get a hamburger and well....... we asked for med/med rare and we got rare....it was so much grease/juice coming out of the burger that the bottom bun was soaked and was not able to eat it.  Small amount of blue cheese.  This is the first place that we meet on a set up blind date and needless to say we won't be coming back.

This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.

The prices from the website to the menu and getting the bill are all different.  My husband got the burrito and was asked if he wanted it smothered and he said yes and come to find out afterwards that was extra and it was the same stuff that was in side the burrito.  Great place to play pool but watch out for the prices on the food and drinks.

Went to this location down from the one on McDowell to get some asthma pills and again they have cards in the slots and again they were out. TAKE THE DANG CARDS OUT when you don't have the product.

Excellent service, greeted w/a smile. Variety of food for breakfast and lunch.  You can tell they have been around a long time and the best thing is they know how to cook and treat their customers to keep having you come back. My hubby and I will diffidently be going back.

This restaurant might not be racist but they don't really treat you very nice.  If you have a Groupon.....make sure you print it because the waitress told us that they would not honor it because it was not printed. She was a little rude about it.  The manager did honor it after we asked her to ask the manager otherwise she wasn't going to.  Then when my husband and I go to pay the bill the hostess was pushy. My husband was pulling up the Groupon on his phone and she told him that she wanted the receipt, I told her that he was pulling up the groupon to give to her. Not very nice she said yes I was told about it, very pushy and inpatient.   Everything on the menu is about 9 and up. The other location on Bell is really friendly.  Don't see us going back to this location.

staff was not very friendly. They need to change the name as it is not just a Gyro place, they serve hot dogs and hamburgers and the fries were terrible.  Nothing fancy about them like the other Gyros places I have been too.  Once you got your food and if there was no one else the staff all disappeared. Will not be returning.  The food was just okay nothing that makes you go wow.

Nothing like getting a massage from a student who is learning and helping them out.  They have deals every now and then 2 for the price of one and their daily price is just $25.00.  Come prepared to wait though as it could be anywhere from a hr to two hrs.  My hubby has never had one and he is going this weekend. I just hope he enjoys it as much as I do.  Nice and relaxing. :)

Very friendly staff and ready to help with a smile.  They have a better quantity of things on hand and the prices are a lot better than Sports Authority. Sad thing is that they are getting rid of the bowling section and will be closing it out.  My hubby and I just started bowling together and for the price or rental of shoes it is better to buy your own and then to make sure they have your size of bowling ball is to get your own also.  Will be shopping more at Dicks for our sports needs for bikes, camping, and weights.

It is always a pleasant to go in and be greeted that they will be right with you if they are helping someone else.  They take the time to give you informed of anything while putting new tires on or getting them rotated if something does not look right.  They never try to sell you up on things when you tell them how much you can spend.  Everyone is very professional and great service.

The food and service is good. Nice selection of sandwich's and salads.  The only complaint is that when they run out of something to let the person know at the register know so it isn't a surprise when you get your food.  Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.

Always friendly and great food but the person working the last window through the drive-through messed up....he just gave me my order and didn't repeat back what it was and seemed in a hurry to do something else than take the time for the customer at the drive-through. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.

My parents took their truck in to get the tint replaced and Danny took really good care of them. Advised that it would be better and cooler if they did all the windows. They took his advise and boy is it nice now in his truck.  They are going to go back and get the truck detailed. The customer service was awesome and if it wasn't for other great reviews they would have went elsewhere. So thank you Danny for taking care of my parents we will be coming back. Plus they guarantee their work.

Excellent service every time I go to this place.  I have been going there for over a year and half now and I even took my mom and she said that they did an excellent job on her pedicure. Even if my family go to get theirs done at another place I will wait until I can come here.  It is so nice to go in and they know you and know exactly what you want done.  All the ladies there are very pleasant.
