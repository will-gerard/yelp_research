From the front office to each doctor this place is amazing. I couldn't walk when I first got in. Within 10 visits I'm 100%. I've had back problems my entire life and push my back to the limit with crossfit. Didn't matter, he got it to where I need to be.   I haven't been in over 2 weeks and still have zero pain. Many doctors fix things temporarily, Dr. Justin fixed me for the long haul.   A++ across the board

POOR PEOPLE BE AWARE!!!   You're thought is, I can't afford anywhere else and arrow will approve me. There is a reason why.   Damon will steal your money, harass you through email and charge you for things you have no clue about. In 1 year he charged me $1200 in fees. I was never late on rent once . He allows you to use a web portal to pay rent that doesn't work at all. I paid my rent had confirmation and a bank statement to prove it. I will still charged $300 in fees and another $500 for "evection process". I think had to pay all of that and rent again, in return I was never given my first payment back..   This guy specializes in using "the law" to steal from poor people and trick them into the most insane situations. I don't care how good of a deal you think you're getting, he will turn it on you and steal from you. There is always something behind the "too good to be true" listings and credit check he does.   If I had free time I would spend 8 hours a day trying to ruin his reputation. The good reviews on here and clearly his friends, nobody in their right mind would give a guy who refuses to answer a call a 5 star. Not only that, he will only email you when he is trying to fine you.   I have been emailing Damon for the past 14 days asking where my deposit was sent too and the answer I got 1 times was "it was sent to the last known address".. What does that even mean? Does that mean you sent the deposit to the rental I lived at prior to moving into his property? I ask 11 times for the specific address he sent it to and finally got an email telling me how dumb I was and that he told me several times "last known address".   RUN RUN RUN AND RUN EVEN FASTER AFTER THAT

Hands down the best supplement store I've even been too. From pricing to customer service this place is top notch. I've lived in multiple states and experienced several great mom and pop shops. Compared to GNC and other franchises they're always better priced.   Firebird blows everyone of them out of the water. Not only that, they match online pricing as well.
