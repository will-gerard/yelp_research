I have been sitting in this establishment for 30 minutes. I used to work in the same plaza and have never had service like this, well im getting no service so maybe I shouldnt compare. I came here a year ago with a friend with crazy tattoos and was treated horribly too. I saw both bartenders talk about me and then go to every table but mine. Maybe I need an oxygen tank or handlebar mustache to get a menu here. This is ridiculous,  no wonder this shit hole has 3 tables full and thats even a surprise to me. Too bad I have a party of 10 coming that im now telling to go down the street to jj Madisons for karaoke.

I had to replace my back sliding glass door after my dog had an accident and smashed it. (He's a big dog, and didn't get a scratch). I called around, and this place said they could have my door replaced by the following day. I was able to bring my frame to them and pick up from them instead of having a technician come in, which is a plus that saved me like $200. When the frame was brought in they were actually able fix it that same day! Excellent, fast customer service. AND my door was only $115 when others quoted me $175+. I probably just had the standard basic glass door, but they seem reasonably priced.

Mmmm...this place is good. I love their orange chicken. Good prices and the people are super friendly. Anything with shrimp in it is great.

While I'm sure this doctor is knowledgeable in his field, he's not that great with his bedside manner. My first time meeting him, he gave me a huge lecture about me taking anti-anxiety medication, which was prescribed a month earlier-that I hated anyways.. He never talked to me about it, just ridiculed me and told me to do yoga. Really? He doesn't keep track of what he tells patients, and what he goes over at each visit- and he uses the electronic medical records which makes it easier.           The last and final visit, I show up about 10 min before my appointment. I had to wait for 45 minutes with no apology or explanation. After being brought back to the room, I can hear him outside the room with his staff talking about his black Friday shopping for 10 min! So weird, and so over it. See someone that actually cares.

I noticed that someone on here reviewed my tattoo and that's how she found the artist to do hers! Ha-ha, that's awesome. Justin has done 2 of my tattoos, I guess you would consider it a half-sleeve. I love both of them! By far the best work I've had done ( I have 7). He has a great portfolio and so do all of his co-workers. My brother had a piece started my one guy. He ended up leaving, and I think Neil finished it and did an amazing job. The front desk, Samantha, is extremely friendly. Love this place! The cost is reasonable. It's not the cheapest, but they don't rip you off. I'm pretty sure Justin has a degree of some sort in art and has won several awards. For the quality of work that they do, it's worth the price for sure. Cheap tattoos look cheap!

I'm a fan of this location. For the most part, the staff greet you when you walk in (the signal butte gym they didn't even look at you), it's pretty clean (I think), and it's close to home. They have a good variety of classes that give you a pretty good workout. My only complaint is that the director of the classes is ALWAYS 15 min late to teach class which is super annoying. But, even though she is never on time, she will kick your butt. I take my son to the dayacare here, and the ladies that work there are all really nice. They remember my son's name and always gives him a sticker when we leave. They seem very attentive. The body works instructor (I think her name is Jolene) is awesome!

Meh, it was ok. Customer service lacked. Went to place my order and I got to the pizza and he quickly said 15 min, and then walked and came back and I ordered the fried mushrooms which were ok. Overall, the price was decent, $18.50 for a large and an appetizer. It's close to my house, but don't know if I'd go back. Maybe on a lunch break..

This place is amazing! The best hummus, falafel, Greek salads, gyros, pretty much whatever you order. Customer service is excellent too. Random place in Apache Junction, well worth the stop.

Audra is awesome! She's fast and makes the experience as painless as possible. I think I also saw Christie also, and she did a good job too. The front desk wasn't so great when I first started going, but their customer service seems better. Their prices are a great deal too.

I wish there was a place like this in Denver where I live, but when I'm in Mesa I have every intention of stopping here, I just don't always get time. I got the peanut butter bowl and it was really good. I was there about 3 weeks ago but from what I remember they had a decent selection of acai bowls of goodness. I remember peanut butter, banana, granola and whatever else was in it was so good. It's a somewhat healthy alternative when you want something sweet.

I was surprised by all the good reviews. Just don't do it..  The food was really not good. I tried a little bit of everything and the only thing that was decent was the mushrooms from the chicken and mushrooms dish- but there was no chicken.. It was weird.  Maybe we were too close to closing time (around 7:30- I didn't think it was that close), but the food did look like it had been sitting out for a while.

Whoever was driving your white company van east bound on the 60 today was driving crazy, almost hit my car- used no signaling at all, please be careful out there

Seriously, this girl is amazing..  I've known her for 6 years as her hair stylist, and now I'm lucky to call her my colleague, and my go to for my waxing needs. She would always tell me about how passionate she was about her career and it's the truth. Her customer service skills are amazing. It impressed me that she goes above and beyond to make her clients happy, and they all love her. She's had specialty training in brow waxing, and I've seen how she consults with the client through the process to make them comfortable, and gives them great advice because she is very knowledgeable.  She has waxed my brows once, and they looked great. She also waxed my lip (don't judge) and I didn't break out from it. I also had her give me a Brazilian wax, which can be an awkward experience. She was very quick (10 minutes tops for me) and it really wasn't that painful. I didn't feel burned or bruised afterwards at all- which has happened in the past.  Erika is a genuinely kind, caring and exceptional person too. Go support this hard working gal- definitely see her for your brows and bikini!
