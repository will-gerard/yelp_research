My husband and I have chosen Palm Glenn for several years now. We have two cats and one dog. They have been able to see us right away when an emergency arrises. They provide great routine care for our pets as well. The doctors and staff are always considerate and listen to any questions we have. They are reasonable in their pricing and explain everything thoroughly. Also, they have a new groomer named Tori who is the only groomer I have found thus far that grooms our dog exactly as requested. I would suggest Tori for any dog grooming needs you have.

I have had a very frustrating experience with this doctor's office. The hold times on the phone are atrocious. I have been left on hold for 20-40 minutes or more several times. They do not even apologize for the wait time when they return on the line. Also, the wait time to see the doctor exceeds 45-60 minutes each time. I always arrive on time and end up waiting far too long. Furthermore, they are slow to refill prescriptions that the pharmacy faxes to them for approval. Therefore, I spend each month without my medication for a few days, causing insomnia and hassle with the doctors office monthly. I am currently looking for a new doctor and would never suggest anyone go here for their medical needs. I have been extremely dissatisfied with this medical practice.

I have been to many shops all over the valley for vape accessories, batteries, and e-cig juice. This is not conveniently located to my home, but I make the drive anyway because their juice is the best and have referred some friends there whom were very happy as well. They have the best juice in the valley, hands down, great selection. Their flavors are not overly sweet which is what I like best. Great customer service, great products!

I went here to see Emily Claire, who has been my hair stylist for over a year now. The salon has a great modern feel (without being pretentious). Everyone who works here seems to really enjoy working at the salon and to love their jobs in general. Oh, and the salon chairs are super comfortable, which is a huge added bonus...  As for Emily Claire, I could rave about her all day! I have extremely fine hair that requires an absolute expert to color, treat, and cut correctly. Emily offers suggestions, while listening to what I am wanting to achieve and pulls it off every time. She discusses and explains what she is doing before hand and also educates me as to how to best take care of my hair at home. Emily has also never pushed the sale of hair products which I also really appreciate. She is a true professional with a warm and genuine personality. Because of her, I get regular compliments on my color and always leave the salon feeling beautiful!
