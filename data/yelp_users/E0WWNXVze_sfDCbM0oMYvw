What do you want CPK to do, back flips when you stroll in for lunch?   Mix things up a little, how?  You dont see Applebees or Olive Garden "mixing it up," do you?  No, because its a chain and one is exactly like another, the food is the same, the place is set up the same.   This is the nature of the chain restaurant beast, so if you dont like it, still to pricey Old Town or NoSco trendy hotspots.  Nothing wrong with either one, just know what you like and what youre getting yourself into.  I'm not quite sure where my rant and thus love for CPK has come from, except that every time I go, I have a good experience.  Food comes out fast (I always have the margerita pizza), service is quick(they know how to handle a large lunch crowd) and overall, everything is consistently good.    So they dont have a circus performing for your lunchtime entertainment.  I dont think they need it.

Grab your rich boyfriend and make him take you to Capital Grille.    The food is FANTASTIC...I had filet mignon and believe it or not the mac and cheese side is to DIE for.  The wine selection is incredibly extensive but our waiter knew exactly what would go well with our dinners.  Dessert was a must too here, we had creme brulee and some raspberry thing that almost sent me into extacsy.  As other reviews have stated, CP is pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for.    Parking is easy, located at the Biltmore they have valet but its not usually entirely necessary.    Service was prompt and polite and everyone is extremely buttoned-up.  A great place for celebrating a special occasion or just feeling fancy.

Wow do I hate Old Navy.  The commercials make me want to slit my wrists.  They have the most awful colored clothing ever.  Colors I didnt even know exisited.  And it seems like they only ever have stuff in sizes 12-24.  TWENTY-FOUR??  Holy crap.    They do have extra long wife-beaters so I'll give them that, but again, in some real alien colors.  And the normal colors they are always out of.  The checkout line is run by some dumb ass high school kid who cant figure out the register and the line for returns wraps around the store.  I dont have time for this!!!  ARG.

Bleh.    Our service was pretty bad...food took forever to come out, waiter got our drinks wrong and was overall unattentive.    Once the food finally arrived it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I had the cobb salad and my friend had the chicken sandwhich, both pretty average, although portions were big.    Note that you have to order sides like fries seperate--which annoys me.  Cheesy decorations...blah blah blah

If you think the drive from Scottsdale to Ahwatukee is a bit of a hike, try it with a screaming cat in your passenger seat.    Toby (my little feline friend) is not a road tripper.  He hates his crate, hates the car, and apprently really hates the new Kanye West album because not even my favorite Chicago-born rapper could calm my furry friend down.  So he growled and meowed and ran his face into the gate of his crate for the 25 minutes to Warner and 51st street.  You would think I should spare myself the drama and find a new vet closer to home but I just cant.  I've fallen in love with the staff at ACVH, as well as the facility.  Everyone is so nice and greets both me and Toby by name, even when I come in alone to pick up food and hang out with the adoptable animals.    Today we wrestled ourselves in and chatted it up with Tammy and Lauren before we met Heather in the exam room.  Everyone was great, they even humor me and do the shots and everything in the back so I dont have to see Toby pout.  (SHUT UP SO I LIKE CATS, SO WHAT)  Dr. Elliot is fantastic, very knowledgeable and super loving to Toby.   I'm not sure what average prices at a vet are these days but I didnt break the bank so I suppose thats good enough for me.  Also very clean.  Sucks to have to con my 4 legged love back into the crate and the car in 3 weeks to have his teeth cleaned, but at least I know once hes there hes in tender, loving hands.

Located on the southwest corner of Broadway and Lindsey in Mesa, this little mom and pop diner is the perfect breakfast place.  Its SUPER cheap and quick and the people are always welcoming and friendly.    My favorite is the "giant breakfast" with eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of meat and toast.    I've had lunch here too, the burgers yes, are giant, and delicious.

I went to Crabby Don's before AZ went smoke-free and it was miserable. So the only reason  I'm giving this crap hole two stars is based on the highly unlikely possibility that now that none of the metalheads in there can blow smoke in my face, that it might be a little more cool.  But its doubtful.  Ah metalheads...not my kind of person.  Sorry.  Not my kind of music either.  So freaking loud you cant hear your friends literally screaming in your ear over the screaming metalheads.  Annoying.  Bathrooms were filthy and there was a girl snorting coke off the sink.  Have some tact metalheads.    This place sucked, even for Gilbert.

I am seriously craving those little toasts with the two kinds of spreadable cheese they bring you before your meal at Flemmings right now.  DEAR GOD do you think you can get that to go?  I have had a fantastic experience every time I've been to Flemmings.  Great, sophisticated atmosphere with waiters who know their food and their wine.  Great wine selection, btw.    I always have the filet there and its always cooked to perfection, along with the asparagus and blue cheese mashed potatos...holy crap--DELISH.    Great upscale date place...I've also seen groups handled well here too.

Sakana is a great alternative to the RAs and Stingrays of Scottsdale.    Tucked in the Indian Bend/Hayden plaza, this place is a little less well known and has quite a bit better food than being right in Old Town.  You miss a bit of the trendiness of being in the center of it all, but that warrants perks like dressing down (flip flops and t-shirts are totally acceptable here) and paying less.  Check out their daily specials for the best deals.  Lunchtime also has some hidden gems.    Service here has always been good and the food is flawless.

Thank GOD they opened a Lowe's by me.  I doubt you'll ever find me in a HD again.    I have never felt so dumb as when I was forced into Home Depot the other day.  Just because I look like I have no busines being in a hardware store, doesnt mean that I have no business being in a hardware store.  I have money to spend dammit!!  Cut me some freaking slack.    I had to search high and low for a "friendly sales representative" who was stick-up-their-ass crabby at best, and watch them look at me like a moron when I asked what aisle a laser level would be in.  I'm no Tim-the-Toolman-Taylor but I think thats a pretty common item.  QUIT LOOKING AT ME LIKE I SHOULD BE AT A BAR SOMEWHERE AND SHOW ME THE LEVEL AISLE.  I also needed help carrying a huge ceiling fan out of the store.  This is not unreasonable but the clerk and helper-guy looked completely put out.  You work at HOME DEPOT you jerks, lend an effing hand.    The only reason this crap shoot gets 2 stars is because its always pretty clean, its has a boat load of stuff if you know where to look, and the worker's uniforms are all a lovely matching orange.  Thats it.

Love love LOVE Fox Sports Grill.  Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.    Belly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.    There are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.    DJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.    Prices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.    Be sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team.

I love the Melting Pot.  Its not somewhere I'd go daily or anything but once in a relationship (or once every 6 months to a year, whichever comes first) I do enjoy being taken there.    I like going to the Melting Pot on a date as opposed to with a group because its much more intimate to feed just one person a chocolate dipped strawberry than it is to try to feed 10.  Sticks cross and that can just be uncomfortable.    Make reservations always as it tends to get busy, as request a private table where you are separated from the rest of the restaurant by a curtain for a more intimate vibe.  No one needs to see what you're doing back there with cheese and marshmallows (not in the same course) and whatnot.    I like the fondue for two, which includes 3 courses and a salad I believe, but come hungry because its a ton of food.  The wine selection is good and drinks are typically pretty strong.  Prices are higher than other places but for the ambiance and uniqueness of the food, and the quality of service, etc, I think its just about right for a special night out.

I *heart* Nellos.  Whatever location, the food seems to be consistently great, and if you've read my review of the Old Town location you know that my heart really belongs there at that location.    Things that I dont like about this McClintock and Southern spot:  1.  Service last time I was ther BLEW.  We sat at the bar because there wasnt anywhere else to sit and we were in a hurry.  Big mistake, it took us over an hour to get out of there.  The bartender was doing about 4 different jobs, none of which was attending to the people at the bar.  And this was just lunchtime.   2.  Its not decorated as nicely.  Call me crazy, but it matters.  3.  In Old Town you can walk outside and enjoy some of the shops, bars and people scenery while this location is in a strip mall.  Boring.  All in all, still a great place to eat, just not as entertaining or as impressive as the Scottsdale one.

God Bless Lifetime Fitness.  First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.    However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate?  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.  First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES?  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.  Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love that?  You never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.  My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.     Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!    I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway??  Win-win situation.

I've been getting my nails done since I was a junior in high school and if you dont know me, you're going to have to take my word for it thats its been more than a few years since then.  So I know what I'm talking about when I rate this nail joint 5 stars.    I live about 20-25 minutes away from their Elliot/Kyrene loation but its worth the gas out there.  I always know exactly what I'm getting.  Theres hardly ever a wait and the staff is super friendly.  They are of Taiwanese decent I believe but they dont sit there talking trash about you the entire time, which is hard to come by I feel like.    Their pedicure stations are complete with spa style massage chairs, their waxing room is impecably clean, and their pink and whites get me compliments weeks after I get them done.    Prices are comparable if not on the low side of the scale.    Ask for Ken or Jenny and tell them Emily sent ya.  You'll be taken good care of.

I love the Biltmore. Now, if I only had the money to shop there. Sure, there are some more averaged priced places...Macy's, Borders, MAC, Pottery Barn, but most of them are truely top shelf retail establishments.  Gucci, Saks, This Little Piggy Wears Cotton, Tommy Bahama, Betsy Johnson, etc line this outdoor shopping layout.    My favorite part is that on Fridays (at least they used to do this, havent been on a Friday in a while), they have an open air market in the middle of all the shops complete with fresh fruits and vegtables, and hand crafted gifts.    During the summer an outdoor mall is a bit intimidating but once it dips below 100 degrees, this up scale shopping experience is much more than just browsing for new shoes.

Sluggos is a great Mesa sports bar with a Chicago theme.  The perfect place to grab a drink with your already wasted Cubby buddies after a spring training game since the field is just blocks away from the bar.    Decent bar food (I like the wings and chicken fingers...see a theme? cluck cluck) and a juke box so you can pick your own tunes.  Friendly staff and a bunch of regulars who will make you feel at home right away.    Kind of tricky to find so mapquest the address before you waste time driving around Mesa.

I was totally creeped out by El Charro when I first went in there.  Super dark (like, you seriously cant see in there for about 5 minutes when you first walk in and are literally blinded by the AZ sun when you come back out), cold, and at the time SERIOUSLY smoky (but not anymore).  Its very small and cave-like, but dont let the weird ambiance deter you from trying this mexican joint.  I always have the cheese tea, which is just a cheese quesadilla so I dont know why they have this odd name...  They also have the mexican cheese tea which is filled with cheese and beef.  Its lathered in butter so be prepared to hit the gym afterwards, but its worth it.  The burritos are good too, and surprisingly I hear they make an exceptional cheeseburger.   Be forewarned, El Charro closes for three months in the summer, so call for open hours.

Mesa's best kept secret, LJ's is a family owned pizza joint with I swear to you, the best pizza I've ever had, EVER.  And I know my pizza.  Seems simple I guess but they do it right and I'm not sure I can really explain it.  Regular to thinnish crust, not overbearing on sauce...  Dont go to LJs for the ambiance, theres not much to be had, but the service is good and you absolutely cant go wrong with the endless pizza and salad lunch buffet for around $8.  My favorite is 'shroom, but for you daredevil pizza eaters, look for tens of odd topping combinations including the pasta pizza.  If you HAVE to be in Mesa, you HAVE to be at LJ's.

China China is your typical chinese food joint.  It delivers, which I love, because I have a weakness for lazy Sundays, or you can dine in.  The restaurant itself is clean and the waitstaff is always polite.    Favorite dishes are the orange chicken and the won-ton soup...not the most daring chinese ever but it never fails me!  Note that when calling for take-out, 99% of the time the food takes longer than they say its going to.  I've also had slower service inside, not bad, just a little on the taking-their-sweet-time side.  So be sure youre not rushed when headed to China China.

I effing LOVE TBC.  Located smack dab in the middle of "the scene" its truely the best breakfast place in town.  Apparently its the thing to do to actually shower and change from the night before prior to arriving so you can watch the rest of us stumble in looking like hell.  Whatever.  While you wait for a table (and you WILL wait for a table), sit outside on the patio and people watch some of Scottsdale's finest.    The Breakfast club isnt all about being the "it" place to be though, its also about the food.  Those of you who just came from the gym might want to try the egg white veggie omelet or the best oatmeal this side of the Mississip...  Those of us nursing a killer hangover might stick to the cinnamon challah french toast, benedict-style eggs, or belgian waffles...  You'll never want your loser boyfriend to make you breakfast in bed again.  Lunch at TBC is round two of fabulousness.  Salads, sandwiches, sweet potato fries...  I'm suddenly starving.  Dont let the line or the wave of D&G sunglasses outside deter you from waiting for the best meal of the week at the Breakfast Club.

Everybody likes Dos.  I've found its the first place anyone from out of town is taken because its the prefect entry level Scottsdale bar.  While you'll find some really good looking people really dressed up, for the most part, this is one of Old Town's more laid back nighttime hangouts.  Imported friends arent scared off by pretentious club-goers, instead they are welcomed with obnoxious open arms and peanut shells on the floor.    Drinks are cheap (Coronas are always just $2, mixed drinks are $6 and up) and the food is tolerable when you're a bit buzzed up.  Bar Mexican food is always a nice finale to 12 or so margaritas, thats what I always say.  Dos is known as a "great place to day drink" and it is that too.  Grab a stool on the patio and youre sure to make friends with someone, the gringos here are all pretty friendly.    The "dance floor" (search your way through the crowd to the upstairs back balcony to find it...its small) is always packed at night, and the music aims to please.    Day or night, local or foreign, everyone seems to have a good time at Dos Gringos.

So they serve food after 2am?  So does Denny's.  And Whataburger.  And at Denny's they dont make you sit on some sick ass counch that has god knows what on it from its better days at Sigma Chi.  Everyone that has sat on those couches should go get tested immediately.  Are you all so drunk when making the decision to stumble to Mickey's that you dont realize how disgusting it is?  And that you've just PAID COVER to get in there??  What is this cover for?  Obviously not new couches.  Or more bathrooms.  Two bathrooms with one room each doesnt cut it for me.  Because then I have to wait in line to pee, thinking about how I just paid $5 to stand in line and look at ugly people sitting on splooge covered couches.    Drink specials and the patio when its not 130 degrees might be appealing if the rest of this nightmare wasnt so fresh in my mind.

I have never sweat so much as I have when I go to the dance floor at Suede.  Everyone is literally on top of each other and usually too drunk to notice, so if youre not in that frame of mind yet, I recommend that you head out to the patio and start shooting whatever "that guy" is buying.    Suedes got a cool atmosphere inside and out, especially if you can go on a night where you can actually see whats what, and has great food if you can get in before the masses take over.  They play hip hop after 11 on the weekends, theres cover for guys and not girls, and a dresscode as well.  Drinks are pricey but average for Scottsdale, watch out for doubles of Grey Goose.    Standard Scottsdale bar...  Good times.

I believe I got a very good facial from the misters at Roaring Fork.  My hair also got a little frizzy and my date walked out with literally wet shoulders.  Out of control!!  TURN DOWN YOUR MISTERS!!    Whew ok.    My mister rant was the only issue I had with Roaring Fork at all.  Aside from being slightly damp when we left, our overall experience there was great.  We sat outside on the patio which is decorated pretty cool, white lights line the trees, etc.    My date had the tortilla soup, which he raved about, and a chef's special, lamb.  He loved everything including Moose Drool beer which not a lot of restaurants serve.  I had the salmon with mushrooms which was perfect.    Great food and service, nice atmosphere.  Reservations recommended, we had them and had absolutely not trouble being seated.  Good date spot.

You know the Soup Nazi, now meet Joe, the Pizza Nazi.    Dude, it was your choice to open a pizza joint in the middle of the second most pretentious city known to man and keep it open til the wee hours of the night, not mine.  Learn some tolerance.    Get drunk enough to ignore Joe before you get in there (which most people do without realizing it anyway) and stumble into Joe's after the bar.  Its open late and has the best pizza in town.    Thin, huge slices with all the regular fixin's...  Oh and garlic bread knots with ranch and marinara.  Its all ready to go so theres not a wait once you actually get in there...and what line there is outside usually moves pretty fast.    I have no idea what the prices are because I'm either too drunk to notice or the chach in front of me didnt realize that he just paid for mine.  You taking notes here?    Just remember to keep your orders to the point and be polite when you get to the front of the line....they may not let you use the bathroom (and you know you'll have to go) if you dont.  :)

Perhaps it really is all about a name.  When Maloney's changed to Mulligan's a bit ago, something happened over there on Stetson that simply cannot be explained.  Its the same damn bar, the same layout, the same movie clips, the same horribly small bathrooms.  And how, HOW is there an effing BATHROOM attendant in the men's bathroom??  The room is about the size of a closet for starters, and there isnt one in the ladies room.  Oh wait, maybe there is...  Regardless, the bathroom situation is miserable, which yes, has always been the case but there are a few changes that came with the name change of the bar.  I really liked Maloney's.  It was a total frat-house bar, with a 3-1 guy girl ratio (just the way I like it) with a serious amount of beer spilling and car bomb shooting.  If you were friends with a bartender (or just happened to recognize her from last night at Kona) you could get $100 worth of drink for $7.  That kind of deal makes anyone look past the ugly guy grinding on your leg over by the dance floor.  Music was always good, old school hip hop and popular more recent stuff.  Maloney's may have been packed but the crowd was generally good looking, recent college grads, doing what they do best.  Get really really hammered.    However I was there last weekend and something was seriously wrong.  The bar didnt get even remotely busy until later, which would have been fine but the talent there left something to be desired.  The bathroom still sucks and the music isnt as good.  I've heard their happy hour is two-for-one so whenever that is might be a better time to go than after 11pm.  I doubt I'll find myself there again at any hour.  Bummer...

Buca Di Beppo is a chain restaurant and for that I dock a star, but they do have great Itailian food.  Everything is family style so dont be surprised when the prices look high, almost every portion serves between 2 and 5 people.  I went on a business dinner with 8 of us and service was great.  Since they are used to handling big groups of people, our orders were nothing new.  Nice to be able to have a good meal with lots of people and finally not complain about the service.  Decent wine selection, tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere.

Awesome AWESOME atmosphere.  Especially when its not an inferno outside on their patio...surrounded by chili pepper lights and a small creek complete with foot bridge and tiki-ish bar...  Carlsbad Tavern is one of my favorite spots.  I love sitting outside but as it really was an inferno when I was there last week, I had to get aquainted with the inside bar area.  Not much different, chili pepper lights and New Mexico license plates... excellent music and good vibe all around.    Spending most of my early 20s in the Midwest, I hadnt had a whole ton of New Mexican food before but let me tell you, I am now a whole hearted fan.  Lots of green chile menu items, burritos, enchiladas...  My recent favorites are the crab stuffed green chiles, and the carlsbad chicken salad.  HUGE portions so bring your apetite.    Prices are average but great for the amount of food you get...between $8 and $25 for steaks etc.  Perfect service, friendly staff.  Dont forget to try a prickly pear margarita--best in town!!

Oh I'm totally crazy about Zipps.  Its a great place to watch the game, grab some grub for happy hour, or day drink outside on Sundays.    For happy hour, they have different deals every day, inclduing both drink and food items.  A personal favorite is the monaco foccacia--a chicken, cheese and ranch foccacia wrap with a mild jalapeno sauce on the side.  With fries and/or onion rings, this is the perfect hangover meal.    We used to frequent Zipps on Sundays when you can get a bucket of beer for $10 (5 Bud Lights, what a steal), sit outside, watch football and play cards.  Fine, we're nerds, but I'm telling you, its the perfect ending to a weekend of debauchery.    Theres a ton of TVs (although not as big as some other bars) and service is good.  On game day, arrive early to be able to seat your whole party--or for those who want a more hands-on sports experience, try out the 2 shuffle board and pool tables.    Morning, afternoon or night, Zipps is a great place.

Any bar thats within stumblijg distance to my house is okay by me.  I've always passed on Panksters Too because its in a strip mall and sounds like some sort of prank/joke store to me.  So when my Nebraska friends wanted to watch the game there yesterday, I was excited to try someplace new.  The inside is bigger than it looks outside, and basically its your typical sports bar.  Good (big) TVs and plently of seating, especially since the place was barely half full, and a shuffle board table which I love.    You could walk in here in your pajamas and no one would care, which is great, but at the same time there wouldnt be anyone in there that you'd want to impress, so take that for what its worth.    Pitchers were cheap, food was good bar food (we had the chicken nachos...HUGE portion for about $8) and my other friends really liked their wings and quesadillas.    Plenty of seating for me and my 20 closest football fan friends, a great alternative to the more popular (and thus PACKED and pricey) Scottsdale sports bars.

I drove by the Coach House Tuesday morning at 6am on my way to pick up my car from Old Town (another story), and there were people sitting outside boozing like college kids on Saturday night.  This is the scene every day, as many 3rd shifters come to tip a few back after work, while the rest of us are walk-of-shaming it home.    God Bless this weird place.    I once saw a 60 year old man plow his Harley into the side of the white picket fence that seperates CH from the rest of society and almost lost a leg.  Me, not him.  I dont think he would have felt it if he had lost his leg anyway.  It was great.  It was also still light out.  Super strong drinks from Hans on the patio and a bill worthy of small town northern Michigan (read: cheap as hell), this "scottsdale dive" as another reviewer wrote, is just my cup of tea.    Tacky christmas decor inside, digital jukebox, huge patio, and the kind of people-watching that can only be found at CH, this Indian School and Goldwater bar is perfect for any drinking occasion--day, night or latenight.  You can even stop in after you grab your car in the morning.  ;)

RA is a sushi place for rookies.  Not that thats a bad thing, my first sushi experience, like so many other midwest transplants, was here, with the oh-so-daring California roll.  Now, I'd like to think of myself as a much more knowledgeable sushi fan, graduated long ago from the ranks of RA.  Thats not to say that I dont still like to pop in for happy hour from time to time (although their happy hour menu isnt too impressive...the only rolls being spicy tuna and the cali roll) or better yet, reverse happy hour on Sunday nights.  The greater Old Town population has been to RHH at RA at least a handful of times and will continue to go back regardless of how skinny the rolls are.  Why?  Because everyones doing it.  And because of the cheap saki bombs.  And because of the hot wait staff.  Hey, I call a spade a spade.    Ge there early to avoid a hellacious wait or to grab a seat at the bar and watch the rookies roll in.  No pun intended.

Kyoto does a good job of doing what it does.  That being said, if you've been to one Kyoto, you've been to them all.    Tepanaki (you know what I'm trying to spell here dont you?) tables, the Japanese dude lighting onion towers on fire on the table in front of you...taking pictures to put on your birthday mug...yes, its all the same.  But its all good.  Delicious actually.  Never a bad meal have I eaten at Kyoto.    Never have I not waited in a line as long as the nile either.  "But I have reservations!"  They dont care.  Tell Lisa-Lipgloss to hurry her sweet cheeks up because they wont seat any of you until shes there.  Pony up to the bar for some savory (and surprisingly super cheap) saki bombs while you wait, and you'll forget you actually came to eat.  If you still have an urge to eat, do it right and get both sushi and a tepan-cooked meal...you'll be impressed and its not overpriced, you get a ton of food.  Bring your appetite, patience and your valet money and roll through Kyoto...the annoyances are worth your weight in sushi.

If its good enough for Britney, its good enough for me.  Which I guess isnt saying much these days...  But trashy ole Brit knew what she was doing when she booked a room at Sanctuary.    This resort truely is a Sanctuary--the pool, complete with negative edge, in-water matching rafts for guests, and a top notch waitstaff was my favorite spot.  Had a gotten a chance to experience the spa, which I've heard is one of the best in town, I may have taken up residence there.  I stayed here as a reward for work with a bunch of girls--we had a suite--a sweet suit eactually, complete with 3 bedrooms, kitchen living room, etc.  We even had a cute bellboy who watched parts of the NBA finals with us.  Now thats service.    Plush robes, a balcony with a perfect mountain view, and egyptian cotton sheets.  Loveitloveit.  At night we went to Elements which is the very up-scale restaurant and bar at the resort.  It deserves its own review so I'll write a seperate one, but know that its exceptional and the view is amazing.  A great date spot for even those who aren't spending the night at the hotel.

A huge patio AND half off all bottles of wine on Tuesday nights?! Lunacy.  If this place wasnt so damn far from my house, I would spend every evening overlooking the mountains enjoying this place. Its a bit hidden at 105th St and McDowell Mountain Ranch Rd so let up on the peddle, lead foot, and dont miss the strip mall on the southwest corner where you'll spot CP.  Food is excellent and the waitstaff is friendly.  Great atmosphere for a date too.  Ask about monthly wine tastings (I recommend the Chalone Pinot Noir) and specific hours...they are not currently open for lunch that I know of.

I've only been to On The Rocks once but had a good time considering what I was going for.  I met a few friends for a low-key night at a bar where we would know no one.  Enter, On The Rocks.    Between Thomas and McDowell on the east side of Scottsdale road, this strip mall bar has no rules.  Its very chill, with a few local faithfuls at the bar.  We were over dressed but no one minded, everyone pretty much kept to themselves.  I think there are some video games in the back, but we occupied ourselves with the shuffle board table which was a blast.  Super cheap drinks are also a blast.  Definitely a rougher crowd than you'll see elsewhere in Scottsdale but not intimidating or rude.  A great place to go wearing flips and a t-shirt or if you want to leave the house and not give a shit about anything.

When I get a craving for Chinese, I get take out from New China Gate.   Its close by, delivery is quick and the food is consistently delish.  I've only ever been inside for pickup, but its clean and the people are friendly.  Cant eve4r go wrong with the wonton soup, crab wontons moo goo gai pan.  Feeling devilsih?  Try the gang pang chicken.  I've never tried it but I swear its on the menu and gets me thinking every time.

The key to Defalcos is calling IN your order before arriving.  This place is awesome but its SWAMPED at lunch time.  You'll end up eating your lunch for dinner if you dont plan accordingly.    They make fresh sandwhiches and salads and I've never had an "off" meal there.  Try something Itialian...its what they do best, my favorite its the meatball sub.  Also the antipasto salad ranks right on up there.  In the grocery section, you'll find specialty items to take home... homemade pastas, spices etc.  Delicious!!

Be sure to call in your order at Dilly's if youre going for lunch.  Its packed every weekday and you do end up waiting for a bit.   But its a good atmosphere if you have to wait, Tempe business folks and college students alike enjoy meals here.  There is seating outside and inside is always clean.    I really like Dill's sandwhiches and soups...quality ingredients (Boar's Head meat) and awesome bread.  Although I will say the bread outweighs the insides of the sandwhich usually, and that annoys me.  I go for extra meat and cheese and take half home, but thats just me.

Nice little place - professional, detailed and kind. Weird part of town in the Food City shopping plaza but don't let that deter you. I was welcomed, seated and given a bottle of water right away. The reason I left the nail salon I've been loyal to for over 5 years is their work started to decline when they started watering down their polish and hurrying through the service. Snow is great though - new colors that are obviously not diluted and a vast selection. No customers talking loudly on cell phones either. A nice experience and very reasonably priced - I paid $22 for a pedicure. Not a luxury spa but I don't need that, it's clean and they do a wonderful job. I will definitely be coming back.

To give any gynecologist five stars is major. Going to this type of doctor is a nightmare on so many levels for any woman but I can't speak highly enough about Dr Eich. I've been coming to him for years for a few reasons: He is calm and professional. He is gentle and knowledgable. More than that even, he is thorough and SPEEDY. Get in, get the eff out of there, that's what I'm thinking and that's exactly what he does. Thanks for making an all-around uncomfortable situation truly painless :)

So the guys are a little older.  What dont you people understand about free drinks?  I walked into this place on Friday night and was offered a shot of patron before I even got through the entry.    God Bless Barcelona.    This place has been reviewed so much so I'll stick to the basics:  Its huge. Lots of comfortable couches/tables/standing room. Dance floor thats really really packed. Cover band.  Think Zowie Bowie but lame.   OldER crowd, but not creepy-old and not too-poor-to-buy-girls-a-drink old.   Great table/bottle/VIP service AWESOME, spacious, asthetically pleasing, modern bathrooms with an attendant.  No lines. No cover for girls, $10 for dudes.  In summary, aside from the really bad band (if you can even call them that, they just sig over popular music...music that I like, but the singers are so cheesy and weird it freaks me out), I loved Barcelona.  Definitely worth the 15 minute road trip north from Old Town.

Two words: Happy Hour.  Quite the scene, Sapporo seems to fill up before it opens.  The place doesnt open til 4pm and by quarter to 5 there arent any tables or seats at the bar.  And thats where you want to be (the bar area or outside) to have the best view of the North Scottsdale after work crowd.  And believe me, its a sight to be seen.  Even on off nights Sapporo is a great place to people watch.    During happy hour, drinks are half off so you wont feel bad throwing back that $11 martini (or 5) and their HH sushi and appetizer list is extensive.  Defintely eat there too because those martinis are stronger than they taste.  They have a blended mango one that I adore.  Their sushi rolls are decent but nothing to write home about, but the calamari is great.  I've only done happy hour there and I truely believe thats the way to go, espeically now that I've read the other reviews on people's mediocre dinner experiences.

Ah, Devil's.  The perfect combination of Scottsdale snobby mixed with drunken, shameless debauchery.  I love this bar.  Let me tell you why.  A)  The Girls bathroom.  God bless it, there are at least 10 stalls, each with seperate full length doors, and a bathroom attendant in the main part.  A giant full length mirror, plenty of sinks and enough hair spray to get you through the night and all of the next day too.  The line?  It moves fast and you can watch the boys while you wait.    B)  I have never ever been sober here.  Drinks are average for Scottsdale but for some reason they just TASTE better at Devils. Especially during HH on Thursdays or before 10 (I THINK) on Fridays where its two-for-one.  If you leave here sober, its your own fault.    C)  The crowd.  Yes, its crowded...with people I LOVE.  Devil's goers arent pretentious like the ones you'd find scoffing at everyone at Six or Dirty Pretty, they are all there for the same thing--to get bombed and make out with someone.  And theres nothing wrong with that.  Girls (and some bonehead guys from out of town) dance on a handful of platforms on the dance floor, but there are also two other rooms to flirt your way through.  The ceiling opens up when its not a billion degrees out and its fairly easy to reserve a table and get bottle service for those nights youre feeling VIP.    D) The music doesnt suck.  E)  Girls dont pay cover, and guys dont pay before 10.  If you cant afford ten freaking dollars to get into a bar, guys, you shouldnt be in Scottsdale.  Its as simple as that.  Even the hell hole that is Mickey's Hangover charges $5 to get in...girls included.  WTF?    F)  No matter how drunk you get and how stupid you act, there is someone whos more drunk and more stupid.  And no one cares because everyones a drunken idiot and we've all been there.    Want a Scottsdale scene without the judgemental BS?  Come play at Devil's.

People dont go to AZ88  for the service, so get over it if youre impatient waiting for a drink or your food.  Enjoy the trendy ambience or venture to the bathroom for entertainment.  Take your pick from the "He," "She," or "S/He" bathrooms.  Yes, this restuarant/bar moonlights as a gay hangout but who cares.  No one in Scottsdale apparently because word has spread even through the heterosexual community that this is a great hangout.  SUPER strong drinks, casual atmosphere despite the trendy attitude, and great American cusine make for the perfect combo.    My favorite is the AZ88 chicken sandwhich, which is a spicy chicken with blue cheese on a bun with the best waffle fries EVER.  You can also get it as a salad if youre feeling skinny.    The staff isnt the most friendly or the most prompt so put your patient pants on and suck down a drink while you wait.  You'll forget what youre waiting for.    Food is served latenight and you can walk around the park by the civic center afterwards...  Great date spot.

This Oreganos (like any other actually) would get 5 stars if it wasnt for the wait.    The parking sucks (try behind Salty Senorita next door) and the line wraps around thie building usually.  But once inside, service is stellar and the food is delicious.    My favorite is the white pizza, with no red sauce, tomotoes and basil....mmmm.  MUST have the bazookie or whatever its called here--the giant half baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream...literally the best dessert on the planet.    Dress is casual, great for entertaining out of town family members.

Somehow, everyone who has even flown through PHX has set foot in Axis or Radius at some point.  Recently transplanted newbies appear to REALLY like to bring their out-of-towner friends here to impress them because obviously, Cincinnati has never and will never see anything like this madhouse.  This is true.  And 'natti is better off for it.  One word: overrated.  And heres why:  Theres always a suuuper long line.   You have to pay cover. House music. Expensive drinks. Douche-y dudes in leather pants. Extra bitchy girls.  God, I dont know, I just hate the vibe in here.  I mean, I guess if youre trying for over-the-top, we're-not-in-Kansas anymore, check-out-how-VIP-I-am-now-that-I-live-in-Scottsdale, this could be your desintation for a night.

A few words on PCL:  You are GOING to get your drink spilled on you.  You are GOING to overpay for your drinks.  You are GOING to get groped by random dudes on the dance floor.  You are GOING to wait in line for the bathroom and while you do, you will more than likely see a girlfight outside of it and watch two lunatic girls get hauled out of the bar, one with a broken nose and one with a bloody face.  Or maybe that was the same girl.  Swear to you I saw this exact scene at this exact bathroom line twice in a row.    If the girl fight isnt enough to make you want to brave the scene (or the line outside) at PCL, you should know a few other things:  People watching is top of the line here.  Everyone seems to be black-out drunk and on top of each other by midnight.  8 girls are trying to pile on the swing and 2 others are trying their luck on the pole, coming inches from splitting their heads open on the floor below.  Wait for it.....   One day.  Fingers crossed.    The guy that groped you is more than likely pretty damn hot.  And if youre black out drunk, even if hes not, he will sure look hot to you!    If you can bring a big enough group, do the VIP thing and keep pretty well lubed up with booze, you wont mind your new vodka soda infused Sevens or the fact that Chachi just grabbed your boob.  Again.

I never thought I'd say it but dammit, I have jungle fever.    Pita Jungle actually makes healthy food taste good, which I didnt think was possible.  I usually go for some sort of chicken wrap, which comes with a salad, etc etc...  The hummus is also a staple in my PJ diet.  Cant go wrong with the caprese salad too.    Service is something I think could be better...  The waitstaff is all pretty granola-y, which I have nothing against, but they dont so much hustle as they do shuffle around.  If you know what I mean,  No?  Go see for yourself.  But get there early, you'll usually wait a bit.

Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.    Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.    If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.

Molly Brannigans is a huge addition to the Val Vista/Baseline block.  I've been for happy hour a few times and as a main bar to hang out at night once or twice.  No, Mesa/Gilbert is not my typical hangout which is why this place doesnt get 5 stars...its not by my house and the clientele is decent but not super-great.    The outside patio is great when its not firey-hot out and the inside has a great Irish-pub atmosphere without the smoke and grime.    Good, classic Irish comfort food paired with good, classic Irish comfort booze.  Happy Hour prices are decent but they do end early so plan accordingly.  I've never sat anywhere but the bar, but have always had good service from cute bartenders.  Cant argue with that.    Cheers.

Gelato is the new black.  It goes with everything and makes you feel skinnier than regular ice cream.  Which is why I can justify eating it almost every day.    The fruit flavors are even sugar free (or is it fat free?  Whatever) so you can enjoy gelato without the guilt of DQ.  My staple favorites are the cookies n cream, snickers (ok so shannon and I go together once in a while), mint chocolate chip, and the oatmeal rasin.  Trust me.    Despite popular belief (and all joking aside) The "G" Spot isnt as hard to find as some people think.  And you'll never want to leave once you get there.

Jackrabbit was the perfect place to host tryouts for the Lingerie Bowl last Saturday.  My first time in there, my 20 closest friends and I had a great time until it got so ridiculously, insanely packed.  ASU is now back in session so I'm thinking thats why literally ever bar I set foot in that night was a madhouse.  But if Jackrabbit is always this full, I dont see myself going back.    Drinks seemed par for Scottsdale ($10+ each), as was the bar in general.  Set up a lot like PCL, its basically a big room where everyone stands around playing grab-ass with flirty co-eds.  Want to pick the people who grab your ass?  Opt for one of the VIP booths on the sides of the dance floor and you'll feel less like youre in a meat market.  But not entirely.  Cover was a pricey $20 for guys the night I went and ladies are free always I believe.  The burlesque dancers every hour were a night change from the amatures on platforms at Devils or the go-go girls at Axis.

Who's taking me to Ocean Club?  Anyone?  Holy Crap I was there last night for the first time and just had a few drinks at the bar with friends.  DEAR GOD if the food is anywhere near half as good as it smelled....  And I've heard that it is.  Extremely pricey and the bar was packed.  A little rowdy too for the age group there, definitely an older crowd...lots of cougar hunting going on by my 20-something guy friends.  Definitely more of a scene than, say, Capital Grille...louder, etc.  Loved the decor and the music (they had some dude singing but it wasnt obnoxious), not to mention the bathrooms are impecable and huge.    I only wish I could give a review on the food but like I said, we didnt eat...  *sigh*  Maybe one day....

Blah.  This place bores the shit out of me and every time I go, I get more annoyed that I just spent an hour of my life there.  Its never by choice, obviously the Patron has a few faithful fans but I have yet to find the fun at Loco.  Next door to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant right on Scottsdale Rd, this patio is usually pretty packed.  Which adds to my frustration.  Everyone is smooshed onto this gated in patio, talking about how much they hate the bar.  What, like there arent a dozen other places to go to within 20 feet?  The bar took forever with our drinks and I felt like the bartenders were talking trash about patrons.  Youre not cooler than us except for the fact that youre making money at this dump instead of spending it.    Speaking of drinks, I havent ever had a great one (read: "great"=strong) and prices are just like every other place like this.  Food is mediocre and I usually try not to eat just so everyone can tell how much I dispise it here.    Never have I met someone fun or worth knowing here, and since I can make friends with a doorknob, this is a serious statement.  Happy Hour?  Dinner?  People watching?  Youre Loco.

ATTENTION MICHIGAN/MICHIGAN STATE FANS!!!  Owned by a Michigan native, UD is the BEST place to watch any Michigan sport.  College to professional, if its being broadcast, it will be on at Upper Deck.  Both the Michigan and Michigan State alumni clubs meet there for football games in the fall, and Pistons, Tigers and even the occasional Lions fan line the walls the rest of the year.    Two levels, great seating and a million TVs...  Good promotions (Finlandia and Miller Lite are there a lot) and give-a-ways frequently take place.  Two bathrooms and theres usually never a line at either.    You'll find yourself screaming fight songs and meeting friends from your alma mater.  "YOU vacation on Glen Lake??  SO DO I!!!!"  Holy crap its just like being at home...without all the snow and misery.  The ONLY reason I didnt give this bar 5 stars (sorry Tom) is because of the service.  I REALLY hope its better this year because last year it was pretty horrific.  Just not enough staff to support such nutty, starving, THIRSTY, wasted, midwest football fans.  Food is bar food...burgers, wings, fries, etc.  Order early, you'll thank me for it.

Are you stalking me?  Heres a hint: I'm not at Myst.  Ever.  The crowd is too young (think ASU's entire Greek scene), too wasted (think puke-your-face-off drunk) and too retarded (think OHMYGOD we SO just got into a club and were only NINTEEN!!).    I freaking hate this clucterfuck.    House music is not my thing, watching underage girls snort coke in the bathroom is not my thing, and fighting through people who are under the false impression that they are cooler than me is not my thing.    They have world-renowned DJs in there every once in a while and a pretty decent chance of celebrity sightings which brings Myst to a whopping 2 stars.

For some reason, not every bar in town offers Sangria.  Enter My Big Fat Greek.  Sangria here is good and in fact, I got really drunk off some chocolate martinis there a few weeks ago too.  Nearly forgot about that.  Aside from booze, My Big Fat Greek has great food IMO.  I really like the chicken salad or the chicken pita.  The hummus is also always a great starter.    I've always had attentive service and like the general Greek vibe I get when I eat here.  Casual atmosphere, great for lunch or for dinner.  Good location in Old Town next to many shops and bars.  Highly recommended!

Four Stars.  Based on the hope that its not as smoky as it was when I went (before the AZ no smoking law went into effect) and the fact that if live music in a small venue is your thing (which its not for me), then you'll like it.  I saw a VERY heavy metal band here as a favor to a friend and I think I was deaf for 3 days afterward.  But again, if thats your idea of a good time, have at it.  I'm not one to judge.  Hahahahaha.  Thats a lie.  Anyway, drinks were cheap and the place is a lot bigger than the strip mall its in would make it appear.  I thought the clientele was weird but what do I know about this shit--apparently not much.    Other friends of mine have been more recently than me and have LOVED it--its a Nebraska bar and, they say, a great place to watch the game Saturday mornings.  To each his own!

I've lived in the midwest so I know what a great concert venue is supposed to be like, and its not Cricket.    If its 110 degrees outside (which it almost always is, if not hotter in the summer months) its 125 degrees in and around Cricket.  The acoustics are horrible, you cant hear anything anyone says if youre out on the lawn.  Parking and leaving is a total disater, I've had to wait in that parking lot for over an hour to get out.  And if all that wasnt bad enough, you'll go broke buying drinks.    If you want to be sweated on by a total stranger, you'll love Cricket Pavillion.

The Skeptical Chymist is a great North Scottsdale bar for happy hour or dinner/drinks before going out.    I went a few weeks ago with a group of friends where we did just that.  We all bellied up to the bar which probably wasnt the most ideal spot for the 12 of us but the rest of the tables were full so we made do.  The bartender was really attentive and the food came out quickly.  My friend and I split the chicken tenders which, in true Irish fashion, are extremely battered but equally delicious.    Music was probably louder than it actually needed to be, it was pretty hard to hear anything anyone was saying when the live band played, but when the playlist came on, the volume was just about right.    Fun time had by all, different, tad older crowd than I'm used to, and it was a nice change of pace.  I'd definitely go back.

CFC (or Chandler Fashion Center for those of you not reading my mind) IS the Scottsdale mall, in Chandler.  Meaning that it has most of the same stores, just smaller and chalk FULL of kids.    I honestly think that little play area upstairs by the bookstore breeds children.  They keep popping out of there, like, if youre not careful, you will probably come out with two more kids than you went in with.  MUST strollers be supersized??  I cant get my oversized Coach bag around your three screaming kids in your giant stroller.  God.  Enough of my rants.  Aside from the under 12 population, CFC is a fine shopping complex.  Macy's, Nordstrom...that other one that no one goes to....  Express, White House Black Market, Abercrombie, Gap, Limited, The Buckle, BeBe, Guess, Arden B, Vickie's, Pottery Barn for your 16 rugrat kids you just strolled in with, Williams Sonoma, American Eagle, Toni and Guy, Kona Grill, a movie theater, Paradise Bakery....you get the picture.    Not as much product as some of the other valley malls but if you can get past the minors, you can park and get in and out faster than it is to wait in the valet line at Scottsdale Fashion Square.

Everyone loves the 'Ho.  And why wouldnt we?  Past reviews say it all...  Valley Ho is a total scene.  If youre not comfortable with yourself, dont dare to venture here, youre bound to be slitting your wrists before happy hour.  Its my own insecurity that gives this place 4 of 5 stars I'm sure...  Beautiful people line this trendy pool--many Scottsdale residents in for birthday pool parties and a close-to-the-bar room to stumble home to.    Rooms are spacious and modern, flat screen TVs, bold colors, very shiek.  We got food from whatever bar is at the hotel but were too drunk to remember eating or paying for it so I wont review that aspect.  Just know that munchies are available, plus drinks, although I'm not sure why you wouldnt bring your own.  A room poolside is definitely the way to go.    Crunch out a few situps and jog over to the Valley Ho...hundreds of Ho-goers each weekend cant be wrong.

I believe Hungry Howies was started in Michigan, which is close to my heart, so already this little pop-in-and-pick-up pizza joint rates high on my list.  Free flavored crust, all the regular pizza toppings, wings, cheese bread, calzones, salads...HH has it all.    Not a dine-in restuarant, you'll want to have this pie delivered or have your bf pick it up.    I've never had a bad meal from here, or waited longer than normal to have it delivered.  Always friendly highschool/college kids working the counter, clean, accurate with orders.  Who can ask for more from a pizza place?

The Monastery is unlike anywhere you've probably been before.  Natalie's description gives a great idea...  Almost the whole thing is outside, with large sand volleyball courts, outdoor grills where you cook your own food (purchase it seasoned and ready to go there), swings, fire pits, etc.  I like it in the winter when its nice enough during the day to play volleyball then cool enough at night to bundle up in a hoodie and pretend youre at a bonfire.  I also like it when the near-professional near-naked volleyball boys come to play on Friday nights.  I just appreciate good sports.    The only thing I dont like about the Monastery is how many people bring their kids.  Thats really just because I'm not a fan of them at all right now, so dont take it personally.  The place is actually pretty well set-up for kids and I guess if they werent so annoying in general, it would be a decent scene for them.  There is a sectioned off sand area for them with toys and stuff yet of course they run amock...grrrrr....  Whatever.  Dont expect a Scottsdale crowd at all, this Mesa bar is just that--a place to kick back and relax with friends.  Change is good my friends.

I hesitate to write a review about this theater because I seriously dont want anyone to know about it.  In fact, I would give it 5 stars but I dont want people to go there.  A good movie theater is hard to come by (Pavillions on Indian Bend??  Sick.  That one in Mesa by the mall??  Kill me)  but Cinemark has done it right.    Sure, the teenagers working the popcorn machine are a little slow, but arent they all?  And you wont mind the short line when you get a taste of this popcorn straight from heaven.  There is some sort of magic powder on there (quit thinking that) and it is to DIE FOR.    The place is clean, the workers know how to work a freaking ticket machine (so the kids at the theater on Shea didnt train them) and the seats inside are comfortable.  Never a problem with sound or picture quality, or even obnoxious patrons.    Who knew such a cinema haven existed??

A see-and-be-seen tanning joint?  Of course!  Why not?!    For those of us unfortunate enough not to have a trust fund (yes, there are a few folks in town) and to have to work during prime sunning hours, there is Darque Tan.    Convienently located across the street from LA Fitness on Scottsdale and McDowell, you too can be a part of the gym-then-tanning or tannning-then-gym crowd.    This is a mostly membership situation, where you are either a member, and pay a lot, or you arent a member and pay a ton.  Actually, I think their monthly membership prices, while a tad steep (since you still pay each time you tan anyway unless youre in a level 1 bed), are still very comparable to other local tanners.    I'm already confusing myself on pricing.  Alicia put it best, they know what theyre talking about, give 'em a call.  The lobby, bathrooms and beds are always spotless, front desk and cleaning staff is friendly and efficient, and their beds work really well.  They have both regular beds, stand-ups and spray tanning so you can fry away to your hearts content.    Everyone needs a tan in Arizona, especially if you want to look skinnier than you are.  And who doesnt want that?  If you cant make it to the pool every weekend and lake is just out of reach, Darque Tan is your new best friend.

I was elated when I saw the new Nellos go up in Old Town.  If you like Nellos anywhere else in the valley and havent been to OT, race your pretty little face over there tonight.  For salad.   I too am not a huge fan of their pizza and I cant put my finger on exactly why but I think it has something to do with the sauce...  Just not what I get excited about.  But the upgraded garlic bread with cheese and tomatos paired with their amazing and very generous spinach salad...now there is a food worthy of blowing your diet over.  The atmosphere at this location in particular is better than the others, plus its in Old Town so less screaming children means more happy hour fun for you and me.  Rumor has it they have live music there sometimes too.  Parkings a bitch at high traffic hours but isnt it at any OT hotspot?  Get over it or road trip it up to Shea or down to Tempe for other fine locations.

Oh how I would live at Scottsdale Jean Co if it werent for the INSANELY high prices.  I am a designer jean whore so I dont mind paying $150-$200 (even though many of their pants top 200 big ones) for a pair of Rock N Republics but $250 for a SHIRT?  I definitely felt out of my league.  More power to you if you can afford to drop that kind of cash on a bar shirt you'll wear twice but I cant and I'm jealous of you.  Blinged out belts and Kiehl's beauty products are also available here.    Staff is a little over excited to help you pick out your new $235 bar shirt but everyone is friendly and ready to help.

Who doesnt love telling people that they are "staying late at the office tonight?"  You'll definitely want to stay late at The Office on 116th st. and Shea more than once.  The food is excellent...I recommend their HUGE burgers or for a lighter meal, the caprese salad.  Reasonable prices and a great sporty atmosphere add to this bars appeal.    Definitely an older (30+) crowd, this isnt your run of the mill old town sports bar.  You might actually get a drink bought for you here--hooray!  Aside from the drive from OT, which is about 15-20 mins, you will love the childless, chill atmosphere that is The Office.

Ah, the freeway.  Right effing there, like, on the patio.  I'm thinking perhaps the restuarant came before the freeway, otherwise this was just poor planning.    Nevertheless, Earl's is a good place.  Its huge, for one, and is asthetically pleasing, both inside and out.  Giant bar with lots of premium liquid, and drink specials suited for the time of year (think pink drinks for cancer awareness month, peppermint whathaveyous for Christmas).  Great wine selection too.    I did find it kind of annoying though since my bf and I sat on the patio (complete with Range Rover/Escalade parade) where there was no happy hour.  NO HAPPY HOUR.  What?  Only in the lounge inside does happy hour reside.  Doesnt make me happy.    Extensive menu though and large portions...I had the portobellini sandwhich which had great flavor, and the bf had the club...but you can have your choice of everything from sushi rolls to steak and everything in between.  Fantastic service...good relaxing vibe.

Did I hear that Dirty Pretty and PCL have the same owner?  SHOCKING because its the exact same people, doing the same stuff, with slightly different bathrooms, a few blocks down the road .  I even think some of the bartenders are the same.  Am I wrong?  I'm not complaining, since I actually like PCL well enough.  I ventured into DP right when it first opened, so I'm hoping they have grown into themselves a bit since I've been in.  When I was there, the DJ was effing AWESOME...  I couldnt get enough of his 80s rock/current hip hop beats, but then hed switch up to something like Sublime.  Now, dont get me wrong, I do like modern rock but not when everyones attempting to dance to hip hop.  People dont know what to do with themselves.  And thats a lot of what happened on the dance floor the night I was there.  A lot of standing around and looking at people.  PCL anyone?  hehe  Clientele is Scottsdale snobby which I do appreciate, with a mix of randoms...but like I said, maybe that was just in the first month or so,  maybe recently others have filtered themselves out of DP and back to Dos.      They have a photo booth towards the back of the bar, which I think is a freaking great idea...  Even though we all have digitals, theres something about paying $5 for below par photos of you and the hot guy from Minnesota you've been making out with all night.  Again, am I wrong?  I am not.  The women's bathroom says "bitch" on it.  HIGH-larious.  Loveitloveit.    Rock out with your cock out at Dirty Pretty.

They open the doors for you when you walk in.  More polite than most of your ex-boyfriends I'm sure.  Yes, it might feel a little bit like Sorority Rush when you walk in, everyone smiling and at least 5 "Hi!! Welcome to Fox and Hound!!"s...but you'll like it, and dammit, you'll want to pledge the house of Hound.    I'm getting off track.    Fox and Hound has a bar/restaurant feel so you can go for lunch, which is my fav, or for dinner and drinks happy hour style.  For every 5 lunches you buy, you get your 6th one free--what a deal!  Especially since usually you have to buy 20 bagel sandwhiches to get a free dog bagel or something at the place up the street.  Are you following me?  The menu is nicely priced, you can fill 'er up for about $10 for lunch and $12-$15 for dinner if youre not having drinks.  American Bar Food is the cuisine--chicken fingers, burgers, salads...the occasional comfort food when they pretend to have an irish pub feel.    We've always had great service there...waitstaff is friendly and the manager always comes by to say hello and be sure things were good.  If youre down near Baseline and Cooper (Stapley), drop in to see our friends at F&H.

Vegas on Labor Day weekend?  You MUST be VIP.  And were we ever.  A friend of mine knew the one of the clubs promoters and we were in like mother effing flynn.  Which was a good thing since the bar was PACKED the instant it opened Saturday night, the night after trashy Brit grand-opened this bitch.  Aside from the prices of the drinks (is SIXTEEN DOLLARS par for Vegas?  I miss my cheap $10 Scottsdale drinks *pout*), this was the most fun I had all weekend.  Well, from what I remember.  We made friends with boys who had a VERRRY private room upstairs chalk full of Grey Goose, prepartied up there then made our way to the dance floor.  Moved on to another VIP table right on the outskirts of the dancing hooches (yes my friends can bump and grind with the best of 'em) and had court side seats to the best entertainment in Vegas.  Debauchery!  Dancing on rails (so unlike me...hehe), PDA, and I think I even saw another reviewers' puker in the corner.    Get drunk enough to deal with the crowd and you'll have a blast at LAX.

Sweet baby jesus my A/C was on the fritz today.  I was taking my afternoon nap when I got a text from my roommate, who was coincidently napping in the room next door, telling me that he thought the AC was failing us.  I groggily stumbled out of my cave to find that yes, the thermostat was rapidly surpassing 80....   Called the A/C guy who couldnt come for another 2 hours or so, so I pulled on some pants and raced down to Lowe's.    I frantically flew into the store and was surprisingly greeted by someone who actually knew where the AC filters were.  Since mine hadnt been changed in a good 6 months or so (what??  I'm a girl I dont know these useless things), I figured a new filter was the place to start.  I found the filter right where the greeter said it would be, and raced to the checkout.  No line!  NO LINE!!!  And someone actually pleasant to help me.  What is this place called?!  NOT Home Depot, thats for sure!  The check out guy, Sam, reassured me that AC was actually pretty easily fixed and that it probably just needed freeon (frion? free-on? frie-ohn?) but that yes, I had picked out a great set of filters.  Why thank you Sam!!  I left having one of the best experiences of my hardware store shopping career.  And yes, now my AC is fixed.  Back to being pantsless.

I'm a little embarassed to admit that I've only been to The Well at about 9am on a Tuesday.  But I guess thats what some people do, especially this clientele.    The Well opens at 6am and doesnt close until 2am every day but Sunday (when hours are 10am to 2am) and there are people in there every minute in between.  Pool, darts, and cheap drinks make this place a south Scottsdale bar worth checking out any time of the day.    Everyone is SUPER chill here, and while food isnt served, the crowd I was with actually ordered pizza in.  This isnt normal, but this isnt your normal Scottsdale bar.    Its a little tricky to locate, so mapquest before you go, or if you remember the old M3 bar, its in that very same spot.

This store is a freaking Nebraska WAREHOUSE!  The largest selection of Nebraska Husker apparel, memorabilia and gifts this side of the country.    Its seriously insane...everything from t-shirts and slippers to bobble heads and 8 foot tall blow-up lawn ornaments.    If youre from NE, or just a Huskers fan in general, you MUST stop by this store!!    Hours vary, check website for details...steady hours during football season only.

My trips to the vet in the past have been detrimental for both Toby and I.  My little feline buddy would curse me for days after shoving him in a hard plastic carrier for the 45 minute (perhaps Christy L and I were making the EXACT same trip before) roadie to the vet.  He would scream and pee and freak out and I would do just about the same.  By the time we got back home it felt like we were never be friends again.    Enter Scottsdale Cat Clinic.    Our 6 minute jaunt to the doc was still filled with the regular car-indused mania but  knowing we were just blocks from our destination made things much easier.  When we arrived, our very patient and loving vet-tech Katrina cradled my little freak-out king, talking softly and calmly, and Toby took to her right away.  They cleaned him up (6 minutes is sure as shit still time to wet yourself!) and made him feel comfortable.  They werent at all nervous or annoyed when he started hissing a bit later at a needle, or when he scoffed at their treat bribes to sit still on the scale.    The office was clean and modern and the staff, everyone from the receptionist to the Dr was polite, organized and intelligent.  Usually vet offices are chaotic frenzy but this felt more like I was walking into a pet spa.  I love that this office specializes in cats only as well.    Toby just needed an annual check up, a rabies shot and a new diet for his extra summer weight so we were in and out in no time.  The office even called us the very next day to check in on us and be sure he had handled the whole trip just fine.    To me, a good vet is hard to find, and as important as a good doctor.  I will never take my cat anywhere else!

If you want to watch more than 8 people in any given night make total asses of themselves, indulge in stiff, cheap drinks, compete in a mess of bar athletics, or stand in a corner alone being judgemental, Patty's is the place for you!    I love this bar.  Sure, I'm a tad weirded out by it almost every time I cautiously enter but whatever, adventures in bar hopping never hurt anyone.  And usually, once I hop into Patty's I'm there for the long haul.    Theres a whole slew of randoms here--some "Scottsdale" types, some biker types, frat boy types, your grandfather, a homeless pregnant woman...a melting pot of boozers, all out to have a good time.    Its an outdoor-but-indoor establishment so those of you who are out to destroy your lungs and my evening by puffing on Newports all night, youre free to do so here, without my complaining.  Drinks wont break the bank and you can dance your little heart out to a wide range of tunes.    Leave your snot attitude at the door (or dont, most patrons here are too drunk to care about your Choos getting stained by their spilling red headed slut), Pattys isnt the cleanest or most trendy spot in Old Town. Which makes it one you simply cant pass up.

Wow my fellow yelpers..."AMAZING!!"???    You guys have been in AZ too long.  Sure, IT got the job done when my sweet tooth was screaming for satisfaction the other night, but "amazing" is reserved for the likes of Oregano's Bazookie, Ted Drew's frozen custard or my grandmothers peach pie.    Ice Tango...for me...not amazing.  Good, yes.  And in a good location.  And clean and the staff was nice.  But when I'm looking for dessert, "twangy tart" simply cant stand up to any kind of chocolate, which they had none of, at least in the frozen yogurt genre.    However, fresh, creative toppings and not TOO overly priced, especially for this McDonald and Scottsdale Rd location...I'll go again when I'm looking for something a little more healthy and a little less amazing.

I am very convinced that there is no such thing as a sports bar with good service in Scottsdale.  Dukes is no exception.    I went to Dukes last Sunday for the Chargers game and it was packed.  I was pretty happy to see a sports bar within stumbling distance to my house that was actually a lot bigger than it looks from outside.  Sure, its in a strip mall but I can overlook that.    What I cant overlook is how downright miserable our server looked when she was actually anywhere near our table, which wasnt often.  I almost deducted two stars for this, since other friends of mine had been there the day before and said their service from another girl was equally as poor.    What I do like about Dukes:  Cheap drinks Bloody Mary bar A billion TVs Shuffle Board The layout and big space Free Wi-Fi (No I did not take my laptop, but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately, it seemed like a good thing)  All in all, a good place to watch the game, whoever youre cheering for.  Maybe service at the bar (instead of at a table) is better.

SO happy to see another sushi place in Old Town that isnt anything like RA.  I went on a weeknight and being with my date, I think I could have gone to Arby's and had the time of my life, so perhaps my review is a bit biased...but, I really enjoyed my time at Pure.    The atmosphere and location are perfect for me, living 2 miles away, and the service was timely and friendly.  Creative, fun rolls and VERY fresh fish.  Trendy, yes...  But again, we went on a weeknight and it wasnt busy at all...do the same if youre looking for something a little less high maintenence, I tend to think it gets pretty Scottsdale on the weekends.

My parents are in from out of town and after we trekked our way up and back Pinnacle Peak, we decided to reward ourselves with burgers.  Having taken them to Indulge Burger the last time they were here, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers had something to live up to.    They definitely came through for us.  We had the grilled asparagus appetizer along with the soft pretzel (what?  We just got done hiking and you can eat anything after you work out, FYI)  and both were VERY good.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The pretzel was soft, hot and salted well, but not too much.    I had the Juicy Lucy burger, which was medium rare just like I requested.  Melty cheese in the middle with a side of tots (they even offer tot-chos, the decadant tater tot/nachos which was one thing we actually didnt try), it was amazing.  My mom had a veggie burger which had great flavor, and the sweet tots which are sweet potato tots, which I had never had and were quite good.  My dad's burger was also cooked to his liking, with lots of luscious onion rings on the side.    They have a selection of hot dogs also, and a build your own macaroni and cheese option also.  YUM.  There was also something about homemade chips with buffalo sauce and blue cheese that I'll try after my next mountain.    Staff was friendly and prompt.  Great bottled beer selection including my favorite: Bell's Two Hearted Ale and of course, Sierra Nevada.

Oh how I hope this place stays!!    Ive only been once and it was totally dead.  That being said, it was a holiday, I had just gotten back into town, had a long flight and wanted something healthy and quick to eat.  Read some reviews and since I could walk to Detours if it wasnt a gazillion degrees out, I cracked up the AC and drove over for some take out.  Here's the scoop: It was ready when they said it would be, and my meal was AWESOME.  I got the green chile bison burger with pepperjack because I had no idea what else to get, their website was (and still is, two weeks post-meal) under construction and you cant see a damn thing they have to offer.    This is HUGE.    ***When people go to your website and cant see what food you offer, they arent going to come!!***  Lucky for you I was starving and came anyway.   I also got the kale and quinoa salad which, yes, is as good as everyone says it is, and also, yes, is a little weird because the kale is completely raw and needed some dressing or cooking or something.    The burger was cooked to perfection, the wheat bun wasnt too dry, and the veggies accompanying it were fresh and crispy (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles..).    Prices are good, I paid $13 for both the burger and HUGE quinoa salad.  One turn off I cant ignore:  When I walked in there was only one table of people in the restaurant, and they had been talking to the hostess, bartender, another server, etc.  I get it, youre not busy, everyone is chatting and congregating, fine.  But when I walked in, the hostess mouthed "shhh' to the others and everyone giggled.  OK, this is not okay.  Its rude.  And I dont think there was anything malicious meant by it or anything, but it was enough for me to notice and feel slightly awkward coming in and having everyone look at me like I wasnt in on the joke.  The bartender was super friendly and rang me up and I was on my way.  The biggest deal ever?  No.  But it made my first impression of the place worthy of 4 stars instead of 5.    All in all, I really appreciate the healthy attitude toward food that Detours has going on.  Its delicious food and a nice, clean atmosphere.  I hope others find it soon and make it a fun place to go also!

Oh because you're a professional BBQ eater. Like you are so excited to finally have a platform to speak your mind on BBQ. Shhhh...  I loved this place. And while I haven't summered in Santa Maria, I certainly know good BBQ and even more so, good service when it's standing across the bar from me. Steve was super (and not just his beard) - attentive, conversational, and on top of our orders. My fiancé and I didn't wait long for our salmon (mine, because I'm sweating for the wedding) and tri tip plate (his, because he's smoking hot already) with sides of pork belly mac and cheese and fries because PORK BELLY MAC AND CHEESE - all cooked to perfection and super flavorful. Not at all overdone (tri tip was actually quite rare - yum) and moist *shudder*   The owner, Dave (shout out to Brat Haus next door) even came by to check in on us, which I appreciate. Cool vibe, non-pretentious clientele (minus the Santa Maria snobs) and great food. Yay for another chill Old Town joint. We will be back!
