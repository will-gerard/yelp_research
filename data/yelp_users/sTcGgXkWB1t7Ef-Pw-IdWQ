Tempe Mission Palms Hotel is a great place to stay when you are attending a conference and when you are coming from out of state. I stayed for a night, October 14, 2014 at $183.95 + $14.95 hospitality fee. Walking distance to a lot of restaurants & shops. It has a nice courtyard. Only 10 minutes from PHX airport, the hotel provides a free shuttle service. The friendly staff helped me checked in to my room at 11:30 AM earlier than their 3:00 PM scheduled policy. The room was very cozy. The only thing that bothers me was the windows do not effectively reduce the outside noise which sometimes can be too loud.

The ribeye I ordered was tender, juicy, and tasty. I prefer it cooked at medium. But the one I got was a little bit over cooked. The restaurant ambiance was cozy. Our server was attentive and accessible.

Ordered double Jack & Coke. Got Jack, Coke, and lots of ICE!! Filled the glass 70% with ice, a good jaw breaker. Price $13.00 + tip.
