Came here with a few friends. Food is decent, except one of my friends got a soup that didn't taste right (might have given her the wrong order?). Although I'd like to give this place another shot, the service will definitely be keeping me away. It wasn't busy at all, but our server was not very attentive. Maybe if I'm desperate for Thai when I'm downtown, I'll give it another shot.

I'll say it off the bat, I work here so I may be a bit biased.  BUT, I know that they only serve their freshest cuts of fish and don't even bother serving anything below par to customers! Their rolls are obviously not genuinely Japanese, but they have specials everyday of their newest incoming fish for those that want "real Japanese food".  The chefs are very flexible and friendly and are able to make any suggestions necessary as long as you ask politely.  Happy hour Sunday-Thursday and beer specials with discounted apps every day!  Very affordable and tasty, they have something for everyone.  Still have yet to try their teppanyaki, but I've never heard any complaints.  The baked scallop roll and Fiji Tiger roll are a must have!  PS- be nice to servers, we make less than minimum wage and more than half of the income comes from tips.  We try the best we can!

After hearing so much about BJ's, my brother and I went last night along with our pastor friend who lives just down the street.  We got the fried artichoke as an app, which was very good.  I had a baked potato with chicken and broccoli which was smothered in cheese and my brother had a chili cheese burger (those skinny fries are sooo good!).  Our friend had one of their BJ's deep dish pizza and I had a slice.  Not too greasy and with just the right about of crunch from the dough.  Then we topped it off with the red velvet pazooki, which was amazing!  But it's hard to go wrong with a pazooki.   The guys tried out a couple beers which they all thought were decent, but non of us are any sort of beer experts.    Overall the food was great and atmosphere was comfortable, but just a little loud.  Not the kinda place you want to go for peace and quiet, but not overbearing either.  Our server came to check up on us frequently and she was very polite.    Will come again!

Wowie, is this place difficult to find!  But it's well worth the journey of getting lost on my way there!  My friend and I went for lunch and we thought we had stepped into an alternate universe or the set of Desperate Housewives.  I had the tomato-basil sandwich and my friend the veggie and they were quite tasty (although we both agreed that the 9-grain bread really made them great).  The reason we stopped by the place was cause I heard that they had won an episode of Cupcake Wars and had to try them out for myself.  I got the coconut and lemon for my brother who loved it and he's not much of a dessert kinda guy.  My friend got the double chocolate-something-or-other and said it was good but too sweet for her liking.  Their frosting to cake ratio was spot on, I thought!  Their coffee was also very good, we both had iced lattes but will want to come back and try their "monsoons".  The prices are a tiny bit higher than my liking, but worth an occasional visit.  Overall fabulous place and will return with friends!

I was so excited to try this place out, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be back.  Not the greatest place for sushi sad to say. Good things first, the restaurant is very clean and has an environment that easy to just sit down and chat for a meal, nothing fancy.   My friends and I had a few rolls and the yakisoba noodles.  The rice on the spicy tuna and albacore rolls were old like it had been left out in the open for too long.  The fish in the rolls weren't too bad, but it was a bit chewy.  We also got the Eel Special and Crunch roll, which both had a decent flavor, but nothing really stood out or had anything that was creative about them at all.  The yakisoba noodles were okay in flavor, but there was a pool of sauce on the bottom of the bowl, which shouldn't be an issue with any kind of stir-fry.   I work at a sushi place so I'm always out on the look out for great sushi joints.  This isn't one of them.   Save your time and money and try Sakana instead!

Came here yesterday and got the Strawberry Cheesecake and the Raspberry Lemon.  The strawberry cheesecake was soo good!  Frosting not too sweet and the cake was moist, just the right frosting to cake ratio.  Only tried the frosting from the raspberry, but that was pretty tasty as well!    My heart will always belong to Sugar Daddy's (which is now Sweet Daddy) in my home town of Glendale, but since this place is right next to my current location, I'll be coming back.

I go here whenever I get the chance, a personal favorite as far as Phoenix coffee goes.  Their espresso is so smooth with a really clean aftertaste and doesn't leave that slight bitterness lingering in the back of your head towards the end of the drink (but maybe that's just me).   I always get the honey vanilla latte, you can't go wrong! Plus, the place has a great atmosphere, clean and bright with a small boutique next door.  I'm actually a barista in Chandler, and a little ashamed to give Giant such a good review, but it's really that good!  Go now!

So I come here any chance I get and figure it's about time I give back some love.  This place is amazing.  I usually come for the tsoynamis, which are never disappointing. Better than real, dairy-based ice cream!! They have great treats and baked goods, smooth espresso, and friendly staff. Never have I had a bad experience here.    You won't regret it! Promise!

Came here with the bestie and her tot and were pleasantly surprised.  We shared edamame and a few rolls- tootsie, salmon, and what I think was called the sunrise roll (Cali roll with salmon and thinly sliced lemon on top), which was super tasty.  Fish was fresh and rice was cooked perfectly with good seasoning.  The servers were also very attentive (maybe a bit too attentive since it was slow, but I guess that's not a bad thing).  We came during lunch and they had a special on certain rolls, 2 for $7.  Good deal! We didn't go too crazy on the raw stuff because my friend is still exploring, but what we had was great.  Even her daughter liked the salmon roll!  Prices are decent and they have a great selection of creative rolls and other Japanese foods for those non-raw fish eaters.

SSSOOOOO excited to check this place out when I heard they sell Intelligentsia Coffee. I've only been twice (two days in a row...heh) and was more then happy with both visits. The espresso sells itself, they use Trader Joe's almond milk, free wifi, and the baristas are super friendly and accommodating. The space is quaint, a couple tables and couches, and you can't tell that it's a place that buys gold at all. I even saw a Settlers of Catan game board!   The only downfall is that they have no sign, which makes it extremely difficult to find; there's only a "We Sell Gold" sign out front. However, we were told by the barista that they are in the process of changing signs.  This is a must for all coffee-lovers in AZ!

Awesome people! Really feels like a Jesus-centered church.  Sermons are always scripture-based and community groups are great for applying the message to everyday life as well as finding other brothers and sisters to walk in faith/keep you accountable/pray for one another.  Main services are held in the auditorium of ASU Prep and the Kids' ministry is right across the auditorium, on the west side of the school.   Really an awesome church worth checking out!
