I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save 20 bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires (my spare is a full size as well) three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs.

The food is amazing!  The service tends to be hit or miss, but let's be honest...most people don't go to Pita Jungle for the service.  We always get hummus with grilled chicken (which is amazing!), but last time I ordered the fruit platter for my five year old.  It was huge.  Between three adults and one five year old, we put a small dent on the fruits and cheeses, but it was delicious. Everything is fresh and yummy.

Quick Trip is the only gas station that is a sure place to stop for a clean bathroom.  The attendants are friendly and very quick too.  Their gas prices are generally lower than Circle K and they have every drink on the planet inside.

My son takes golf lessons here.  So far he's having a great time.  The instructors are very kind and patient.

I love this nail spa.  It's my favorite place for a pedicure. It's a little expensive, but the designs always last awhile and your feet and legs feel great afterwards.

This is my favorite Target. Period.   It is clean, well lit, has everything you could possibly need to buy on your grocery list, and pretty well organized.   The sales people are super friendly, and the deli guy is awesome.  He is super nice and always talks to my kid too, which I like.   The only negative?  I spend way too much money here.
