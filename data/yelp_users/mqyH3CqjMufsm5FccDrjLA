I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was perfect.  Phoenix Little Theatre is basically attached to the Phoenix Art Museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show. Take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.     Free and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting.

I had pretty high expectations for honey bears and they definitely followed through! YUMMY! We got the chicken and ribs combo and you really don't need teeth to eat it!..... totally melt off the bone, tender, yummy goodness.    Usually my friend and I talk each others ears off when we are out and tend to ignore food/drinks... I am pretty sure we were completely silent devouring our food until we were licking our fingers clean!   They do have specials each day of the week. Tuesday was 2-4-1 beers :)  This is a no frills kind of place. Just order, wait for it at the counter, grab a seat and enjoy.  Its kind of great though... you know exactly what you're getting... no need for 'atmosphere' or attentive customer service because the food speaks for itself.    My only gripe was that they don't have cornbread, which is disappointing at a BBQ place. Instead dinner comes with disappointing white bread rolls.  I wouldn't call the location particularly sketchy.  There is a big parking lot and its right on Central Ave near lots of nicer places too.

The further into the sketchier parts of Phoenix we drove, the more I knew that Mariscos Playa Hermosa was going to be legit. Its quite unassuming from the outside but the overly-enthused lobster sign out front let's you know you've arrived.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa may appear a bit ghetto but open its doors and you've entered a tropical island paradise.  The inside reminds me of what the Chiquita Banana lady's house would look like...  blindingly bright colors, suns, moons, parrots, wooden fruit, flowers and trees.     There was one man running the show and he was superb.  Very attentive, expedient and friendly.   You won't be disappointed with the shrimp culichi or any of the cerviche menu options... not to mention the wide margarita selection.

This place is called East Side now ... but still shows up on my blackberry as The Breakroom.  They even still have signs inside the bar referring to it as The Breakroom.   Its really not as scary as it looks from the outside.  But I will admit it does look at bit scary from the outside.  The 'no tweeker' sign is awesome :) Its a big place with lots of pool tables and apparently good karaoke, although I was not there for that.  The bartenders were really nice and you could tell everyone in there was having a good time.  We drank rootbeer barrels (although the bartender didn't know what they were she was really nice at trying to make one for us)   $1 PBR on Sundays! And other really great specials throughout the week. *** and they even have hooks under the bar for your purse*** totally won me over with that... such a necessity but such a hard thing to find in dives.

This just might be my favorite bar and I wish it was closer to my house. I can only speak to the downstairs bar but it was fantastic.    Just the walk to get down to the basement bar sets the tone for a great night. As you walk down the long cave-like staircase surrounded floor to ceiling in rock... you feel like you might be walking into a creepy cellar but at the bottom it opens up into a cozy classy bar ... equipped with fireplaces, comfy sofas and soft lighting.    The bartenders were great. Really knowledgeable and great service. My date and I stayed well past all other patrons but the bartender didn't seem to mind at all and continued suggesting wines for us! Rokerij opened my eyes to Zaca Mesa wines... highly recommended!   Can't wait to go back and try the food. I've heard nothing but the best and will soon be able to attest :)

LOVE IT! What more can a girl ask for besides drinking cheap Stella's and watching middle aged men slam into the plexi glass wall of the bar.  Yes, this bar is actually attached to the hockey rink!    Instead of paying for the pros just come to Ice House and drink better beer at lower prices and watch more entertaining games (less skilled = more fights)!  The occasional whack of the puck hitting the glass tends to startle even the guy with the biggest bar tab into a moment of sobriety.  Or if you're me you just spill a bit of beer down your shirt and hope you aren't sipping it the next time a puck bangs into the glass :)   The crowd at Ice Tavern is hilarious and rowdy (in a good way, not in a frat boy way).  The bartender was awesome... so awesome that when I left my ID there (dive bar pub crawl = less careful with nuances like ID's and wallets) I got a free drink when I came to fetch it because I have the DONOR sticker on my license.  How great.

This was my second time coming to Le Le's and I'll certainly be back for more. My nail technician, Tina, was wonderful too. Maybe it was because the place wasn't too busy but she took a lot of time on my nails, really making sure each one was finished to perfection.  It is usually pretty quiet inside, which I happen to love.  I prefer sitting and reading a magazine/relaxing rather than the common nail salon gossip/chatting.    I got a pedicure and acrylics with gel for only $48. Legit quality with a low price tag.

T Cooks is my favorite Happy Hour in the area. For reals. I want to go there right now. My boyfriend and I somewhat arrived on accident one night, only to realize that I have been missing the best happy hour ever! We have been back many times since, and I try to recommend it to all my girlfriends.   Its part of the Palm Hotel, so obviously its beautiful, elegant, comfortable and more.  They have a lovely inside bar and live music sometimes too.  But my favorite spot to sit is the beautiful outside patio, especially now, as the weather here is amazing.   So they have super fancy smancy cocktail list, which is all 50% off  during happy hour.  They also have awesome discounted appetizers. We had the pretzel bites with cheese and grilled brie.  But the best night to go is Monday night for Mustache Monday.  They have even more discounted cocktails with names like "The Ron Burgundy and Fu-Manchu".  Also - fake mustaches. So fun!  Connie is awesome, she is super cute and has been our server a few times now. Always spot on with recommendations and even comped us a few drinks when the service was slow. Little did she know that I love T Cooks despite anything!

Staple of phoenix.  LGO offers so much besides a cup of coffee and breakfast sandwich (both of which are phenomenal).  Its a bit of sensory overload when you walk into LGO... its ALWAYS crowded (people can really sniff out a good thing), and its crammed full of their specialty market and grocery items (tough on my pursestrings because everything they sell is either ridiculously cute or scrumptious). The entire atmosphere is incredibly adorable.   It'd be sacreligious not to get a Havana Latte... Now that I'm thinking about one I just might have to make a quick LGO run today.  The breakfast sandwiches are also to die for and don't forget a red velvet Tammie Coe cupcake (breakfast of champions).    There is the LGO Pizzeria next door/attached and it is also super delicious.    Only negatives are that LGO is very popular and therefore has limited seating.  So if you are wanting to stay awhile to either work or gossip you might have a hard time finding a seat.  Parking can be a nightmare too.  The last few time I've gotten lucky but its somewhat hit or miss and awkward to park.

One of my favorite places.  I really love trying new places, in fact I routinely avoid places I've been before in lieu of trying somewhere new.  Postino is one of my exceptions. I will come here anytime and be toally content.   Consistantly high quality, great service and even better atmosphere.  I am obviously not alone in this thinking because Postino can have a hefty wait time, especially for the bruchetta and wine special on Monday nights.  Its WORTH THE WAIT though.  The goat cheese and tomato jam bruchetta is the BEST!  I always try to get a double order of that one instead of picking four different kinds.  I do believe 'sharing is caring' but I have my limits and not when it comes to Postino brushettas.    The wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter.  I have sat at the bar and sampled various wines before choosing and the bartenders have all been very knowledgeable and friendly.    Postino is a perfect place for a date, girls night out, or family dinner.  It is hard to find a singular place that is so appropriate for any occasion.   Parking really isn't a terrible problem. There is a 'free' valet to help you out, which I truly appreciate instead of having to fend for myself in that crowded cramped lot.

My first time at Joe's was for the Festival of Flesh and it did not disappoint! Tucked back in an unassuming strip mall, Joe's Grotto is really a great find. Inside is dark, intimate and cave-like... making 'Grotto' an appropriate name choice.   The stage area had plenty of room around it for standing or sitting at tables.  The bar was large enough so you didn't have to wedge yourself between leather cladded bodies just to grab a whiskey sour.  The bartenders were great and remembered what I had been ordering so all I had to do was hold up one or two fingers depending on how many I wanted. Even gave me extra cherries :) huge bonus points. There is also a large outdoor area with a whole other bar attached.    The event I went to see was absolutely out of this world fantastic but that is a whole other story.  Joe's Grotto as a venue or a bar was great and I will definitely be checking out their calendar of events! You should too!

Delicioso!  I LOVE mexican breakfast food.  Carolinas is not only for breakfast (their tamales are to die for too) but breakfast is what I can most accurately RAVE about at Carolinas.  Get the MACHACA!  Delicous beef 'ish' meat wrapped in homemade tortillas... still warm and stretchy!   I finally physically went to Carolina's today and its great and to the point.  Order at the counter and its ready for you in a split second.  They have AWESOME SALSA in the 'eating area' to smother your machaca etc. with.   So yummy.    Its quite busy inside which is a fair representation of how scrumptious Carolina's is!  A true mexican food gem downtown.... which is nice to actually find because there are SO many choices... but CHOOSE CAROLINAS! :)

I JUST heard about this place and am sad I've lived in Tempe for four years without checking out Hollywood Alley.  Its fantastic!  There is live music almost every night... cool stage... really dark in there....big black 50's style leather round booths/tables, posters and random art all over the walls.  Perfect! I really prefer dives that 'try' to have an atmosphere... make themselves an 'eclectic hole-in-the-wall' not just a hole in the wall.  Hollywood Alley totally lives up to my expectations.  The back room is packed with vintage arcade games galore, a book exchange (YES, a free book exchange!!! How great is that?) ... mostly trashy romance novels but a few gems in there....    Drinks were cheap and big... they put well drinks in HUGE glasses... definitely twice the size of the usual lowball glasses at most bars.  Really fantastic beer selection too! Haven't tried the food but I will.... definitely going back to Hollywood Alley!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed the BEST coffee shop in the East Valley or perhaps even in the entire Phoenix area.  When I had no life (opressed by school, thesis and MCAT) I would spend most of my waking hours at Gold Bar.  I should have been paying them rent.   Its more than just a coffee shop... it just has this irreplicable ATMOSPHERE and the friendliest employees I've ever encountered.  Its family owned and everyone that works there is somehow related to one another... creates this really personal vibe and you know they take great pride in their product.    Allan Bros. coffee is the best.  I have even had a friend in Oregon bring some down here for me.  I refuse to drink Starbucks garbage after my palatte has become accustomed to Allan Bros. Its almost annoying because now I frankly dislike any other coffee besides Allan Bros.  Delectable.   If you are too fancy for plain coffee or want to color outside the lines...try the Granida... so YUMMY! Its frap'esque' but infinitely better.  Also their iced Toddy is great if you want a jolt of caffiene without the bitterness of regular iced coffee.    Every Sunday morning there is LIVE MUSIC (guitar) at Gold Bar... so lovely and worth checking out.    ***remember your punch card... after 10 punches you get a $1.00 drink! :)

So the happy hour is really cheap... I can't deny that.  $2 drafts and $2.50 wells.  However that bar itself doesn't have much else to offer.    I am a really big dive bar fan and appreciate a relaxed and informal environment.  However, beyond being informal I like my dives to have some character... something distinguishing.  Unfortunately Horse and Hound totally lacks in this arena.  Its much more ghetto for its location than I was anticipating.  I was disappointed in the place...its all very obvious. Sports games on, pool tables, harsh lighting, nothing fun on the walls, very standard decorum....    Its just a place that you can have a drink in... nothing that special about it.  If I am going to pay for a drink then I am also paying for the environment I am in.... otherwise I will drink at home by the pool etc. Horse and Hound just did not cut it for me.

Huge fan of this place.  Unexpectedly so... I live right off Broadway and have blindly driven right past Pranksters without quite noticing it... or at least giving it much thought.  Ladies and gentleman, I was wrong.  Pranksters deserves our attention and our hepatic cells.    Every day of the week there is a different 'special' (cheap food and drink items). I prefer Sundays for their phenomenal bloody marys.  I haven't had one that great without using the Zing Zang mix (which I highly recommend).  Bartenders are great and bathrooms are decent too!  The place is really large but its unfortunate that the bar area is so small and crowded.  There are only 8ish chairs at the bar and the pool table is RIGHT there. So if you decide to play make sure you look where you are jabbing that cue.  Also be careful if you are walking nearby... you may get jabbed, mess up someone's shot, get a dirty look while giving a dirtier look.

Just as I expected it to be.  A total hole in the wall.  Something that I've driven by dozens of times without ever noticing.  Yes, it does look a bit intimidating from the outside...but that flicker of doubt is what entices you to open the door and then to stay.... for probably way too many drinks. Totally unassuming yet completely unappreciated.    Typical dive... absolutely no frills.  BUT LADIES, they have hooks for your purse under the bar!!! ... I was shocked... its one of the gnarliest dives I've been to in awhile... yet they have the convenient purse hooks!   Drinks are cheap - $2 Mickeys- the night I was there... beer inside what looks to be a grenade... and for only two dollars... I'm in.    The best and most hilarious part is that is doubles as a small convenience store.  There is popcorn, top ramen, mints, nuts, jerky, and more...   *They do have two pool tables crammed inside*

FANTASTIC!    FYI This review only concerns the Puppet Slam for adults  Skip spending more money for a Harkins ticket and come see the hilariously entertaining and offbeat puppet show! $8 dollars if you reserve them in advance!   Acts are all great... some raunchy and dirty... some a bit more indie with a social commentary vibe.  Overall, all really intricate and you can see the work and dedication put into the puppets and staging.  Beautiful.    Best part of all.... the puppet theatre is inside an old MORMON CHURCH... so please drink a beer (or five) and watch frisky puppets telling vulgar jokes.  That being said, the facility is gorgeous... lovely exterior and huge wooden castle-like doors opening into the theatre room.   I love that a place like this exists and is a great way to spend a spontaneous Friday night!

Bikini is everything I could ever ask for in a bar. Its a dive. Its has awesomely random and strange decorum.  Marginally sanitary bathrooms. Cheap whiskey sours. Sassy bartenders. Interesting clientele. Located in a janky neighborhood.  *but no hooks for purses under the bar* (still five star worthy though)    I was already pumped driving by Bikini... I could just tell it was perfect.  As I was arriving a guy was literally thrown out of a neighboring liquor store and stumbled into Bikini.  Interior not disappointing in the least. Behind the bar is full of decorative oddities for your viewing pleasures.  The bartender definitely didn't take shit from anyone *including some strange characters that chatted us up at the bar*.  Beers on tap were $2.75 I believe ... Fat Tire nonetheless!   Starting filling up around 10pm with an awesome crowd.  I found myself in a conversation with some 'interesting folk' at the bar next to me about multiple universes and aliens... I didn't have too much to add to that one but you just never know who you'll meet there .... ideal.    A great dive with a diverse bunch of people and the possibility for some great stories if you stick around long enough or stop in often enough :)  *** CA$H bar only***

Parking can be a pain but so worth it.  SO FUN!  I've been to Char's on random nights of the week and no matter what it is still busy and the live music is awesome.  Rarely can you count on a place to have quality live music, a bustling dance floor and speedy drink service every night of the week.  Char's is that place.  LOVE IT!!!  Interior is a bit tacky in the best way possible.  I swear the ceiling looks like its covered in red velvet (too bad it just appears that way).    The crowd at Char's is one of my favorite things about it. No one would feel out of place and everyone is legitimately  having a really great time. It really is more of mix of motown and soul than the blues, which is better to me! You know you're having a good night when find yourself dancing to Earth Wind and Fire.  Both bands I've seen play were equally talented and engaging.  Not to mention one of the drummers was a stud and a bit of eye candy does make the whole deal sweeter ;)   I will definitely be making Char's a 'go to' place from here on out!

This place is awesome.  Looks like a true hole-in-the-wall from the outside. Very unassuming.  But inside is actually quite nice with colorful chandeliers and a nice bar area - bathrooms were nice too-    The food is phenomenal.  And cheap!!!  Go on Tuesdays - special is the carne adovada.  And the carne adovada is to die for.  Two people can easily split one order and be totally full.  You can cut the meat with a spoon.  Mmmmm so yummy just thinking about it.  I want to try other food choices but I just know I won't be able to tear myself away from re-ordering the adovada.    Everyday of the week a different menu choice is on special so make a week out of Blue Adobe :)

Each time I pass the inebriated frog sign that welcomes you to Groggy's, I knew I had to try it out. I should say that the rad frog sign out front created higher expectations for me than was ultimately fair for Groggy's. I was expecting something a bit more 'unique' but Groggy's is fundamentally like many beer/pool/wings kind of bars.     Its a pretty big place though with an area outside to eat/smoke... overlooking the ambiance of ghetto apache/main street (Its probably Main St by that point).  They had a really great special on Sundays ($7 for 12 wings and 32oz of beer).  The wings were not particularly great though.... quite soggy (no Groggy rhyme intended).    Although the Groggy logo has a place in my heart, I doubt I'll be frequenting Groggy's.

I know the season is almost over but get to a game! I am no sports nut but I do know that if I have a badass time at a sporting event, then it must be pretty damn fun!   As with all Spring training events... the experience is so much more intimate than season games... no matter where you are sitting, the field and players are quite close... you actually have a chance of getting knocked out by a foul ball... and everyone is in a freakishly good mood.    Bar none the location of Giants field is ideal.  Right in the heart of old town.  Easy to walk/stumble to dozens of bars after the game... possibly even spot Giants players along the way or at the bars! All the fans are just great and here on vacation... all smiles and cheer.    Its simply a fun way to spend an afternoon watching professional athletes without the expensive ticket costs or being stuck out in Maryvale or Surprise.

Great sports bar in Old Town.  This place really is a gem among the typical trendy old town bars and restaurants.  Its right by Scottsdale Stadium and in one of my favorite sections of Old Town ... (the park area with all the grass, fountains and the LOVE sign)   All the bartenders were super friendly and drink prices were very reasonable.  I went there with my Dad (not the most easily impressed man) and my younger brother.. all of us have very different tastes and standards BUT we ALL LOVED Blue Moose.    Its really clean for a dive'ish' sports bar and right next to Orange Table (one of my favorite breakfast places)... So next game day go have brunch at Orange Table... read in the park... kiss your boyfriend under the LOVE sign, go drink too many beers at BLUE MOOSE!!!... and finally sleep it off back at the park :)  Your car will be safely and conveniently waiting for you in the huge and never-crowded FREE parking garage next door!

I really like this place.    1. Its really big and the outside seating is badass... a little canal with a bridge you need to walk across, outdoor bar, quite isolated from busy Hayden Road... feels like you are on a neighbors back porch.   2. The menus look like newspapers.  Enough said.   3.  The food is pretty good.  Spicy enough.  Had the Enchantment Platter and it was awesome! Totally recommend it ... get to sample some of the best stuff on the menu all in one entree.  Margaritas are pretty good there too.   4. Service is good.  Everyone I've ever encountered is really friendly and efficient.    5.  The place as a physical structure is rad.  It feel like you are entering an Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. A rough and tumble stone facade archway leads you up a ramp to the entrance.  Fake bats dangle from it.  A little waterfall, bridge... but no snake pit :)

I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Coach House yet.  This is truly my favorite bar and always my 'go-to' spot.  Great location in old town but without the typical Scottsdale crowd.  Lots of parking.  Great bartenders.  Cheap and strong drinks (best combination).  Moderately sanitary bathrooms.  Crazy christmas lights and decorations.    If you are lucky enough to go around the holiday season... it is literally like Santa threw up all over Coach House.  Lights, wrapping paper, ornaments, candy canes, shitty Christmas decorations up the ying yang.  Its wonderful.  I would not want to be the guy having to put up/take down all that each year.    Every single time I go to Coach House, it is an awesome time.  Always meet interesting people and have actually made a few friends from my encounters there.    The inside is fairly small with rickety tables but a great jukebox and arcade games.  Large outdoor area to meander as well.   *BEST BAR IN OLD TOWN*

You could easily get lost in here and be happy that you are. Don't be surprised if you walk into Antique Trove when its light outside but need to turn on your car's headlights for the drive home. There is no such thing as a quick visit to Antique Trove.  If I am ever in a cranky mood, this is where I come.  You are guaranteed to find so much awesome stuff. Yes, some will be incredibly random but isn't that the point sometimes. In all seriousness too... there are really great pieces of furniture and art, which are VERY reasonably priced.    !!!There is no longer any excuse to go to Target or Pier One for art when Antique Trove is right up the street!!!  Do yourself a favor and go to Antique Trove!  It will always be one of my favorite places in the valley.

Dr. Greenberg and staff are absolutely the best. He is super friendly and approachable. I have been going to Dr. Greenberg for probably 8+ years now, and have recommended him to lots of co workers and friends.    He loves his job and it shows through to his office, staff, patients etc.  I so appreciate when doctors really educate their patients and tell you what they are doing and why.  Dr. Greenberg takes the cake here! He is so enthusiastic about the purpose of each test and what the resulting images show.  I am a bit of a science nerd, so I really love that he doesn't mind taking the time to explain things.    When I got my contacts last year, he even made sure they placed the order a certain way so that I would get the highest rebate back. Best eye doc ever! Enough said!

I have a hard time loving Tempe bars (esp since Mill Ave dominates that scene) However Stray Cat was a good time!   Tuesday night is the night to go! $5 for unlimited wells and drafts from 8:30 to 9:30.  Its not terribly crowded either (somehow people don't know how great this is) so you can easily get refills etc before time runs out.  But don't be too sad because once 9 30 rolls around they have great drink specials.  $3 long islands etc etc.    They serve food all night too.  The Ghost Pepper wings were AWESOME. I love spicy hot food and the bartender kept warning us about these wings- even gave us plastic gloves to eat them with- warned us about going to the bathroom afterwards without a thorough hand washing.  They were sooo good! Yes, they were hot but they still had flavor, which is really hard to find in 'super hot foods'.  Granted I had my fair share of alcohol coursing though my veins.  So take what you may from the Ghost Pepper Wings review.    Its a big place with lots of different areas including a DJ/dance area. The DJ's are awesome - especially Julio-  Totally a hipster vibe there - along the lines of Timeout Lounge and Yucca.  Everyone there is super friendly in the best way... not like 'I am a predator that just wants to take you home with me so I will pretend to care what your name is' or 'I am a creepy man that will roofie your cosmo when you look away' ... but rad people that can hold conversations. Always bodes well for a bar when they tend to draw a cool crowd of people.     GREAT FOOD, DRINKS, MUSIC, PEOPLE and FUN!!! Go to Stray Cat!!!!

Its haunted! Isn't that enough to get everyone to go check out Casey Moore's?  Who doesn't like Casper?!  Such a great compromise... you are still right around Mill Ave and if you are an ASU student this is quite convenient.  However, Casey's is not part of the typical 'Mill Ave' meat-market scene.  Always is a whole slew of people from old timers, to angstful hipster, to stoic gothic, to average joe.    Drinks are reasonably price with a great late night happy hour.  Food is fantastic... the oysters really live up to the name 'Casey Moore's Oyster House'... besides they are supposed to be an aphrodisiac so bring your dates ;)    Lots of outdoor seating (picnic benches) so you can cram people at tables.  The interior is as divey as you are going to get in Tempe ... so I'll take it.   Only downside is unreliable service.. its been quite hit or miss as far as the bartenders go... but the bouncers/ID checkers are undoubtedly hilarious everytime!

Rad.  This place is simply great.  I have been there both for just the bar scene and separately for just the dining experience (It was post 21st birthday and I wan't about to get a martini, although they are superb).  Out to dinner with the family was great. Everyone loved their entrees and we all tried something different.  Getting 4 out of 4 customers at a table pleased is a feat (especially with my family).  Hands down the BURGER AU POIVRE II (with bacon and bleu cheese) is to die for. Don't even need to look at the rest of the menu.  Waffle fries and the assortment of dipping sauces is also a necessary side.    My 'drinking' experience at AZ88 is even better than my already fantastic dining experience.  Order a Manhattan and order it from Kyle.  He made is perfectly and kept filling up my glass with its remants in the shaker as I sipped it.  How great is that?!?! I also asked for an extra cherry (as always) and he gave me a WHOLE CUP OF CHERRIES.  Again, How great is that?!?! And it gets even greater.... so we all took a fancy to Kyle and asked him to create us a cocktail.  Shockingly (I know) it was great and as he listed off its constituents I was estatic to learn that he had included  ST. GERMAIN in his creation.  Ladies and gentleman, St. Germain is my FAVORIE liqueur and is used in but few cocktails.    *Sidenote - AZ88 is a supposed gay bar at night ... however on this particular Saturday it didn't seem at all like BS West and was fairly quiet... great place to actually have a conversation.  This specific Saturday might be the exception to its usual crowd and volume... I'll go back to confirm or disprove this another weekend.  :)

Its okay.  Simply 'okay' because there is not much to rave about ...and at the same time... there is not much to legitimately complain about either.    The location is great and they do have really nice outdoor seating.  The menu is obvious and trite.  The drinks follow suite and are a bit overpriced but not too terrible for Old Town economics.  I am a sucker for 'themed' places or locales with something that tickles my fancy... something that stands out.  Bungalow is nice, clean and somewhat indefinable.  It just is lacking that certain 'something'.    Overall there are dozens of better options in the Old Town area and you won't be missing out if you happen to bypass Bungalow.

I will never order from chain pizza places again! Mama Mia's is so delicious and never disappoints. Not to mentions very reasonably priced.  They have slices for just a few dollars and such yummy meatballs and cheesy bread.  We always get the pizza slices with basil (simply and tasty) and the side of meatballs.   We probably go to Mama  Mia's far too often for our waistlines, but we live right down the street, how can we resist? Honestly though, even if it wasn't so close to our place I would go out of my way for their pizza.

One of the best restaurants I've had the luxury of dining at in decades. I couldn't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic.  The signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you dainfully sip your way into alcoholic bliss.   The oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' situation.    The cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure. They soothe the restless 'fat kid' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving Cheslea's Kitchen a bit more bareable.

Shady's is not so shady.    Yes its a dive complete with wood paneling, pool tables, juke box, pretty dark atmosphere with most of the lighting coming from neon beer signs etc.    However,  something about it is just a bit nicer than most typical 'dives'.  The crowd was fairly young and the place itself was in good shape.  Didn't have the 'used and abused' look intrinsic to many dive bars. Didn't feel the need to douse myself in hand sanitizer upon leaving the restroom.  Wasn't being checked out by guys with cowboy hats and an AARP card. Bartenders were under 40 and fairly good looking.  I just don't know if I can stomach calling Shady's a truly shady dive.  Its kind of a great combination though.... dive'esque' with some upgrades in a nice area :)  Drinks were reasonably priced Chimay and Stella together were under $10, I believe.  The music was quite dreadful the night I happened to be there.  Very '80's, 90's and today' which is just not want I want to hear in a place like that.  Too kitchy for an indie hipster vibe.

I REALLY like Ticoz.  I went there with a Groupon (wanted to check it out but the 1/2 off Groupon sealed the deal).  First of all before you go, read the menu w/ all the specials.  Its a bit complex but everyday there is not only a rad happy hour but also a drink item that is super cheap ALL day long.... same goes for food too!  Lots of times when food/drinks are quite inexpensive ... you know they are cheap... quality/service etc. is poor.... NOT the case at Ticoz... its a $3 sangria disguised at a $10 sangria  :)  The sangria was beautiful and delicious.  We tried both the passion fruit and the white kiwi (passion fruit was the best!).  Also got a mango mojito... also pretty and tasty. The lettuce wraps were only slightly disappointing.... once again very pretty but they had dried fruit, nuts etc so it tasted more like chicken salad in a lettuce cup.... not your typical 'mexican/asian' flavored meat. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.    The place itself is a great mix of swanky, lounge and classy.  There are chaise-like lounge chairs around the bar area and the outside seating is really lovely.... enclosed in a wrought iron fence complete with lots of foliage.     Totally going back there with or without a Groupon! I am sold!

I actually like this original Vig better than its uptown counterpart.  The outdoor area is definitely my favorite part and its much bigger than the Vig Uptown.  Although its a popular spot I have always had luck finding a seat outside and under a heater lamp! There is always the Bocce ball track too if your conversation runs dry :)   Sweet potato fries are amazing as is everything I've had to eat there! Try to make it on a Monday for the burger and fries $5 deal!  There really is no point paying 7 bucks for Chipolte!   I really vibed with the DJ last time I was at The Vig.  It was like every song he plucked off my Top 25 Playlist and dedicated to me. (In the least narcisisstic way possible).    Only downfall is the parking. They do their best in the awkward corner lot but you are pretty much forced to valet. Good thing the Vig is always worth it!   *Feel free to keep the drinks coming too because the Vig Rig will take you home*  So convenient!

FAVORITE PARK YET!  You just have to be happy when you are in Freestone park... at the entrance there is a mini CARNIVAL with the cute ferris wheel, merry-go-round and kiddie train w/ railroad track that loops the entire park !  Make sure to watch the sunset on top of one of the formidable hills ... the carnival area lights up at night, which is really quite precious.    Its a huge park and happens to be celebration central... at least two quinceaneras and one wedding party there on a Friday afternoon.  Really lovely.   Great place for a picnic and ICE BLOCKING, which is still just as fun as when you were a kid!  This park actually has hills tall enough for decent ice blocking :)   *Don't forget to pack some bread to feed the smelly ducks in the lake*

I love dive bars and unlike many other dive bars, Monkey Pants is one with a younger crowd... one where you will not be the only person without an AARP card in your wallet.    The bartender looked like the main male character from (500) Days of Summer. Great. The drinks were cheap and strong. Even greater. This is probably the reason that I even thought the bartender looked like a quasi Joseph Gordon-Levitt.   Hands down, the BEST part of the night is when its time for 'free shots if you take off your shirt'.  Ideally this is meant for the ladies of the bar. The reality, however, is much more entertaining. Suddenly there are dozens of shirtless men (who really shouldn't be shirtless in any circumstance) parading around the bar.  Anyone first walking into the establishment would think they've entered a bad porno or some sort of explicit party.  Its hilarious but unfortunately that image will be forever burned into my memory, regardless of how much alcohol was circulating throughout my nueral cavity.  I had to hold back one star only because the crowd is a bit to 'frat boy' esque for my liking. Although it is par for the course being located on Mill Ave near ASU campus.

Dr. Fowler is the best dentist I have ever seen.  Myself and my family have been seeing him for years now, and the office has that 'small town' feel. Super friendly and comfortable.  Brenda at the front desk and his hygienists always knows me by name!   Dr. Fowler is so so nice and such a skilled dentist too.  My favorite thing is that he explains everything.  During a filling, for example, he will always check in with you to make sure you're doing okay.  At each step in the procedure he will explain what is happening. Takes away any anxiety or nerves.    My boyfriend was thinking about doing dental school and actually got to shadow Dr. Fowler for awhile as well!  It just seems obvious that Dr. Fowler loves being a dentist, so its no surprise that he does such great work. I will be truly sad when I go off to grad school next year and have to find a new dentist, I'm sure it will take awhile to find a suitable replacement.

One of my favorite downtown restaurants.  It seems many people feel this way ...consequentially the weekend nights can be pretty slammed... expect to wait a good half hour.  But its well worth it and besides you can get the evening started out right with a glass of wine from the bar.    I love the intimate yet sleek atmosphere.  There is exposed brick walls and beams on the ceiling, vintage yet modern interior... great lighting and little candles everywhere.  The exterior is just as inviting!   We opted for the chicken flatbread and pork chile verde...both of which were really excellent and fairly inexpensive for the quality and vibe of the restaurant.  I think this is one of my favorite things about St. Francis... you feel like you should be paying more than $10-15 for a meal... but then the bill comes and you are pleasantly surprised!    So guys.... remember St. Francis when you are choosing a date locale... its super cute, looks to be on the fancier side, but won't break the bank!

LOVE YUCCA!  Usually each night has a different theme ... and I am a sucker for loosely-based-theme nights, dancing, live music and reasonably priced drinks.  YUCCA HAS IT ALL!   Sunday was Cowboy/Western music/theme but without the actual cowboys so it ended up being a lot of great un-western (less intimidating than the real thing) people swinging around on the dance floor :)  Everyone there seems to be down to have a good time and dance no matter the type of music/theme/crowd.  Fantastic.   It is a great dive in Tempe and within walking distance from Time Out Lounge and Monkey Pants (two other GREAT bars).  So easy to do a little circuit comprised of the Tempe dive bar trifecta!   It always seems to be perfectly crowded... never dead and never 45min to get a drink...you will find a seat at the bar or a nearby booth but you have to do a bit of legwork.    The only complaint I have was that my martini extra dirty was too dirty.  It was quite green in fact.... and although it was drinkable it wasn't necessarily enjoyable.    *Its right on Southern and Mill but you got to overshoot the bar quite a bit and continue W on Southern before turning into the parking area*

It just didn't knock my socks off. Maybe I was expecting too much from some of the previous reviews but it was fairly mediocre in my book.  The restaurant itself was trendy but was nothing out the ordinary.... no memorable qualities or specific ambience.  Typical swanky/ expensive sushi place.    The waitstaff was definitely subpar.  Two different servers asks for our orders and it was apparent that they were as confused as we were and that no one was terribly organized.    The sushi was good, just not fantastic.  The rolls and menu options were very standard. Overall I think there are better sushi places out there to try, especially for the price tag.

New favorite Tempe bar!  I can't believe it has taken me so long to get to Boulders.  Badass beer selection. Badass drink specials!  I love bars that have daily specials. I would say Thursdays at Boulders are the best... 1/2 off almost all bottles of beer!  *But make sure you look at your tab because the bartender forgot to take of the 50% at first*  It is quite packed with a college crowd but falls into the lines of a 'Casey Moores' more than Mill Ave etc.    Have really great Trivia there on Tuesdays! Its a big place with ample seating and cheap drinks but the best part is that you can bring dogs on the outside patio.  I don't know any other bar that allows dogs on their patio! Its fantastic! Yay Boulders!!!!

On all fronts.. food, atmosphere, service, drinks... SakeBombers is just okay... and that might even be stretching the truth.    The sushi is sub-par as are the cocktails.  They do have lots of happy hour and reverse happy hour specials but they are again... mediocre.  Considering that I can walk here from my house and stumble home if need be... I still would rather go eat/drink at MANY other places instead.    The volcano roll is not very spicy as it is claimed to be and the wings are a bit soggy.    The atmosphere leaves much to be desired... Its like they didn't know if they were going for the asian theme or for a more swanky cool vibe... and they ended up in this bad middle ground that leaves you feeling confused.

As a recent grad who just quit her job, I find that I have a lot of time on my hands.... I am needing to fill my days while escaping the confines of my house.... so I've been on the hunt for local coffee houses to clear my head at.... Solo Cafe may be my favorite.  Solo Cafe is really fantastic.  The staff is super friendly and know their coffee. Everything I've ordered has been made perfectly, not to mention they DON'T CHARGE EXTRA FOR SOY, which probably pushes them into first place on my list.  I love the nutty taste soy adds to my coffee but refuse to pay extra for it at other coffee houses.    The atmosphere is perfect.  Its quiet enough to get work done, unlike a busy bustling Starbucks.  There is free Wifi and ample tables to work at.  They are even equipped with extra electrical outlets (which can be a huge detriment in other coffee houses)!!!!  Go Solo Cafe!!!  There are huge bookshelves (not filled with the usual trashy romance novels), cool local art, giant robots (yes, robots), comfy cushy couches and chairs if you are more in the mood to curl up with a book rather than ferociously write a paper.

I do love rum and should review the Rum Bar separately but both the Rum Bar and the Breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome!   Great recommendations from the waiter... Brown Stew Chicken and Jerk Chicken are really good... really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me! I'll take my plantains baked over fried any day! SO GOOD! Really great place to go for not so typical food!   The entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way.  Their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu, environment and service, which is rare to see in restaurant employees. Not to mention a perfect location ... very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix!

Great non-stop happy hour!  I firstly love Pearl because I work RIGHT across the street and there is nothing better than convenient sushi/drinks. Secondly, Pearl has a great outdoor/patio area and I will always opt for outdoor seating! Thirdly, I think I want to name my future dog Pearl  (although that name list is exponentially growing).  Their 'Bombers' selection is great and FUN! $4 you can get this funky little glass 'shot' of interesting drink concoctions.  As usual, I asked the bartender what she recommended and she basically made one up that wasn't on the menu (whipped cream vodka with root beer) and it was AWESOME! Also always $5 Sake Bombs!    The sushi at pearl is really quite good... lots of 'specialty' rolls aka lots of fried rolls etc.  Probably a good place if someone in the group is afraid of hardcore sushi/sashimi.    The only reason it gets four instead of five stars is for the crowd it attracts.  Ed Hardy shirt designs glitter in the bar lights and Louis Vuitton purses hang from the bar hooks.  Not my cup of tea but the cute little 'Bomber' drinks make up for the douch vibe :)

Very randomly ended up at Tuck Shop and so happy I did.  They have some great drink special ALL night long, not just happy hour times - made a mean Dark N Stormy.... yummy!  Its just the cutest, classiest, coziest, most welcoming establishment.  Makes you feel like you could spend hours upon hours there.  Our waiter/bartender was fantastic and I wish I caught his name.  The bar was full so we sat in the 'reading room' .... couches and chairs sectioned off from the bar and restaurant by bookshelves.    Although we were not there to eat, the entire place smelled SO GOOD and the food looked wonderful.  I can't wait to go back there for dinner!

Sidebar is always wonderful any and all days of the week but Sundays are the best nights to get discounted drinks and live GOOD music.    Sidebar is quite unassuming from a cursory glance.  Settled above chains like Pei Wei and Starbucks you might not even notice what is waiting for you upstairs. Once you figure out where the front door is you'll find yourself in a slightly trendier cenpho bar.    Inside is fairly sleek and modern with a long bar and then a small area with sofas and chairs.   I always love the random movies or music videos they play on their little corner TV.  Yes, the bar does have hooks under it for your purse!!!  Automatic bonus points for that simple, yet so appreciated amenity!  Hard to find in most downtown bars, but like I said, Sidebar is a bit swankier than your average cenpho dive.    Whisky Berry Sour is my favorite drink and the more you drink the harder it is to fish out those half muddled blueberries from the bottom :)  The patrons and bartenders alike are super friendly.  After a long day I was craving a whiskey berry sour and ended up chatting with another person and the bar and the bartender for way longer than just the quick drink I was expecting.  Always a welcomed change of plans. Unfortunately the food is nothing to write home about...your average bar type items.  Come for the cocktails and friendly vibe!

Always like bars with more than just a bar to drink at.  The lodge also sports corn hole and GIANT JENGA! Not to mention the pool table in the back!  There is both outdoor and indoor seating with a different (better) vibe than some other Scottsdale bars. It is quite 'lodgy' with lots of wood, rustic decorum and a cozy fireplace in the middle.  Giant whittled 'caveman-like' statues guarding the front door... how can you go wrong with that?   Wanted the vanilla mind eraser but it was only served as a shot... however the bartender made them into a drink for us, which was great and lets you not become too inebriated too quickly.  When the news of Bin Laden's death hit the bar everyone cheered and brought out their super patriotic selves.  It was quite fun!  Shots going around the bar and everyone was just in high spirits.  Very cool.

One of the best locations in Old Town.. tucked away on the park overlooking grass, flowers and fountains!  Its very quaint and lovely for being smack dab in the middle of Old Town.    Outdoor seating is perfect... lots of tables on the patio and even an upstairs patio with cute little lights!  Saying the bartenders are 'generous pourers' is an understatement.  I basically got two dirty martinis for the price of one... I watched her pour the vodka... and keep pouring... and not stop pouring.  I truly assumed she was making one for another patron as well... but nope... ALL FOR ME! Not to mention she gave me the remainder of the shaker to take outside as well!  I had a strong buzz after my 'one' happy hour drink.  My friend's glass of wine was almost poured full to the top of her wine glass!  Easily almost two 'regular' glasses of wine full!    Definitely worth checking out and I'll be going back again soon!

I don't usually write 1 stars but Moira does deserve this one.  My boyfriend and I went in last night for reverse happy hour, as I have wanted to check out Moira for some time.    We walked in and immediately the hostess said 'be right back' and left us awkwardly standing in the entrance for a good 5 minutes.  We were already thinking about leaving but were finally seated and each ordered a Sultry Saki from the cocktail menu.  After about 15 minutes without our drink, we were again seriously pondering just leaving.  I do understand when places are busy or short staffed. This really didn't seem to be the case at all.  Plenty of tables empty and a good amount of waitstaff in sight.    Finally our drink came and it was the weakest, worst, watery drink I have ever had.  When the ice melted in the drink, it still tasted the same.  Huge waste of $6.   The worst part of the evening came at the end when I got our bill.  I noticed that our waiter overcharged us for the fried tofu, which is under the $3 menu column.   ***Keep in mind that the happy hour menu is all black with white text.    However, the waiter was refusing to honor the $3 price because apparently in BLACK pen on the BLACK menu was a  HANDWRITTEN in $5 sign, that you could only see if you held your phone light over the menu.  I actually laughed and told him this is ridiculous and isn't going to happen.  Finally he obliged and took of the $2 overcharge.    Long story short, terrible drinks, terrible service and watch out of invisible amendments to the menu pricing.

I LOVE the Clarendon and therefore I love Gallo Blanco.  Its one of the few restaurants you can make a day-long experience out of.  Firstly, its part of the Clarendon, which is a phoenix landmark in itself.  Super retro hotel with an awesome pool and lounge chairs  for your relaxing pleasures.    After you swim/sweat up an appetite simply walk into the Gallo Blanco!  I am a sucker for 'all day breakfast' so thats what I stick to.  The Egg Torta is amazing as is the Chilaquiles Verdes. My friend did stray from the breakfasty foods and she raved about whatever she ordered as well!  The restaurant sticks with the retro vibe and does make you feel like you stepped into a post-mod Phoenix :)  Lovely.

This place will knock your socks (or your leather corset) off.  Its super fantastic and the gothic vibes start before you even walk in the door.  Even the signage for Sanctum is written in a font that screams 'I am a badass'.    The entire interior is classy gothic with this evil and dangerous undertone.  You feel like you are in a Disney movie villain's castle.  It is dark and mysterious with great lighting on the dance floor, art on the walls, seductive bathrooms (yes, public restrooms can officially be seductive) and carpeted bleachers.   Making out in bleachers has never been this edgy.   I have been wanting to go on a Wednesday or Saturday but ended up spending my time in Sanctum on a Friday night.  This night happened to be techno/trance party night.  The music was fantastic and the crowd was a good size... enough room to dance but you didn't feel like the only one out there doing isolated body rolls or dribbling and rolling your imaginary basketball around.   I can't wait to go back and try a Wednesday or Saturday night!

I live RIGHT down the street and have always thought Tops was simply a liquor store until I opened my eyes and realized there was this awesome little bar attached to the side.    Its a pretty tiny and narrow space but that definitely is part of its charm.  Its simple yet comfortable.  Only serves beer and wine but some really interesting and rare kinds.  My boyfriend tried the Dark and Orange beer and that is EXACTLY what it tastes like.  Its almost strange to have a beer taste like exactly what you would expect it to.... I am not a fan of dark beers but the flavor was so intriguing that I would order it myself next time.   They have wine and beer tasting all the time for fairly reasonable prices (that is my plan for next time) and a GIANT beer case in the back with all kinds of cool beers... Its like Whole Foods beer selection x 10!   .... uh there are just so many I want to try while relaxing on their comfy leather couches that I should probably go back tonight! :)

LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Fantastic coffee shop with fantastic atmosphere.  The staff plays great music!  the best part about sola is the fact that the staff seem like they actually want to be there too.  I find at other coffee shops (places in general) that the employees are simply counting down the seconds till clock-out.  Here, the staff seems like they enjoy the coffee shop, its patrons and are proud of it. Just great.   I am a huge fan of the Turkish brewing method they offer here.  They use cardamom as well and its absolutely fantastic.  I love trying new places as often as I can but I keep coming back to Sola because I crave their Turkish style coffee.   I don't know why anyone would pick the Starbucks in Old Town when Sola is just a few blocks up!

I never would have found this place without my Venezuelan friends but they swore that it was the most authentic Venezuelan food around... and they would certainly know.      I now love Chicha although it will kill any diet plan you may have since its full of sweet condensed milk, rice and cinnamon.  Definitely more of a dessert than a drink! Naturally the arepas (closest equivalence to a hamburger) are phenomenal (making My Arepa's name very appropriate).  Since My Arepa popped my Venezuelan cuisine cherry, my native friends ordered just about everything on the menu so I could sample it all.  I have to admit that everything dangerously good! Especially the arepas, empanadas, chicha and flan.   It must be authentic... no true/typical customer service...the waitstaff yelling across the tiny restaurant and my table shouting out orders and questions back into the kitchen... not your typical waiter/waitee relationship :)   But I wouldn't have wanted it any other way!   Make sure you know some Spanish, have Spanish speaking friends, or are just willing to point on the menu and hope for the best. No matter what your finger lands on, you'll be happy!

We went on a Thursday night, which happened to be open mike night.  It was packed!  We barely found a spot at the bar.  The place itself is quite large with lots of different 'areas' to hang out in.  The open mike night was a lot of fun and I'm glad we happened upon it.  Even our bartender got up to sing and he was awesome... probably the most talented of all the brave souls playing that night!  Drinks are really quite cheap and it wasn't even happy hour time.  Also every time a fire truck goes by (its adjacent to the fire department) drinks are $1 for fifteen minutes!  Pretty cool and appropriate special that they have enacted! The wings were actually quite good... at least crispy and not completely lathered in sauce.    Definitely more of a dive bar with random posters etc all over the walls and no frills to speak of but its also not that ghetto or intimidating.  It definitely suites a younger crowd and has bands playing there regularly.    Overall a really nice and necessary alternative to Mill Ave.... Tempe needs more bars like this!

I didn't eat here so my poor review cannot speak  for the food however it can speak for the service.  I love sitting outside so we sat outside and were basically forgotten about.  All we had was one drink each and we were there for over an hour simply because the waitress NEVER would come outside.  I finally had to go find her inside to give her my credit card.  I don't understand why it was so difficult for them to take my money.    It felt like we were a nuisance to the staff the entire time although we just had a simple beer.   I will not go back again but hopefully my experience is the exception to the rule.

So cute and truly best cappuccino I have had in Phoenix.  I have recently been going different places to study and read, and Carmel's my favorite place to go. They have a super cute garden patio in the back.  For some reason when I am there, I feel like I am on vacation. Leisurely sipping my perfect cappuccino, nibbling on a breakfast pastry, reading outside on the garden patio. I want to go tomorrow !   I can't wait to try more of the breakfast food there, as it looks super tasty. Always jealous of everyone's food when it comes out of the kitchen.    Oh yes, and they have free wifi too and comfy stools at the counter seating.

Its awesome.  For so many reasons. Below is my attempt to adequately detail all these reasons...  There is tons of parking which doesn't totally matter to me because I can walk here and stumble home.  Its also right next to the Apache/McClintock lightrail station... and this is why Tempe Tavern is the start of my birthday lightrail pub crawl! Perfection.    There is outside seating... in a particularly good locale for people watching.  The inside seating is really perfect too.  There is ample amounts for one thing and the entire place is just really comfortable. Makes you want to stay and hang out.  There is a stage... so apparently there must be music sometimes.  There is also a random and empty phone booth.  Rad. Not to mention the bathroom (only one stall but o well) was very clean.    The bar itself is smack dab in the center of the place and has seating on THREE sides... it makes the bar itself feel like the most important part of the place rather than just a counter shoved against a wall... like most bars.  The bartender that night was wonderful. Really friendly and talkative (not in an annoying way at all) and suggested drinks/made up drinks for us... always something I love at bars.    Drinks are crazy cheap.  2.50 wells I believe. This wasn't happy hour.  This is considered normal at Tempe Tavern.  They also have these really spicy hot peanuts out as bar food... pretty good.. especially with my cold cheap bottle of Stella  *I feel weird giving only four stars but I wish this place had a pool table or two*  central Tempe needs more places to play cheap pool and this place totally has the vibe for it.
