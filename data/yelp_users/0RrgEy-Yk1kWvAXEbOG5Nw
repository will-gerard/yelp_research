This place is fantastic! Now mind you I wouldn't go here when it is summer in the city - oh heck no! - but when it's not as hot it is great to go and see. Make sure you take some water with you and apply your sunscreen because even though we went when it was in the 70's we did get some sun and hubs got some red!  Oh, and do wear good walking shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover here.   You have an amazing array of cacti and other succulents.  The herb garden wasn't all that hot to me but it's there.  They have the volunteers out in different spots who will show you what this plant was used for and things like that.  There was a flute player out the day we went who captivated niece for a good long while.  It is not all flat ground, you will walk a bit uphill at some spots.  The giant insect statues were pretty cool to see but it was just the scenery period that was breath taking.  When the cacti are in bloom it has really got to be amazing.  Throughout the garden there are spots where they have information about the plants or the animals that are around and there are spots that have seats and shade; very necessary if you are really taking in the entire garden.  We were very fortunate as we got to see hummingbirds, cottontails, quails, squirrels, and a road runner.  It costs $18 for adults to get in UNLESS you have reciprocal membership from another garden.  We do, we got in free, woohoo!!!    If you are into the plant - and animal - life of the southwest then this is a place I highly recommend, just stay on the path and be careful when you back up to take a picture!  I'm still snickering about the fairy duster plant. Does this mean the plant dusts fairies or the fairies use it to dust with??  Too cute!

Stayed here in January (yeah I'm behind! I'm behind!) and was not too pleased.  It is conveniently located next to highway which made it great for getting to all of the other places we had to go as well as we could walk to some restaurants, the rooms were nice enough size, the staff was very nice and if you are a Hilton's Honor member that special lounge with breakfast and happy hour is great.  I wish I could remember the name of the woman who made the kick butt tequila sunrises because she was fantastic!    So why the meh? The condition of the rooms!!!! OMG they were tired and seriously in need of updating.  Robe hook in bathroom was broken, the water faucet in the bar area of the sitting room had so much corrosion on it I was afraid to use the water, the sofa bed in the same area had about as much cushion as a flat pillow, and there were so many visible wires for the lamps and television just hanging around it was ugly.  I would've asked about another room asap but when we checked in we were told they were booked solid.  I'd return only if they could give me an updated room otherwise it would be another hotel.

Went here for lunch with family and for a moment thought we will have a long wait but they were quick with getting folks in and seated.  The chips and salsa were placed on the table and while the salsa was thinner than I like the chips were nice and thin and crispy; I had to slow down on eating them.  Everyone ordered something different and nobody complained about their orders.  I ordered the steak and pork fajitas which came out sizzling and with a ton of peppers and onions which is ok if you like that - less veggies more meat for me, por favor.  The pork was ok but I wouldn't order it for fajitas again but that beef?  Next time nothing but beef for my fajitas - sooooooo tasty.  Prices are fairly reasonable for a strip mall joint and they do have a check-in yelp discount (I used!) My duo fajitas platter was 16$ and everyone else at the table ordered stuff in the $10 range.  Guess I was greedy ;)  We went twice here so I would recommend it.  Side note:  On the bill it has the percentages of tax listed for you and a note that says "In America it is customary to add a voluntarly (their spelling not my typo) tip to servers of 18% on parties of 8 or more....you may choose to tip more or less.  Thank you"  First time I've ever seen that on a bill but I ain't mad at them.

I know I'm dreadfully late with this review but as I keep all receipts, here we go!  They accommodated our entire family of six adults and one child at one long group of tables very well.  We got there first and had to wait for the rest of the gang which was fine as we watched food go past us and had our coffee and juice.  This place does fill up rapidly so either get there early or after the crowds have come and gone.  The service was good as was the food.  As it was family we all took bites of each others meals of hash browns, shroom omelet, and a nice salmon Benedict ($14.00).  Wish we had ordered the french toast because it did look very good.    There were no complaints from anyone at our table about food or service and for our entire party the bill was $68.00 which was for food and drinks.  The decor is a bit retro but nice and the view of Scottsdale while you nom is great...especially if you are from someplace that doesn't have mountains and palm trees.

It was the pink cowboy hat in the window that got my attention and glad I went in.  You want hats? This place has got them - all kinds, all sizes!  And that is good because one or two sizes does NOT fit all.  Plus they will measure your noggin to be sure.  I was going to go for a red cowboy hat since it was holiday time but fell in love with this red top hat which I rocked through December.  The hats were of good quality and they have a website where you can order them as well.    Cool place!

We were celebrating the inlaws anniversary and made reservations for the 6 adults and one child.  We ordered family style with everyone having their plate/bowl of eats that was passed up and down the table.  Three of us had food allergies and they took very good care of that - I appreciate them for it.  We had a bit of everything! Crab rangoon, beef and broccoli, curry ribs, seafood curry, pad thai, and more. Everything that I could eat was very good.  I really loved those ribs and the seafood curry.  The c-food curry was the most expensive at $18.99 while everything else clocked in around $12.00 - $17.00 (ok, the crab rangoon was $8.99 which I consider expensive considering how cheap it is at Chinese take out joints).  With that many plates and people the meal was expensive at $152.80 but we all left full.  My only complaint with them was that it's Scottsdale! It was summer time! And either their AC was not on or overwhelmed and even with some over head fans and the sides open...it was not very comfy in there.  And add to it spicy food and well...a lot of water was downed.

The store is a sizable Neiman's and I cannot report on anything other than the department I made a beeline for - the shoes!  I went just after Thanksgiving so there were SALES! whoop whoop whoop!  Hubs was told to find a seat and wait.  The best time to go shopping for shoes at any Neiman's is when they have the racks up.  You can and will find amazingly enough good bargains on some killer kicks.  This NM's has a big shoe department with plenty of brands and styles ranging in price from not so high to nosebleed high.  They had brands here that I've not seen at the other NM I used to frequent often.  That I liked for I got to try on brands I've seen online but wondered how they fit.    In the end I settled on a pair of chunky heeled lace up Hunter boots that I have not seen before nor since in any store.  Sale + selection = shoe bliss!  The only thing I did not like about this store is that the staff was about as dry as the desert air.

This place should be called Salt Salt instead! OMG! I ordered the hot and sour soup and the amount of salt in it was enough to feed a small ocean. I couldn't eat it!!!  They did take it back and took it off our bill.  I got the yellowtail sushi roll instead and those were the tiniest rolls I have ever gotten - and I consider myself a sushi fiend!  The rolls I get at Whole Foods are bigger than these were!    Hubby ordered the pepper beef and it wasn't too bad.  Only reason we ate here was because we were hungry and the deli place we really wanted to go to was closed already :(  Server was friendly and the wait to get in wasn't too long, but we will never go here again.

Let me start out by saying my husband is British so we just HAD to go here.  As we were staying at the MGM Signature this called for either a bus ride or a cab.  Cab to here was about 12$ w/tip (more or less).  When you get to the place it looks like an old old building and inside it was old looking too.  But I was told that was the idea by the hubby.  We got there between crowded times so we could sit where we wanted to.  The place has tons of memorabilia all over the walls - old signs, flags, newspaper clippings, etc. And chalk boards over the beer taps that were advertising all sorts of things.  We had a scotch egg for an appetizer (not too bad) hubby had a steak and kidney pie and I had the lamb with taters, carrots, and peas and this ginormous yorkshire pudding.  And a ton of gravy.  Hubby was in pie heaven and I was scraping off gravy from some pretty good lamb.   They have a great selection of beer and I had my first hard cider - Blackthorn.  I am now officially hooked on cider.  The stuff is sneaky and like my mum in law says 'it will knock your legs out from under you!'  It just made me a bit giggly, but I bet if I had had more than one............ ;)  They called a cab for us to take us back to our hotel even.  This place is way cool and the food is pretty darn authentic.   The next time we are out in Vegas we are so going back!

Well, we went back and it's still good!  A pint is a good pint! That Yorkshire pudding is still huge.  The food is still yummy and this is the only place in the states that my dear hubs can find his favorite steak and kidney pie.  Plus, I forgot my camera bag (had camera but forgot the bag) and we walked off to go play pinball.  When we discovered it was missing I called them and our server had put it back in the office for safe keeping.    Pints, steak and kidney pie and keeping my bag for me? Good show!

We were fortunate enough to have our hotel just a couple of blocks away from here (hubs would disagree with me on this  LOL).  Beautiful mall, great architecture and quite the eclectic mix of stores.  You have the high end icons like Neiman's and Barney's and Jimmy Choo but you also have Forever 21 and H&M.  There is the mandatory food court as well as some other nice restaurants attached and even nicer ones across the street.  If nothing else, this place is great for just walking around in (and sometimes getting turned around from it's configuration) and browsing which I would imagine is a good thing when its searing hot outside.  Wish I had had more time to explore but I got hung up in a few stores.  When we return to Scottsdale I will so be returning here and with more space in my suitcase!

You're in Vegas so yeah, you are going to spend (ie. lose) money.  So why not go old school and spend some quarters but have fun doing it!  It's kind of a dumpy joint but who cares!  No cost to get in and it's jammed packed in there with pinball machines. There's also a few claw machines and video games too.  The machines date from the 50's on up and cost you from one quarter up to two dollars to have as much fun as your skill will allow you.  It was fantastic seeing machines with the old fashioned clink clink clink counters along with modern machines with all of the goodness Bally could shove into a machine.  Each machine also has a sign on it giving all of the details about it which was very interesting.    I came in humming Elton John's pinball wizard and after putting a fiver into the change machine to get my quarters I went nuts!  Oh yeah, I was putting body language into those flippers :)  Depending on how good you are at the games you can get away with having fun for a long time for far less than what you'd put in a slot machine.    Get off the strip and take your money here to have some good old fashioned fun.

I've been in several of these stores but never found anything I liked that fit until here!  And on sale too no less.  We were there over the December holidays when things were on sale.  The sales person was very helpful and helped me pick out a beautiful skirt that I just wore this past Easter...and received tons of compliments on it!  Be warned that their sizing is different and you will have to figure that one out by asking or reading the charts.  Their stuff is trendy and not cheap - but not super expensive either.  It's a fun store with great staff and pretty nice clothing for men and women.

Hubs took me here for my birthday and OMG I was one happy camper!  Have been to various shows out in Vegas, but this was my first foray into and "opera" type of venue.  The theater is unlike any other in Vegas (make sure if you go to get Golden Circle seats!!!) the set is amazing, the performers are top notch, and the music is wonderful.  Search for ticket bargains online for better pricing....but do go!  Don't get toooooo close to the stage for a couple of reasons.  One: you will miss so much of the production.  Two: When the pyrotechnics go off you may have a bit of a cough afterwards.  And hopefully you won't be sitting anywhere near crass, drunk, dumb asses like the couple behind us.  What a dickweed!

When we were there around Thanksgiving time we asked the front desk staff to recommend a place to eat nearby the hotel and they suggested this place.  The decor is charming and it went downhill from there.  The hostess acted like she was doing us a favor leading us to our table.  The main server was short on attentiveness and personality but his assistant was a joy.  He made sure water glasses were filled and more bread was brought out when we asked for it and he always had a smile.  We saw him more than the main in white jacket server guy.    The food was no big deal for the price.  It was just adequate.  Where they totally dropped the ball was desert!  I ordered the warm pineapple upside down cake.  I assumed warm cake meant it was brought out to you warm.  Ummmmmmmm, no! It was cake that was brought out to the table and then presented flambe.  Now flambe is one thing and I have no issues with it.  Having the dish placed in front of me, the server pouring the flammable liquid on it and splashing me with it and then lighting the thing in front of my OMG am I going to have a Michael Jackson hair on fire moment here - not cool!!!  The pineapple on the cake melted so much that it was too gooey to chew and the taste of the rum was more than I could take.  Normally when something is presented flambe they pour the liquid and light the dish AWAY from you and the alcohol evaporates enough before you try and eat it.  I could only manage a couple of forkfuls before I shoved it away.  I contacted the management later and we had a nice discussion especially about how not to scare the *&^% out of a customer with flames.  Would we go back to this place when we return to Arizona? How about no.

WARNING! The portions here are stupid large! So unless you are a very big eater (or a sumo wrestler in training) share a plate or make sure you have some place to put the leftovers.  This place is located in Imperial Palace which in itself is a pretty fun kitchy kind of joint.  You have to take the escalator behind the bar up to get to it and you will wait no matter what time of day or night you go.  The servers are nice and very fast and they have to be fast.  This place is always packing.  We went for lunch but we did see some breakfast items go past us.  Pancake I swear was size of hubcap; chicken and waffles had to be about a foot high on the plate.  Hubby had the BBBLT sandwich which had almost half a head of lettuce, almost a whole tomato, about 8 slices of bacon, and milk bread that was about 2 inches thick. It came with a steak knife stabbed in the middle holding it together.  I had the cob salad platter - errrrr I mean plate.  Big chunks of everything in it including a whole avocado and a biscuit about the size of a softball.  A lot of people were gawking at other tables food orders cause they were all huge.  One guy at a table behind us just stared at his plate for awhile before he figured out how to attack it.  The prices aren't too bad, but you get food enough and then some for what you pay.    Come hungry - leave happy and waddling off.  Good times!!!

Stayed here for the second time a couple weeks ago and was very happy....well, with a few exceptions.  We got there very early and would've had to wait for our room to be ready (we were scheduled for tower 1) we opted for getting a room right then and there - at 10:30 in the morn - in tower 3.  Yeah, longer walk but immediate room.  Glad we got #3 because that weekend was insane with 20somethings there to party.  The room was great, no noise issues and we clocked it at 20 mins. to go from tower 3 through MGM and onto the strip...but that includes having to dodge slow people and those just standing around gaping.  We discovered if you walk out of #3 past the guard gate and onto Harmon you can walk a couple blocks and right into the Miracle Mile shops.  The tub in the suite was great after a long day walking around.  Pool #1 opens around 9 with the other two at 10. Pool #2 was the biggest and had a life guard on duty. It was also more of a family pool, but still nice.  On weekends they have a pool party at pool 1 which we went to and were not impressed.  Music, drinks, and people just laying about.   We knew about the resort fee but what a rip-off.  Ok so you get the coffee and tea in the suite (whoop de doo) and you get two pissant sized bottles of water a day (you get a bigger one for a buck from the street vendors) and you get use of the gym (ok if you are that sort, I figure hoofing it up and down the strip is exercise enough) and you get free wi-fi BUT only if you bring your own.  If you forget to bring yours like I did - then you have to pay for the internet in your room or in the business center OR you can rent a laptop for $20!  Gimme a damn break! You got my 20$ a day resort fee already - geeze!!!  Our tv in the living area was out of order and we called down to have it fixed thinking it would be awhile, but they came right up!  I would still kill to have a kitchen at home like the one in the suite.  The entire place is non-smoking (hooray) but plenty of people sit outside to fire up.  The front desk people are a bit dry, but when you walk up and down the walkway staff people will smile at you and say hello - go fig!  All in all...we love this place and highly recommend it.

It's packing but you can still get in quickly which is a good thing if there are 6 of you and you are hungry.  Pretty standard fare but it is reasonably priced and they get it to the table pretty darn quick.  Will say they do make some significantly large enough pancakes.  I suggest the blueberry ones - YUM!  And they will keep the juices, water, and coffee coming as long as you want them.  Even though we like trying new places to eat when we travel we seem to gravitate to this place each time we are in Scottsdale.

Picked this hotel because it was within walking distance of Old Scottsdale andpretty much easy access to anything else we wanted to get to.  The rooms are interesting because they aren't like your typical hotel room.    Platform bed with a duvet but no top sheet, a long counter to put things on and one set of drawers to stow your stuff.  The closet has just a pull curtain on it but a safe and iron and ironing board (seriously? ironing clothes in all that heat????) And the bathrooms have this smoked glass on a sliding door as well as around the shower.  Ok if you like casting shadows but what the hey!  The shower is nice and big and the water pressure and temperature are great.  Just no place to prop your leg if you wish to shave.  If you get a room with a shower and tub the shower is smaller but that tub is great for soaking a weary body after a hike.  The patios and balconies are awesome because you have a table with chairs as well as this can fit two chaise lounger for sitting out and catching some rays or just chilling.  My only complaints were that there seemed to be only one ice machine and it was near the pool and on a weekend that was very busy they had part of the parking lot that was next to our building blocked off for some mustang and motorcycle storage/event.  Not cool for when you come back in late and have to park on the street!    When we come back to Scottsdale we will keep this place high on our list of possible stays.

Actually they are more of a 4.5 but lets get on with the review.  Decided to book this place based on Yelp reviews and the central location of where we needed to be for the holidays.  Right on a main street, not far from any highway you needed to get to in order to go somewhere else and just a couple of blocks from a killer mall.  If you are going to stay here I recommend joining their Kimpton club thingie before you go, it will get you a few extra goodies like $10 credit for the honor bar and a couple of free drink coupons.  I don't recall if the wifi was free or part of the club, do check it out and it is all over the property.  The grounds are beautiful and the pools were very nice.  From the moment we checked in I felt like I had made a great decision booking here.  Wonderful front desk staff, everywhere I went someone would smile or in some cases hold the door open for me; it was great.  And the evening happy hour of wine and hot toddies for free - hot damn!  The free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate in the morning was great too.  They honored all of my requests before arrival (what floor, the view, pillows) and I had absolutely no complaints about the place but one!  The restaurant in the hotel! One night when we went there (Thanksgiving night to be exact) for a later evening snack as we had pigged out at relative earlier in the day, the server we had was not making me happy!  He spent more time fawning over his other table like they owned him or something.  Mind you, its not like the place was full considering it was a holiday night, but this guy was very neglectful, short of personality (but he was grinning his butt off at the other table), and when we wanted to pay and go we had to wait and wait until he showed up again.  The food was good the service sucked!  Other than the sorry service that one night, I would happily return to this hotel when we go back to Scottsdale.

For the second time visiting, when I needed tee's for the little guys at a good price I went here.  Reasonably priced and a great selection.  I get them the glow in the dark desert animals every time and they love them.  Yeah it's a cheesy tourist place but if you want to pick up a souvenir that says Arizona or Scottsdale then I highly recommend this place.  They've got just about everything in there.   I wished I had picked up the stuffie kokopelli for myself when I was there, it was so cute.

I kept staring at the buttes when we were over at the botanical garden and finally I just couldn't stand it any longer especially after I saw some people hiking up the rocks. I can only comment on the trails part as that is all we did, we just went for a hike on the trails.  They have a map at the parking lot listing the different trails; some foot some bike some paved some natural.  We didn't go at sunset and I wish we had as we were told the sunset from up on the rocks is beyond awesome.  Watch out for the mountain bikers, they can whip past you with speed that just amazes me as I was busy trying to make sure I did not fall off any paths.  You can and many many do go off the trails and climb up into many of the crevices and holes in the buttes or to stand on the very top of some of them.  Braver souls than I!  We were within 50 to 100 feet of the "summit" of one of the buttes and I chickened out and elected to just walk around some more.  Spectacular views from up  high of the rest of the city and great photo opps.  Have the right shoes and proper clothing (the sun will beat down on you) and go out there and enjoy nature and get some exercise.  And be neat and take your trash out with you.  Like another reviewer noted, it was sad to see some broken glass and a few empty water bottles strewn about.

What can I say.......its a Cirque show so you know ahead of time what you will be getting, but it is a bit different than the other Cirque shows.  Different in that although you do have the people hanging from the ceiling and folks flipping up and down, you also have some roller skating that is out of this world and pretty good dancing.   My fondness for the show is because I am a die hard Beatles fan, so seeing this was a happy jaunt down memory lane. I even bought the CD.

Would I go back here if/when I return to Scottsdale? Heck yeah!!!!!  When we were there last November there were 5 adults and one child in our family group wandering around the area looking for something to eat.  The one place we tried to get into you couldn't get in without a crowbar so we wandered past this, took a look at the menu and said why not!  So glad we did!  Good sangria, interesting patio area (felt more like an alley but cool), great chips and salsa, and good food at a good price.  No one, not even the kid complained about their food.  And this was the first time in my life I had fajitas with zucchini in them! YUM!  Plus, most veggies that come with fajitas are usually limp beyond limp and on the bland side.  Theirs had some spice to them.    With drinks and food our whole bill for all of us was around 100$.  Not bad for a place in Old Scottsdale.

I  really wanted to go for 4.5, but no halfsies.  Every time we go to Vegas I HAVE to come here and see what the latest display is.  It has almost always been amazing (one time it was a bit lame, but I think it was about trees or something that time).  When they do people it is really a sight to behold.  If you aren't into flowery art then you will be in and out in 5 to 10 mins....unless its really crowded and that time may get upped if its crowded with people standing in the middle of walkways taking pictures like no one else might want to walk that way.  If you really like this type of thing - or if you are one who wants to take snaps, but not block the pathways - then you could spend a bit more time there.  The Christmas displays are always the best to me.  I would put it on the list of must sees when visiting Vegas.

Another interesting and different store in the Palazzo.  And another shop that I can never afford to buy anything from but hubs and I had a grand time admiring the selections in here.  I felt like I had stumbled into the stash of books hidden away by that person in the movie Fahrenheit 451.    Some were original or first copies, some were signed but all were amazing to drool over.  I enjoyed the Winnie the Pooh books so much as they took me back to my childhood.  There are just so many great books in here; enough to give any bibliophile the vapors!

Tired from a long flight in and stomach was in a different time zone.  We wanted to try something new so we went here.  Not too bad!  Friendly service, good prices, margarita wasn't bad, the patio was great to sit on but the happy hour stuff was nice!    Lots and I do mean lots of people were rolling into here after work for happy hour.  We ordered some nachos as an appetizer that we could've had for a meal.  Cheese, beans, meat....they were loaded!  Loved my calamari taco more than the fish one and hubs enjoyed his big burrito!  The next table had some chicken wings that looked darn good too.  Then there was dulce de leche cake for desert!  Oh yeah..............

Imagine my surprise and delight when I rounded a corner and saw a whole entire store of Jimmy Choo's!  Happy shoe diva alert.  I hadn't been in a self standing JC's since London.  All of the delightful shoes were in here and quite a few called out my name.  They tend to run more narrow than a lot of other brands and often their styles don't fit me...not all thankfully, but a lot.  Again you will have the issue (if you even have said issue) of them having some shoes the big stores (ie. Neiman's) don't have and that is good vs. the big stores having better sales.  Pick your weapon of choice and go have fun.  If nothing else, go in and dream.

I had to do a double take when we walked past this store in the mall.  Yes, it is their attempt to be "apple-ish" but I didn't care.  It was geeking time for us PC people..  It was great to see all of their new things there to play with to my hearts content, but no, I don't care how fantastic that mouse is and what it does (and it was very cool) I am entirely too cheap to pay $80 for it.    You can play with things to your hearts content and the workers are there to help you with any questions you may have.  I had a ball playing with the Xbox kinect and totally forgot I was in a mall when I was busting some moves playing Dance Central 2.  I have GOT to get me one of these!!!!  If you are a PC person then this place is fun if for nothing more than just going in and viewing the goodies....and playing with them.

After riding - errr driving - the Apache Trail and you're parched and hungry, come here!  The place is a hoot to behold and everyone is friendly.  When the weather is nice they have music on the patio and the prices aren't bad.  We didn't eat anything, just had some drinks, but I saw one of their famous burgers go by and wished we hadn't had a big breakfast!    Seriously, if for nothing more than a drink, stop here and see this place and maybe put your autograph on a dollar bill to go up with the thousand of other ones up there!

Never in my entire life of renting cars from various rental agencies have I had such a crappy ass experience.  Normally my reviews are void of swear words but this place has me wanting to unload on them!  I rented from them via Orbitz and from the looks of things online comparing different places they were the least expensive and offered the cars we were used to driving.  The price for 5 1/2 days over Thanksgiving was quoted at $187something plus the fees.  I still figured with the fees it wouldn't be too bad.  WRONG!  My inner get a clue was telling me to run to another counter when we got there and noticed nobody was in line to get a car but one couple who hadn't bothered to reserve one.  But we were tired and needed to get going so we went with them.  Guy acted like he was doing me a favor renting me the car as he went through the myriad of this fee, that fee, the fee for the fee, the fee for me to sit here fee, etc.    Not knowing what the taxes and genuine Phx fees were we just nodded and went on with him but felt like we were being robbed blind by a bandit.  Then he started with the pressure tactics of insurance.  We told him no extra we have our own.  He pressed harder saying that if something were to happen to the car and it had to be taken in for repairs we would be charged for each day it was out of service.  WTF???  Then he started with some other so called Phx fees and hubs just said oh the hell with it just pay the extra.  NEVER have I heard of such nonsense from other rental agencies.  Then he asks who will be driving, I said both of us - more fees!  WTF?? We are presented  with the final estimate and that $187 went up to over $500 for a damn compact car!!  Hubs said screw that and take my name off the car.  The guy tells us he had already put it in BUT as a FAVOR to us he would re-run it.  Gee! Thank you ever so f*****g much!  The cost was now $430.  We leave feeling robbed and violated and head to the garage to get our car.  A worker in the garage took a look at our paperwork and pointed in the direction of the row of cars we could pick from.  Every last damn car had some sort of dings or scratches on them including some that had stickers on them stating here is a ding needing repair (not out of service I see huh?) a lot were not that clean inside, and a couple had a mystery odor about them.  We finally picked one car and tried in vain to start it.  It wouldn't turn over and we couldn't figure out why until a van of employees drove up and one guy yells out "That one has a dead battery!"  Again I repeat - charge a person for how many days a car is un-rentable and here one is dead in the to be rented line? WTF!  We finally settled on a car that looked like someone had used a cactus to wash it with; scratches on it for days.  The car worked fine for our purposes and when we returned it early they did not give us any money off for it, but if we had turned it in late there would've been a fee for that and then some.  Hell will freeze over and they will host the winter Olympics there before we ever rent from not so Thrifty again!  Do not rent from here!

Wandering around the avenue killing time we were getting hungry when the aroma of beef wafted by my nose...that and some pumping jams.  "We have got to follow the smell and sound and find out what this place is!" I exclaimed.  Led us to RnR.  It was a Sunday and the noise was loud on the lower level as the games were on.  The host asked us - after seeing the look on my face - if we wanted to go upstairs where it wasn't as loud.  YES!  Upstairs on the outside balcony overlooking the street in November? YES! It was still loud but I didn't care I was enjoying the warmth.  I had the slider sampler and hubs had a blue cheese burger;  Beef good - beef friend! It was all very tasty.  Hubs also had the dirty chips.  The chips weren't bad, just a bit too sloppy for me, he ate them up.   Then the live DJ started spinning some tunes I hadn't heard in awhile and all I could do was stand up and start head nodding and singing along.   I noticed they had some good looking breakfast items and that day the drink special appeared to be a really big pitcher of mimosas.  Good times!  When we return to Scottsdale we will hit them up again.

Took a chance on this place and glad I did.  The seating outside (earlier in the morning mind you) was nice but there is seating inside as well.  I had the Lorraine omelet with potato chunks and a small salad and even though there wasn't enough bacon in it for me (bacon fiend here) the Swiss that was in there? C'est magnifique!   Not the speediest service on the block but it was good enough.  Just had to make them take notice that more water was necessary.  I mean it is Scottsdale during 100+ degree weather.    The prices are very reasonable - my omelet was only $8.75 - and an OJ was less than $2.  I saw another table get their French toast order and was determined to try it the next time I'm in town.

Went here back in June for a family celebration and as someone who love tapas I was very disappointed.  We were a group of six adults and one child.  Reservations were made but where they put us really bit!  We were at a long table right in front of the service area with - in my case - our backs against a rail that separated the two areas.  It was too close for me.   Although it wasn't terribly crowded the servers seemed to be in a constant state of rush rush rush.  We all ordered different tapas plates so that we could eat family style and that's when I realized this place wasn't that hot.  The lamb tapas I ordered was greasy, the ham was tasty but rather dry, the bread was the best thing other than the manchego cheese, tiny little albondigas, and the servings were really small tapas! And then the prices were just ridiculous!  An ice tea was $4.00, the cheese plate was $9.00, and the paella was $20.00 for some meh paella with little bits of meat, etc. in it.    The flamenco dancer was nice and took our little one up on stage to dance with her; she enjoyed the heck out of that.  But other than that I would not go back here.  There has got to be better tapas elsewhere.

I was here back in January (yeah I am terribly late with this review) and at first I wasn't too happy with them because they didn't open until 9am and we needed some stuff to be someplace else at 9am.  But when I had a medical emergency they came to my rescue!    First of all it's a Walgreen's - what more need be said.  My experience was with the pharmacy department.  Long story short....got sick, needed inhaler, forgot to pack inhaler, freaked out! Went to CVS at first because I usually get my scrips there.  Guess what? Not for the inhaler! Had to call doctors office and get him to phone in the prescription.  Had him call it in to Walgreens because I just happened to have the phone number from a receipt on me.  Get to Walgreens and go to pharmacy.  I tell them could they hurry up the inhaler I was in distress.  They said it would be 15mins but they'd try for sooner.  I walk away dejected and wheezing but by the time I got to the front of the store to read some magazines it was done!  Thanked them profusely, used inhaler, went back to hotel to rest.  Never forgetting to pack it again!!!!

Not that I will ever drive past here again (but who knows!) this was the coolest QT I have EVAH been in!  No seriously!  They had food selections like I've never seen before - I am now in love with bacon jerky - even the roller food looked somewhat appealing.  You could fill up here for the zombie apocalypse they have so much stuff but when I saw all the options you could get for coffee including a whipped topping - joy!!  And they had plenty of gas pumps too.    Yeah, I got a good surprise in Surprise at this gas station ;)

Wandering around trying to find our way back to our hotel and I saw this gallery and squealed! It was the 6.5 million dollar man!!!  He apparently does not make small prints as the pieces in his gallery were all quite large but stunning.   As a photographer I was drawn in and studied each piece and all I have to say is - I want to learn his marketing techniques! Seriously!!!  There was no way in the world I could afford anything of his but it was wonderful to see his images up close and personal and not in a magazine or online.    Beautiful images and would I love to pick his brain.  I'd go back again to see his new works anytime.

What would you get if Panera and Piada hooked up and had a baby? This!  The first one I wandered into hungry was further up the road and I was craving a breakfast sandwich...they said sorry breakfast stops being served at 10.  Mind you it was 10:03 when I was in there.  Not happy.  But I tried the one here because the inlaws wanted to go in.  Not bad at all.  Other than not knowing where to order anything because there aren't any signs that say Order Here, the staff was friendly and the salad I had constructed for me was good.  Everything but for a few items can be included in your salad (I wanted shaved parmesan and that cost me 25cents more)  And their asiago bagel sandwiches? Oh yeah!

We flew on USAir and their terminal in the airport is SEVERELY lacking in food options.  Oh sure they are working on opening a few more joints this year but at the time our options were limited so we went in here.  We paid $30 for two sandwiches, 2 sodas, and one salad.  GEEZE!!! And the sandwiches were more bread than anything else but as I said, in this terminal the options were limited.  One positive I could say for them as that they got your stuff out to you quickly.  I knew we should've eaten something in the area before going through security.

While the sign out front advertised just the right kind of breakfast we were looking for the service left a bad taste (and potentially dangerous one) in my mouth.  It wasn't a cheap meal ($3.50 for coffee and $4.00 for hot tea) but the food like the steak and eggs and the breakfast combo did taste pretty good.  Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of stars was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.  So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.  He swore it was and then walked off with it and poured another table some coffee.  Had to get another person to take that cup away and give me the real decaf.    If you don't have your carafes marked and/or don't know or understand the difference between regular and decaf coffee then you don't need to be a server.

Initially it was a bit scary to me but once I got used to being up in the air it was a breeze (pun not intended).  I booked the flight for myself and hubs and for a moment it looked as if it wasn't going to happen due to rain coming into Phoenix.  Of all the times!!!  We were called and asked if we wanted to change the date but we couldn't so it was left to see if the original date and weather would cooperate.  They did!  Kevin is a hoot which made for a great ride.  Very professional but also fun which helped when I was still nervous.  He explained many things about ballooning and its history and what things we were floating over (beware the jumping cholla cactus) and even told us there was an app for wind currents (which proves there is an app for every thing!). Our ride was a sunrise one and it was amazing to see the sun come over the mountains and watch the other balloons that were also flying that day to inflate and rise. But our ride rocked as his will only carry up to 4 people plus him unlike the others which looked like egg crates full of people - they can carry up to 14 at a time some of them.   As it turned out it was just us and Kevin so it was fantastic.  Seeing the world from 5000 feet in the air in a basket is something else!!!!  If you want an experience to cross off your Bucket List or for a special occasion - I highly recommend Kevin.  You will not regret it and like me will want to do it again!

Two levels of clothing!!!  Did I mention two levels?? Walking in the mall to cool off I saw the sign and immediately took off.  So many options so little time and the prices are all very very good.  Most of the styles will appeal to the younger (ie. 20's and 30's) set but there is enough to chose from that even if you aren't in that bracket you can find something.  I fell in love with their full pleated skirts!    No breaking of the bank or melting of the plastic when you shop here...unless you want to.

I LOVE Garrett's popcorn! Love love love! It hurts my very being that it's not in my home state so I make a run for it whenever I am in a city that does have it...that is when I don't order tins to be delivered to my home (where I hog it!)  They are in the Miracle Mile Shops and I was beaming with joy when I finally found them.  It was right before we had to head out to the airport because I wanted something besides pretzels and cheese crackers to eat.  The woman who waited on me was so very sweet, making sure the ratio of cheese to caramel (Chicago Mix baby!) was as I directed it and she packed it up so well that it made it onto the plane, where I munched happily, and even home for a day.  You must try their popcorn - happiness is yellow cheesy fingers :)

Sushi isn't cheap no matter where you go unless you hit a place with a luncheon special.  Having said that, this place makes pretty good sushi but they need to work on their service.  When we came in the young lady at the front desk seated us and then went off to get our drink order.  I noticed that the entire time we were there no one manned the front desk and one guy came in and stood there for the longest and almost left if he hadn't gone into the bar to ask for service.  Their hearts are in the right place but they really need to learn how to run things smoother.  We got hot tea from one girl without a lid.  She said she couldn't find it - really? But when our server came back she noticed it and went to get us another pot that had a lid.  My GF and I each ordered miso soup and upon noticing how good it felt to our dry throats they kept bringing us more - score!  They kept us in tea until we were floating and we each had two rolls which were yummy.  I was disappointed that they didn't have white tuna nor a fish/avocado combo.  They did make me a salmon avocado roll but I had to pay 50cents extra for it.  They do have some really creative rolls which my friend tried but I stuck with my basic rolls.  I'd come back but they really really need to work on running the business more efficiently.  That may cost them in the end.
