I injured my knee on a Wednesday and got in to see the PA-C of an orthopedic surgeon at TOCA the next day. I don't know why everyone is having such a tough time scheduling appointments with TOCA. I called them right after my injury at around 3 in the afternoon and got right in. I think if you avoid "peak" times when calling the office, you have the best chance of getting an appointment with the smallest amount of frustration. Everyone knows that traffic is greatest around 8AM and 5PM because everyone hits the road at the same time. Phone traffic is no different. Also, I tend to feel a sense of security when I walk into a busy doctor's office as opposed to one that is completely empty. The ratio of doctors to patients in AZ is fairly high to begin with. If they aren't busy, I start to wonder why and my imagination will usually lead me to conclusions that aren't good for my health.  Justin, Dr. Cumming's Physician Assistant, did a great job with his initial assessment and getting me scheduled for an MRI. Remember folks, with the rising cost of medical schools, more candidates are choosing to go the route of PA or NP and it's not uncommon to be assessed by these highly skilled individuals.   I had a vein issue that they did not take lightly, rushed me in for an ultrasound, and even called me the day after my visits to make sure I was doing OK. Dr. Cumming's has great bedside manner and both he and Justin took the time to educate me on the overall process and what was going on with my knee. Both of them were on hand for my surgery at Piper Surgery Center in Scottsdale, AZ. They furthered this excellent experience by taking the time to help my wife understand the meds I was taking and the care that I would need post-op.   Lastly, the staff and everyone involved with my experience continue to be nothing more than helpful on my road to recovery.

My wife and I stayed there to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary and the entire staff did a spectacular job making it a special stay. Our reservations were perfectly square and we were warmly welcomed upon arrival. The concierge provided us with a welcome packet and she was also able to scrounge up a 25% off coupon for Fogo de Chao. She even called ahead to let them know we were running behind for our reservations.   The gym was adequate and the cooling towels were a nice touch.   They would have earned a 5 stars had they not had miscommunication between the front desk, concierge and restaurant on the times and availability of their breakfast and Sunday brunch.   Overall, it was a great stay and we'll more than likely be back again.

Went out this morning for some sporting clays. I don't have much experience with other sporting clay facilities, but this one has, probably, everything that I would want. The counter attendant was great and pointed out that if we just buy 100 clays on a single card that we would save money over buying 50 a piece on two separate cards. Each station is fairly challenging. Solid mix of throws and it seems like no two stations are alike. They have 3 courses that cater to skill levels from beginner to mastery. We were on the rattlesnake/intermediate level course today. It is a clean, well-run facility and it helps when shooters properly dispose of their hulls. Had a great time.

We have been going to Fogo on a regular basis for quite some time. On this last visit, my wife and I were celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary. Marco, the head server did an excellent job welcoming us back and getting us situated. The food, as always, was wonderful and they were very busy on this Saturday evening. I would recommend the picana, ribeye, bacon wrapped filet, and beef ribs. I'm a rib lover and not having to handle the large beef ribs is a plus. The salad bar is always great, but the meat is really where it's at.   The bar is fully stocked and I haven't been disappointed by any of the drinks that I have ordered. The wine list is fairly extensive as well. I usually order a Guarana Soda for the drive home to give me a bit of energy after such a large and very satisfying meal. This visit did not disappoint and the extra care exhibited on this special occasion earns them 5 stars. Excellent job!

I would give them no stars, but we are forced to give something. Here is letter that I sent to their corporate office and sums up my visit:  I haven't been to this KFC in a while and decided to visit this afternoon. After paying for my order, I noticed a .39 "SVC FEE". I questioned it and the lady at the counter said that the owner has decided to start charging the fee a couple of months ago because the merchant service company you use has increased fees. I take issue with this for 4 reasons: 1 - I was not notified ahead of time of the fee and was not allowed to opt out by buying lunch elsewhere. THIS IS ILLEGAL AND THE STATE ATTORNEY AND OTHER CONSUMER WATCH GROUPS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF YOUR PRACTICES TODAY 2 - A fee such as this can be as high as 40% on a single item in your stores. THIS IS BEYOND A REASONABLE FEE.  3 - There is not a single fast food restaurant in Surprise that charges such fees. 4 - This was charged on my DEBIT CARD and not my credit card. Charging such fees is against the policy with my bank because of the lack of disclosure.  I am extremely disappointed that KFC would operate under such devious business practices as to shirk the public for fees that you are unable to manage by choosing another merchant services company or factoring it into your business pricing so that it is not an egregious attempt to charge fees as high as 40%.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.

As a follow-up to my original post: KFC sent me a letter from Mrs. Burnett, KFC's area coach, informing me of two things that have caused me to pause and wait for a response from them. I am doing this because they seem to be in direct violation of the law.  1 - She quotes Dodd Frank federal law 124.STAT.2073, 9b2. Here is her quote: "Stated in federal law ยง124.STAT.2073, 9b2 businesses are permitted to offer a immediate discount to customers as an incentive to encourage customers to pay by either credit card, cash, check, or gift card in order to automatically receive a discount which is applied at the time of sale. We offer no discount when paying with a debit card."  2 - "We would like to offer you a complete refund on your purchase and again sincerely apologize for the confusion, if you will fax a copy of your receipt to 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX we will make sure you are reimbursed at the above mailing address."  Apparently, Mrs. Burnett is no attorney and seems to have little to no experience reading federal law. Each section of this act ends with definitions to clarify what exactly what the law means when referring to language used in the act. In this case, the clarifying term is "DISCOUNT". Here is a direct quote from the act regarding discounts:  "(4) DISCOUNT.--The term 'discount'--  (A) means a reduction made from the price that customers are informed is the regular price; and  (B) does not include any means of increasing the price that customers are informed is the regular price" (ยง124.STAT.2073)  What KFC has implemented is actually in direct violation of what they are quoting in their response letter to my complaint with the Attorney General's office of AZ. They are blatantly increasing the price of an order from the regular price and not offering a discount.  Lastly, I have not received a refund as promised in the letter after faxing my receipt to the number she gave me twice.  I am simultaneously updating the attorney general's office. I can't stand aside in good conscience and allow for this company to rob the citizens of the state of Arizona.

I've been going here 3 times a week (doc's orders, post ACL reconstruction) for a little over 2 months now and I have never met a more knowledgeable and attentive staff. Their care and helpfulness, especially when I was about a week out of surgery, was more than expected. They listened to me carefully when describing any pain that I was feeling and took the time to educate me on why I was feeling the way I felt. The road to recovery is long for me and with the help of Clint and his staff of experts, I have no doubt that I will continue to improve towards complete recovery. Thanks to everyone at Foothills!

Let's start out with the disclaimer that I love great barbecue. I love a good smoke ring and charred bits of that taste in my mouth is heavenly. That being the case, I am also fairly critical of barbecue restaurants; especially when I have partaken in a feast of awesome barbecue at Rudy's original location off of Boerne Stage Road in San Antonio. This location in Chandler does not miss a beat.  We had the prime rib, moist brisket, and pork ribs. They all had that signature smokey taste and the meat was tender. The pork ribs didn't take much work to get the meat off the bone and the prime rib was on the rare side, just how I like it. Some people prefer to throw that signature sauce all over the place. I choose to poor it into one of their picnic boats and dip my meat in it.   For a side we had their great tasting cream corn. For those of you that scoff at creamed corn, this is not your subpar can of cream corn that you buy off the supermarket shelves. No, this was prepared well and the heavy cream concoction was sweet and, of course, creamy.   We left full and on our way out, we were informed by one of their cheerful and helpful servers that they serve breakfast tacos made to order and some more common variations in a grab-n-go bin. Looks we'll be trying that out tomorrow morning.   One thing that I do miss from the original store that was not carried over to this location is the smell of the smokers that soaks into your clothes and gives you a subtle reminder of the meal you enjoyed earlier that day.
