I really wish I was more hungry when I ate here.  The food is not the "traditional" Mexican food I am used to.  The margaritas are okay.  I don't think they are anything special.  I only tried the Lowrider Margarita.  The next time I am in town I will try the other ones.  My friend and I shared the Kuali de Camaron which consisted of roasted jalape√±o with cheese, chile, an avocado slice and shrimp.  The food was very flavorful, but not spicy.  I was expecting a little kick, but there wasn't any.  My friend had the Chiles en Nogada which contained a roasted poblano pepper with chicken, apple pear, dried apricots and and pecans, almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  On the side was chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies.  This is the chef's signature dish, and it was a very flavorful dish.  I took a couple bites and wished I had enough room in my stomach to have a plate of my own.  The waitress was very nice and checked on us several times.  I LOVE the Chicano art both inside the restaurant and outside.

I came here for lunch in the hopes of finding a healthier option than the usual food that is featured in Las Vegas.  I ordered the salmon.  Unfortunately, I felt the dish was very oily.  The dish had flavor, but it wasn't what I had in mind when I wanted to order a "healthy" meal.  I suppose it's my own fault for wanting healthy food in an environment that is anything but.  Would I come here again? Yes, the food is good.  I just need more realistic expectations.

Please come to Sacramento!!! Seriously, please come.  This restaurant would do especially well in midtown.  I will even help you find a good location.  Love the ambiance!! Great patio and service!!  My friend and I waited at the bar until a table was available.  The bartender immediately greeted us and was friendly.  I tried the honey cucumber lemonade. It was so good and refreshing.  My friend and I decided to share some bruschetta.  We chose the brie and apples with fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, salmon with pesto, and prosciutto with figs.   A-MAZING!!!  All of the ingredients were fresh and very tasty.  I don't think I have ever had anything like it before.  Once we got a table my friend and I decided to proceed to dessert.  We tried the salted carmel sundae.  It was a perfect combination of sweet and salty.  The only down side of Postino is the parking.  It's terrible, but thankfully there is free valet available.

I came here twice for breakfast.  The first morning I had the Tartine and the following morning I had the Sweet Crepe which is basically the Tartine, but in crepe form.  Both meals were very good.  The portion size was not very large, but for around $7, I'm not complaining. Both mornings I had a cafe latte.  Their coffee is excellent.  It's very smooth. I would have to admit with another yelp review that it is better than Starbucks by far.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They answered all of my questions and gave me recommendations from the menu.  When I am in town again, I will definitely come back.

I was in Vegas a few weeks ago and I was super stoked to have dinner here.  I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsey and I wanted to see if his food was really as good as it looked.  Let me tell you right now, it is!!! I opted for the Hell's Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu with the wine pairing, because I wanted to try as much as I possibly could.  I pretty much starved myself the entire day so I could accomplish this goal and it was definitely worth it.  This was the menu: Amuse Bouche- Scotch Egg paired with Gaston Chiquet, Chamagne First Course- Baby Beet Salad paired with Molitor, Riesling Second Course- Scallop Risotto paired with Lioco, Chardonnay (I added on truffle shavings) Third Course- Roasted Beef Wellington paired with Emilio Moro, Ribera del Duero Dessert Course- Sticky Toffee Pudding paired with Sierra Blanca, Bone Chiller, Brown Ale  I normally don't like beets, but the other ingredients within the salad definitely made me take back my opinion of beets.  The food and wine pairings was sheer perfection.  I took my time while I ate, because I wanted to savor every bite.    The service was excellent and I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant.  As other Yelp reviewers have stated, on the ceiling of the restaurant is a replica of Ramsey's hand motions when he makes his signature dish, the beef wellington.  It's a bit corny, but it's his restaurant and he can do whatever he wants.  Plus the beef wellington is phenomenal so rock on Gordon Ramsy, rock on!

I came here on 9/22  for the Oddball Comedy Festival.  My friend and I felt duped!  Our tickets said 5:00pm. So we thought that was the start time of the show.  I'm not sure if it's Tickmasters fault or Ak-Chin Pavilion, but boy were we mislead. The show didn't start until 7:00pm.  So for two hours we had to kill time with medicore-at-best food with ridiculously expensive drinks( $4.50 for water and $13 for 20oz beer). Thankfully they didn't charge for parking, but I would rather pay for parking and eat at a restaurant with better food than be forced to buy food/drink at the Ak-Chin Pavilion.  The sound was decent.  My friend and I sat fairly close in hard plastic chairs. With the show starting at 7 and not ending until 11, the chairs were definitely not comfortable by the end of the night.  Also, like another reviewer stated the huge overhead fans were nice at the beginning of the show, but as the evening progressed and the wind picked up I became very cold in my seat.  I don't plan on returning to a venue at the Ak-Chin Pavilion
