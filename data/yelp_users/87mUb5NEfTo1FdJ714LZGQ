The potstickers are very addictive.

With the new low prices comes cheaper ingredients. The flavor is NASTY! When I asked for my money back, they gave me attitude from someone named Parland

Disgusting food! Everything they served was either way over cooked or way under cooked.  Biscuits were old and stale and tasted like yesterday's batch. The Brisket was like shoe leather and tasted like they were leftovers that was microwaved.  When I filled out the comment card and told them of our experience, they just added my info to their mailing list for advertisements. I was never contacted about our experience.

I took my fiancée to Benihana for her birthday. The food was yummy and the chef was entertaining. We made reservations but made last minute changes and they were very accommodating. I would not dine there very often because of the prices, but I will be there for special occasions.

Amazing, I've been there several times. I usually get the #9 Pho w/ brisket & tenderloin and the egg rolls.  The broth is slow cooked daily. The herbs are fresh and the pho is delicious.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I live several miles away but it's worth the trip even though there are several pho restaurants along the way.  Plus there is a great bakery and market nearby to walk around after dinner. They also have delicious tea (hot or iced) which is a nice break from the usual soda pop.

Try the gazpacho. I never had it before and was reluctant to try cold soup; but I was not disappointed. Cold soup in the Arizona summer was perfect. I usually like to get the Greek salad.  The food is always fresh and tasty and the staff is very friendly.  I like to go there when I feel like eating healthy.

When we first moved to Maricopa we visited the limited choices of dining options in town. The first time at Great Wall was a major disappointment. Then we heard that they had new owners about a year ago; so we gave it another try. They since added a buffet and remodeled a bit.  What a great improvement! The buffet alone would rate 3 stars, but if you order from the menu and get fresh prepared entrées, the quality of the food is delicious.  The serving staff is very charming and attentive to customers.  BTW. If you are eating from the buffet and an item is running low or out, you can inform the staff and they will make another fresh batch.

Bland food with little or no flavor.  With the high prices, they can afford to use some herbs!  Great  for baby food!

I used to like Pepe's but last time I stopped in on "taco tuesday" for the $1 tacos, they filled the tacos half filling and you needed a magnifying glass to see the beef.  I didn't say anything, I just won't return.

Food was borderline satisfactory & service was horrible. I ordered a teriyaki bowl, miso soup & large drink. I asked if I could get my teriyaki 5-10 minutes after my soup so it won't get cold while I'm enjoying my soup course. I asked this because in past visits they would arrive at the same time.  They arrived at the same time again.   I also informed them that they were out of iced tea. They didn't seem to care. An hour later, still no tea. They made no effort to make tea. It takes 5 minutes to brew tea.

Worse Dairy Queen EVER. Priced Higher than most DQs and horrible customer service. They NEVER get your order right then argue with you if you try to sort it out. The ice cream and hard shell dip is watered down and way overpriced
