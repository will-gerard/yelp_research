I told my hubby we absolutely had to stop by welcome diner during our trek to Phoenix.   From downtown we took a short lightrail ride (because he doesn't like to walk recreationally) then ironically still had to walk for what appeared to be forever through the sketchy part of town -- no we didn't take the art district route.  The diner literally is a mobile kitchen. Bigger than a food truck, I mean enough to situate a counter, a line of barstools and the cooking area. The guys on board are super friendly, accommodating and truly love the contribution they've made to the community.  Yes this little kitchen serves cocktails and beer.  We ordered the acclaimed big Jim, two of them, hash browns and beignets.   Our big Jims were delicious. Extremely hearty with extra gravy. Unfortunately, however, without the gravy, the biscuit would be just thirst inducingly dry.  I suppose that would be one way to get you to drink more!    Again loved the gravy. They even gave me a ramikin of their mushroom gravy cause they felt I had to try it..also quite delicious.   The hash browns and beignets were alright but didn't contribute to this diner's stars.  We were impressed with our main entrees and by the guys who run this little miracle on wheels.

It was late, well, early for the vegas after-hours eating schedule, but definitely late for oldies like myself.  We walked in after a very short (thankfully) evening at a club, and I was famished.   The staff here is super friendly and accommodating. It was actually a surprising experience to have been treated so nicely at an asian resto. Usually, and maybe it's due to a common language barrier, the customer service is nominal at best.   Anywho their menu was impressive, with a large array of options for the picky tummy.  Pricing was great, with items ranging $6-$7. The portions are definitely meant for the hungry and soon to be hungover.    I ordered the pork broth/ pork/ udon noodles.  I really loved this dish. The broth was clean, and didn't leave a filmy grit in my mouth. The pork just as great.  Fair amount of garlic, green onions and cilantro (which I removed). Again, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and found it quite sad that I wouldn't easily be able to find a rival in my home town.   Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals as well. We ordered the eggrolls which were a bit girthy-er than I'd like but hey its fried and cruncy. Can't really go too wrong with that.   Satisfying meal that won't leave your wallet feeling raped. I'd definitely come back.

Polo Towers/ Diamond Resorts is an awesome place to stay that puts you practically on the strip minus the exhorbitant price tag that the larger hotels enforce on your wallet.  Great villas, spacious and modern enough furniture.   I would definitely return.

Love all the sephoras in vegas because they carry brands that most CA sephora's (with the exception of SouthCoast Plaza in Costa Mesa) carry: Guerlain, Becca, Illamasqua, Givenchy etc.  I'm such a beauty product junkie. During my last visit to Vegas, I made it to three different sephoras in the course of 2 hours. Love love love.   Their cosmetic return policy is also just as amazing, close to that of Nordstrom's.

I like MGM.   I stayed here recently and many times prior to that,  and loved how easily accessible everything was. By that I mean the outlets are intuitively placed to make charging devices easier!  The rooms are modern and I love the mirror in the restroom!  BTW, the VIP lounge is very cool.  If you can get on that, do it.  They offer snacks, and delicious coffee and computer/printer access.  It isn't as much of a labyrinth as other hotels and the rooms/towers are easy to find. There are a lot of eating options from cheap eats to fancy feasts.  The arena is also nearby which provides the utmost convenience.    Pool area is cool. Not the nicest, but it serves its purpose.    Overall, not a bad hotel to spend a few days in.

I have been interested in dining at Mon Ami Gabe for a very long time and found it a perfect opportunity on my hubby's day off.   The wait list for the patio is a very efficient process and doesn't take long at all. We came at 1030 am on a Sunday.  We were seated in a perfect little spot, staring out towards the Bellagio fountains. The sun was warm and the air was chilly. Just perfect. The service was just awesome. Our servers came to chat us up, and all our requests were tended to quickly.  I got a bacon, egg and cheese crepe. Needed more bacon but it had the most delectable cream sauce.  Hubby had a croissant breakfast sammy to which he added bacon. Now that was a huge, delicious sammy!! The bacon was thick cut and tasty. We also got a side of potatoes which were yummy as well.  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely return..

I  visit Vegs primarily for the eating extravaganzas and the buffset, but maybe in between, I just might throw in a visit to Craftsteak.  I mean hey If you've won a notable amount of dirty cash and you're looking for a worthy meal to splurge on, this is where you absolutely must go.   It is recommended that reservations are made, unless you like to spend a lot of time people watching in the casino.  The setup/ambiance is very contemporary, but not ostentatiously  trendy. The strategically dimmed lighting seems to bring out your dinner mates' best features, and possibly hides a bit of that post meal pouch you'll be harboring later on.   Started off with the mozzarella caprese salad. It seems simple enough but I think it was prepared very well, or it could have been the presentation. In any event,  this already got my mouth watering for my second course, the rib eye cooked bloody rare. Holllly! Bite after bite and I could barely contain my tummy fairies from playing their golden harps around me.  It was just that f@cking good. The hangar steak and filet mignon were just as good, but I fancy the slight buttery marble in my prime rib.  Got the mushroom risotto as a side and there I was, yet again, trying to contain my excitement over excellent meal. This was by far, the best risotto I have ever spooned into my greedy little mouth. Everything was so masterfully prepared, I can't even express that enough without sounding redundant.  I really wish I had room for dessert because my eyes ooogled as I saw goodies passing by me to and fro, but sadly, I was defeated! Sigh.   Either way, I was in awe over and over again as each food item crossed my lips....  Oh and service was stellar.   A typical 3 course meal will set you back about $90 with gratuity, oh it ain't cheap, but it's sooooooooooooooo worth it. I can't wait for the tummy fairies to sing their tunes to me again......

This was quite a disappointing experience for me.  We showed up an hour before closing, around 9:30P. Paid the exhorbitant per person fee only to find that they had run out of Prime rib, were not intending on replenishing, and tried to substitute that with flank steak. Sigh  I understand if we had shown up as the doors were about to close and the prime rib wasn't available, but cmon this is a pricey, supposedly upscale buffet where running scarce on prime rib should be a foreseen issue.   The rest of their food was ok at best, with none really catching my eye or compelling me to come back for seconds.  I will say that the best part of the buffet was their dessert section. Extensive selection for varying tastes. Awesome creme brulee and gelato.

The sight of the pink polka dotted brown box brings the giggles to my face and the grumble to my tummy.  On many occasions, friends that have gone to vegas have always brought me back an arsenal of yummies. They all know I'm a sucker for sweet treats. I eat 'em all, doesn't matter if I'm eating cupcakes thrice a day, and trust me, none of 'em go to waste. For my bday, the bestie brought me a box of assorteds, and I shit you not, I marveled at that 12-box and took photos of it like I  found a new lover and wanted to capture the moment forever..   And there was a time when I actually got to personally handpick my own poison. I've tried sooo many of their cupcakes, of course the red velvet, orange julius, lemonberry, kir royale, chocolate peanut butter cup, maple bacon, boston dream, oh my gosh ganache, banana cream bomb etc.  If I had to list my top 5 (in random order)..wow this is a difficult list to put together. I'm afraid the other cupcakes may be angry. I love the banana cream bomb, red velvet, lemonberry, ganache, and cherrylicious. Sad to say the bacon didn't make the list, and ya'll know how partial I am to bacon.  So glad there isn't a cupcakery too close to home. Just like a bf, absence makes the heart grow that much fonder (and the belly much less bigger)...

Let me preface this review by saying, I've been to both this hash house and the one at Imperial Palace and this by far is a shitton better in terms of wait time, service, and dare I say even the food.   I had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. All of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. Okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.  I was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. The original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the andy's sage fried chicken benedict and a chorizo hash. Mind you, two very gargantuan orders. What a good sport, I almost kind of felt bad. Almost.   Everyone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. We really enjoyed the sage fried chicken and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food.   Side note, the fried chicken in and of itself was a bit dry. Luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. LOL.   My friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. No one else bothered with drinks.   Bellies full, albeit painfully. Back on the road for a very long comatose drive home.

Recently stayed here and was impressed by the size of the room. We got a large room with two queen beds, and an huge bathroom.  The bathroom was huge enough to fit all of us girls at once without having to bump elbows.   Supposedly we got a handicap room.  Now that I think about it, and considering the company, that may have been just the case. LOL.  Room looked clean, and well put together. Interior was great. We even had a huge air mattress that converted into a couch. Two chairs, assembled into an ample size "bed".   Loved the large variety of stores, even rivaled the shops at ceasar's palace.   For those of you who are fans, earl of sandwich is here. So is the sugar factory.   What I appreciated even more is that there was much less foot traffic heading towards the room elevators. Typically the hotel room elevators are right in the casino. Much more secluded here.

Okay okay so my last few experiences at Earl definitely improved from that first visit.   This particular time, it was 6AM, and I was hungry for a bacon and egg sandwich. We were at MGM and it wasn't a far trek over to Planet Hollywood. I was practically in pajamas still, knowing that everyone else passing by us at this time, probably looked worse anyway cause they would have been coming home from a night of debauchery (and all that lovely things that come with that HAHA).   No line. YES! Got a bacon, egg and cheddar on ciabatta and a coffee.   Man that sammy was hot. Like steamy, burn your tongue hot! But It sure was good. The bacon was crunchy (ok slightly overcooked but it was still grrreeaat), fluffy egg, melty cheese, toasty ciabatta.   Now that's much more appealing to wake up to than that girl who looked hot under strobe lights the night before I'm sure.

Beautiful hotel right by the adjoining the Venetian.  3.5 stars.   There are varying food/resto options which makes gives it a good mark in my book.    We situated ourselves in a relatively grande suite. The main living area is spacious and is large enough to sleep a huge party of girls. The comfy couches serve as beds while the staff offers rollaways just in case your girls aren't intoxicated enough to knock out on the floor.   We even had a lil gym room that sported an elliptical machine. It served itself as a glorified towel rack.   At one point, we had three blowdryers going which in turn ended up shorting the circuits, rendering all our hair gadgets  useless. Sigh. Luckily, the other room which was attached to our suite had functioning outlets.   Anyway, the room deco struck me odd. I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but it didn't hold as much of a modern value as I would have liked. I did, however, really love the bathroom. It may have been the best part of the suite  Fyi, our first night, we were in the bella suite, which was smaller, but still boasted enough space to hold 9 people.   Our second/third night, we had moved to a two bed room suite.

While shopping in Montreal, watching my wallet bleed faster than it could clot, I figured I may as well indulge in some sinfully sweet treats.  My girlfriend, who is a montreal native, pointed me in the direction of the sweet factory (which we have here in the states, mind you).  In that same shop was a Monsieur Flelix & Mr Norton cookie counter (which we sadly don't have in the states). Encased in glass were cookies perfuming the immediate area with that freshly baked calorie-laden smell.   I had already decided to save room in my suitcase so I could shop for canada-only snacks and dammit I was going to make room for these cookies also.  I got three of each: menage a trois (milk, white and dark choc), macadamia & white choc, pralines & cream, milk chocolate chunk, vanilla white chocolate, amaretto, nutcracker sweet (almonds, pecans, hazelnuts and walnuts and dark chocolate).   They arrange the cookies in a very cute, and very giftable white box. One negative, is that they're a wee-bit pricey, but hey I was already bleeding cash anyway.  Obviously, my sampler didn't make it home untouched. I had my share of tastes here and there, and found my favorites to be the menage a trois, amaretto and the nutcracker sweet.  Great cookie combinations, bite-after-bite delicious, a bit heavy on the pockets, but overall, still a sweet deal.

I love the unique flavors that Ripples offers. You walk in here thinking you know exactly what you're going to have and your bombarded with the most delectable, tempting options that you begin to second, and third guess yourself.  So my recommendation is definitely step away from your norm, try something you've not yet had like chai, khulfi , 6x chocolat, cardamom etc. Or you can go with my rec, hazelnut, because it to-die-for creamilicious.....

I arrived at around 10am, and the airport was empty.  No crowds, no long bullshit at customs, and everything was fairly easy to find.  One thing I will comment, back in Detroit, I had to leave my carry on bag for planeside pickup (I never check anything in, I pack lightly), because the plane from Detroit to Montreal was super teeny so they store larger carry ons for planeside pickup or baggage valet is what they call it. Upon arrival, they bring your bag to you. No biggie, right..... lol anyway so as I was exiting the plane, had no idea where this planeside pick up was cause I so no bags being handed out so I kept walking with the crowd. A gazillion escalators later, a fellow passenger says they saw my purple carry on at bag valet unclaimed.  Soooo...I walked practically all the way back and ran into one of the employees, who actually put my bag onto the baggage carousel for me. He was nice enough to direct me through customs, walked me through all the way, and even got us a lift on on airport buggy and finally reunited me with my purple carry on. All the while telling me about his children, and what to do while in Montreal.  I really appreciate that he took the time to escort me through what could have been a very frustratingly ridiculous process...  So for now, definitely a fan of YUL.

This spot is the epitome of awesome local, mom and pop, hole in the wall burger joint.  I'm actually appalled there aren't more reviews for this little gem.   Their menu isn't large, but it has all the standard items, plus some notable extras, that any burger establishment should have.  I ordered the number 3, a cheeseburger with poutine and a cott black cherry soda.  Their burgers are no larger than an in and out burger, simple and unpretentious. The tomatoes and lettuce are fresh, and the meat is a deliciously odd, solid but kinda crumbly consistency. That aside was an absolutely yummy burger.   They've also got some really good poutine. I may not be a poutine connoisseur  but believe me when I tell you that prior to that day I had so many kinds of poutine, I can almost label myself an educated and practiced, albeit short-spanned poutine expert. They made me some right-on poutine with creamy gravy, lots of cheese curds, and fries done right.   Oh and their black cherry soda, perfect addition to that meal. Can't get it here in the states either, go figure right?   Also tried their Michigan dog, which is basically a beef dog with toasted white bread and topped with a hefty helping of meatsauce.   One thing I also noticed is that they separate your checks per person to ease with paying at the end.   Really loved this place. They've got a few locations but never derail from their un-franchised persona. No frills, no drama, just a great burger from a local spot.

It's 3:30am and after karaoke-ing, Lebanese food sounded like a perfect way to end the night.   Boustan's is a teeny eatery situated downstairs from a nightclub, a spot where all the drunkies go to post partying.   Oh but boustan's isn't just good for post-drunk meal, (i.e. dennys lol), their food is absolutely delicious.  The staff looks like they've been there for too long, but hey they're doing something right with their food.  Tried their potatoes had this yummy creamy garlic sauce atop. Also tried their chicken shwarma pita. The pita was toasted warm, crunchy on the outside, and soft inside. Their mix of veggies they throw in there definitely adds more life to that pita.   One thing I didn't fancy was that they went overboard with their garlic mayo sauce. Wayyy too much of that in there, but you'd hate to ask for an amended version because the main guy here reminds you of the soup nazi. Like, this ain't BK, it would almost be rude to have it your way. Nonetheless, all the food was good, and cheap.  Better than many of the LA spots that serve similar food, but certainly still not the best. Solid 4 stars here.

Au Pied De Cochon isn't for the faint or weak. Not for the faint of stomach (think duck fat and pork), faint of heart (think duck fat, pork and your arteries) nor the faint of wallet (think duck fat, pork and a  reputable name that costs money to even utter).  Call in your reservation weeks, even a month or so in advance. This is no walk-in spot.   Please do not bring your squeamish friends here as they will not enjoy the experience, and you may not either. Also, do eat lightly the day of because this meal will consume and overtake your body, and also that part of your brain that controls  food comas.   Our reservation was called in a couple of weeks in advance, and we got an 11pm block on a friday night.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  The restaurant itself isn't cabaret. No flashing lights or people in pig costumes. It blends with the surrounding establishments on its block, ninja-like if you aren't keeping a good look out. The ambiance is actually very casual, and upbeat.   Oh and their piggy icon is very symbolic of this spot, a little bit comical, a lot fatty.  We wanted to sample a lot of different things: two orders of the foie gras poutine, the infamous duck in a can, pied de cochon stuffed with foie gras, boudin maison, and côte de cochon heureux.  The foie gras poutine was heaven on a plate. With every bite, I could hear angels trumpeting behind me. I scooped up the last bit of it with our complimentary bread. Never knew I could fall in love with something so alien to me.   Duck in a can! Literally. It's quite a sight and very photo/vid worthy to catch them serving this up to you. Taste-wise, the amount of duck fat in there would make a roll of papertowels run away, but it ridiculously succulent.  Stuffed pied de cochon swims underneath a rich, glorious brown gravy, if you're lucky, you'll find some semi crispy skin under there. I know I did. Boudin maison was a delectable porky tenderness as well, probably the more conservative of the dishes.   Wasn't a fan the last dish on our list because there was just way too much blood sausage, which I have never been a fan of.   To cap this artery-clogging feast, and about 1:30 am,  we got brazilian coffee. Hot, creamy and liquor-y.  Unforgettable experience best saved for the brave.

An invigorating dining experience awaits you at Lavo.  Upon walking in, you're caught off guard by the perfectly dim lighting and their gorgeous set up. The hostesses were very warm and made you feel welcome. This place screams trendy but definitely not overbearing or pretentious.    We were seated at a roomy booth and were promptly offered drinks and our menus. Our server made it a point to be friendly enough to be likeable, but not overly talkative.   The first thing you'll notice is the crowd. No riff raff, just beautiful women and seemingly affluent men. Their menu simple but elegantly put together.   Their complimentary bread served with some sort of a tapenade was a great starter.  We ordered the oysters (well not for me), the kobe stuffed rice balls, and their white truffle fettuccine with truffle caviar  (which was that night's special).  The portions were about average for an upscale restaurant, so there were no surprises there (negative or otherwise).  The ladies had some red wine, which I think they enjoyed with our meal. The servings were sufficient for the three of us. You definitely don't walk away hungry. Everything was above average in taste, but one thing blew my mind: the chocolate bread pudding with vanilla gelato which we ordered for dessert. It was OMFG-heavenly.  Each bite was paired with a compliment. Yes it was that delicious.  Forget everything else, you just have to try this.   Overall, I think what made this experience a 5-star was how well the atmosphere, service, cuisine and of course the dessert just meshed incredibly together.  It's one of those things where each individual factor contribute to an even better outcome.   We'll be back for sure.

Yet another magnificent time at Lavo.  I brought the girls here for dinner for our bach party and had our meal set up as a pre fixe at reasonable fee per person which included tax and gratuity.   They sat us in the private dining room, and immediately they brought out delicious plate after delicious plate of varying items from calamari, to giant meatballs, to pasta, salmon, etc. Everyone was able to sample a variety of things and no one left hungry. They even had dessert prepared for us as well, deep fried oreos and a chocolate cake.   Great times to be had at Lavo. Make sure you add this to your list of vegas stops.

Med is a supper club located on St. Laurent amongst other lounges/nightclubs on a street teeming with nightlife.  We knew some of the staff here so I will say we might have gotten a little bit of that special treatment. At, the very least, our cups were always full, and we were checked on many occasions by more than one server.  The atmosphere is very retro-hip.  Red is their very obvious theme color, and fits well with their choice of furniture and general setup. Swanky is the word I'm probably looking for here.  The menu is primarily italian all within a moderate price range.  Ordered a variety of things here which were generally presented nicely and tasted great but nothing stood out in particular.   Drinks are less potent here, with a 1 shot ratio, vs what we're accustomed to in the states, usually being 1.5-2 shots a drink. I think as a whole, montreal serves their drinks in that manner.   The crowd is very euro, age range of around 30's and up with stragglers outside of that range. So far, everyone I met or came into contact with was fairly polite. Very different from the people you run into out of cali's nightlife. I honestly think hollywood holds more pretentious people than the ones I met in Montreal overall.  We did get two comp'd dessert platters that included everything on their dessert menu. All of that was good, and I realized, I ate a lot more of that than our french canadian companions. Or maybe I just eat a lot overall...ah well.   I didn't have any major issues about med, wouldn't mind going back.

Saturday morning after a long and enduring night of partying, they wanted some filipino breakfast.  It was around 11, and we assumed that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food since, well, vegas doesn't wake up until then anyway.  They had the lunch items out, absent any common breakfast items like fried eggs, garlic rice etc. They did have langonisa and tocino though.   We got a combo which had lechon kawali, (yeah for breakfast, I know) and langonisa, and regular rice. The portioning was small, and for a pricey fee of $8.00   The only aspect of the meal I thoroughly enjoyed was the langonisa (am I spelling this correctly), everything else was just ok.

Beautiful resto on St Laurent.  It lets off a sophisticated vibe, dimmed lights, classy atmosphere, high end italian food......  Down to the one important facet of this place though, the servers, both male and female, are double-head-turning gorgeous. That day, the ladies wore skintight hot pink dresses, ooh la la! The guys, while not in skittish ensembles, could still definitely pass as an inspiration for a billboard ad. But what is more noticeable is that the service is impeccable. They're all really accommodating, and never fail to flash those veneered smiles. One of the bartenders (yes, also in that hot pink dress), who made a drink suggestion to my friend, offered to doll it up twice when it wasn't to friend's liking.   I've been told that some hip hop big name chose to come here after a concert he did. I can't quite remember who, nor does that change my perspective of this place.

As aforementioned by other yelpers, Grand Lux is the cheesecake factory of vegas. The interior, ambiance, and menu options are almost symmetrical to that of CF's.   The menu is huge with options ranging from breakfast, lunch, dinner to the post party drunken stupor meal. Pricing is relatively reasonable and almost anyone can score themselves a filling plate, with leftovers even.  We came in for brunch, and I got your standard eggs, bacon and hashbrowns with toast platter. Huuuuuge portions. The bacon is thick, and cooked to a crisp. So were the hashbrowns. Three eggs done right and the toast which you forget about because your too busy stuffing your face with everything else.  The staff is friendly although you may have to wait a bit for service.   Do ask for a basket of bread to start. Absolutely delish. Warm, doughy with an extra slathering of butter.

Slightly pricey, but then again it isn't Walmart.  I love that they have a cosmetics counter that carries some prestige brands as well as skincare.   OH and they also offer cold deli sammies, salads AND at least 6 flavors of ICEE at any given time. WIN!

I love XS.   I'm not a fan of the indoor portion of the club. In fact, I'd probably avoid it in there altogether because it gets relatively stuffy and crowded.  But the outside.. the outside area is amazing. There's so much room to roam and frolic when the mood suits you, and what's even better is that there's tons of places to relax your feet without bouncers telling you that it's a bottle service only area.  They have so many tables that initially they ushered us to a daybed/ enclosed area right amidst the pool. After that area got sold, they gave us our own cabana. And their cabanas are impressively large. Granted, I'm sure that us being 25 girls was likely a large determining factor.   Even club-o-phobes can appreciate the less pretentious atmosphere that envelopes XS. Everyone's too busy having fun amongst their group to even prowl the crowd. We were able to  enjoy each other's company without having to swat douchebages away.   Outstanding design. I'm blown away with how well this club is put together.  Oh and TONS of beautiful girls. The guys are meh.

Spending a weekend in vegas with my friends and I had one goal -- check off as many places off my eat-list. Serendipity has been on that list for quite some time, and dammit I was going to make sure I got it this time.   Walked over the ceasar's and luckily the serendipity window's line wasn't too long yet. I focused primarily on the frozen hot chocolate (etc) menu and was quite taken aback by how pricey the menu was.   The menu was comprised of standard american fare with a hefty dessert list, but I was only interested in one thing. Frozen hot chocolate.  I reluctantly ordered my $14 , yes $14 dollar double size original frozen hot chocolate which I had intended to share with my friend anyway.   Wait time wasn't bad at all. After all, how long could it take to whip up a drink behind the express window.   My order came out, and I hand to two-hand it over to our table. The mofo was HUGE. I took a side by side comparison of the one person vs. the two person size.  In all honesty, the larger size could have been filling for more than two people.  I excitedly that first sip, and thought to myself, yeah, this is petty good, but damn $14. That could've been several steak and eggs plates. Sigh. It was a novel idea --frozen hot chocolate, but sadly it didn't quite live up to all the hype.  It wasn't quite frozen, and I was expecting a different, more unique texture. Ah well.   Doubt I'll be coming back here, at least not for their flagship menu item.

Frozen hot chocolate for $11. This better ignite fireworks on my palate and send me off in a frozen frothy chocolaty drink frenzy. Alas all this did was burn a hole in my seething pocket.   Overrated. Overpriced. Over it.

Mannish lady came up to us, gave us wristbands and ushered us into the Azure pool.   I'm so glad I was one of the few who went upstairs to decorate our friend's bachelorette suite while we left some of the girls to hang by the pool.  The waitresses are not sexy or even cute, and the patrons are even more blinding.   Whew, I'm enthralled I had to do bridesmaid duty that afternoon!

One of my girlfriends who moved to Vegas about a year ago wanted to take me out on a dinner date.   Rather than perusing through Yelp, I opted for her to call the shots on where to take me. Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.  She picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye.   Upon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar.   You don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.  We had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me.   BTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!  We ordered: Carpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeat  New York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just right  Truffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hit  Sweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.  Mind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.  We skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience.

Beautiful hotel with a slew of great eats and shops. Went to an invite only eats-capade here, where the top local restaurants shared their fare with all sorts of foodies (and non-so-foodies). Great set-up under the vegas lit sky.

Overpriced treats and drinks, nonetheless, not bad if you want that SUGARy experience. A lot of their sweets make great gifts to take home, if you had that kind of money of course. $25 blingy lollipop type of money. haha  OK OK I NEED they have white fudge, milk chocolate, dark chocolate clodhoppers -- a treat I could only get in Canada at one point. Coolness factor just went up like zingers!!!

During superbowl weekend, we spent much of our awake time at the Whatever USA event in downtown phoenix. This was a monster event which included free budlight branded booze and food trucks that were changed twice each day the event was being held.  After we literally just picked up an order from the brick and mortar short leash dogs location, stopping at our condo, and coming back onto the Whatever grounds, the short leash dogs truck was also there -offering up free food. Of course.  Well I sampled the crispy dog which was a jalapeno cheese filled dog, with some cheesy spicy sauce, wrapped in a crispy corn tortilla and fried up. It was delicious. My hubs who isn't typically a fan of jalapeno'd fare also expressed the same omg this is bomb face.

I was visiting my non-blood sister who resides in vegas and we had just come back from an afternoon of boarding in Utah.  Now I was hungry. Hungry and excited for the rest of our evening.  She's a great host by the way. We were trying to find somewhere interesting to grub and she suggested Max Brenner, I'm sure primarily due to the rave reviews about their chocolate infused desserts and dishes. Chocolate? Sign me up.   We walked through Ceasar's and made our way to the restaurant. It's a nice, classy yet casual establishment. We were promptly seated and the first thing I reached for was the dessert menu. Out of the four of us, I was the most excited to be lulled by chocolate.   We all individually got their frozen frappes. Oreo, two mochas, the chocolate truffle granita and hazelnut. The last two were mine. I couldn't choose so she said "get both", and after a slight twist in the arm, I acquiesced. The frappes came in cute porcelain glasses with alum straws, cool concept. I tried all the frappes and liked the truffle granita the most.  Onion rings with chocolate ranch sauce, waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder, crunchy mac and cheese are the apps we chose to start with.  The chocolate ranch was a bit odd, and didn't seem to pair too well with the onion rings. Waffle fries were good, even better  with plain ketchup and the mac cheese had a nice crust and bacon!  The boys got burgers which were impressively large, and per their opinion, pretty damn tasty. I gave up beef for lent (ugh i know) so I couldn't partake but they looked delish.  She and I shared the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato) which was nothing impressive but I ate my share anyway.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try more of their desserts AND a burger of my very own next time.

As always, I had to make a quick stop at Max Brenner's for a bite, mind you this was only 2 hours before dining at Wicked Spoon so I couldn't eat too much.  Met up with a girlfrend and at that time (530pm) it was still nice and empty inside. Ambiance is verging between casual and romantic and the chocolatey surroundings definitely encourages the appetite.  We got ourselves two White Russians (a MUST ), steak and cheese quesadilla, waffle fries and a choclate pizza. Did I say we were only having a quick bite??   Man those white russians are decadent. I would have been good skipping ALL the food and just sipping on those.   Quesadilla and fries were great, not too choco infused, or not at all, but nonetheless delicious ways to warm up the belly.   Wasn't much a fan of the chocolate pizza. The dough was hard, dry. Took a few bites and wished I had a second white russian instead.

Everytime I'm in Vegas, I always make it a point to stop at Max Brenners for one of their frothy, calorie-enriched shakes; however, this time, my resident-friend suggested I try Holsteins.  It isn't the same type of shake, but thought it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.  Yeah I know they have alcoholic shakes, but it was 2pm, and all I really wanted was a milkshake. The shake menu looked pretty interesting, but I gravitated towards the cereal bowl, primarily for my love of capn crunch cereal. She ordered the smores which was cool cause I'd get to try hers too.  Anyway, upon my first sip. WOW. I was blown away. That is one f@cking good shake, amongst the other complimentary profanities that erupted from my lips.   Damn Holsteins. Now I'm excited to try your burgers n things.

Another amazingly fatty dining experience at Holstein's. It was a no holds barred eating kinda night. Sat at the bar and had a cute and friendly server. She was suggestive, but definitely not pushy.  Stangely, the hostesses -- yes the first people you come across when you approach a restaurant -- were slightly haughty, slightly bitchy, or at the very least ignored me pretty well. And that rarely ever happens at any restaurant.  Anyway, got myself the Foie gras burger, sweet potato fries and a capn crunch (cereal bowl) shake.  Devoured everything. So rich and delicious, and I sure felt it afterwards!!

Impressive buffet, and I'm not generally a huge fan of vegas buffets because you pay top dollar, for essentially mediocre food.    Tons of choices, mostly standard buffet fare with some special concoctions throw into the mix. I ate rather well, and would definitely come back.   Of all the vegas buffets I've had, I thoroughly, and I meant thoroughly enjoyed the desserts here the most. Unfortunately, most of the time, desserts are just made to look pretty, lacking in real dessert POW. Well, I definitely got my sugar/fat fix in a very thumbs up way.

I generally like to try different restaurants, buffets moreso just to see what the hype is about, or if the table fare is equivalent to their pricey rates.   That all holds true, except when it comes to Vegas Buffets. I  love Wicked Spoon.  Although the menu selection isn't as vast as most, the quality of the dishes are unparalleled by most vegas buffets. You can definitely tell they took their time in dreaming up the week's menu. Presentation has also been well thought out.   Their Prime Rib was on point, juicy, bloody, slight salty crust, delicious. That alone was worth my $40. Oh and the desserts.  Good to the last teensy morsel. Gelato for days too.   I can't say enough how impressed I am with Wicked Spoon. I imagine, this will make itself a standard part of my TO EAT list whenever I visit vegas.

Jaleo is located at the cosmo where all the other restos are.   We had reservations and we were coming a tad bit late. I called in ahead of time just to let them know I was running around 5-10 minutes behind.  Upon arrival I apologized for being late. The hostess carried an arrogant attitude which unfortunately left a really bitter taste in my mouth.  We were seated about 20 minutes later at a table that had been unoccupied for about 15 minutes.   Luckily we had a really sweet server who offered food/drink suggestions. The restaurant is well lit with very modern furniture. The ambiance is trendy, just about fitting for its patrons.  Their menu is fairly large which I appreciated. We got: 1) Pan con tomate  2) Croquetas de jamon 3) Fried dates in bacon 4) Carne Asada 5) Chorizo wrapped in crispy potato 6) Pork and foie gras canelone with bechamel sauce  Everything was just ok. Definitely not worth the exorbitant prices for so-so cuisine  BUT. I will say that that the only redeeming factor about this meal was the pork and foie gras canelone.  It was sinfully rich, flavorful, and I just wish I had more.

I could just be partial because my bff is a cocktail waitress here, but I had a really rad vodka-filled time at Marquee.  I especially love their outdoor area where they have the pool, cabanas etc. because being in the open air sure beats the sardine-packed stuffiness of the boombox room downstairs.   I appreciate how they themed the rooms according to varying tastes in ambiance/ music.  BTW ATB was there that night, and I was stoked!!  Expensive everything, but had a beyond awesome first time.

I imagine this posh little coffee shop is buzzin with downtown phoenix's business folk every morning. What stood out to me was the artwork that adorned the walls and the scattered contemporary touches in its design.   I asked the staff to recommend me something that packed a punch but wasn't overly bitter.  She directed me to a miel which by the way, their medium size boasts 2 shots of espresso. I probably would not have ever ordered this drink before but I am so glad she recommended it. It's got the espresso shots, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon --such an interesting melding of flavors. Oh and I'm glad they had almond milk as an option too.  I absolutely enjoyed every sip of it.   I'm pretty damn sure I'll be back in the morning for another one. Or maybe even this afternoon.

On one of my many lone walks down the strip, I found myself inside Bellagio taking refuge from the 100+ degree weather.  I pulled out my phone and yelped for the nearest, most easily accessible treats and ended up st JP.    Wow all their goodies, from sammies to crepes to gelato to pastries-- everything looked so appetizing. Now I was already anticipating a large meal within the next hour so I couldn't go crazy.   I got the popular nutella brioche, vanilla eclair and peanut brittle.   I quite enjoyed the latter two treats but was disappointed in their nutella brioche. I suppose it would have been much better warm but it wasn't given to me that way. The brioche itself was tough and slightly stale unfortunately. At least they were more than generous with the nutella.   Pretty sure I'll be making a comeback. This time, with no other dining plans.

For years we had gone to Wicked Spoon cause quite frankly, we have never walked out disappointed.   Prior to my last trip to Vegas, I scoured Yelp for Vegas Must Eats and although my heart was set on another Wicked visit, the reviews for Baccahanal compelled me to switch it up.   As expected, the wait was long at about 6PM and the staff moved the line as efficiently as they could. For an extra $20, you can bypass the wait, but considering the buffet was already $50++ , we opted to starve just a little bit longer.  What I do like is that you check in, and they give you a time slot to return, and even shoot you a text, so that you arent in line for the 60+ minutes.  Once inside, we walked straight to the buffet lines and their selection was very impressive. All sorts of fou fou, rustic, traditional, new american type for as far as the eye can see and nose can smell.  On my first run, I had two plates heaping with food, and everything from the meat carving station of course.   To my disappointment, however, they didn't offer the infamous rib eye. I was moreso saddened by its unavailability since my friends and reviews had it built up so much in my head. Nonetheless, they offered tri tip, ribs, lamb and prime rib.   I had a little bit of everything, and although nothing stood out to me as stellar, everything I ate was pretty good.   Love their dessert station too. Their options are abundantly confusing although their ice cream didn't come close to Wicked's in texture. Weird I know. Overall though, I nearly tried every single item in that station and was impressed.  Definitely glad I stepped out of my Wicked comfort zone since we all left happy and painfully plump.

Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.  Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist.   So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers.   The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly.   The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.  We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious.   Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density.   Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me.

Hailing from a strict catholic background, I've seen my fair share of grande churches. I clearly had an expectation upon the drive to St. Joseph's Oratory.   Let me say that I was indeed impressed by what stood before me. It is a magnificent work of architecture only minds ahead of their time dream up.  There are many ins and outs, floors, rooms and grottos located within its majestic walls.  Masses, concerts and prayer celebrations are held here as well.  It also houses the tomb and heart (literally) of Brother Andre. In their candlelit quarters, you come upon the Stations of the Cross.   From the upper levels you can catch an awe inspiring view of Montreal. You realize this is a truly beautiful city sparked by so much history.  I could think of adjectives all day to expound on how magnificent the Oratory is, inside and outside of its great walls, but I think you catch my drift...

How do you eff up an orange julius--especially when  it's your signature drink. It was mother effing hot out and all I wanted was an orange julius. I even passed up 8 icee flavors because I said I'd opt for the orange julius instead.   $5.00 down the toilet. It just wasn't done right. Maybe the instruction booklet was missing that day.

My girl friend and I were passing through and stopped in for a quick drink while waiting for our hubbies to get out of work.  She had been craving a sangria but it wasn't on the menu.  She asked the bartender if he would make her one, and he said he would make one for her.  She was ecstatic. After he made it, he even asked her to try it first. We both agreed it was delicious.  I ordered a mule which was also quite tasty.   Very nice experience, even for  a quick minute.

We dined at Herbs & Rye and made it a point NOT to get dessert there. That's usually very out of the question, but on this particular occasion, an anticipated three course dessert was reason enough.  Three courses of dessert?! Yup.  I had only imagined the concept in my fondest of thoughts.  My girl friend had been here before and was excited to bring me. I think I was really way more excited than she was.   We came in and got lucky there was a spot for two at the bar open. The place itself, it's very clinical and contemporary with its stark white walls and decor. The ladies manning the fort were friendly and kept up with the diners' oohs and aahs. Oh and endless photo-taking.   We each opted for the three or maybe four course dessert which came with dessert wine. Even the menu was edible. I surely loved that little touch! Each course was meticulously prepared and artfully presented.   Now these aren't your fattening, carbloady desserts. Surprisingly each course was light, airy, but still satisfying that sweet tooth.  Each course was a curious surprise waiting to unravel.   We both had an amazing time and I can't wait for a similar concept to be brought to CA.

Short leash was on my list of places to eat while in Az though unfortunately due to our busy weekend, and my very long list of places to eat, we just couldn't find time.  Well the stars were in our favor because on our way back from grubbing at Welcome Diner and through the arts district, sure shit enough there it was, short leash dogs.  I mean I wasn't hungry but there's no sense in passing up the opportunity, you know?  We walked in and had a chat with the nice lady at the counter. I ordered the pretzel dog to go because we had the light rail to catch.  It came out nicely packaged with some fresh potato chips. While waiting for our train, I took a large (as if I were hungry) bite of my pretzel dog and wow it was a good bite. The pretzel was extra salty and the hotdog had a good crunch to it. I gave my hubs a bite then took over the remainder.  Ah funny thing, that evening, while we were at the Whatever USA/ Budlight event, short leash truck was there too (free food!) and I tried the crispy one with the jalapeno cheese beef dog. I'm glad it was available because that was the other dog option I considered while at short leash. Man oh man that was so freaking delicious. I got a few more and then a few more thereafter. Even the hubs really loved them too.  Happy we got to try short leash, though super sad we can't get it in CA. Since then, I've craved that crispy dog numerous days in a row!

I was meeting my fiance who had already been in Vegas for work. He was staying at the MGM which I was thankful for cause it's really not a bad hotel, but that's for another review.  As I entered our room, on the desk was a cutely packaged cupcake. It was a salted caramel with the mgm logo drawn on a piece of chocolate.    I excitedly opened the package and dug my fork from top to bottom. Then I ate each layer separately. The frosting was super sweet. If you had closed your eyes and tried it, you wouldn't be able to distinguish the caramel at all. It was just sugar. It was filled with actual caramel though. The cake itself was not too sweet but it was sadly super dry.    Overall, his gesture was super sweet and I thanked him in every way possible but I was left unimpressed.

It was the Saturday before Superbowl Sunday so the whole downtown area was chaotic. We decided to eat at this joint because the reviews were good and we were willing to wait a little bit for good sushi.   Well I walked in and mind you no one else was waiting. There were two empty tables which could seat two. And imagine that we were a party of two.  I approached the hostess who had a panicked and disinterested look beset her face and she basically said we can't seat you sorry. I asked her how long the wait was, she said an hour then again said I can't seat you. I pointed at an empty table and two empty barstools on the outskirts of the room. She said no those are reserved.   I get it. It's Superbowl weekend. But at least give me the courtesy of the option to wait for a table to open up.  It doesn't seem wise to turn down potentially good business --especially not one from the likes of me who would have ordered for 4 people and made them some money.  The scowl on the hostess's face and her demeanor-just unacceptable.

When our men are busy riggin', rigger-wives are out there boozin.   I accompanied my hubbs during the Whatever USA tour in Phoenix. He was, for the most part, working til the early evening. I met his colleague's wife and we instantly clicked.   During our first meet without the hubbies, we initially thought coffee, but said naaahhh let's go grab a few drinks instead.  We walked across the street to Twisted, conveniently of course, and sat ourselves at the bar.   I loved the very limited but compelling menu. I was really pushing for the ramen burger, but we had lunch two hours prior. Instead, we got the smashed potatoes, a peach signature drink and a mojito.   The peach drink --- wow it was so luxuriously delicious. And the smashed potatoes were crispy outside, fluffy inside atop other creamy yumminess.  We had an excellent time and the staff was attentive though not obtrusive.   This would be a great place for a girls night. It's the type of joint you'd find in hollywood or new york-- highly recommended.

My hubs had the pleasure of enjoying Cityscape residences for about three weeks for superbowl related work. We, I mean, he, was on the 22nd floor with a fantastic view of the downtown area. I was able to join him during his last week. Lucky me.   The location is in the heart of downtown with endless options for restaurants. It is in walking distance of some daytime grubbing and nighttime clubbing.   The residence itself, which shares space with hotel palomar, is quite impressive.   The staff at cityscape was awesome -very warm, friendly and accommodating despite the craziness surrounding superbowl weekend. My hubs even became friends with Travis (bldg mgr?) who personally took care of little issues here and there for him. I think they had become texting buddies.   They even made sure to hand my hubs all his amazon packages that were coming in.   The apartment was spacious and very nicely put together. The two rooms were comfortable and large, even with their own bathrooms and walk in closets. The windows were floor to ceiling so you definitely had a landscape view of all the events going on in the area. The kitchen was equipped with enough ware to prepare your own meals in case you wanted to spend the night in. It also came equipped with a new washer/dryer.    I was even more impressed by their pool deck area which had lots of cute couches, and a large TV. It also overlooked much of the goings on downstairs -at that time, it was the Whatever USA event by Budlight.  A fully functional gym with new equipment was also available for our daily use.   We had such a positive experience staying here that I didn't mind pushing back our Back to CA day.

My beautiful Canadian-ish homegirl and I were walking around the strip trying to find a place for brunch.   I suggested Tom's Urban because my hubby and I walked by it the night prior when we walked over to shake shack.  Tom's urban's location is great, right on the strip, patio, with lots of people watching from every corner.  We were seated in a nice spot where we were able to enjoy the music and watch the hungovers make their way around vegas.  At the time we went, around 1030a, the whole menu was available which made it difficult to choose a meal.  She's vegetarian though, so it does help with narrowing our options.  We decided to share the veggie omelet which came with toast and hashbrowns. And we also ordered the lemon blueberry poppyseed pancakes. Our dishes came fairly quickly and those plates were huge--definitely meant for sharing.  Our omelet was full of veggies and nicely cooked. I especially liked that it wasn't greasy like many omelets can be. The potatoes and toast were also awesome sides.    I think my friend and I would agree, however, that the star of that meal was the plate of pancakes. Those pancakes were light, very fluffy and very tasty even without the butter or syrup.  At some point, we were just picking at the pancakes!!   So good. so good.

That's a winning combo right there.  Hubby and I came in to have some fatty fast food, and aside from In N Out which we have access to at home, Shake Shack sounded like a great idea.   The restaurant is at a beautiful location, well kept inside and the staff is super nice.  We ordered burgers with bacon of course, crinkle fries, a shake for him and a sea salt caramel hot chocolate for me.   Though my burger was a wee bit greasier than I'd like, it was quite tasty and reminded me of something home made.  Fries were  very oreida crinkles which I love and that hot chocolate?! Wow, best seasalt caramel hot chocolate I have ever had. And surprisingly, I've had quite a few!

After circling the immediate area for somewhere to eat for what seemed to be hours, we settled on Tom Yum because it was decently packed which could have meant decent food but there were a couple tables open.  Mind you this was just earlier, the eve of Superbowl and the town has been in utter chaos with the 1 million Superbowl visitors that have come into the area.   It seemed one server was obviously frantic and trying to service a lot of the tables while the other 3 just coasted around with no sense of urgency.   Our orders were taken and you could tell the fellow was flustered but doing his best. The menu didn't include a few items that we had been accustomed to seeing on Thai menus. We settled on chicken fried rice, beef pad see ewe and a bowl of tom kah--we did have to make small modifications to our entrees.   What we noticed however is that the tables weren't being served in any real order. And it was our server who appeared to be responsible for most of the tables while the others kind of floated about.   Many tables waited for very unreasonably long periods of time.. so long that a few had gotten up to leave.   We waited. And waited. And waited. An hour plus and still no food.  We asked about our order to one of the floating girls and she said she would check on it. Another 15 minutes drifted and she came back with chicken pad see wew. "Sorry we ran out of beef so we made you chicken instead is that OK" well no it isn't okay. First off we should have been given the option, secondly it should have been decades ago when they knew there was no beef available. She said I'm sorry there's nothing I can do the kitchen ran out of beef.   Again we should have been notified of our options well in advance rather than them shoving us a plate of chicken..  I'm so disenchanted by our experience that I am still in shock.
