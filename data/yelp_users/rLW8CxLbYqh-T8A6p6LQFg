Pricey and boring. Everything tasted the same for crying out loud.

My fav pho place in town. So far everything i've tried there i've liked. The coffee and black bean dessert is a must :)

I loved the fries and the gyro wasn't as salty and greasy as other places I've had. I would definitely go during the day though. The place is kinda depressing....

The best part is definitely the bread. I brought my friends to try something different and we left happy. The location and menu may seem intimidating at first but everything we had tasted amazing.

Great environment and great food. The bread is to die for! A bit pricey but its enough for two servings usually. Try the pistachio ice cream. That alone will keep you coming back for more.

I'm Chinese and you must be able to "taste the wok" for it to be considered good. Its equivalent to tasting the grill on barbeque. This place does it right. And you get nice decor and pleasant service while you're at it.

Great buffet with just the right amount of selection for the stir fry section and finger foods. When I'm hungry all I want is a steaming plate of stir fry noodles and some of those crab puffs!

Their bruschetta is really good but I can't help but to feel that their menu is a bit underdeveloped. More choices please!

Their selection isn't great food wise but they have the best shephard's pie I've ever had. Their fish and chips and corned beef with cabbage are also favorites.

Good food with a good selection of hard to find stuff. The drink selection is amazing! Love their green tea milk. Would give it more stars if their  menu was more uniform. Its difficult enough finding a good place to sit without having to poor through their appetizer heavy menu trying to figure our how much food should be ordered.

Good pho if you like your soup base light and fragrant. If you're looking for something brothier and sweeter, look elsewhere. Also i've noticed that their noodles seem fresher than at other places. Might be because they're right next to an Asian grocery store...

Pricey sushi but its WORTH IT. Normally when I want a quick fix I hit up cheaper places but when I'm in the mood for great sushi with a friend, I go to Akaihana.

What an abomination! For soup noodles its pretty decent but please don't advertise it as ramen. Its more like instant ramen that you can get for 75 cents with tiny bits of meat that you end up paying 8 dollars for. If I can make it better at home then we have a problem...

I can't believe I even set foot into this place. Gave it chance and thought it would turn out to be a charming little place but it certainly wasn't. Filthy tables, filthy bar, filthy pool tables and not to mention the filthy guys blatantly staring at you from the bar. Did stay long enough to try the food. Do so if you're brave.

I normally hate Asian fusion restaurants since they tamper with too many flavors from too many countries and fail. But this place does all the fundamentals perfectly. Great flavors and enough heat. If you're looking for a good sit down Asian restaurant..which is difficult nowadays for some reason, then give George and Sons a try.
