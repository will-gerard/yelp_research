That's a wrap is the perfect lunch spot for health conscience people. But don't worry -- its not bland and borning. The food is tasty, the service is quick, its easy but also a nice, cute spot for conversation and relaxing mid-workday. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, but never takes too long to find a spot, so be patient. The salads and wraps are all great and suprisingly generous portions.

I really wanted to like Coronado Cafe. I'd heard great things and it's the type of place that is typically right up my alley, so I was very disappointed with my recent experience.   It's adorable - I'll give it that, but it was absolutely dead and such a buzz kill. We did a double date last Friday night and when we arrived at 8pm we were one of TWO tables in the entire restaurant. The wait staff was standing around with nothing to do and when the other table finished we were the ONLY table in the place so they started breaking down -- blowing out candles, picking up the tablecloths and literally turning lights off around us. They made it very uncomfortable and the antithesis of everything this charming, quaint, place should feel like.    The food was OK - two people in our group had the burger (decent - trying to hard with a weird mix of ingredients), pizza (undercooked, heavy and gross) and the meatloaf (the best of the bunch but still just okay). They were also very misleading with their sides and salads.   After being rushed out of the place so they could close down and get home we went to another local bar and realized we weren't offered the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour discount on our drinks or appetizers. Should we have to ask? It's printed on the menu and assumed it would be automatically applied to our bill - which was much too expensive for what we had.  Overall, a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience.

A perfect Sunday night consists of Streets of New York Hawaiian Pizza + My Couch + A Bottle of Red.   Now, I'm drooling and it's only Tuesday. There's something about their pizza that is perfect. The consistency, the thickness/thiness of the crust and the flavors of the ham and pineapple. I love it. Plus, their ranch and peppers for dipping and extra sin are the way to go.   Be sure to look in those cheesy coupon packets that come in the mail - Streets of NY typically has good coupons which help. They're a tad expensive but so worth it. I think the 18" Hawaiian (don't judge us) is $23.

All you with inner fat-kids... you MUST get the onion rings. They're like the size of donuts and SO good... so I've heard ;)   For a tiny local brewery this place is great. Warm, brewery vibe. I wish they'd do a little something more with the patio but overall no complaints. My husband is super picky about beers and really likes SunUp so I guess they're good. It's perfect for a bars-on-bikes stop when you're looking for something casual and good old fashioned fat kid bar food.

I sometimes forget how much I like The Rhythm Room. We went to another show last night - Griffin House - and instantly felt like we were part of VH1's Behind the Music. It's such an intimate venue, the acoustics are fantastic and it's set up just perfectly. You're a handshake away from the band, the bartenders are great, the drinks are cheap and the big patio is perfect for breaks and fresh air between sets. Take a chance on an artist you've never seen (tickets are typically cheap) and try out this Phoenix gem - totally a part of history. It's pretty fun to think about all the blues artists who've played throughout the years.

I recently raced into AlphaGraphics on Camelback looking to have invitations printed, cut and stuffed ASAP. Everyone working was super friendly and willing to bend over backwards to meet my time crunch without sacrificing quality or paying extra for rush service. I was thoroughly impressed.  I printed engagement party invitations and everyone has been so impressed by them.

DV Nail, may I help you? YES! You can - and always well. I've been going to DV Nails for years and they're great. I've "cheated" on them a few times when I hear of similar nail shops in the area offering specials and mini hot stone massages with a manicure but I always end up back at DV Nail.   Their massage chairs are wonderful - strong massagers. You actually feel like you're getting worked on. They're clean, friendly and always do a great job for the price. It's not fancy by any means and I wish they'd turn on the radio instead of the fuzzy TV but they're consistently good. They carry every Essie & OPI color and my manicures always last a long time. A manicure & pedicure is $28 total + tip. I think that's great.   I typically request Tina or Julie - they both take their time and do great. Don't be fooled by this place... there's often a long wait. I'd recommend an appointment.

Seriously, what's not to love about Trader Joes? I'm obsessed with so many of their store's products, the prices are CHEAP, the produce is fresh and I always end up with a gorgeous bouquet of flowers on my dining room table after a quick stop. The Trader Joe's pizza dough is wonderful, the wine is cheap and there's just enough stuff in the store to make anything you want but avoid getting overwhelmed.   Plus, who doesn't love being recognized and rewarded for using a reusable grocery bag? I just know one day they'll pull my ticket from the fish bowl! ;)

The owners of Delux should stick to burgers. I wish Zen32 was better -its one of the few sushi places in the Biltmore/Arcadia area, but its just not good. There's no other way to say it. We've gone multiple times always hoping to like it but its just not fresh or that good. Don't get me wrong - its not BAD, its just not GOOD. And, their happy hour is totally weak. So, if you're into just a basic California Roll and some saki - this is probably the place for you. But, if you enjoy Sushi don't waste your time.

This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true.   If you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why?   -Wonderful outside "first come first served" patio seating with fireplaces  -Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area  -A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious).  -No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking.  -Great service.  What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.  Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here.

We used PaperJoy for our wedding invitations and programs. Lydia, the owner, was a Joy (no pun intended) to work with. She was willing to stay late to accommodate my work schedule and was quick to respond to each email.   The best part about Lydia, was that she was very conscientious of my budget and helping me eliminate extraneous costs without losing the look I wanted. I came to Lydia with a vision of lace on my invitations and she was excited for a new challenge. Together, we created beautiful invitations and programs. Everyone commented on how custom and unique they were. PaperJoy's prices are beyond fair for the type of custom attention you'll receive. If you're not looking for a "cookie cutter" look definitely stop by PaperJoy. I can't wait to work with Lydia again for other paper needs.

For some reason I find it incredibly difficult to find a good sandwich in this town - its either Subway or a sit-down restaurant so I was thrilled when I found Sacks... a happy medium. It's perfect for a midweek sandwich with coworkers. Its a no-frills restaurant... don't go expecting to be wowed by the interior or "vibe" of the place, but rather a quick and tasty sandwich. My personal favorite is the Sack's Symphony with added honey mustard. My girlfriend always gets the Mona with salmon. Bonus - every order comes with a chocolate chip cookie.   Note - during the lunch hour it can get busy and loud. We like to order ahead and skip the line by hitting up the "to go" counter.

One of the best spots in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, great music, great food and reasonable prices. No need to be a wine snob to appreciate this place. Bruschetta is a must as is valet usually.

I'm on the constant hunt for good Chinese food in Phoenix. After many disappointing meals, I found Desert Jade and haven't looked back. The restaurant is super clean and quaint inside (even a big fireplace) and the service is great. Each of our servers have been super friendly and attentive. The food is really good. It's not going to blow you away, but it's fresh, portions are just right and I've never left unsatisfied.   I really like the Kung Pao Chicken, the Mu Shu Pork, Spicy Chicken with Vegetables (lots of them), and my husband loooves the glazed walnut shrimp.  If you're looking for an easy, casual Chinese meal in Phoenix - I promise you this is one of your best bets.

Dr. Bracken rules. In fact, one time my husband and I saw him in Costco and I got really excited and acted like I'd just seen a local celebrity. True story.   There's something about Dr. Bracken that just makes you feel like everything is going to be okay. Despite being incredibly busy he spends time with your dog/pet, will make after hours calls (trust us, we know) and is happy to call other experts when he doesn't know the answer (huge).    Our favorite thing about Dr. B is that he tends to be more on the holistic side of medicine. He advises against pumping your pets full of prescriptions and medicines that they may not need. Preventative is not always necessary and we appreciate that he doesn't try to "up sell" you on these things. In fact, he'll advise against what so many vets recommend. He's not going to tell you that your pet needs regular x-rays and teeth cleanings, etc. He really advises again unnecessary treatments - especially when they involve local anesthesia. We really appreciate his raw honesty about situations and he'll be the first to admit when he just doesn't know the answer. In fact, he was more than willing to work with a competing vet to solve a mystery case we were facing with our little one. This meant the world to us.   If you're looking for a fancy shamsy vet with websites, e-mail updates, couches and all the bells and whistles - this isn't for you. This is a place that's great because of it's wonderful staff (we love that most of their team can greet our pups by name) and Dr. Bracken's genuine love of animals.  The only thing that doesn't make Arcadia Animal Clinic a 5-Star is that you have to see specialists for certain things. Unlike bigger vet clinics, they don't have all the fancy machines, testing equipment and labs that other vets offer. It would be awesome to stay on-site for everything.

One of the best Thai Restaurants in Phoenix. Nothing fancy from the outside, but inside provides an authentic vibe, great service and amazing food at good prices. The new website (includes photos of dishes) helps with take-out ordering. The Pad Thai and #35 on the menu are a must.

Yum! You usually couldn't get my husband to touch spinach but the Mama's Original gets him his greens. We discovered Spinatos at the Culinary Festival years ago and have been going back since. We love the fact that its a family-owned business and that all the teenage kids work the place. The food portions are generous, the restaurant has a great Italian pizza place feel and they send you coupons for your birthday! Can't beat that.   I'd suggest for take-out or for a very casual meal out. Not a date night kind of place.

Hands down the BEST chips and salsa in Arizona. The flour chips and the salsa are soooooo good. Seriously - SO good. Its fresh and chunky and to die for it. Its almost worth going JUST for the chips and salsa and a margarita. I'm shocked that Aunt Chilads only has three stars - its one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley for many reasons.   If you want an ambiance that makes you feel like you're in Mexico - this is the spot for you. Sit outside and you're surrounded by a cute bar, plenty of seating, music and lush greenery that just makes you feel like you're in a Mexican Cantina. I think they even had bocce ball. The margaritas are great and the food is good too. No complaints here.

Spinatos is not your normal pizza - its heaven on a plate. You must get the Mama's Original Spinach... sooooo good. The sauce has a sweet flavor to it. Unlike any other pizza I've had. For sure filling.   The other thing my husband and I love about this place is that it's very obviously family run. The teenage kids work the front and act as servers - we love the vibe. I think its BYOB, too - bonus.   Unique pizza that's great to mix up the usual slice routine once in a while.

Like many people, we ended up at La Fonda thanks to an hour+ wait at Oreganos. It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance, but I have to admit that the food was fantastic. And if there's one thing my family knows about - it's Mexican Food.   I had a simple Bean & Cheese Burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. It was moist and filled with tons of beans and cheese and the enchilada sauce was great. My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple, mango and chicken and it was delicious as well. The chips and salsa were pretty good (I still prefer Aunt Chiladas) but the service was quick, the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty.   I don't live in the area and won't be driving out of my way to come back, but I'd recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some good Mexican.  Note: the combination entrees seemed a little pricey to me. We each got al-a-cart items which came with sour cream, lettuce & tomato and were plenty big.

My husband is always on the hunt for tasty Mexican food. You can find "fancy" Mexican food all day long in the Valley, but we've yet to find casual Mexican that's not served on a paper plate, and is really good. Well, we found it at Mi Patio.   The inside of the restaurant is much better than I expected - it's super cute, absolutely decked out in themed gear, has a vibe, a bar and makes you feel like you're in Mexico. What we really weren't expecting was AMAZING SERVICE. I mean, better than most places in the Valley. Our drinks were never half empty, we had everything we needed and it was quick (without making you feel stressed out or rushed). Then, to top it off, the food was great. We shared the green chili cheese crisp and the "Mi Patio Especial" shredded chicken burro with the white sauce and it was delicious without feeling toooo greasy.   We'll be back!

Do not expect to have a quick breakfast or lunch at the Orange Table. You just have to accept that they're slooooowwwww and the staff could care less. Deal with it. The vibe is great and the food is worth the wait. I always get the chicken salad sandwich and I love it. My only problem is:  a) they got rid of their honey mustard - i'm begging you to bring it back.  b) they don't serve lunch until after 2pm (maybe later) which can be a bummer when you're craving a sandwich.   Give it a try - one of the best sandwich spots in Scottsdale. Oh! And their patio is dog friendly.

Hands down the hippest coffee shop in Phoenix. With the recent expansion - it's HUGE now - there's tons of space to spread out, read the paper, work on your laptop, or simply enjoying amazing coffee, teas, cocktails and food with friends. I spend a lot of time here during the day and it's got everything right. Always great music, fast wi-fi, I love the $2 hibiscus iced tea, the pastries and now the drinks! It's a wonderful urban feel and such a breath of fresh air for the Valley.

This place is SO overrated. Everyone always raves about the authenticity of this restaurant and that its a Phoenix Gem - far from it. I'm okay with the orange vinyl seats and the 70s vibe - no problem, you don't have to be fancy to get my vote. This review is based only on the fact that the food is awful. My chips are always stale. The salsa is from a can and the food is always "okay" and I leave feeling gross and wondering "why did I eat that?"   I have no idea why this place gets so much credit.

Probably one of my favorite restaurants and bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix. Don't be alarmed by the fact that its in Scottsdale or the swanky appearance of the place... the prices do not reflect that at all! In fact, its almost "cheap" for the consistently good food you get, the cocktails - you MUST get the Summer Solstice martini - and the overall vibe. This is one of the places you'll go for dinner, but would be more than happy just staying at the entire night. The space is really modern with various art rotating and there's a DJ who spins up top in the loft.   If you're looking to experience Scottsdale in a classy, don't-break-the-bank way (and actually want to eat a full dinner, not mini "fancy" portions) AZ 88 is a must.

Looking for the perfect pizza for a lazy night in? Mamma Mia is where it's at. A tiny little storefront in a shopping center that reminds you of a traditional slice shot in a big city, you walk-in, grab your pizza and go. The pizza is AMAZING. Not too greasy and the price is just right. We're partial to the cheese, hawaiian and feta/onion/tomato combo. Plus, the slice & soda deal is perfect for a quick fix. We're pizza whores and this is hard to beat for fast, casual pizza to-go. It's been our go-to for years.   Be sure to scan the local coupon envelopes for deals or check online. Always $3-$5 off online orders.

I'm surprised Stingray only has 3 stars. Its some of the best sushi in town for the price. The best part about Stingray is their happy hour -- its UNBEATABLE. Unlike most places who end happy hour at 5 or 6pm, Stingray's Happy Hour is until 7pm and the speciality rolls are only $3-$5 (Dragon, etc.) with half priced drinks. You can eat a $100+  meal for $40.   Not on the happy hour menu, but a must have is the Morning Dew roll. Its like dessert.   The vibe is pretty good - can get a little too crowded. If the weather is nice, they have a great patio for people watching on Scottsdale Road.  Oh! And, Stingray is part of the Southwest Airlines Dining Rewards program - huge plus.

A couple coworkers introduced me to Mu Shu over a year ago and I was instantly hooked. As lover of Asian Food, this place is right up my alley. Its a quick and easy concept and you'll end up with lunch, dinner and lunch again the next day - there's THAT much food for less than $9. You pick your meats and spices and the rest is up to you to load up your bowl with veggies as much as you'd like. Don't be scared - load them in there!  They grill it all up and serve it hot over rice. Its delicious and generous. While you wait, you can help yourself to crunchy noodle chips dipped in sweet and sour (delicious) and a soda fountain. I love that you're not waiting on servers but you still get that sit-down lunch vibe. A must try.

I can't believe its taken me so long to write a review about Ticoz. Where to begin? It's all good.   Happy Hour - I love Ticoz for happy hour. The HH menu can't be beat - awesome drink and food specials. And not just snack food - like full on tacos and sliders. Great chips and salsa, etc.   Dinner Menu - So diverse and so good! Everything from burgers to tacos/enchiladas, Asian inspired dishes and salads. My favorite dish (and always a crowd favorite) is the Coconut Ginger Curry. Don't get scared - its not one of those "Mexican Sushi" types of places, its just got a great menu and everything is delicious. Oh! We recently discovered the nachos and CRAVE them now. They're seriously delicious and so fresh - even real jalapenos (not out of a jar). Yum. Yum. Yum.   Brunch Anyone? - They have HUGE brunch drinks and the prices are cheap! So great. The back patio is a nice little escape from reality when the weather is nice.   Service - We've never been anything but impressed with the service. The staff is so friendly. In fact, we recently went for happy hour but there wasn't a seat in the bar area and the clock was ticking... so a waiter came up to put in our order early to make sure we got the happy hour pricing - even if we sat after the HH times. How nice is that?!   The vibe is good for almost anything you can think of - a date night with your hubby, a group of friends, dinner with the parents or a happy hour with coworkers.

The best margarita pizza in town - and we know our pizza. The perfect flavor. Great restaurant with a simple menu and good atmosphere. Fantastic chicken wings, salads and margarita pizza. The sangria is pretty good too. Usually a bit of a wait, but worth it. Can do some browsing at the market next door during your wait and grab Gelatto after.

During the spring and fall in Phoenix, I'm a huge fan of Olive & Ivy. You can't beat their patio - its first come, first served on huge, comfortable furniture along with fire pits. The areas are nicely divided and its absolutely perfect for large groups. Sometimes the stench of the "waterfront" aka canal can creep up on you, but its usually fine.   What to order? I typically don't get dinner, but like to share small plates like the flatbread with my party. The sangria, margaritas and wine are all really good. Oh - and if they don't just automatially bring it over, but sure to ask for the bread and pesto. Delish!

A downtown staple, The Roosevelt is full of charm and is as comfortable as it gets. It's a historic home that's been renovated yet maintains its craftsman style charm. We love the front room with the fireplace during the winter, grabbing a couple seats at the friendly bar or heading to the back room for drinks with a group of friends. The menu is all small eats and perfectly compliments the look/feel of this place... its a menu that your mom or grandma would make when you came over... think deviled eggs, grilled cheese and tomato soup. The perfect place to grab a drink after work (I believe they have happy hour) or a nightcap after a downtown date. If you're looking for something a little under the radar, unique and the absolute opposite of anything in Scottsdale - head straight to The Roosevelt.

For some reason, I just REALLY like Pie Zanos. My husband typically gets the sandwiches (soooo good) or pizza but my favorite part is the salad bar. You can pick all your own toppings and make a deliciously fresh and generous salad. The Pie Zanos house dressing and house balsamic dressing is a delicious mix.  Cute and easy vibe for eating on the patio and people watching in Town & Country. Oh, and they're part of Southwest Airlines Dining Rewards program! Big plus.

We love the Esplande 14. In fact, we call it "our" theater and have a hard time going anywhere else. Its clean, great staff complete with tasty movie theater treats. And, its a great theater if you're looking to make a good old fashioned date night this is the place for you... great restaurant and bar options within walking distance to the theater. We often get Stingray for happy hour at the Biltmore and then walk over to the theater.

Pita Jungle is a great spot! Dress-up, dress-down, come straight from a workout... no need to worry at Pita Jungle. The servers are laid back and the vibe is always good. The food is fantastic. You can try something new every time and won't be disappointed - there's something for everyone. Don't be scared by the "healthy" look to this place. Some of the best things are the Blue Nachos and the Four Cheese Quesidilla - yum! Plus the Mediterranean Salad is to die for. Portions are big enough to share so get a couple things and branch out.

My girlfriend suggested this place for a midweek work lunch and it was perfect! The sandwiches are giant, delicious and the side options are great. My girlfriend got the "orange" flavored cookie for dessert and it was the perfect sweet treat! I ended up saving half of my sandwich for lunch the next day and it was just as tasty. It appears to be family-owned and operated, so the sandwiches take a little bit of time, but totally worth the wait!

Planning my friend's bachelorette party for 20 girls in Vegas over Labor Day Weekend was totally overwhelming and really discouraging as I was getting price quotes from clubs and pool parties that weekend. I was getting scared that we'd have a really hard time getting in anywhere without it being a huge buzz kill or spending a small fortune.   The small groups coordinator at The Cosmopolitan suggested I call Terrance aka Big T at Red Carpet VIP and I'll admit - I was totally skeptical. I figured it wouldn't be legit and end up just costing me more than planning everything myself - WRONG! I plan events for a living, and there's absolutely NO WAY I could have pulled off this bachelorette party without Big T and Red Carpet VIP.   From my first phone call he was professional, asked questions to figure out what type of group we were and was EXTREMELY patient answering ALL my questions and concerns (thanks, Terry!). He was totally honest about lines, clubs and costs without constantly trying to up-sell me on things my girls didn't need. For example, instead of pushing us girls to get a table at Marquee he pointed me in the direction or super pre-sale tix that were PERFECT.   BUT, the best part of Red Carpet VIP was how we got hooked up at Encore Beach Club - the hottest pool party on one of the hottest weekends of the year!   There was NO way we could have afforded to party the way with did if we hadn't have used Red Carpet VIP. A) We couldn't have afforded it and there's no way we could have got that many girls in for ONE daybed. Plus, just getting to walk right past the HUGE line was the anti-buzz kill!  After we booked our daybed I was still nervous - I knew we'd be okay at the pool party, but I figured we'd have just a decent daybed in the back. Well, I was wrong. Everything Big T told me they'd do - they did and did it above and way beyond.   The morning of the pool party we got a call from Kevin, our host, who met me and 20 girls in the cab line at Encore, walked us past the huge line, got us through security without any issues, and straight to our AMAZING daybed steps from the water and across from the DJ booth where Kaskad played! It was like a dream. I was thrilled and our bride-to-be felt like a QUEEN. Kevin made sure all the girls were pumped up, introduced me to our waitress and EVERYTHING was taken care of. I didn't need to hassle with payment, credit cards or anything - it was all done so I could actually relax and party! It was just like they'd told me, but I didn't believe it until I saw it.   20 girls walked away from that weekend saying it was the Best of Their Lives! I highly recommend you give Red Carpet VIP a call when you're planning your next trip to Vegas. It's worth EVERY penny.

I really, really, really like Switch. In fact, I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. My only wish is that the patio was a little more comfortable but the inside makes up for it. I prefer Switch for lunch over dinner but I guess it could be fun for a casual date night. The vibe is good, the music is great and its usually pretty full which gives it atmosphere points. Also a great place for a workday lunch with co-workers or clients.   They have amazing salads and sandwiches! Amazing. And they're huge you can totally share.   My Picks. Salads: Sangria Chicken, Spinach Feta, Everything Chopped (YUM)  Sandwiches: Very Berry Turkey, Sangria Chicken.   Appetizers: Hummus Plate   Drinks: Drunken Italian Soda - SO refreshing & tasty during the summer. Be careful - they're strong.

Imagine a white silk wedding dress.... black! Well, that may be a bit dramatic but it was pretty bad. More than 1.5 years after my wedding I took my dress in to Bell. They kept my dress for a couple weeks, called me when it was ready and I was so excited to see it almost new. They did a fantastic job and were careful not to over treat the lace and silk with chemicals. They made me feel like they really cared.   The business is family owned and the man at the front is so nice to work with. And, the pricing was extremely fair. I paid $89 which was much more reasonable than other places I checked.   I highly recommend Bell Cleaners.

Whatever you do... do not wear pants! You'll thank me later. This place is tiny and authentic and HOT. We went to a Miike Snow concert in June and the hot summer air felt like a gust of air conditioning when we walked out of the place.   Drinks are cheap and the space is great for watching a live show up and personal. Plan on having some cocktails before you go or hit up the beer-only tub in the back to avoid the crazy bar scene.   Oh, and ladies.. there's one stall. Deal.

Okay, so if you're looking for a real sports bar in Arcadia you've found it. It's totally a man's bar and one of those places you feel silly ordering a martini or glass of wine but that's what is great about it. You've got shuffle board and pool and TVs and a menu that will make any lover of fried food super happy. I mean, it even has one of those machines that you blow into to find out your blood alcohol level... need I say more?

My neighborhood grocery store and you can't beat it. It's recently renovated and it seriously HEAVEN for a grocery store. A Starbucks, fountain sodas, a bakery, make-your-own-peanut butter-station (seriously), Sushi Bar plus two of the best kept secrets in the Valley... the sandwich station, pizza bakery and salad bar station.   You can get a Build-Your-Own pizza and salad for $4.99. That's UNREAL. And it's GOOD. Both are made to order (typically by Ross or Ricky) and they're generous and tasty.  Same goes for the sandwich bar... lots of choices and fresh ingredients. I love (and crave) the California Dreamin' sandwich. Plus, buy 7 get the 8th free. All you have to do is swipe your Safeway card and it keeps track for you.   The Safeway "Eating Right" brand is our favorite.. wonderful pita chips and tons of discounted healthy options.  Love it!

This review is solely based on a mid-week work lunch. I would not go to Thai Hut for dinner (not much of a vibe), but if you work downtown and want to splurge on a quick Thai lunch - this is your spot. It's speedy fast. There's a nice list of lunch specials to choose from and you'll have your soup and spring roll the minute you sit down and a gigantic drink (so you're never waiting on refills). I've never walked away unhappy. The food is tasty and the price is right.

Gotta love, Yelp. I recently had a very strong Gyro craving and turned to the help of Yelp and the only thing I'm sad about is that I didn't try Z's Greek sooner. I'm. In. Love. Amazing Gyros, insanely sinful Greek Salads, Greek Fries... drive through or sit-in, you're getting the real deal at Z's. It's a family run business and the service is just as good as the food. You'll be sad when your Gyro is gone. Promise.

Perfect spot for a hangover... as long as you don't need food ASAP. A tiny restaurant (it used to be a Taco Bell), there is usually a hefty wait. The food is your typical greasy breakfast fare... pancakes, eggs and omlets but it's always good. Nothing great or 5-star worthy, but good. Big portions and some man-friendly creations such as the Wolf Pack which my husband loves. Not gonna lie, the Steak & Eggs looks pretty tasty.

Fantastic pizza for the price! One of our favorite take-out spots. Ask for the daily special as you can usually get wings, soda and pizza for the price of a large pizza. Great deals, great prices and quick service. Not a place to go sit and eat - strictly take-out.

I'm shocked by the solid 4-star rating on this place. We decided to try Maizies on $3 burger night - maybe that was our mistake. The line was long, the bar was packed, the bartender RUDE and the staff couldn't handle the crowd. The inexperienced staffers were all visibily flustered, bumping into guests and noticibly iritated by the people in their way (just waiting). We got a table near the door and that was awful - they should just move those tables all together. We were getting pushed over and over again and even asked to stand up to let other patrons squeeze into their seats.   Now, onto the decor... yikes. Its like they just moved all their leftover dorm room furniture into the place. Random wire racks holding menus and plastic containers everywhere and a few rugs hung on the wall - eh? Invest in some decor.   Oh, that's right.. the food. Yeah, standard burger they were clearly cranking out in the back (you can't make any modifications) and the rest of the items didn't compensate for the bland "I could have made this on my grill in the comfort of my own home" burger.   Take your $3 to Carl's Junior and get the $6 burger the way you like it.

The reviews are true. If you're looking for a fantastic dining experience in Arizona, NOCA is your place.   I have to say, I was a little surprised - in a good way - at the vibe. I was expecting something smaller and a little more stuffy. This is not at all the case! It was packed (on a Wednesday night) had great music playing and the lighting was just right. There's was a mix of people too which was nice - not the older demographic I was expecting. (I wish it wasn't next door to a Safeway or Great Clips, but once you're inside, you completely forget about that).   Besides the amazing food ... complete with cotton candy for dessert (how fun is that?) the service was FANTASTIC. Probably the best we've had in the Valley. Every person in there was working hard and it really made for a fabulous experience. We were treated to "tastes" of various menu items and even though we splurged, the bill was not bad at all. Totally fair for the food and experience.   I'd HIGHLY recommend the cocktail with a jalepeno in it - I'm going back to their bar (yes, they have a small bar inside too - who knew?) JUST for that drink. Yum.   Nice, work NOCA. My only wish is that we would have met years ago.

I've heard fantastic things about this place. That it is a cozy and the sandwiches and salads are perfect for a "ladies lunching" type of afternoon.   My girlfriend and I decided to give it a whirl today and I wish I could have my $23 back. Yes, $23 for lunch which was 1 salad, 1 sandwich and 2 diet cokes. RIP OFF.   We had the Hob Nob Cob salad which was GROSS. It was seriously a salad you could make better at home - spring lettuce, a tiny sliver of avocado and some turkey meat and sprinkle of bacon DRENCHED in ranch dressing. I really should have taken it back because the amount of dressing made it unedible. I could have rung-out my salad.  Then, we split the Vito sandwich (the Italian one) - again... it was falling apart and the lid on the balsamic jar must have fallen off as they were putting the dressing on our sandwich because it was SOGGY and DRIPPING. Zero presentation.   The only good thing about this place is the ambience.

For some reason it took me a long time to try The Mission.    Well, don't be like us - Go Now! The Mission is great and not at all what I expected (in a good way). By looking at the menu online I thought this was going to be a stuffy, overpriced, quiet, boring "Upscale Mexican" restaurant OR a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with great decor and awful food- wrong!   First of all, unlike so many places in the Valley, The Mission is a standalone building (aka you're not in a strip mall or shopping center. There's a quaint front patio with an over sized fireplace. Then, you walk inside to a dark, chandelier (lots of them) lit bar area and restaurant. The bar was packed, the music was turned up loud and the vibe was great. We were happy to wait for a table because we got to spend some time looking around inside and enjoying the bar. Unbeknownst to us, the restaurant didn't stop there. We were escorted to the adorable back patio covered with lights, a fountain and screened in by tall green trees. I give the vibe and decor two thumbs up.   So what about the food? So good! As recommended by everyone on Yelp, we did the table-side guacamole and it didn't disappoint. My husband and his dad ordered the pulled pork tacos that included 10 small tortillas on a salt brick to keep them warm - so cool - and all the fixings. They loved them. I had the fish tacos which was absolutely delicious. Don't be fooled by the small portions - the flavors are big and after chips, salsa and guacamole you're perfectly content.   This restaurant is a great spot for just about anything... a date night, girls night out, dinner with parents, out of town visitors, clients...  We'll absolutely be back.

Don't let the all white outside or the fact that its in the heart of Scottsdale scare you away. Its not as trendy as it looks. In fact, I was surprised by all the TVs and vibe inside - but not in a bad way - its more laid back than you'd think.   The food is really good. A tad more expensive than other Sushi restaurants in town, but you're paying for the location and the vibe. Would be a great place for a large group or special occassion. Have long tables and a side area to accomodate big groups and a bar in the back if there's a wait for table (I've never seen a wait). Its a rather large restaurant. Great location to walk for cocktails at AZ88 or the Mondrian following dinner.

Adorable spot for lunch! Its totally a "ladies lunching" kind of spot. It feels like a smaller version of Arcadia Farms. Great food and generous portions. Its tiny so expect to wait for a table but the service is low-key, the selections are great and the food is all super fresh.

If you're looking for shabby chic, rustic furniture and decor - look no further! I LOVE Rust & Roses and my house shows it. It can be hit or miss and pretty overwhelming, so I prefer going with a purpose, but usually don't leave empty handed. They have a huge variety of furniture and different washes and the price is right. I usually can't get over how reasonable the prices are. We've purchased a mantel, couple dressers, chair, table, etc. from here and have always been thrilled with our new treasures.   I agree - the owner isn't over the top friendly, but I prefer her non-agressive approach and lets you just walk and browse. Be sure to go out back and scout for outdoor finds - windows, doors, patio furniture, etc.   If you have more money to spend also check out Figs, Paris Envy and Melrose Vintage. All similar stuff, but Rust and Roses prices are the best.

You can't be R-Bar on a beautiful Arizona night (not the hot kind, the beautiful spring and fall kind).   The Camelback Inn recently modeled this place and Wow! Its absolutely gorgeous and everything you want. Lots of space, plenty of oversized furniture, fire pits, twinkle lights, water features and live music all against the background of the mountains. You'll pay for it with cocktails averaging $14, but its so worth it.   My husband and I (late 20s) love coming here for a nightcap after dinner. We just sit and listen to the live music and enjoy the beautiful Arizona nights. We love walking through the property and sitting in the secluded Adirondack chairs and enjoying our drinks. It doesn't get better than this on a nice night.  We were hesitant to try - thought it would be an older, stuffy crowd but its not at all. Its very laid back with the music of visitors/guests and locals.

If you don't have kids - stay away from the left side of the place - walk in the door and head to the right near the patio. Don't get me wrong, the leftside of the restaurant is fantastic if you're a family - big booths, Nintendo Wii set-up for the kids to play - just not where you want to be if you're not a mom.   I was thrilled when Arcadia Tavern opened. Its a great spot for happy hour and a true bar with real bar food - love that. They didn't try to get all swanky with the menu. Your basic fries, wings, nachos and even spagehtti and meatloaf options. Take a look at the photo of the nachos I posted - SO GOOD. My husband and I have shared this plate of nachos for dinner more than once (don't judge me). The beers coming in giant schooners, the prices are good and they have a guy who places great sing-a-long acoustic guitar on a regular basis. Overall, a thumbs up for a non-stuff, neighborhood bar and restaurant.   Oh, and did I mention goldfish racing on Thursdays?

The Clean Freak rules! So much so that my husband gave me a gift card to the Clean Freak for Christmas and I was really excited! We get the "Freaky Clean" level self-service car wash and you can't beat it. It's nice, clean, new and nobody is pestering you to upgrade or "get that crack in your windshield replaced" while you drive through.   It's easy.  It's fast.  You get a free amoral wipe for the inside of your car.  The vacuums have great suckers.  No pesky sales guys.   What more do you want from a car wash?   I love you Clean Freak.

I really do like Hula's for so many reasons... the patio is big and wonderful, the drinks are reasonably priced, the vibe is retro/vacation/fun and the food is delicious. I haven't had anything at Hula's that I didn't like. The Cajun Shrimp Caesar Salad is huge and delicious, all the fish tastes fresh, the tacos are filling and perfect. Yes. I tend to like Hula's most for an afternoon lunch on the patio or for a happy hour drink. Wouldn't be my first pick for a dinner date, but I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to spend the night there.

I think I fall in love with Hula's a little more each time I'm there! The first few times we just went for drinks and drinks turned into lunches, happy hours and now Hula's is a go-to spot for dinner. The vibe is laid back, but cute enough for a date night, the patio is spacious and wonderful for springtime cocktails on the patio and it's been the perfect place for casual business lunches on occasion. The service is always great which is soooo key, but the food is my favorite part. I've never had a single thing I didn't love and continue to try new things. My husband love mexican/american and I'm obsessed with anything asian influenced and this menu proves to be one that gets both of our mouths watering.   Favorites:  The spicy shrimp caesar salad is unreal delicious and huge  Island Style Poke appetizer - a must try. We're obsessed. The tacos are delicious I'm in love with the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl.  You can't go wrong.

A girlfriend and I (late 20s) decided to try Modern Steak for each other's holiday gifts in January. We snagged a great seat outside by the fireplace and didn't feel like we were in a mall parking lot at all - a major plus.   We decided to have a long dinner and ordered lots of sides off the menu (they're very big, so share) along with a main course and 2 martinis each. The service was great and our food was awesome. We didn't have high expectations, but left so excited about our experience. The inside bar was pretty packed with cougar-like women and older men, but it maybe an upbeat vibe if you don't mind that type of scene. Our bill was a total of $100 - and we felt like we didn't skip anything. It was more than fair.   Oh, and I wanted to move into the ladies room - its gorgeous! The whole restaurant is beautiful.

Shoot. I want to like the Grind - I really do. Its in my neighborhood and would be a great spot to add to my list of regulars. My husband and I went on a Friday night and quite frankly, The Grind just missed the mark. Here's my beef (pun intended) with The Grind:   Identity crisis - are you a sports bar (TVs with games), a swanky bar, a burger joint, a place for happy hour & music, or a garage (the uniforms are garage tech shirts)? It feels like they couldn't decide who they area and just threw it together.   Service - awful. Seriously, some of the worst service ever. Our waitress wasn't interested in serving us at all, servers were sitting around watching TV and it took 20 minutes to get a glass of wine.   Food - okay. I probably wouldn have cut the food some slack if the other things were better.   I'll give it ONE more try...

So, I gave it another try last week and I think it was worse than the first time. The service was better but the food --- if you're feeling low on sodium then head on over to The Grind. It's PURE SALT. My mouth was still salavating from the sodium overload hours later. Yuck. Plus, the burgers are these TOWERS... okay, so its impressive presentation for two minutes but then you try to eat them and its frankly just a pain in the arse. My advice - go to The Grind for wings, fries & beers at the bar but skip the burgers or any other food. Two burgers, fries, 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine = $65 salty meal that leaves you unsatisfied and craving Zin Burger or Delux.

My husband loves Sportsmans. Its probably the best little specialty beer and wine shop in Phoenix. The staff couldn't be more friendly - it absolutely adds to the experience. The bar is perfect for an easy post-work drink with co-workers or friends. Great selection of wine and beer (obviously) at reasonable prices. They also have some quick and easy food for snacking on. I think I liked it better pre-remodel. They could dim the lights a bit and add a better musical soundtrack during happy hour but overall a great neighborhood spot.

Recently went for a friend's birthday and we lucked out that it was a nice night, because we had the entire side patio of the restaurant, it was perfect.   The pizza, the salad and the drinks were all good and I thought the prices were totally reasonable. The inside is pretty tiny, which gives it a nice intimate "that's italiano" feel. The decor is good. I'd suggest this place for a casual dinner with friends or family. Not the place if you're looking for a "vibe" - not yet at least.

Not gonna lie - didn't hear good things about "the new Vig" and I think I know why... keep reading haters.   The Vig Uptown opened in the early spring and if you're from here, The Vig is synonymous with a great patio space. So, the feedback I was hearing was that "the new Vig is indoors" yuck. We want a patio.  Well, my friends. Welcome 112 degree days. I think the Vig Uptown is genius for Phoenix. The space absolutely feels very indoor/outdoor still allowing the nice breeze to come through, bocce ball for the boys and a very, open airy place for the daytime - BUT, you can close the windows once the heat wave hits and still enjoy yourself in an open, airy place. Mark my words, when the temperatures heat up and The Vig Arcadia is empty - the Vig Uptown won't be. And it will be filled with those haters looking to "feel like they're outside - but aren't." I promise you.   On top of the cool space, the menu is yummy and the drink specials on the weekends are great. You get 1/2 bottles of wine and the Vig Pinot Gris is delicious and at that prices.. its $12. Yum.   Note - the brunch menu is very limited compared to the full lunch menu, so if you go around 2pm, it's probably in your best interest to wait until the full lunch menu is available. We saw nachos come out about 15 minutes after we ordered and were super bummed nobody told us to wait.   Overall - perfect place to escape the "inside" this summer.

Last night a group of us went to The Duce in downtown Phoenix. It. Was. Fantastic. An old 1928 brick warehouse, the space is all indoor/outdoor, the food is roach coach style, the speciality "vintage cocktails" are served in mason jars and the overall vibe is uber hip & comfortable. We bought some vintage Love Button jewelery, ate Chicago style hot dogs, meatball sliders and waffles while mingling with a magician and singing along to 60's tunes. What more could you ask for? Oh, bottomless fresh squeezed grapefruit mimosas for a dog friendly Sunday brunch? Sign me up. One of the coolest spots in Phoenix for sure. The service was a little slow but that didn't bother me as everyone was super nice and quite frankly - I wasn't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting for a drink. Two thumbs up.

Although I'm not a fan of the name this concept is great - I'll give it to them... it's Fresh and it's Easy. You know when you've gone shopping, get home and realize you've forgeten butter athe thought of running back to the grocery store is just painful? Like, nothing sounds more awful. Well, I don't get that super annoyed feeling about going to Fresh & Easy... the parking is easy, the store is small, there aren't 87 butters to choose from each with a flashing tag, a "buy one get one" or "club card" purchase price - nope, simple and straightforward - two options - and then you get to check yourself out. I totally love Fresh & Easy when you don't need to do major shopping. Great to buy a couple meals at a time and the $2.99 wine is PERFECT for sangria.

If you love the wiener then you better try Short Leash Dogs! It's worth the wait.   I had the Moki and it was delicious! What a random but tasty combination of ingredients. Sometimes you just have to trust the experts and go with hteir suggestions - and that's what I did with this one. It was a little bit spicy and a super messy but very satisfying.   If you're looking for something different - the topping possibilities are endless.  The last star for me would be a bigger selection or beverages. Maybe they were just picked over but I'd love to see some sodas and bottled water available. I appreciate the cute factor or the cream soda, etc. but really love a cold soda and a hot dog.   I love that we're seeing these types of urban concepts in Phoenix.

Love That's a Wrap! It's the perfect local lunch spot. Quick, easy, healthy, fresh wraps, salads and yummy sides at the right price! I'm really sad they moved locations because its a bit of a trek from work now but I still make the drive. I love too many wraps to list but absolutely worth trying.

I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.   If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it.

A hidden gem in Phoenix. I easily give the bar 5-stars, but I've gotta go 4-stars overall. Don't get me wrong, the food and service is wonderful, but overall the restaurant is lacking just a tiny bit in the "awesome vibe" factor (if that makes sense). Great for a date night. My husband and I typically turn to Citizen Public House for drinks at the bar - either before dinner or for a nightcap before heading home.   The big, dark wood bar is stationed in the main attraction of the restaurant and feels very hip and mysterious all at the same time. Unlike so many bars (especially in Scottsdale), Citizen Public House prides itself on actual bar mixologists. I've seen some of the most elaborate cocktails being poured and served at this bar - it's so fun to watch and learn. The bartenders are wonderful, knowledgeable and nice to boot. You can't go wrong!

The rumors are true... its the ultimate ladies lunching kind of place. You can't go here on a weekend without seeing a baby shower, bridal shower or just a group of women gabbing and enjoying the uber-girly decor and garden setting.   The best part? The food is just as good as the vibe. If you're looking to get in with your future mother-in-law - take her here.

My husband and I snagged a great deal off Living Social and have been going back ever since. Both Tracy and Christine are wonderful. They're sweet and professional and the space is relaxing and inviting. My husband is incredibly picky when it comes to massage therapists and never really leaves a massage happy... until he met Christine. I think the words "best massage of my life" were used. No joke. And, they run an unbeatable and reasonably priced deal if you're willing to book a massage every month of so. Avoid the chain, support local and head down to The Art of Touch for a massage this weekend!

Save your money. I went in on a Sunday for a relaxing mani & pedi and no joke I think there was a hidden timer somewhere and the women doing my nails got a cash bonus if she completed each service under 10 minutes. The service was anything but relaxing, in fact, it was seriously aggressive. The water was scalding hot, the women doing my nails was so rushed and harsh it was painful. I feared she was going to file my toes off and then she used the cuticle nippers to clean out under my toes and fingers - OUCH! Are you joking me? I also didn't appreciate how everything was an added charge. When I said "no thanks" to the callous remover during my pedi, she seriously buffed my feet and heels for 1.5 seconds each to try and get me to purchase a heel buff. Then, when all I wanted to do was pay and get out of there, she went and started working on someone else (there were only 3 people in the salon - clue #1 this place is terrible) and after waiting long enough I finally had to ask her across the salon to check me out so I could leave. And then, she did it all while wearing her gloves from the other service and went right back to work. YUCK.   It was the worst manicure and pedicure experience I've ever had.

What a GEM! Sushi can be very hit or miss in Phoenix and Harumi Sushi wins for food, ambiance and amazing service with a smile! Not super trendy or fancy, but a great spot for a casual date. Upon entering, you're greeted with a big KONICHIWA from the owner and staff who bend over backwards to make sure every guest feels welcomed and has a positive experience. The signature forbidden rice is a fun twist on old classic. The sushi is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge! We always end up with more than we need because it's just too good to stop order. The H3 roll and Sushi Combo appetizers are favorites of ours. Give this downtown Phoenix spot a chance, you won't be disappointed.

OMG! I'm an avid spray tanner and have been all over the Valley and without a doubt, this was the BEST spray tan I've ever had. Alanna was amazing! Very professional and absolutely knows what she's doing. I seriously received at least 10 compliments on my tan, from both spray tan experts and haters. The color was a gorgeous golden, sun-kissed brown without any hint of orange. Plus, unlike all my past tans, Alanna's got the blending technique down -- I didn't have a single streak or blotch. Got my tan on a Wednesday afternoon and was tan for a solid week with mild exfoliating after day 4. As someone who battles skin cancer, Sungun is my new best friend and will be a part of my regular summertime routine! Highly recommend.

the sign screams MOD "SUPER FAST" which is a bummer and false advertising. Because it's anything but fast. In fact, it's very slow. And then, our breadsticks & pizza came out thin & cold. I'd be more forgiving, but the expectation was an in & out and then we sat around forever in line and then waiting for our pizza, and it wasn't worth the wait. The create your own & pile-on concept is great for different tastes in the family, but that's about it.
