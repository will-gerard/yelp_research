I took my car here to get service and was told I needed about three grand in service done. My mistake was trusting that this company was giving me a fair deal. After leaving my brain turned on and I called another shop and learned they would be able to complete all the same work for less than a thousand. Luckily, I only got one thing fixed but I will not be back.

I bought two packs of swisher sweet cigarillos and other items at this store. When I got and got them out of the bag they were open and missing a cigarillo each. I called back to the store and the woman that answered was really quite rude because at first I asked her just to make sure no other packs were like that. Then she began telling me that since I walked out of the store there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak with her manager then proceeded to hear talk trash to her coworkers about me over the phone line. It's really sad because I usually always go there but not anymore.

Do not be fooled this place has very little seafood it's a Chinese buffet. The crab legs that they offer you have to fight for and they taste old or have been boiled too long. I brought my kids here for a special dinner and was severely disappointed in the quality for the price. Never again.

I just got sushi here and I hate to say it but it was awful. I honestly just threw it out it made my stomach turn and if I spend $20 on two rolls it takes a lot for me to throw it out after one piece of each. It left a horrible taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of either. I'm not a sushi snob but I would definitely pass on this place.

The picture shown is not the actual cafe. They mostly only had sandwiches. I saw very few pastries that did not look fresh. The sandwich I had was not great for the $9 I paid for it and a small bag of chips. I definitely will not be back.

I love this place to get singles done. Liz is amazing and so much fun. Her mother Estelle is also great and will play Reggae for you and tell you what ever the song is saying if you don't understand ;-). I love getting my braids here. They always help me choose what color works together (I just had blue braided in) their prices a really good for the quality (which is excellent). Definitely check them out.

I had never been here fervor but me and my friend stopped here before the Dave Chappelle show. When we got there they said we would have to wait an hour but the patio was open. After sitting in  the wrong section Dan came and helped us. He made sure we got taken care and got our food in time to make the show. The hostess and all the other servers were incredibly nice and accommodating. I couldn't have been treated better. Thank you.

My friend took me here for my birthday yesterday. We both agreed on getting the meat and cheese plate. When it arrived you could see how old the cheese was and it had been left out. The bread was so old it turned to crumbs in my hand when I tried to tear a piece off in my hands because it was so old and dry. The manager was visibly upset at how old it looked. It was a big let down to the day. Needless to say we didn't get anything else.

This is the best vap place in the east valley Charles and his wife are awesome. You won't be disappointed here. Charles is full of helpful info and is willing to teach you if you if you are willing to listen. The shop is full of of cool toys and so many flavors some that are made just for this shop. You can try any of the flavors in the shop. I can't say enough about this place just come in.

I checked out this gym and it looked great and I signed up for classes not ever realizing they let you take a class for free. I took my first class which was hard but I did like it. Two days later I was in my Dr.'s office because of my back. My Dr. Informed me that I couldn't do any high impact activities anymore and to give them up. After three months of the chiropractor I finally went into the gym to cancel with a dr.'s note and Thomas tells me because I'm not fully disabled they won't cancel my contract until it's complete. I can continue to use the other parts of their gym. I only went to that gym for kickboxing. So I've paid $70 every month for a year for one class I paid all their sign up fees and for Two pairs of gloves and wraps just for one class.  Stay away from this gym. That have really unsavory business practices.

The old GM is back and called me today and apologized. He was so nice about the whole thing I felt bad for being so mad. He offered to give me time back on my contract since I was hurt and when I explained I couldn't per DR.'s orders he offered some time for one of my children to go in exchange which I declined. My son uses a martial arts closer to our home or I would have. All I know is he made every attempt to make this right and express his disappointment with how I treated.
