Save your money....Take your hunger elsewhere.  I ordered delivery from this location with a coworker at 12:50PM; the order didn't arrive until 2:10PM.  We ordered a hot pastrami sandwich, a cold cut sandwich and two orders of fries.  Let's start with the two orders of fries...Or if that is what you can call them. After accepting the abnormally small portions of fries we were given, we met face to face with cold, soggy and limp potato sticks. No flavor. Poor texture. Actually became thankful for the lack of portions so we didn't have to suffer any longer.  The pastrami meat was pretty decent, yet cold. The cheese wasn't what it should be..Cheesy. It was melted at one point but by the time the sandwich arrived the cheese was just a cold slab. They included a pickle...Should have been a nice addtion but it was severly wilted and warm as it was stored on top of what was once a hot sandwich.  As for the cold cut sammie, the bread was soft and delicous. But it defintely didn't meet the "#1" sandwich as listed on their website. 4 thin slices of meat were hidden in loads of lettuce, tomoatoes and an overwhelming amount of onions.  Order at your own risk.

I have ordered from Italian Spoon (Delivery) 10+ times. Never disappointed!  Cheeseburgers are AMAZING. Fried mushrooms are a flavor blast and always fresh and crispy. The cheese ravioli was extremely tasty as well.  Delivery service is always top notch. Arrives 15-20 minutes early than quoted EVERYTIME (Grubhub.com).  Love this place!

WIsh there was an option for ZERO stars.  First time I ordered from this place the food never came. When I called and asked where my delivery food was, the employee said they couldn't find my location...I work at a large luxury retailer at the Phoenix Biltmore... I included all information in the delivery details as well..Guess the driver couldn't read the ENORMOUS sign on my building. Anyway, got a refund.  I made the mistake of ordering from this place again. Shame on me. I attempted to order the brisket, but their "Staple" meat was out of stock. Food took a century to arrive. Once it did, I was heartbroken.  Portion sizes wouldn't feed the appetite of a 2 year old toddler. The "Smoked Sausage" was basically a sliced hot dog with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. The pulled chicken was..Definitely pulled...Pulled behind the delivery car and dragged through dirt. It was HORRIFICALLY DRY and flavor was non existent.   Oh, and if I wanted cheap boxed mac'n'cheese I would have purchased it from Walmart. I expect more from a so called "BBQ" resteraunt.  Save your time, money and appetite for a real meal somewhere else.
