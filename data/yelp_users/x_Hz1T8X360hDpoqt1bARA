Very upset with the service here. We showed up at 7PM to have a nice dinner before an 8PM show across the street. I'm still sitting here at 7:48PM and I do not have my food. We asked our sever to check on our order, was told it would be 5 more minutes and after 12 more minutes we still didn't have our food. Ended up canceling out order and paying for only our drinks. Stay away from this place!

I tried this place today for lunch and it was excellent! I tried a Carne Asada Burrito and the quality was outstanding. If you are looking for a quick place to get a taste of some Mexican food then this is the perfect place.

If you want Bruschetta, Pizza, and Sangria then this is definitely the place to go!

My girlfriend and I discovered this place months ago and we both fell in love with it immediately! The atmosphere is unique which is nice because it helps get you away from the every day franchise restaurant feel. The food is absolutely incredible and their choice of beer is exceptional as well. I highly recommend trying the Pilgrim, Cajun Chicken, and the Chicken Pot Pie. These three Pasty's are definitely my top three favorites. Both the quality of food and service easily makes this place one my of favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area.

I'm beyond impressed with the quality of food that Yoli's Cafe has to offer. My girlfriend and I were immediately greeted by all of the staff when we walked into the restaurant and we were able to pick our own seat. After looking through the lunch menu I chose the Monte Crisco and my girlfriend chose the Carne Asada Tacos. The Monte Crisco was perfect! The french toast bread was fresh and there was plenty of ham stacked on the sandwich. Without asking, I was given both regular syrup and there homemade Chipotle Marmalade on the side. The Marmalade was amazing and I will definitely tell them to put it directly on the sandwich next time. My girlfriend LOVED the Carne Asada Tacos. The ingredients were very fresh and they didn't hold back on the amount of meat in the tacos. On the side she got Mexican Cold Slaw and this amazing side of re-fried beans that had a hint of beef and cheese. After we finished our meal, one of the owners came out, sat down next to our table and asked us how we liked everything. He told us a little bit of the history behind the restaurant and the area that surrounded it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is tired of the franchise restaurants and who enjoys family/mom and pop joints.
