Now THIS is the way to see a baseball game.  You are sectioned high above the actual field, so you get a decent view of everything going on, your own waitress, food/drinks and REAL PLATES.  LOL.    Seriously though, for a special event or if you wanna have a decent TGIF meal while watching a game, it's a good time.  The prices are WAY inflated, as to be expected but again, totally a good time.

Ok, This place is expensive. Like $50 bucks for 1 kid 2 adults and that's just to walk in.  Plus the planetarium and any extras.    On the other hand, it was a full day worth of fun and exploration.  Totally worth it just make sure to bring the hand sanitizer.

Really cool set up theatre with a circular type seating, which makes it very easy to see the stage from any place in the theatre.  Loads of parking and really organized staff that makes getting in and out of the theatre easy to do.  Awesome place to see a show, never a bad time.

Awful has a new name.  Hillstone.  Just awful; service food...the whole thing.  Food was cold and poor quality.  Service, they just didn't care.  A tab of $187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope. I recommend taking your money elsewhere.

I went to this location on a marketing endeavor and was really blown away by the grandeur and refinement of the HQ.  Very clean and the people were super nice and very happy to greet me.  They had replicated a hotel and it seemed very much somewhere I would like to stay.  Great representation of the brand.

Don't usually go to Dillard's but it was my mom's birthday and she wanted some shoes...so...Dillard's we went.  Seriously, some of the best sales I have ever experienced in my life.  The place was super organized, everything labeled well and the employees were super helpful and nice and my mom is, well, a handful.    Super happy with the selection, sale, help and display.

I'm a regular Wednesday Sprout shopper and you just can't beat the prices and quality of stuff you get for the price anywhere (unless at an actual Farmer's Market but I don't wake up that early for anything). The shelves are always stocked and great selection for both regular and restricted diet options (I'm GF and the bf is not).   Parking is atrocious and its an accident waiting to happen.  The store is older and always under construction and the staff definitely sometimes seems a bit snippy with all the people pulling them in 100 different directions, but I would be too.  The parking and construction is really my biggest hang up as it just makes it very inconvenient when crowded.

Great theatre.  Cleaner than most.  $1 refill with loyalty cup.  Kids are nicer here than most of the other Harkins I've encountered.    Theatre is huge and parking is available since BWW no longer shares the parking lot.    Overall and enjoyable experience.

So before someone takes away my Phoenician card, I have never been here before.  A girlfriend has been going here for years, was dumbfounded that I had never been, so we bee lined it here. First of all, the owners are from my neck of the woods in PA so insta-love fest. Secondly, warm and welcoming they were so nice to go through the menu and give me samples of the food to help make my decision (which didn't cause everything is so damn good).  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich, TO DIE!!! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!! It was so damn good.    I love everything about the place. Next time, cheesesteak sandwiches; he's from Philly and they use real meat not the pre packaged stuff. I'm so stoked. Go here, spend the cash (cash only) support local businesses and fall in love. I did.

I love this place and the service!  No pressure sales really enhances the experience, whether you are engagement ring shopping or just browsing and everything in between.  I have been back many times to have some regular cleanings on my ring and the service is always top notch and really helpful even though I have no intention of buying when I go in, I always flirt with the idea since they are so nice and have such a great selection.

We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.    We were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.    We were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED.   The app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced.  The bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments.  I enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).    Overall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).  For a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it.

While no one is ever a fan of having to get blood drawn I have to say, this location and this experience, there is no better.  The front staff was nice and polite, even though the place was packed and we were a tad bit late for our appointment.  They took us back right away.  I had Jeannie, who is beyond BEYOND the nicest and most professional I have ever encountered.  I have to get my blood drawn from my hands as I have non existent arm veins and she was gentle and kind and did as I asked rather than try and fight me on it thinking she might know my body better than me.   If you have to go and get bloodwork done, this is the location.  Top notch all the way!

How can you not enjoy Oregano's?  The service at this location is always great and friendly staff.  The seating is about as ample as it gets for an Oregano's and the fact that they are ALWAYS busy, says something, they are popular cause they are good.  I got the Junior Beefstro Salad, the bf got the chicken lasagna.  Both are amazing ( I had to sneak a bite of his).    The portions are good size, and the price is right.    There is just no way to go wrong.

I'm a huge fan of their Wednesday prices and really enjoy the selection of good quality produce at farmer's market prices.  It's always a bit crowded and the parking lot is a disaster, which is why the 4 stars. Overall, people are super nice and friendly and the food is high quality/organic for really reasonable prices.

Went on a holiday skate, which is $10 for 2 hour public skate, including rental.  Not too shabby.  The rink is well maintained and large and the staff is really nice.  There are various choices in places to eat and drink and also a separate rink for hockey games and hockey garb as well.  Not too shabby for something fun and inexpensive to do.

I went here for the pop up boutique not for any of the services but based on how packed it was I may have to go back for the services.   The staff was really super nice and very helpful and attentive to me and the 8 other people standing in line, yes 8.  This place is a local fave it seems.  The boutique had some pretty great things at rock bottom prices, so I snatched them up especially compared to their higher ordinary prices.

I had a flat tire twice in one week (my kind of luck) on two different tires and went here and had the most top  notch service and the most helpful and accommodating staff at any discount tire I have ever been to.  I would recommend this location and the way this staff treats the customers to be the example of training for all other stores.  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes each time, no charge as I had the insurance and just really very happy.

Went here to have the 14 year old boy get his hair cut.  The price was fair at $14 and the girl was really nice and polite with him and did a great job.  I have heard horror stories in the past about this chain and was a bit skeptical but this just may be his new haircut location of choice.

The beverages area always good and refreshing. This is your typical Jamba Juice, nothing outside of that but that's not a bad thing.  The store is clean, the people are friendly and the drinks are good.  The drinks do seem to be getting more expensive but it's definitely worth it and the ingredients used are always tasty.   No complaints here.

I purchased a mailbox at this location and am very pleasantly surprised that I did.  I have purchased many a mailbox in my day and the service is always lacking and treat you like another number...but not here.  Rona is so nice and really takes the time to get to know you, always with a smile on her face.  She is kind to call and let you know about packages and is very accommodating.    The store itself if neat, with lots of nicknacks that can be purchased.    The only thing, it's tucked in the back of a Safeway parking lot, making it a bit hard to find and the parking is kind of a mess sharing with fellow shops and a Jiffy Lube.    Aside from that, this is a great place for your mailing needs.

Ok here goes: I love Chipotle, not his location.  There is always ALWAYS  line of epic proportions here, especially between 11:45 and 1:30.  The parking lot, which is shared with a CVS, Aj's and about 10 other places in close proximity makes the parking situation a mess.   The people who work there are suck-ish.  They try to be nice as they slop your food together, always annoyed and skimping on the portion sizes, especially the meat.  The food is the redeeming factor, which is why anyone goes to a Chipotle and endures the misery.

There is nothing really stand out about this place.  The service is crap, the food is overpriced and underflavored and its expensive for bar food.    I believe this place is frequented as it has prime real estate right on Northsight and you can see it from the road.  Aside from that there is nothing.  Go to one of the neighboring establishments and you will fair better.

Went in to check on the sizes of a storage unit and the lady was super helpful.  Really nice and accommodating and really tried to make it very convenient for me as far as location.  Explained all of the charges and benefits and even suggested their promotion that I was unaware of. Super easy and very happy to be working with them.

This place is top notch. The service is impeccable, the food is great and always fresh and the bread...mmmmm the bread, so good.  The best around.  The service is good, people are nice especially considering this place is a zoo 24/7.  There is always a smile on their face and always happy to accommodate, which is hard to come by nowadays.

Simple fast and good food.  Order, pay, eat and leave.  It's really kind of refreshing and then you get guality food in addition. It's kind of a no brainer. Affordable and good portion sizes as well.  The service is actually pretty nice too.

I went here because I heard via FB they had legit Cronuts...and boy do they.  I have never been here before but they were nice and totally willing to help me satisfy my curiosity for the elusive Cronut. I bought 4 (at $5 a piece) 2 in vanilla and 2 in lemon.  I prefer the lemon as did my bf who also tried them.  You could taste the high quality ingredients and I am very happy I found this place.  I will be ordering future cakes etc. from here.

This is no where near my house, but worth the drive.  The food is great  the service always a bit lackluster, though you will never go without.    The tortillas are TO DIE FOR.  Like nothing you have ever had.  You get a ton of food for the price and it is simply a no frills place.  You come here for the food plain and simple.  If you have never been, do it. at least once..but probably twice.

Had a deal chicken for this place and heard it was fabulous so I spent $49 on a deal chicken...I was really very very very disappointed with this place.  The service was awful, which should have been my first sign.  The food, especially one that is promoting a "tortilla factory" was bland and really nothing special.    The chips were cold, the chorizo queso was coagulated and our meal wasn't anything you couldn't get at a mexican restaurant for half the price and double the flavor.   The margaritas were watered down.    The best part, dessert.  The chocolate cake and the cheesecake are both pretty damn good, hence the 2 star.  Oh, and parking sucks too.

Went here on a Groupon type deal.  The deal was too good to be true and as is with most things in life, that is correct.  I rolled up to a very old looking and dated "salon". My nail tech was 30 minutes late. When she did arrive, she and the owner gave me a lesson in what I wanted done. Fine. Then, it took 4 hours to get done what normally would take 1.5 AND IT ONLY LASTED ONE WEEK!!! My nails literally started to lift and come off and when I text the pictures to said Nail Tech, she told me she was booked and couldn't fit me in. Do not go here! Waste of time and money.

I've been here many times, on girl's night on dates and each time it's the same, great wine list, great small plates with a wonderful assortment (such as olives and cranberries and cheese) which may not sound great together but with the perfect wine, it is in fact, quite good.  The service is always on point, especially considering how crowded it usually is.  On this particular night, there was a band, which I quite enjoyed however made it quite difficult to enjoy conversation and the company. Overall, a great experience but get there early as seating is limited and there will be a wait.

Here's the thing, I've been here a few times and generally love it.  This particular occasion was a serious disappointment.  I went here with a gf for my birthday, which also happens to be during restaurant week.  We made reservations, and it took 10 minutes of being walked around before we were even acknowledged. Once seated, we ordered our drinks, which took, no lie, 20 minutes to get to the table.  We should have taken it as a sign but the whole experience was kind of shit.  The server forgot to put in parts of our order, it also happened to be the part we were looking forward to the most. The food came out lukewarm at best.  I know Cowboy Ciao prides itself on better, I have personally experienced better but this time was truly suck.

Awesomesauce. No seriously, they have awesome sauce. The food is amazing.  I didn't give a 5 star review cause the Calamari was meh and as an Italian restaurant I expect good calamari.  Other than that, the service was top notch, the food was amazing and in large portions and overall great, old school mom and pop Italian restaurant.   I got the 4 cheese Rigatoni with grilled chicken and the bf got The Chicken Parm and it was superb. Pasta done al dente just right and the grated Parm at the table, you know its authentic Italian. Good stuff all around and priced right.

I only joined a friend at the pool, so my review is only on the pool.  What's not to like?  The view, spectacular. The service spectacular.  The people who attend the pool, wonderful.    Perfect way to spend time, getting some sun and inspiration and natural beauty.

Ordinarily really happy with this place and the service but this afternoon was a bit on the poor side for both food and service.    It was not crowded and we were seated right away, which was nice however our waiter came over about 5 or 6 minutes later to ask what we wanted to drink and eat.  We place our drink and app order and while we were telling him about our entree, he walked away.  I don't know if another patron got his attention or he was bored with us but just plain walked away.  He came back a few minutes later with our drinks and a cold appetizer.  We placed our entree order and our food was just...bad.  One order was undercooked, the other overcooked.  We tried to get his attention but he didn't come back from about 5 or 6 minutes again and we just figured "f this" ate and when he came back he just left the check and left again.  I have to say, I expect more and have always experienced better.  I would hate to think I have to take this place out of our rotation of places.

This place is heaven for an antique lover, just make sure you set aside enough time to go through it all.  You will find great pieces and items are amongst this whole place, with lots and lots of choices and options and the prices are really reasonable.  My gf found an amazing solid wood coffee table for $199 that would easily go for over 1k had she gone somewhere else.    It's a fun way to spend the day with a friend or loved one and just relive the past, too.

This was my second visit here.  The place is in a very deserted strip mall and was difficult to find the first time.  We made reservations each time, as was recommended by a friend as it is on the smaller, more intimate side.  Being that I am Italian, I am picky about my Italian food.  This place definitely hits the mark.  The portions are good sized. We ordered Calamari Fritti for the app, my bf got a chicken plate, which he enjoyed, I got a pasta dish, Pappardelle ai fiorni, which was very, very good.  The food is definitely fresh, made to order.  The staff is very nice and attentive without being overbearing.  The food is great.  The dessert, we got the Tiramisu, was outstanding.    All in all a great experience and enjoyed the intimate ambiance of the place.

I was looking for an organization that I could volunteer some time weekly and be apart of something that I was passionate about.   Project C.U.R.E fits the bill.  They provide medical supplies to communities and countries who do not have the means.    Right from the start when I set up my orientation meeting was I pleasantly surprised by the organization and amazingly nice and welcoming staff.    Orientation consisted of meeting the available staff, history on the origins of Project C.U.R.E as well as duties available.   Located in a big warehouse, you spend time sorting medical supplies or loading into containers or even driving to pick up these supplies.  The atmosphere is really nice and all staff is more than willing to help.  Not only is this a GREAT organization but also well staffed and represented. I look forward to my time with them for years to come.

Went for Sunday Brunch and  Bottomless Mimosas--Glad we made reservations as it was packed at open time.  This place is like eating in a friend's backyard, warm and cozy but smack in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Mill Ave.    The food was great, organic and fresh with an interesting take on the breakfast staples.  ...and the bottomless Mimosas are not half bad either ;)

Let me preface this review by saying I have only ever enjoyed Casey Moore's as a bar and have never had the food, though I hear it is good.  The bar is nice, right off of Mill Ave/University but a bit tucked away from the Mill crowd.  You will definitely get a unique people watching experience, as the crowd is diverse from college co-eds, to hipsters to punk...you get my point.  The alcohol selection is great, my fave being Ace Pear Cider, they also have Stella Artois, which I have found to be quite difficult to find on tap in other locations.  Added bonus, men get to use the "stone" outside restroom, where you pee, well on a stone outside. Kinda jealous considering there is always a wait for the 2 stall women's bathroom.  This place is always crowded, on this occasion I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed.  Service is always good and friendly, though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long.  It beats going up to the bar inside though, as that wait is usually just as long.  The parking is a mess, as the lot is small and well, it's always crowded.  Be wary of parking in nearby apartments, as your car will be towed.

Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.   I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now I'm starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food.  Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot.  Go somewhere else and skip Joe's Crabs.

Who doesn't love slot machines in an airport?  A good way to welcome you to Vegas, on the way out, they are your last ditch effort at slot machine millions.  The airport is great though.  It's large and well organized and TONS of options for food, reading and souveniers.  You can expect the regular inflated airport prices i.e. $5 for a BIC lighter however there is definitely service with a smile here.  I guess Vegas got the memo on how to be nice while taking people's money, which makes it a bit less painful.  I fly a lot and this airport is up there with the rest of them. :)

There are no words, NONE that can even explain the misery this place is but I will try.  The service, if you want to call it that is absolute CRAP.  Mia at the front desk is rude and should not deal with people.  Ian at the Concierge, if you want to call it that, doesn't care and couldn't help dry a wet rat.  People here are liars.  We were told they have internet, for free. Lies. When I called to complain, they told me to get over it and did not provide an alternate (AND I'M AN OWNER HERE).    They don't care about you once you have purchased, they only want the new $$$.    The location is also about a 20 minute or $25 cab ride to the trip.  They told us they had shuttle service, they  no longer do another thing they lied about.  They only have 1 restaurant on premises and its just bar food $10 for 6 chicken wings. No fries, no sides. nothing.  This place is the worst and I wish on everything holy I didn't own here.  Seriously, don't stay here. You are better off on the strip.

I LOVE me some Oregano's I just don't happen to share that same sentiment with this location.  Our server seemed bored and completely uninterested in helping us or being at work, which is fine but can you at least fake it and do I have to ask when its a good time to place my order, or to get refills, or to get a box or to order dessert or to get a to go cup? I mean, c'mon.    My review is simply on the service.  The food was good, as always. Never will go back to this location though, which is a shame.

This restaurant is really similar to its sister The Cheesecake Factory.  I really like how expansive the menu is and the portion sizes are always enough for a small village, which since I enjoy the food so much, makes for good leftovers.  I like that I can try something new each time, this time was the BBQ Asian Pork Tacos, which I highly recommend.    The service is really good, considering the size of this place is massive and its always packed.    The downsides are it's VERY loud and its hard to get great service since they are spread so thin.  Upside, they are open late and inside the Venetian which makes it convenient.

Where to start...I really really wanted to like this place.  It was our first time here and we like to try a new place on Date Night, so we went here, after hearing some pretty great things.    The host was nasty right away, which should have been the first sign.  We were seating downstairs for dinner, during happy hour when everyone was upstairs.  This was kind of nice, hearing the music and noise but having the restaurant to ourselves.    Our waitor was really great, very friendly and super helpful.  We ordered an app and I got the seafood platter off menu and the bf got a steak.    Instantly, we realized the food just wasn't prepared great or wasn't top quality.  The steak came out a bit cold, which was shocking.  We couldn't do dessert, I just can't have someone destroy that for me.  All in all we spent about $120 with tip and just wish we had not even bothered. Not a fan.

Spent a day of shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and thought I would pop in for some sushi.  Place was dead but the service was good.  The food is always high quality and fresh.  I sat at the Sushi bar and chatted with the Sushi chef, which was fun considering there was no one else in the joint.  I wish I would have waited a bit longer for the HH prices but over, its good food and good price.

I love this place.  Went on this occassion with a gf for hh and just the best experience (not there has ever been a bad one).  The hostess sat us on the patio promptly and we were immediately greeted by our server, who also happened to be VERY handsome.    We had the best service all night, very attentive and as good as it gets.   The food, as always, top notch.  Great portion sizes and quality.  We shared the mushroom ravioli, prawns and cheeseburger and all were to die for. I think my favorite were the prawns, great size and spicy amazingness.   Overall, doesn't get better and for the HH prices, it's icing on the cake.

I'm a regular at the location on Scottsdale/Shea and this was my first time at this location, honestly unaware it even existed.  I met a girlfriend here for lunch, right at 11 (opening time) and it was crowded within minutes.    Our waitress was supremely wonderful, with excellent service and really great demeanor.    Why not 5 stars?  The portions are half the portion size of every other Oregano's I've ever been to, and that's not okay.   Both my gf and I were a bit taken aback by the lack of food, which is a bit off putting.  Overall, great experience and great food.

Ok, I've been a HUGE fan of this place, up until this visit.  In fact, this visit will likely make me never walk into another Maggiano's ever.   The hostess did not great us, just took us back to a table. No hello. nothing.  Upon being seated, our "waitress" comes up to us and says "uhmmm, yah, I get it if you don't know what you want since you just sat down" and walks away. NOT KIDDING. It was all down hill from there.    The food was cold and just awful. Plain awful. No taste. The portion sizes are HUGE but I'm not trying to feed a village, just me.    I got the Ravioli.  How do you mess up Ravioli?  Go to Maggiano's.  Cold and slimy and the sauce tasted like a salt shaker fell into it.  Why didn't I complain at the restaurant?  I never had a chance to.  The waitress never came by to find out how our food was.  She never delivered the food either, just the runner.    Really bad experience and for the $60 bucks spent plus tip for 2 of us, we will be dining elsewhere.

Cheap, questionable chicken and really, really overpriced considering the quality and amount that is given.  Not a ton of options but the only thing open in town on Easter.  Spend your money elsewhere.

This location is always clean, the staff is always nice and there is always plenty of stock.  They have a nice variety of high/mid/lower end items with more options than most Targets.  The strip mall it is located in also is one of the better ones, with ample parking, other shopping/eating options and overall great location.   This is my go to target.  I just can't "check in" here as many times as I go, or people would be concerned about me. :)

The list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on.  The service is top notch, you will never be in need of anything.  The food, beyond outstanding. I LOVE the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad.  This salad will move you, it is unlike any other.  I took a friend there the other day, boasting about this salad, and he was impressed.  Yes, it's a man friendly salad as well.  The ingredients are fresh and crispy and let me tell you about the dessert.  We had the White Chocolate Brownie, which was beyond amazing.  The place is usually pretty packed, so it can be a bit loud but there is ample seating both inside and out.    Overall love the place, it is a bit pricey spent $60 on lunch for 2 people so heed that warning but aside from that, it's AMAZING.

This place is a gem!  This was my 3rd time here, first time for lunch.  The food and service was spectacular!!! The fish and chips, the best I've ever had, including some places in London!! The Blackened Chicken Sandwich on TOASTED chibatta, done perfectly.  They also have amazing happy hour specials from 4-7 and I recommend the crab cakes.  This place is all around perfect, I just wish I would have found it sooner.  They also do a recurring Tuesday night trivia night, which packs the place and is great entertainment.   Top notch all around!

I discovered this gem when I was there for the Yelp Summer Splash event and what a great place to have discovered.  The hotel is nice and clean and a LAZY RIVER.  Need I say more?  I'm in love.

I love this hotel.  The rooms are luxurious and spacious the restaurants are a plenty and the buffet is hands down the best buffet in town.  The shopping in the Forum shops is some of the best, from luxury like Prada and Gucci to affordable like H&M you cannot go wrong.  The place is just truly amazing and worth every dime to stay here.

Oh Butterfield's how glad I am to have found you after my tried and true breakfast joint just packed and left me.   The service is amazing, the food is super yummy and breakfast has never tasted better.  With so many choices and tons of space, there is never a long wait and the food is always high quality and top notch.  I'm pretty sure I'm in love.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  From the moment you sit down, the service is warm and friendly which is always a great start.    They also bring warm crispy on the outside, nice and doughy on the inside bread with salted butter. Yummo!!  The food is top notch quality and always fresh and great.  The prices are perfect too!  I just don't understand why there isn't one of these on every corner like their sub-par competitors?

Tina is the best of the best.  She is personal, has the experience (20 plus years) and will make whatever you want to be done come to life in your nails.  I have been all over and to a million nail salons and while this one is a good bit away from my home, I make the trip out of my way to see her and make sure I have the best work on my nails to not be destroyed.  This is a no frills location, though they did put in new chairs that are quite nice.  Go and see Tina. She's amazing.

LOVE this place.  The shopping and the food and the outdoors of it all make this place worth it.  The shops are upscale and well maintained and serviced and the staff is wonderful and I visit many of the stores on many different times/days weekend or weekday and it just doesn't get better.  The food is also top notch. Some Fox Concept restaurants like North and some chain like Cheesecake Factory or P.F. Changs there is a great variety in food and in price ranges as well.  Walk around, enjoy the scenery and shopping and it will be a wonderful day at Kierland.

First and last time here.  This place is in every strip mall on every corner so I thought I would give it a shot.   First, the prices are higher than most.  $25 for a "no frills" pedicure is a bit on the high end for a non spa location.  Second, the staff is not really friendly.  They do their job, don't offer magazines, water or a smile. They are strictly there to do a mediocre job on your pedicure and move on.  Third, you can only tip in CASH.  They make no mention of this until you are checking out and feel aweful that you have no cash on you.  Honestly, I have NEVER been to a nail place where you cannot add on tip.  My extra trip to the bank to go bring back a tip made this even less enjoyable.  Lastly, I get pedicures regularly.  I have NEVER had a pedicure chip and not the polish but my actual nail. Not awesome.  Save your money and headache and go somewhere else.  I've been to better and considering the competition, I'm sure you have too.

Just your neighborhood strip mall dry cleaner, I am a fan of the convenient location and the amazing coupons of 40% off that I can use regularly.  I think they might be a bit higher priced than other cleaners but their convenience is worth it for me and they haven't ruined any article of clothing yet, which kind of helps as other places never fail to do so.

A smaller and older location than your typical WFM but still great selection and people.  I would say the only thing is some of the quantities and selection is not as vast as the other locations, which kind of a bummer since this was is spitting distance from my house.  People are always super nice in the store.

I come here for the attached gas station after collecting my safeway rewards all month.  The gas station is a zoo but when you get .50 cents off per gallon, I suppose I"m not the only one trying to not pay ridiculous gas prices.

This is a no frills type of gym.  It has adequate equipment though not the most up to date.  The gym is hardly packed, so it's not usually an issue.  The benefits are that it is open 24/7 has an ample parking and most of the staff is nice.  They have a decent amount of class offerings and the promotion they are running is the best I've seen.    This gym definitely is targeted towards the older crowd or men who like their weights.    They have a conveniently located nutrition store next door as well as a protein bar inside of the gym (as well as kids area).  Overall for the price, if you are there for working out and not "working it" this place is great.

Let me preface this by stating my mother is FROM ITALY. Finally ordered from here after hearing countless good reviews about this place from multiple sources.  Ordered takeout on a Friday night as the wait was for over an hour.  I ordered the baked ziti, the bf ordered the lasagna. This place is legit.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely great food, quality ingrediants and made me really feel like I was eating in Italy.    The people are super nice and very polite, which is always nice.  The only downside is this place is packed all of the time and it is really very small.  The parking location is next to a Circle K, which always carries a very interesting aroma.  Aside from that this will be a repeat establishment.

As a woman, I just expect to be treated poorly and taken advantage of the second I step into a store that has anything to do with cars. NO MORE.   This Autozone is phenomenal.  I was experiencing slow starts and when I went to get an oil change, they told me I had a bad battery.  I did not believe them (upsell technique) so I went here.  They helped me immediately, checked my battery, which was in fact bad, he showed me the reading, didn't try to sell me a super expensive battery but one mid range and replaced it for me...and here is the best part IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES TOTAL.

I consider myself a sushi connoisseur and all around foodie.  This place was everything we hoped for and then some.  The vibe is ultra hip Vegas, inside of Caesars on the third floor of the Forum Shops.  We get there for our 9:30p reservations and promptly sat at a wonderful table with a view.  We wanted for nothing and the service was magnificant.    We had the Sparkling Blueberry Sake, amazing.  At $12 a shot we were a bit skeptical but it's so worth it.  We then ordered about 5 rolls in total but the two that stand out are, The Crab Dynamite, our FAVORITE and the baked lobster roll was a close second, just delectable.    There is nothing that I would have changed about this restaurant or experience and really glad it was recommended to us.

I consider myself a cupcake Connesiour  and have tried out Sprinkles on several occasions and each time leave feeling like I overpaid and have been disappointed by the cupcake.  While the actual cake part may be the most moist cake I have ever had the other things that comprise the actual "cup" part are lacking.  There is a lack of connection between the toppings and cake and the overall taste isn't that great.  It just always leave me wishing I went somewhere else and for $3.50 and up a cupcake, there are lots of choices that one should not be disappointed.  The parking is ATROCIOUS and the space inside is not for the claustrophobic.  There are usually about 15 people in the space of an elevator, salivating while waiting for the cupcake in a chaotic mess.

Why do people go here and spend money? This place is overpriced and the food is awful. Plain awful. On my visit, there was 2 people other than our party in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes to be seated and about 25 minutes to receive our food.  It was absurd.  The food came out lukewarm, at best. The food was bland and super salty and just...gross. I wouldn't ever go here again. just awful.

Loved it!  First timers here, we were looking for somewhere that is nice and not too high on the price range but just a great sushi spot and I have to say, Pure Sushi delivers.   The staff was great and really super nice and welcoming.  We never wanted for refills on our drinks and the prices were really affordable and the sushi, it was so YUMMY!    We had a couple regular rolls but also the Oktoberfest...TO DIE! This place delivers without a lot of the pomp and circumstance that is associated with many of the other sushi joints around and I can definitely see this being our new "go to".

I have been getting massages regularly my whole life. I could never commit to a monthly service as I never found that one person that would make it worth it...oh but all things have changed now.  I was delighted to a 90 minute relaxation massage by Brian that CHANGED MY LIFE.  I have never felt so good and relaxed and felt like ever dollar of my $60 was worth it.  He had the perfect amount of pressure and technique and I will be going to him as long as I can.   This review is simply on his services.  The girls in the front are lazy and kind of rude and can definitely use some customer service training or this would hands down get a 5 star.

Went to Rose and Crown after the AZ Science Center.  Heard great things about this place, so decided to check it out...wished I would have moved on.  Upon entering, this place is teeny tiny.  There were 3 of us and no place to sit but outside.  It's AZ, seriously, outside is not really an option.    We asked how the long the wait, the "hostess" said, "I dunno, til a table is clear" SERIOUSLY???? WTF...and then as we turn around to leave, she makes a snide comment under her breath.  Can't comment on the food just the "experience".  Too bad 'cause I was willing to wait.

I went here with a gf who RAVED about it.  I have to say, I didn't feel the same way.  It was really, really bland.  I didn't think Mexican food could ever be described in such a way, but such is the case.    The service was slow but it was lunch time and only one person working, so I will take that into accout.  The prices were fair to moderate for the lunch special.    The food, when finally served was lukewarm and just had no taste.

This is by far my fave B&N!! Open and spacious with a greater selection than most.  All one level, so you kind of feel encompassed by all the books, which I love.  Right in the middle of Tempe Marketplace it is also a great place for people watching.

GF and I went here for her bday, I drove from North Scottsdale to check it out.  I was super impressed by the décor and the different options and it made it super fun for my gf and her bday.  We got gel manis and regular pedis and they did a top quality job and then I got hit with the bill.  Lets just say at 2 bills for 2 people, I will not be a regular however it is great for a special occasion.  My gel mani lasted nearly a MONTH. No chips, no cracks, NOTHING.  For the price, the best goddamn gel mani I have ever received and if it weren't for regrowth would have looked amazing the whole month.  I just can't commit to somewhere so much more expensive but their quality is really top notch.  Just know you will be spending a pretty penny.

This place is as good as it gets!!! The food is AMAZING.  It's cooked to order, fresh and quality product.  I have eaten at a thousand different greek places and this one just hits the mark every time.  The prices are reasonable, the portion sizes are huge and the place is clean and friendly.    The location itself if small and at lunch time this place is packed so seating is a bit hard to find and it is easy to drive right by as it is in a strip mall surrounded by nothing that is in business any longer.  All of that aside, it's worth it.  I get either the Gyro special or a chicken salad, the chicken is really great. The bf always gets the chicken plate and it comes with so much food, and a salad and a side of pita and rice for like $9.  Do it, it's worth it.

One of the finest AJ's locations I have encountered.  The items are always well stocked, the service is always impeccable and the Grill is always well serviced.  The bakery happens to be my favorite, with a vast selection of exquisite desserts.  Never fails to impress.

I cannot explain how much I love the food here, especially the Fungi pizza. to.die.for. They have a great happy hour menu from 3-6 and all day Sunday, which I appreciate.  The service is hit and miss.  If only they could be more consistent with the service, this place would knock it out of the park.

The people here are miserable.  They are rude and don't give a shit about helping or being customer service oriented.  They act like you are bothersome.  If I wasn't stuck in this miserable contract I'd ditch these bastards and fast.

My car is brand new.  and black. I am obsessed with washing it and the service and quality here is really great and considering I won't take my car into one of those self cleaners, this place is it.  You can get a $5 express wash which is nice and they do a really great job and the guys are super nice. So is the inside staff.  For as crowded as it always is, I get done rather quickly and really am pleased with their service time and time again.

HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!! I found about this place last week when I made a wrong turn into the parking lot and was starving, so I decided to try it out.   I've been back 3 times since. This place is awesome.  It's fast, fresh, cooked to order .  To be fair, I have only had the blackened chicken tacos on corn tortillas each time, but they are THAT good.  the serving sizes are no joke either, so be prepared to share or be really full.    The horchata is pretty damn good too.    My fiance has tried the bean burrito, the blackened chicken burrito and the fajitas and all have gotten rave reviews from him and he's pretty picky about his mexican food.  The prices are moderate, which makes it an even better find.  The service is always top notch, eager to help.  Excellent food and great prices, what could be better?

Saturday night they all come out ot play.  This was my first time here and I was kind of enamored with the whole "old bank" deal.  The vibe and people are what make this joint worth it.  Oh and the $5 martinis. The service...oh the service.  You would get your food faster by going to the grocery store, going home cooking and brining it then you would relying on the service...oh and they are not especially friendly either.  The food was pretty good though, once served.

Met some friends here on a Friday night and waited over 2 hours to get a table. I have never EVER waited that long to get a table, anywhere but I am soooo glad we did.  The service was impeccable and the food was to die for.  So good and different than anything I have had in a long time.  The prices were great too, which just made this an amazing experience all around.  Totally would get 5 stars if I didn't have to wait 2 hours.

Sometimes the hype is worth listening to and Humble Pie lives up to the hype.  It is so friggin good I thought about joining a gym just so I can justify eating here, all the time.  I had the fig and prosciutto and goat cheese pie, the bf had the fungi pie. Awesome. The service was amazing, the portion sizes were really good (not too big) and the ingredients and taste and combinations of the food was impeccable. Seriously gonna be the go to spot.

I originally went to Breakfast Joynt when I moved to the neighborhood and I am always looking for a good breakfast place.    The place is on the smaller side for its location and it can get crowded.  I have had to wait 45 minutes to be seated on a weekday!    The selection is moderate, from your regular breakfast staples, like steak and eggs to the build your own omelet, which you can have as many toppings as you like at no additional charge, which is nice.    The Biscuits and Gravy and Chicken fried Chicken are amazing, some of the best I've ever had.    The portion size are moderate, which is nice to not be served enough food for a small village for one.   The service, while extremely nice, can be VERY slow.  This place is more leisurely when it comes to service so do not go here if you are in a time crunch.    The prices are good, especially with the Groupon promotions they run pretty regularly   and they have this "Belly" app that you "check in" and earn points towards a free meal which is also a bonus.   While there seems to be a plethora of breakfast establishments none that are locally owned, operated and serve the food made to order, which is a nice change at the Breakfast Joynt.    There is seating outside, which is nice and they also offer wi-fi, which is a bonus.    The decor is a bit odd, with Chicago skylines, Bears and Vikings and Packers paraphernalia about the place.  There is also one TV that only half of the restaurant can view as the other half has its back to it.

You are almost afraid to touch anything in here, everything looks untouched, including the condiments.  Samples, you have to get them from an employee...make a mess at the condiments, someone will clean up right away.  Crowded?  all the time. I have sampled each flavor, but their "award winning" oatmeal cookie is the way I go each time and for a reason, it's liquid oatmeal cookie.  Delightful.  If you can get past the OCD staff and the fact that its always packed, it's the best yogurt joint I've been to.

I've heard great things about this place for sometime, so finally decided to make some reservations and try it out.  We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed.  Standard Country Club/Steakhouse decor, very cowboy/wild west.  Casual attire is fine here, as we were WAY overdressed.  The host was a bit snippy but aside from the interaction with her, the rest of the evening was delighful.    The menu had a good selection.  For our app we got the seafood platter.  Oysters, lobster tail, crab legs, and jumbo prawn.  Everything was halved and nighly prepared with a selection of dipping sauces and lemon.  My bf got the 12oz NY Strip and I have never seen a man enjoy a steak as much as he did.  He usually enjoys a better cut of steak but craving something different and he was impressed.  He got the Blue cheese butter to go with it and raved about this steak for days.  I got the 6 oz filet medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The accompaniments were the cream of spinach and the twice baked potato and it was just amazing.  For desert we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb cobbler with basil gelato and it was delightful.    The service was outstanding and really helpful and we never went without.  Great experience.

My review is for the Happy Hour.  We were lucky enough to score a table as we got to Brio at exactly 4pm, had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck.  I'm usually skepticl when it comes to HH menus but this place is amazing.  The food was $3 or $4 bucks a plate and the drinks around $5 depending on what you got.   The selection was fantastic and even better was the service.  There was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus.  Our server was on top of it.  He was pleasant and friendly and really added to the experience.  The food was out-friggin-standing.  We got the pepperoni/sausage flatbread and it was defnitely a favorite amongst everyone.  The deep fried raviolis were top notch too.  We got the lettuce wrap cups and sliders.    We also did dessert, I did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing.    I am now confident I will return many, many times.

I was looking forward to another establishment this evening but due to some street fair I was unable to get in but it lead me to the Parlor and I am sooo glad it did.  The vibe was perfect and very cool but quaint and friendly.  A great crowd on this night, the staff was very helpful and friendly and ther service was great.  The food was amazing as were the prices and the wine.  Overall great experience.  The only thing, the parking lot is so tiny and hardly any available and only option was to valet and I'm not a big fan of that.

Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.    I always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.

There are not enough words in the English language to praise the awesome ness of this place, the people and the service.  Don't like the dentist? Come here. Think doctors offices will keep you waiting and will treat you like a number, not here. It's as if you have been a long lost family member. They welcome with open arms and service is impeccable. Rhonda is the sweetest and Dr. Parsanko is the most amazing dentist I have ever been to. I had 3 cavities done in one sitting and it was a breeze. Didn't even feel the needle and that is no B.S..  This office has 5 star reviews from everyone that bothers to write a review for a reason, well maybe 10 different reasons, but you get the point.

Went here on a promo, so I was a bit skeptical.  This food is awesome.  It's a great take on breakfast but what makes it different is how goooood the food is.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was perfect and delicious.  Better than I have had anywhere else.    I went with a coffee snob and he enjoyed their regular coffee, which was also an added bonus.   Service is excellent, you will never be in need of anything.    The place is tiny, tiny, so expect a wait.  That's the major draw back.

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE, what's not to love??? well, except for the lines. Even on a Tuesday in the middle of the afternoon. Seriously.   The clothes are super affordable and trendy and have better quality than other "fast fashion" retail shops.   If you can endure loud club music and sparse help and are looking for cute, trendy clothes at a super affordable price...you have found it in H&M.

Love it Love it Love it.  The girls here are great, beyond sweet, totally helpful and just awesome.  Everything you need, nice and organized, even when they have their sales and that's impressive.    It's less crowded on most days than other locations, which I enjoy.  No one truly bugs you or over services you, which I am also a fan of.   Love everything about this store.

I bought a dealchicken for this place and thought why not? $29 for a massage sounded like a good idea...until I was actually getting my massage.  The receptionist was less than pleasant..then came my massage.  It was quite possibly the worst and most uncomfortable massage I have ever received in my life, which I get regualarly.   I don't know how this place was as crowded as it was but I will not be a return customer.

This place would get a 0 if possible.  The lady was rude and mean and followed us around the crowded store.  When asked why she just looked at us, gave us a stare down and eyed me up and down like a criminal.  This place is over priced, the lady is rude and I would never spend a dime in this store.  I have heard nothing but awful things from everyone I know who has gone into this store and don'tk know how they are still in business. Now that I have experienced it myself I say move on, save your money and time and frustration.

I spend an obscene amount of money on luxury items each year and Coach is just one of the stores I frequent but this location was rubbish.  The employees were rude and pushy and tried to upsell me on everything!!  When making my purchase, I was asked about the leather cleaner which I graciously declined and was taunted, "it's only $10, if you are spending xxx on a purse, you can't afford another $10".  I almost walked out.  Had I not already given my card I would have left my purchase and walked out I was so upset.    Never again.  I will stick to the locations that aren't hard up to sell something so I can be treated decently.

I actually went to the location on Scottsdale/Shea but wanted to give a shot out to the AWESOME experience at this bank.  I have been with Bank of America (eek) for years and have finally had enough with their charges of $29 per month for my business account.  After some online research went into this location and worked with Kenny, who was amazing (all while under the weather).  He was quick and polite and really helpful.  You will feel like you are amongst family with their nice and polite customer oriented ways, not just another number FOR SURE.  I am so pleased to make this switch and cannot wait to do eveything through them all for FREE!!!

This is not against CVS but this location.  The staff is AWFUL AND MEAN.  Not patient and considering there is a Walgreens right across the street, you would be better off going there.  If I could give "0" stars I would, the experience is always that bad.    The pharmacy is not any better.  I called in a prescription and was told when I went to go pick it up that I had not done it correctly.  I had a mini altercation with the pharmacist who insisted I must not know how to use the phone system.  I have no interest in experiencing this location's employees, especially considering I am empowered with options, just as convenient.

Seriously, this place is seriously good. Like, no joke good.  I was shocked to be honest.    I've had Al's in Chicago and this place is just as good, if not better.  The place is true Chicago decor but the food...it's where it's at.  I've had the Chipotle chicken wrap, which is seriously good.  The bf has gotten the Maxwell, which is his fave but has had the dogs in multiple variations and is always pleased.  Check it out.

LOOOOOVVVEEE this place!  The staff is always super sweet and helpful and the clothes...the clothes are always on trend and to die for and reasonably priced.  As a boutique owner myself, I just absolutely adore this store!  The only downfall it is super small when it's busy and really hard to navigate without knocking everything over everything but that's a good problem to have.

The ONLY reason this place gets a 2 star is for the service.  The food was CRAP.  Overpriced and bland.  I'm not usually a fan of Casinos however this was the only option that was not a buffett or $$$$ expensive restaurant, so for a quick bit, this was it.  The scenery outside was of the back of a pool and a concrete wall, which didn't help the situation.  Oh, and you can smoke, since it's a casino I expected this but doesn't make it a preferable experience.

I am an admitted BBQ snob.  I have lived in places that make BBQ an out of body experience...so with that being said this place is AWESOME.  I mean AWESOME.  Me and the bf drove about 20 minutes out of the way to check this place out and so glad we did.    I got the meat plate and the bf got the bbq sandwhich.  He is a very non excitable man and he has not been able to stop raving about this damn BBQ all day.    My experience was quite the same.  With the beans and sweet potato fries as sides (and might I add probably the best sweet potato fries I have ever eaten) this place is top notch.  Why not the 5 stars?  The service is non existent and it's a do it for yourself kinda place.  This place is a MUST TRY!!!!

Love the brand, love the clothing. This location is always clean and orderly, though the staff could be less snobby but I don't go there for the people.  The clothes, for what they are and what you pay, last a considerable time and don't fall apart like other fast fashion brands. Cute stuff, though parking is a pain at this location.

Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.   Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself.  Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu.  We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.    The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!!  Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS F'ING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.    Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.    The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words.  Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth.  The service, very good Juan (our server) was very attentive and very helpful as it was our first time there...but it most definitely will not be our last...oh and THEY VALIDATE FOR PARKING ;)

Completely and totally unimpressed and quite disappointed.  The sushi is low quality (I'm quite the sushi nut) and the prices are quite high.  The place was dirty and the staff was rude and non attentive.    The food itself lacks taste and was put together really quickly.    We got the Vegas, Tootsie, Philadelphia and salmon rolls and usually are quite happy with that selection in other establishments but wished we would have just gone somewhere entirely different.

I found this place by accident, as it is tucked away in a strip mall with a very unassuming sign.  It has a very Chipotle like fell, with the whole "build your own" but oh so much better, which was shocking to me as well.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can really taste the difference.  They give you healthier options, which is always a nice change.  The guys who work there are ALWAYS so nice and friendly, it's hard not to go back for more.  The chicken, is by far my favorite but they have, shrimp, steak, carnitas, and a veggie option.    To make it even better, it is locally owned and operated!!

Pretty damn good.  Drove by and saw this place so decided to try it out.   Prices are reasonable and offered traditional Mediterranean meals that tasted amazing.    this should expand and overtake the larger chains that are crap.  The food did take a while to come out but there was about 8 people in line in front and considering the small operation and made to order food, I understand.

Good sandwiches, decent price, fresh ingredients all a bonus.  Service by young kids/teenagers is hit and miss but as to be expected and its a quick ordering process so it's not that painstaking.    They are generous with the ingredients and will make it to order and I like that you can get it "unwich" without the bread, wrapped in lettuce, for the low carb enthusiasts out there.  $5.50 gets you a sandwich in record breaking time, made to order with fresh ingredients, oh and they deliver too.

This was my first time here.  This place makes me wish I lived closer to Mill Ave.    Walking around Mill on a hot Saturday afternoon, looking for a place to have a snack and a drink and found this place.  The place was pretty empty when we got there and realized school's out for summer and it's a hot AZ weekend.   Ordered the chips and salsa for the app.  Impressed with both. The salsa was very different and unlike anything I've had before, also served a trio (pico, green and red).  All 3 were different and very good.  The service was top notch.  James, if I recall correctly.  He was very attentive and was more impressed with his service when I noticed the place had gotten unusually crowded in the 15 minutes or so we had been there.   We ordered some street tacos.  Upon James' suggestion, did the pork and fish tacos.  Both were superb.  The fish taco had some toppings I have never had but made it spectacular and the pork...there are no words.  With a pineapple salsa, it was amazing.  They have an extensive drink menu, especially the Tequila, hence the name of the joint. The tequila was priced within reason, especially the higher end Top, Top shelf ones.   The only reason this place did not get a 5star is the seating arrangements.  The table is especially low and you sit on bar couches that make it very difficult to not hunch over or get food all over your clothes.

This is the best DSW location I have been to, and I've been to a few.  The store is laid out very nice and organized and spacious.  Even the sales in back have more room than other locations, which is nice as those usually get the most crowded.  The shoe selection is good, I would venture a guess and say this location has a bit more in options but I can't be sure, it may just be the layout.  The staff was nice and helpful, which is a nice change from the other locations.    This is the place to go to find shoes..and more shoes...and more shoes...etc.

I really really enjoy this place.  The people and service are always nice and the food is really good.  I was a bit standoffish as I had been told it was a bit more raw than it actually turned out to be but it was the best, with the freshest tasting ingredients I have ever had at a restaurant.  A bit pricey, yes. Always crowded yes. Good food yes.

Friggin Fantastic.  If you read nothing more, that's all you need to know. In the event you want details, here they are.  The decor is very hip and swanky.  Plush chairs/coaches and seating abound.  During the day it's a fantastic eatery, at night a club.    I have been here several times and each time the service is beyond fantastic.  They are very attentive and nice and you will never go without.  The food. TO DIE FOR.  I have had the Brushetta (fig, and chicken salad are my favs) the bf had the Tenderloin omelet.  The chef had to apologize for a lack of mushrooms and compensated by extra tenderloin.  Who does that?  Only awesome places.   We were there on a Saturday during brunch and did the $10 all you can drink bubbles.  This isn't your store bought generic bubbles either and we gladly polished off a bottle (or two but who is counting, they said bottomless).    Overall, it's a great place for food and drink and the people watching is an added bonus.

LOVE LOVE LOVE X 1000.  This place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and I only wish I would have checked it out sooner.  We went on a crowded Saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations.  The staff was beyond nice and so friendly and the place was bananas packed.    The food was superb.  I mean, seriously great.  I ordered the Scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.  The Bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.  We each ordered 2 drinks a piece, which, I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for.    Then dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.  The bananas' foster was undeniabley the best dessert I have ever had.  It comes out flaming and the ice cream (we got vanilla, I detest butter pecan ice cream) was perfect to the warm goo-ey-ness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.  All in all with 4 drinks, an app, 2 meals, 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under $200..yhis place is a no brainer.

So my gf and I thought we would try this place out for lunch.  I had chosen it on a recommendation but didn't really know what to expect.  This place is LEGIT!  The second you walk in with the French music playing and the smells that just surround you, it mimics a Parisian French Bistro quite nicely.    The food. No words can describe the food.  We shared the Provancale Crepe and Montgmarte and it was absolutely to die for.  The taste and ingredients, just perfection.   The service is the owner and its a family owned in the Seville shopping center, which makes for nice afternoon shopping to walk off the many delectable calories from lunch.  Desert we got the last crepe on the menu, can't remember what it was called but it had rum and orange and it was quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had. Ever. Anywhere.   Go. Check it out. You won't be sorry.

Went to this location on a Groupon for $59 for eye exam and 2 frames so I figured I would give it a try.    The location is in PV mall and the 2 times I had called to ask was only given cross streets and not the fact that they were in the mall.  This may have changed my mind on the purchasing of the Groupon as my experience with mall eye locations have always been lackluster, and EyeStop was sadly not any better.   The selection was, well, not a selection at all.  The service was very unorganized and unprofessional.  The exam took a whopping 10 minutes total so I definitely feel like my money would have been better spent elsewhere.

Typical menu of items you would expect in a Greek place.  This place was good, fast and really generous portion sizes.  It was inexpensive too!  The food was made fresh and served quickly and not much to complain about.  All in all I would go back again.

Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings.  The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Thanksgiving every time.  Great every time.  Really good, really good service, really high quality product.  I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal.  Love this place for a fast meal.

First visit was during Happy Hour on a Friday at the Scottsdale Quarter.    Let me just say, best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials.  The sushi specials cannot be beat, dragon roll or las vegas roll for $6...that's just insanely good.   The service is top notch, we did not go without anything.  I took a sip of my ice tea, she was there to replenish.  The whole experience was amazing.  The sushi cannot be beat.  Fresh and top quality and I know my Sushi.

I keep trying to like this place and each time this place just disappoints. On this particular occasion we went and the place was empty, which is a hard feat in itself.   The food bar was messy, and most of the items were only half available. The bowls seem to keep getting smaller.   They also don't much service oriented people around, everyone was pretty snippy and rude, though the employees were congregated at the front of the restaurant playing on their cell phones and speaking inappropriately with us within ear shot.  We went the whole meal without refills and to check up on us.  I know this is a "fast food diy" concept restaurant but for the prices and the fact that there are employees doing nothing a little attention would have done well by this place.   Meh, is the best this place gets.

OBSESSED with this place.  I am so so glad they finally have a location outside of Fashion Square, although the traffic at the quarter can rival mall traffic some days.  The employees are superb and so nice and helpful.  Everything is clean and organized and they have a million of everything so you can always find what you are looking for.

I have to say there is not much than can go wrong with a restaurant the specializes in wine, cheese and all things Italian.  Went on a Saturday night while a holiday fair was being had so getting to the location was a bitch.  Parking is pretty atrocious on a regular Saturday night let alone when an event is being held.  The service is efficient and friendly nothing out of the ordinary.  Food and wine is why you come here and why I keep going back. Thank goodness for the other locations which have better parking.

Heard about this place from a Yelp-er Elite member, so I thought I would try it out.    It's unlike any sandwich shop I have ever been to.  You walk in, and you have to create your own sandwich.    The place is intimidating.  You create your own and have a MILLION options from bread to condiments to toasted to not, the list goes on and on.  You make your selections on a brown pre-printed bag and pre pay.    Let me say this, if you don't have a good idea what you want or good sandwich combinations, this is going to be a disaster.  I went with my fiance and he made a sandwich that was AWFUL.  I on the other hand really enjoyed mine.  I'm a bit of a sandwich snob truth be told.   The ingredients were fresh and the sandwich was well crafted and they definitely do not skimp on the quantity.    This place is good, really good.  Why not 5 stars?  It would have been a little better to know how to order rather than figure it out on your own.    There is also less than ample seating, which makes a big difference since it's always packed.

I didn't think I could be so turned off from a place I was so looking forward to.  Let me first say I'm a fan of Pei Wei but not this location.  The newness of this location has me expecting some serious wait times and I am okay with that.  What I am NOT okay with is the girl taking my order who is so wonderfully adorned with hickies the size of silver dollars all of her neck and also the attitude that I am bothering her by having her take my order AKA her JOB! Apparently there was a 45 minute "to go" wait that she decided to not tell me about when ordering (the restaurant itself was relatively empty so I would not have come upon this conclusion otherwise).  When I asked after 20 minutes of waiting where my food was, I was laughed at and told my someone who just got done blowing their nose and NOT washing their hands that it would be another 20-25 minutes. Appalled and disgusted.  This location and Pei Wei in general might lose my years of business because of poor management.  Don't waste your time.

Bought a Groupon 15 visit package and I'm so so so SO glad I did.  I have been dying to take real boxing classes at a gym and man oh man is this place great.  The studio is a really nice size and it's clean and by far the best smelling gym I have ever been in.    Len (the owner/trainer)  is great and so are the workouts.  It's hardcore and real boxing equipment and just a great workout and the best 45 minutes ever spent in a gym.   Do it! Seriously, just do it.

Save your money and go somewhere else.  This place is so gross, the food is bleh and the service sucks.  I just don't understand how this place has gotten as popular as it is...how can you mess up a burger?  Seriously? Or chicken wings?  Poor quality ingredients and seriously overpriced. Save your money and the stomach ache.

I came here after purchasing a Groupon.  I wanted to check it out and scheduled an appointment online, which was nice and convenient.  My appt was with Lindsay, who was amazing.  I had the best service and she was nice and sweet and just did a great job. My blow out lasted for 2 days, which is insane, considering I can't get my hair to keep curl for an hour, let alone 2 days. There was no pressure to purchase any products, although I did and am in LOVE with my Morroccan Hairspray, both the smell and the way it feels in my hair.   The salon is clean and has modern/fashion inspired decor, which I liked.   Great experience and will definitely be going back. again and again.

Seriously, this place cannot get any better.  Firstly, the people are AWESOME!!! They took the time to go through the menu with me and to boot, remembered my name from my first visit!  That's some serious customer service and talent.    On to the shakes, TO DIE FOR!!! So good and so refreshing and tastes beyond amazing.  I absolutely love this place and have been back a good 7 or 8 times since. Beware, you will become addicted.

This office is a joke.  I scheduled an appointment, was given a price after verifying my insurance and then when I was seen (a 7 min apt) I was charged 3x the price I was initially quoted, with no reason why.  They were rude and uncaring and I will never go back. There are too many doctors in this area to be treated with such disregard.
