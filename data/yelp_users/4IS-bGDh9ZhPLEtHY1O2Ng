On Sunday the 5th of may. A couple of buddies and I were craving some sushi. I recommend RA since it was close but one of my friends is a huge yelper. Won't go to any restaurant that has less that 3.5 stars. This RA on mill had 2.5..anyway I talked him into goin. They ordered a couple sushi rolls and I ordered the teriyaki bowl. My first bite was super crunchy. I immediately spit it out in and ended up spitting out shattered GLASS. There was broken GLASS all in my entree. Personally, I couldn't believe I didn't cut my mouth or swallow any of the glass. The bartender removed the plate immediately.. the manager came and said sorry asked if I was okay. He said I could get anything I wanted and they would take care of it. I was so shocked that I had GLASS in my food I lost my appetite. The manager took care of my drinks which were 2 margaritas. But my friends each had to pay for there sushi that they didn't even end up eating because they lost there appetite as well. I don't know how the manager didnt take care of the whole bill. They are lucky I didn't hurt myself while I was chewing on glass. No wonder it has 2.5 stars I will never eat at a RA restaurant after the poor experience I had while dining there.

Ate dinner here on Friday for the first time. Place was rocking with loud music and good looking people. The service I had was phenomenal..probably one of the best servers Ive ever had. I wish I knew his name but knew we wanted to take out time sharing dishes. He was on point recommending small plates and entrees. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious.

Right when I walked in the door I knew I would be coming back. Sat at the bar Cornish had great beers on draft it's like a pub setting. Sneaky spot to take a girl with a deemed lighting. I at the peppered steals and my friend at the Rueben both were housed in minutes. The bartender brought out some dipping sauces the mustard creme sauce took the cake and went really good with the peppered steak. Definitely will be back

I love this place!! I have been here multiple times. Would recommend the buffalo bill or the el Diablo. All meats are grass fed and they use the freshest ingredients possible.  For dessert try the milkshakes...recommend the salted carmel and oreo cookie combo.
