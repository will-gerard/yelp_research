Firstly, hat's off to Jenn H. who had the cojones to give this place a lousy review without also coming off as insensitive.  The story of the various Native American tribes is an incredibly solemn one that is all too often glazed over in your average grade school American History course.  I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.  Thankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an "Art Museum" by many instead of an "American History" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, "that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls" then you've totally missed the point.  The first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.  What an excellent excellent museum.  You leave much more informed and with a necessary touch of white guilt.

How have I not written a review for Blue Fin?  This isn't going to be the most useful review, because all i can say is that I agree with most of the comments others have written.    Just a word of warning.  Every single time I've been there I've melted the tastebuds off my tongue.  I try to allow my food to cool, but I just can't.  I'm impatient, and maybe a little stoopid.

C&W's is my go-to before a DBacks game, and it's only because I like the environment.  The place is clean, from the bar area to the bathrooms.  The bartenders are always fun and good for some interesting conversations.  The other patrons are generally lively and always in a good mood.  And they actually show HD sporting events on their flat screen tvs.  It doesn't boast an impressive beer selection, the food is average at best.  But I always have a good time in here.    And they don't give me funny looks for ordering a shot of jager at 11AM before an afternoon game. . .

For a sports bar located blocks from Chase Field and US Airways Arena, I don't know how they get away with having so much non-Phoenix sports memorabilia on the walls.  Only in this city!  i was in here *after* a DBacks game and it was practically empty.  They have a decent enough draught selection.  But the place itself is kind of skeevey.  The bathroom was gross and there's a window at eye level across the wall with the urinals so you can look out into the bar (maybe to keep your eye on the game?).  But it means other people can look in.  Strange.  They were showing the ASU game at the time and the TV I was seated in front of had a terrible fisheyed picture, it almost made me nauseous.  Feh.

There's no better place to catch a DBacks game, except of course for actually inside the stadium.  I went for a Saturday 5:00 game, and was shocked at how few people there were in there.  If you sit at the end of the bar, you can definitely catch a view of the live game (if you're tall enough and don't mind squirming around to avoid the obstructions of the support beams and people that actually paid for their tables).  But regardless of whether you can see or not, you still get the roar of the crowd for every big play.  Granted - the prices are a bit higher and the selection is much more limited than your average TGIFridays.  But they do have drink specials and I had chicken fingers and fries that weren't terrible.  An interesting note - the TVs inside Friday's have a significant delay from the live game (7-10 seconds) which was weird when watching the TV broadcast, hearing the crowd react to a play, waiting for it to happen on TV, then getting the reaction from the restaurant.  Also, a note on pricing for the reserved tables.  Between my wife and I, we spent $30 each on food and drinks at the bar (a single app and entree between us and 2 or 3 drinks each).  Considering that the "upper deck" tables are $30/ticket with a $30 food/beverage credit, I think that makes the most sense for a last-minute decision to go catch the game.  The "dugout" booths, which are still inside the restaurant but closer to the stadium seats are $35/ticket with only $17.50 credit - to me that makes absolutely no sense.  I didn't get a chance to see the "outside" (of the restaurant) "front row" tables, but those are $55/ticket with a $27.50 credit.  Those might be cool to try out once, but not on a regular basis.

Athenian Express is just that.  No, not "Athenian". . ."Express"!  Another in the long list of counter-service restaurants in Phoenix, this could quite possibly be the fastest ever.  After the wife and I had placed our order, we filled our fountain sodas, gawked at the impressive selection of hot sauces, selected a table to sit at, and before my butt even hit the seat the food was on its way to the table.  Impressive!  Finally a place to grab a quick, hassle-free lunch.  And, well, since they aren't open past 5:00PM or on weekends at all anyway, I guess this place has figured out its niche - the downtown lunch crowd.  They offer a huge variety of subs, pitas, and salads, most of which are your normal deli standards.  Most of the actual Greek offerings aren't even listed on the regular menu but as "sides" - falafel, spanakopita, dolmades, hummus.  We ordered a gyro and a falafel platter. Be forewarned, the "garnish" that comes with the falafel pita is essentially a side salad, I made the mistake of getting the side salad instead of one of the other sides and had two big mounds of veggies.  Not a big deal, just something to know for next time.    The food itself wasn't spectacular by any means.  In fact, dare I say the gyro meat looked pre-pacakged and was DEFINITELY not freshly shaved off a big rack of lamb, the pieces were waaaay too uniform in size and shape.  But hey, 2 super-quick large meals and huge sodas for $15 works for me!

Alright.  I'm going to be the bad guy and give the AZ Science Center a 2 star rating.    In my mind, the key to a successful hands-on exhibit is: 1. Demonstrate a cool science topic with a "wow" factor that grabs my attention 2. Now that you've got my attention, explain *what* just happened, and *why* it happened.  TEACH ME SOMETHING.  The exhibits in this museum are SEVERELY lacking in the second half.  You have to understand I'm a 5-year old science geek at heart.  Which means I love to play with toys, but I also love to find out what makes the toys tick.  Push down on this platform and a smoke ring ejects from a big box.  Wow that was cool.  What made that happen?  Oh, no explanation, I guess I'll move onto the next exhibit...  Pull on the rope positioned higher on the lever and it's easier to move than pulling on the rope positioned lower.  Wow, that was cool.  What made that happen?  Oh, no explanation, I guess I'll move onto the next exhibit...  Turn on a light that projects an upside-down image through a lens and appears right-side-up on the wall.  Wow, that was cool.  What made that happen?  Oh, no explanation, I guess I'll move onto the next exhibit...  You can see the pattern here.  Another big beef I had was that there were way too many stations for kids to just play with legos or draw with crayons or make origami.  "This is how a house is built.  Draw a house on paper with crayons..."  The most egregious in this category was the Ford sponsored Robots gallery.  Lots of playing with dominos, drawing with crayons, and reading quotes from your favorite movie robots.  That's it.  No joke.  Nothing informative at all.  And I stupidly paid extra for it.  I'm sure that with a good rotating exhibit, the museum would have garnered a third star from me.  By far the saving grace of this museum is the live demonstrations, where they do actually teach you something while wowing you with such things as exploding fireballs.    But honestly, the museum itself felt like a big playground for kids with ADD to run amok.  I know some people are going to think "It's a museum for kids, it's supposed to be that way."  Well, that's true to an extent, but the museum should be both fun AND INFORMATIVE, not fun and pointless.  You might as well take your kid to a Chuck E Cheese for fun and pointless.  At least they might walk away with a back scratcher or a kazoo, as opposed to walking away with nothing...

Agree with all the great reviews, had to throw in my 4 stars and word of warning -  I came here for lunch and ordered the half sandwich/cup o soup combo.  The chicken soup was bland and had a lot of corn in it which I've never seen before.  The roasted veggie sandwich was a lot of bread and not a lot of roasted veggies (should have read Sarah's review. . .doh!)  But everything else that everyone in the place was having looked amazing - burger, chicken caesar sandwich, chicken soft tacos, salads. . .my lunch mates were more than happy with their orders.  I happened to pick the two underwhelming items.  Poop.

Had to throw in my 2 cents.  If you read about the event, then you may know I was once an avid bowler in a former life.  Shoes, I owned a pair.  Ball, custom made.  Leagues, I was in several.  Which is why I hate bowling these days.  Huh?  Alleys these days try to be all trendy and crap.  They all look like a Scottsdale lounge with big couches and funky videos playing in the background.   And on any given weekend night you might get "cosmic" or "glow" bowling with the same thumping music and strobe lights you might find in a Scottsdale lounge!  The most egregious of these types of places is Lucky Strike in Boston (though Kings comes in a close second).  Bleck.  Not to mention they charge like $10 a game.  Which is why Sunset Bowl gets 4 stars.  My perfect alley is straight out of The Big Lebowski.  Complete with broken ball returns, balls that have extra holes drilled in them for no apparent reason, pool tables with ripped up felt, and the original Virtua Fighter arcade game.  $3 for shoes, $2.50 a game, $6 pitchers of beer.  Heaven.  The only way this place would have been better was if they had the old-school desks and overhead projectors to keep your own score.  But I doubt anyone these days is capable of keeping their own score - math is for computers.  Bah!  To their credit, the automatic scoring system would mess up and give/take an extra point on about 25% of the tosses.  Stellar.   "The Dude abides. . ."

I had called the 800 number from the web site last Wednesday to place an order for a fairly expensive bouquet of exotic flowers for my wife for our anniversary.  To make sure I fully surprised her, I set up the bouquet for delivery for this past Sunday, so I wouldn't have to "run out for a second" to pick it up.  I live in a gated complex and gave them all the information they needed to enter the complex and find my unit.  On Saturday, I called back to make sure they had all of the proper information and to call my cell phone if there were any problems with delivery.  I even additionally requested that the delivery occur with what they term the "second batch" of deliveries that are supposed to go out at 2PM to make sure we were around, as we were going to get brunch that morning.  Sunday came and went, no flowers.  I called back this morning (Monday) and they explained that they attempted delivery but couldn't get through the gate.  I know for a fact they never attempted delivery because I never received the phone call from the front gate.  They added another whopper when they claimed to have called me and left a message when they couldn't get in.  My cell phone hadn't rang all day.  They get another star for cancelling my order without a hassle.  My wife will be getting a Tiffany necklace instead which was only a little more expensive (have to make up for being a day late) but will hopefully last much longer.

Hmph.  Can't do negative stars, can't do 0, so 1 will have to do.  I could write a novel on all of the terrible things that BofA has perpetrated on my wife and I.  Since this location is where I had my final straw before closing my account, it will take the brunt of my anger.    Ready for the novel?  Let me preface by saying I never wanted BofA.  I had Fleet in Boston which is my favorite bank of all time (I've had accounts with 6 banks, just from moving so many times).  They were so good, apparently they didn't make enough money (as they don't nickel and dime you) so BofA bought them out, and it went downhill for me fast.  1. I had a totally free checking account with Fleet - no monthly fee, no ATM fees, no fee to see a human teller at the bank, nothing.  BofA transferred my account as a free account.  Then a few months later they changed it and started charging me a monthly fee.  Then a few months after, they started hitting me with ATM fees - every time I used a non-BofA ATM, not only did I have to pay the fee at the ATM but then BofA was kind enough to tack on a $2 charge.  I'd get hit with $4 or more total if I needed cash and couldn't find a BofA ATM where I was.  Then, when I got married, I had a lot of checks from gifts I had to deposit so I went and saw an actual teller to deposit the checks, and they charged me for that.  2. I had a savings account with Fleet that I used to save for wedding costs.  It became BofA before I got married.  When I got married, I emptied the savings except for like $75.  6 months after getting married, I got a letter in the mail saying my SAVINGS ACCOUNT had gone NEGATIVE.  Huh?  I checked back through my old statements, I had just been glossing over the savings account information, only to find out they had been charging me $15 a month for not meeting a minimum balance.  ON A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.  I called them up and had them refund me back to $0 and closed the account.  Get this, the woman asked me if I wanted to set up a "free savings account".  I HAD ONE AND YOU STARTED CHARGING ME ON IT!  3. I tried to use their "free" online bill pay once.  I had a bill due a few days after I got paid, so I set it up to pay the day after I was paid.  To my surprise, BofA deducted my account for the payment A WEEK IN ADVANCE.  It left me with pennies to my name for a week.  I called and complained and was told it was standard practice.  Never used their online bill pay again.  4. When I got married, my wife closed her account and I put her on mine as a joint account.  Except since we hadn't yet received her new social security card or gotten her a new driver's license, we put it under her maiden name.  Once she had all the proper documentation, we tried to change her name.  They issued her a new debit card with her old name.  Three times she tried to get the proper name on the debit card and three times they sent her one with her maiden name on it.  As if that wasn't bad enough, somehow they changed the account that was originally under my name to be a joint account under her maiden name and under her married name, and my name disappeared from statements completely.  5.  The final straw came when we accidentally overdrew our account. Somehow our out of state rent check cleared in 3 days instead of the standard week!  I put the check in the mail on Saturday.  On Monday, I checked my account online and I had money.  On Tuesday, same thing.  On Wednesday, same thing.  On Thursday, I checked my account and not only had the rent cleared overdrawing my account, but they back-dated it to Monday and hit me with overdraft fees on the 10 small purchases I had made Mon-Wed (gas, lunch, whatever).  $250 in fees!  So I went in to this branch to complain and DeAnn was less than helpful.  In fact, condescending.  I just wanted an explanation of why they screwed me so hard by backdating the check clearing when they could have just cleared it properly and hit me with a single $25 overdraft fee.  What I got was a lecture on finances.  Thanks DeAnn, I'm very good with money, this is the first time in my life I've overdrawn an account, I don't need your lecture.  I need an explanation of why I'm being charged $250 for what should have been a single overdraft.  "There's nothing I can do, you should budget properly."  Budgeting properly has nothing to do with the way the bank is messing with the dates to screw me.  Then, the icing on the cake, "If you want I can set it up so that an overdraft simply charges your credit card and you don't get hit with fees."  WHAT?!  NOW YOU TELL ME THIS?!  Funny thing, I had this when I had my account with Fleet, apparently BofA decided to not transfer that aspect of my account over, even though I have a credit card through them that shows up on the same statement as my bank account!  So long story long, I immediately pulled my funds from BofA, opened an account with WaMu, and have been slightly less stressed.

Yep, dudes get their hair done here too.  I don't know what it is about haircuts for me.  My head must be a funny shape, or my hair must be a funny texture, or maybe I squirm a lot in the chair.  Or maybe my hair just has expensive taste in stylists.  I don't know.  What I do know is that, for some reason, it's hard for me to find someone who can make me look good (hair I mean, not face or physique, I can't find ANYBODY to fix those).  Quick tangent - as a teenager, my stylist in NY was the guy who did the hair for Miss Universe 2001 (Puerto Rico) and 2002 (Russia).  If you're wondering, I'm heterosexual and happily married.  Anyway, Bernadette is a magician when it comes to my hair.  Every 6-8 weeks, she transforms the pile of crap I bring to her on the top of my head into something, dare I say, sexy.  I've been to other places in the Valley, and even other stylists at Par, and I would always leave more depressed then when I walked in.  Not with Bernie.  She's also cute and fun, which doesn't hurt.  Yes, it's a tad more expensive than Super Cuts.  But it's a guarantee that I walk out happy.  And showing off the new 'do is a great excuse to go upstairs to Sol Y Sombra.

Had to throw in my 5 stars.  Just got a dog from the Campus for Compassion, what an incredible facility.  I volunteered at an animal shelter in my hometown for years and I was absolutely blown away by the size, cleanliness, and amenities here.    My wife and I found the perfect puppy and she was in our car on the way to her new home in about an hour.  Spayed, vaccinated for rabies and bordetella, micro-chipped, registered, and with a free bag of dog food for only $116.  And the $500 free vet care on top is great - a vet visit alone will run $40-$60 not including the tests for heartworms and other parasites that are necessary when adopting a dog (and that's if the dog you're adopting is healthy. . .)  Of course there is just one problem.  My place is too small to adopt more animals.

Asking yourself "what is the point of this magazine" is like trying to find meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.    There is no point!  Just sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be entertained.  Are you really expecting any sort of intellectual stimulation out of this magazine?    944 Magazine is the perfect reading material when you're sitting on the toilet pushing one out.  You can go cover to cover in the 5-10 minutes you're on the john, laugh hysterically at points, get depressed over the future of society at other points, and otherwise keep yourself entertained.  And a bonus is that every once in a while you might find an event or new restaurant opening that piques your interest.    And in the end, it's great for squishing scorpions.  Not to mention IT'S TOTALLY FREE.  I guess if you paid money for it, I can understand a little resentment.  But for a free throw-away?  Give me a break.  944 serves it's purpose perfectly.

When I found out Cowboy Ciao was doing restaurant week, I jumped at the opportunity.  I had only heard great things, and with the RW prix fixe how can you lose?  You can't.  I am almost never impressed enough by a place during Restaurant Week to either want to go back or want to recommend it to others. With Cowboy Ciao, I will definitely be doing both.  I started with the famous Stetson Chop Salad and I don't think I've ever been so much in love with a salad.  The combination of salty and sweet and crunchy and creamy was amazing.  I went with another famous dish for my entree, the mushroom pan fry, and I was very pleased.  Very interesting and delicious.  For RW, the dessert offering was a trio of 2 different cookies and banana peanut butter cake, I don't believe this is on the regular menu.  One word about that cake - orgasmic.  I was so dazed off the great food, I can't even remember what my wife had for her entree, but I know she enjoyed it!  For RW, they even gave a complimentary glass of wine which is a nice added bonus not normally offered at other restaurants during RW.  Perhaps the best thing about the meal, though, was the fact that the salad and entree were regular sized portions and didn't show a hint of lower quality than what I assume you would get on an average night.  And at $29 for the three courses and glass of wine, it was a total steal.  Best money I ever spent.  The only down side with Cowboy Ciao, and I have the same problem with Kaz, is the novel of a wine list.  Firstly, my wife and I were trying to decide on a bottle and the waiter, though friendly and helpful in other areas, had no clue about any of the wines we were contemplating.  With a wine list that big, the place really needs a dedicated sommelier.  My second problem with the wine list is that it's organized by price and not by type of wine or growing region, which makes finding your choices for a specific type nearly impossible.  Want a bottle of sauvignon blanc under $35?  You've got about 30 choices, scattered through 10 pages of white wines.  So if you don't want to start your meal with a headache, stick to beer or cocktails.  Hell, just get a glass of water and let the food get you drunk.

Am I stuck in some weird dream?  Are we really at a table in the aisle of a wine store with a shopping cart seated at the head of the table? (yes, see photo)  (***UPDATE*** Yelp decided ALMOST 2 YEARS LATER that my photo of THE INSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT was "specific to my experience" and therefore "not appropriate for the general business listing"...Yelp is too funny...)  Did the store clerk really just tell me to not get my good trusted bottles of wine and instead suggest three of the most putrid wines I've ever had?  Does the menu really have the phrase "in season" in quotes, as if the food isn't really in season but they are pretending it is?  Are there really people in this "restaurant" (see the use of quotes there?) loudly cheering for the Iowa Warhawks game?  Was I really just served cold duck confit?  Am I really eating it?  Did they really just charge me $10/bottle corkage fee on wine I paid for at the cash register 5 feet away?  Did I really just wait 20 minutes for someone to take my credit card?  2 stars because *overall* the food was good (even if my duck was cold).

I've never actually stayed in the hotel (though I'm planning on it on my next trip).  I've only gambled here, and I love it.  Right down to the smell of the casino (yes, the smell).  And I always win money here.  The dealers are all very friendly and so too are the other gamblers.  I have run into many a sour dealer/gambler in other casinos.  Never once here.  And this is the nicest casino I've found that ALWAYS has $10 blackjack tables (even during extremely busy holiday weekends).  Especially considering its location near Caesars, Venetian, Wynn, etc.  And I'm not talking continuous shuffle or single deck like you find at the other classy places around here for $10 min - this is real, 6 deck blackjack, dealt from the shoe.  They do use an auto-shuffler in between shoes, which doesn't really give you that break in play to go to the bathroom or buy some smokes.  But other than that minor gripe, this place has never done me wrong.

Since moving to downtown Phoenix almost a year ago, one of the biggest things I miss about N. Scottsdale is Satori.  Seriously.  Sad, right?  The sushi was solid and the Double-up (2-4-1) Sundays and Mondays meant you could order enough sushi to feed a small nation and not break the bank.  $30 between two people and you've got 6-8 large, well prepared rolls.  The place has 0 ambiance, but at the price who gives a damn?  If there is a similar place somewhere in central/downtown phoenix, can someone please let me know ASAP????

Update to the update.  Who knew moving from Scottsdale to Central Phx would mean I would give up the (albeit craptastic) OnDemand service, which isn't offered for Phoenix residents!    Apparently they also charge Phoenix residents more money for what is obviously fewer services.  And the kicker - my new apartment is pre-wired for ethernet with CAT-5 jacks in every room, but when Cox came to set me up again they insisted they couldn't wire my internet through the existing wiring.

Great independent urban cafe with ultra friendly staff, great drinks, and decent munchables.  It's a good size so even when there are a bunch of people there you can still take up a spot at a table and get into your own little world - whether that be reading, laptop hacking, or whatever.  The Downtown Dash (free bus service) runs right in front of Fair Trade, and there is a stop right on Central for the light rail too once that starts up, so it's damn easy to get to.  The one drawback is that they don't have tomatoes or onions or really any other accouterments for their sandwiches. . .which makes their "salads" just a bed of lettuce with your desired protein on top (basically the sandwich sans bread).  But whatever, I still love their curry chicken salad on multi grain bread.  And they have this coffee flavored jello that is really really good - they serve it in what I believe is a cappuccino mug with whipped cream on top.  Mmmmm.  They also have recently started Sushi and Jazz nights on certain Fridays (not all) from 6-9.  Ok, obviously they don't offer an extensive amount of sushi, and it isn't stellar nor is it really that cheap, but the woman who makes it is just the sweetest person on earth.  And the jazz is more like a keyboardist schmoozing with his friends and every now and again playing a tune.  But hey, I just love the atmosphere here.

I know I just wrote a review for this place, but I just discovered even more to love about it.  I had known about their  quiches and pastries and went to go get some with an iced coffee on Sunday morning.  What do you know, they offer a real breakfast as well on Sundays from 8-12!    I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was sort of like a frittata with sour cream and fresh salsa.  It was awesome.  And it was only like $5 and came with rosemary potatoes.  Mmmm.  I brought my dog with me and they were super cool about it.  They brought the food out to me in the courtyard and even brought a milk bone and bowl of water for the dog.

You know how the commercial says "Open Til Midnight Or Later" and then there's a little asterisk and nearly illegible text at the bottom of the screen in 1pt font that says "Participating locations only"  This is not a participating location.  :(

First visit here was on a Saturday at 7 with a group of 10 for a birthday.  We had a table in the upstairs section which was really nice.  They allowed us to bring balloons and confetti and other decorations and set the table up before the guest of honor arrived.  They also allowed us to bring our own cupcakes.  Service was great - we only had two hours for the entire meal because we had a tight schedule for the other festivities of the night.  The waitress had no problem with that, took our drink and entree orders right away, and everything came out super quick.  Unfortunately we didn't order apps due to the time constraint.  But most of us shared our entrees and they were great almost across the board.  The winner of the night in everyone's mind was the Forbidden Rice which had the most exotic, refreshing, floral type of taste (jasmine maybe?).  I personally had the green chile stew which was spiced perfectly and the portion was deceivingly hearty despite it's small size.  The wifey ordered the whitefish which was cooked well and the broth was fantastic.  However, there was a large hunk of fish spine (bone) attached to the fillet which was incredibly off putting.  We didn't speak up about it because everything else was so good and it was easy for my wife to close her eyes while I removed the offending bone.  The salmon salad had a huge portion of grilled salmon atop greens and though I didn't taste it because I'm not a salmon fan, my friend really enjoyed the dish.  The loser of the night was the "Wood Roasted Seasonal Vegetables" side dish, which was a plate of incredibly over cooked mushy brussel sprouts (which is "vegetable" singular not "vegetables" plural) that seemed braised and not roasted on account of the mushiness.  All had a great time and I look forward to trying St. Francis again.

FOURTH MEAL!  24 hour drive thru!  And it's right off the 101 so coming back to my place from a night of drinking in old town or phoenix, it's quick and easy to stop here.

Pei Wei makes me sad.  Sad because it is literally the ONLY "Chinese" food a downtown resident of the 5th largest city in the country can get for lunch on a lazy hungover Sunday afternoon.  :-(

After picking out my new-to-me car, I came here for financing.  They offer a 5 year loan at a minimum of 6.9% interest.  Unfortunately my credit score (which I think is pretty darn good) was a massive 7 POINTS from qualifying for that, and they had to give me a 7.24% loan.  No big deal.  They had no problem financing the 8 year old car with 98K miles I was about to purchase.  In just over an hour, I was in and out with a check in my hands ready to get my car.  And with the only requirement being a $25 deposit in a savings account.  UPDATE: I have had several phishing scam emails sent to me that look like AZFCU emails.  All have asked me to take a survey for $X reward.  They look pretty legit with only a few barely noticable differences between the real AZFCU web site and the ones the phishing emails direct you to.  I don't really want to dock AZFCU for this, so this is more of a word of warning.  NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR ACCOUNT INFO!

Another new-to-me car, another hassle free loan from AZFCU.  I actually tried Desert Schools FCU first who quoted me an outrageous 12% rate!  Screw that!  Back to AZFCU, where in about an hour I had all the paperwork completed for my 7% loan and a check in my hands.  The only real drawback is that I can't pay the loan online.  Well, at least not from another bank account, my regular checking account is with Chase.  On their website, all you can do is check your loan balance and make a payment from another AZFCU account.  So this remains the last establishment for which I actually write a paper check.  Cute.

This was pretty damn close to the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.  I made the mistake of coming here for brunch on a saturday morning with the wifey while being wallet-raped by Danny's Car Wash for an oil change (see review).   It was open and across the street and I'd heard about it, so I figured what the hell. Big mistake, this meal didn't help my mood.     The build your own omelette and bloody mary seemed great on paper.  I didn't even care that I had a waitress-in-training that had absolutely no clue what was going on.  After all, I had time to kill.  I guess taking a piece of paper from a diner to the cook and bartender is difficult labor requiring highly skilled and specialized employees.  But wait!  The bartender doesn't know how to make a mimosa?  A retarded monkey could make a mimosa.  In between flinging feces on the walls and picking fleas out of its hair.  That, at least, would have been entertaining.  So I'm going over my omelette choices.  No green bell peppers?  For real?  A "mexican" joint with no green bell peppers?  I actually wrote it in, hoping that this was an egregious oversight by the menu-making committee and they did actually have them.  I finished selecting my omelette fixins, including "chorizo".    I received a plate with a pound of dog food and jalapeno peppers wrapped in an egg.  I'm positive not one morsel of this mystery meat was USDA approved for human consumption, let alone a massive pile of it.  And I'm positive jalapenos are not bell peppers.  You know what?  In retrospect, this was the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.    Don't come here for food.

**WARNING** DO NOT COME HERE THINKING YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET "ONLY" AN OIL CHANGE AND CAR WASH!  I came to this Danny's because I figured it was a convenient location in a huge shopping area - I could drop my car off and run errands.  All I wanted was an oil change and car wash, and they weren't having it.  The guy haggled with me for literally almost 15 minutes to get their other detailing services or window tints.  Dude, I just want an oil change and a car wash!  After about 10 minutes I got fed up and wanted to get on with my day, so I figured I'd throw him a bone and asked for the wheel polish service since they were kind of grimey anyway and that was the cheapest "additional" service.  Still, he was RELENTLESS in selling me the full detailing package, at a mere 5x the price than for just the oil change and wash!  After another 5 minutes of haggling with me, I finally caved and got the full service for only 3x more than what I wanted.  What a deal!  So we agreed on the price which was "all inclusive" (even tax) and I was told that the car would be ready in an hour and a half.  After 2 hours I called them up, it seriously took the girl 10 minutes to find out if my car was ready, and of course she told me it would be another 10 minutes.  I went to pick up my car and found out that they were charging me $20 over the quoted price because "my car needed an extra quart of oil" (is my oil reserve somehow bigger than normal???!!!!) and "a special oil filter" (???!!!).  To me, when someone says "all inclusive" that means there will be no additional fees. Apparently I was mistaken.  Thanks for ripping me off Danny!  Of course arguing with them did me no good, if I didn't pay up they weren't giving me my car back.  What takes the cake is that on the receipt it said they "checked" my air filter and "noted" that I need to get that changed.  If you're already checking the air filter and selling me services I don't want or need at 3x the price of the basics, then just freaking change the damn air filter.  You can even charge me for it and claim it was just as "special" as the extra quart of oil and the oil filter.  They did do a really good job though, and the car looks fantastic inside and out.  So if you really want to shell out a lot of money for expensive detailing services, this is the place.  But I will never be coming back for "just an oil change and car wash" and I don't recommend anyone else to try to get away with that either!

Ok, it's a J in the B.  Stupid to write a review.  But I rarely eat fast food and almost NEVER J in the B.    During a recent adventure in S Phoenix, I was in need of some lunch and this was the only place around.  Well, this and a Whattaburger, so my choices were pretty limited.  Wow.  This place is CLEAN.  And the woman who took my order was both FRIENDLY and COMPETENT.  My order came out QUICKLY and was CORRECT.  All things I usually never experience at fast food joints, or at least all at once.  5 stars.

I've been here twice, both times I ate at the bar.  This place is a generic hotel restaurant.  I've had the shrimp po boy sliders and the meatloaf sliders.  Don't even bother...while tasty, each dish comes with two sliders the size of half dollars.  The shrimp was especially meager as each slider had a single fried popcorn shrimp.    Last time I was here with my wife and a friend, we tried to sit at one of the high top tables next to the bar, but apparently for no good reason you cannot order entrees at the high tops (though you can at the bar).  So they forced us to squeeze into a space at the bar instead of allowing us to enjoy our meal in comfort.  The bartender had a better than thou attitude, also for no good reason.  My wife got the lobster pot pie which was nothing like a real pot pie one would get in New England.  My friend got the salmon which she did not like.  Neither of them finished their meals.  To top it off, some creepy old drunk dude who was there for a conference was obnoxiously hitting on my friend, to the point where he was physically groping her.  This continued to happen right in front of the bartender who did nothing to stop the situation.  I was forced to literally take the guy  outside and tell him that if he touched my friend again he'd spend the rest of the night in the hospital.  Hopefully I don't have to spend another sorry minute in this place.

More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did.  I just wanted to beat them all to the punch.  To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail:  1. The good-not-great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time.   2. Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story. 3.  Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ.

Wow.  This was an experience and a half.  I came here with the wifey in search of tacky christmas sweaters for a tacky christmas sweater party.  We certainly were not disappointed to this end.  The inventory and variety of tacky sweaters was outstanding.  However, this place  is downright creepy.  We were two of maybe a handful of people in the place not on meth (including the employees).  How could I tell?  There were at least 8 instances of near-collisions with my cart and other carts/people just running around the store trying to burn off some meth-energy.  Methergy?  Look at that, I coined a new word.  This place would be a dentist's nightmare.  I'm sure there were fewer collective teeth in all of walmart than the number of available tacky sweaters.  There were unsupervised kids running amok EVERYWHERE.  One particular boy who couldn't have been older than 7 was climbing on a bunch of shelves on a display in the women's clothing section and was wearing a "Say NO to spitting tobacco" shirt.  Well I guess that's a good message, if not slightly odd.  There were lots of toddlers with crap all over their faces, as if they had just chowed down on some chocolate cake or something and then mom was like, "Ok, time to go to Walmart!" without bothering to wipe them off.   One funny incident is worth repeating here.  In the grocery section (which I have to admit, is actually very well stocked) there was a display of Coca Cola bottles that were small and spherical in the shape of Christmas ornaments.  I remark "Wow those are cool" and a meth head behind me yells, "WOW!  THOSE ARE REALLY COOL" and then proceeds to try to get his wife's attention at the other end of Walmart to show her just how cool they were.  "SHEEEEEEEILA!  SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEILA!  LOOK AT THIS!  LOOK!"  It boggles my mind how the Target right around the corner from here is INFINITELY nicer than this Walmart.  Go there instead.  Unless you're looking for a tacky Christmas sweater.

The menu only exists in order to know what the restaurant doesn't have.  I understand it's only been open a little over a month, but running out of just about everything means they are very poorly managed and have a very poor business model.  I was here twice in April, "New England" month.  Unfortunately for them, I lived in Boston for 5 years.  Let's hope they don't try to do New England ever again in the future.  The chowder was terrible.  The RI style calamari was a joke.  There were literally 5 pieces of squid on the plate (and no lemon).  After those, I was too scared to order any of the other regional dishes.  On my first visit, very shortly after they had opened, a friend ordered a Mai Tai right off the specialty drink menu.  It was served to her and she immediately noticed it was the wrong color.  "Where's the dark rum?"  "Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it."  Note to bartender - if someone orders a drink and you don't have the right ingredients, ask if they would mind a substitution.  My bet is that they might order something different.  Later in the month on the second trip, we tried to order the crab mac and cheese.  Nope, sorry, out of crab mac and cheese.  So instead I ordered the Chop Salad.  Amazingly, it didn't have pine nuts and the smoked salmon somehow turned into grilled salmon.  By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.  Rather than attempt to fix the situation, the bartenders and servers all started to ignore us.  Finally the manager came over and I explained to him that what I had received in the Chop Salad wasn't anywhere close to what was described on the menu.    He literally asked me, "Oh, are you in the business?"    No, I just happen to be able to read, and I just happen to know what I'm eating.    He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.  Note to manager - smoked salmon, pine nuts, crab mac and cheese, and dark rum are not rare, exotic ingredients.  You run out of something, you go buy more.  Or you explain to customers that what they ordered isn't what they will get.  Apparently he didn't like hearing that there are some people that know the difference, and he started to treat us in a very condescending manner.  I'm not the douchebag here, buddy.  Clearly, YOU are the douchebag.  If you don't know how to run a restaurant, don't become a restaurant manager.  Simple.  Oh, lest I forget.  We had actually ordered 2 chop salads after being told that they counted under the 2-for-1 entrees grand opening special.  When we got the check, we had to have the bartender remove one of the salads as we were charged for both.  Almost got us, Regions.  Almost got us.  Since my group was in a small rush to get to the La Bocca Yelp event, the manager - Keith? Kyle? Kevin? - offered to buy us a round if we came back later.  Not ones to ever refuse free alcohol, we did return later in the night after the yelp event.  And we brought lots of friends - our group of 5 turned into 11, all ready and willing to give Regions our business.  Lo and behold, the manager didn't comp us a round of drinks, even though we made it clear that's why we had returned and we were wiling to stay there if shown some love.  All he had to do was take the 5 kamikaze shots off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night.  Guess not.  Well done.  Love the honesty.  In conclusion:  food sucks, service sucks, management SUCKS.  But it benefits from a great location, so I'll probably wind up giving it another chance when in Tempe/Mill Ave.

Not sure how to structure this review because I have a lot to say, so bear with me.  How about getting to the point first...  Ambiance: 2 stars Food: 3.5 stars Service: 10 stars Value: 10 stars Total: 3.5 stars rounded up  I took my wife here the Saturday before Valentine's Day since, alas, I travel for business and wasn't going to be around for V-Day itself.  :-(  Upon walking in, my wife remarked that it smelled like her grandparents house.  You mean like chicken soup and death?  I had the same reaction.  It made sense, the next youngest patron there was a good 40 or 50 years our senior.  You could smell the formaldehyde.  Now to a word of warning.  ***THIS PLACE IS NOT ROMANTIC****  I can't stress that enough.  I don't think people in the valley know what a truly romantic French dining experience is.  This place is cozy - as in the NYC definition.  Meaning that it is small, cramped, loud, you will hear all the conversations around you (which in OTS can get pretty ridiculous), and it is guaranteed that you will either ask the table next to you what they are eating or be asked what you are eating (both happened to us).  To top it off, there was a very bright fake candle on the table in an absolutely horrid candle holder.  Lastly, they had the most ridiculous music playing.  Seriously, I heard the Canne Canne blaring out of the speakers and all I could think of was the old Shoprite commercial with the dancing cans.  A real romantic French dining experience is quiet, reserved, sophisticated, and of course has real candles on the table and classier music (if any at all).  We had a 7:00 reservation and wound up getting there 15 min early and the table wasn't ready.  Which was totally fine, we could just grab a glass of champagne at the bar.  There were two open seats but the bar top had place settings in front of them.  So I asked the bartender if we could grab a quick drink there while our table was being prepared.  He informed me that those spots had been reserved and unnecessarily relegated us to a tiny spot at the corner of the bar.  Our table was ready in about 7 minutes, in that time the "reserved" seats at the bar were never filled.  Ugh.  The food was good but not the best French food I've had.  I was expecting more classical French and this was definitely more Provencal.  We went with four courses - first we shared the escargot, which  was ok (anything drowning in butter and garlic is going to be...) but the pastry dough on top was hard and chewy and not flakey.  Next, I had the foie gras which again was good but not the best I've had, it was unfortunately a little flavorless.  I really like to taste the nuttiness of foie gras.  My wife had the steak tartare and had the same remark that it was basically flavorless.  For our entree we split the bouillabaisse, which was quite good.  However, it is served with a few pieces of toasted bread with a roasted red pepper sauce that was just totally unnecessary - the whole point of the bread is to soak up the broth of the bouillabaisse!  So I had to ask for some plain toasted bread which was happily provided.  To finish, we had the cheese plate which was again pretty unremarkable - a gruyere, a bleu, a brie, and I forget what the last cheese was (see...unremarkable).  Onto the service.  Firstly, the reason why a real classy French restaurant would not survive in the valley is because people are too impatient.  A four course meal can and should be a 2+ hour experience.  Eat a little, drink a little, gaze lovingly into your partner's eyes, have deep conversations about life.  Many of the patrons here complained that their food was taking too long.  To the point where our waiter kept apologizing to us without our saying anything, and I had to reassure him that we actually appreciated the pace of the meal.  Our server, Chad, was fantastic.  He recommended a great by-the-glass wine that was not on the menu.  When our second course arrived (after the escargot), I had to ask for a change of plates and utensils, to which he exclaimed "of course!" and hurried to get.  After that, the plates and silverware were changed after every course.  Chad was very attentive to us without being overbearing, even though it appeared he was the only server for half of the restaurant.  He may have been a little too apologetic at times, but I will take that over totally obnoxious and uncaring.  Lastly, to the value - our 4 course meal (well, a split first and last course) + 2 glasses champagne + 3 glasses wine came to $145.  To me, that is a great value for French food.  Of course, I may be a little out of touch, as our last French cuisine experience was at Joel Robouchon in Las Vegas which came to $600.  In all honesty, I probably won't ever return to Petite Maison.  It is definitely a "special occasion" type of place, and there are nicer/better places that I like more.

This isn't so much a problem with this particular store as it is with Sony products and customer support.  Regardless, take this as a warning and do not purchase any Sony products.  Even if you don't take my word for it, go ahead and read many similar experiences at http://www.consumeraffairs.com/computers/sony.htm  I had a Sony Vaio laptop that I purchased about 8 months ago fry one day.  I plugged the ac adapter into the laptop, plugged it into the wall, and my laptop started smoking.  I quickly unplugged everything but alas, the laptop no longer turned on, and the little green LED on the ac adapter didn't light up when it was plugged in.  Obviously the ac adapter was defective and sent way too much current to the laptop and burnt it up.  I brought it into this store to get it repaired.  A fancy, expensive laptop should last more than 8 months, so certainly this defective piece of crap would be covered under warranty.  The sales associate put the laptop through a battery of tests (including a battery test...har-de-har-har) and came to the exact same conclusion.  I handed him the receipt for the purchase of the laptop 8 months prior, he agreed that the repair would be covered under warranty, I filled out a work order form and left my poor laptop in his care.  What followed was nothing short of abusive.  3 weeks passed and I had received no contact from Sony.  I pulled out my work order receipt and saw that I could check the status of my repair online.  I attempted, but apparently my work order number wasn't found, so I called this store.  I was informed that my warranty work had been denied and that they had attempted to contact me (lie #1).  He put me through to the general customer service line, and the agent there gave me the runaround about why the warranty work was denied.  She then put me through to the repair center, where the agent there told me, and I quote, "we found liquid *in* your laptop."  (lie #2).  If there was liquid in the laptop, it happened somewhere between the Sony Style store and the repair center.  He went on to tell me that there was "a massive amount of corrosion" and that there was no way the work would be covered under warranty and it would cost $650 to repair.  After arguing with this guy for a good 30 minutes, which ended with him saying he would email me the pictures of the corroded motherboard (lie #3 - never happened), I requested the laptop be returned to me and verified my address with him, the exact same address that was on the work order.  2 more weeks passed and I had no contact from Sony.  So I called customer service back and they informed me that it had already been delivered (lie #4).  OH HELLLLLLLL NO.  The agent verified my address again and, wouldn't you know it, they left off my apartment number.  Turns out the laptop was sitting at Fed Ex because it couldn't be delivered.  I went to pick the laptop up and, coincidentally, there was another guy there picking up a Vaio that was sent back to him from the repair center with no apartment number!  The cherry on top - I got the laptop home, COMPLETELY disassembled it, and could not find a single indication of water damage, as I had known all along.  What I did find was a burnt out connector where the motherboard hit the power supply, which I also had known all along.  Sony sold me a shitty defective (though expensive) product, lied to me several times, tried to screw me out of money, and for all intents and purposes tried to steal my laptop (since they held it without contacting me and then attempted to send to an invalid address so it would be returned to them).  Now there's a lesson in customer retention!

Finally had a chance to try Iruña.  If you go through my old reviews, you'll see that Sol y Sombra was my absolute most favorite restaurant in the Valley until it abruptly closed.  This made me muy triste.    Sol y Sombra 2 - aka Iruña - is just as good.  Most of my favorite dishes and cocktails made the leap from NoSco to OTS thankfully.  So did most of my favorite employees...and they remembered me!  The ONLY negative thing I can think of is that they got rid of my favorite dessert - the baked apple.  Eating it was like going down on an angel.  Put that back on the menu!

Food and alcohol deserve 4 stars - very standard classic spanish/basque tapas executed well, very creative and delicious specialty cocktails.  Ambiance and service deserve 0 stars - overly loud dining room, unnecessarily lazy staff and servers.  For the details -   Firstly, Jaleo messed up my reservation.  I originally had a res for a party of 6 people @ 6PM on Friday.  I called 3 days prior to change to 8 people @ 7 PM.  I didn't get a confirmation call the day-of which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were "an hour late" when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for 6 right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.  I also think it's ridiculous that they don't answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til 8PM on the east coast to call and make (and then change) reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they don't call you to confirm.  So, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words, "the kitchen is broken" and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that weren't available.  She didn't specifically mention which, of course.  We got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous G&T, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it (dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...)  Now, I'm a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order 6 of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldn't make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?  "Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu."  So...let me try again...what CAN you make?  Wound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the 8th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.  Also, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.    Thank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Fall-off-the-bone delicious.  Other mentionables - patatas bravas were potato chips which was a neat twist, and the romesco sauce had an interesting smokey flavor.  Otherwise, as I said, pretty standard stuff all executed well.

Never tried the food truck, but not impressed with the restaurant.  Bleu Mac had absolutely no bleu cheese flavor, might as well have been called "mac and cheese."  Date Me was way overly salty.  Popeye was way overly garlicy.  After we were seated by the hostess, the woman who I can only assume is the manager approached our table and seemed generally annoyed that our party of 4 showed up on time for our reservation and then requested to sit at an open table on the patio.  She said something to the effect of, "We weren't expecting you to sit here and now the kitchen is going to get all backed up."  Couldn't really understand why she even said anything to us at all.  Our waiter was nice and attentive though and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, so again not sure why the manager said anything, but she certainly set the tone for the meal...

Finally, a "reputable" taxi service!  The lack of livery oversight in this city has amazed me, until today I had never taken a cab where the fares were clearly posted, along with the drivers name and badge number.  Most of the cabs I've taken are totally unscrupulous, add phantom charges to the meter, take ridiculous routes to jack up prices, the whole bit.  I called Sunrise for a ride to the airport, the cab came in 10 minutes, the dispatcher called me in my apartment to let me know the cab was waiting outside.  Sure, the car itself was from 1982, but I love the old school charm, reminds me of my first car.  The driver was unbelievably nice and friendly.  Fares were clearly posted and the short ride to the airport was $10 and not the $15 or $20 I've somehow had charged to me from other companies.  I won't be using Discount Cab or any of the other dreadful cab companies ever again.
