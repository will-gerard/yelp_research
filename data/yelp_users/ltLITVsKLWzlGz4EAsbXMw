This is the best vape shop I've been to. Everyone has been friendly and helpful - they really go out of their way to make the customer happy. They were out of the nic level I vape and hooked me up with the larger bottle free of charge. The local art is fresh.  I'd like to add that I've noticed an extreme amount of patience with non-english speaking customers on several occasions (china smoking ban?). They will take care of you.  Try the banana nut bread.

Nice inventory and friendly staff.  Unlike most vape shops, you don't have access to picking flavors yourself. It's a pain asking to sample every flavor and I imagine the staff gets irritated by it as well. I do like that you get to sample on a dripper, but I can't imagine the current process is manageable on a busy day.  Suggestion: Leave tanks/bottles out like everywhere else. I would have spent more if this simple change was made.
