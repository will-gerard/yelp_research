Easy to find. The staff was friendly. They had all the necessary equipment on sight to do any exams/tests needed. Dr Hollenbach was great and explained every test and my results with me as we went through them. I would recommend Paradise Valley Eye Care to anyone!:)

I am at that age where glasses are now needed!:( Aki made everything a breeze. Eye exam, frames, lenses as well as taking the time to educate me on what the different lenses and frames were and how they affect me personally!:)

One of my favorite places. The location is great. The view is phenomenal. The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is subdued and relaxed.

The Ribeye w roasted corn and loaded mashed potatoes is one of TOMMYZ TOP FIVE steak meals!!! Make sure to have the Butter Cream Cake for desert. The setting is cool and intimate but they do need to update the interior a bit.

If you live in Phoenix Metro area, this is the only British Automotive shop to use!!! I have had several luxury vehicles. Currently my second Jaguar Vanden Plas. Greg and his staff are the best at what they do and put customer relations and customer service as priority number one. Prices are fair and they tend  to fix and check on minor issues without additional billing. I have referred others there that thank me for doing so!:)

SKY IS THE LIMIT!:)  The views are amazing. I recommend calling to confirm a booth or table along the windows to make sure you sit where you want. The food was good but it is expensive.

Terrible sound system. Interior needs sprucing up. Prices for events seem to be high especially consider poor quality of sound system. Doubt I would go back.

BUYER BEWARE!!!  http://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/fod/4373828582.html I set 2 separate appointments with Linda. Both times they cancelled last minute as I called them to find out where they were. Both times they stated traffic problems. Mind you my appointment times were 1030-11 and both times I had called the day before to confirm. Linda stated she was there 7 days a week 8am-8pm yet I had to call several times to get her to answer and never did she call me back.  The time they wasted was worth 10 times the amount of the service!!! I have filed complaint with BBB
