John was really nice about my off the menu request for just brisket and cheese - no bun!

I used to love this Ross. Now it is awful!!! The cashiers have two lines one purchase and one for returns and they don't know how to call from them. They used to say next purchase or next return and now it's a free for all and people starting complaining " I was here first". This is the 2nd bad experience I've had here. I will not be back and will tell everyone who will listen not to go there.

Never ever go to this location if you are looking for FAST food. I have been here twice now and have waited at least 4 mins for my fast food. Two and done - never again!!!

I love El Molino!! My favorite Mexican food place hands down! Family owned. I used to go there all the time when I worked in Old Town and I had not been there in probably 7 to 10 years and they still remembered me.
