We stop in Friday's every few weeks for Happy Hour. They have great beer and food specials during happy hour. Discounted drinks and half priced appetizers are a plus! The staff is always friendly and provides prompt service. This place is not super busy and the people are normally very laid back. It's not a very social environment.

If you like your non chain pizza restaurants then this is the place to go! This is your typical family owned place that servers awesome pizza and calzones. There calzones are huge and I always have left overs. The prices are excellent and they offer quite a few specials! Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed!

First time staying at Harrahs and the rooms were decent. Only problem we had was the noise factor!! We were on the 15th floor and could hear the live band out front all night long in our room! It was very hard to sleep!! Casino and dealers were great!

We were turned away and told they were booked and we need a reservation. They had at least 10 open tables and outside seating. Wouldn't even put us on a wait list.

I've been taking my dog to Dr. Lee for the past 2 years and he is a great vet. The staff is super friendly and very kind to the animals there. I always get a follow up call from the staff or Dr. Lee to find out how my dog is doing after a visit. They truly are a great group of people.

Horrible customer service. Everytime I call I get the run around. I finally cancelled my  cable service with them after having so many billing mistakes and getting the feeling that no one cared about my problems.

When this place first opened they had some really good Mexican food and service. New management came in and really changed the feel of this place, trying to make it more of a restaurant then fast food Mexican. Unfortunately this place has really gone down hill and their food isn't that great anymore. I have given them more then one chance thinking they maybe having a bad day, but each time I have gone back it's been worse. I wouldn't recommend it.

Went for lunch and really was not impressed. I had their lunch special which was salad and a small 8" pizza for 9 bucks. Not really a deal in my book. I had the Buffalo Chicken pizza (their special for the day) and the pizza crust tasted like cardboard. Their house salad was drowning in balsamic and oil. I could barely taste any of the great toppings on the salad.   The only reason I gave this place two stars was because the staff was friendly and prompt.

Time square is very small mom and pop type of restaurant! There is not a ton of seating inside but the food here is excellent! There always seems to be a wait at dinner time! They make a ton of unique dishes! If you like pasta, pasta seafood, and pizza this is your place! The pizza has excellent sauce and crust! Spaghetti and meat balls are delicious! Manicotti was scrumptious! Sandwiches are large and filling! I haven't found anything here I don't like here! They also carry a few unique beers that other restaurants don't carry!

I love coming to BJ's for their special brews of beer! They always have something unique on tap to drink! Beer is a little more expensive then your typical bar, but you are paying for a microbrew.  There food isnt half bad either! They have a large selection of food to choose from - Pizza, Pasta, Sandwiches, etc. There is something for everyone here!   If your going on a Friday night or Saturday night do the call ahead reservation right before you leave the house. It will save you 15-30min of waiting in line for a table.

I tried this place after receiving a coupon in the Norterra flyer. I wasn't disappointed. This place has really good pizza and salads! Service was very speedy and their food was excellent. We ended up splitting a salad and a pizza and still had food to take home! Sauce also servers wine and beer which really compliments the food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed with the food.

Great rec center! Indoor Basketball, walking track and small work out room! Basically all of the equipment your normal gym has just scaled down.  Very inexpensive for a year! $10 a year rec pass, and $50 to use the work out (weight room).   Site also offers a lot of classes for the kids and for the adults. Yoga, Senior Center, etc.

I love this Harkins. Its a newer Harkins and is very clean. The staff takes very good care of this place. The projectors and sounds are crisp and very good! It's by far better then the AMC down the street.   I love that Harkins does their souvenir cup and tee-shirt. Dollar refills for soda and free popcorn with the shirt! It makes going to the movies cheap again!

Where do I start! We had a wonderful evening here! Start your adventure by going to their website and signing up for their email club. You get coupons and notices about special events! AG is on the level of Flemmings and Mastro's, pricey and delicious!  1. Food - We were offered a free appetizer for signing on up on their email club! We tried the pretzel fondue! It was outstanding! The pretzels were soft and the fondue sauce was delicious! For our main course we tried the prime rib and New York strip steak. Both were cooked to perfection! Very juicy and tasty! Our server Ryan, suggested a berenice sauce to go with our steak and prime rib, it was worth every penny! I couldn't get enough of it! The sides are severed family style, with the free appetizer we didn't want to over due it and only ordered one side. The parmesan gnocchi was outstanding, very tender and flavorful. I think I could have eaten just that for dinner and been content!   2. Service - Our server Ryan was AWESOME! He took excellent care of us. He made excellent recommendations, was very prompt, and answered all of our questions. The manager came by twice to check on us as it was our first visit. Two thumbs up to the staff!  3. Tips - On the weekends, call ahead and make a reservation. They were quite busy. The restaurant can be noisy as it is very open, I would recommend sitting in a booth. They are open for lunch and run really good lunch specials!   5 stars! We will be back soon for sure! I am dieing to try the bacon wrapped filet and prosciutto asparagus!

Great place to grab a quick bite to eat! All pitas are made in front of you and they have a large selection of toppings! Everything from your normal olives, onions, green pepper, to hummus, ranch, bbq sauce, pineapple, sprouts.   Staff is always friendly and there pita's always taste great! Try the club or buffalo chicken, they are my favorites.

I have been to other Ah-so and have loved them, but i would not recommend this Ah-so. I've tried this place a few times now and have been disappointed every time. Sushi was horrible and very inconsistent. I have ordered multiple rolls on each occasion and each roll tasted funny or was poorly made. I could barely pick up the roll with out it falling apart. Service has been horrible. I won't be coming back to this Ah-so.

This place used to be the old waterworld and they have completely redone the place. I believe they have installed about 8 new slides/attractions and they are by far the best water park out there. Plan on spending all day at the park as you wont want to leave!   There can be long lines at certain times of the day, especially when school is out and all the kids are there! The food on site is decent, but not great. Some areas of the park have cement and it can be hot to walk on, may want to bring water socks to wear while at that park.

This is one of the newer life style Safeways! Very upscale feel with out the high cost! Store has organic products, cheese bar, pharmacy, full deli, full bakery, full meat and seafood counters, gelato bar, sandwich station, pizza Station, nut bar, very large wine department! This place has it all!   I shop here all the time and this store has some of the most friendly employees! Always willing to sample products and they give great advise!   If you get a chance, try the Pizza, Sandwiches or Gelato bar! The food is really great and much better then a fast food restaurant!

This is my second review for Mellow Mushroom - All I can say is that I love this place! As you can see, I am here all the time! The beer selection is fantastic and they continue to bring in new and unique beers that you can't find any where else! The staff is by far the best in the north valley! The servers, bartendars,  and management - all get a Thumbs up!   My suggestions for this place -  1. Sit at the bar and meet the locals, you will meet a lot of unique people! 2. While at the bar, talk with the bartendars, they understand and know the beers on tap and can make great recommendations! Dont forget to join the beer club!!! 3. The pizza is fantastic and made from scratch, it will take a little time to cook, be patient, its worth the wait.  4. Come for happy hour! The appetizers and beer are half off and amazing! Try the meatballs! One of my favorites!
