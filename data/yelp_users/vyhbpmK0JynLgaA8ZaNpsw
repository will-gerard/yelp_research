This place is great- they are quick but do an amazing job!  All if the techs are solid so you can really have anyone and still be guaranteed an amazing job!

Delicious Caesar salad- I have even started eating the kale Caesar, which is amazing! They are really good about asking about food allergies, which is nice for my gluten free friends.

This place is awesome! Start with the three amigos and a margarita on the rocks! Good stuff! The tacos are two tortillas melted together with cheese- yum! Definitely recommend for large groups if you want a fun happy hour spot.

This place is just not good.  I have tried it twice and both times have been disappointed with the fact that they cannot do even the most basic foods well.

The food was not good.  The owner sat at the bar and badgered the employees and customers. I ordered the stuffed mushroom and they were mushy and flavorless.   The "homemade" gnocchi was brutal.  I think they may have frozen it and recooked it.  I am not sure how they are still open.

The buffalo chicken pizza is delicious! Add in some pretzels with nacho cheese and a cold beer- yum!

Cold beer!!  I do not like the open patio with all the smoking but that is a personal preference.  I enjoy the atmosphere!

Straightforward and easy to use.  The circuit is perfect for a quick workout.  Lots of cardio machines and a large free weight area.  It is an unpretentious gym and i love it!

Go with one of the specials everytime! The chef here is amazing! Just had the bruschetta chicken pasta and it was so good! The chicken was moist, the tomatoes and fresh basil with mozzarella cheese tasted so fresh and delicious.
