After speaking with Dr. Brian Farquhar, I am no longer interested in doing any kind of business with Sears and their sister companies. I sure do hope this is his independent practice because that would make it easier for me to understand his rude and snarky behavior. My spouse called prior to me to reschedule our appointment for the afternoon and was told we would have to pay $100 to be seen. My husband told me this information and stated Dr. Brian Farquhar was rude and unprofessional, so I called thinking maybe there was some kind of misunderstanding. When I called I didn't hear the man say his name and asked who I was speaking with since I was taking notes of the call, he starts with "Well you called me, who are you", so I told him my name and asked am I speaking with someone at Sears because the way he was talking to me was like I called his personal number and I interrupted his afternoon nap or something. It indeed was Sears to my surprise! So then I ask are you the receptionist or the doctor, thinking that may help me understand why he is treating a patient this way (even though there is no reason to). It was the doctor himself! There was no misunderstanding, he is definitely a person you do not want to meet. His first impression on me is clearly negative and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He also said "unless there is a good reason you have to reschedule you will have to pay $100 at this office to be seen." I told him my spouse is at work and I got called in to work last minute. He said "I am trying to work too and you cancelled." At this point I am done with this boy, my reason for rescheduling was not good enough for him. You never know who you are entertaining. I'll never give Sears my business after this experience and I'll be sure to spread the word.

Sooo yummy, a little high in price but it's worth it. The food is always fresh & fast. The decor makes me feel like I'm not in AZ anymore :)

REVIEW FROM 2013  My first 6 months here were horrible. My first week here my toilet was clogged and I immediately contacted the 24 hour maintenance. Luckily I'm in a 2x2 because it took them a week to even come by and look at it. I had stains on my carpet at move-in that didn't get taken care of until 9 months into the lease. The student discount is ok...5% off. There's not really a bug problem if you get your place sprayed twice a month which they offer free of charge. On one occasion the guy did enter the unit when I put on the request that they were not permitted, I was in the bathroom less than5 minutes and I came out to find a note saying they just sprayed. The hot tub never works and the pool is nice. The 24 hour gym is awesome except only one door worked and the other one's keyhole was jammed. At this time I was already looking for somewhere else to go once my lease was up. Then they switched from Heers Management to Weidner and everything was made new. The property looks great, the maintenance could be better, but they're better than before. Sometimes they do not finish a job and I have to put in a work order again to get it done. There are weekly polls on Facebook to win $5 gift cards to Starbucks and the community events are cool.

**UPDATE 06/01/2014**  I've lived here since June 2012. I'm leaving because the rent went up again, they decreased my student discount, and increased the utilities. Pala Mesa isn't worth it. There's no club house, theater, dog park, basketball court, tennis court, water dispenser, the amenities are basic, nothing extravagant so I'm not sure why they're increasing the price. There haven't been any changes/upgrades with appliances or carpeting in the units just the community cosmetics. There's nothing new here that makes me want to stay and pay more. I have noticed new light covers for the entrance way, but it's looked like this for about 2-3 months and they're still not finished. When I didn't have a light for my apartment entrance they replaced it with the original style, not the new one. The lighting for the community is inconsistent, they told me there's an electrical problem and that it was put on hold at some point but the electrician was going to get it taken care of. The lights were fixed for about a week.  The SMS notifications always change. I'm enrolled in rent reminders, movie reminders, package reminders, everything and then I log in to my account and none of its available anymore. It's happened several times. The very least they'll have is a rent reminder but I don't even get that as a text message, just email.  They don't have a drop box for rent anymore which has really affected me since my work schedule is inconsistent. The office is closed at 6 so that forces me to go to the bank, deposit my check, wait for the funds to become available in 2 days, and then finally pay my rent. I paid my rent online on the 3rd early in the morning let's say 3am and got a late fee that same day but not until later that morning when the office was open so I'm pretty sure they apply it to the account, it's not automatic. I know when the drop box was there I could just drop off my rent and not get a late fee because the office wasn't open yet. FYI they don't take Visa credit cards! That was another headache. They take MasterCard and Discover, the convenience fee is $29.19. They also take cash/MoneyGram, $3.99 convenience fee. Electronic check is free.  I took a look at a model and noticed the countertops don't look the same in the units. Maintenance is inconsistent. My window wouldn't stay open so I had to put in a work order twice until anything was done. I basically got a temporary fix since the part needed isn't available anymore and of course they're not going to fix it until absolutely necessary. He gave me a window lock (I haven't seen these around in years! http://www.amazon.com/Jed-Mart-2-pc-SlidingWindow/dp/B006KM2KDC/ref=lp_517830_1_4?s=hardware&ie=UTF8&qid=1401663822&sr=1-4)  I am not sure how often the gym is cleaned but it seems every time I go, there aren't any sanitizing wipes for the equipment, the floors are DIRTY, and the bathrooms aren't kept up and restocked. Just the other day I was at the gym and the restroom was flooded! The locks don't always work on the doors for some reason and they were just replaced. I would just hope someone was at the gym already just in case I couldn't get in since I usually go at night.  Yes there is a problem with scorpions in this community. I HATE IT! I love that they have pest control though. There is also a problem with spiders. Cob webs everywhere, especially on my entryway light that I share with my neighbor. They clean it like once every 6 months, but I think they cleaned it recently because I just got a new neighbor.  The pool area is nice when it's clean. I was told by an employee they only clean it if there are 2 of them in the office. The hot tub doesn't work a lot of times and the pool furniture should be updated. There is Wi-Fi by the pool, but its hit and miss, very weak. Also the gate doesn't always work either.  Don't bother calling 30 minutes prior to close, they will not answer. I am actually trying to call them to talk to someone for clarification for moving out, but I'll probably have to go to them personally.  Rachel, the last property manager, was very sweet, welcoming, and genuine. There was a Cuban maintenance man (I forgot his name) that was great at his job, I haven't seen him around but I suppose he quit. I haven't moved out yet but I gave my 30 day notice already. I'll update my review after I move out about the security deposit and walk through. I'm probably going to be moving to a Bridge Property Management community.  7/1/14  Walk through was ok. I wasted money on paint though. I bought the color paint the representative in the office told me I have on my walls. Touched up the paint myself. Stacy told me when I signed my move out papers that I could just buy the paint and give it to them and not get charged for touch up. That story changed during the walk through though.   Bottom line: Pala Mesa isn't worth it, Weidner isn't worth it & you don't want to deal with their inconsistency.

It was ok, just had the fish & chips though & hubby had salmon. Wait on a Sunday was about 20min then they asked if bar stools were ok, which it wasn't for our party of 5, so we waited an additional 40min. Wasn't worth the wait imo

My husband & I already regret moving here after 1 month. I moved during a transition period so communication is I very little. The day before move-in I called to make sure my lease was signed because we signed it electronically. I was told I wasn't approved because proof of income wasn't on file & neither was renters insurance (which I had emailed already). I was told by the previous representatives that I could bring proof on the day of move-in. I was lucky I was off work to fax in all of the paperwork. I wasn't able to just bring it by because I was living in Avondale 25 miles away. I also had to read and sign a different lease. We have 11 months left here hopefully we can stick it out  or we'll just have to break the lease.

One plus to this place was if you deny housekeeping you get a $15 credit to your room. It can't be the day you're checking in/out and you do have to call and let them know.  Did not like this hotel at all. They charge for EVERYTHING. You would think coffee of all things, but no. There's a Keurig and next to that are 2 cups wrapped in plastic with the kcup inside I assume, $3.50. Water on the dresser was $4 I believe, seems free at first but read the note fully to not be fooled!   I had the upgraded room with a fridge and pillow top mattresses in the north tower. I'm not sure if it's renovated since this used to be a Hilton, but I'm not impressed. Paint looks terrible in the restroom, scuff marks on the walls, there's a knob missing on one of the drawers. What really got me was the water pressure in the shower though, just sorry.  With the required resort fee you have to pay you're able to connect one device to the wifi. I had my wii with me and was ready to watch some Netflix. It didn't work so I called tech support & didn't get anywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some kind of limit on how much capacity your device can have so you can connect to the wifi.   Wanted to go for a swim on a Saturday evening, pool closes at 8pm!! Plus this hotel isn't as close as i thought it was to the strip. It's a complete bore here! Where's the attraction like the hotels on the strip? Any who, customer service was great, but I've had better experiences at a Marriott and won't be back!

I like that the seating isn't too close to your neighbor and the high backs are nice, BUT in theater 14 the seats do not recline. It was terrible having to sit through a movie that you're enjoying but to not be comfortable at the same time. This is my second time at this AMC and I won't be back unless they update like the others.

Zero Star  I've given this car wash 2 chances at my business because they're 2 minutes from my home on Grove Pkwy. Each time my husband and I were ignored and not acknowledged so we left and we're definitely not looking back! I can't believe this is a Francis & Son's Car Wash

Very nice store & lots of variety, not far at all from where I live. I was helped immediately. I was in and out in 30 min w/ a bra fitting & it only took that long because I browsed a bit. I'm coming here from now on :) minus 1 star for prices. The 1 bra I purchased came out to $80

The food was ok. I came before when they had just opened and food was great, now they've gotten comfortable and lazy. The "Mexican food" you can tell had been sitting for a while, some trays were empty while others were cold. I stuck to the lo mein, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken the whole time because those seemed like the only things being replenished regularly. Getting ice cream is a pain when it's low. If I ever come back it'll be during the dinner rush when the food is fresh I'll assume. I did come about 5pm on a Wednesday.

So I've been waiting for this place to open & it finally has :) about 2 weeks ago. The look is awesome & so are the people of Waxing the City. I loved my experience here!! My "cerologist" was Morgin & she took her time which I liked. I was as comfortable as I could be for a Brazilian lol she kept the conversation going and was very informative about their products, hair growth, waxing, etc. This was the least amount of pain I've ever had for a Brazilian. The owner is a great guy & knowledgable as well. I did tip w/ my card but they don't accept tips so he gave it back to me in cash. 50% off any service first visit  & of course I'll be back

Very good comfort food, I love the atmosphere & employees. It's small though and can be tight to get through other tables. There's a Coca Cola remix machine (I think that's what it's called) which is cool but there's only 1 so a line does form quickly.
