Aghh..good ol College days at ASU West..Pullano's really helped with those 3 hour longg classes...I mean..how can you beat free pizza and dollar PBR's? This place is amazing to get a good pre class buzz on..but dont get your hopes up cuz unfortunately the monotonic instructor will eventually kill the buzz

Jojo's has been stepping up their game lately...I figured with them u just have to be detailed ...I always get a large well done cheese with 20  sloppy wings ...well done and sloppy are key words here...also their customer service is pretty good.

Rays is one of the best pizza joints around...but what is not cool is them charging me for ranch...and I pretty much own stock in the company..that's how often I'm there...but nonetheless ..good greasy pizza!

Cool atmosphere..but make sure you pack your lunch before you go there cuz the food sucks. Kinda pricey too.

It's a pretty chill atmosphere...great beer selections. However go when its happy hour.  Drunks and appetizers are half off.  Also. Try the white pizza..its delish

Aghhh...BW in Norterra....this is exciting stuff!! I live right by here so no more driving all the way to scottsdale...cool servers..best boneless wings...this is the place to be with your buddies during a fight, sport game or just to sit down and shoot the shit.

Pizza is delicious!! Cheese is top notch and pizza crispy! They also have good beers and prices are very competitive.  Icing on the cake is Leo though...super nice guy and always accommodating! Definitely recommend this place
