Andrew the owner of the shop is a typical salesman; he tries to sell you things that you don't need. I went in for an oil change and came back with a list of problems about $3000's long, which I know wasn't the case. For one I was told I need new brakes and mine have a month left, even though I know that's not true cause I just replaced the pads myself months before. I was returned the car with grease marks on my seats and carpet from them doing an inspection on the battery (located under drivers seat). And had to ask if they don't mind cleaning it. Among that a trim piece was now missing and I was told it was never there even though I bought the car new and never had the battery changed before. Upon leaving the shop I notice the "service now" light flashed back on. I had clearly made a statement to Andrew to make sure the light was reset after completion of the oil change; they failed to do that. I returned to the shop and asked to have it reset and I was told "can you come back tomorrow, we are doing an update for our computer for your porsche" I asked him why it wasn't done three days ago when I made the appointment knowing I was brining it in. I will never take my car to get serviced there. I am very mechanically inclined but don't have the shop space to do my own work. But as most luxury car owners may appear; loaded and full of money, who know nothing about cars, I however am not your stereotypical luxury car owner. BEWARE, He is a scam artist!

This place was great. Our waitress, younger gal, was absolutely amazing. Would recommend this place! Customer service is definitely a great quality there.

Gabriel is the go to guy if you need a great locksmith. I called him on Friday morning to have my back sliding door looked at to get an exterior lock installed. I spoke with him on the phone and the soonest he could come to my house was later in the afternoon, which didnt fit into my schedule because I was going out of town. So I told him thanks and said I would look around cause I needed the lock fixed asap. Five min later he called me back and said he re arranged his schedule and that he could be over in 20 minutes. (which was awesome) He shows up on time and is ready to work. He looked over the door and said he could do it. So I asked him when he thinks he could get it done...he said, "right now". Needless to say he got the lock installed and was very friendly. Gabriel is a great businessman and it is obvious that the customer is his number one priority!
