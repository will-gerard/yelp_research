Love their tortillas. All around great Sonoran style eatery.  Best in this part of town.  Just wish they served cervazas!

Horrendous experience it was almost comical.   They had an untrained girl do my wax.  I knew she had no clue what she was doing as soon as I met her. I played along for a bit, until the pain and mess she was making was so unmanageable. Her technique was definitely "unique" and did not follow the standard way the other girls worked.  I made her leave the room, while I had hot wax all over me, to find someone else that actually knew what they were doing.  The girl that came in to rescue her completed my wax, while I laid there shaking and horrified.  Thank God she was there to help!   I left the establishment in tears. To top it off, the front desk associates tried to charge me extra for services I didn't ask for, and offered no solution or refund except for a hug. LOL! Really?! In addition, the inexperienced waxer tried to sell me product - DELUSIONAL!   Now, a few weeks later, the hack-job that the untrained Euro-Wax staffer did on me is apparent and still upsetting to me.  I will need to find a new solution, as I have lost trust in this place.   I would suggest ensuring you book an appointment with someone that has experience, as the girls here seem to come in-and-go so quickly.

Clean shop, well-trained staff. Understands the details. You get high quality here. May be a little bit more money than other places, but I don't cut corners when it comes to nail health. Every detail is taken into consideration here. I love the team at Pro Nails!! I always get compliments on my nails everywhere I go.

I've tried it all. As a red head growing up in Southern California, I've tried every kind of tanning option on the market. Bronze Bar is the best there is for value, color, health and availability. It's a win. I've been a customer that goes weekly since 2013 and will continue to go there for years to come!

This place is a gem. Brought a group of women for a Sunday brunch. My party was late and very demanding of allergen sensitivities. The staff was patient, helpful and pleasantly helped my girlfriends have an experience they were all glowing about afterward.   Not to mention. The food was outstanding.

This place is perfect for a quick-and-easy healthy meal.  Think fast-food for healthy eaters, and you will enjoy. I also enjoy the variety of fresh-brewed teas.   It took them a long while (like months) to get the kitchen organized, the expansion helped - and service has improved.  I still can't justify five stars, as the staff is overworked, and gets very impatient with you if you are unsure of your order or need help. It's also very loud inside, I suggest eating outside.   If you can get in, order fast, and don't try to chit chat, you will get a meal that's pretty tasty and healthy.  I haven't explored the menu.  I always stick with the bowls.   I am a fan, but keep in mind that I also know how to get in-and-out of there quickly.

As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted with friendly disposition. The two gentleman that I interacted with were so kind, patient and helpful. I'm a novice, and they helped me understand how to evaluate my purchase decisions, picked out some bikes for me to test ride, and walked me through the entire process. There was no need for me to look anywhere else. I left with the perfect bike and accessories for my needs, all while feeling confident I purchased from good, trustworthy folks. Looking forward to visiting them in the future !!

Jim is such a nice guy, and we had a fun time here. I can see how kids would enjoy this. It's something fun to do, and what a great escape from the heat come summer time! Thank you for being so kind, and good luck to you in all of your business ventures!
