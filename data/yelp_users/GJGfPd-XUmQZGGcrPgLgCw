Took my bike in for a tuneup and a new kickstand.   The guys are nice and made me feel welcome.   Prices are decent and I feel this is a good place to do business.

I live around the corner from this place and I have been several times over the past three years. The first time I was not all to impressed, but because of the distance to other places I have continued to venture over to Sylvia's.  I my opinion the service at Sylvia's seems to be decreasing every time I go.  Today the server forgot the appetizer, I found a rubber band in our salsa, we had to ask for drink refills after the drinks sat empty for 30 minutes, and they seemed to be all out of the mother's day dessert special at 6pm!!  BOOOO Sylvia's.  I think this might be the last time I have eaten at your establishment.

What a great experience.  A friend and I went in for dinner on 4/12. We ordered drinks, they came with no delay. Chips, food, water refills, "do you need anything?" We are good.  The service was outstanding. It seemed that all the people their cared about us having a good meal with no issues.   The food was good, drinks good... I'll be back.
