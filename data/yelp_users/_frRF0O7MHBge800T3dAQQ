I am a fan of this city, which is why I live here.  One star withheld because the solid waste service charges are too high.  See that?  The only thing holding Phoenix back from the coveted 5 stars is that my utilities are too high.  Suck that all other cities in which I have lived.  A lot of people complain about "Phoenix," but most of their complaints can be explained by the fact that they actually live in Gilbert or some other crazy suburban enclave.  You can't move to Queen Creek and then complain that there is no public transit.  You can't move to Mesa and complain there are too many Mormons.  A lot of people complain it's too hot.  If they all shut their stupid mouths, the sudden decrease in hot air would probably result in a significant cooling of the area.  The HoHoKam lived here without A/C, and they didn't complain (trust me, I've seen their cliff drawings-no complaining).  They also dug canals.  If a bunch of un-air conditioned natives can dig a miles of canals with sticks and rocks, you can't complain that it's too hot inside your Prius.   A lot of people complain there's no culture.  How you can ascertain this when you only leave your tract home in Avondale once a month is beyond me.  I regularly trip over culture while riding my bike to work (yeah, I trip over things while on a bike).  But finding culture may require you going somewhere other than Target or Walgreens.  So yeah, I'm a fan of Phoenix, but I'm not a fan of high solid waste service charges.  Nor am I a fan of a lot of people who live in the ubiquitous Valley.  But I like Phoenix a whole lot.  I'd even give it a reach around.

A few lessons learned after my trip to Giant.  Lesson #1 to business owners--take credit cards.  I don't carry cash.  If you don't take credit, then you lose my business.  I will never understand why a business would not want to accept all possible means of payment.  Lesson #2 to business owners--rather than turn me away for only having credit, it seems a better course would be to give me a free or reduced coffee (I did have a buck on me) on this visit.  This way you maintain goodwill, and I learn to have cash next time.  When Lola's credit machine went down, they gave me a free coffee.  You know what I did?  I went back many, many times.  I also paid them for that coffee they fronted me.  Lesson #3 to business owners--when you fail Lessons 1 and 2, people write negative reviews on yelp.  Granted, this single review will never overcome the current hipster hard-on for Giant.  But in 3 months there will be some new place for them to go.  Meanwhile, I will still be living and working within a short bike ride of you.  I also make and spend a lot of money.  Kudos to whoever designed the space.

Now that you take credit, you see me several times a week and receive a rating commensurate with my visits.  About damn time you learned how to take my money, which I for so long wanted to give.  Now if you were only open when I go to work at 6:30 am we could really have something going.  Who are your customers that are on their way to work at 7 or after?  Lazy people.  So now work on being open earlier.  To all the yelpers who called out those of us who complained about no credit--suck it.  Carrying cash is a big deal for those of us who are not day laborers, servers, strippers, or anyone else working in a cash trade.

Yet another restaurant following the tried and true formula for urban eateries--(1) pick a concept; (2) find a single syllable word that is an example of your concept (I think the proper name for this literary device is synecdoche); (3) open in Central Phx (preferably between the 7s); and (4) charge way too much money for whatever you are serving.  The concept here is fine, I guess.  I like toast as much as the next person.  But to feed my wife and me cost me about $30.  For toast and coffee.  I guess my sad little piece of toast had an even more sad and little piece of smoked salmon on it.  I also bought a pretzel to take to the Dbacks game later that afternoon.  I never imagined a pretzel could actually be worse than the bland styrofoam thing they call a pretzel at Chase Field.  Anyway, no thanks.  Hopefully the downtown allegiance of hipsters can tame their collective hard-on, find a new place, and Toast can become something worth eating.    I have no problem being price-raped by a local indie eatery, but they best come with their A game, or at the very least, a reach-around.
