I had a great experience buying an engagement ring here. The staff was very helpful and not pushy, rude or overwhelming. They had a large selection of rings and diamonds that were all top quality. The setting adjustment was done promptly and quickly available for pick up. All and all, I would recommend this Jewelery store to everyone.

Game night, this is the place to be. Green chili burger, medium gold wings and pitchers are my favorite. Lisa is great bartender too!

Allegiant Air= if you book a flight here prepare to be treated like cattle. Customer service is extremely poor. You wait forever. And ever. It's very inconvenient located on the edge of Mesa. The flight is inexpensive and you pretty much get what you pay for. I hope to never be subject to an allegiant experience again.   Posting this after hoping to have had a better time around than my last flight. Not the case, it was unbelievably worse.

Jeremy and CO are professional, knowledgeable and trust worthy landscapers. I received a good referral to them and Jeremy was able to give me a quick quote on 3 tree removals and a trim on a very large tree instantaneously. He was also able to start the work that day and completed it very quickly.  The work that was done was no small task and he made it look like a breeze. Everything was left clean and in place. I would use Cahill Landscaping in the future as the service was top notch.

Pros: Right next to Chase, they have beer.  Cons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location. I save my money for $1.50 dogs inside Chase.  my summary: I would give GAME 7 one star but the fact that it's close to the Field and they serve beer is the only thing saving them. BRING BACK SLIDER'S
