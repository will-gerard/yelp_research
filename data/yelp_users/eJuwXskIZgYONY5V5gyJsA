What a gem! I must have driven by this place a million times and never knew it was here. Thanks to a fellow yelper for introducing me!  The place is sexy and mysterious - you feel like you know something others don't simply by stumbling into Merc Bar.  Staff was so nice, drinks were delicious, and the Moscow Mules were a treat. I'll be back.

Embarrassment - every single time. This is a nice area... A really nice area, but the trash seems to flock to this Walmart from miles around. Fact: I've sent in so many pictures to peopleofwalmart.com from this location! Where in the h*ll do they come from and why here?! Today, I practically watched a ghetto women beat her children and scream at them bc she wanted to check herself out in a pair of walmart's hottest sunglasses and they kids wouldn't stop asking her questions. It was so bad that my daughter told me she was scared. Customers were staring, the employees did nothing. So embarrassing. The remodel is most likely going to look great when finished ... But by reading precious posts, I think the damage has been done for this location, and a shiny new facade can't change it's reputation as the "scary Walmart". Head to Desert Ridge and go to Target Greatland or Home Depot. At least you'll feel safe.

I'd give 5 stars if the waits were better. When a woman needs any kind of car service from a wash to maintenance, she cringes & would rather plot her own death than deal with the bs that will surely ensue. The guys at this location are great and make me rethink offing myself. Sure, things haven't always been perfect but overall, they're honest, sincere, & don't talk to me like I'm an idiot. I appreciate that. Tires are expensive and you get what you pay for with quality and longevity but these guys give great service regardless of how much you're spending. Glad this location is my neighborhood Discount Tire.

Really like this place! They know how to relate to kids. Always calling my daughter 'Princess' and speaking to her on her level. Like any dr's office, they can get behind from time-to-time so having the play area in the waiting room is really nice. The rooms themselves could probably use some updating but they are kid-friendly designs on the walls.  We've recently worked with Jennifer Valentine and she was amazing!

As far as airports go - this one is pretty damn good! Especially the main terminal with Southwest Airlines. There are so many great restaurants for an airport that showcase all types of food. The airport has a few halls that are museum-esque with their displays of Arizona artwork and photography. If you're ever lost or overwhelmed, just look for someone in a purple jacket and they'll happily get you the info or directions that you need! Oh - and a tip - if the line to get through security for your gate is too long, just go in another one. You'll have a bit of walking to do but they all connect and once inside you can take the moving sidewalks if you'd like. That way you're not stuck waiting to be xrayed.

This store is always clean. There is an adorable senior citizen that hands out samples in the produce section. He is so sweet and loves kids. The sushi is decent being that it's pre-made. Very convenient that there is a Starbucks inside the store. During football season you get discounts if you wear a Cardinals jersey on sundays.

Any previous reviews that had above a 2-star rating ... check the date. They're old. This place is quite pricey. The reason I went was because I saw a sign that they had a tailor on site. Well, yes, but ... the tailor is only there M-F until 5pm. So unless you can get off early or come on your lunch break (which I'm sure everyone is dying to do), you're not going to get you pants hemmed. And the tailor isn't in on weekends. Safety pins sound better at this point. Check out Sew Now Alterations at 4030 E Bell Rd instead. They're just a lot more flexible.

Eh ...   I'm struggling to find something I liked about this place and the only reason I'm not ripping it to shreds is bc I love their sister restaurant, Zipps. I'm trying to give them a chance.   I frequented Goldies on a Thurs during lunch and had terrible service. Our server was very nice but was clearly lying out her teeth every time she spoke. That was evident from the get-go. It was embarrassing. She didnt like the way my lemon looked in my water, and while I appreciate that and I appreciate her getting me a new one, I do not appreciate her doing it while at the table with her bare hands. She did tell me that she had just washed her hands, which she hadn't. I saw her in the bus station and I saw her roaming around the restaurant while waiting for our drinks. Ugh.  They don't have any lunch specials. Who doesnt have lunch specials? Food was SUPER late. It took more than 30 min to get our lunch and we had to ask about it. We were told by the server that they had to make sure our order was correct & that took some time. Really? We ordered a standard burger but wanted beef rather than turkey. Not too complicated. And if that is, you shouldnt be in business.   Manager never visited until after we got our food. He did offer up some coupons for next time to my friend. My order really wasn't that good but I dared not say anything bc I didnt have time to wait for a replacement. I would be dead by the time the new entree got to my table.   Very disappointed. I know I won't be back ... I'll stick with Zipp's.

I can honestly say that I hope I never come here again. But not because the service is bad! Given the nature of visits to funeral chapels, the staff was very accomodating and flexible. They worked so well with my family recently when we needed to utilize their services. We packed that place! People and flowers gallore ,... and they rolled with it.

Tried Deseo during Arizona Restaurant Week for the first time and was completely impressed. The Westin is already and awesome venue so when you walk downstairs into Deseo, you don't know what to expect. Their bar area has an amazing mojito bar. It's one of the first things you see and smell when you walk in. They have dishes and dishes of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs that they hand muddle into your drinks. even the virgin mojitos are wonderful.  Try Deseo - you won't be disappointed. It's classy and has sassy cuisine! Dress up - the venue is worth your great heels, ladies!

Lve!!!   The patio is awesome. Occassionally the wind blows and the Waterfront doesn't produce the best of smells ... but the ambiance on the patio more than makes up for it. The wine was amazing, the mediterranean flatbread was awesome, we tried some of the bruschettas that were great. I really love the vibe inside too. We were there on a Sat night and the DJ kicked it up a notch but was not overpowering at all.   I'll def be back!

Nice decor, lots of tvs in the bar, Lisa and Dani provide THE best service, and I love that they offer different entree choices for different seasons on the outsert of the menu. You can count on your favorites still being there while looking forward to trying something new.

The staff at this location are so nice! I really appreciate the fact that they're there when you need them but they don't hover. Unfortunately, as informed by the aforementioned staff, this is not considered a 'high traffic' store so they don't get all of the shoes or all of the sizes that their busier counterparts have. However - if there is a pair you like at another location, they can print you out a receipt for a few dollars off to compensate you for the gas you've spent getting to the other store, as long as you go within 24-hours. That's pretty cool!

No more unlimited steak fries unless you ask.   We had a large reservation for a Saturday evening. When we arrived, we were extremely disappointed to find that the manager couldn't seat us not only together, but on opposite sides of the restaurant to the point where we couldn't even see each other. He acted like we were inconveniencing him.   Having worked in the industry for years, I offered some suggestions of how we could make this work & he simply refused to listen. Well, now you can listen to my feet walk out the door ... Our parties were on opposite sides, our side was literally done eating before the other side even got their food. RIDICULOUS. Checks got messed up and mixed up. There were things on our tabs that NO ONE had ordered.   No mas, Red Robin.

The location is convenient for me and the prices are good, but that's about the extent of it. The employees always ask if they can help but honestly ... looking at their hair and nails, I'm not sure that I would feel comfortable asking for their assistance or opinions. I know that's an awful thing to say but is the truth. If I'm in a salon or beauty supply store - I want to know that the people use the products, have good hair, and resemble some sort of "beauty". Fried hair, penciled eyebrows, beauty-school dropout doesn't make me feel confident.   I've belonged to their club for several years and pay to renew every year but it seems that the one time I forget my card, WEIRD, ... they can't find me in the system. They can't find me by address or phone number. I promise, that information hasn't changed. I've talked with several friends that have said they've had the same experiences with different Sally stores.   It's really no wonder ... the place still uses dial-up. Good grief.

Food was ok ... I didnt think any part of it was special. We didn't take long to get seated. I asked for a menu as we had a kid with us that didn't want rolls or something from the happy hour menu. We never got one, despite the fact that the waitress tried to take our order twice and both times we asked for a menu. I finally grabbed one from the hostess. Then when the waitress saw I grabbed one, she made a shitty comment about how she needed a minute. Your other tables aren't my concern. I've asked twice. 3rd time, I'll get it.  The friends we were with raved about Sushi Brokers. It was alright. Calamari was chewy, rolls were good, teriyaki chicken was ok, miso was ok, service yuck. It didn't grab me. Maybe another time ...

SCRUMPTIOUS! Their summer deal of a pizza, appetizer, and two glasses of wine for $20 or $25 (I forget) was an awesome deal. Every pizza I've has been delicioso, the wine was great, the caprese was wonderful, and their caesar salad is fantastic. I'm a fan!   When the weather is nice, I love sitting on the patio and people watching. It's a great combo between a full-service restaurant and a fast-food place.

I recently attended this Classic Cooking for a pizza making class. Once the meal was finished, we were all able to sit down and eat the feast. From the time we walked in, we were greeted and offered a beverage (wine, beer, soda, water, etc). Refills were complimentary! Chef Swartz handed us all aprons, explained how it was going to work, and lead us back to the kitchen. As soon as we interacted with Chef Swartz, we knew it was going to be a fun evening.   Once in the kitchen, he gave us a demo on making the dough used for pizza and calzones. He answered all questions and gave us some tips that come frmo years of experience. There were so many "ah ha" moments that you could practically see everyone's epiphany lightbulbs going off! We didn't actually make the dough, instead, there were individual servings of dough pre-made for us so that we didn't need to concern ourselves with the time it takes to let the yeast rise, etc.   We all got practice kneading the dough and they even showed us how to properly "throw" a pizza over your head. The braves souls, aka myself, decided to try and IT WAS AWESOME! I've never felt cooler in a kitchen!   When our dough reached our desired shape for the pie or calzone, we added the sauce and toppings such as fire-roasted peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, ham, pepperoni, fresh mozzarella, pesto, and more. Chef Swartz and his assistants helped us to get them into the oven and they made sure to pull them out in time. We also made the most FABULOUS Caesar dressing I've ever had.   When the salad was made and the pizzas were cut - we were back in the dining area and sat down dine by candlelight. It was a really great night and I can't wait to do it again. At the end of the event you're also fed delicious dessert and given paper copies of the recipes created during the kitchen session. I hope to bring some family to Classic Cooking as something fun to do while they're visiting Arizona. It doesn't hurt that North Scottsdale is beautiful with gorgeous sunsets!   Oh - and p.s. Chef Swartz introduced me to a wonderful Spanish wine. YUM!

This place isn't fancy and you shouldn't expect it to be. But it is good. And the staff is nice. My girlfriend and I continue to return for lunch or dinner. We always get a half order of garlic knots, split a salad, and then some pizza and wings. It's a place that I can go and catch up with my friend and have a good meal without breaking the bank. I'll be back!  Oh and the seasonal pear salad knocked my socks off!

People bitch about the food but I don't think Lakeside is shooting for upscale cuisine on their menu. It's a bar that happens to serve food. What I do like is: - Dog friendly patio - Cool decor (the owner made the bar & the glider)  - Lots of regulars - Kid friendly  - Nice staff - In the area -- it's by far the best "bar"!! It has a great neighborhood feel, great patio, fun fun fun place to watch football, and good drink and food specials.

I feel weird writing such an awesome review for a fast-food joint but I love this location. I frequently order online or via the iPhone app. Today, I arrived 5-min early to pick up my order and they gave me a free large beverage while I waited. In the past, I arrived about 10-min late because I got stuck at work and they insisted on scrapping my order and making me a new one so that it would be fresh. AWESOME! Businesses don't do cool things like that when it is their fault, much less when it's the customer's fault. I'm hooked on Chipotle. If this location wants to round my bill up to the next nickel or whatever that controversy was - go right ahead!

Excited to try Brix and had a Groupon to do so. Several friends and I called at 12:30 because the Groupon said we needed a reservation. They assured no reservation was necessary for 6:30 pm. Got there early. They closed and they closed early. Sign on the door says they close at 7. I call shenanigans. Boo to Brix

Im incredibly surprised to read all of the poor reviews this location has received because I've experienced nothing of the sort. This location is one of their newest & is therefore not as busy as the rest. Because of that, I feel that I always receive prompt service and never wait for a table. Over my several visits I've gotten to know the staff a bit & they recognize us whenever we come in.  I love that they offer some "fancy" salads on their menu. In the summer, the summer berry salad is the bee's knees. The rest of the year the gorgonzola pear salad is delicious! Their lunch plates are good sized & reasonably priced. And they are nice enough to let me order off the lunch menu during dinner.  Beers are cold, dessert is good, wings are delicious (i ask for mine extra cruelt), they don't get all crazy if you ask for extra ranch, and the bread basket is great to nosh on while you wait for your meal.  Good place, family atmosphere, give it a try!

LOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)

Overall, I enjoyed myself at The Parlor. I sat in the bar and waited for a friend to join. My drinks were good, the spinach salad was amazing, but the staff ... eh, only so-so. And the reality is that no matter how good the food and how free the drinks flow, if you don't have a good staff representating your establishment, the whole experience is tainted.  It took forever for someone to greet me and give me a menu. Seriously, forever. And they were absolutely not busy. It was 8pm on a Monday. I ordered my drink and then when I was joined by my friend, again, it took time for them to be greeted.  When my wine was gone, no one asked if I wanted another - which I did. Instead, at about 9:20pm, someone just dropped off our check and went back behind the bar. I would have ordered another round but felt they didnt want us there. We paid & then left.  The ambience is really great and sticks with a lot of the restaurants in this part of town. I love the area. Maybe someday I'll try again.

Can I give this place a zero star rating? Came in with the kids to get kiddie pedis & my own pedi, as well as a fill for a friend. They said they could take us all and that it wasn't a problem. One of the pedis was for my friend's young son and we asked if he could soak his feet & that's it. Next thing I know, the women were getting ignored & they're giving him a full blown pedi. A five year old does not need calluses removed!!!! Despite the fact that we didn't ask for that and in no universe would he ever need that service, we were charged for it.  I also thought it to be an exceptional business strategy that they were trying to upsell add ons to the pedis for the girls. Since when does a 7-year old make payment decisions?!' They upsell you like crazy and don't take 'no' for an answer. At one point during my pedi, she was trying so hard to get me to do a manicure that she actually told me my hands looked terrible. They will look really terrible when I scratch your eyes out. Or maybe I'll scratch mine out if I ever decide to go to this salon again.

My God this place is scum. I think it attracts the scum of the scum. And it's definitely a "who you know" bar. People came in that obviously knew the bartender and they got great service and were acting like they owned the place. We had a large group with us and didn't get service at all.   Once we went & didn't realize it was rap night. Like - live rap night. Live, entry-level, rap night. We're a fun group and will try anything so we stuck it out for a bit but that was too much. The second time we tried, it was rock music but the clientele and lack of service made people so uncomfortable that we left.  The shuffleboard is fun!

Great time at this restaurant! Very crowded on a Friday night. We were luck to find a bar seat on the patio and got served quickly. The bartenders were busy as can be but still gave us just the right amount of attention.   We ordered the antipasti plate ... it was perfect!   I also tried my hand at the Bacon Bloody Mary ... I can't stop talking about it. HUGE FAN.

No one ever wants to take their animals to the vet or the hospital, but when you have to - you have to go here! They are great. When a worried pet parent calls to make the appointment, you're immediately greeted with a sympathetic voice. The staff and the vets are so great and constantly reassuring you that you're not a bad dog mom.   One of the BEST things about ARAH is that they will let you make payments without interest or pulling your credit. A lot of reasons people let their animals suffer is because they can't afford the treatment.   I have to English Bulldog babies and the staff here are well aware of their special needs and special things you need to be aware of. I can't thank them enough for taking care of my bullies.

What a hidden friggen gem! From the outside you have NO idea what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised. Around each corner is something new and exciting from the kareoke to the dance floor, to the boxing ring, to the food truck, and the store. Tons of fun!!! I can't wait to go back. My only complaint but also a compliment is that the drinks are pricey. Most likely because they're made with all organic fruits or veggies, etc. They're delicious - don't get me wrong! I tried their lemonade with vodka and also their bloody mary - YUMMMM! But they're pricey ($12+) and they take FOREVER to make. I sat at the bar for probably 20 min before I was even acknowledged. The bartender wasn't being rude, just really busy. I would have drank a lot more if it didn't take so long to get served. 4 stars for the ambiance & the cool vibe. 2 stars for the service.

My only beef with this place is that the little kids area - is well, for little kids. Like tiny ones. If your kids are between the ages of 5-7, odds are they will be bored quickly and really want to go play with the other kids. Now that I've griped about that... - Jump Street is awesome for the older kids. The staff does a great job of monitoring the trampolines for trips and falls. They're very attentive but they're not crazy either so the kids can still breathe and have a good time. I do wish there were more chairs for adults. From time-to-time you can catch a Groupon deal to save a little on admission prices. Def a good time for the kiddos.

I've only been here once but plan to be back!   I had the OMG and all I can say is OMG. That was probably one of the best sandwhiches I've ever had IN MY LIFE! If I wasn't there on a date, I would have made out with it. I'm not scared to admit that.   I also had a Mai Tai which was so good as well. Strong enough to be fun but not so strong so that you have to wait for the ice to melt. Maybe if I had a 3rd Mai Tai, I would have made out with the sandwhich.   Would be nice though if the staff frequented the patio and took your order. Was kind of a buzzkill to have to go back inside and wait in line to get another drink.

I LOVE THE PIZZA!   And the mediterranean salad is scrumptious, too! This location is better than some of the others. The tables aren't so close together that you can actually walk through this one. I know people love eating at Grimaldi's but the other locations are so small with so many tables and people crammed together that I'm sure to catch someone's cold because I'm in their personal space. I recommend this location! It's delicious and sanitary!

Hello heaven...   I love this place - the vibe is great, the decor is cool, the casette tape wall is radical, and they don't scoff at you if you ask to turn on a patio heater. The staff is prompt, my drink was never empty (wine ... oh, the wine!), and the fondue was delicious.   I can't wait to go back!   Until we meet again ...

Recently checked out my first comedian at Stand Up Live. It was a lot of fun and I really liked the venue. The fact the they serve food is great and having Copper Blues next door makes happy hour incredibly easy and convenient. Keeping your car in the same parking spot in downtown Phoenix is always a plus! Get there early - seating is first come, first served. Oh, and they validate so bring your parking ticket!

This place... Oh, this place. Kids have fun and that's what really matters...  The courses themselves were basically made by some handy man with some 2 x 4s, tape, outdoor carpeting, paint, and tons of black lights. It is thrown together cheaply and with little regard to the fun, trick shots that make mini golf fun. There are no windmills or anything else that putt putt is known for. Albeit there are one or two holes with a tunnel or loop... But they are so cheesy!   In addition to the course being pure cheese, the people running it aren't paying much attention. There is no delay in start times so everyone is holding on top of each other. The front desk should pay attention to that rather than just take people's money. And they're not even very good at doing that. I paid and had to ask for our balls and an adult club. The gentleman gave me the third degree because he didn't remember me paying a mere few seconds before. He was friendly, but the lights were on & no one was home, you know?   You also have various loitering of teenagers around the 9th hole. They were literally sitting on the course & the staff or their parents doesn't feel the need to make them move. Of course, the parents would have to be the ones to make them move because there were no other members of the staff anywhere to be found, except at the front desk.   Too bad my daughter won another free game on the prize hole at the end because I really don't want to ever come back.

I really like my wax technician (is that the appropriate term for them?), Andrea. She does a great job, is so friendly, and meticulous as all hell.  Front desk staff seem to be the same at any of these locations - young and not much customer service experience. Scanning the Ulta ad and talking about how your friend's make up looks awful behind their back doesn't make a good impression. Just an FYI.   They do crack me up bc every time I walk out of the room they ask how it was. Umm ... I got a Brazilian. You know what that's like.   The cool thing with this company is that when you prebook your next appt, even if you have to eventually cancel or change, you get points. The points can be redeemed for services or products. Bonus!

I tried - note: tried - to celebrate my birthday here. I had reservations and everything. Not once did anyone tell me my party had to be there all at once to be seated. The trouble is, & I told the person making my reservation, that I would be having approximately 40 people coming and going throughout the night so I can never say that my entire party would be there together. One manager tried to work with me, while the other manager came right behind him and undid the other guy's suggestions or solutions. It was my party and I cried, and not because I wanted to. It was awful.   They split up the tables that we waiting for me with my name on the signs and gave it to a 6 top. They said that the couple of us that had already arrived could share a 4-top table. Really? Awe thanks that was so generous. Then they actually suggested we hover over people in the outdoor seating areas and when they leave - we swoop their seats. Man! Why didn't I think of that? I love being rude and all up in people's personal space.   It was really unfortunate because I love Fox Restaurants but I have a very bitter taste in my mouth for this one ...   It's such a cool concept. Too bad they don't have their shit together.

I love the food here and I love the ambience and feel of the restaurant, ... when it's not packed. The location is too small. When it's busy, the place is crammed and it gets loud and hard to maneuver between tables. But I  guess that's a testament to how good the food really is.  The salads are so damn good. I honestly can't pick a favorite. I like to try a new pizza each time I go. Some of my favorites off the menu are the BLT and the Pear & Proscuitto. There are so many good ones!!!  People mention the prices in a lot of the reviews but you get what you pay for. I do wish they would have more coupons to the neighboring residents to encourage us to keep coming back or to thank us for our loyalty. Some of the ways to get a wee discount are to come during happy hour which is like 11-7. It's a large timeframe. The lunch menu is also really affordable. Some of their promos are date night Thursdays and 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays.  I'm a fan!

Sadly disappointed. After frequenting B Dubs in multiple cities and states, this was by far the worst. Appetizers came out w the entrees, forgotten sauces, missing meals ... Ugh. We ordered Strawberry Coronitas for our drinks and were told they were out of Coronitas so the beer was just poured in. Am I crazy to think that I'm getting less beer than I'm paying for this way?! I might be a lush but I'm a cost-conscious lush.   So ... The manager visited our table and tried to smooth things over, he didn't. He also forgot the sauce we have been waiting for ...   I guess we are still waiting for good service too ...  The end.

YUM YUM YUM!   I happen to have a sweet spot for salads that have fruit in them and Cafe Zupas offers me the motherload of choices to quench my fruit tooth.   Their lobsterbisque is so much better than I was expecting it to be. I was happily surprised.

I love shopping at this Target! It's always clean, the food court staff are always so friendly, and that damn dollar spot always has tons of stuff I don't need at great prices. I never spend a dollar.  Now that this store features a lot of grocery products I find myself shopping here more often. I prefer it over grocery stores and only shop at grocery stores because Target doesn't have a lot of meat, seafood, deli, or produce choices. Great store, great employees, ... Right on Target!
