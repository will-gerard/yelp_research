Since moving to AZ we have gone to T. Cooks several times and each time it has been a lovely and delicious experience.   It's my favorite place to go for brunch. It's pricey and it's not a huge Vegas style buffet but all items are high quality and delicious. Plus, you can order a la carte plus the buffet and the price is the same or just a bit higher than the buffet alone. I also enjoy the decor and ambiance.   We went for dinner last night and oh my!!! It was outstanding! I knew what I was going to order ( I have an obsession with looking at menus online before hand) but they surprised me with a Farm to Table menu from Chef Lee. The "theme" was pork,yum! And to make it even better, 3 courses for $40.   First course was pork belly with frisee greens and a poached egg. It was so goood!! A sprinkle of salt and pepper, crusty bread to scoop the egg and it was like breakfast :D  Second course, braised pork filled ravioli with bacon, squash, pearl onions. It also had a bit of cheese (Brie?) on top. I loved every single bite of it! It was amazing, the sweetness of the squash, the salty bacon, creamy Brie and the perfectly cooked ravioli bursting with the  braised pork was just heaven!   Third course, goat cheese cheesecake with apple compote and caramel sauce. I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts but the compote was on the side.  I never had goat cheese cheesecake before (surprising since goat cheese is one of my favorite foods:) and this was great, creamy, not as tart. A perfect ending!  There was a nice lounge singer at the bar, which we were able to listen to while eating in the restaurant. Now that the weather is nice, dining on the patio was very enjoyable.  I recommend T. Cooks without reservation. I'm already looking forward to my birthday brunch there!

Beautiful grounds, great rooms and the restaurant is excellent!!! It's our favorite place for brunch. The room we stayed at was great and the bed was so damn comfortable that  we woke up in the middle of the night to comment on how comfortable the bed was!!  The spa was OK, unfortunately my therapist kept talking and talking and talking and I was a wuss (yeah, I know...) and didn't told him to please just....shut up!  The pool area is tiny, so if you're interested in more of a pool scene, this is not the place.  4.5 but I'll round up because of the best bed ever!!

While I have not eaten at this particular NNY( I moved here from NY and is not that "native"...at all) it's 2 min away from where I live.Food is meh at the other ones though.  I just saw Devon review and I'm appalled and disgusted. If in fact it's  true, I will never visit this restaurant and will urge everyone I know to do the same as well. It is one thing to have different believes and a whole other to display such hatred and bigotry.  I appreciate this type of reviews, that way I can avoid places like this.

I go to BRU almost every week, sometimes twice, since  I had my baby 17 months ago!! It has pretty much everything I need and they open until 9, which is great. It's easier to go by myself than with him.   I must say that they use to have better promotions (20% coupons, now only 15%, better diaper coupons, etc), they tend to run out of stock of several products pretty often and it takes a while to re-stock., and sometimes is almost impossible to get an associate to help you in the furniture area. Then again, the store is literally 2 min  away from me, so can't beat the convenience.  I went to Buy Buy Baby and they do have more inventory (the store is huuuge!) and prices were basically the same. They accept Bed Bath & Beyond coupons here, I may have to visit more often, especially since now I'm expecting number 2 :-)

Great bagel shop. Good variety of bagels and pastries, delicious iced tea and their vanilla hazelnut coffee is my favorite!  The employees do a great job of keeping the line moving and getting your food quickly. No matter how busy they are, I've never spend more than 5 minutes in line, ordering and waiting for food.  Check you mailers for coupons!

I don't know if Los Taquitos qualifies as a "dive". It's more like a fast food joint for authentic Mexican food. I mean, is in Ahwatukee, in the middle of a suburb, between a Safeway and a Walgreen's. Maybe compared to other restaurants in the area it is a dive I guess.....It's just that to me, a dive is kind of sleazy, maybe not in the best part of town and you feel a little dirty when you get out of there, and that can be good or bad (depending on what good of a time you had) Anyway, went there to try it as is 5 minutes away from me. Like others mentioned, it's a small place. I went Saturday night, people were coming in and out picking their food and some were eating there. I was too hungry to do take out so I ate in. Ordered a chicken hard taco, pork soft taco and carne asada sopes. Food took a while, which surprised me as they weren't really busy, but it was probably because it's made to order. My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood!! Should have ordered more, my favorite was the sopes and carne asada. The salsas were flavorful and while I usually prefer red, I liked their green salsa better.  Service was prompt, the young women that worked that night were very nice.  I'm glad they're close to us, as we'll visit often.

Pretty good pizza, and I really like that it arrives piping hot!   I had it with anchovies ( not every one favorite topping:)and mushrooms or just with sausage. I have only tried the thin original crust, which is crispy and just a little chewy. Sauce is flavorful and the sausage was great quality. Is not cheap though, but worth it.Check your mail as they send out coupons from time to time.

Lately I've been going to eat to places that have 4-5 stars and everyone raves about them!! And just like when someone tells me that a movie is the best ever!!!!  my expectations are very high, I watch it and more often that not, I'm disappointed.   I'm glad to say that Capriotti's didn't disappointed me at all! I had a Capistrami and it was delicious! Also, it was the smaller size (9inches) and it was huge! Big enough to share, but being that I was very hungry and I don't like to save a sandwich with coleslaw for later....well, I ate it all!   I agree though with other reviews that mentioned the bread could be better. Luckily the great filling made up for the not as great bread.  Service was good and the guys behind the counter were very nice as well.  The price is fair since the sandwiches are huge.   I'll definitely come back to try other sandwiches.

I tried their pizza on different occasions, different toppings but.... I just don't like it. It's tasteless and somewhat expensive. I always have to add either Parmesan cheese or garlic salt or even just salt! I like my pizza to have more flavor, some spice and Florencia's pizza was not that good.

I can't believe I forgot to review Kai! We had our anniversary dinner here and it was lovely. I won't repeat what everyone said, food was delicious, service excellent.  My only negatives don't affect my rating: First, we were sitting next to a group of elderly diners that were rather loud and discussing the surgeries of their friends. Not something we were interested in hearing while dining. I was glad they left before us. Second, while the plates were beautiful I'm not a huge fan of "deconstructed" food presentation.   Expensive, but worth every penny.

After another visit to Wildflower, I decided they're way better than Paradise Bakery, which is only OK in my book and thus deserve 4 stars. As I get on Yelp to update my review, I see I have an email from the founder addressing my issues! That right there was great costumer service and will make me a loyal costumer. I'm hoping to try the breakfast soon, those pancakes are calling my name.   *3.5* I like it! Sandwiches are good, very tasty bread, salads are fresh and I enjoy the potato cream cheese soup. I've been to two locations and they get crazy busy around lunch time. While being busy is usually a sign of being good, I just don't enjoy ordering my food and then waiting around for a table, plus a couple of times I had the wrong food brought to me and it took a while to flag someone to correct it.

My husband and I call Z'tejas "old reliable". When I don't feel like cooking and/or we need to meet for lunch near our house and don't feel like thinking too much, old reliable it is.  We really enjoy the burgers, the chipotle mayo is tasty and the bread has a hint of sweetness. Unfortunately, there have been times were the bread was stale, not often but enough to remember. The shrimp tostadas, fish tacos and tortilla soup are very good as well. The Chambord margarita is delicious and I like the pomegranate-ginger  margarita martini drink, the ginger-sugar rim is very tasty.  I have eaten at different Z'tejas locations and they are pretty consistent.  Service is usually good, never had anything worse than waiting a bit longer for food or our bill.

This park is amazing!! Well kept, clean and lots of fun. My son is really into trains now. He wants to ride them,play, eat, bathe, sleep with them! The cost of the train ride and carousel is very reasonable and kids younger than 3 ride for free. There's a fairly big play area, stagecoach to explore, a small train museum and a water play area.  The eating options are lacking but you can pack food and have a nice picnic under the trees. We saw several birthday parties and one family reunion going on.  They also have free outdoor concerts but by that time my kids are exhausted:)

My husband and I stayed here for a little stay-cation 2 weeks ago. We had a suite and they upgraded us to one with a plunge pool! YAY! I really loved the hotel grounds, it was almost like a little town. Our suite was a little smaller than I expected and showing a little wear and tear but still very nice. We had a view of the mountains and the pool area. I really liked the outdoor area, there was even a telescope!  They charge for Internet service, which I was surprised since we've been to other 4-5 stars hotels were is free.Heck, we've been to 2 stars and it was free!   The pool area was well maintained and the staff prompt and courteous.   I was disappointed with the food offerings at the pool, room service and Crescent Moon:( It was uninspiring, the (old,I guess) menu on their website was much better. That being said, I ordered the house made s'mores and they were gooooood!!  I went to the spa and while the massage was amazing, their facilities are very basic and small. The waiting room was full and half the women were standing and the locker area is a bit cramped.  Staff was great and helpful,  they deserved 5 stars!

I wanted to order a cake for my son first birthday. I went to the store, as I like the cake designs on their website.  I didn't ordered right away but got four cupcakes to go: chocolate, vanilla , lemon and  red velvet .The lady told me those were basically same as the(some of the) cake flavors. I am sad to say they were: dry, very dry, so dry and super dry :(  And I went in the morning! After that I decided not to order from them.  Maybe it was a fluke but that's not good when you're trying to sell cakes:-s  My rating is based on the cakes/cupcakes.

I was performing my civic duty next door and didn't felt like walking too far so Sticklers it was for lunch. I wasn't too enthusiastic because I was expecting Sacks-like sandwiches. I ordered a BLT, chips and soda. When I took my first bite I was like whoa! This is not Sacks! The bread was wonderful! Crispy outside, chewy and warm inside. The filling was plenty and very tasty. I'll definitely return to Sticklers when I'm downtown and need a quick bite.

My husband and I went to Elements two weeks ago for date night. It was our second time, our first visit being over 3 years ago. We couldn't get a table then and ate at the bar, food was pretty good.  I made reservations, excited to have an adult night at such a beautiful setting.  We got there and the restaurant was 1/3 full.  The good-  Like I said, beautiful setting, nice and romantic. I had two drinks (while ridiculously expensive) they were very good. We had a great time talking and enjoying each other company. Mind you, we moved here from NYC so I know expensive drinks but $15.00? And I'm no lush but I didn't found them to be bigger than drinks at other bars.  The bad- Well, unfortunately everything else. Our waitress was nice but forgetful and absent minded. She offered to split our salad and didn't and forgot about our truffle mac & cheese order until we reminded her. The food- I was so heartbroken b/c we really enjoyed dining out and fine dining and it was such a let down. Our appetizers were average. My husband had the spinach casserole and I had the crab cake , which was the size of a half dollar. We then shared a salad which was OK but I think it's hard to mess up salad. And our entrees..... I had the monk fish wellington. The monk fish was luke warm and very bland and the vegetables too salty. My husband had the short ribs and again, bland.  We both love mac & cheese so we decided to wait for it. Our waitress came twice to tell us they were making it. When it came it was super hot but....it was crunchy!!! Some of it was al dente but mostly it was uncooked.   I was still waiting for something to be: wow, this is delicious so silly me ordered dessert, salt caramel panna cotta. Once again, disappointed. It was merely ok.  At least they didn't charged us the mac & cheese.   We decided not to complaint. My husband asked me if the food ruined my evening and thankfully it didn't, so we decided to just let it go. But let me tell you, that was one expensive "let it go".  Maybe it was just a night off, which worries me a bit considering that the restaurant was practically empty.

I have never stayed at the hotel, but I have gone to the spa several times and I LOVE IT!!    I've been to several spas in AZ and I think this is one of the best, if not the best. The facilities are great and you can truly make a day out of it. Love the changing/waiting area as well as the sauna, women pool and outside patio. The food at the spa restaurant is very good.  I had gotten the massages and the loofah treatment's....You have to try the loofah treatment!!! Your skin comes out softer than a baby's butt, plus is very relaxing. The warm shower and the lotion afterwards, heaven I'm telling you.  To make it even better, the prices are  reasonable, which is a very welcome surprise.

I hate scorpions. Hate them. But I live in AZ so I'm bound to encounter the evil creatures, however more than 15 inside my house were 15 too many. I have 3 young children and I was terrified for them. I had another company (Ky-Ko) come to seal our house and I won't bore you with the details but in short:  They didn't sealed every thing as detailed in their 25 point check list , incredibly poor work on what they actually sealed plus cheap materials and bad customer service. Excuses and more excuses.  Not wanting to deal with them anymore and desperate I called SOS. They came today and I'm so impressed. They sealed my doors perfectly, they resealed my vents  (previously sealed with duct tape! Really?!), sealed every nook and cranny,  they even changed light bulbs for me!  They were extremely professional and knowledgeable about anything scorpions. Mike, Bill, Mike, Kyle and I forgot the other guy's name (sorry) were all a pleasure to have in my house.   They recommend pest control spraying regimens, either a company or if you want to DIY.  They may be a little more expensive than other companies but they are worth every single penny and more.  I can sleep better now.

My husband and I went to Deseo for date night. Really nice decor, lovely Cuban painter at the entrance. It didn't felt like we were in Arizona.  I ordered a great Mojito, not made with that fake flavored rum and syrup.  The ceviche appetizer was incredible, as well as the empanadas and our entrees. We ordered the crab fried rice which  was good, with big chunks of crab, but salty.   Our waitress, while nice, was in lala land. Absent minded, didn't seemed to know the menu and forgetful at times.  *Our visit was prior to them closing for vacation*

It hits the spot every single time. I love that I can always expect my food to be hot. Menu is simple and  there's a secret not so secret menu, which is not complicated just not on the board.  Is a must for all of my East Coast friends to go to In-N-Out when they visit. Usually when they step out of the plane:)

CK's is in our neighborhood and we have gone several times. It's pretty spacious, even when is full it doesn't  feels crowded. They have TV's everywhere. The patrons ranges from bikers to families to rabid sports fans.  The food is your typical sports bar food. The fries are pretty good, I've had wings, burgers, and they're OK. I don't know why, but my wings usually barely have any sauce on them. I'm sure though that I could have asked for extra sauce no problem.  The service has always been great, friendly and fast.  All in all I'll give them 3 stars for food and 5 for service.

We first ate at Roy's at their Kauai location. I'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean.   Service is always good, food for the most part has been delicious, save a couple times were a new entree or appetizer didn't lived up to the waiter/waitress hype.  The drinks are very good, perfect blend of alcohol and mixers. I am not a wine connoisseur but the times I ordered wine by the glass I have been more than happy with my selection.  Overall, good food and service.

I would say 3.5 stars, but service was prompt and attentive so I'll round it up to 4.  Rolls were huge and cheaper than other places. Fish was fresh, spicy tuna was soooo good. I've been twice and there was something "off" to me, the second time I realized it was the sushi rice. Its bland tasting to me.  I want to go back to try the curry dishes.

I absolutely love Trader Joe's!! Such a tiny store with so much to offer! Granted, I couldn't make all my grocery shopping here but I definitely buy many of the items on my list.  Their produce is pretty good, they have a Brioche bread loaf that is amazing for French toast, the pies, cookies and scones are delicious, wine selection is good, beautiful flowers. One of my favorite products are they frozen meals. The Gorgonzola gnocchi is fantastic!!!!   The staff is courteous and helpful, if there's something you want to taste, they'll open it for you. That's how I found my chocolate and sea salt covered almonds addiction:)  While they can get very busy at times, I never had a long wait at the registers.   Now, I do have one problem. I have bought some of the sliced cheeses and while the expiration date is months away, they get moldy a week after opening them. That never happened to me before when  buying cheese from other stores. Another time I bought cheese curds and they were already moldy! I know I could have returned them, but  didn't had the time.   I love the store too much to take even half a star from them, so I'll just buy cheese somewhere else.

I have a love-hate relationship with coffee. I love the smell, coffee ice cream is delicious but I don't necessarily enjoy drinking it. Many times, I just do it for the caffeine. And I refuse to get a hyper flavored concoction that have 3,758 calories. I like to eat my calories, not drink them thankyouverymuch.  Since it's hotter than the 6th circle of hell, I decided for iced coffee. I always pass d'lish on my way to work and decided to finally try it. The interior is tiny, it feels like a cool doll house to me. I had an iced coffee and wow!!!!!! It was amazingly good. I tried another day ( and another and another) to make sure it wasn't a fluke and I'm glad to say it wasn't. My iced coffee has been equally great every single time. I also had a bialy with cream cheese and it was very tasty. I'm looking forward to try their hot coffee once is not  115* out.

We like Firebirds. Service has always been great, and food is very good and reasonably priced. The bread they bring before your meal is delicious, especially when is hot from the oven.  I had tried the quesadillas, buffalo meatloaf, sirloin steak, and a pasta dish. The pasta was nothing to write home about.  My 1 1/2 yr old loved the mac & cheese, a definitely more upscale version than Kraft, made with penne and a white cheese sauce. I recently had the shrimp, strawberry and goat cheese salad and I really enjoyed it. The shrimp were a tad too salty, but over all it was very good. I loved the jicama and spicy pecans, it added a nice sweet crunch.   I must say that during one of our visits I was going to order the peppercorn crusted steak and the server was honest enough to tell me: Unless you reaaaaaally like pepper, you should order something else. I appreciated his honesty, because I was not interested in having steak with my peppercorns:) and I like (actually expect) my waiter to steer me in the right direction if I'm going to order something less than appetizing.

I was wondering where could I get soft serve ice cream and remembered  Golden Spoon while being yogurt, most of the flavors are non tart,  and Golden Spoon is even better ( health wise definitely)! Less calories, many delicious flavors at a reasonable price. I wish they had more fresh fruit. I'm more of a fan of tart yogurt and their plain is not that good, but the pomegranate blueberry was really good, especially with cheesecake bites. When I'm in the mood for non tart frozen yogurt, Golden Spoon is the place to go!

We were in Glendale for a friend son's football game and it was lunchtime, so my husband asked me to check out Yelp for restaurants near us.  I really love the iPhone app, I sorted my bookmarks and Pappadeux was the closest.  My husband ordered a chicken pasta dish (not in the mood for seafood), our friend a Cajun combo plate and for me the fried crawfish/etoufee.  Everyone enjoyed their food, our friends really liked the dirty rice. My dish was absolutely delicious, the etoufee sauce was smoky/spicy and very flavorful and I as well loved the dirty rice The fried crawfish was ok, nothing special. The loaf of bread before dinner was warm and crispy, very good. The kids menu didn't had much for my 17 mo/old son,most  everything was fried  (he doesn't  like fried food much...I know, he didn't got that from me;) but he filled up on bread and the crackers they had at the table. The waiter was very nice and prompt, although it took a while for our food to come out.  We have friends from New Orleans who are great cooks and they enjoyed the food here as well.  I'll definitely will come back for the dirty rice and crawfish etoufee.

This past Saturday was my second visit to Roka Akor, first time with my husband, second with my sister. Both times we had exceptional service and food.   First time we had the tasting menu and while I don't remember much of what we ate (it was a lot!), I do remember everything was delicious.  My sister is visiting and she loves sushi so I knew she had to try Roka. We ordered the scallops appetizer, a salmon roll, unagi roll, sweet corn, mushrooms, BBQ crispy rice, teriyaki chicken and black cod. Everything was absolutely amazing! The flavors, the presentation, the aroma. The salmon roll was ridiculously good, a nice piece of salmon atop the roll, fresh and melting in your mouth. We barely even talked while eating because we wanted to enjoy the food:)  My sister doesn't like fish (only raw) and I had to keep her away from my black cod!   Oh! And the drinks are amazing too! It is pricey but very much worth it

This is a small toy store located in a strip mall in Ahwatukee off the I-10 on Chandler Blvd. I've been there many times and never fail to find the perfect, unique gift I'm looking for. They have activities for the kids and caregivers like bilingual story time, art classes, magic classes etc. Today they had Sesame Street Day, kids could do art projects and take their picture with Elmo. Plus, they had sales throughout the year!    I'm constantly looking for Spanish books and toys for my son and while they don't have a huge variety at least they carry some.  Even though it's a small store it carries a pretty big variety of toys, so it can get overwhelming, but once you get use to it, it's pretty fun to browse. If you bring your little ones they have open toys for them to play with.   The staff is very nice and helpful and they'll wrap your gifts for free.

I have been here twice. Very nice and laid back. I tried the weekend Southern menu and it was delicious! Collard greens, mac&cheese, ribs, BBQ chicken sandwich. The scone with clotted cream was divine!!!! The iced teas are very refreshing and I swear I drank a whole container myself both visits.  The second time I had soup, salad and a sandwich. The salad had this amazing (raspberry? strawberry?, I forgot) vinaigrette. The sandwich was good, but I was kind of disappointed with the soup. It was potato and tasted too "milky".  They change the menu often and now have a tea inspired one. Can't wait to go back and try it. The owners are very nice and I hope they continue to do well.

Had a cheese steak with wiz and sweet/regular potatoes. The cheese steak was flavorful, not dry and very filling. I like that they have more condiments out (sweet peppers, banana peppers, jalapeños) so you can customize your sandwich as you wish. The fries were so so good!!! I'm not a huge sweet potato fries fan but these were not dry or mushy, just right with the perfect amount of salt.  Ohhh, and I had a cookie! Big and soft and yummy!

Great food, fresh crispy veggies, excellent service. I love the luau pork, but it's kind of salty, even for me considering I love salty food!  Mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood. I have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook it.I like it crispier (or as crispy as you can get tofu:)

Great park area!  It's always clean and very well kept. We celebrated my son first birthday at one of the pavilions and all the kids had a blast. I was lucky that someone cancelled, apparently the pavilions book months in advance.   The play area is completely covered, which is a necessity once  it starts getting hot.

A Mexican friend  of ours recommended Arriba's. We usually order take out, the 2 times I ate at the restaurant, service was poor and food was not as good.   Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day.  So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, I'll give them 4 stars

I'm incredibly impressed by the Children's Museum of Phoenix.  It definitely exceeded my expectations. We went with my 2 years old and 7 months old. He was in heaven!! He was all over the place trying to figure out what he liked more.  The Climber was not only fun but such an attractive structure. I enjoyed just looking at it. I really wanted to climb it but it was my turn watching the baby.  The tricycles with the little car wash was adorable, the supermarket area was a hit as everything was pretty real. There was a track with little cars he could have stayed playing with all day. The Noodle Forrest was a very interesting experience, and I was cracking up because my son didn't had any sense of direction:)   The staff was very courteous and nice. They answered our questions promptly and seemed happy to be working there.   We didn't even made it to the under 3 area or the art studio, but since we had so much fun and it's an ideal place to go with this crazy heat, we got a membership. I'm pretty sure we're going to be visiting every weekend.  I disagree that it's an unsafe place for kids, and to call the Climber a "death trap" is a bit much. I'm very hands on with my son, I just don't watch him play, I play with him and make sure he's OK and won't get hurt, plays OK with others, regardless of where we are.  If you have a kid that likes to run away from you ( like most kids do:) you have to keep an eye and close distance, especially with the stairs.   Any outside park will pose risks as well. I guess if you want it to be all soft and plush, might as well go to a Pump It Up kind of place.  I do however, agree that most of the museum it's probably not the most appropriate place for (some) 2 years old and under. I guess that's why they have the under 3 year old area then, but I can't review it as we didn't enjoyed it this visit.         I would say that my main negatives are the price. I do think that for kids it's reasonable to charge $9.00 but it should be 2 and up, with no charge or reduced charge for the youngest ones. Also, a reduced rate for parents, but I know many children's museums do charge everyone the same.    Truth be told, I had so much fun, I didn't mind paying;-)  We can't wait to take our visiting friends with kids! It's nice to have such an amazing place in Arizona.

What else can I say that hasn't been said already?    I'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!  My baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for "more " for the first time at the store:)  I do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order

Well, our initial plan was to go to Tuck Shop as I've been wanting to try it out. Unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table, the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin' and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later. There had sitting available right away at the bar but I'm pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question. They were very apologetic, which I thought was nice considering if wasn't their fault. I'm glad they're doing well. So I asked my husband if he wanted to try District and off we went. Actually, I made a reservation in case something happened and well, we ended up there.  Nice and spacious, not crowded at all.  They were part of AZ restaurant week and we ordered from that menu.  Shrimp sliders- I loved them! They should have a big version of it! Duck quesadilla- Very good as well, but I'm partial to anything with goat cheese.  We both got the country chicken steak and it was really good. Mine came 1 med, 1 small pieces instead of a big one. The med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt. The smaller one was perfect, juicy and crispy. The breading flavor was really good, slightly  spicy. The biscuits were awesome!! More of a cake-bread texture, light and fluffy and kind of sweet. Green beans were tasty as well.  Strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet ( I think it was a sorbet)- It was good, but not something I'll order again. The pie filling was too sweet, even the tartness of the sorbet couldn't help it.  Service was prompt, no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace.  Great dining experience and it made me forget about Tuck Shop. I still want to try it though.

I got my son 1st birthday cake and not only it was delicious, it was beautiful! It was made in the shape of a number 1. I brought one of the dessert plates that had the theme of his party and they added those details to the cake.  Everyone raved about the cake:)   The cupcakes are very good too. The only negative was that I got a brownie when I went to pick up the cake and it was hard as a brick.  I don't think that was intended, maybe an old one? Regardless, if you need a cake for any ocassion, please go to Sugarlips Cakery, you won't be dissapointed.

It was so so so bad:( Empanadas were hard as a rock and the filling tasted like bad Lipton soup, ugh. I got something else (maybe an ensaimada?) it was just so horrible I don't even remember.

We had a lovely dinner at BLT Steak for my birthday.  We sat outside as the weather is so much better, but towards the end we got a little chilly, and the chairs were not as comfortable.  The reason I can't give 5 stars is because inconsistency with service and food. The waiters were all over the place,  talking in whispers to each other, like they were confused. The restaurant was at about 2/3 capacity.  Our waiter was very nice, but it took a while before we got our water, which they apologized for. He did keep on top my husband's Coke refills.  The amuse bouche of pate and toasted bread was served to us before the water. It was good, nice texture and a hint of red wine I think. Like many people reviewed before me, the popovers are the size of soccer balls but light and melt in your mouth. Mine was kind of burned but still delicious.   I ordered from the black board menu, I had sweet potato gnocchi, NY strip, mac & cheese. The gnocchi was good, it came with sweet breads, which I don't care for much. The NY strip I ordered med well ( pregnant:-s) but it was more well done and more burned than charred. The mac & cheese was very good, creamy and melty. We also ordered potatoes au gratin which were amazing!!! I could have eaten a huge pan of just those. The sides are pretty small, can be barely share by two people . Considering the pate and popovers prior to the meal, I guess it works ok.  My husband had a spinach salad, nice size definitely enough for two. It was very good. He loves meat and splurged on the Kobe steak. Wow. Just wow. That steak sliced like butter and seriously melted in your mouth. Going back to my steak was kind of sad. For dessert I had PB & J brioche bread pudding....... Yum yum yum!  The thing is, it was served on a little pot and some parts were warm and others were cold?   So, it was not quite a 5 star restaurant experience yet still good. We will definitely return though, those popovers, potatoes, dessert and husband's Kobe steak are more than worth it.

Got 2 of their chicken chipotle tamales at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market. I should have listen to the guy and got more!!  They were delicious! The masa was fluffy not too dry or creamy and it had flavor to it. The filling was just right spicy and made with white meat, no fat.  Next week I'll get a dozen... Or two, who knows?

My first visit to the Ahwatukee farmers market was quite nice. It really can't compare with other farmers market I visited in the past as the other ones are massive. But it had a several booths to browse, with interesting, quality products.   There was produce, which in reality I didn't checked out. Cooking in my house has stopped until further notice as I don't have time! I got delicious tamales, tasty hummus, and a yummy crepe. I also tasted salsas, whipped flavored honeys, apple cider etc. Everything tasted very good, not artificial.  There even was home made dog treats!  Since it's a small farmers market, I don't think you could make a whole morning of it but it's still worth checking out.

I'm on a Mexican food kick, and realized besides Los Taquitos and Arribas there's also one of the 'Bertos close by. I told my husband where I was heading and he gave me a dubious look.... Right there I should have re-thinked my meal plan.  Ordered through drive thru, carne asada fries and three rolled tacos with cheese/guac. Food was ready fast. While driving home, the delicious smell I was expecting that usually makes me want to start eating in my car wasn't there. It smelled like grease, old grease. Got home and got a bite of taco.... Ugh no. It tasted like it have been fried a couple of times... several days ago. Then tried the carne asada fries....Meh, super salty.  I mean, I wasn't expecting healthy food, greasy food can be delicious but this was not, at all!!! I started feeling disgusted while trying to eat the fries and didn't even looked back at the tacos. Sadly, it all ended in the garbage and I hate to throw out food.  Maybe I should have ordered a burrito or had some drinks before coming here. I'll give them a try again, but in the very distant future when I can think about Bertos without feeling nauseous.

Came here with my husband for lunch. He had the burger and I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, both from the $6.99 lunch menu. I'm glad it was only $6.99, because unfortunately it wasn't that good.  My husband burger was just that,a regular burger. In n Out across the street have (way) better burgers. Now, my pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauce tasted mostly like vinegar and salt! The fries were very salty and if you know me you know I love salt.  At least the waiter refilled our drinks constantly.   We really liked 56 East and were sad when it closed. We finally got a chance to try Fired Up Grill but it didn't deliver.   The service was good, nothing to complain there.

Very excited to have a frozen yogurt so close to me! Zwirl is basically the same as Mojo, Yogurtini, Yo Yo: Self serve, weight your cup and pay. They had different flavors that change (don't know if daily, weekly?)   I had the taro and summer bliss. Loved the taro, creamy and it does taste like taro. Summer bliss was a nice citrusy tropical fruit mix, tart and refreshing. I tried the original tart but didn't like it as much.  Fruit toppings were fresh, I had strawberries:)  I hope they don't close so I can have fro yo easily accessible:)

I've been to this DD several times, drive through and in the store. Coffee is good and doughnuts have always been fresh. They don't have a big variety of doughnuts and they change them constantly. My favorites are the Munchkins aka doughnut holes. My logic is that I get to taste a doughnut without the calories of eating a whole one. Yeah, well, that only works if you don't eat the whole box.....  Service has been good, sometimes it even seems they have a lot of employees for such a small store. There's more people behind the counter than customers    Go figures.

Karey's was on my bookmarks and since I  got out of work earlier today I went for  lunch. It's a tiny but charming place. I'm glad I went later and was able to sit down. Karen and her husband were there. She's an incredibly sweet lady and sat down with me to talk about the restaurant and my recent trip to the Phillippines. I had the chicken adobo, chicken coconut curry with garlic rice and lumpia. The flavors were delicious, not too oily. My favorite was the chicken adobo, although it was a little dry. I think because it was chicken breast. The chicken coconut curry was good as well. The lumpia was delicious and their homemade hot sauce is great. Karen went as far as to give me a piece of cassava cake. Seriously, who does that?  I guess what I love the most is the feeling you're eating at a relative or friend's house. Was it the best Filipino food I ever had? Not really, but it was darn close!  I'll give it  4.5 stars but they deserve to be round up!

I've been to both locations, and I wonder if is fair to rate them together or should I do it separate?  The Phoenix location is way to small for me, I don't like feeling like I'm almost sitting on my fellow diners lap and, this is a huge pet peeve of mine, I HATE smelling like food! Which is inevitable because the place is tiny. On the other hand it does have charm to it and the food is delicious.  The Scottsdale location I can move, don't smell like food when I get out but is more sterile. And then there's the food....  I always ordered fried chicken (of course!) and the breast tends to be dry so I decided to do thigh and drumstick. Well, this last time  the dark meat was fried to a burn:(  And not only the skin but the meat too. I should have asked for two different pieces but I was starving, and my hunger won. A shame because I left without satisfying my craving for good fried chicken. The waffle was delicious as always and I ordered smothered potatoes which were very good. It seems with their mac & cheese  people either love it or don't. I'm on the 'don't' group. It tastes milky and not very cheesy to me. I may try it again, because I love mac & cheese and I have the hope that maybe it was just bad luck before?  Service is ok, sometimes better than others.  After careful consideration, I'll give it 4 stars. I'll visit again, I'm pretty sure, and then I may go up or down one star.

The fries! Oh the fries are so good!!!! Thin and salty and crispy and  I could have eaten my weight in them.  I had a California style steakburger. I think it's a California style because of the lettuce, tomato, onion and Thousand Island dressing? The burger is thin and had nice crispy edges. It was good.  I also had a chocolate custard. In all honesty I didn't got the difference between custard and ice cream. I guess that I'll need a more discerning palate. Regardless, it had a nice strong chocolate flavor. I would like to try the sundaes and "concretes" aka custard with mix-ins.   I'll probably give Freddy 3 stars but those fries deserve a star of their own.

*3.8*  I was craving a hot dog today and was near Ted's but remember I had bookmarked Lobby's and decided to try it. New, nice and simple interior. Not busy even though it was lunch time, I guess because it's a new place. Service was very good. I ordered a hot dog, fries and soda. I got my soda and my food was brought to me. The fries were very good, I would have liked them to be hotter though. My first impression when I saw my hot dog was what the..?!!! The relish was radioactive green! It looked fake. I am not familiar with Chicago style hot dogs, so I wonder if the relish is supposed to look that way? In any case, the relish was a tad too sweet for my taste. The hot dog was tasty and the bun was delicious!! Fluffy and fresh, could have eaten it even without the hot dog.  Being a new local place I wish them luck and will continue to visit to try other items. The burgers and beef sandwiches looked great.

OK, I don't know if just because one of the items on the menu is perfection, a restaurant deserves 5 stars. I've been back several times...err, weekly. I have a standing Tuesday "Hot dogs & Burgers" date with my 2 year old:) The burgers are outstanding! Juicy and flavorful. I always add bacon, cheese and giardinera (sp?) and it's so good! Lobby and his crew are very nice too. I may have to start doing our date bimonthly because my waist (and probably my arteries) are suffering!

Cool spot 2 minutes away from my house, intrigued to try it mostly because of the mixed reviews here.  Like most reviewers mentioned, the set up is not the best. Once you order you feel kind of lost, what with looking for your drinks, silverware, condiments, etc. Menu is minimal, they serve breakfast until 2 pm and lunch until 4 pm. After Feb 1st, they'll serve dinner as well.  I went at about 1:15 pm and there was a good amount of people. I imagine that during the weekends this place must be pack, especially since is not that big.    Although the set up could be better, I liked the decor, straight and simple. I like the green color, in fact, I didn't even noticed it until I left. They have a patio area that's not open yet.  I ordered the burger (medium) with Gruyere cheese and fries. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. The tomatoes even had a sprinkle of pepper. The only drawback was the bread. While very good, it was soggy from the burger and tomato juices. I don't like rock hard bread, but it seems this bun was to flimsy for the burger. The fries were hot, already seasoned with salt and pepper, I enjoyed them. A nice pickle on the side completed my meal. For dessert, I had a blondie cookie which was perfect. I noticed that the iced tea containers at the drink area were almost empty, not refilled while I was there.  I don't quite understand the "market" part, it was a few knick knacks, some olive oil, peanut butter and jelly, Meyer products. I guess I was expecting more.   All in all, a good experience. I hope they only get better. I plan to visit again to find out.

So we have tried breakfast and it is delicious! Except the bacon, it had a weird flavor to it, like old oil? I love bacon but didn't  finished mine.  I agree with most that the food is very good but the set up needs improvement. I'm very happy for them as the place is really popular, but can't understand why they haven't worked out the issues I and most people have mentioned on our reviews.  Also, being a family friendly/neighborhood place I was surprised they didn't had a changing table in the bathrooms. It's not that there's no space. At least in the women bathrooms there's plenty. I've been there for lunch and breakfast several times and there's always many families with babies and toddlers.   *3.7 stars*

I tried a Nutella banana crepe at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!! The crepe was perfect, not too flimsy or chewy. Also, I liked that they give it to you in some sort of flat paper cone, so it's easy to walk around and eat:)  I got  a crust less lemon tart that was delicious as well. I took only  two bites as my almost two year old ate most of it!

We women all know how important, no, crucial! is to have a good stylist. Like finding a good man, this can be difficult. Lucky me I found Saskia. She is the owner and only stylist at her suite. Very nicely decorated and cozy, as soon as I sit down my stress level starts going down.   She's has gorgeous hair (which I think is important on a hair stylist, I mean if they can't do their own hair......) and is as beautiful outside as she's inside. But lets get down to business. She knows her craft.  I  love my highlights and the way she does them I'm no slave to going every 6-8 weeks. Recently she took a course on curly hair and the haircut she gave me was great!  Saskia listens to you and if she thinks another style/color/cut will be better she gently lets you know, not being pushy at all. Her main concern is that you are happy with the way you look. While I never had to go back because I wasn't satisfied I'm 100% sure she wouldn't have a problem (like it should be, then again not every stylist is like that)   But the best part? She continues to learn new techniques and she's incredibly enthusiastic about learning more and getting to be even better!  I'm glad I know her now, cause when she gets to be famous is going to be impossible to get an appointment! ;-)

They got me at Red Velvet frozen yogurt! It's crazy good!!! The tart flavor was good but I got to admit I still like Pinkberry's better.  They also have Tammy Coe's goodies, but considering I'm trying to eat better, I have to work hard to ignore them and concentrate myself on the yogurt. Luckily, with flavors like Red Velvet, it's not too hard to do. There are other frozen yogurt places near Zoyo. I like it much better than Golden Spoon, which lately have a very weird aftertaste on it sweet flavors.   I met one of the owners and he was very nice!  I would like to see other toppings like mochi and cheesecake bites.   They have a frequent costumer card that I'm sure I won't have trouble filling.

The cause and organization deserve 5 stars but the race itself was a little chaotic. I think the course it's not fit for 30,000 people. I'm not a fast runner but it was a serious annoyance to have walkers and people with strollers in the earliest corrals. They were supposed to be at the last one.  While I love the congenial and family atmosphere, what bothers me is that they put others at risk. If you you're walking, keep to the sides, and for Pete's sake if you're walking with a stroller, don't stop suddenly!! I almost fell over a woman that did this at one of the narrow turns.   All in all, it was a good experience, but I think next year I'm donating and but not running.

I saw the freeway ad about the aquarium a while back and decided to check it out with my two year old today. I waited to avoid the crowds and I'm glad I did as the place is Small. Also, we got in as soon as they opened.  I didn't had my stroller, but  can see how when it's crowded it must be a pain to use.  First, it's overpriced. $18.50 adults, $10.50 kids. I wouldn't mind (as much) if it was at least a whole day experience but you're in and out in one hour! I'm glad at least I didn't had to pay for my son.  Inside is Disney-like, with the low lights, fake treasure chest and what not. They had someone painting some wood that was in front of a tank. It had a " Don't touch wet paint" sign. Huh? There's tons of kids that are bound to touch it, sign or not. I think that they could have painted during closing hours.    My son's favorite  was the ray/shark tank. There's several "go inside the tank" experiences that were cool.   My son was asking to leave, that was a first! There were kids every age in there and none seemed too excited. There's a little play area at the end, but it was warm and uncomfortable.  I agree with someone before who said they made the ocean boring, hehe.

I got so excited when Torched Goodness started coming to the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!! I would love to go to the Downtown market  ( I'm also dying to try  a Shortleash Hotdog!) but unfortunately I can't for now.  I tried several samples and they were all delicious. My absolute favorite is cappucino. It's amazing! My favorite ice cream flavor is Haagen Dazs coffee and this tastes like that but a million times better. Very creamy, not overtly sweet, just perfect. The size is right as well and I love that Chef Eric devised a clever way to get your creme brulee to go.  So if you run into the Torched Goodness truck, do yourself a favor and get some creme brulee!!

I take my 2 year old to Great Play and we both really enjoy it. It's a fairly big space with tons of things for the kids to do. The classes are 50 minutes long and they sing, go to 3 stations with different activities, there's swing time. During the week there's also "Free Play" which is a time when you can take your kid to the gym and there's unstructured play time.  My son's favorite is the interactive projectors, where he can throw balls to the walls and the image moves! It's pretty cool. The music they play is enjoyable to the parents as well. Everything from Grease soundtrack, Jackson 5, 80's, Cold Play. The classes are directed by 3 "coaches". They are all very nice and engaging.   I wish the front desk area was a bit bigger as it can get crowded with parents, kids, babies, especially when a class is ending and another is starting.

I love kettle popcorn! Of coursed it's at it best on a fair freshly popped, salty and sweet and crunchy. Microwave corn is an in case of emergency and bag one, meh.  Kettle corn at Popcornopolis is delicious! It would be perfect if it was hot, but that would be asking too much:)  I also really like the nacho cheese which is pretty spicy and the sour cream and onion. It's great that you can mix different types of popcorn in the cone if you want to!  Oh! And you can have samples of any and all popcorn flavors!  Besides popcorn they had other treats like caramel/chocolate apples and dipped bananas.  The people working there are very nice and helpful. They even got my 2 y/o extra popcorn on a little plate:)   It's a bit pricey but worth it.

Delicious cupcakes! I have tried them on several occasions and so far no dry cake or too sweet frosting. The salted caramel was my favorite. I thought the Nutella Banana was going to be my favorite, but while the cake was delicious (like a banana muffin) the frosting tasted just like regular milk chocolate. No really discernible Nutella taste. The Oreo cupcake was great!! The frosting tastes just like the creamy filling.

Went for lunch. There was only another table occupied. It smelled strongly of old fried food. Ordered some rolls and a miso soup. The soup was warm not hot, the rolls were just ok. Service was good. Not a place that I'll get out of my way to go. *2.5*

Disappointing. I like the concept but the burger didn't delivered. It was flavorless, even with cheese. I ended up adding salt to it, which is a first.  The bun was harder than I expect a burger bun to be. The fries (half regular/half sweet potatoes) were ok. I liked the soda dispensing machine, the lemon-lime tasted better than any Sprite, 7-Up or Sierra Mist. For a 1/3 lbs cheeseburger, fries and soda it was almost $12.00. While I'll gladly pay that amount for the concept (organic, grass fed, etc) I expect the food to be flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately it wasn't.  *2.5 stars*

We had a wonderful meal at EVO. The service was great, I enjoyed my drink (Cantaloupe Tiny) and ambiance. I had the EVO salad and ate every bite. Roasting the kale and Brussels sprouts brings out their flavor and adding goat cheese just rounded it perfectly. I had the pork belly risotto and it wasn't watery or flavorless. It was probably on the salty side but I like salty so it wasn't a problem for me, it was very good. My husband had the pasta Alfredo and enjoyed it as well. For desserts they were out of the tiramisu so we ordered the zeppolini and they were delicious. Our waiter even brought me a little side of Nutella.  They have a parking lot which is a huge plus, not having to go around looking were to park. We'll certainly come back.

I admit it. I was prepared to not be impressed, but I was and I really enjoyed it. It's expensive and honestly I can't see spending more than one hour maybe two. The 3D movie is wonderful. The atrium is lovely, so many butterflies flying around, landing on you. I felt like I was in another country. While my kids liked it, we discovered my 3 y/o  is terrified of butterflies, hehe.  Definitely go first thing in the morning: less crowded and not as hot. Like someone mentioned, it's a place to go at least once.

I was not in a hurry to try The Gladly and now I wonder what was I thinking?? Great service and delicious food. Food so good I still think of it! We had the cheese fondue to start. You can go wrong with melted cheese. I had the scallops for my entree and they were the best scallop dish I have had in a long time. If it wasn't bad manners, I would have licked my plate clean.  The drinks were amazing, I love a cocktail that's not just a bunch of bottled syrups and commercial flavored vodka. The weakest dish was dessert, bread pudding. Nothing to write home about. I'm certainly going back!

I'm no baker or pastry chef or chocolatier or whatever but I enjoy eating cakes, pastries and chocolates. So that should count for something. That being said, I like NBC cakes, they're moist, very nice flavor and while sometimes the frosting can be a bit too much, is still good.  I really like the red velvet ( I had better, but theirs is still good), marble and lemon ones.    I like the mini bundt cakes, you can try them before splurging on a big one. I do find the cakes expensive but not in a " I wouldn't spend my money ever on one of these cakes!" expensive. Good for a special occasion.
