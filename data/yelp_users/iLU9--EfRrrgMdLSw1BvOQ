I have been going to the Grotto since 2001.  Gary runs the place like a NY style joint.  The service can be bad but that is part of the charm.  I have sampled EVERYTHING on the menu and love it all.  Diana Manages the place and she is Fantastic!    My favorite meal: I start with the Zucchini( pan fired with a lite batter and amazing white sauce) Then move on to the soup ( Amazing Minestrone) Then have the Chicken Carolina (Every bite melts in your mouth) Or the Sea Bass Picatta( Soo good) I Finnish it off with a White Chocolate Tartufo or a Cannoli.   Complete the meal with a nice bottle of wine in one of the tables that opens to the sidewalk and you have the perfect evening.  Not the cheapest place in the world.  But one of my favorite restaurants in the world!  And if its baseball season,  the only game on will be the Yankees so don't even ask to change the channel!

Very nice commercial coffee shop. The baristas are very friendly and the atmosphere is conducive for working on your laptop or meeting someone for coffee. They have a shelf with communal books and games located around the corner near the restrooms, so they don't mind if you stay a while. The outdoor covered patio is large with seven or so tables and a couple umbrellas. It stays in shade for a good part of the day so you can enjoy your coffee outdoors even on a warmer day. The only downside to the patio is its proximity to the drive through speaker, so you hear everyone placing their order. They make a good chai tea latte and the baristas even offered my dogs organic dog treats.

Wow!  was this a leap of faith to go here.  So using my handy smart phone and Yelp I began a search of Food Near Fremont street.  Having given up hope that is ever a decent affordable meal in LV I found Tinoco's and made the plunge.  I mean Really?  A lobster Claw machine for $2 and then they make it for you at no additional cost!  You have to be kidding me.  So it was about 10pmand we wandered over to give it a shot.  The Casino Lobby is so scary you almsot don't want to even give the place a chance.  But I held my Girl close and we made our way to the back.  Once you get past the casino floor things get a little bit nicer.  And the entrance to the restaurant reminds me of a movie style Mob restaurant.  But with WAY nice people to greet you.  The front bar is quant and once inside the HUGE booths seemed to be upholstered in an ostrich type of material.  I fell in love right there.    Well, we were the only ones in the joint and quickly decided that the must be closing.  Liz our waitress came up and said there was no rush even though we felt we must.  She told us the specials and we went for the Steak and Shrimp Scampi on mashed potatoes with veggies.  took the Broccoli soup and got the crab cakes appetizer.  Crab cakes were amazing,  very fresh and on a  bed of tasty salad like veggies.  the Red peper sauce was fantastic.  The Broccoli soup was out of this world,  We could make a meal out of just that.  The steak was not the best i had ever had,  but it was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were not over cooked as well,  thats a big plus!  The Sauce was delicious and so were the veggies.    The service was impeccable as well.  So for us it was no hard decision to return there for breakfast.   If your in Old Vegas and looking for a great meal with fresh ingredients.  prepared any way you like by nice people who actually care about you and their food.  This is your place.  A new favorite for us.  I will be making a stop there every time I make it to Vegas!

These were probably the worst street size tacos I've ever had and I can't believe I paid $10 for them.  I'm not sure what took them so long to bring them out. The shrimp taco was cold and I ate half of it before finding any shrimp. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice enough and took order but didn't seem very interested in our presence.  The best thing about this place was their artwork and decor.
