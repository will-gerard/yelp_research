I am a frequent patron of Four Peeks. I will say, parking is horrendous even on a medium night there, but it never stops me from showing up. The beer, food, atmosphere, and service is always top notch.   I am always craving their nachos.

Golfland is the place to be for mini golf, their arcade is okay and always working well, but it is packed tight. Mini golf at golfland is a great date night, and they maintain it very well. During the summer sunsplash is fun!

I was hungry after hiking flat iron, and will say the saloon hit the spot. The beer selection is limited, but I don't hold it against them, I don't expect craft beer at a saloon in the middle of nowhere. Their prickly pear margarita was tasty and refreshing.  My only problem with the food was that the New York strip was very thin. They did a good job of cooking it to order, and I enjoyed the taste.  My issue was with the service. Our waitress was very slow. At the end she apologized for the slow service, and I can look past that, but not after receiving bad service. There were 5 of us, and when the bill came she didn't ask us if we wanted it split up. I tried to make things easy for her and collected everyone's credit cards and wrote next to each item on the receipt the last four of the credit card to put it item on. As I was about to finish up she came by and asked what I was doing. When I tried to explain, she told me I shouldn't have done that. She said she knew what should be charged to each person and she would separate out the receipts.   She left for a while and came back saying that she didn't know who ordered each drink. Had she let me put it on the receipt like I had attempted, she wouldn't have had to come back and ask. The way she told me I was wrong to try to help her was insulting in front of my friends, and then to come back and not know who ordered what was frustrating.  When she funally came back with the receipts we noticed she charged us a 20% gratuity. On their menu it says a "suggested 20% gratuity is added to groups of 6 or more." There were 5 of us so it shouldn't have been applied. There also was no option to remove the gratuity. I tend to tip generously unless the service is poor, or I am insulted. She never came back around so we could ask the mandatory gratuity be removed. We finally just left paid and left.

We went here for a late night meal. The service was prompt, and the came out nice and hot. My only issue is their "bottomless" fries come out in small portions.   Other than that, the food was great and our waitress was really nice. I've rarely had an issue with Red Robin and will come back again.

I spent hours trying to find a good calligraphy fountain pen for my girlfriend online. After tiring myself out, I called Scottsdale pen, and asked if they had fountain pens meant for calligraphy. I should have expected that they would, after all, they sell pens as their main product. When I got down there he already had calligraphy pen out and ready for me.   It was the perfect pen for my girlfriend. She loved the gift, and was so surprised that I found the perfect calligraphy pen that she had been eyeing for a few months. Can't beat that level of service.

This is an intense hike. I would recommend preparing for this by hiking at least once a week starting two months prior to this hike. It will take anywhere from 4 to 6 hours depending on your pacing, amount of breaks taken, and how much time you spend at the top.  Some tips: Wear hiking gloves. You will be using your hands ALOT, and gloves will mean less pain for you.   Wear shoes that have top notch grip. There are a large amount spots with slick, loose rock, and steep inclines.   Be prepared for a little/novice climbing.  Bring food like power bars. You will burn a lot of calories and will need the nourishment.  Bring at least 3 liters of water per person. You will get thirsty!

We ordered our food online, and when it didn't show up after a bout 40 minutes we called to check on the order. They said they never received it, and we placed the order over the phone. They quoted 20 to 30 minutes, and it's been and hour and we still haven't received our food. We just called them and they said it was on the way and would be a few more minutes. This is ridiculous. I don't recommend you ever order delivery from them.

I've been here many times and have always had great service. I love their yellow curry, and haven't heard anything bad about their menu. They do accommodate  both mild and Thai hot so anyone can enjoy. This is an example of a small restaurant that has stepped up and  offers great food for a fair price with good service!

I liked the food, and the atmosphere is nice, but the price just isn't worth it to me. The tacos are so little, yet really pricey. The curry came is a little bit of chicken and barely any rice. We had to order an extra side of rice. The taste can only go so far in justifying the price.  Update: I have updated my review from three stars to one because about an hour after leaving the original, I got sick. I will spare the details, but I will say, it wasn't worth it.

I forgot to update the review. After posting how I got sick from the food, I was called by a manager. His first concern was if I was feeling better. I was invited back, and was told to personally ask for him so he could ensure that my next visit was nothing less than perfect.   I do think the food is overpriced, and I didn't like that I had to pay for extra quinoa to have enough in my yellow curry, but anyone who reaches out like they did gets 4 stars in my book!

They have good drink selection and the food is okay too, but their service is really slow. I have been here at least 10 times, and can not remember ever having good or prompt service.  Also, they have 2 pool tables that are kind of gross, but still cost a dollar to play. Make it free or 50 cents at most, especially if you aren't going to keep up the table

I've only been here a few times, and I really like it. The beer selection is amazing, and their food is good. After their kitchen closes they have a solid cheese and meat board, just ask for more toasted bread!

This is one of my favorite chipotle locations. They do a great job cooking the steak. Too many locations overcook their steak. They are always nice and courteous, and have taken care of me every time I go in.

The food is good and the $5 alcohol special is nice. The tacos are really solid, but pricey for how small they are.

The last time I went to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, in the end I got a tasty burger, but it the service was absolutely horrible. I went with a group of friends, and when we went to order, I was last. The person before me was celebrating his birthday, and ordered the giant burger that he had 2 minutes to finish to get it free (and I'm sure his picture on the wall). The waitress went and got the manager to come explain how it worked depending on how many patties he ordered on the burger.   While doing this, the waitress appeared to forget about me, which I can understand, but every time she came by and checked in, I was ignored. She would as how we are doing and as I would try to speak up to get her attention, or even raise my hand, she was already walking away.   Everyone else at the table had their drinks, and food. When the manager brought over the giant burger for my friend, I told him that all my friends were finishing up with their food, and I hadn't even gotten a drink.   He asked what I wanted and said he would make sure the waitress was made aware of the situation and properly trained. Before I got my burger (all my friends were done with theirs, and the one who was celebrating his birthday finished his giant birthday burger) I was given the check for a burger that wasn't even given to me yet! Then the waitress had the audacity to come back and ask for my card so I could pay for the burger! I still hadn't been served it yet!  When the manager came back, I thought he was going to apologize, and offer me something for the atrocious service I was given. Instead he told the group he was heading a scavenger hunt contest (or something) and wanted us to go.   I finally received my burger, and ate it as quick as possible (because now my friends were waiting on me to leave), without any apology from the waitress, or discount from the restaurant.    When you are the manager, receive a complaint, confirm that your staff made a mistake, do nothing to rectify the situation, and allow your patron to be insulted even further, it shows what you think of your customers.

I can't get enough of cornish pasty. This is a place you can try something new every time and love it.  My favorites are the Shepards Pie, lamb and mint, and the Italien. They also have solid appetizers and delicious deserts. Their beer selection is top notch, and they have amazing specials on Irish Car bombs. If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out.

I always have a great time at top golf. Be prepared to spend some money, but if you bring 5 friends with you it will be quite a bit less expensive, as the bays can hold up to six people to divide up the cost. They have a full menu, and bar too! The food is usually good, I will say the nachos are EXTREMELY over priced. You pay for a dollar a chip for the nachos.  Though some of the food is overpriced, it is worth it for a great time. Be prepared to get addicted to Top Golf!
