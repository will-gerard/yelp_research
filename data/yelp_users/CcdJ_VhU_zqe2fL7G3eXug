The BEST macaroni and cheese anywhere. It doesn't seem possible that a classy upscale place like this with a fabulous wine and cheese list would have incredible macaroni and cheese. Ken knows what he is doing here and even though the food is every bit as good as the food I have had in Paris, his desserts will cause you to give in and forget about your diet for the day. Ask your server which cheeses are at their best and simply have a glass of wine to go with it if you like. If you order coffee it may take a bit as they always make it fresh when I am there. Worth the drive, wait or ruining your diet for.

If you love Polish pastries and thrilling food for Easter this is the spot to go.  Fresh breads, cookies, sandwiches to die for- you can't go wrong here.  The owners are adorable and the staff is very helpful. Forget the run of the mill donut shop- this place will make you forget about any other donut shop. Great for breakfast or lunch.

Bistro 24 has really nice food with an excellent and interesting bread assortment. Every time I have been there, whether while working or not, I have had excellent service. I must confess, one day at lunch I asked what was going to be that night's dessert.  Not only did the server tell us, but he brought us one. It was a fresh out of the oven chocolate macaroons that wasn't going on the menu until evening. It melted in my mouth.It is service and food like that which keep bringing me back.

MMMMmmm good.  I enjoy their food and really like the salads. It is a fun place to pop in for a lunch.  I can go light or heavy with a meal and get a enjoyable glass of wine to go with it.

My favorite Phoenix restaurant. Vincent understands customer loyalty and his hospitality and food will bring you back again and again. Often when we travel, my husband and I will remark that Vincent has spoiled us because we compare everything to eating with him.  If you like goose or duck, he makes it the best. My son loves the short ribs, my daughter loves the ravioli. We all love his pastries and desserts.  The salmon quesedilla and duck tamales are just a couple of the magnificent French/southwestern fusion foods to knock your socks off.  GREAT wine selection.

I love Vincent and Leevon! I have been going here for at least 8 years and feel like I am at home every time I return.  The hot chocolate is magnificent. The spinach quiche is the best I have ever had. Coq Au van is my all time comfort food. It is so savory and tender. Allow yourself time to relax and enjoy your meal if you can. Other wise it is still worth it just to pop in for a bite.

Don't be afraid to try the green eggs and ham. It is out of this world.  T. Cooks is beautiful, with superb service and a wonderful menu. The desserts are design masterpieces.  The table bread is fresh and made every day.  There is certain to be something on the menu you will fall in love with.  Whether you eat in the court yard, inside or on the patio, this place is perfect by yourself, with your sweat heart or a group.  The grounds at the Royal Palms are beautiful and you will feel like you are in Paradise.

The fresh MJ breads and Tammie Coe cakes/pastries are the best on the west coast.  The communter sandwich is my favorite breakfast food.  The to go salads are fresh and more than you can eat. It is a very popular place, so be prepared to wait in line, but it is worth it!

Postino's has the best brushetta around. Fresh ingredients and a marvelous wine list to go with it. It is always busy but if you go a little early for lunch it is easier to get in.  The parking can be rough but plan ahead and it is worth it. This is one place with food and atmosphere to rival one of my favorite places in Florence Italy.  Don't rush, be patient and above all be open minded.  You may discover a dish you would have never considered and love it.

I really enjoy this place.  The wine selections are nice and they have given me samples to try before I purchased a bottle. The employees have been very interested in customer satisfaction every time I have been there.  This is pretty darn good for having been there several times. Everything I have eaten there has been enjoyable. This is great place for date night, but not a first date, since if it doesn't work out you will want to keep this place as one of your gems to go and relax at.  It is also fabulous to go there with girl friends.

My favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread.  Great indoor or outdoor seating.  Many times I have called in for take out food there for dinner parties and have never been disappointed. The food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinner parties. Cut it into four pieces and place in a linen covered bowl to keep warm and moist. Reheats fabulously.

I know the company you go to dinner with makes a big difference in your experience while dining, but even though all of the company with me has been wonderful, I have enjoyed eating each of my meals I have ordered at  the keg. My husband and I have eaten here many times. I never order the steak but always try something else. My husband always orders a steak and they are just fine. It is a wonderful place to go for a nice glass of wine and a simple dinner. The service is good and there are different places to sit like the lounge, main dining area or the patio.  We love to go in the winter and get a seat on the patio to talk and look at the stars over our meal and a good glass of red wine. Confortable and romantic.

The Pork Shop is a humble place with an amazing selection of pork.  If you are a fan of The Splendid Table and love the adventures of Jane and Michael Stern on NPR, this shop is a must do! Not only do they have green chili burritos to go but the menu is so large that unless you don't eat pork you can not leave without buying something. The Hot Italian Sausage is the best I have ever found. It is lean and flavorful and extremely clean tasting. The "sticks" (think slim Jim's) are available it 8 varieties and they usually have them as a sample. The flavor, texture and visual aspect of them make them perfect for a snack or sliced for an appetizer. They even work well sliced the long way on a baguette for a sandwich instead of lunch meat.  Bacon, roasts, ribs, salami, you name it is all there in this clean, well lit and very organized shop.  As for eating there, you have a choice of picnic tables outside. I prefer the one under the pecan tree. If you like "real Arizona" like it was 20-30 years ago in the east valley, this is the place.

I agree with the other reviewer as far as the golf goes.  I ate there (at the restaurant which is now run independently) a couple of weeks ago. The setting is first rate, but the manager and staff need to take 101 classes on service.  We couldn't tell who worked there and who didn't. This was during a wine tasting event. There weren't any name tags or aprons, let alone uniforms to let you know who was serving. I called ahead and asked about dinner etc. After 20+ minutes of waiting after being seated we went to the bar to ask if we needed to order our food there- finally- 10 minutes later we had a waitress. The food wasn't bad and there was live music.  All of the glasses were dirty looking and the tables looked run down and yucky. They need table cloths, spotless glasses, uniforms, and managing. Also I checked out the restroom. TWO small rolls of tp for the entire ladies room. Pathetic. It was almost enough to make me want to put in an application there just to clean it up.  It is such a great location it seems a great waste not to have a better business going on at the restaurant.

Kokopelli Winery is in a great location but the food and wine are wanting.   The white wines were very strange and the reds didn't make me want to buy a case.  I did purchase three wines- one white and two reds, hoping that at a later time I might grow to love them.  The whites are too sweet for me and the flavors are weird. Yes weird. The food wasn't bad, but we did really enjoy the music.  It is fun just to check out.  I will go back and try different vintages from Kokopelli in the future.  It may end up developing some unique vintages and is different enough to make it worth my time.

Make a reservation!  The food is great. The wine list wonderful. The service quite good.  The down side?  It is packed. We had to basically circle a table on the patio, like hyenas to get a place to sit.  Everything I have tried there was superb. I really enjoy the vegetable sides. Very savory.

Three things make this a five star chocolate shop.  Maybe four.  1. The chocolates are beautiful in taste and presentation.  2.The store smells and looks wonderful.  3. Clearance sales after the holidays- you can get great deals because the box is out of season.  4. They make terrific gifts.   I love to have dinner parties and the post holiday chocolates are first rate for desserts. Remove them from the boxes and place them on tiered silver trays and watch your dinner guests' eyes light up. Many people would rather have a piece or two of Godiva Chocolate for dessert than a piece of cake or pie.

What can I possibly say?  Everything they serve there is wonderful.  The selection in their little grocery section is inspirational. Even when I go with a list, I end up with a dozen things I didn't know I needed at home for my pantry.  They have amazing prosciutto.  If you are a foodie, this is one fun place.

You will be surprised by the quality of food at Cafe Boa. Set in a little strip mall, you may not expect such a classy bar and restaurant. The service is terrific and the servers will remember you when you come back. They like to make you happy there with the service, but the real happiness comes from the food and wine selections. It is right off of the freeway.  It will be worth a stop in.

Tammie Coe and MJ Bread is the best place for bread and pastries on the western side of the US. I kid you not.  My family from Illinois is still talking about the Banans Foster cake I got from there five years ago.  I have destroyed many people's diets by taking them there.  During Lent I don't even drive down Roosevelt because I have little self control when it comes to their bread or brioche.  No less than two dozen times I have purchased their food and taken it to work, charity events or dinner parties and every time people fall in love with this food.  The staff are fun and smart and will help you get what you need. It is an outstanding place to pop into for lunch downtown.  The foccacia is so good you can it that for a meal. Tammie is a master cake maker and they are delicious too. I can't say enough how I love their goodies.  Check out their happy hour! Yes- that is right after 4:00 the goodies are half price.  So amazingly good.

I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food. The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy. Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side. It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.

FUN! Great wine selection. Music every time I have been there and they even have a movie group in the back room on special nights.  Mario and Ginger are very welcoming and make genuinely great hosts as they make you feel you are in their home sharing a meal. There is something special at this place that you can't quite put your finger on. My kids love it and my husband and I love to go there alone too. Everything is fresh and delightful. Pick anything on the menu- you will be happy.

I have been going to Va Bene for about five years now and still love it.  It is one of the few classy places to go dancing to live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The manager and staff understand customer service perfectly.  The seasoned butter and bread they bring to your table is fresh and savory. The pastas are always delicious. We have never a special that we didn't like- but the ravioli special is always our favorite.  I must say they have the BEST escargot I have ever had. It is in a delightful pastry and goes so well with a red Tuscan wine.  If you have any questions about wine, all of the servers are excellent at recommendations.  The only complaint is that the smokers need to move away from the door.  First rate!

I love Picazzo's. Not only do they make and succeed with an effort at organic and earth friendly on the menu, the menu itself is printed on recycled paper with soy based ink.  The wine list is pretty good, but if you are a BIG Italian red fan you will have to settle for their milder organic wines.  The crust on the pizzas are delicious and don't forget to try the cookie/ice cream desserts.  If you love salads- their Greek one is terrific.  If you need wheat free or other special food needs, this is a great place to go.  This place may not be appropriate for people who want salty, run of the mill cheap food. If you want a step above, this place is perfect.

I like Elephant Bar and my kids love it.  It is fun, clean and friendly with many food choices so you can take even the pickiest eater there and they will find something they like.  The ambiance is really fun and the drinks, not just wine, are fun too.  Service is always good and they did an amazing job of seating 16 of us one night.

Arcadia Farms at the Phoenix Art Museum is one of the best kept secrets down town.  Fresh, tasty and beautiful food in a classy quiet but energetic atmosphere.  Wonderful wine list, and yummy desserts! The parking is easy and free and if you are a museum member, bring your card for a 10% discount off of your bill. This is a terrific spot to go if you need a place to meet for a business lunch.  The museum is wonderful too.

Queen Creek Olive Mill is a first rate, but rural place. Spotless, easy parking and very friendly. The selections of oils, vinegars,olives, baked goods and even wines, books and cooking accessories are fantastic. If you are looking for a nice place to take someone for a small day trip this is it. It gives a real taste of rural Arizona but with a very classy atmosphere. The food in the restaurant is quite good and has a huge selection. If you are vegetarian you can even find great choices. The baked goods and gelato are perfect for those with a sweet tooth.  Friday and Saturday evening there is live music. The wine selection is decent and the tours are interesting. Make sure to ask plenty of questions if you get the chance.  This is a great location to take someone if they need to sit down regularly or need wheelchair access.

You won't be expecting food this good hidden away in this location.  The wine selection is not only fun, inspiring and delicious but also beautiful.  As the name implies (cork as in wine bottle cork- and the decor) wine is a big deal here.  Don't be misled though- the chef from Chicago will make you squeal with delight over what ever you order. I have been there several times. A few times for a romantic dinner with my dear husband and several times with a group. The room they set up for our friend's anniversary was so special.   Try the chef's choice dinner. It is worth the money and will make for one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat.

Maybe it is cultural, but I do not like the food here. I want my own food  and not have to eat what everyone else wants. We had a chicken dish last time with capers that was so dry that drinking water with it at the same time was a necessity. I felt like a raccoon. It was too loud for us to have a real conversation and I didn't want to yell.

The savory crepes are the star here. The staff is not. My main issue with it is that they act a bit put out if you don't know their routine and they were also very distracted the last time I was there, with each other.  I have been there over a dozen times as it has a nice patio area where you can sit with your coffee and crepe and read.

Hanny's is the sexiest restaurant I have ever been to. It was a clothing store many years ago and has been revived as a beautiful restaurant. The food is quite good with a blend of usual and not so usual choices. Lovely wine selections and good service. The fresh flowers on the tables, cleanliness and re-purposed building give this place and A+. It is a snap to take the light rail to get there or walk to if you're downtown. It is also a magnificent place to people watch and hang out at the bar. You don't have to go to Scottsdale to hang out at a classy joint. This is it.

I love this place. Not just because of the history of this manager and staff and their loyalty to each other but also because the food is good and amazingly cheap! Lunch there is my favorite. I can get a table by myself and sit and read over a glass of wine, delicious food ( I love the wrap) and excellent service. I have never had anything on the menu I wasn't totally satisfied with. Fun ambiance and terrific patio. Also extremely easy parking!!!

Vincent's really does have New York style pizza. The closest I have had outside of my favorite Times Square slices. I have tried MANY of their pizzas but I must confess I am a sucker for anything deep dish they make. They use real cheese. There is a tidy wine selection and many beverage choices. The location next to the movie theater makes it perfect for a night out with the kids or with your honey. If you are a sports fan this may well become one favorite hot spot for you. Large wall mounted televisions will supply you if you sit inside and people watching on the patio is very amusing. You can watch everyone from Jr. High girls trying to act 17, Ahwatukee cougars over at RA, to boys smoking hookahs next door "being cool".  Jerry has the personality of a talk show host ( I mean that in the best way he is so outgoing.) and the staff are very professional. There may be kids working there, but they are working. Quite impressive leadership from the employers. They want to get it right for you.

At first when this place opened I loved it even though the service was awful (except for Nicole). The MJ breads and croque monsieur were fantastic. After Chris left though it has taken a dive.  The service the last three times "3"! I have been there has been terrible. The people at the counter acted like we were bothering them simply by placing an order ( I am very sensitive to being respectful or them because I know working with the public is really hard).  The egg/chicken dish I ordered was slimy and there were odd pieces of bone in the mystery cuts of chicken. The tortillas were burned and greasy. The glasses/coffee cups were dirty and there wasn't any cream for the coffee. Also the tables and chair were sticky. Please wipe them off!  Unless someone can convince me there has been a huge improvement, I will never go back. This is very sad because it was so terrific to start with and my kids loved the patio which is so fun.   It was fantastic for happy hour. They have had some great wines- especially the Klinker Brick.  Very sad.

Zoyo is a very cute self serve yogurt place. I love the garage doors they open on nice days. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and it has good parking. I don't mind changes in the flavors because I like the adventure and possibility of something new on each visit.  I must say almost everyone I have seen there has been extremely overweight. Some people want smaller cups and I agree. I can put a small amount into the large cup, but it feels chintzy. If they had smaller cups, like at gelato places, I would feel a bit more psychologically satisfied. The large cups are to increase their sales, but what ends up happening is that I don't go there so I don't have to deal with the temptation.

Yoasis is set up like other self serve yogurt places but it also has a meeting room as well as patio seating. The parking is excellent and the place is spotless.  They have a punch card for frequent patrons and I will admit that I am on my third punch card. After nine purchases your 10th one is free.  Every flavor I have had has been excellent. The topping selection is always clean and well organized.  This is a very popular spot for kids Fridays after school. It is also very popular for families on the weekends.  Well air conditioned indoor seating is also very nice and it is very accessible for handicapped needs.

Oh boy! The fish tacos are amazing.  For a very small price you get a very large amount of fresh and delicious food. This is one place a teenager and adult can agree has fabulous food. If you are a Republican don't be scared away by the name or the color scheme.  The food is worth getting even if it looks a little, um, unconventional. The parking is free and the staff are very friendly.

If you like LGO and Cheauvront you will love Wedge and Bottle. The choices of cheese and charcuterie are first rate. Sit for a bit with a glass of wine or specialty beer and cheese plate either at one of the neat little tables inside or out on the patio.  Pastas, honey,jams, olives, gourmet salts, crackers are just a few of the flavor filled offerings they have. There are sandwiches to fill your hunger need. If they could just start carrying MJ bread and local Queen Creek Olive Mill products!  The staff is friendly, very knowledgeable and ready to help you make a selection for cocktail hour or dinner at your house tonight.  Don't be afraid to try any of the samples they love to share. Their goat cheeses and triple cream Bries are savory and inspire fabulous pairings with the bottles of wine they carry.

WD Coffee Company- named for the initials of the owner's children is a fresh, clean and up beat new coffee shop in the Ahwatukee Foothills. In the morning they offer yogurt, breakfast burritos, smoothies and an assortment of pastries. There are plenty of beverage choices whether you crave coffee or tea to my favorite Izzie bottled soft drinks.  They do have some games and a few children's books but need checkers/dominoes and the like for those of us who yearn for a more European hang out of a coffee shop. They also have periodicals available.  The Wi-Fi is free, the parking is very good and the view from the side patio is really nice especially with the misters going.  Eric-one of the owners is local and this is his first coffee shop. The other owner lives in Seattle. He also owns two coffee shops there.  They have the potential to do really well, especially as a morning or afternoon meeting place.  The staff is very friendly and eager to wait on you.

Terrific Happy Hour! Went there with some girl friends and ordered the house Chardonnay for $3 a glass- very good and worth the money.  Also the pizza salad.  HUGE and excellent.  Made for a great lunch the next day too.  The chipotle humus is a must. You simply need to try their pita bread.  It is the best.

Do not go there if you are on a diet. I wondered how a place could stay in business selling Bundt cakes. Well, one taste showed me how.  The carrot cake (small one) is very very good for breakfast with a cup of coffee.  The chocolate cakes have gotten rave reviews when I have taken them for desserts.  The chocolate cakes at home have caused my children and others to rush through dinner just to get to dessert.  These are not to die for cakes but they are fun and yummy.
