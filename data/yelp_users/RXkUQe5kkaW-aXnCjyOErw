I saw Traci B for my haircut yesterday. She did a great job of listening and understanding what my needs were. I have naturally curly hair and need to keep my length or else it will shrink and look crazy when I don't straighten it. She made sure to only take off only what I requested and no more. Not only was Traci friendly, but so was the entire staff.   The only reason I didn't give the salon a 5 was because they close so early! As a corporate employee, I leave work at 5-6PM and the salon closes at 6 so that makes it very difficult for me to schedule my appointments. I usually enjoy getting my haircut on a Friday so I can enjoy my weekends without having to worry about beauty visits.   Other than that. It was good enough for me to schedule my next visit before leaving yesterday. For me, a hater of haircuts, that's a pretty big deal.

My husband and I love eating exotic food. Ethiopian happens to be one of our many favorites. We have tried many different Ethiopian restaurants, mostly in Chicago, and this place (to our surprise) was so much better than anything we had back home and at a better price too.   Here are our favorites: The fish, red lentils, cabbage with potatoes, and the collards.  Soooo good.   We always max out our plates when we go here. Not a speck of food left on that large tray.   Always happy to come here and love to crave it.

I really enjoyed my experience here today!  I will be coming back for sure.   Benjamin was super nice and really did a nice job. Linda was quiet but she was also pleasant.   Small place but welcoming.

Snow Nails has only gotten better with the new management!  I love it before and I love it more now. She seems to be doing a great job with others as well since she has bee REALLY busy the last two times I was there.   Give her a shot.

Yea...never going back here again.   SEVERAL bad, odd, and uncomfortable things happened during one mani/pedi session....UNBELIEVABLE!  **FIRST -- so yelp has that monocle feature that I had just learned about and I was innocently scanning the buildings in awe as my husband pulled up in front of the nail salon to drop me off. A woman, who I believe is Jenny (woman with long dark hair), hurries over to me as I got out of the car and nosily starts hovering over my shoulder and my phone asking "what you doing with that camera?! why you point over here?!" In an attempt to try to keep myself from pushing her away from me and telling her that what I do with my phone is non of her business, I calmly showed her the app saying that it was something I just discovered and was trying it out... he looks at me for a moment then laughs saying " Ohhh, haha, what they say about us?" and I told her nothing came up for them and that I would just have to trust them.   ** SECOND -- as I was getting my pedi, a woman was getting her nails done directly in front of me, Jenny kept insisting that the woman try a color that she didn't want while also prying into her personal life. The woman looked at me and gave me an uncomfortable smile.   ** THIRD -- It was time for my mani and same gentleman that did my pedi began doing my mani. So I paint my own nails at home between my manis and I don't always put down a bottom coat before dark colors like red, which if you know anything about nail polish, it can leave the top layer of your nail a yellow color. So this guy was he was removing my nail polish saw the tint on my nails and several times really loudly was like "YOUR NAILS ARE YELLOW. YOU CANT PAINT NAILS AND NOT PUT BOTTOM COAT. ITS YELLOW. LOOK, YEA, YOU CANT DO THAT, YOUR NAIL TURN YELLOW" the few people that were in there turned and looked at me. I was pretty embarrassed as it's not like my have fungus nail or something, but he was so insistent on repeating my mistake, I might as well of had an infections disease spewing from my hands...  *** FOURTH -- a man comes in with his maybe 8 year old daughter to get her nails done. He made it very clear that she told him she wanted pink nails with white tips to match whatever  dance competition outfit she was going to be wearing.  The man then went to sit down in the pedi massage chair to wait for his daughter to get her nails down. REMINDER this is an 8 year old girl with super small nails. she was only going to get some color and that's about it. they were charging him something like 30+ bucks for that, if I were him I would sit wherever I wanted too. Jenny goes over to him and tells him with a laugh "you want  to get pedicure?" he said no. She replies by saying with not as much humor, "ha..massage chair for pedicures" he looks at her and continues to eat his slim jim. she waits about 1 minutes then says again but more serious "Massage chairs are for pedicures"...when he didn't budge or get up she turns to his daughter and says "sweetie what color you want for your nails" (remember they already established that it was pink nails with white tips) the dad says "pink with white" Jenny continues to say "huh sweetie? what color you want?" and again dad says "we already said pink with white tips!" the little girl stayed quiet looking uncomfortable as her dad is being repeatedly ignored by her.  *** FIFTH -- There were a few other occurances of them prying and pushing things on people. I was one. I asked to try 2 colors on two nails to determine which I wanted (it was between a teal or a plum) he gets up and brings me literally a sparkly puke green and says, "this one so nice, you should do this one"... I obviously told him absolutely not! I wouldn't mind green or anything but this color was out of this world gross. Another girl who was a tomboy said she didn't want any color or gloss on her pedi. they asked her about a dozen times if they could put a flower on her toe. she looked so irritated. I was then asked several questions about what I did, where I lived, where did I come from, etc. I don't mind getting asked a few questions about myself, but I might as well have given her my SS number and CC info too.   *** SIXTH -- lastly after I was all done getting painted, was complemented several times but without a breath in-between I was told to come back for next time. It made it sound so insincere "Oh that color looks so good on your skin, you come back next time" "oh you from Chicago? you come back next time here" and several others like that.   *** SEVENTH -- my nail polished chipped in less than 3 days.... I was not pleased. Also they didn't clean up my cuticles very well. I had to go home and fixed them as I didn't want to be in there any longer than I had to.  Well there you have it. I could have gone into more detail but I would have to write a short story... too much drama, too much of a lot of things.   Stay away if you can. its not worth it.

Got the Lamb Vindaloo and a beer. I love lamb, but I don't love spicy. It was a little spicy for me, but still delicious.   GET THE LEEK SOUP. Amazingggg.

This place was great. We had been trying to go for almost a year now but when we drive by and see the line, we tend to retreat and go elsewhere. I understand why. I love how large the selection is and the fact that they are really flexible with their menu/choices. Makes it easier for us unfortunate folks who have to eat a strict diet (damn you self image!!)   We had the roasted turkey sandwich with everything on it (minus mayo) and had it on low carb-high protein bread. Amazing bread by the way. It's like "eating nothing" as my husband puts it. Only 60 something calories per slice and only 1g carb per serving! You can buy a loaf to go but it will run you about $5 a loaf, but if you go now they are running a buy 1 get 1 free deal.   We also had the tomato bisque, which was rich, creamy, and delicious... Our trainer will not approve of that selection. Oh well! Extra hour of cardio should take care of that.   Overall I enjoyed my experience there. Loved the music too. I'm a big fan of the oldies.   Try to go after 3 pm. If you try to go on the weekend... Be ready to wait 30-40 minutes before 12:00pm. Popular Sunday after church location.

I love Cracker Barrel... Hate poor customer service.  Right off the bat I'm already not in the best mood having come home from the hospital at 5am and spent nearly 5 hours there trying to get through over 8 hours of contractions (only to find that there was no chance I was having this baby yet). *sigh* Anyway...in hopes to cheer me up my husband suggests we get some of my fav pancakes at Cracker Barrel (this is a big deal for us since we have been dieting for the last 4 months, plus we even had our trainer's approval for an epic cheat meal). I get to my table and sit down to find that I sat in a pile of watery chocolate milk....gross.  I called someone over to complain and there was no "Oh! I'm so sorry that you will be uncomfortable eating the rest of your breakfast with a wet sticky butt because we didn't properly wipe down or check the table and chairs for spill and crumbs. Please let me see what we can do to make up for it" ...all I got was a new chair and measly "oh sorry..."   I might be making a big deal out of this but that's gross and annoying! I really don't enjoy trying to eat my only cheat meal while feeling like I peed myself :(   Moving on... Food. Pancakes were great as usual. Eggs over easy were done just the way I like.  I ordered turkey sausage but didn't get them until I almost finished my meal. Turns out one of the runners forgot who it was for and it sat in the window until someone remembered who it was for.  Husband requested hot sauce and ketchup. Only the hot sauce showed up. Also, the butter he was given was grainy.   Shannon G was our server. She was very polite and looked genuinely shocked and upset when she found out I  hadn't received my sausage. She offered to refill our apple ciders to make up for it (nice gesture!) but we were already full and ready to get outta there. Shannon, the extra star is because of you.   Overall. I was full, but left more annoyed than when I came in, wet butt and all.

Jessica was AMAZING!! I went in because my calves were seriously destroyed by me working out and not stretching properly. They were so inflamed that I could barely walk.   I asked for a 1.5 hour deep tissue. She spent more than half the session on my calves and legs. Thank goodness she did! They needed it.   When i got off the table I was able to walk with nearly zero pain! I was truly shocked and thankful!   I will very much recommend her to everyone.

I love this place! My husband is Filipino and I have learned how to make many of the traditional dishes he grew up with. At mekong I can leave with everything it need and more. My in-laws brought packet of sinigang seasoning with them from Chicago and ended up leaving Arizona with more than they brought! They LOVED it and said the prices were cheaper than anything they can get in Illinois. Great fish selection and I love the meat counter. I can get every cut I need to make he dishes I love. I've even been surprised and found a Brazilian side there that I'm obsessed with (Guarana) it's hard to find unless you go to a Brazilian import store or Brazilian restaurant.   Anyway, go check it out!

Food was good and the ambiance was nice. They were able to accommodate our large group of almost 12 pregnant/new mom plus babies group.  Only thing I had a big issue with was the price for the quantity. I ordered a bowl of the soup of the day and it look more like a cup in most other restaurants. I would have been okay with it if I didn't have to pay $9 for it. I also paid $5 for the kale juice and it was almost all ice and no juice in the cup. I felt a little cheated as I could have just made a batch of both the soup and kale juice at home :( I don't know what the other ladies paid for their portions and everyone got something very different.  So I left feeling hungry and kinda bummed... Oh well. Hanging out with my other hot mamas made up for it. However, I don't know if I will be returning too soon.   Nice spot to go shopping after!

5 stars for Jamie!!! She is a sweetheart and a hard worker. I normally work with Blanca, who is also amazing, and was really bummed out when she wasn't able to do my final cleaning. They sent Jamie and I was so happy with the results. Ask for Jamie or Blanca! They are both amazing.

I hate working out in a traditional gym with a bunch of meatheads and machines. Having been an athlete all my life, my idea of a work out is simple playing a sport and using my body to work itself out. I also enjoy the support system of getting fit with a team.   This is my first week at kosama and I have to say it reminds me very much of the practice workouts I would do with my rugby, soccer, and tennis teams back in high school and college.   The coach is nice and supportive. He knows when to push and when to tell you to slow down or take it easy.   The class sizes aren't too big and everyone was really friendly from day 1. They congratulated me on a job well done after my first workout a d told me they would see the next day. I've already made friends and I look forward to seeing them each time I go in.   One thing I also really like us the music is loud and fun and at times feels like you are working out at a dance studio!   It's always nice to see a range of ages in there as well. It's not just a bunch of young guys and girls who are super fit, but you have elderly, middles aged and college aged people all doing the same workout and everyone is drenched. I can't wait to be old and look like some of the older folks to workout at kosama! Haha.   Lastly, no mirrors. I love that. It makes me focus more on what I'm doing in the moment instead of stare at myself or others in the mirror. They have TVs up on the wall that you can use to track your heart rate and calories burn of you chose to use the MyZone heart rate monitor.   Overall, this place is what I've been looking for! I plan to go for a long time.

I can't praise Chandler Dogs enough for what they do.   This place is awesome. My dog Mari absolutely loves it there. In fact, we can be a few minutes away and she will begin whining with excitement in the car because she knows where she is going.   The staff is wonderful and seem to genuinely love being there. They love on Mari as if she were their own.   We were nervous at first that they would not take our pit mix because she has a tendency to be a little overly aggressive when she plays, but after the 4 hour trial period they said she did great and all she needs is to get that energy out.   They have a cage free policy which I LOVE and they arrange the dogs by size. our dog used to go to another location for boarding and when we asked how she did during multiple 1 hour playtimes during the day, they replied by saying that they couldn't let Mari play with the rest of the pack because they couldn't handle her and she just remained in her cage. I nearly died... 3 days my poor dog stayed alone in her little prison and probably only got 1-2 15 minute walks during the day, if that. Chandler dogs would NEVER DO THAT! (Thanks Chandler Dogs)  Be prepare to have your pup possible covered in a little drool and smelling a little, but the benefits heavily outweigh the negative. Just don't send them to the spa first before day care/boarding. However they do offer bathing services as well.   PLEASE GO CHECK THEM OUT!

I have officially found my new favorite car wash!!! Everyone was super friendly, service was reasonably priced, it was fast but done properly. They are Eco friendly -- they recycle their water and use vinegar which is better on the cars. Plus while you wait for your car to get detailed you can get a nice cup of coffee or blended drink and sit under a comfy shaded area.   They were really friendly to my dog too!   Only con is that they don't do upholstery shampoos which will require me to go to another car to get that service done. But other than that, I love it. I will definitely return.

Crazy good!  We started with the pork belly and watermelon gazpacho. Both great! The heirloom tomatoes in both dishes cant be beat. So fresh and full of flavor.   For dinner I had the duck leg with an added sunny side up duck egg on top. I can't tell you how awesome it was. They had a torchon de fois gras on the side... Omg. So creamy and dense.   My husband had the grilled ribeye, med rare. Veryyyy good! Cooked perfectly and the scalloped potatoes with leeks was delicious.   Will return for sure!

Great donuts and super friendly staff/owners.   Not once but twice now I have gone in for a half dozen and I left with 1-2 extra donuta in the box at no extra charge. They are really awesome and want their customers to leave happy.   Their Thai iced tea boba is also really good!!! I personally think it's better than the one at boSa donuts.   I also love fritters so the fact that they have both blueberry and apple is pretty awesome.  Thumbs up!

I loved how clean and comfortable this theater was! My husband and I have been to the Dine in AMC in Phoenix as well as the Studio Movie Grill in Scottsdale, but since we never take advantage of the dine in those theaters it doesn't matter to us. All we care about are the comfy seats.   This AMC actually has reclining lazy-boy seats! The other two didn't recline.   It's closer to our apartment and had plenty of dining options nearby on mill.   This will be our permanent movie watching location.

Oh my GOOSSHH!!! I love these guys. Amando and Eric... My heroes. I had originally scheduled with another mover today and they only did half the work then said they couldn't finish. WHAT?! I was livid... Called everyone and was turned down for last minute help to finish the job. Spoke to John and he sent these two angels to help us out. Not only did they do the work better and faster than the other guys but they also even allowed me to push our scheduled time out a whole hour!!! Eric and Amando you will never be forgotten for this. Thank you!!! A to Z, give these guys a bonus!
