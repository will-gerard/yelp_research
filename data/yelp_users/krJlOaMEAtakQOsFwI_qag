In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches.

Waffles are yummy, chicken is juicy, service is on point. It was loud, but I liked it. I'm a loud person, the atmosphere made it easy to be myself. I'll be back.

I'm new to the area, and on my way home from the coffee shop, I decided to stop on in. After all, I needed a new collar for my pup.   I was greeted right away. Aggressively greeted, but greeted none the less. The gentleman who helped, was clearly the store manager and me spared no enthusiasm, and even up sold me to buying a new tag for the dog, too. I didn't need it, but no harm in a new shiny tag for my babe.   There was a quiet but seemingly sweet young lady behind the counter performing some kind of pet store task, and being interrupted every 35 seconds... By the gentleman who sold me on my choices and was supposed to be ringing me up. He stopped my transaction more than three times to ask her to say hello to customers who were already AGGRESSIVELY greeted by him! It took so long to just pay for the collar and tag, due to the over greeting and micro managing. I was so exhausted when I left, I said to my friend "Remind me never to go there again"  Great concept. But the guy running the place is just too much. I won't go back to see how grooming services are. Not if I have to deal with that guy, anyway.

Tuesday night adventure starts like this... We walk in, are immediately greeted and brought to the lobby. This little swanky couch and coffee table are inviting and we can't wait to sit down. The host brings us a couple drinks to enjoy while we wait for the rest of our party.   Everyone arrives, plus one. The staff happily accommodated our need for an extra setting and brought us to our table right away. Service throughout our evening was top notch. Our waiter seemed to know when to check on us and when to leave us to it. He provided the kind of service I hope for.   They don't serve Redbull and Vodka? Is this trending in downtown? Ok, I'll try their freshly prepared Ginger Ale. I added vodka and it was delish. Make it a double!  Every morsel of everything we ordered was AMAZE! Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Beets, perfectly tender street tacos, 'Lobstah' Mac n Cheese, Arancini and Chicken and Waffles! We were pigs and happy to be so.   The food was impressive and the atmosphere was warm and lively. Generally speaking, I'm a 'louder than most' person. This place was happening and I was able to laugh and chat at my normal boisterous tone. If you're looking to read a newspaper while dining this isn't your spot. It's not a 'library' and that's a great thing!  Cookie dough dessert was strange. We saw it in the menu and were all curious. Then they brought them out with the check. We laughed and laughed... They are exactly what the menu says they are 'mini cookie dough bite'. It tasted just like a bite if cookie dough.  I have my eye on a few other menu items; I'll be returning soon!

I have never dealt with a salon with such horrible customer service. I bought a groupon for Eyelash extensions. Man!! I should have read the yelp reviews first. What a joke. I have been trying to make an appointment for over a week. After getting over my confusion (what kind of company doesn't answer the phone?) I checked out what other ladies had to say about this salon... And then it was clear. This salon is a JOKE!! I canceled my groupon purchase. I will never go to this place. You shouldn't either.

Atmosphere? Awesome! Drinks? They will knock your socks off. Micah has won mixologist of the year for good reason! He does not disappoint. Crispy pig ears were amazing. We also ordered the truffle popcorn; it wasn't awesome. Maybe the popcorn was stale? I'm not sure; had I not ordered it this review would be 5 stars. I really fell in love with this place. My experience was great! I'll be back soon!

Forget about the fact that office is absolutely beautiful. Forget that the staff is so accommodating. Just forget that you're in a clinic all together...   Now, I am not one to go to a Chiropractor! About 15 years ago I had a Chiropractor hurt me pretty bad, and since then, if I even heard someone say they were going to a chiropractor, I was the first to say "Be Careful!"  Well Dr. Luster saved my life yesterday! Seriously. I was in so much pain, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't bend over, I couldn't even drive properly. I was a mess. Ribs out of place, low back pain that wouldn't quit, and neck pain that prevented me from being able to fully rotate (How was I driving in the first place?)  Last night I finally got a decent nights sleep. And today I feel like a million bucks!   Do you hurt? Dr. Luster will make the hurt go away...  I LOVE THIS PLACE! AND I GOT THE BEST ADJUSTMENT EVER!!!!!

My son and I always make time for Mother-Son dinners. Last night, our dining experience went like this... When we walked by this Tratorria style Italian gem, we couldn't help but ask ourselves "Do we want Italian?"  We always ask ourselves this question before we walk into an Italian spot, because most times we are very disappointed. Being Italian you develop a taste for no nonsense GOOD Italian food made with simple, fresh, local ingredients. And the only time you can add the "GOOD" is when it comes out of my kitchen (or Grandma's kitchen). Except this time... WE LOVED THIS PLACE. And that's before we even sat down.  We were greeted immediately and allowed to sit where we chose. The waitstaff was more than helpful when it came to deciding on our Antipasta and Primi.  Our food came out fast, hot and fresh!  The special of the day, Maltagliati -- Pork belly, English peas, parmigiano, was amazing. I caught myself licking my fork over and over (And I was embarrassed when my son pointed it out!) We were full and HAPPY when we left. We can't wait to go back!  PS I love that I am the first to Yelp this place!!

Okay, so its NOT hard to get a great review from me if you are selling me top notch meds for the same price that the other dispensaries are selling shwag... Yes I'm a snob, but its for good reason. I know the benefits to different strains and I shop for specifics. These guys have what I'm looking for. At least they have the three times I have been here.    So you walk in and there is a super cool and friendly greeter who will direct you in the process(if you're a first timer). This dispensary operates differently that the others I've been to, but that's okay. These people know what they have and what it does. This is important.   Did I mention free pre-rolls with an 1/8th purchase. This is no pinner, either. How can you go wrong?!?!  Only thing I wasn't CRAZY about was how they move you through the line... I sort of felt like I was waiting for a government paid doctor to see me. This is so minor that you forget about it by the time you return...   Check out Bloom! An Awesome and professional experience, Period!

I've been here about 5 times and I'm finally going to yelp it! This place is one of my favorite spots to relax. On a Friday, I want to go out to a trendy spot with fresh food! This is the place. In this part of town you can't be sub-par. And Joyride meets the mark! The atmosphere is warm and easy. The staff all have smiles on their faces and everyone seems to be having a great time working. Food is great; despite previous reviews, I never had a bland bite. My shrimp taco had two pieces of over cooked shrimp and the third piece was perfect. Consistency would have been reviewed with 5 stars... I'm still in love with Joyride! In fact, I can't wait to get back!
