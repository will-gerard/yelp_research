Attended a wedding here one night.  If you like the desert plants, this is definitely the place to go.  If you are ever invited to a wedding here, go.  It is just as pretty at night.  Of course, during the Christmas season, you can go at night to see the Luminarias, drink hot chocolate and listen to performers like the thousand other people you will be tripping over.  There are also a few installations of Chihuly art about - very nice to see.  The outdoor venues for weddings are popular, there were three other the night we went, but you would not have known until you got to the parking lot - it is that quiet.  The security staff were very cordial and helpful too.  When an elderly member of our party left their cane in the go-cart rental office, after closing, they were kind enough to not only re-open the office to retrieve the cane, but then gave them a ride to the parking lot in their private security go-carts.  Exceptional!

There are many good things about Costco and very few bad.  Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco.    I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.  I like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great. Anyway, been going here for years and I highly recommend Costco.

mmmmmmm, Lukes.  I've been tempted by other items, but I cannot drag myself away from that Italian Beef.  Wet, with provolone.  sublime.  Their french frys?  These guys really know how to treat a crinkle-cut fry.  Hot, crispy to the tooth, with a creamy potato inside.  A dash of salt.  Damn, now I want to go back.  Do you think they are open at 6:00am on a Sunday?

After quitting Family Practice Specialists because of their stupid policy of charging $50 to access their patient portal, I was without a doctor.  I'm not normally a guy that visits the doctor frequently, however, when you start getting older there are things you need to keep an eye on.  Enter Mountain View Family Physicians.  Googled them, checked out their staff online and on Yelp, they seem to have a solid reputation, even if only after a few reviews.  At least they don't charge to access their patient portal.  I needed to have some tests done, since I am considered a senior at Denny's and I just want to make sure all is well.  Called in, made the appointment.  Come appointment day, I signed in, paid my co-pay and waited.  Maybe 15 minutes before Anne-Marie called me back.  She was pleasant and polite, even joking a bit with me.  She took my vitals, got some history and let me know Dr. Bell would be in shortly.  Cripes, before I could even check-in to Yelp with a comment, the Doc was in the room and disinfecting.  Dr. Bell was cordial, funny and easy to talk with.  I like this guy, we seemed to click right off.  I'm not big on unnecessary medical procedures/medications and we discussed my issues.  He treated me as though I was educated on the issues I might face, and he was correct at that.  He talked to me, and not down to me.  He listened.  He got some more details on my history, set me up for some tests and moved on.  At no time did I feel he was rushing me, in fact, we chatted a bit and it helped me to feel comfortable with a new doctor/clinic.  The front-end staff was a bit cranky, but not overly so - I pretty much expect that with medical administrative people everywhere - I wonder if they have to put that on their application?  Multiple choice - always nice, slightly cranky, full on "why are you bothering me" cranky?  Anyway, I give this place a solid gold 5-stars.  Great people.  I think I have finally found a doctor and staff I can live with.

Hands down, Dr. Bracken is THE. BEST. VET. EVER.  He cares for all of our little critters.  When we are being stupid emotional humans and just have to have our critter in for a look-see, Dr. Bracken is up for it.    He is clearly compassionate and cares about every animal he sees.  His staff is helpful, accommodating and show just as much compassion.  I trust my animals to Arcadia Animal Clinic, you should too.

Don Jose is that place I remember when I reminisce about Mexican food joints from my childhood.  It's not fancy, I don't think they have even one velvet picture of a Bullfighter.  It's an old building, family run using family recipes.  It is good, solid Sonoran style that will satisfy that urge.  I had been working since dawn on this day.  Cutting down a Mulberry tree in my back yard that has become more of a hindrance than a benefit.  I worked with the crew I hired to climb this huge tree and cut it up into pieces.  Most of the trunk was cut up into firewood-sized chunks, which I would split later.  The smaller stuff I loaded onto a flatbed for the trip to the 27th ave Landfill, where it would be turned into mulch.  Waiting in line to enter the landfill, I realized I hadn't eaten all morning.  I was starved.  So was the wife.  After dumping our load, we headed back to the neighborhood.  We had to stop at the bank for cash first, as Don Jose only take cash.  That's a bummer, because if they did credit, I'd prolly come more often.  Anyway, we grabbed some bucks and headed around the corner to Don Jose.  This day they were packed for lunch, with a noisy crowd of revelers in the back.  The dining room is a long, narrow room with booths along the side and tables in the middle.  We quickly found a booth and starting noshing on chips and dip while going over the menu.   I already knew what I wanted, Pollo Fundido.  They do Fundido with chicken, beef or smoked pork, but I was craving that mild chicken flavored with savory spices, deep-fried, then slathered with cream cheese and a delicious blanket of cheddar melted over it all.  The wife ordered a chile rellano.  At Don Jose, this rellano comes with a filling of savory smoked pork, then lightly battered and served with a tasty red sauce.  That Fundido totally hit the spot.  I scarfed it.  The wife doesn't eat pork, so I got to enjoy that smoky-delicious mouthful too.  The refried beans were perfect.  the Iced tea was fresh and cold.  Don Jose, please don't stop doing what you do.

I dream of Harley's.  For me, it is the quintessential expression of American freedom.  You kick that baby over and it roars to life with a sputtering beat.  A growly idle that can be recognized anywhere, muttering leather jackets and tattoos, bandannas and my dirty ol' blue jeans.  My Kawasaki Vulcan (a Harley wannabe) had been sitting idle for some months now, since I purchased Clifford, my new truck.  With the beautiful weather we've been having, the urge to feel the wind in my face called me.  I uncovered the bike and dusted it off, only to find the throttle cables seized.  There is a very specific tool you need to lubricate throttle (and other) cables, and they don't sell them in auto parts stores.  So, I decided to make the 20-mile trip to Ridenow.  Every time I've been to Ridenow, I've been disappointed, and this time was no exception.  Oh, they had the tool, and wanted to sell me a $4 tool for $25.  Of course, they would throw in a can of lube and a fuck-ton of attitude.  Forget it, you people suck.  I left Ridenow thinking back on the days when Cave Creek Road was lined with Bike shops.  You could visit a shop for just about any bike within a mile radius.  Not anymore.  Heading south down Cave Creek Road, I passed the Honda shop, out of business.  Winding around Shadow Mountain, I spy Buddy Stubbs on the right.  It's a Harley shop.  Well, what I needed wasn't specific to any brand and this was a bike shop.  I wheeled in and parked Clifford near the front.  Walking in, this place is expansive.  Harley heaven.  There's a lounge, a clothing store, Harley trinkets galore and bikes.  OMG, I felt like a biker.  Just being there.  They have a museum full of ancient bikes crammed in side-by-side.  Several bikes that Evil Knievel used in his famous jumps.  Electra-Glides, hard-tails, Bobs, all sorts of Harleys.  Oh, but all I wanted was this tool.    I strolled back to the parts desk and was politely greeted by a tattooed man wearing a Harley vest and blue jeans.  The requisite chained wallet hung from his belt.  He had never heard of this tool I spoke of, but he did have an injector that does the same thing.  for $6.  Sold.  Problem!  Credit-card terminal was not working.  Tattoo man was on the horn to IT that fast.  This dude was bending over backwards to sell me a six dollar bottle of lube in a shop with $20+K bikes on the showroom floor.  Harley stuff.  He was the coolest Harley guy I've ever met.  He swore he would get the terminal working and begged my patience.  I wandered about the shop, drooling over these man-machines, starting to think, hmmm, I wonder if they would take a Harley wannabe as a trade in?  Nah, I'm thinking, they'd prolly laugh at me as they chased me out of their Harley world with my tail between my legs.  Sales people were there, and I could feel their eyes on me, but nobody approached me.  It's not hard to sell a Harley, people want them.  They know this, and they leave me to dream.    Parts guy tracks me down, Terminal is working.  He rings me up and I leave, somewhat wistfully, dreaming of what could have been.

This is a man's world. Just like James Brown, -it's a classic.  I'm not one to rave about getting my hair cut, but if you gotta do it, do it right.  Classic does it right.  Walk in, tell them what you want, and they get to work.  The happy-ending is a hot towel and a massage.  I've been going here for about five years now.  The lady barber that did me the last time was telling how she has customers that come from the far ends of the valley to get their hair cut here.  I can believe it.  I typically just walk in as any of the barbers are top-notch, and most have regulars that only go to them.  Me, I'm not that picky, but I do like the service here.  It's fast, efficient and if you can dig the accent, there is great conversation.

They gave me gas.    It is a challenge finding this place, it is little more than a truck parked in a fenced-in commercial yard, located between a new landfill project and the 202.  I went in to get some out-dated BBQ tanks certified for re-use, but found that the cost would exceed the price of a new tank - isn't that just how things work in our disposable world?  anyway, nice guy filled the tanks he could, and gave me some tips on how to recycle the old tanks - take them to home depot and trade them in for one of their refillable tanks.  Kinda feels like cheating to me, so I am stuck with two outdated propane tanks.  Maybe I'll just take them out in the desert and shoot them full of holes then just leave them laying around.  I mean, isn't that what we do with our old, broken down outdated stuff?  Anyway, I digress.  The place is an adventure to find, the gas is cheap and the guy that hangs out in the shipping-container office is a good chap.

It was the MIL's birthday and darn it, she wants her freebie!  She must have spent hours researching restaurants that give treats for your birthday before settling on this one.  Yep, this is one of those times when you take it for the team.  I dropped my wife and her mother at the door, then went to find a parking spot.  When I got back and the four of us formed up in the small waiting room dominated by the elevated podium, the manager greeted us from on high and confirmed that we were complete.  After getting approval, he led us into the kitchen.  Walking your guests through the kitchen is a cute gimmick, but could backfire quickly - like when your guests see garbage on the floors, dirty cutting boards, cluttered with food scraps and cooks standing around looking bored.  This is a vast restaurant with several separate dining areas, all decorated very period schmaltzy Italian with lots of statues, dark fabrics and walls filled with images of I assume, Italian people.  We were led to a booth in a room with a center table filled with 15 teen-aged girls.  Just us and them.  Never mind that the restaurant was practically empty, with plenty of other quieter places, this is where they chose to seat us.  I guess this must have been the 'birthday party room".  Our server was very astute.  She realized before we sat down that we wanted privacy.  Lot's of it, and we didn't want to be bothered with things like ordering our dinner, filling our drinks, delivering our order or checking in on us.  She let us ponder our predicament, unable to converse over the crowd of teens.  Besides, she had her hands full with the table of girls.  Eventually, we got our order in.  We chose to start with a delicious basket of garlic bread, followed with a wilted brown lettuce Caesar salad dusted with Parmesan powder.  It tasted like clorox-soaked spinach.  Moving on to the entree, our choice was a large Chicken Parmesan with a side of pasta and marinara.  I guess in this Italian-style place, your entree that is traditionally served with spaghetti is not.  You have to order it separately.  After allowing our entrees to cool in the kitchen for a bit, she eventually brought them around, dropping them on the table and quickly disappearing, with nary a word.  She had a very hands-off approach to service, which left us plenty of time to wonder what she was up to.  After mucking through dinner, it came time for the big birthday celebration.  A recently-thawed cake.  A candelabra.  A stupid made-up birthday song that the servers were forced to sing.  Who cares.  MIL was happy, she got her free dessert.  On a last note, when you do the birthday thing, there are several expectations.  First you must have a coupon.  Second, you must indicate online when you make a reservation for it.  Then, you must prove it.  This requires your printed coupon, your email reply to your online reservation indicating a birthday and several forms of ID to prove that you actually have a birth date.  Would I go back?  Not a chance, not even for free cake.

You know, the sign of really good pizza is how long the leftovers last in your frig.  For me, a Grimaldi's sausage and pepperoni has never last more than twelve hours.  I know.  It stinks.  I keep promising myself as the server is boxing up the remains of our dinner, I'll have this for lunch tomorrow, it will be so good.  These leftovers never make it to lunch the next day.  Sometimes I wake up at two a.m..  There will be that familiar craving - ok, I'll just go grab one slice, and leave the rest for lunch.  Back to bed.  Up again at five a.m.  Time to get ready for work.  man, I'm hungry.  Scarf.  No more lunch pizza.  Make bologna sandwich for lunch.  Service has always been spot-on, I can honestly say I have never had bad service at this store, and I've been going for years.  My Peroni is always refilled, the food is always perfectly done, and the once or twice a mistake was made, the Manager caught it and brought us a free pie before we even knew there was a problem.  What?  MORE pizza?  Yeah, I"m gonna refuse that.  Great pies, great service, nice ambiance, especially with the courtyard patio.  Prices are compatible with other "high-end" pizza places, but the value is greater.

Came here for brunch on a warm Sunday morning.  Dining in the inner courtyard was a truly pleasant experience.  The Buffet was well-stocked with fruits, pastries and all the breakfast usuals.  Omelet bar?  Check.  Biscuits and gravy?  Back three times.  Okay, so I was a glutton.  But it was delicious and besides, somebody else was paying.  After breakfast, you can scoot right over to the A Mountain trail and hike to the top for a panoramic view of the city, and a chance to work off those three plates of biscuits and gravy.  nom.

Came here to purchase a sport coat because I had to go to a wedding.  Now, if you know me, you know I'm not a suit and tie guy.  I gave up that clown suit and all the BS posturing that goes along with it years ago.    Anyway, I digress.  I was assisted in the Menswear department by a distinguished gentleman who was courteous and helpful.  I wish I could remember his name, he was tall and dark-haired and very polite.  He did not push me straghtaway to the expensive suits, but rather let me look for what appealed to me, then helped me to find jackets that were similar.  I ended up finding one that only had one problem - sleeves too long.  No sweat, he says, and he called up the Seamstress who fitted and measured the coat and assured me she could have it back by Tuesday.  The wedding was on Saturday.  Got the call on Tuesday, ran down there and she fitted the jacket and of course it was perfect!  So, now once again, there is a suit coat hanging in my closet.  Reserved for such esteemed events as graduations, weddings and funerals.  That is if the moths don't get to it first.

Love their thin crust pizza.  Daughter loves their pasta.  Wife loves their salads.  Oh, and they have those crusty little rolls.  Slathered in butter, they are delicious.

I'm no longer such a fan of Cabelas. Oh, their products are generally high-quality and the Cabela's branded products have given me years of great service under tough usage.  I definitely like their products.  Their customer service however, let me see if I can put this delicately - SUCKS!  Here's why:  I received a gift card for Cabela's.  I looked online for a product I've been shopping for a few months now.  I found a great price, $79.99.  It was exactly what I wanted and at a great price.  So, without further ado, I hopped in Clifford (my big red truck) and sped down the interstate on a road-trip to Cabela's.  There were several other items I was considering purchasing, and I thought this was a great opportunity to get some hands-on shopping.    45 minutes later, I arrived in the parking lot and found a shady spot for Clifford.  I've been here before, so I knew right where to go to find the things I wanted.  When I got back to the camping gear area, it looked like the day after a huge sale.  Empty shelves, products in disarray, no clerks around to help.  I found the item I was looking for on the floor next to the wall.  There were three of them, and I just grabbed one and starting shopping for other stuff.  I was looking for a propane stove with a high BTU.  There were cookers, smokers, specialty stoves in about four different areas.  The camp stove shelves were mostly empty and only contained three stoves that met my requirements - note, this is not three models, just three stoves.  I finally chased down a clerk and asked where the stoves were.  He replied, not even looking at me, "did you look over there?  That open area?  that's where our stoves are".  Well, I had in fact, looked over there, and there were no stoves, just big-assed burners, giant griddles and other plus-sized equipment.  I started to reply, but he had already disappeared.  I looked around some more and finally gave up, found the wife and headed to the register.  On the way, the wife said she was looking for a rain suit.  We spotted a Cabela's employee and stopped him, politely asking him to point us to the Rain Suits.  "Rain Suits?  he replied, I have no idea!"  It was time to give up.  Went to the register and paid for my goods.  Later, after I got home, I reviewed the receipt and found they had charged me $99.99 for the item that was advertised as 79.99.  I called the store, was passed off to "customer service" where the phone just rang and rang.  So, I got online with their customer service and oh. my. god.  What a hassle that was.  Yes, now I get it.  They have "Internet Prices", "Online Prices" (I don't know what the difference is) and "Store Prices".  There is no way to tell which is which and what you are paying until you actually have the item in hand.  Trying to get credit for what some might consider "Bait and Switch" tactics is a major hassle.  I have two pages of transcripts from the chat session with their customer service, who finally agreed to send me a $20 gift card to make up the difference.  Cabela's has just been scratched off my list as an outfitter for me.  There are too many other vendors that are physically closer to me and that provide far better customer service.  Beware if you are price/stock checking on their website as they don't tell you if the price is internet/online/store and you are on your best guess as to which it is.

Like others that found Day and Night, I had a bad experience with the company that's always warning me about Melvins.  Seems all they sent out were Melvins.  Anyway, this is about Day and Night, not the other guy and I'll start by saying the difference in quality of service is like day and night.  Recently after Parker and Sons diagnosed my failed A/C, quoting me an incredibly high price to perform work they had done previously, we decided it was time to bite the bullet and put the old machine out of it's misery.  P&S salesperson couldn't be bothered to come visit us to quote, so we started researching.  That's when we found Day and Night.  It really sounded too good to be true and we were skeptical.  Three estimates later, Day and Night won us over with not only the detailed explanation of what caused the failure in the first place (the wrong air filter/bad ductwork design), but what they were going to do to fix it.  Their price to replace our old A/C with a new Trane was comparable to other vendors, but what made the difference was the way everything was explained in detail.  They even found a way to knock $600 off the original estimate after the installation.  All of the employees that I met, and I met a few of them, were cordial, polite and respectful of my space and time.  They did their work quickly, efficiently and carefully.  We are very happy with the A/C installation.  Now today, our second A/C has been having problems.  I called this morning, and Ron was out here this afternoon.  I had a plugged condensation drain.  I explained what I had tried to do to resolve it (thanks youtube!), but I could not find what the root issue was.  Ron diagnosed the problem, the line was actually plugged when I thought I had cleared it, but when I had stucco done last year, they stucco'd right over the drain.  Some debris had built up in the line and not being able to flush out, just started clogging it.  Well, Ron and I worked together to remove the stucco covering the outlet and clear the line.  He is a great technician, easygoing, easy to talk to and easy to work with.  I would not hesitate to have him back for any A/C issues I may encounter.

It's where I go for the stuff I need.  Stylish outdoor clothing, and gear to go along with it.  They have a giant section of boating accessories that pays off when you need to get something like a bilge blower or a bow stop.  The camping gear section is well-appointed with lots of choices for everything from the ground cloth up to the pop-up.  Kayaks, chairs, lanterns, stoves, and all things in-between.  Gun store is like the boat store - shelves and shelves of accessories.  Bass Pro shop is easy to get to, right off the 202 and there are all sorts of dining options around if you, like me, get hungry after looking at all that outdoor gear.  I've never actually eaten in the Bass Pro Shop restaurant, Islamorada, but then I don't eat fish.  I also don't hunt, at least not with guns.  There is a great assortment of camo shirts pants and outfits for hiding oneself in the wilderness.  Combined with the boat shop is a small UTV shop specializing in Arctic Cats.  I can get maintenance stuff as well as maintenance here.  I can also find some great accessories for my cat, so really, I can walk in this place any day of the week and find something I want.  Maybe cannot afford, but definitely want.

So I am backing very carefully out of my parking spot next to her.  I had just walked past the Paradise Valley housewife sitting in her BMW while texting.  She glared at me.  I dunno why, don't much care either.  So, as I back out of the spot, PVH jumps out of her car, shoots me a death-ray glare and runs around to the passenger side, searches for a spot on the door and rubs it vigorously, glaring at me some more.  I roll my window down.  Lady, I didn't touch your car.  YES YOU DID!, she screams, I felt it!  I dunno what you felt, Lady, but it wasn't my 9000 pound truck, you wouldn't be rubbing the door if I hit it.  You hit my car!  I felt it!  Geez, some days you just cannot get away from it.  Yes, this Safeway is popular  with the plastic, silicon and botox-filled 60 year old entitled women trying to be 20 again.  You get the men too, viagra-huffing as they spin in with their top-down corvettes.    Apart from the clientele, this is not a bad Safeway, some parking spots are shaded by well-groomed acacia trees, and usually you can find a decent spot.  Pharmacy is where I fill all my prescriptions, and I like that I can do it online.  A decent selection of organic and vegetarian groceries without the WholeFoods "rapeme" pricing.  Nice deli, good selection of cheeses, wine and spirits.  As usual, the typical Starbucks.  Like the new wing bar - I crave chicken wings at times and I can go crazy at this bar.  The bakery kinda sucks, but all Safeway bakeries suck.

Yes!  As good as it gets!  What a facility!  It did not seem to matter what line I got in, it was always the slowest line.  Waiting in this line, you get to look at the junk other people are getting rid of.  Me, it was tree branches to the composter.  Oh, and before I forget - they have greeters!  Guys stand along the road and wave to you while you drive up.  Very welcoming!  Bring a water bill and a photo ID of the person whom the bill goes to.  Otherwise you have to pay.  Residents can go once a month for free.  Since I went at the end of one month, and I had a lot of tree scraps, I was able to actually make two trips in one week.    The first trip, I got to drive all the way out to where the big shredder machine lives.  They dump organic material here to be shredded.  It was kinda fun, but my Mulberry tree scraps were kinda pokey and scratchy.  Plus, they got all tangled together.  There was a guy showing us where to dump, and afterward he came by with some bendy-pitchfork-dawn-of-the-dead implement.  I'm not sure if he was gonna poke us, but no, he politely offered to let us use this implement of landscaping destruction.  It was good.  The next week was a new month, so I came back with another load.  Earlier this time.  And I got into a different line that was shorter.  As soon as I got in the line with only two trucks in front of me, it stopped moving.  Thirty minutes later, we finally get to the window where the trainee who is being trained tells me I have to deposit $20.  Why?, I ask, it's the same stuff I brought last week for free!  She said, because.  And we will refund it when you leave.  I dunno, maybe they expected me to stay a while and this would cover my parking or something.  When I left I had to wait in another line to get my refund.  I got it all back.  I guess maybe I didn't park long enough or something.  Anyway, it's cool that there is a place that recycles landscaping waste.  I like to give back.

It's an okay place for a morning nap.  I wish the "quiet" room was a bit quieter though.  The day I was there, wireless access was down, so I could not get any real work done.  The movie was some tear-jerker with Ben Affleck.  The place is clean and comfortable.   The staff from the security cops at the front-door to the Jury people were all top-notch.  Efficient, polite, informative, they let you know what is expected without being ugly about it.  I'd go back.  But not until I'm called again.

Tonight's guest performer, DONNY OSMOND!!! (craaaaaaaaahhhhhh!).  Yes, indeed, it was Friday night on the Rez and as we drove up, we watched the blood-red tendrils of a fading sun blazing the clouds over the Estrella's.  Why do I always catch sunsets like this when I cannot get to a camera?  Oh, well, on to the Casino.  No, I was not there to see Donny, but he was the headliner, and in my head that meant I would be battling a horde of seniors to get a seat in the dining hall.  Heck, according to Denny's I am a senior, but these people.  Well, they were up there.  Getting to the Casino was straight-forward, they have their own named exit on the I-10.  We spun in there about 6 pm and quickly found a spot in a garage with estate-sized parking spots.  I'm talking roomy here.  Heck, each spot here would equal two in California.  Swinging our doors wide, we easily exited and headed for the restaurant.  A short stroll and we found ourselves staring at the automatic doors- whoosh! and we are slammed with a wall of stale cigarette smoke floating on the stench of desperation propelled by the fear of losing that next spin on the gambling machines.  It smells just like every other Casino in Arizona and one would think with the billions of revenue they suck from these poor souls they could afford better scrubbers.  We strolled in like the ballers we are and followed the signs around to the restaurant.  Pushing through the crowds of elderly's, we made it to the line in front of what appeared to be the restaurant.  There were bamboo stalks, so we were pretty sure this was it.  We finally got to the host and got our little buzzer.  45 minutes, sir.  We wandered over to the bar and secured a couple of stools, waiting for something to kill the desire to break for the front door and fresh air.  The very busy bartender eventually came around, a husky white man with an Asian hairdo - the little balled-up ponytail in the back.  I think to myself "how fucking cliche."  We order two "Red Lotus".  This is a drink made with Tequila, Ginger Liqueur, Rhubarb Bitters and Fresh Strawberry.  Steven Seagal heads over to the corner and starts playing with his bartender tools, making a big show for the casino-floor waitress while he muddles and shakes and strains our drinks.  Strolling back, he plops two old-fashion glasses partially filled with a vaguely pink liquid in front of us, garnished with a forlorn slice of lime. I'm sorry, he says, I'm out of highball-glasses so I have to use these.  The drinks looked like some kind of shot a frat-boy would order at a sports bar.  Can you at least put some ice in them?, I ask.  Oh, but that would dilute the liquor!  That's okay, I said, at least it would be cold.  The bartender returned with the drinks iced and proceeded to complain about how difficult it was to muddle and strain the fresh strawberries, it was a horrible drink in his opinion as it was too much work.  It didn't taste bad, we slurped them down while watching the other elderly patrons scarf their vaguely Asian looking dishes before the big concert.  90 minutes later, two quick pulses on the pager meant our table was finally ready.  For starters, Steamed Edamame and Black Orchid Ahi "sushi grade" tuna with an Asian slaw and spicy soy mustard.  Close to starvation at this point, we scarfed the apps and waited for our dinners.  The wife ordered the "Evil Jungle Princess" with seared scallops and I had "Drunken" with crispy chicken.  The waitress made a big show of pouring some volatile flaming liquid over my dish tableside, but said that she could not serve it while it was flaming.  So much for show.  My dish could easily be described as "Sweet and Sour Chicken with white rice" in most any other Asian place.  The volatile liquid tasted like rubbing alcohol.  I did not finish this dish, it was too sickly-sweet.  The wife loved her scallops, but left the rest of her dish alone.  We did not ask for doggie bags - that would have just been cruel to our little puggies.  After dinner, we sat and talked while our dishes of uneaten food congealed in front of us.  Summary - Atmosphere lame, I mean like food-court lame, service - overworked Casino people just hoping for their shift to end sooner than later. I give the waitress props, she was not that great, but in her defense, it looked like she was working the whole floor.  Price - not worth it.  Given the attitude and the wait time to get in here, followed by crappy food, I'll pass next and head on over to Pei-Wei for my vaguely Asian food fix.

Nonnie doesn't want Pizza!, my wife texted me.  OMG, this is driving me crazy!  We had a nice dinner planned with the MIL and BIL to visit with him before he shoots back to LA.  Haven't seen Tom in a few months, so it was nice catching up.  The text conversation continues....  They picked "Thai Basil" and dinner is at 6:00 - we will never make it in time!  Whatever, I said.  I've become familiar with the peculiarities of my in-laws and found the best approach is to just go along for the ride, no matter how bumpy.  We hit the 202 around five-thirty, expecting to get jammed up as we headed east.  Arriving at Rural road, it occurs to us that it's also another Grad night at ASU, and the right lane is backed up over the river.  Whatever, I spun past in the left lane.  Arriving at Thai Basil, I have to admit, my expectations were set on low.  My only previous experience with Thai Basil was take-away that was dry and oily and just weird stuff.  We were quickly escorted to a back, partitioned-off area and met the rest of the family.  The dining room is clean and modern, mostly tables and chairs with a tiny bar.  The area we were seated had more of an Asian feel, large, boxy booths with no backs and a thin cushion to sit on.  Iced tea for me and alcohol for the others was quickly brought out and everybody settled in.  For an appetizer, we had the crunchy vegetarian egg-roll.  Nicely sized, a bit larger than a fat, short cigar and tasty with a slightly pungent/sweet dipping sauce.  My daughter explained that you can order your food with a varying spice level 1-5, with 5 being hottest.  She also said that that heat level varied depending on where you were eating.  I played it safe and went with Spicy Noodles with Chicken at a level 3.  The wife had some sort of dish with giant scallops in it.  BIL had a seafood curry and I cannot remember the rest.  The meals arrived quickly, although not all at the same time, we had to wait a bit for the wife's dinner.  Spicy noodles was delicious.  Bite-sized chunks of chicken, mixed with a variety of crispy veggies - nicely done broccoli and other stuff.  Very tasty, I scarfed the plate.  Iced tea was fresh.  Wife loved her dish and boxed up about half of it to take home for a couple more meals.    No complaints on the meals, portions were large and service was attentive without hovering.  Ambiance was really nice - quiet enough that we could actually have a conversation with each other.  Most importantly, Nonnie was happy, she got her family dinner with family togetherness.

My Kawasaki Vulcan (a Harley wannabe) had been sitting idle for some months now, since I purchased Clifford, my new truck.  With the beautiful weather we've been having, the urge to feel the wind in my face called me.  I uncovered the bike and dusted it off, only to find the throttle cables seized.  There is a very specific tool you need to lubricate throttle (and other) cables, and they don't sell them in auto parts stores.  So, I decided to make the 20-mile trip to Ridenow.    Every time I've been to Ridenow, I've been disappointed, and this time was no exception.  From the first time they screwed me on a used ATV to each time I have come in afterwards for parts.  Don't even get near the new machines, sales people will circle like buzzards and try to eat you alive.  It was so bad that I would drive from Arcadia to Avondale to get my ATV worked on, just to avoid going to Ridenow.  This time, I figured, I'd just stop in and see if they have the tool I needed. This was not a tool specific to the machines they sell, but a generic motorcycle tool for the home mechanic. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of bike shops in Arcadia, so I have to sometimes suck it up.  So, sucking it up, I walked in to find what I needed.   Oh, they had the tool, alright, and wanted to sell me a $4 tool for $25.  Of course, they would throw in a can of lube and a fuck-ton of attitude.  I don't get the attitude.  You are already trying to rape me on rides, tools and parts, and now you want to cop an attitude too?  Forget it, you people suck.  I"m not letting you gouge me again.  I left and drove to the Harley shop south of here on Cave Creek Road.  They don't have attitude there.  They do have what I needed.  For $6.  Guess I'll be going to the Harley shop from now on.

BEWARE!  Airpark Dodge is going to charge you premium prices for service.  I would say service delivery is fairly typical for a dealership, and I gotta give a shoutout to the SA assigned to me.  Brett is personable, friendly and on top of his game.  Too bad he works for a dealership that has absolutely no problem with making him look bad.  Don't misunderstand where I'm coming from - Brett is a stellar Service Advisor.  I brought my truck in for warranty work.  The windshield sprayer just stopped working.  I typically will research this kind of thing and if it's relatively easy, I will fix it myself, however, I've got to get some value from that extended warranty they stuck into the deal.  So anyway, my after the fact research tells me that the parts for this repair can be purchased retail for around $30.  The fix is not that difficult, basically unplugging an electrical pump component, and from what was described to me, installing a completely new tubing and sprayer assembly.  Since I was there for warranty work, about an hour after arriving, Brett informs me the pump is covered by warranty and they should be wrapping up in about 45 minutes.  Cool.  Back to Solitaire.  About 30 minutes later Brett returns.  Bad news.  Apparently, the plastic feeder tubing has a split and must be replaced.  Of course, in our throwaway society, this means the entire assembly must be replaced, all the way to the sprayer nozzles - and worse yet, not covered by warranty.  More bad news to come later.  I figure, what the hell, I'm already here, they are under the hood and so I approved this repair.  I'm guessing at this point they were counting on that response.  About 20 minutes later, Brett rings me up.  $172.67.  For what amounts to some plastic hose and sprayer nozzles.  Parts that can be purchased online for less than $20.  So, apparently, labor here runs around $150 an hour, with an hour minimum.  I am far less concerned about the warranty not covering the complete system when it fails than I am with Airpark Dodge Chrysler Jeep sticking it to me on what is a minor repair that I could have done myself.  But I guess I really should not be surprised as they stopped doing courtesy washes last year - somebody told me "to save the environment", I said back, "recycled water".    Lesson learned.  I looked at the $172 work they did and to be honest, the tubing looks just like the tubing that was there before.  I'm not saying they did not replace it, I'm just saying I looked at it before they did the work and after they did the work.  Difference:  new sprayer nozzles, new pump.  Couldn't tell that anything was done to the tubing.   In the future, I'm calling my trusted mechanic before I even consider talking to Airpark.  I will also be checking out who else can perform this warranty work, because clearly Airpark uses it to suck your wallet dry.  Would I buy another vehicle from Airpark?  Methinks not.  p.s. Sorry Brett.  Not your fault your employer likes to shank it's customers.

Consider that I am hardly an expert on commuter trains/subways/metro rails, whatever you want to call them.  So I speak from the experiences of a dilettante railfan.   Whatever, the light rail has always been a spot-on solution for me.  I've always utilized it less as a commuter and more of an easy way to get to downtown Tempe without having to deal with the hassles of traffic and parking.  I typically will park in the park and ride lot at 38th and Washington, then ride the rails a few miles into the downtown or Veterans stations to access venues in Tempe.  While you certainly see some interesting characters on the rails, I'm just there for the ride.  The cars are large, well-appointed and quiet.   The only real downside I experienced was the advertising wrap on the outside of the car prevented me from seeing outside into the night very well.  Apart from that, parking was easy and relatively safe, as was access to the metro and timing of stops.

The Grind has grown into a nice little neighborhood bar.  Often, the wife and I will walk over there for a burger, fries and a tasty microbrew.  It's never too crowded, service is great and the food is pretty darn good.  They've expanded the menu over the years and perhaps next time I will try the wings.

I highly recommend these guys.  They arrive when they say they will and if they are going to be late, they call you and let you know.  I needed to get three windows repaired.  Two of them they banged out quickly and professionally.  The other was a dual-pane in a door that is pretty much considered an antique - heck, it's only 40 years old.  Anyway, because of the design of the door, they were unable to replace the window.  Did they charge me for the window they built to put in the door?  Heck no.  Not only that, but they gave me some leads on the manufacturer and some tips on what I can do to solve that problem.  Oh, and unlike another window company that was recommended to me, they came out and did estimates on all the windows, free of charge.  Their technicians were all polite, professional, courteous and hard workers.  Rem A D - You guys rock.

Horrible customer service.  Contacted them via email for a quote.  Was directed to some surly guy that could hardly be bothered to help me.  After some discussion he tells me the best thing he can do is send out somebody to look at my windows.  For a fee.   Never mind "Best" Glass, sorry to have bothered you.  Ever hear of Rem A D Window Repair?  You should look them up and ask them if they can teach you about customer service.  They just might.  For a fee.

I like O.H.S.O.  really.  I just hate restaurants that have zero sound insulation.  Concrete ceilings.  That's what you get here.  Block walls.  What does that have to do with the food, you ask.  Well, that's a good question.  I'm glad you asked the question in writing, because at O.H.S.O., I would have asked you to repeat the question.  Maybe a couple of times.  Yes, I am hearing impaired.  The result of growing up in the Seventies with a crappy walkman, earbuds jammed in my ears and Supertramp playing as loud as it would go (before it started distorting), while I scoured the walls of the nearest skatepark or empty backyard pool.  Normal, hearing people don't have a clue what a challenge it is to carry on a normal conversation in a place like this.  It was  a rainy Sunday, and a late lunch with a few beers and friends.  We had hoped to ride our bikes down the canal to this place, and enjoy the afternoon on their patio.  Alas, that was not to be, as mother nature decided to create a downpour that scared the people at O.H.S.O. enough to close the patio.  Everybody inside!  The cacaphony inside was like standing at the base of Niagara Falls and trying to carry on a conversation.  Normal hearing people maybe.  Me, just a painful roar, despite having my hearing aids tuned for the environment.  I had a salad of romaine wedges, one end covered in crumbled blue cheese, bacon bits and some other stuff.  It was actually pretty good.  While eating this salad, I enjoyed an Arizona Trail Ale from That Brewery.  A tasty beer at 6.0%ABV.  Hearty flavor without being overpowering on any notes.  I had a second.  It was good.  This place has a really cool bicycle vibe, all decorated artistically with various parts of and whole bicycles.  They are dog-friendly outside, with free treats made from the spent beer grains for your fidos.  The service is so-so, depending on how busy they are.  Other things on the menu are pretty tasty as well and I've enjoyed the beer brunch on the weekends.  I noticed on Sunday afternoons they are now having a BBQ.  This seems like something I want to try.  When I can sit outside.

Yes, I am a fan of their pizza.  It is awesome, fast and reasonably priced.  However, their sales tactics leave something to be desired.  Just know that going in, you will be pestered to add cookies and appetizers to your meal, and don't forget to register your mobile so you can enjoy the frequent spam.  I've been a regular customer for about a year now, and I highly recommend the spicy butcher, a deliciously spicy pie that is perfect for one for lunch.  This pie starts on either white or wheat thin crust, then gets dressed with a spicy tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni and peperoncini.  I always ask to add black olives and extra cheese and have never been disappointed.  If you do opt for appetizers, I recommend the garlic knots, surprisingly delicious.

Visited again recently with my wife.  As usual, we had a wonderful lunch, and this one was so much better as the service has improved substantially, and is not so pushy with the add-ons like cookies and ice cream.  Good Form, my Pie!

Yes, Ingo's is tasty.  Ingo's is also pricey.  Portions are small and beer is expensive - an eight ounce glass of Sculpin IPA will set you back $7.  I had the chicken sandwich "Adam and Eve" style, which is sans bread.  The sandwich was tasty but small.  Had chips on the side, - they do a great job with the chips.  Service was lackluster, and here is what kills a star for me.  They use the mobile devices to run your card right at the table, then the tip amounts are automatically calculated, so you cannot decide what amount to give apart from their pre-set tip amounts.  Doing this while the server is standing over you is uncomfortable - especially when the service was as bad as it was.  Despite that Ingo's is a short walk from home, I think I'll pass in the future.

Toffee Banofi.  That says it all.  I will skip dinner just so I can gorge on this delicious, cool, buttery, sugary mess.  This is ice cream that will make you forget all other ice creams.  You might as well forget your diet as well.  But then, if you come here, you are already waffling.  Yes, it's pricy.  But worth it.  well worth it.  Service with a smile, staff that seem to enjoy what they are doing and oh, Toffee Banofi.

This ain't yer old-school driving range. Remember back then?  You pay a few bucks, get a bucket of balls and head out to the line with all the other duffers.  You bang your bucket of balls out on the range, trying your best to hit the kid in the cart collecting the balls.  You never really know where your ball went, watching the 50 balls flying out there at the same time could get confusing.  Driving range, meet the 21st century.  It's all computerized.  There are actual targets that score your shots for you.  There's a bar.  There is food.  You are in the shade and on either side of you is a flat-panel playing whatever game is on at the moment.  Can practicing get any better?  You purchase a membership card that allows you to register when you play and track your shots.  There are clubs for all sorts of shots, men, women, left or right available.  Food/drink servers coming by with a menu.  You pay by the hour and as long as you keep swinging, the computer-machine keeps spitting out balls and tracking your performance for you.  Don't worry about it.  Get thirsty? Full drink menu.  Hungry?  Great appetizers.  I tried the Chicken wings three ways, BBQ, Buffalo and Asian Sesame.  Comes with dipping sauce and veggies.  Wings were crispy and tasty.  Next, we had the Chips with Guac and Nacho Cheese Sauce.  Chips were out of a bag, but they kept us supplied.  The Nacho sauce was okay, the Guac was fresh and delicious, the salsa plain and boring.  We golfed for a couple of hours and had a blast.  The building is three levels, all brick and glass, there are free video games if you are waiting for a spot,  and the restrooms are clean.  I'm not a golfer, but I would say Topgolf rocks.

What a refreshing place.  Clean, friendly staff, delicious fresh made, organic good for you drinks.  My favorite is "the buzz", a tasty mix of carrot, lemon, ginger and other stuff, it will "pump you up".    My girls love the Acai bowls and make a healthy meal out of them.  They have drinks in a case, or fresh-made.  Whatever you get, I'm sure you will enjoy.

I'm heading out of town to explore the desert.  I don't have time to stop for dinner, I've got to meet people on the road.  Super Oscars is right on the way, so I swing in.  As the only customer in line, it takes the cashier chick a few minutes to locate me waiting patiently at her counter.  "I'll have a Chicken Burrito and a Bean and Cheese Burrito - to go, please".  She looks at me.  "You want shredded chicken with that?; "yeah, sure", I say, "however you make it".  She rings me up.  I thought it was really cheap at less than seven dollars, but I had other things on my mind.  Five or so minutes later, my order is ready.  I look in the bag, there's only one burrito in it.  "Excuse me", I say, as she had already wandered off. "I should have two burritos?"  No, she says, you ordered chicken and bean burrito, staring at me with a vacant expression.  I give her an exasperated look - "whatever, I don't have time for this."  grabbed my burrito and left.  The bean burrito was supposed to be my lunch for the next day.  The burrito I got with chicken, beans and cheese was a hefty sucker and did not taste all that bad.  Of course, I would have preferred what I ordered, and the next day, in the middle of the desert, I missed that bean burrito.  My advice, make sure the vacant chick repeats your order back.  Check your receipt to make sure she rings it up right.  Or, go someplace else with better ratings and decent service.

Out of milk at 7:30???  With a yogurt shop 25 yards away?   The burger was decent though.  Typically airport service, typically airport prices. No milkshake for me tonight.

Good thing I ordered extra mayo on my sub, I might not have got any at all.  Prices are a bit high compared to the quantity of product delivered, unless you consider lettuce as a primary ingredient in an Italian meats sandwich.  The amount of meat on the sandwich was barely noticeable as was the flavor of the meats.   Delivery was slow, it took about 15 minutes to get my sub, there were only three people ahead of me and four or five people behind the counter making sandwiches - don't break out of the "system" - they have a system for a reason!  I was really not impressed, the sandwich was filling and while I did not partake the computerized beverage/ice dispenser had a lot of options for mixing your soft drinks.  Unfortunately, I don't drink soft drinks, so I had to wait for the young woman in front of me to decide which flavor combination she wanted before I could get my ice.  She was having difficulty, maybe there are too many options?  Or maybe the ice dispenser should be a separate device?  On a positive note, the tea was fresh, although not freshly brewed.

Finally.  I was in the neighborhood after catching a movie.  It was kinda late for them on a Sunday, they close at eight and we arrived just after seven.  We still got the welcome smiles, though.  While at the theater, I was perusing Yelp to figure out what to eat for dinner.  I remembered all the hoopla over Lobby's/Johnny's and how just about everybody on the planet raved about them.  How come only 50 some-odd reviews then?  Anyway, some of my most trusted reviewers popped to the top of the list, and to a person, gave a five-star review.  Maybe I'm just a little pickier, but while really good, I was not wowed enough for five stars.  Love the hand-formed burger patty.  Fresh veggies on the burger and the cheeseburger comes with Cheddar.  I wasn't asked how my burger should be cooked, but hey, I can see it would be tough to cook one of these burgers med-rare.  The wife had a plain burger and I had a cheeseburger.  I would come back just for the burgers, and maybe try some of the add-ins, like bacon (swoon), jalapenos, and other stuff.  What really attracted me were the crinkle-cut fries.  Cooked properly, they should remain crispy on the outside, and creamy-soft on the inside.  Johnny's does them proud, I would come back just for the fries.  The burgers were delicious, however, in my case, they lacked seasoning, which was remedied by the salt/pepper offered at the condiment station.  I also had a strawberry shake.  I love strawberry shakes.  Johnny's does too, judging from this shake.  I would come back just for this shake.  So, I guess what I am saying is, cost is reasonable, food is delicious and a great value.  I would come back for this ish.

Well, I gave them a second try.  12:00 on a weekday and they were practically empty.  Uh-oh.  I had a slice of pepperoni and an Italian Beef.  When I ordered it "wet", I got this weird look.  It took them about 15 minutes to put this together.  The pizza was dry and tasteless.  A New Yorker buddy insists that good New York pizza should have grease running out of the corner when you fold the slice.  This one was dry.  Oh, I said that :-)  Crusty too.  a couple slices of pepperoni stuck to the dry sauce.  The Italian Beef was so-so.  Completely dry, but there was a little cup of jus to dip it in. Covered in giardineira, it was hot, but small for the price.  I cannot imagine anyone serving Italian Beef and not knowing how it is served.

This was a major crisis.  In a city of over two million people, with at least 1 24-hour convenience store, the Smashburger in Terminal 4 was unable to secure any milk at 7:00pm on an Wednesday.  Where was the TSA?  What were they doing about this?  I dunno.  The bored airport smashburger chick with the ring in her nose didn't really seem to care.  The terminal, in it's vast indifference to my crisis, hummed along.  There were planes to catch, people to meet and baggage to be tossed about.  The ebb and flow of people going hither and to continued, unabated, uncaring that I was unable to secure a strawberry shake at this vendor.  I hate flying.  it makes me feel like I'm back in basic training - hurry up and wait in the next line, nobody really giving a shit about you because you are just another number.  In the end, you get crammed into a tiny space with a bunch of smelly people.  Terminals like this one help though.  It's big, roomy with lots of escalators and people movers.  Tile and Glass, Art exhibits for those times when you've hurried, but now you are waiting.  Lots of food places representing a microcosm of fast-food America and local places.  Except for Smashburger.  They were out of milk.  Nobody knew what to do, nobody cared.  I ordered a smashburger and waited the ten minutes, watching the guy ahead of me leave with a giant bag containing other bags of food.  Perhaps to go find a corner in this vast mall, where he could relieve his Smashburger fix in quiet loneliness.  Access is easy, parking is easy (and expensive), and Terminal 4 hums along, 24 hours a day, people in, people out.

Stopped in for a late lunch.  Okay, so it was like 45 minutes before they close.  I should have known better.  I ordered the BLTE, which is supposed to be a Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato sandwich with a fried egg added.  I would think that on a sandwich like this, the Bacon would be the star, but alas this was not to be.  What little bacon that was on the sandwich, maybe a slice and a half, was burnt black and crisp, it kinda looked like they dredged it up from the bottom of somewhere just so they could get back to closing down the line (45 minutes early).  The rest of the sandwich was great - the egg was fried perfectly, cheese was all melted and apart from the disappointing bacon, not a bad sandwich.  I"m sorry I bothered them so late in the day.  I learned my lesson.  I'll be back, but only for breakfast.  Addendum:  Hi Eleni, thank you for your reply.  I'd just like to let you know that I most certainly know the difference between smoked (dark) meat, and greasy, bottom of the bin leftover bacon.  I"m sorry I neglected to take any photos, that would have shown everybody what it looked like.  OTOH, maybe that is a good thing for you.  I've been a customer of First Watch on and off for over twenty years, at different locations, of course, but I will say this is the first time I came for lunch.

Having waited as long as I could for the opening jitters to clear and for Frasher's to dial things in, I think I timed it perfectly.  A quiet Monday lunch, I was there five minutes after opening, so I could be sure to get everything I wanted.  We were greeted with a smile as we perused the menu.  They've got Brisket, Chicken, Turkey, Burnt Ends and some other stuff.  Sorry, I just homed in on what I was hungry for.  It was tough to decide, so we spread it out.  Everything is sold by the pound which makes it easier to order different items, like you are not stuck with a half-pound of something when you want to try other things.  The meats (except chicken wings) come dry, and they provide squirt bottles of a sweet and a hot bbq sauce.  I tried the hot and it was awesome.  Not really hot, but very tasty.  They got my vote.  The brisket has just enough chew to it so that it does not fall apart all over the place, The burnt ends are a tasty treat and the chicken wings are large and freshly-cooked, slathered with a mild hot sauce they are actually "finger-licking good"  We also had the green-chile mac which sported a very mild green-chile flavor and was a bit thick.  I prefer my mac a bit creamier, but I can live with this version.  The only real problem I had was that they served our dishes in takeaway containers.  Which would be okay if we were actually ordering to go.  We were dining in and it was difficult to grab the brisket sandwich out of the tight-fitting container.  I would suggest that they provide plates for dine-in customers.

It was Friday night and we were hungry.  What to do?  Where to go?  We live in a fantastic neighborhood with several great places within walking distance - The Grind, North, Rustic Pizza, LGO/Ingo's, Chelsea's kitchen - with their awesome patio.  It was all getting so rote though.  We wanted something different.  Daughter suggests Sushiholic.  Now, I am not a fish eater, and I have allergic reactions to shellfish, so this would not have been my first choice.  However, the ladies convinced me that there would be stuff I would enjoy.  They were so right.  We walked over around 7pm and they were packed. Waiting a mere 15 minutes while we studied the extensive menu of fishy things and other stuff, we finally got a table.  Right off, the atmosphere took me back too many years to admit, to my days sitting at a bar on the Honch,  The only thing missing was The Eagles, Hotel California - which at the time appeared to be on every jukebox in every bar in every town in Japan.  Anyway, I ordered a Kirin Ichiban and Galbi short ribs.  The ladies had some fish sorta-thing with rice and ginger and wasabi.  Soon my bottle of Kirin arrived, accompanied by a glass with an Asahi label.  Bad form, but the waittress claimed that's all they had, personally, I don't think she understood basic beer etiquette.  Anyway, the beer was cold and tasty despite the wrong glass :-).  The platter of ribs arrived sizzling on a bed of grilled onions.  We scarfed it quickly.  The ribs were okay, kinda chewy, but flavorful.  Surprisingly, the onions were tasty as well, and the platter  was soon cleared.  The waitress was summoned back so we could order dinner.  For me, that meant another bottle of Kirin, some Gyoza , which are pork dumplings and a big bowl of Tonkatsu Ramen.  The ladies ordered more fishy stuff.  The Ramen was a giant bowl of awesome noodles, again bringing back memories of post-party Ramen slurping on the Honch.  This soup was a flavorful broth of hard-boiled egg, radish, sliced pork and other stuff.  It was quite tasty, and large.  Dropping the dumplings in like wontons created a meal that was too much for even me.  I sadly left at least a third of the broth, I just could not slurp anymore.  The ladies really enjoyed their fishy stuff too.  Service was good, prices reasonable and the food quite tasty.  It's kinda weird, but the unisex bathrooms were super-cool.  One is like a mini-lounge, clean enough that you could have a private party in there.

You cannot just go through this store and not buy something.  I mean everybody needs to get organized, and you will find your stuff here.  From shipping boxes to storage boxes, kitchen containers to shoe boxes.  They have quite an assortment of shelving units from wall racks to wire racks.  This place is cool and you will not leave without something.  At least I cannot.

It's okay.  It's the current fad in pizza concepts, where you pay one price and you can put anything you want on the pie.  It's been done.  MOD does it too.  The only real criticism I have is the crust.  I dunno.  tastes like cardboard to me.  But they do have great local microbrews on tap.  Sorta makes you forget the crust.

Wait?  Did I say something about the crust?  I dunno, but that Santan Devils Ale out of the tap is a great tasting beer.  Getting a pitcher to go with your pie is the way to go.  But only if you are not the DD.

It was just okay for me.  Stopped in for a burger with the wife.  She had the Alice Cooper burger med-well and I had the house burger with bacon and cheese, med-rare.  Ordered up some limp fries to go  with it.  Oh and a couple of micro-brews.  Beers were awesome.  Ambiance was typical happy hour.  I like that when they take your order, they give you a table assignment - this way you don't have to mill around like a scavenger looking for the first opportunity.  We drew the two-top right between the bar and the soda fountain.  The noise level here was moderate, and we got to watch all the orders going out.  Burgers, on the other hand, were nothing to brag about.  My wife's med-well burger came out with a thin strip of raw burger down the middle, mine came out so well-done it would have made a good hockey-puck. The bacon was a couple of limp pieces - not even a full strip, just a couple of pieces.  Oh, and did I say limp?  Much like the limp fries.  The Brioche was fresh and tasty, as were the veggies.  Service is spotty at best, you place your order, they assign you a table and eventually somebody comes around and introduces themselves as your server.  Then somebody different delivers your drink.  Yet another person brings out the food.  The person introduced as our server?  She did return, but only to drop off the check.  We hoped she would check back before our burgers got cold so we could discuss the med-rare/med-well  thing, but that was not to happen.  Finally, we just threw in the towel and swapped patties, after I had consumed half of my puck.    I'm not sure this place is worth a second visit.  I suppose if you like well-done burgers, tiny pieces of limp bacon and fries that are weak at the knees on a good day, then Hopdoddy's is the place for you.  But hey, the beer was good.
