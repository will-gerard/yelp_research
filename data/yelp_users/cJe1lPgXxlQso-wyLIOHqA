I judge breakfast restaurants by their fruit cup because it's a staple of breakfast and often the item that gets the shaft in the food industry. Theirs was an interesting combo of meh. It had  strawberries  and yummy watermelon, but unripe melons (the staple of any fruit cup). I'm always sad when there isn't pineapple.   The whole wheat pancakes and potatoes were great!! Service was pretty good.  Overall, the experience was better than average but not amazing. I like how the set up is all inclusive however. The table had all the condiments, creamer, sauces and jellies you could imagine before you've even ordered.

For the record; I LOVE Nello's Pizza. Particularly their pepperoni pineapple pizza. However, this location has disappointed me twice now, which is extra sad as I just moved nearby. The service has been mediocre at best. They maybe check on my table twice before asking if we are ready for the check. The first time I was there, they were out of every drink I asked for. No hot coffee, zero bags for hot tea, but the waiter was nice enough -although he seemed higher up than a waiter as he kept stating things like "oh no I haven't had tea here in ages." "No I don't think I carry that right now." Cool. Then to top that experience off, for the 1st time ever, I didn't enjoy my pizza. It seemed kinda....not old...but certainly not freshly made. Finally, last night's experience was fine but again our waitress checked on us once to refill our drinks and that's it. I tried something new and was disappointed with my selection: the spaghetti and meat sauce (a family recipe, according to the menu). I once heard that Americans make spaghetti all wrong because we focus all about the sauce when it should be all about the noodle. This dish proved that. There was so much sauce and tomato clumps, I could hardly find any spaghetti. And this wouldn't have been so bad if the sauce was something special but it was really quite bare of seasonings.   I'll probably be visiting the Mesa location from now on.

I love this place. It's in a little corner on Apache but big in heart.   The food isn't just for vegetarians or "green" people. There is chicken, fish, etc. The fruit fantasia platter is delicious for breakfast. My favorite dinner meal is the mahi mahi with humus. The service is always really attentive and polite.   This location is decorated with original artwork that really compliments the atmosphere. It's just a great, cozy place to chat with people with delicious foods.

Very good service. We happened to go in on a slow part of the day and my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant, which usually results in being ignored in smaller places. But instead, everyone jumped up to serve us and was very polite. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is very comfortable.

If you want a chill, relaxed place to hang out, go here. You can sit inside or out. There's recorded music inside and often a live performer or DJ outside. The food is always tasty even if it's just typical bar food, and the service very good. Everyone is super nice there.

Despite all flowers being depicted online as neatly prepared in a decorated vase, all flowers were delivered "in the vase" without water, in a black box. Not very romantic. Also, none of the lilacs were bloomed until several days later, which then they were gorgeous but beforehand just looked a little sad. When I called the manager, there was no apology or sincerity expressed, just "that's how they come." I would expect a flower company to understand presentation more than anyone. Perhaps not.

My favorite place for delicious treats of italian taste. I can't get enough of the antipasta plate or their sangrias. I only had a bad server one time out of the dozen times I've gone.

This breakfast visit stood out to me the other day for this main reason: curtousy. I walked in with a group of 10 people. We were greeted upon entering and when we asked if they could make room for a party that big, they responded, Absolutely! Just give us two minutes! They probably did it in less. The waitresses were patient with our crowd who were a little indecisive with our orders, always had water and juice refilled quickly. Also, the waitress was thoughtful when I wanted just one pancake to go with my omlette, she suggested the kids pancakes because the regular size would be rather large. Then the kids pancakes came in the shape of mickey mouse heads. Yaya! Also, their food is always delicious.

I was really excited to try a fun workout routine that would also do some damage. I showed up with a friend and two other girls who had made a reservation like the groupon specified. Well imagine our surprise when the trainer wasn't there. We made contact with him and he said to ask another trainer to get us started and he would be there soon.  You should know now, that he never showed up. Secondly, the other trainer is technically a part of anther company that shares the garage. So the poor guy was stuck with clients that didn't even pay for his services. But he was willing to keep us busy with running drills, a little weights and such, but nothing boxing related. (again not his fault) he was great. But I definitely returned my groupon because the 1on1 boxing instructor definitely didn't bother to honor his own conditions. I even called him the next day to confirm that he would be there and he said of course he would. So I mentioned that I was a part of the group from that morning when he didn't show up and he said "oh...well you were trained by (other trainers name)." I thought that was a poor excuse.

I loved this place when I checked it out a year ago and I love it even more now that I've seen they've made improvements. I went dancing there quite some time ago and the air circulation was nonexistent so it was impossible not to get overheated but last night (April '14) I never thought twice about the temperature and I danced to their sweet swinging tunes all night long. Swing nights are probably my new favorite night of the week. The only reason that I didn't give them a 5 star review was that I was a little concerned about their bar tender. She was nice and made good drinks (freaking delicious actually) but she was very slow at making just two drinks and she used her hands to handle all of the ingredients. Like, tipped the jar of blueberries into her hand to put them in my drink. Don't bartenders typically use those spears to out that stuff in? It just seemed a little bit of excessive touching of something I'm going to be drinking.

I almost wanted to give it a 3 star rating but that's only because it's my first time here so the originality of the environment is very intriguing. However, the food is mediocre and the service is less than. Very well intentioned staff but they need to get their act together. Slow seating despite plenty of open tables. Nice waiter but long wait for the food, drink refills and check ups.

This is my new favorite dinner spot! Awesome decor and atmosphere. Funky music and lively mood. Very well informed waiters. They were all willing to answer questions and take our order when we were ready. To quote my fav waiter, Jet: the food is "magic in your mouth" and he isn't exaggerating. The Big Star pizza and the veggie platter were delicious. They're not messing around in their kitchen.

I felt so conflicted about this place even half way through my appointment. At first, it seemed great. My friends and i came with a groupon for a mani/pedi. We had two people for each of us but had a few issues. One friend had to repeatedly ask for more glitter coats because they put the bare minimum on her hands and feet. She also forgot a nail entirely until she was reminded. Whenever we asked for something, they would increasingly become more rude and roll their eyes. My lady wasn't very meticulous either. She threw on the clear top coat without much care to cover the whole nail. when my pedi was done, I saw that the underside of multiples toes had nail polish on them.   The women were all bluntly rude. The men were kind and smiled a lot but also didn't speak much English at all.   I wish I'd just gone to my usual place. Groupon or no groupon.
