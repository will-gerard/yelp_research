Best Mexican food in Phoenix hands down! This place is one of my weekly lunch go to's. They have great lunch combination specials and every person gets soup to start. The hot sauce is hot hot hot, but so delicious! It gets pretty busy during the week for lunch, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes if you are going during peak times.

Maybe I am just spoiled with good Mexican food growing up in San Diego, but this plus is sub par at best. Flavor was lacking, food didn't seem that fresh and the salsa wasn't that great either. I really wanted to like it because it is so close to my house, but there was nothing special about it. :(

Not what you would expect for a $150+ meal for two. For an "upscale" steakhouse the food and service were nothing great. First, we never got the bread our server said would be right out when we arrived. We proceeded to ask for it two additional times before it was finally brought to us when we received our entree. The halibut was ok, but over cooked and the sauce on top was over bearing. The calamari was decent, but I have definitely had better. I also wish they put whatever sauce they had on it on the side so they breaded part stayed crispy. The only saving grace of the meal were the Fleming's potatoes. They were delicious. I doubt I would ever find myself back here, but if I did I would get the potatoes. Lastly, its not necessary to ask every time you refill water/ice tea, just fill it up and if I am not thirsty anymore I won't drink it and thus you won't refill it.   If you are looking for a delicious meal with great service this is not the place for you. My personal favorite in the valley is Mastro's City Hall - you will not leave disappointed.

DELICIOUS is the word that comes to mind! Great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Not a sit down service restaurant -you order at the counter and they bring out your food. Sometimes the line can be quite long, but it goes fast and it is worth the wait. If you want something to hold you over grab a cup of coffee at their espresso bar before you get in line.   I don't eat meat, but I have heard from friends the meatball sub is amazing! A few of my personal favorites are the vegetarian pizza, the breakfast burrito & the egg salad sandwich.   If its a nice day, request a seat on their outdoor patio!

Not being a meat eater it is hard to find a good sandwich place, but Sacks Impressionist (Veggie) is one of my favorites. It comes fully loaded and with lots of options. And if i'm feeling a little fishy, both their tuna salad and tuna sandwich are other go to items. I am usually pretty picky about my tuna, but Sacks is fresh and not smothered in mayonnaise.   This is a great spot to call in a pick up lunch on the go.

Looking for Italian in Chandler? This is the place to go! We have been here more times than I can count.   Highlights: -Great for small groups or an intimate date night.  -Calamari is a must. Lightly breaded with garlic marinara sauce -Gnocchi, Ravioli & Margarita pizza are some favorites -Reservations recommended on a Friday or Saturday.

Four Peaks is one of my GO TO places in Tempe. Atmosphere is laid back, local delicious beers and wonderful food. Great restaurant for any occasion- birthdays, groups, football Sunday, laid back date night.  Sunday brunch is a must. The food is amazing and they have the best bloody mary in town.  Personal Favorites: Beer: Hop Knot or Pumpkin Porter in October  Food: Salmon BLT, no bacon add avocado, Portabella Beer Bread, Cheese Enchiladas Sunday Brunch: Breakfast Beer Bread or the Enchiladas and Eggs

Cibo is a go to for delicious sandwiches and pizza! The saltimbocca bread is perfectly baked and so fresh. It is a cute little restaurant in an old Phoenix house with a great patio to enjoy your meal on if it is a nice day/evening.   Personal favorites: Alla Parmigana, Caprese & Tonno Sandwiches  Only minor thing I would have to say is on a busy day sometimes service feels understaffed. It may take a little bit to get drink refills etc. But that was only if I was being super critical, usually it is great!

PERFECTION is the only word to describe City Hall! From the atmosphere, to the incredible service, to the delicious food everything is always perfect!   Although I don't eat meat people I have been here with have said it is the best filet they have ever had. My personal favorite -- the Ahi Tuna. The portion is huge and the fish is super fresh! For the sides, I dream about the Lobster Mash Potatoes! I am also a huge fan of their brussel sprouts, crab gnocchi and gorgonzola mac and cheese.  As if amazing food wasn't enough reason to go here, the service is spot on too.   You will leave here full, happy and with a little less money in your pocketbook, but it is completely worth it. Mastro's City Hall or Ocean Club are go to places for a special occasions, date nights, anniversaries etc...

I've been to Kabuki a few times and have never been that impressed. The service is mediocre, the food is decent at best and the cocktails are nothing special. The ingredients seem semi fresh, but there are definitely way better places in the valley if you are looking for delicious sushi. My suggestions: Ra, Blue Wasabi or Squid Ink (depending on which part of the valley you are in).  If for some reason my review hasn't changed your mind from going and you find yourself at Kabuki DO NOT order the Sangria, you WILL BE disappointed. As for the food -- I guess there are worse places you could go.

A go to place for a filling, warm and delicious meal! When you think pasty you might just think of the traditional meat and potatoes, but this spot offers SO much more. Being a non meat eater I enjoy their long list of vegetarian pasty options. I have pretty much tried them all and there is not one that I do not like.   If I had to give my favorites they would be: Veggie Spicy Asiago, Veggie Rosemary & Veggie Pesto. All equally delicious!   The restaurant itself definitely has a hipster vibe- dark, wine bottles with candle wax dripping down the side, old church pews as table benches. They also have a large outdoor patio.   Don't have time for a sit down meal? Call in your order to go. They will either cook them hot and ready to eat or half bake them and you can pop them in your oven at home to eat when you are ready.   For take out, dine in or a late night bite and a beer this place is a must!

Three Words: Macaroni and Cheese!  You can also opt for a side of mac & cheese to save room for one of their fresh salads or a thin crust pizza.  Sauce is a casual place good for both lunch and dinner. During summer they offer a summer sampler which includes a pizza, salad and 2 glasses of wine for only $20!

Went here once and haven't gone back. Ordered the breakfast sandwich with no bacon because i'm a vegetarian. Sandwich came out with bacon. No big deal, i'm flexible and every restaurants makes mistakes. Ask them for a new sandwich. Waitress says "do you want a fresh one or do you want me to just take the bacon off?"  Asked to be remade since I don't eat meat and the bacon and already been smothered in between the eggs and cheese. Comes back rather quickly with a "new" sandwich so I say "this is a brand new sandwich, that was quick?" She said yes and I start to eat it only to find bits of bacon still stuck in the egg and cheese. I was not upset that the sandwich was incorrect in the first place, but the fact that the waitress just picked off the bacon and then lied to me was outrageous. If I was wanted it being picked off I would have used my own hands! Further, when I showed her the sandwich she did not even apologize. I will say that right before we were leaving a manager did come out and apologize and provided me a gift card to try their place again, though I don't think it will get used by me as I don't plan on returning.

I work downtown and this is one of my go to places for a quick, fresh and fast lunch. The salad bar is always stocked with fresh ingredients, which makes it super convenient for lunch on the go.   If you've got a sweet tooth I would suggest their 7 Layer Bar or a gelato fresh baked cookie sandwich. You cannot go wrong with either.   If you are looking for a quick and casual environment for a sandwich/salad/slice of pizza, I highly recommend Chloe's.

Amazing is the only way to describe this place! Atmosphere is low key, trendy, & fun and their bruschetta is the best around.   Go for happy hour, sit on the patio and enjoy a $5 glass or wine or pitcher of beer and a board of bruschetta. Or go on Monday & Tuesday after 8pm get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for only $20. You won't be disappointed!

I come here for the atmosphere and the pretzel fondue! Culinary is right in the middle of things in Scottsdale and it is a fun atmosphere for drinks/dinner before a night out on the town. It is trendy, upbeat and has live music on weekends, which can also make it pretty loud.   The food is pretty good too, but not a ton of options for those (like me) who don't eat meat. I have never come here and not started with the pretzel fondue (they're amazing) and my go to menu item is usually the Ahi Salad.

Such a cute place-great atmosphere--outdoor seating, separate bar to order drinks from indoors and out, dog friendly patio, healthy, delicious the list goes on. My favorite place for a salad and a fresh squeezed juice. Their Kale Cleanse is amazing & the BBQ chicken salad (no chicken, add avocado for me) is the best! Highly recommend you check this place out!
