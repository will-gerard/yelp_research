I went here on Saturday night 10 Jan 2009, at the culmination of 3 days of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and Adult Video News (AVN) awards, arguably the best convention week/end in Vegas each year.  XS has been covered very well by the others here so I will just say a few words.  Actually two.    Absolutely amazing.  I've partied in Dubai, Monaco, Paris, Moscow, London, on super-yachts, you name it - XS is hands down one of the three best of anywhere I have been, for many of the reasons stated by others and simply flawless execution by the club staff.  WOW.

Went to this place late night with a friend as it was the only place open in the area that was not reminiscent of a biker bar.  We had: - Skillet queso dip - Bacon flatbread (pizza) - Cheese flatbread (pizza)  It was greasy and gave us heartburn and indigestion.  They gave us Seagrams when we asked for grey goose and the tab was $88 w/o tip.  For a beer, a grey goose and 3 apps that were horrible.  I won't be back.

James Beard award winner. Another JB award winner across the street (Pizzeria Bianco).  I loved this place. A cool little Japanese tea house and small plates establishment with a lot of character. Chef Futaka is a very gracious host and greeted us on arrival and departure as well as chatting with us for a few minutes about various dishes.  Dessert was amazing (I'm leaving that a secret) and ambiance is intimate and quiet - service was exceptional. Highly recommended.
