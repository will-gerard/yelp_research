Oh, I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  R.I.L.F.  I loved you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells.   You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).  The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?    And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.    Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it.   So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.    You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.  R.I.L.F:  Restaraunt I'd Like t....nevermind.

Solid.  It all comes down to the word "solid".    The carne asada burrito, standard amongst *berto's purists (*insert your own prefix here...Fili, Rigo, Ernie &...whatev)?  Solid.  The rice and beans, often times overlooked drivel at such an establishment?  Solid.  The carne asada fries, a delicacy not even on the menu (a pile of fries topped with a mound of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and pico de gallo...I think I just jizzed in my pants)?  Surprisingly solid.  Not quite Riva's in Tempe-solid, but solid none the less.  The business end of the food, about a day later, normally watery and of the Tijuana-Two Step variety?  Not this time pal.  SOLID. (Ok, that was gross.  I apologize in advance for both making a poop joke and actually waiting this long to deliver the SOLID punchline)  Anyone complaining about bathrooms, garbage cans or service obviously has no idea what  they're doing in a dive burrito joint on Chandler Blvd.  You go, you order, you get your burrito and get the hell out.  If you have to eat there, your luck really sucks because this is the kind of food that is best when ordered to-go.    Do you think the lady behind the counter is there to smile at you?  Will it improve your food?  Would you rather her be all business, take your order, get it done fast and quick and hot out the door, or would you rather have her chit-chat with everyone in line at lunch time in a business area when you've only got 20 minutes left on lunch and Johnny Junkforbrains is up front asking her about her fine horchata-mixing skills?  Yeah.  Me either.  So basically, go get a solid burrito and shut up.

This is ONLY about their wings, and I've heard that everything else on their menu is fine, though I've had several people tell me that this place is racist, unsolicited.  And trust me, we wish we never came here.  Their wings were the absolute worst wings I've ever had, it was a nightmare of wing-eating and the absolute nadir for our site.  We've been to shitholes and dives and crackdens in search of wings, but the worst ones were right here at Flancers.    We wrote a review and apparently some people weren't too happy with it and kept telling us their sandwiches were great, but we didn't give a shit.  We didn't review a sandwich, we reviewed barely-edible wings.

I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.  For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.  The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M.   Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like "health code violations" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.  And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.

Ugh.    I wanted a teriyaki bowl.  I might have wanted a sandwich.  Hell, I might have wanted a cup of frogurt.   What I didn't want was to pay $9 for an all-white meat chicken bowl because if I had wanted the cheaper mixed-meat bowl, I would have had to wait 20 minutes because they were out.  Too bad for me, I was on lunch and hungry and already there.  WOMP WOMP WOMP.    So I expect something grand for $9 but get something that isn't even quite as good as Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sam's, two places that are cheaper and quicker by far.  The rice was blah, the chicken was meh, and the sauce wasn't really all that great either.  My co-worker went there the next day, got a sandwich, found 3 hairs in it, and when she went back, the manager told her they'd make her a new one but they wouldn't refund her money.    Yeah, it's not indicative of every single eating experience there, and the teriyaki bowl wasn't horrible, just horribly overpriced (which is why they get two stars instead of one), but unless they have some manner of overhaul, they can eat my balls.

Ted's rules.  Great char-grilled hot dogs, killer onion rings, and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dog-eatin' experience.

I find it funny that people are calling this "cheap" and "authentic".  The only way anyone could say that is if they're natives of California, where a $3 taco or $7 burrito is considered "cheap" and mixing average rice and beans into a burrito is considered "authentic".   It's not bad, by any means.  The food is hot and reminds me of that California beach-style mexican that you can get in San Diego.  I guess maybe I'm just not that sort of beaner, as I personally feel the Sonoran or New Mexican styles are just better tasting.    Regardless, someone mentioned being embarrassed that the multiple entrances confused them.  Don't feel bad, buddy.  I walked all around the building feeling like a jackass because i wasn't sure where to go.  And then I go in and realize you have to order at some awkwardly placed cash register, and it's cash only, and that's already a few marks off.  Then when the food was lackluster, I decided that Guedo's (aptly named, this is the kind of place that just screams "COME SEE ME, TOURISTS!") just isn't my bag, baby.  The only thing that really saved this place from certain craphole-status is their outside patio/bar.  It's a nice looking place and when the weather starts getting right in the Phoenix area (basically any time except the hottest parts of summer) it'd be a nice place to get toasted and try to hit on pasty out-of-towners wandering over from the San Marcos resort.

The deal with Buffalo Wild Wings is this: Stay the fuck away from it.  Just don't go.  If you go anywhere else, the service will range from slightly below average to good, but stay the hell away from that place.    Trust me.  The other locations are fine, however.  Now then, service aside, on to the food.  BWW (Or B-Dubs, or B-Dub-Dub, or Bufwizzle For Shizzle, or Bu-...you get the point) has a selection of big sized burgers that thankfully now come with fries.  Previously, paying $6-8 netted you simply a burger sans accoutrements, so I'm glad that they've seen the err of their ways and wisened up.   They have ribs that are adequate, nice and messy, tacos with whatever sauce you want, chicken sandwiches, and a whole mess of appetizers ranging from mini-cheeseburgers and corn dogs to thick slices of potato dubbed "Buffalo Chips" that go great with cheese on top.  The gold standard, however, are their sour cream and chive-infused potato wedges.  These things are killer, and I highly recommend you get a basket with your wings.  The wings themselves, whether boneless or traditional, are "OK" at best, though the variety of sauces they have are delectable.  Go with the Mango Habanero, Asian Zing or Caribbean Jerk wings for a sweet/hot combo.    All in all, a good sports bar type atmosphere and beer specials go well with their mediocre wings, and so long as a game is on, you won't notice whether the service sucks or not, which it probably will.  The food makes up for it though, damnit.  But don't you dare go to that shithole in Mesa.  I'll kick your ass.

I loathe the people that dare mark this place off for its parking situation.  People gripe all the time that the Phoenix area has no cool older buildings nor history, so when you get one, you gripe that it wasn't built with a parking lot?  Pssssh.  Man up.  That being said, I love Four Peaks.  It's a chunk of PHX that we can actually brag about to people from else.  What other brewery out there has this well-known of a beer (Kiltlifter, the de facto beer of the Phoenix area) and THIS good of food?  Steak sandwich is ballin', a delicious and perfectly cooked filet with onion straws and blue cheese (seriously...I dont know how you can live without this once you taste it).  Chicken strips are ballin', they're so perfectly battered and tender, and the chipotle ranch is perfect.  The nachos are a heaping mound of chips and heaven.  They actually took their time to make not just Bar Food, but GOOD Bar Food.  This beats most restaurants, bar be damned.  Man up and live a little.  WAH IT'S CROWDED.  WAH I CAN'T FIND PARKING.  Deal with it, life is hard.

If you want an authentic experience, if you really want to feel like you have some manner of ethnic experience, you need to come to Haji Baba.    It's a little middle-eastern market.  It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.    The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.    It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.    Good ol' Haji Baba.

These potstickers are lifechanging.  Seriously.  Swani is a sweet lady that seems to actually care about the food she serves people, and it shows.  Their spicy beef was actually spicy, the beef was cooked fantastically, the lo mein noodles on another dish were heavenly.  But those potstickers?  Those potstickers are lifechanging.  Hand-made, pan-cooked, THEY.  ARE.  PERFECT.

Someburro's kicks ass.  It's a nice middle ground between the standard *Berto's and the more sit-down experience.  Pollo Fundido and Borracho Burritos are awesome.  Service is quick. Beaners are bean-y.  There's nothing spectacular about this place, just really good, solid food served hot and quick.  Dig it.

At the behest of a few friends and some glowing Yelp reviews, I decided to venture to Chino.   The one on Dobson and Chandler is practically invisible unless you know where to look, but once I found it I thought it was kinda cool that it was hidden away like some manner of Indiana Jones treasure (there's a timely reference for you).  The people inside are BEYOND friendly.  Like, super friendly.  Like, if they weren't serving my food and helping me understand the complexities of their menu, they might have freaked me out, sorta like It the Clown or that one episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark or Michael Jackson's nose (or lack thereof).   They really do give you a crash course on how to order, and give you samples of everything.  I got the machaca beef and the emerald chicken, with jerk rice and refried beans.  Dear lord.  Talk about scrumtrilescent.  The machaca was so flavorful and delicious, and the emerald chicken was just the most amazing thing I've ever put in a tortilla (beside the one time me and this girl were messing around using food, and I...nevermind).  The only thing that could possibly make this place any better is a bigger selection of drinks.  Some Mexican drinks (Horchata, maybe) fresh made or some juices and teas might make it complete.  So good.  So so good.

This place smells stale.  The bar looks like it walked right out of 1987's Handbook For Setting Up A Sports Bar - poorly lit, a handful of TVs, a couple of decent beer taps, mediocre prices.  The wings are terrible here.  I remember when Native had good wings.  Now these are laughable, and with all the better wing places in the Phoenix area, Native is a bad choice.    The service is slow.  Granted, that's par for the course in Maricopa, but still.  I wouldn't waste my time.  Even the Luxe Lounge in the Multi-tainment Center has better wings.

Update - the remodel, the $2.50 Dos Equis and the decline of the Luxe Lounge have all influenced my perception of this place.    I'll never love their wings, but their chicken-strippers are good, the sauces work, the prices have improved, the service is great now, there are plenty of TVs, and really in a town with very few options they've set themselves apart.  Good job.

This place is fantastic, and I make it a point to come here every time I'm in Vegas.  Their blue cheese burger is juicy, salty, crunchy...it's perfect.  Their cheese fries are insane.  The patio is a nice place to people watch, and really it's just a non-pretentious and laid-back place, which can be tough to find on the strip.  I find this place to actually be much better than Gordon Ramsay's BRGR and maybe even a little better (or at least even with) Bobby's Burger Palace.  If there's a better burger on the strip, I haven't found it.

Alright, so here's the thing:  I like to drink.  It's something I do well, and I figure that anything you can do well should be done often.  With that being said, I do not take it lightly when a restaurant names itself after an alcoholic beverage (we'll get to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville later).  That being said, it was my brother of all people who introduced me to Sake Bombers.  He said to me "Las Vegas rolls, chicken wings and a sake bomber will do you just right."  He wasn't lying.  The problem that people may have with me reviewing a sushi bar is that I don't eat seafood.  I'm allergic to a lot of it.  So you may be thinking "Why in the shit am I reading this, you twit?"  Well, because I'm not allergic to alcohol or appetizers, two things that Sake Bombers does well.    The chicken wings they serve have an Asian influence and a spice to them, though I wouldn't call them spicy.  They're a dry rub, not sauced, and they're swear-to-god delicious.  Now, I don't eat sushi, but I'm told by all that accompanied us that the Las Vegas roll, with jalapeno in it, and the White Castle roll, with cream cheese and horseradish, are delicious alternatives to the more standard fare.  As far as the alcohol goes, during happy hour you can get warm sake for $1, a full bomber set for $5, and a Kirin or other Japanese beer for $4.  They have a variety of other cocktails and such, so every type of drinker will be pleased.  The mood is right, tv's and music playing, the crowd is mixed between college-types and after-work specials, and the service is good.  If you don't go to Sake Bombers, I'll fight you.

I had heard about SanTan Brewery from several faux-yuppie types and, to be honest, didn't really give a crap about it for the longest time.  I mean, really...screw those people.  Then I realized that it was practically around the corner from me and the beer was supposed to be Four Peaks-quality, and I changed my tune slightly.    We went on a Sunday, not too busy in there, and I decided to sample the beers, which were pretty much standard micro-brewery fare (good stuff).  My date got the Aegean burger and I ordered a spicy slow-roasted pork dish.  The service wasn't great, but the outdoor patio and space heaters surely were.  Being across the street from the San Marcos Hotel/Golf Course gave for a nice outdoor setting.    The Aegean burger was killer, stuffed with feta cheese and olives, it was a great Greek burger.  The fries were well-seasoned and fresh.  My slow-roasted pork was freakin' sweet.  It was spicy and tender, came in large cubes and doused in a red sauce.  The black beans were topped with cheese and the spanish rice was decent too.  If you live in the area, give it a whirl, it might become a favorite spot of yours.  If you live far away, I would say to not kill yourself trying to get there because you could just as well go to BJ's or Four Peaks and it'd be about the same, give or take, except that the creative (albeit short) food menu makes up for any shortcomings.  I'm going back to try the pizza that I hear is delicious, but it's gonna be hard to sway myself from that killer pork dish.

IRRESPONSIBLE.  TERRIBLE.  ABSOLUTE JOKE OF A BAR.  Screw this place.  I already was pretty lukewarm on this joint, it's very mediocre, the crowd is kind of douchey, and the beers are expensive.  But my friends wanted to go on a saturday, so I joined.  I ordered one beer.  One.  ONE.  "Do you want to keep your tab open?' the bartender asked.  Sure.  Why not.  10 minutes later my friends say "This place kind of sucks [they're right], let's go!"  Hey bartender, can I close my tab?  "Sure, let me just find your card."  It's been 10 minutes.  One beer.  8pm on a Saturday, not 1am and mayhem.  Cant find it. "We're getting it for you." they tell me.  They're trying to act like they DIDN'T just lose my debit card.    Finally 20 minutes later they ask me again for my name and what it looks like.  Can't find it.  Keep looking in the same five spots over and over like it's going to magically re-appear.  Can't find it.    I'm so pissed at this point...I have no other way to pay for anything on me, when I go out I just bring my license and my card.  I need gas to get home.  I wanted to have a good night.  Nope, they ruined it.  I leave, tell them I'll be back in an hour.  Go to San Tan, where they don't lose cards after 10 minutes.  Go back to Irish Republic later.  "I dont know what to tell you man, it's like it just disappeared!"  I'm livid.  I'm probably being a dick to the guy that tells me that.  I tell him I have no money to get home now, because of their irresponsibility.  "Yeah we'll keep looking."    When I tell him he can probably call off the search because it's incredibly obvious that they didn't LOSE my card, they GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, he shakes his head.  "No that certainly didn't happen.  It's here man.  Sorry!"  In the morning I find charges I didn't make, at In-N-Out Burger and Joe's Farm Grill.  Now I have to dispute those.  Had to have someone loan me money to get home.  Couldn't enjoy my night out with friends.    This bar is a poorly managed mess and sucks terrible dick.  Don't go there.  Don't give them your cards.  Hell, don't give them your money, they might claim to lose it and ask you for more.    This place is garbage.  I'll be putting it on every form of media I know that this place can go straight to hell.

Eating the buffet here is like asking for an All-You-Can-Cry Buffet of Sadness.  Just pathetic, there's like 6 cold, mealy entrees and some hard ass rice and some suspect sides.  It's not worth the money, especially since they upped the price.  The delivery is better because often they have to make it (kind of) fresh, but even that is expensive and at best just under mediocre.   They have the market cornered unless you feel like waiting in line at Panda (seriously, what is with Maricopa and all the fast food places having lines around the block around dinner time...does no one cook?), but if a Pei Wei or something opened up here, Great Wall could kiss its greasy spoon goodbye.

Is it the best Mexican food in the world?  No, it's not.  But it's good tasting, you get plenty for your money, and the price is right.  Their bowls of menudo are huge, their breakfast burritos are really excellent, and their entrees give plenty.  Full salsa bar that's always clean, serves alcohol, has Jarritos and Mexican Coke?  Probably the best Mexican in town at this point.

Not understanding the outstanding reviews for this place.  Despite being one of like 5 couples in this mostly-dead restaurant, our server took a while to show up, and then took another 15 minutes or so to bring out a basket of garlic knots.  Funny enough, they ended up being the best part of the meal - hot, fresh, flavorful, and only $3.   I ordered The Works pizza, my wife got the mediterranean salad.  Her salad was sad looking - a huge pile of iceberg lettuce, topped with canned red peppers, canned artichokes, canned kalamata olives (that were weirdly black, not the deep purple color kalamata olives normally are), a disgustingly pale-pink few slices of tomato and a sprinkling of pre-crumbled feta.  Funny thing is, if this salad had been $5 or $6, I probably would have said "Hey, at least it's big and the price is right."  But it was $9.  I expect it to be something decent for a $9 salad.  My pizza came out looking pretty generic, but I gave it a shot.  So, I say this not to try and be condescending or snobby but just to be dead serious:  The pizza tasted EXACTLY, I mean like ABSOLUTELY THE SAME as Peter Piper Pizza.  The toppings, the crust, the sauce, the cheese, I mean...this basically was Peter Piper Pizza.  And as a poor Mexican, I've had my fair share of PPP so I know it when I have it.  I didn't know whether to be impressed or sad.  I saw all the pastas coming out of the kitchen and they all looked good, and the portions were enormous (word to the owner - it's pasta.  Wanna lower your costs?  Then serve less and quit sending everyone home with leftovers) but if the pastas were of the same quality as the pizza and salad, then I'm glad I didn't order any.  More so because they were all like $15 a plate.  This isn't Scottsdale, it's freaking Maricopa.  Lower your prices, make smaller portions and make them higher quality.  And for crap's sake, figure out your identity.  Are you a sports bar?  Then add more TVs and play some music.  Are you a fine Italian restaurant?  Then lose the neon beer signs and add some class to the place.  Are you a deli?  No?  Then get rid of the dessert case.  So weird.

I like that, even with their slightly limited taps, they still manage to have a better craft beer selection than almost any other place in Maricopa.  Havent really had the food much, and sure it can feel like you're not really one of the regulars, but what a cool location and a nice way to feel like you're really out of the city.

This place is ballin'.  I don't know if the other people that ate here just had a bad experience or what, but I frankly don't give a shit.  We went in here by simply stumbling into it, and were immediately impressed.  The decor and ambience is pretty charming, lots of brick and german beer signs.  Good selection of non-standard beers too, which is definitely a plus, but whoever said the food was just ok was either high, stupid, or had the exception to the rule.  We had the poutine (a Canadian delicacy...french fries smothered in gravy, cheese sauce and cheese curds) and couldn't put it down, we literally had to force ourselves to stop to save room for our food.  My wife ordered a wedge salad, and it was massive and totally fresh with big chunks of bacon.  She got a side of mac-n-cheese and it came in a bubbling little cauldron with a ton of bacon topping it, and it was gooey and heavenly.  I got the meatloaf melt sandwich, smothered with sauteed onions, stone ground mustard, and served on toasted sourdough bread, and it was EXCELLENT.  Either we have haters, snobs, old people, or a few one-off experiences littering the reviews for the joint because it's pretty snazzy.  Seriously.

The Tikka Masala fries ended up being a little disappointing, the flavor of the sauce was a little lacking.  But whatever, what do you expect ordering white people food?  I did get the chicken tikka masala (yes, I know, more white people food), and the sauce was better here (shouldn't it be the same sauce?) But the star was the chicken.  It was so tender, falling apart and just awesome.  My wife got the hummus with beef and it was a surprise.  There was so much for the price and it was packed with flavor.  It's tough to warrant going here when Haji Baba is so close, but Curry Corner is JUST different enough that I can say it's worth it sometimes.

It's time for a remodel.  We know it, Harrah's knows it, and it seems like they're just trying to tread water here while they figure out what they're going to do, because we all know this isn't sustainable for much longer without it becoming just an actual hovel of white-haired smoke tornados surrounding D-list musical acts.  Maybe it doesn't have to get all world-class on us, maybe it isn't smart to spend the money to try and turn it into Wild Horse Pass or Talking Stick or even the new and improved Vee Quiva, but expanding to give more space, finding a hook that can draw in a better quality of crowd, LOWERING THE DAMN DRINK PRICES and filtering the smoke better might help.    People dont come to Maricopa for nightlife so I cant blame them for not concentrating on giving this casino any manner of nightlife, but damn, it's a boring, old-school place at this point.

Hoooooly shit, how is it even possible to be this bad?  I've tried several times to get a decent experience out of this dump, so many so that at this point I feel like I have battered woman syndrome - they keep punching me in the face and I keep going back (sorry to any battered women who also use Yelp, which is probably a really weird looking Venn Diagram).  I've been told at least twice that they were out of chicken, a few more times told that I'd have to wait 15 minutes if I wanted chicken, a few more times than that just given cold and soggy chicken, and even more times than that just had to wait forever without being told the wait was going to be long only to get the wrong food anyway.    The restaurant is always in that state of like...you know how people that have a lot of young kids do a brief clean-up just after dinner, and the kitchen isn't what you would call clean but at least they picked up enough that it isn't gross and will make clean-up later on a lot easier?  Yeah, it's usually a step below that.  I mean, there isn't actual human poop on the floor or anything, but there's crumbs and corn kernels, sticky soda stains and used napkins.   Their employees all look like someone is crouching just below the counter with a knife to their kneecaps, ready to cut them real good if they don't take your order.  They all look like they hate their life but they're being forced to work there.  Just shut this place down and put a chicken coop and plant some corn and potatoes here, you'll get your food faster, cleaner and better.

Welcome to Burrito Heaven.  There's room for everyone here.  If you have not been to Chipotle, you must.  It is like looking at the face of God and having him stare back, saying "You are my most wondrous creation."  People always say "What's the big deal about a burrito joint anyway?"  Nothing.  But this is a burrito joint like the Super Bowl is a football game.  You start with a giant tortilla.  You start with three small flour tortillas.  You start with a bowl.  You just start.    What you do from there is your choice, and each choice is rewarding, fulfilling and fresh.  The cilantro-lime rice is steaming when you get it and its citrus-y smell is what I imagine angels might smell like (or the inside of a bottle of Corona or something.  Use your imagination, damn it).  The meats are incredible too.  Chicken is grilled and chopped right where you can see it.  Barbacoa, a slow-simmered and spiced shredded beef, is elegant in its flavors and its tenderness.  The Carnitas, a roasted, shredded pork, is juicy and succulent.  And don't get me started on the Steak...cooked medium and spiced with adobo, it's slightly spicy and super-deelish.  The salsa, from the standard but fresh pico de gallo to the roasted corn salsa to the hot (with seeds) and green mediums, are all a perfect compliment to any and all of the meats, and you can experiment around as you see fit.  Sour cream?  Cheese?  Sure.  But don't cheap out on the extra money you have to pay to get the guacamole.  Thick, chunky, creamy green Jesus in vegetable form is what you'll find, and I swear to God if I find out any of you skip the guacamole, I'll hunt you down and Buffalo-Bill your asses.  The guacamole is so good, it makes Ghandi look like a child-pornographer.  Then they wrap it up in foil.  They hand it to you.  You pay.  You sit down at your seat.  You reach to pick it up and, after feeling the weight of it, think to yourself that maybe you need to hit the gym or something.  You've grown weak.  Only you haven't grown weak.  You're just holding what amounts to about a 2-3 pound piece of Burrito-Christ.  Rip off the foil.  Bite into it.  Taste it.  Savor it.  Paint out your feelings of how great it is on a canvas, lock it away for a year, open it up a year later and view it again.  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  Ok, so I'm being over-dramatic.  Sue me, I love Chipotle and everyone I've ever known who has come with me to experience has walked away enlightened and full to the brim.    I should be like a Chipotle shaman or something, I swear :D

This place is a dive, and it's dank, and it's dark, and I don't care.  It's called The Reef and I'm glad they changed the name because "Draft House" would imply that they had a great selection of draft beers (they don't).  All of that, and still 4 stars?  Well you see, their wings are stellar.  This isn't a recommendation from some schlub who thinks all wings are just the best...you all know that guy....he eats a dozen wings that look cold and slimy and says "They're not bad!".  No, I'm a wing connoisseur, having traveled far and wide to find the best wings in the city, and I can safely say these are Top 3 Wings.  Better than Native's mediocre dreck.  Better than Buffalo Wild Wing's garbage.  Better than most of your sports bars that have won awards (looking at you, Half Moon).  Better than ATL Wings across the street? ....ehhhh probably not.  But still, stellar, big, well-cooked wings with a GREAT hot sauce.  And try the Donkey Sauce, it'll kick the shit out of you.

I love this place.  I go to a lot of places.  Some try to be too ambitious and fall on the face with their overly-complicated menus. Some try to take things down to a more simple idea and end up overshooting, making everything bland and too usual.  Angel Trumpet has no such flaws.  They're also not perfect, but I can justify that 5-star review.    Let's get it out of the way:  The chairs suck, they're kind of uncomfortable and rigid.  The beer prices are kind of what we like to call "astronomical" for a mostly poor beanly-fellow such as myself.  The food can come out a little slow.  It's all true, if someone else said it in another review, I can back that all up.  And yet, I don't really give a damn.  This is a local joint in downtown Phoenix peddling 31 different beers that are always rotating.  Not a "regular" beer in sight.  It's what downtown Phoenix has been clamoring for.  And if you're coming to an ale house, you're coming to drink first and eat later.  Still, I like their food.  Stroganoff burger...oh man.  I'm such a sour cream whore and, I love my food saucy and wet but I hate soggy stuff.  The bun stood up to the stroganoff sauce and the sour cream and the mushrooms and the juicy medium-cooked beef perfectly.  The 810 sandwich with hand-pulled turkey works in spite of the overly-southwestern theme (pull back on the adobo a bit, it can taste like the restaurant equivalent of "taco seasoning" that every white person I know uses to make tacos) because each of the ingredients is high-quality.  The bread is fresh and crisped.  The ribbon chips are amazingly thin.  People have griped and complained for literally decades that downtown doesn't have any neat, laid-back places to have a beer and be a human, with most places downtown still ready to serve the post-5pm cattle herd and nothing more.  Here you have a genuine Phoenix experience.  Don't gripe too much.  Soak it up.    We'll will be back there.  Will you?

Oh man - they just updated their menu.  This is hilarious.  I get that this is a newer place with a nice setup, clean, big TVs, etc etc, so the idea to raise prices and go all upscale must have been tempting.  To idiots.  It must have been tempting to idiots.  The idiots that must manage this place.  But seeing how completely and totally empty it was on a Sunday Football Afternoon with some serious marquee matchups, I think other people are realizing this as well.   Believe me, as fairly nice as the Multitainment Center is for Maricopa and as nice as the Luxe Lounge is (for MARICOPA), no one was going there for an upscale experience.  They were going there because the 2 other sports bar options (Native New Yorker and O'Sheas) are shitholes.  But that doesn't mean you should take this as an invitation to completely revamp your food menu to try and entice upscale diners, because the potential clientele you're trying to entice in this city mostly don't exist!    Oh, am I being harsh about this?  Yeah maybe...maybe I was just miffed that they discontinued the all-day Sunday happy hour and instead just left it at a list of like 6 food items you could order for "cheap", including a TEN DOLLAR POPCORN SHRIMP BASKET.  On special.  $10 on special for a popcorn shrimp basket from this place.  But onto the new menu, including a $14 prime rib slider APPETIZER.  HAHAHAHAHA.  Really?  Have you seen the hood ass people that go in there after 9pm on a Saturday?  You're not selling this shit to them.  And have you seen the old people in their windbreakers trying to drink a cheap beer in there?  They're not going for this shit either.  And the fact that you led your sandwiches section with a PORTABELLA MUSHROOM SANDWICH?  HERE?  IN MARICOPA?  Are you a fucking ass?  This is Maricopa, and while there are clearly exceptions to every rule, the majority of the people here are family folk, they're not vegetarian hipsters and aren't exactly the same people that live in Tempe and go eat at Green or search for organics and vegetarian options.  But you're trying to entice exactly those people by leading with that sandwich!  And you have all of ONE craft beer on your...like...6 taps.  One.  You think you can entice the vegetarian upscale hipster crowd into your sports bar above a bowling alley and an arcade with buzzing ringing machines to come spend $12 on a portobella mushroom sandwich with Blue Moon, Dos Equis, Coors Light and Bud Light on tap?  You dumbasses watched too much Bar Rescue, thought it was time to add high-dollar items (hope to god it's not the same cooks - the food was wildly mediocre before, why would it suddenly get better?) and figured you'd just watch the upscale crowd (that does not exist in this city) flock to you?    Hold on, I'll be right back, I have to go pay you $16 for a mega meat calzone!  Or a margherita pizza (Stone fired it says...do you have a brick oven, or is this your way of saying you put a pizza stone in the oven?) for $14, which is what it costs for a margherita pizza at Pizzeria Bianco!  Oh man, I could go on for days over this.  You silly people.  You make bad decisions and it's funny.

Update to the update:  Now they've removed wings from their happy hour (literally one of their only saving graces) and replaced it with things like "CHEESY BREAD $4"!  Hooooly shit who's running this place?  Their beer tastes either flat or watered down at all times (not even joking - get a pro to look at your setup because it's sucked since you opened) and they have all of like...6 beers on tap.  No local beer anymore (can't consider Kilt Lifter local any more than you can consider Budweiser local to St Louis) so it's just the 6 dumpiest and shittiest taps of crap beer you can get.    No cheap wings.  Flat beer.  Empty during happy hour on a Friday night.  Yeah...looks like you guys have been making all the right decisions for this place, hahahahaha!

I can't drink black coffee...or so I thought, until I walked into Crate.  This guy knows his coffee, he's like a mad scientist with beans.  Best cup of coffee I've ever had, his pour-over method is so simple and yet so amazing.  Maricopa doesn't even feel like it deserves a place this cool.

Something about waiting an hour and fifteen minutes for your food really turns you off from it.  It was pretty ok food too, as far as breakfast goes, but it was insane...how long does it take to cook an omelette?    And there was this creepy guy alone at the table next to us telling us "You're gonna love this food, best you ever had!" and then we heard him tell the waitress he had never eaten there.  Wouldn't leave us alone (that's not the restaurant's fault).  Got a few tri-tip sandwiches to go, thinking it'd be great...$45 later.  No thanks.   Not sure if everyone in Maricopa is just starved for decent food (more than likely) but I can't stand the lack of good service in this town, it's atrocious all around.

The owner of this place is a hell of a salesman.  He believes in his product and obviously cares about the place and its origin, and I respect the hell out of that.  Recommended a flavor of pop (not soda, I learned) and was spot on.  The dogs were fantastic, the burger was small and simple and great, and that chili is killer.  This place is awesome.

I think a lot of people give this place a lower review because it's not beating you over the head with gimmicks like Gordon Ramsay is across the street, plus people seem to hate Bobby Flay for whatever reason.  Me personally, I like good food and don't give a shit who's cooking it.  The place is clean, the menu is short, and the product is simple in a fantastic way.  It's like people don't understand that this is supposed to feel like a blue plate special/simple lunch counter/diner style.   The burgers come with a variety of toppings, all of them fantastic (that blue cheese, holy shit) but are presented simply because they want the beef to shine through.  You can tell the quality of the beef in every perfectly-medium bite.  The bun is nothing special, but that's ok because it's essentially treated as a vessel to deliver that amazing beef to your mouth.  It's not gimmicky and it's not flashy but damn is it good.  Take the lines at BRGR, I'll stay here.

All I keep seeing are people talking about California in these reviews.    "OH PHOENIX HAS NOTHING AND L.A. HAS EVERYTHING!".   " OH MY, CALI IS THE GREATEST AND I MET GOD THERE AND HE GAVE ME A FOOT RUB WHILE I ATE A BOWL OF RAMEN!"  "OH YEAH I MEAN I LOVE HOW I CAN LIVE AND EXIST HERE FOR A REASONABLE PRICE ON A REGULAR WAGE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SHARE A STUDIO APARTMENT WITH 4 OTHER PEOPLE BUT THE SEAFOOD IS LACKING, ONE STAR!"  I dunno. Maybe you're all snooty bitches.  Maybe I'm a sour puss.  Maybe I'm writing this from the toilet and have nothing better to do than gripe about my most hated of all places.  But that's neither here nor there - what this is about is Dozo, and it's awesome.  Chicken thigh and sirloin beef skewers were amazing.  So tender and grilled just right.  Gotta try the beef tongue next.  Yakisoba was cooked to perfection, the veggies still had their crisp and the flavor was very good.  The ramen is fantastic, plentiful and presented exactly the right way.  Happy hour on Saturday as well, people! Service was great too, we were treated well.  I mean, it's no California...

Let's just say it upfront, because everyone who has been to Firehouse Subs is thinking it:  This place is expensive.  It'll cost you $9 or $10 for a sandwich, chips and a drink.  And then you'll get the medium sandwich and think "This is it?"  It might be a 9-inch sandwich.    But then you take a bite, taste this amazing amalgamation of fresh-sliced meat, good cheese, bread that stands up to the juices, a little mayo, a little veggie, whatever you picked, and you're like "....well damn.  That's pretty freaking good."  The Meatball sub is great - you see the pictures of it on their commercials or whatever and then you get it, and it's picture perfect.  The brisket sandwich is fantastic too.  So yeah, this isn't as cheap as Subway, but it also isn't oversaturated pre-cut garbage like Subway either, so quit complaining.  If it was as cheap as Subway, it'd have to taste like Subway, and if you want something as cheap as Subway (watch this), just go to Subway.  Simple as that.

I was ok with this place even despite its high prices and somewhat small sandwiches.  But then I went a few more times and the sandwiches were either wrong, or just poorly made, and to top it off when I asked for a couple of lids for the sauces, they had to have a side-conversation before letting me know I was allowed to have up to 3 lids and no more because they're apparently losing the farm on all those evil sauce thieves that just take too much sauce to go!   Apparently it's not an issue if people just use all the sauce they want while dining-in since there's no limit to sauce cups, just a limit to the fucking lids.  How intensely petty is that?  It's like fast food places that charge you for additional ketchup packets.  I didn't even WANT more than 3 sauce cups, I didn't even want all 3 (I had just poured their house sauce and a hot sauce), but how bad does your business have to be doing that you're now telling your customers they need to watch their condiment intake?    Just go out of business and sell real estate to Canadians or something instead if you're going to be petty.  I want a sandwich and a side of condiments, not a side of freaking guilt.

Ohh Stingray.  How I mourn for what you used to be.  This place was a solid happy hour spot.  The food is mediocre, the music is generic faux-laptop-DJ shit and the drinks are overpriced.  But on happy hour, hot damn.  It was all fantastic because the prices justified it.  But here we are today, and the sake bombers have gone from lower end of the spectrum $5 on happy hour to all of a sudden $8 each without warning.  Really?  Did you think your food and vibe was justifying raising the price that much?  Now you're the most expensive sake bombers around!    I'm disappointed.  This place isn't good enough to justify that kind of price for a bottle of Kirin and some trash sake.  It isn't enough to justify 8 for two shitty small skewers of chicken when Dozo does it better for cheaper.  Guess this is the last time I or my friends come to this heap, too bad because there's a lot of us and we're always looking for a decent happy hour.

I'm giving this 5 stars but it doesn't deserve 5 stars.  That's stupid, you might tell me, and you might be right.  I don't care.  I love Chipotle.  I love it so much. I'd drink their sour cream.  I could eat their guac all day every day and nothing else.  I love their rice.  I love it all.  What I hate is that, much like every other business in Maricopa, the service here sucks.  They're inconsistent, they dont know how to wrap a burrito right, they seem to miss easy/simple things and take forever to do stuff, sometimes the line looks downright sloppy.  The layout of this place is the worst for any Chipotle I've ever been in, and trust me I've been in a ton.  The parking lot of the entire strip mall is so bad.  Does Maricopa just get second-rate engineers and architects at all times?  Why is every parking lot in this city so awful?  Why is it so hard to get in and out of this freaking place?  Are they stupid?  I think they might be stupid.  Then again, I think I might be stupid because despite all that, I gave it five stars.  I did that because I love Chipotle, and I hate the lack of options in this town, and I could live at this, the shittiest of all Chipotles, forever simply because there isn't anything else better here.

I like Freddy's.  The burgers are thin and greasy and the wait can be slightly long, but it tastes fantastic, their fries are good, they have fry sauce (a plus) and the employees are friendly.  Now I wish we could get a Culvers or a Habit or something to compete.  And a light to turn left into that little shithole of a plaza.  Get it together Maricopa!

I'm...actually kind of shocked.  O'Shay's was a shithole of a divebar.  I get why some people liked it given our dearth of options in this town, but it was pretty lame.  What's funny is, not that much has changed in True Grit, yet it FEELS better in there.  Sure, they just added some shitty faux-old west wood above the same ol' bar, swapped out some tables for couches (that was dumb) and added a couple of signs, so it's not like they did a whole lot.  But it FEELS better!    They also have probably the best craft beer selection in town (which is kind of sad considering it's not a fantastic selection), and their food has gotten a lot better.  Their chicken strips are hand-breaded and delicious and their burgers look great.  It's a place where no one can really feel out of place, even when those scummy looking dudes in the back play pool and try to look cool, or the weirdos on the couch poorly sing karaoke, or the old guys at the end of the bar leer suggestively at anyone with even half a boob.  Despite all that, it's still a better option than the I-Wish-I-Was-A-Classy-Bar Luxe, which sucks.  It's not a fantastic place, but in Maricopa it's one of your best drinking options.

The food was pretty good, not amazing but good.  I don't know who said that their hot is real hot because it was kind of wimpy, but fine.  The problem is that we took a large group, and the server was just overwhelmed.  We tried our hardest to make it easy for her but the orders were jumbled, some people got the wrong meats, some got the wrong spices, some got the wrong starters, some got the wrong drinks, a few got the wrong checks...it was a mess.  The price was right and I'm willing to give the food another shot to wow me, but so far...ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

So there we were - literally the only customer's in this cavernous restaurant that formerly housed the Chino Bandido in Chandler, at like 4:45 on a Tuesday.    "This can't be promising" I thought.  Then the server came and cheerfully gave us menus that basically only have options for a $9-10 half chicken or a $16-18 whole chicken (depending on the style) plus sides.  Ok, not super expensive but not super cheap either, and not really a great option available for just one person.  Luckily we were two people.  Whole Padak Chicken with the hot, mild and padak sauces all on the side, plus egg fried rice is what we ordered.  Result?  THIS CHICKEN WAS AMAZING.  Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, the sauces were all fantastic.  The hot mixed with the mild created this really unique flavor that I couldn't get enough of, and the sort of soy/garlic/green onion/horseradish or mustard flavor of the padak sauce was incredible.   The egg fried rice threw me off at first, I expected it to be Panda Express style dry fried rice but this was eggy and buttery and after a while I couldn't get enough.  I'm going back, I'm bringing my coworkers, I'm going to skydive into this building, I'll fly on the wings of a falcon if I have to, but I'm getting my fix of dope Korean chicken again.

This new place is nice enough, but it became readily apparent that the people from The Perch had a hand in this place because it suffers the same problems - nice place, disorganized staff, WAY overpriced drinks and mediocre food with some poor menu choices.  Just way too expensive and not worth it, at least not yet.  Here's hoping it turns out better than the Perch.
