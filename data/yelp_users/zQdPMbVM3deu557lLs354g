Excellent service and food. We go every Sunday before I go to work and sometimes we are running late so we call ahead and order. We already know what we want because we get the same thing every week.  I also really like that they have stevia in the raw to sweeten my coffee. Every one working there are friendly and prompt.

I went in for a french pedicure & the lady doing it might as well have painted my whole nails white. Its a crappy french pedicure. Its too big & the lines were very uneven. Plus the whole time I was there, all the employees were talking in some asian language & laughing while looking at back n forth to their customers & each other which seemed very rude like a bunch of crap talking. Very unprofessional! On the plus side...they have an assortment of gell polish colors & did a good job w my manicure which is why I gave them 2 stars.

I felt $20 was way too much for a hand wash to begin with. The guy said he would also armor all the tires and vacuum the car which they did not. Also when I left and got home there was still gunk stuck to the car. They did a horrible job and I will never go back.

Wow.... first time here and I'm definitely coming back. I love how I put a lot of toppings on my burger and it did not fall apart. My bacon hamburger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The bun was so soft and not over sized. I love the fresh fries which came with a combo of long n soft and short n crispy. ...I like that. It was all so delicious I can't wait to come back.

This place is so full of flavor and friendliness. It's clean and colorful. They keep it real by keeping it family owned and operated.

My new favorite pizza place! It makes me so happy that they use a 140 year old sourdough starter for their pizza dough. This is exceptionally hard to come across especially for a pizza. The crust comes out perfectly. I had the Scarborough fair which is their signature pizza and for a reason because the toppings are on point. They are keeping it real here.
