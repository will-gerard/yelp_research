This place has some the absolute best chicken tikka masal in the valley... The courteous staff makes it even that much better. This dish can range from mild to blow your taste buds hot but they always seem to get it just right unlike other places. I would recommend this place to any and everyone!!!!

Wow I am truly impressed by not only Dr. Itos  knowledge, but also that of the dental assistants as well; I've never heard anything good about a root canal but I guess I'll be the first to say it wasn't bad. The superb service and hospitality completely supersedes the procedure itself.

Absolutely unacceptable in my eyes. Maybe if I didn't use the coupons is get better service?....no..... Didn't think so... They did get the water stains out of a dress shirt but the collars looked as though they were untouched .... You can get out a deep stain but not a collar stain???? The only reason I'll be going back is to get a refund

The food is actually pretty good and their really good at giving free credits when necessary it's not about how many negative experience but how they fixed them. Me and my son went and apparently the systems shut down and nothing worked but the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating I came back a week later and they everything right.

Never even made it to order and try the food before my four year old noticed bugs of some sort on the window sill to the kitchen I'm completely disgusted and will never even try this place ... There's never a good reason for bugs it's just unacceptable

OMG this guy is absolutely amazing I called him to make sure that he could fix my phone and I drove down and he was done within 10 minutes. My phone screen is crystal clear everything works just the same I would recommend this guy and this company to anyone hands-down.

Pretty good atmosphere I love how the workers are always polite constantly checking on everyone even though it can get a bit busy. I can count on my wings to be the same way each and every time no matter who's working. Hands down better than Buffalo Wild Wings!!!!! And did I mention it's always clean!!!!!!!!
