I honestly can't say enough good things about this place! First - the bar is awesome and always packed so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table/seat at the bar. The hh is amazing and goes til 7 which makes it even better. Most of the time I just stay and eat in the bar because the hh food is just as good as the other stuff!   We actually did go eat in the dining room though to have a bit more formal dinner. We split the filet, mushrooms, and shrimp appetizer. Everything was fabulous and the service was even better. Really can't say enough good things about this location!

The food was great! Cute little place in the mall. It has a great patio, but it's pretty small inside. It's a good place for a mimosa and eggs. Prices were decent, nothing too out of the ordinary. Definitely would come back.

All night happy hour?! Yep! Can't beat it! In addition to their normal happy hour during the week, they also extend it to all day Sunday and Monday. The only downside is its only in the bar and front patio, but hey for that deal you can make it work.  I got the green chili pork stew on the recommendation of the waiter. It comes with a side of warm tortillas and is the perfect size for a filling meal without feeling stuffed. The pork was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cheese topping and the extra zing from the chilis made this absolutely delectable. Definitely a must try!   If you want a go to place that always has great food, great service, and good atmosphere this is your place. Will definitely be back....again.

I went to the location on 68th St and Thomas and had a great experience. I went in to get an oil change and they recommended a few other things, which I went ahead and did. They were quick, friendly, and did a great job. I can't say enough good things about this store and location. It is definitely my new go to for anything auto, great job!

This is a great spot! I've been there several times and always have great food. It's definitely more low key, but it's still a great place to have a wonderful dinner. It also helps that it's byob, great way to Save on the alcohol markups most places have.  I recommend ordering a variety of plates and sharing everything. The menu is constantly changing so you never know what you're going to get. Last night we had the bone marrow, red beans and rice, barramundi, and pad Thai. Everything was exceptional, don't think you can go wrong with anything you get.

We had an excellent time! Went for restaurant week and my birthday, they were superb! The menu had a special birthday greeting along with a surprise dessert @ the end of the night. The food was awesome, I had the mahi mahi and it was perfect. The service can't be beat, I would go there any day of the week!

I hate when you buy a groupon and then to actually get what you want they up charge you for everything once you get there. Total turn off and Such was the case at canyon falls. I had a groupon for a massage and it completely fell short. The building itself is nice and the massage area was bigger than I expected. But a soon as the massage therapist came to get  me and said oh you have the groupon massage, I knew it was going to be bad and it was. It wasn't even the full 60 min it was supposed to be and she barely used any pressure. I basically left an oily mess still wanting an actual massage. Very disappointing and I definitely will not be returning.

What can be wrong with a place that has hh all night every night?! I think it's just a summer special, but hey, I'll take it! On top of great food and drink specials I've always had excellent service there, which to me, is the perfect combo!   The drink specials are ok. It's a few dollars off the normal priced drinks, so pretty normal for a happy hour. The food however, is awesome! For $3 the mini chibi burger is by far the best thing one the hh menu. The meet is rich, juicy, and flavorful. This is anything but your normal slider. Who would've thought you could get something so delicious at a restaurant that specializes in sushi! AMAZING. Try ordering one and I guarantee you'll get another :) Delicious!

If you feel like waiting, receiving poor service, and over paying for food you should try this place! The portions were small, too small. In fact, we actually left there to go eat somewhere else!   We had a reservation and still waited 20 minutes to be seated and it was only downhill from there. It took 5 min. before our waiter even came over and greeted us, and it was at least 10 min. before he came back to ask for our drink order. The drinks were ok, but overpriced.   When he finally made it back to take our dinner order we were starving. I ordered the pasta and my boyfriend got the steak. Definitely not what either of us expected, especially for the price we were paying. His entree was small and would have left anyone wanting more. While my pasta was slightly more filling, I too was not satisfied. We finished dinner feeling broke and hungry.   All those combined = not worth trying. Save your money, time, and appetite. Head next door to delux instead, you'll be much happier you did!

I've heard a lot about this place and have been wanting to try it for some time. So when I saw it as an option for restaurant week it seemed like the perfect opportunity. I made reservations weeks in advance and was excited to try it and see.  We arrived a little before our 8 o'clock reservation and were told it would be a few minutes. A few minutes quickly turned into 60 minutes. While the hostess was friendly and let us know we could get drinks at the bar, it was still annoying having to wait THAT long. I understand a few minutes behind, but what's the point of taking and making reservations if you're not going to stick to them.   Once we were finally seated our waiter was attentive but nothing special. It is an interesting experience though to not know what you're going to get! And it was fun to try everyone's dishes and compare. The food was phenomenal and the portion sizes were small, but perfectly filling. I left feeling full but not stuffed, which is ideal.   I can see how this would be hit or miss. Since we all shared everything, there were definitely better dishes than others. I was happy with the meal, but disappointed with the poor start. I think I would do it again, but you defintiely have to be with the right crowd who's going to want to share and try everything. This would be a fun spot to celebrate with a date or another couple, not something to do for a first date or work dinner.

This place does have great yogurt, especially The oatmeal cookie which is by far the best. Their service model though is extremely frustrating since they give out samples instead of having sample cups available. i waited for over 5 minutes to get one sample from the guy working who seemed less than interested in helping and barely said hi. No surprise when he rang me up and told me the price and that was it. A thank you or have a good day would have been way too much effort on his part.  Definitely wont go back to this location, very disappointed

We went to this place on a Wednesday evening and I was surprised by how many people were there! The bar was full and most tables in the main dining room were taken. We missed happy hour, but I was still pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. We got a good bottle of wine for $30 which was perfect for the two of us.   Our waitress immediately greeted us and asked for our drink order. We got a bruschetta appetizer, the steak was definitely the best. I ordered the tomato and mozarella panini which was delicious. It was just the right amount of food for me. My boyfriend ordered the bison burger which was more delicious and perfectly cooked medium. We both chose salads which I must say was a mistake because it left us both wanting more. Consequently we ordered a side of fries which were amazing! Definitely stick with the fries. They were heavenly and gone quickly.   I will definitely revisit 5TH and Wine. It has a great atmosphere, good food, good drinks, and reasonable prices. I must say I'm a fan and look forward to the next visit!

This is by far my favorite stingray. It has a great atmosphere, good drinks, and good food. We went there on a Friday night and it was pretty slow. We sat at the bar and had excellent service. Our bartender was superior and did a great job not only making us drinks but also making conversation.   The sushi was pretty good. The flavors were different and worked well together. The salmon sashimi was fresh and delicious.  I have to say I would go back here any day of the week. The experience is really what sold me and I felt like we were the only ones there. Great service really made this a superior experience. This is my favorite of any of the Stingray locations, love it!

Like everyone else we went for the drunk bread! It was definitely worth it...nothing beats cheese, bread, and wine, let alone all combined in to one. Delicious.  We also had the mushroom pizza which I'll admit sounded better than it was. It was still good and even better when dipped in their rosemary ranch dressing, but I can't say it was anything special.   For a Thursday night the place was packed, which is always a good sign and I get why. It's a warm and inviting atmosphere with good food. I would definitely go back, especially to try the bottomless mimosas on the weekends!

Went there with the parents and had a great time. It was crowded, but didn't feel too busy to where it was distracting, it had a good vibe.   Our service was outstanding and is definitely why I would go back. We had a great waiter who made the experience enjoyable. After reading reviews, I knew we had to try the pulled pork sandwich which was just as delicious as everyone said. The big surprise of the night was the shrimp appetizer which was awesome. It was creamy, flavorful, and a great way to start a meal. Definitely would get it again.   I was disappointed with the dessert menu. Nothing seemed to grab my attention and I was full enough from everything else.   All in all we had a great time, great food, and great service and all agreed we would definitely return.

I met a few friends there for a casual dinner and it was perfect. I've driven by this place 100 times and was excited to finally check it out! It's cute and simple inside, nothing over the top or super fancy. We started with the pork corn cakes which were delicious. The sauce had a little kick to it, which was was a nice surprise. We also split the bbq pizza and the baked potato. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about, but the potato was delicious! Smothered with more bbq pulled pork and cheese, it was delicious.   If you're looking for a cute place to grab a casual dinner this is a great place! All the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and is affordable. I will definitely be back!

I went there on a wed night and it was packed! It's apparently pajama night and if you were your pjs you get a discount, kinda a fun idea. Anyway it was decent. They didn't have the best flavors at the time but it was still a decent selection. They did hve a ton of toppings which I liked. All in all it was ok, I'd probably go back if I was in the neighborhood but wouldn't drive out of my way to go

I, of course, went here with a groupon and high hopes! I had been before but only for happy hour so I didn't try the pizza. We went there because they offer gluten free pizza and were hoping to find a great new place. Unfortunately, this was anything but. The crust was flat out not good. It was soggy and tasted awful. I barely choked down two pieces and that was only because I was hungry enough for it to seem worth it. I know finding good gluten free food can be difficult, but go ahead and cut this one off the list. Picazzo's is much better and for about the same price you can actually eat their food!

I gave this one star only because I had to, otherwise they would have gotten none. I used a groupon to try it for the first time to see if I liked it. The location itself is in a strip mall and the entrance is uninviting and seems disheveled. The massage was good, but I couldn't get over the squeaky table that constantly moved. I thought it would break at any point in the massage. Then to top it off, I rated them on groupon saying these things so they would improve and they responded with a snarky, rude message. Definitely not the way to run a business! Don't go there, not worth the money or the poor treatment!

I visited Pearl Med Spa because I received a coupon for a free facial. This is located right next to The Herb Box in old town and is beautiful when you walk in. I had a late appointment, since they had to cancel my previous appointment last minute.   I don't know if it was the combination of having the last appointment of the day and using a free coupon, but I was highly disappointed with my experience. The coupon said the value was $149 and the facial I received wasn't even worth $30. It was barely 30 minutes, with no steam (which I like), and nothing really special to write about.   The overall experience here was awkward and not like facials I've had in the past. The room felt sterile and was more like a doctors office than a "spa" Needless to say, I won't be returning, nor would I recommend to any friends. If they were smart they would've used that free offer to provide an amazing experience so I would return.
