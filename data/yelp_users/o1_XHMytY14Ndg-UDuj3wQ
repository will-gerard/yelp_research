This place is horrible. The only time this place might be satisfying is if I were completely stoned.   The sushi was worse than the stuff you buy from the grocery store.  The orange chicken was watery.  The teriyaki was dry.  There is nothing that would ever get me to come back to this place.

The only reason I give this place a 2 star is because the food is fantastic but the service is absolutely horrible. We have come to this place very regularly for years and the staff changes almost monthly and never improves. It's almost a breeding ground for terrible servers. We sat down today and ordered food and a margarita. By the time we had finished our food the waitress had still not returned to check on us or ask if we wanted to order another drink. I finally got up and walked to the bar where she was just chatting with a friend and was shocked that I wanted something and actually caught her slacking off. I wish I could include a picture of the entire place. There is a total of 3 tables and 2 servers. Not a lot for either of these people to take care of. I don't ask for a lot. I just want someone to stop by once in a while to see if my drink needs refilled or maybe I want another taco. We will never know because they never gave it a chance.

I have been a fan of this place since it opened. The Hangover Sandwich is fantastic. They are very consistent in the quality. On weekends you can expect a little wait, but it's well worth it. Every time I have family in town, this is a must.   And they just opened a new location in Phoenix right behind my work!!!   I highly recommend checking this place out.

Absolutely the worst service I have ever received. I ordered a combo which was supposed to come with hash browns. There were none in the bag so I asked her for them. She responds with "the cashier must have not have rang them up and that would cost more." She made me feel like it was my fault that the cashier messed up. After that she finally agreed to give me what I ordered. Now fast forward 15 minutes to when I got home. I take out the sandwich and find out its not even close to the one I ordered. I go back to this place and talk to the same horrible manager who proceeds to tell me that I must have ordered incorrectly. I respond with, "how is asking for a number 15 incorrect? The cashier even repeated my order back to me"  I understand that the cashier might have been new or pressed the wrong button but that doesn't mean that you can now blame the customer for her mistake. The manager then asked if I wanted to order the correct sandwich. I couldn't believe it. She didn't offer an apology or anything. I then decided I wanted my money back. This was just ridiculous. Since I drove back and only brought back the sandwich, she would only refund that part. She refused to refund my entire meal. So after all this I get the pleasure of going home and enjoying cold hash browns that somehow cost me $4. I will never go back to this place.

Went here for the first time and was completely satisfied with everything.   Had the calamari and a chicken sandwich. Calamari was excellent chicken was juicy.   The beer selection was great. The only downside was the beer prices. I highly recommend this place.

Excellent food for a reasonable price. I had the racecar sandwich and it was fantastic. The only complaint I have is that I wish the sides were larger. If you like spicy food, I highly recommend the spicy bbq sauce. I'm sure I will be going back many more times.

Absolutely amazing burger. I tried the Hatch Chili Burger and it was perfectly cooked. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots were an excellent side.   I highly recommend any burger lover to try this place.

I just purchased a groupon for a manicure for my girlfriend, when she gets there to make an appointment there is a handwritten sign on the door stating that they are not accepting groupons and to not come in and bother the stylists. I cannot believe how rude that sign is. I took a picture and will never send anyone there.

So...I tried it again....still not amazing. It's not terrible food, just not great.   This past Sunday I went to the Coach House to watch the niners game. My friends and I drove up there and parked in the dirt parking lot which is connected to the Coach parking lot. My girlfriend and her friend went over the Taco shop and got some tacos and a burrito to go. We then all went into the Coach and enjoyed the game. A few hours later we went to get into our car and it was gone. Apparently America's Taco Shop had all the cars towed. The tacos here are not worth the $75 towing charge. I was a patron at this establishment and will NEVER go back. I am glad to see that other people on here had the same issue and are voicing their anger as well.   America's Taco Company has made a fatal mistake. They should have put flyers on the cars warning people of the issue, not just had them towed. It could have been a great way for them to advertise their new location. Put a flyer on the cars that offers a free taco or something. Not everyone knows about this new place. Instead they decided to piss people off. They need to be careful who they piss off. The Coach House brings them a lot of business which will now be greatly diminished due to this. I used to tell people to just walk behind the bar and grab a taco. I will no longer be doing this.   I do NOT recommend going to this place.   Good Luck America's Taco Shop!

I can't rate this place low enough. I was a good customer of the old saltys. The old place was decent food, cheap drinks and good service. This new Saltys is terrible!!! I ordered a Coors light draft and it was 4.50. What the heck? My PBR was a small can and 3 bucks. I'm pretty sure this will be my last time here. Good bye Saltys and good luck staying open with all these bad reviews.
