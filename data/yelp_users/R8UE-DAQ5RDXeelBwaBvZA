We stayed here as part of our staycation to celebrate our anniversary and take a break from the kids. We were more than excited at the thought of sleeping in until 9 or so in a dark, cold hotel room. Unfortunately, the room did not allow that. Our room window was on the fourth floor facing the highway and there are only wooden shades, no curtains and we were blinded at 630 am by the amount of sunlight in the room. Additionally, we set the thermometer as low as it would go, 60 degrees and would guess the lowest the temp got in the room was 78. We liked the location and the pool, but since we were most looking forward to the room and we're disappointed I'm rating the hotel as poor.

I don't understand why anyone would choose to go to this overpriced ripoff over locally owned Harkins.   No discounts for students. Higher ticket prices in general. Literally the most expensive concession prices I've ever seen, more expensive than a sporting event or concert! Seats do not recline. Arms on seats are worn. Staff is made up of snotty teens with horrible attitudes! Never again!

My daughter likes this restaurant because of the planes. However, last week we went for the breakfast buffet on the weekend and had a very bad experience.  After getting biscuits and gravy from the buffet I found a long hair all in my gravy when I was back at the table, I literally didn't want to eat anymore. I went up to the buffet again for my child and saw they had either added more gravy to the pot or switched it out. This all happened after we had been given our check and our waiter never came back after I found the hair, which is fine, we were almost done and it was busy. When I went to the counter to pay I was asked how everything was and I told the woman, who's always the cashier there about the hair.  She then asked me if I told the waiter and I explained that he hadn't come back.   I understand this is a buffet and the hair may very well been from another customer. However, it was the total unprofessional manner in which the cashier chose to act that actually gave me a bad experience.  She continued to act as if everything was my fault because I didn't notify my waiter and she continued to lecture me about it without apologizing for the situation or offering anything to make it better. She left a worst taste in my mouth than the hair.

I specifically scheduled a cleaning and am a 1st-time patient. When I got there I waited 45 min to be seen, after getting x-rays I waited another 20 minutes in the chair to see the hygienist, who only "inspected" my teeth, told me I had minor periodontal disease in a few spots and then was told I needed to wait for the dentist. From there I waited even longer for the dentist, while listening to the staff argue about things not being done. I saw the dentist, was told I had no cavities and was told to go see the front desk. I said I scheduled a cleaning and the dentist stated they would check and see if it could be done today. I waited longer in the chair for an answer, the dental assistant then starting telling me in a very rude manner I needed to get up and I needed to wait in the waiting room because she needed to clean the room. I left and went into the waiting room where I was still awaiting my answer on if I would receive a cleaning which, is the reason I made the appt and took a day off work. I then spoke with another person of staff named Nicole, who was also very rude, she snapped at me that cleanings are not guaranteed (how would I know this?) and that they were trying to get in contact with the next patient to reschedule and they were doing all of this ton accommodate me (very rude with much attitude). It was decided that they could start my cleaning, do about 15 minutes then I would have to come back 1.5 hours later to finish. My appt was at 11 am, I left there at 1pm, had to stay in the area and wait until 2:30pm when I came back. I waited another 30 min to finish my cleaning and then was able to leave at 3:45 pm.  This office is so unprofessional and lacking any type of customer service. I was waiting before even seeing anyone and was made to wait even longer while they were insistent on taking other patients on time, instead of pushing them back as they had done for me.

I always go to this theater and love it!! I decided to go to AMC this weekend because they had a showtime that worked out better. Well, after being sooo disappointed with AMC, I now feel sooo appreciative of this great locally owned theater! They have the day care center, student and military prices, overall lower prices for tickets and concessions, seats recline, theaters are always clean, staff are always nice.
