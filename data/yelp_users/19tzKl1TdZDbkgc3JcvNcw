Excellent customer service! Thanks to Trini who took the time when I called the store to locate and  to pull a table and chairs patio set and have it on cart wrapped up and held for me until I could get there the next day to purchase it. Thanks also to Jose who helped us buy the floor model of a couch patio set and offered us 10% off! And last but not least, thanks to Steven and Mikeal for helping us load it all. We appreciate you all!

Food was great! Love the changing daily menu. If all vegetarian food was this flavorful I'd never need to eat meat. The 1/2 wrap + one side filled me up. The cold pasta all a vodka was super spicy and delicious. The only problem is their method of serving which creates a bit of a wait and  crowded line. Everyone is super friendly. I'll be back.

We could not have been happier with choosing CHoP for my mother's birthday celebration last night! I had reserved a large corner booth for the eight of us, which was ready and waiting when we got there. For the next two hours Chris and his staff doted on us! All of us loved our meals especially the wedge salad, the burgers, and the salmon. Make sure you leave room for the toffee bread pudding! It was delicious! The servers were all so friendly and attentive.  Thank you for making our night special! We will be back!

Whatever you do, don't buy furniture here!  I bought a sofa and recliner at the Tempe location on April 27.  It took over 6 weeks to get the furniture delivered due to their non-existent scheduling system.  The closest they can come to in scheduling a delivery in the day before, and then they can only tell you it will be sometime during a 9 hour period.  They ended up showing up with the furniture when I was not home and my teenage son had to handle it.  After finally getting the furniture delivered, we discovered the mechanism in the recliner did not work.  Again, we had to try and work with the customer service department, all of which barely speak or write English, to schedule a time for a technician to come out.  Again, took an afternoon off work, only to have him arrive at my house at 6pm.  He could not fix the chair.  A new mechanism had to be ordered.  He ordered it and I received a barely understandable email a day or two later telling me the new mechanism would be delivered to my home and that I should call them when I received it to schedule the tech to come out and install it.   The huge box arrived and we had to have it in our entryway for 3 weeks before a tech came out.  In order to finally get somewhat of an "appointment" we had to drive down to the store, and speak to the manager to get a response.   Today the tech finally came to fix the chair.  He had a drill and a wrench--that's it.  I have wood floors and he was going to work on the chair replacing the metal insides with no blanket or rug to protect my floor.   After replacing the mechanism, he figured out it was the wrong one.  I told him I wanted him to take the chair and I wanted a refund.   I called the store--which took multiple tries as their mail boxes are all full and they don't answer the phone.  The tech, Juan, and the person at the store, Perla proceeded to attempt to speak in Spanish regarding the issue.  I had to ask them to speak in English so I knew what was transpiring.  Perla said nothing could be done until the tech came in with a report, even though he was right there.  I asked to speak to the store manager.  Of course, he was not in the store.  At some point another employee got on the phone and tried to hang up on me.  He refused to give me his name.  He acted like I was being unreasonable for wanting to return the chair and that I wouldn't wait until the store manager called me back.   Mark, finally gave me his name, along with the store manager's name,  Al.  He refused to give me last names.  He promised the manager will call me back by 8:00pm tonight.  We'll see. So at this point, I have a chair that doesn't work, and that I no longer  want.
