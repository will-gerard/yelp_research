For a place called 'Bacon', they really need to work on their title dish.   I have been to this bustling Scottsdale joint two times now and each time left disappointed. While their breakfast is satisfactory, it is nothing to write home about. Bacon offers traditional breakfast options, and not really much else. You would think with a place called Bacon that they would manage to serve their title dish well enough to do their name proud. I found the Bacon on both visits to be luke-warm, dry and absent of any flavor, it was like eating tree-bark that had a mild essence of bacon.  The service was also mediocre, at best, on both occasions. The server noticed upon delivery of my food that cheese was missing from my eggs (as ordered), and without me prompting her, she brought the dish back to the kitchen. Sadly however, when she returned it was just a couple of shreds of cold cheese sprinkled on top (really? come on.).  Later when the waitress returned and saw my barely touched plate and asked if everything was fine, she did't really offer any solutions when I said it was simply "alright". Normally, I would be fine with this, but when a restaurant like "Bacon" is charging a $15 check for a really basic breakfast and coffee, I expect better service.  Sadly, I will not be returning to Bacon until I hear of some changes. Until then I recommend The Breakfast Club or Cafe Carumba in Scottsdale or Matt's Big Breakfast in Downtown Phoenix.

Great Prices, Even Better Food. I came here last week for lunch after being suggested to by an employee. Sandellas delicious variety of salads, paninis, and flat bread pizzas has had me coming again and again ever since! The prices are unbeatable for the quality of food, and for the price of a value meal at a fast food restaurant I get a delicious and healthy entree with chips and a drink. Sandellas is a real gem of a lunch place in Chandler. A++
