What a great bunch of people! Very nice to work with and very reasonably priced. I needed some work done on my wedding set & had taken my rings to a "big name" chain at the mall for an appraisal. They quoted me 4x's more than what Burland's charged me. Definitely will recommend this shop to all my friends and will use them again.

Boooo!!! This hospital stinks, not only is it on the far side of the moon (Mesa) they will not let you bring children under 13 in to visit patients.   My mom broke her hip and spent a week at Dignity Health/Chandler Regional Medical Center. They were awesome! My mom did not wake up immediately after surgery and was moved to their trauma ICU for a week. Needless to say, it was an emotional and exhausting week for all of us, yet the staff at Chandler not only took exceptional care of my mom, they made ALL of us feel welcome and cared for. Then mom got transferred to Banner today and now they will not let her see her 14 month old granddaughter because of "flu season". The nurse was really rude about it too. I hope they transfer my mom somewhere else. Do not send your loved ones here. You'll regret it.

Normally, love this store & have been a member for decades, but was very disappointed with the woman who "helped" us last Saturday in Women's Clothes. She has horrible customer service skills. Told us that, since there weren't any listed on the website, ALL REI's were sold out of a parka I'd tried on 2 days prior at their store. You mean to tell me that your location sold 10 North Face women's parkas in 48 hours when it's 80 degrees outside??? This was after she's told us they'd just shipped all their winter stuff to Denver the previous day. Never offered to call the other store & ask them to hold a jacket for me. Instead, she claimed all REI's were sold out of the black jackets b/c the website only showed blue & squid red. I explained that the website hadn't shown black inventory on the same day I'd tried on the coat at their store (according to her, it should have shown up on the website inventory) She still claimed all stores were sold out. Never mind, I bought it online from one of your competitors and it was cheaper too.
