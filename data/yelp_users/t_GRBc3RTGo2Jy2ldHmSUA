This place is quickly becoming my secret obsession!  Love me these tamales!! The chicken mole is an absolute must when they have it.

Horrible.  Went in looking for a gift salesgirl said buy anything pink and you get free socks.   Picked out a gift waited in a line that there was no organization to with people cutting in.  Got to the counter and the girl rings me up and I ask where are my socks and she shrugs and says oh we ran out awhile ago.  Got to love the communication or lack there of with this organization.  I won't be back.  Hello Lucy and Athleta can't wait to become a regular with you guys!!
