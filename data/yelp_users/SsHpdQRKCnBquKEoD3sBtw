I love that I can pop in this place on my lunch hour and grab a fresh goodie. I absolutely love the pretzels and their pretzel croissants! I have had their Apple dumplings, to die for! There is a hint of almond in there that is so delicious. The store area is cute and has many German treats, including candies and mixes. Every time I have come here I have always been treated wonderfully. The ladies that work there are very nice and helpful.

This is a great place for lunch. I always get the 2 slice and drink special. Can't go wrong with awesome pizza.

Stopped off in the deli area for some "breakfast" and picked up vegan chicken salad, a corn salad, and a sweet corn tamale.   WOW was the chicken salad amazing!!! vegan or not, this stuff tasted like the real deal. I am not vegan but I am always willing to try new things and boy am I glad I did. It is a bit pricy but well worth it because it does not have all the "bad" things like cholesterol in it.   After having a bit to eat, you can walk around and do some shopping. I like the way this place is set up. It is good for morning brunch and then grabbing your weekly food.

This place was close to home so I would be here every other week or so. Good rolls and the staff was great!! Not much of a  selection for happy hour but the regular menu offers a variety of flavors.

What a great place. The location is tucked back in this little strip mall area. The creamy broccoli soup was wonderful and I really enjoyed my Mediterranean wrap. Will keep this on my list for future lunch spots.

I love this place. I go here often but this last time I went to see a friends art they had on display and of course for the Shwarma (spelling?) I tend to order mine with no tomatoes and the sauces on the side. I can't help it, I like to deconstruct the wrap.   Big fan of this place and the service is always top notch.

If you are looking for good sushi, eat here! They have a great assortment rolls.   I have been here several times and each time has been a good experience.   They have a great Happy Hour with a pretty decent menu to choose from. They have new rolls often

What can I say about Massage by Page? She is amazing!!! She really takes the time to talk to you and discuss your treatment. She asks about what issues you are having and what areas are in need of any extra TLC. Page is very professional and will make sure you are comfortable throughout your entire session.  Her new location at Healing Edge on McDowell in Avondale is beautiful and really incorporates her whole philosophy.

Maybe it was because it was late, or it just wasn't a good night. I wasn't really a fan of the barrito I got, and the seating area was cheap plywood tables that need to be sanded down. The employees were very nice and talkative.

This place is my go to lunch spot. From their perfectly cooked fish on the Blackened Tilapia Caesar salad, to the tender juicy pork in the Pernil Tacos, I love this place!  The location is a bit small but the food is worth waiting for.   Service at lunch is spot on and all the servers are friendly and can answer any question you may have. Parking kinda sucks at lunch time unless you work downtown, you can park in the garage under Cityscape but get there early or you will be driving around for a while looking for a non-reserved spot (this is the only reason they get 4 stars).

Being from the Chicago area it is great to have this place so close to home! I have been here a few times now and each time has been a great experience. The food is spot on and service is exceptional. I usually get the Italian Beef because well, it's great!! Always dipped with giardiniera peppers and a side of extra juice. Fries are fries, they are good here but its really hard to mess up fries. I have had their Chicago Dog once and it is a true Chicago Dog! One of the best parts of coming here is the Jays chips! If you are a Chicagoan you know what I am talking about, when they say "just can't stop eating 'em!" they mean it.  It's nice seeing a lot of the familiar street names around the place and images of different "hot" spots from Chicago. the decor is clean and the seating is very open and nice. You are not on top of the next table or having to hear everyone conversations.  Keep up the great service delicious food.

If you have not  been to Little Miss BBQ yet, you need to drop everything and go now! I am not a BBQ expert by far, but this place has the best BBQ I have ever had in my life! I am partial to the brisket but have had tried several of their other tasty treasures, (still need to get there for the short ribs). The brisket is melt in your mouth tender, ribs have the perfect texture and bit. The sides include cheesy jalapeno grits are creamy and delicious with the right amount of heat. Baked beans, WOW beans have never tasted so good, they add brisket to them! I like the coleslaw but if I'm going to eat BBQ I will choose the grits and beans first. There is a reason this place sells out everyday.

I'm so disappointed! I was hoping this place would have been a great Friday night happy hour dinner stop to add to my list but I was a bit to hopeful I think.   A group of four of us went to check it out and let me say, the service was really not that great and the food was mediocre at best. While I'm a fan of a nice tattoo, I have several myself, I didn't need to see the what looked like a homemade one, on our waiters chest. Dude, wear a tshirt or button up your shirt it is not a good thing to be showing off.   I asked the waiter for recommendations since we had never been there and he told us that the menu was basically a work in progress because they were still testing items to see what fit. Ok, I get that but still never got a recommendation from him. One friend ordered the sweet potato fries and I ordered the poppers for appetizers. They were brought out and the fries were well over cooked, they were dark brown and looked soggy, like they had been cooked then sat and cooked again when someone finally ordered them. They were sent back and a new plate was brought out that actually looked edible. The poppers were good but a tad greasy. We had to ask for small plates a few times so were could all share the appetizers, also.    On to our entrees. Two from the group ordered off the starter section and the other two ordered from the normal entree section. In my experience when tables do this the food is brought out all together. Well the starter orders were brought out in a timely manor but the entrees took another 20 minutes to come out. So while one group got to eat their meal the other two had to sit and watch.   The actual food: The citrus shrimp was ok not very citrusy and the bruschetta honestly, should have been called flimsy bread with toppings. In my experience bruschetta is usually toasted bread with toppings.  This bread was neither toasted nor the standard nice artisan  bruschetta bread. The homemade chips were good, there was a puddle of grease in the bottom of the bowl that could have fried up another batch, gross! And she had ordered the mix (sweet potato and regular) and only received the regular.   During our 20 minutes wait for the rest of our meals, our waiter brought out a plate of rustic fries for us to munch on while we waited. Really, I don't want your fries, I'd like my entree to eat while the rest of my party has their meals. Finally the last two meals came out and for the price we were not impressed. My friend ordered the siracha tilapia and I got the battered cod. The tilapia was a thin piece of fish and looked dry, by this time she wasn't feeling well so she just asked for a box to take it home so I don't know how it was. The cod was ok, they were very small pieces for the price. I say that again because I can get what I ordered anywhere else on a Friday night as an all you can eat for less then what I paid and have better service and bigger pieces of actual fish. The batter I will say was good.   During our meal, a guy came up to our table (I'll assume it was a supervisor or manager) and just kind stood there hovering, not saying anything or asking how our meal was, he just stood there! It was very awkward, so I turned and looked at him after about a minute or so, he asked how everything was and we were all just kinda shrugged. That is when my friend had to ask for a box a second time because our waiter hadn't brought her one yet (after about 10 minutes) He really didn't say anything and rolled his eyes as he walked away. He did not ask why we were not happy or if there was anything he could do. He brought her the box and walked away again. 5 minutes later our waiter shows up with a box.   We got our bill figured out what we owed and left. If it were not for the company I was with, this night would have been one of the worst. Customer service is everything and if you don't have that you will not be in business long. After being open for 2 months, you should have a set menu, not still getting the feel for what you should be serving.
