I love living here!  First of all, the staff: Jeana, Leslie, Cici, and Katie are AMAZING! Jeannette will be missed by everyone, though :(  You cannot find a better place for the money and location. Period. Yes, it's a little dated, but they make up for it with excellent office staff and maintenance workers.  I adore almost every resident I've met here,and I love the rules about noise level - and that they enforce them! I'm a student, so I need to have peace and quite when I'm studying.   Even though having to haul my laundry to the laundry rooms is kind of a pain, I do appreciate that the machines take credit/debit cards so I don't have to carry a ton of quarters as well.  One of my favorite things is that they have a water filter unit by the main laundry room $0.25 for a gallon of cold, pure water right next to me is a HUGE plus.  The very few times I've had to go to the office to address an issue, they've been polite, understanding, and they took care of it ASAP.  I'm pretty sure that I'll be living here until I am able to buy a house.

With the new management, this place has become a lot less awesome. I don't know where they got thus new manager from, but she needs some lessons in honesty, professionalism, and compassion.  I'll be leaving once my lease is up.... If not sooner.

I should probably give this a 5 star rating because it has millions of beers, very friendly bar tenders and live music that's always neat.  But, the hipster vibe makes me throw up in my mouth, so I have to take a star away.  If you like beer, live music, friendly/prompt service, and are also a hipster, you will LOVE THE SOCKS OFF THIS PLACE.  If you like beer, live music, friendly/prompt service, and are NOT a hipster, you will still really like it.

This place is AMAZING!  I found this place by accident when I went into what I thought was the side door for Dilly's Deli and got a super happy surprise.  Their portions are huge, and really reasonably priced.  Also, I like how every meal comes with a chocolate-covered strawberry.   The staff and cooks are friendly and willing to accommodate dietary needs (I'm allergic to wheat).  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
