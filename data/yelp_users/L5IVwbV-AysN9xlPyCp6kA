Just had to complain about our server, who ignored my wife's drink order, then after I reordered for her brought it in a dirty glass. That's sad because we really like this place and we hate leaving a bad taste in their mouths with our complaint.

I visited Scratch for brunch yesterday, May 18th.  I had a goat cheese omelette with bacon, and the fetching Mrs. Smith had the Eggs Royale.  The omelette was served with hash browns and a salad, all delicious!  The goat cheese combined with the bacon in the omelette made it extremely flavorful.  But the best thing was the service.  The staff was exceedingly friendly, with just the right mix of checking to see how we were doing and if we needed anything, and just leaving us alone to enjoy our breakfast. And their smiles made our Saturday.  :)  Please visit Scratch and enjoy!

Small storefront coffee shop, but very comfortable. Stopped in during lunch to recharge and catch up on email, discovered a very pleasant place to take a break.  One of the other reviews observes that the owner, Aisha, loves coffee and this is very true.  She is enthusiastic about sharing good coffee, fresh roasted and flavorful, with her customers.  And the coffee is, indeed, good.  Aisha and her husband are from Ethiopia, and they serve Ethiopian coffee exclusively.  They import the beans green, and also supply to a local roaster.  If you're in the neighborhood of 44th St. and Thomas, head over to A.T. for a well-deserved break.  For the quality of the product and the owner's enthusiasm, four stars.

The bacon came late and not crispy as ordered, and the hash browns are actually crispy shoestring fries. But the waitstaff are very friendly and eager to serve, so it feels like they're really trying, but haven't quite figured out how to do breakfast. There's a lot of potential here, but they have some work to do.
