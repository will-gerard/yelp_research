Fate is the kind of place that makes you feel classy while eating/drinking. They have a great selection of wine and liquor plus a bunch of beers you don't see many other places.  Just be ready to spend a bit more than usual on drinks, a glass of wine will run you about $10.  It's got a real cozy feel inside... when I say cozy, I mean, it's pretty damn small. But it's got a good atmosphere.The outside is now fantastic with this great bar, more seating, and DJ booth in a weird little loft thing overlooking the whole place.  The food is excellent. I've never had a bad experience. I'm definitely addicted to the ying yang noodles with tofu, but the Thai coconut curry is in a really close second place.

Coming from the east coast, I am a bit snotty when it comes to sushi. Every place I tried in Arizona didn't even mildly live up to my standards. Then I found Sakana's. They have the freshest fish in town, decent prices, and really good service. They even have the grills to do it up Japanese steak house style.  Try the mahi mahi tempura roll, it's my favorite. The baked scallops roll is phenomenal too. I definitely suggest sitting at the sushi bar the first time there, the cooks are really entertaining and a lot of fun.   Also, if you're a big beer fan, this place has asahi black, which I normally can't find at many restaurants.

Pranksters is the kind of place you go to have a drink. No frills, no hype, just a straight up hole in the wall kind of bar. This is the kind of place that you can show up in sweatpants and still be one of the best dressed people there.  The drinks are cheap, the staff is friendly, and the food is some of the best bar food i've had in a while. The grilled cheese is phenomenal. There's a good selection of beers on tap/bottle and there's a special drink/shot for every day of the week. There's a big contingent of regulars that are always around and always ready to provide entertainment to all. Dogs and people alike are welcome.  This joint is my Cheers.

I took my cat, Moe, to get a haircut at this Petsmart. He's a total fuzz ball. So I drop him off and head down the road with a friend for dinner.   About 30 minutes later, I get a call from some kid there that there's been an emergency and that I needed to get there immediately. Freaking out, I get there in 3 minutes, only to find my cat in the corner of the store hissing with a couple of employees scared to go near him. Afraid of a 10 lb, claw less, half shaved cat. Isn't that their jobs?  In the end, my cat had a weird mullet and then to even it out, he ended up getting shaved and looked stupid for a month.

This bar is a dirty, hole-in-the-wall, jacked up tiki bar that smells kind of funky. It used to be a favorite of mine because you could smoke inside. Now that you can't, it's lost a lot of its appeal. It's cash only, the atm's usually broken, and the ladies bathroom is... well...   BUT (yes, there is a but) the drinks are always strong and cheap. It's also really good for people watching on a Friday night.

This place is one of the worst sushi joints in town. Why is everything covered in their stupid sauce (which is just watered down siracha, by the way)?   The quality of fish is horrendous. The tuna was old/dull looking, the salmon seemed rotten. I got a little happy when i saw they had yellow tail only to be served a weird colored, trash smelling piece of sashimi. What a let down.   I hate being so negative, but I really get mad with bad sushi and this place was bad.

I love love love Durants. I feel like I'm back in the 50's, eating steak with the likes of Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. I love the ambiance, it's super cozy and comfy. They've got these great leather booths, cool old school portraits, and waiters in little tuxedos. I also love the fact that you can enter through the kitchen, giving you that goodfellas vibe when they walk through the kitchen of the copa.  There's a fantastic wine and booze selection (of course, the first thing I look for) and FANTASTIC food. For starters, the waiter will bring you a little plate of fresh veggies and this amazing bread with a garlic herb topping. Then, I totally suggest getting the mushrooms as a side. They are awesome, in this cream sauce that is indescribable. I always get the filet (medium rare) with the garlic mashed potatoes.  LOVE IT!! really good place for a date, a small party, or just a fanciful dinner. Did i say that i LOVE IT??? It is kind of expensive, but completely worth the price. You are guaranteed to leave satisfied.

Saturday night, reservations for 15 at 8:30. We arrived at 8:35 (damn Central construction) to find that our reservations were already gone. After some "discussion" with the staff, I got them to give us a table for 10 and a couple of extra cushions. Not too great of a start, but I tried to keep an open mind.  The food: kinda disappointing. We ordered the hummus/pita, the garlic rosemary fries, and the sweet potatoe fries for apps. The hummus wasn't too bad, but I wouldn't say it was any better than the stuff you get at any grocery store. They gave us a huge heaping helping of it, but only 7 pita triangles. Then they charged us a ridiculous amount for 7 more. The garlic fries were, to say the least, GARLICY! I love garlic, but this was a little too much! The sweet potato fries were good, but the sauce that came along with them was basically frosting in a cup (not my thing, but other people liked it). After that, I gave up on the food and tried to focus on the important things, like the drinks.  The drinks were pretty good, but expensive. A manhattan ended up costing $13.50 and a martini was at least $9.50. I ordered the pear martini, which sounded good in the description... not my cup of tea! They had dried pear in the bottom of the glass which ended up looking like (and I apologize for being gross) the intestine of a mouse. The drink was super sugary and nothing I'd order again.  But i must say: It was nicely decorated, the service was okay, and had ample parking. But I don't think it will be a place I will frequent, only if my friends make me again.

I love this place. It's great for the following reasons:  1) super chill, laid back feel 2) AWESOME jukebox 3) cheap drinks!! 4) you can actually have a conversation in there  So to go in a little more detail about point number 3... my first time there, I ordered my regular at a new place, whiskey and coke. The bartender pulled out a pint glass, filled it 3/4 full with whiskey, and charged me the price that small dixie cup drink at any bar in scottsdale would run you. FANTASTIC!  'nuff said.

In three words: not too shabby.  I've been weary with Chinese delivery in Phoenix so testing this place out was a big step for me.  And while I am still not a PHX Chinese food lover yet, Chen & Wok helped better my view.   The crab puffs and vegetable lo mein are great. My friend got the Sesame Chicken and wasn't too impressed...  It wasn't that horrible but I wouldn't recommend ordering it. The egg rolls were decent, but not the best. The thing that made it for me was the egg drop soup. I love it, but i hate the stuff you get from most places that has a consistancy of snot. C & W's egg drop is light and liquidy, like soup, not ooze. It was tasty, with mushrooms, peas, and carrots.   The best thing about them: they told us the food would take an hour, they were at my house in about 30 min. So yeah, I'll probably order from them again, unless someone in yelp land lets me know about a better spot.

Take it from a real live Indian who used to live in New Delhi: this is the best, most authentic, just like mom makes it food in phoenix. And the groceries are good too - this is one of the few places in the Valley I can get a Thums Up (if you don't know what that is, you best find out!!).  Great selection of namkeen (salty snacks) and decent fresh asian veggie section (kerela, persian cucumbers, daikon, the works). I love going there, pickin up my faves, and having a quick bhel puri. :)   Yes, all these things I have mentioned above may not be the mainstream type of thing, but seriously, TRY THEM OUT! You're missing out if you don't!

I agree with Sheila... this place is better than Panda Express. But in the way that manslaughter is better than murder. Both are bad, but one has a lesser sentence.

okay, so i know that reviewing a medical establishment is weird, but i had to sing my praises of this place. I have felt like crap for the last few days and tried every over the counter drug that I could cram into myself. Finally, I got kicked out of work yesterday for fear that my germs were contaminating everyone. I googled urgent cares and found this one had the best reviews.  I got there, expecting a hole in the wall place like other urgent cares, but instead found a pretty nice facility on the 2nd floor of a shopping plaza. Everything was computerized, even registration. They got me in within 7 minutes. Then, with their state of the art equipment, they took my blood pressure, tempurature, and all the other vitals in like 2 minutes.  The doctor came in 5 minutes later and didn't do any of the lame bull**** that you have to go through, she just checked a couple of things, told me what was wrong, and gave me drugs.  All in all, it took a total of 45 minutes and I was on my way home with my codine cough syrup and a bunch of anti biotics. Definitely go here if you get sick, it's quick and easy.

what can I say about Glam... well, i really, really despise it. Every time I go there, I regret the decision. And in my grandiose style, I'm going to say why in a list:  1) Cash only!! But listen to this, the bartender will take your debit card, charge you a fee, and give you cash, which you can then use to buy drinks from the same bartender that just did the whole transaction. WHY????   2) The location kinda blows. It's in a weird strip mall across from another strip mall. Have you ever driven by there in the day time? It's shady then, imagine at night time.  3) too hipster. I feel like I am not allowed there as I work for the man, do not wear black leggings, or have razor cut bangs. I, in my mall clothing and "mainstream" style, stick out like a sore thumb.  4) The music is just a little off.... ii dunno how to say what I am thinking, it's just off.  Okay, the floor is fancy. That's about it.  (sorry, I'm a bar snob and Glam deserves my wrath)

Okay, so as a person of Indian descent, I had to comment on Tandoori Times. It's damn good! I took my parents and 5 friends out there, we ordered basically one of everything and a ton of Kingfishers (best Indian beer ever) and spent less than $200. Lunch is not too shabby either, any one of their wraps hits the spot.... they're extra yummy because they use naans as the wrap.  My mother, who despises going to Indian restaurants, even liked it.
