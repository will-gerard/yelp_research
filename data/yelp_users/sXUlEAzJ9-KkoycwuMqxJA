Not really "gourmet" Chinese, but it is good. We have ordered from them several times now, and have not been disappointed. We have tried a variety of choices from the menu, they're all good. Choose what sounds best to you and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. No, it's not the best Chinese food we've ever had, but we do like it. We will continue to order from them as long as we're in this area. We always get delivery.

Awful service! Want some bread, or a glass of water? You'd do better to run to Jack in the box and come back. The food is good, but I won't be back. Honestly, I've had better food at much lower prices too.

When I took my last car to Toyota for a battery replacement they charged a fortune for the battery and labor. I asked them to connect another battery to save my settings, which they said they would. When my car was done they advised they were unable to save the settings because there was no room to connect a spare battery?!? This time I bought my own battery online, and got a MUCH better battery than the crap Toyota sells for less money. The guys at Honest 1 Auto Care Glendale AZ connected a battery saver, saved all my settings, and installed the new battery in about 10 minutes for only $10! I highly recommend you to all my friends, family, and customers.

We had a few general pests, and yesterday killed a pretty good size spider. I called Rich and he had Angelica out today. I opened the door and she said "So, you're having a problem with Brown Recluse spiders?" No, I don't think so. And she pointed out a web 6 inches from my head! Yikes! We had them all over the outside and even a few inside. Yes, that nasty one we killed was a brown recluse. She also found a lot of desert crickets. That's their food source. Rich and Angelica know their stuff! She pointed out all the webs that I never noticed. She explained what they eat, how and where they live, what their bite is like, everything. She's a walking bug encyclopedia. She killed the spiders, and removed their food source. I'm still a little freaked out, but at least I know they're gone for now. Other companies do a good job at killing bugs, but never give the education we just received. They were on time, reasonably priced, did a thorough inspection, and we're already seeing dead or dying bugs. It appears they know how to treat the pests as well as the complete lifecycle of the pest. Well done Angelica!  Update: Their service did NOT remove the spiders. After further investigation, we learned we did NOT have Brown Recluse spiders, but rather Wolf or a similar funnel web spider. Brown Recluse spiders are hunters. They do not build complex webs, and remain close to the ground. BrenCon only sprayed the Windows and entry points, not the baseboards. When I spoke to them about the recurrent spider problem, they offered to respray but only the same areas. They said they do not spray baseboards, claiming it's ineffective. We also had many tiny little "dust web" spiders on the walls. Even after BrenCon treated, we were killing about 4 per day.  I called License 2 Kill. Brian treated both inside and out including the baseboards and even power sprayed the garage. He did more work for less money, and our spider problem is solved. We have not seen ANY pests since License 2 Kill treated our home.  Sorry BrenCon, you misinformed us and failed to treat the problem. We believe your offer to re-treat would not have made any difference. One call to your competition completely solved the problem. It's unfortunate we had to pay again, but Brian advised us that we should not have any trouble for months, and will not require monthly treatments as your company suggested.
