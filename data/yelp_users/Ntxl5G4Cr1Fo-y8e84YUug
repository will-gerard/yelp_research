I am not sure that some of these people were at the right place. I have never had a bad meal or experience there. All food is homemade including the salsa. The grilled shrimp are amazing! If you order beans, rice and salsa..mix altogther..aka: "the mixture"...that's all you need on any given hangover or non-hanging day...it's like crack salsa....It has always been very clean and great service...go for breakfast or lunch before 11:15..then after 2...otherwise you will wait a very very very long time...or dinner you can always get a seat....LOVE YOU JUAN!

Really LGO?! I quit going to my neighborhood spot because of all the "affliction wearing douche's" that have over run every area of my neighborhood. A friend invited yesterday for lunch,so we jammed on our cruisers..well, you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday. I was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months..months I tell you. I order from a chipper little gal...I asked if I could have it open faced. She didn't think it would be a problem...wrong answer! The kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before..oh yes they have and use to get it right..guess the new peeps from down south didn't get the how to memo.  The 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top...Really?? I took it back..a different girl said what's wrong with that? Apparently everything you nit wit! So, they remade it, check my photo..this is what I got back..except I added the zig zag of color just so I could choke it down. The "manager type" person actually handed this to me and said, "your remake" Really? But I was so hungry and frustrated, I took it..not even any fruit..so for $7.50 I got a plate of tuna poop. 3 bites later, it hit the trash receptacle. Don't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over..cuz it just ain't happening right. I was here a couple of months ago, ordered potato leek soup, came out curdled and cold..an employee walking by my table said, "wow that doesn't look right, gross" wouldn't take it off the bill and was like, "glad I'm not eating it". And I'm glad I'm not eating here anymore and that Bertha's and Acacia Cafe have moved into the neighborhood. The people watching may not be the same, but the food is great, service outstanding and even better prices. What a shame!

JT, JT, JT....OMG...the wings will make you take flight. They are the most delicious little mouth delights. Serious ..dude should have a solid gold chicken wing out front. They are grilled to perfection, the degree of heat or flavor is right everytime. The bar is fun, fun, fun! The regulars may look you over a time or two..but hey I'm good lookin so I don't mind. lol. The tacos rock out Thursday night.  The only problem with JT's is, he's not open on Sunday for football..and that pisses me off every time I remember on hangover Sunday, that I forgot to get them on Saturday. Damnit, I hate that I have to go there twice a week.  Cuz he is open for Monday night football..oh ya.....screw  it..I'm going right now...c ya...

First time here last night, although I have heard about it for years. Eclectic patrons for sure. Which is a nice change of pace. The service was outstanding! Thank you! The lamb beyond rock star! The bouillabaisse was decent, could have used more varieties of fish and a smidge of wine and depth, however I finished the whole bowl. The chocolate creme brulee was simple and decadent. I loved that I had my 11 year old daughter and they did not blink an eye. However, she can decipher any menu and order her own meal accordingly. She said their lamb ranks in the top her  2 in the valley. It is a sweet sexy people watching get to know your neighbor ( if you want) or it can be your lust-full off beaten spot. I may get a driver (tinted windows and all) just to take me out of my hood to hang here. It made me want get to know the regulars, so they think I'm one. Do I think he could get a bit complex? Yes. But then again, simplistic ingredients with mind provoking art, a warm atmosphere and a chef and his wife with passion..all day long! I'm just sorry I did not try it sooner. After reading their story a few minutes ago and their passion for charity...I may beg them to be my friend! Good peeps! Hands down!

In my hood. Always consistent good food. Service has gotten better. The Miami Ham ( Cubano) hello! All day long! My daughter loves their Chick Noodle Soup every time. The place is simple and clean.  Here at least once a week. The egg salad sandwich is just like my Mom use to make. They have an amazing marble rye. The Sunday morning specials are awesome!! It's always busy these days, but I'll wait. It's nice when people know your name. :)

It must be hit or miss right now with the new opening..I hope everyone gives it another try as this place is in my hood and I can walk or bike here..although can you get a BWI, or a WWI? I did have a friend get a skateboarding while intoxicated ticket once...uhm? Anyway..I have been here 3 times since it re-opened. Dig the happy hour! really dig the FULL bar selection now! Dig Dig the new outside back patio! I like the eclectic food mix..a little something for everyone..where else can you get sushi, deviled eggs with caviar and turkey meatloaf? Come  on people...times are a changing..I hated that they closed for a bit, and I am very unhappy about the pappardelle pasta  being pulled (please bring it back!!!) and that the celery Caesar use to be all celery...but I'm opening up my expectations of their struggling identity and am willing to frequent them till they get it perfect again. The music is divine and acoustics seem to be better...I like ya..if that counts for anything!

Okay..so I hate Costco, thought I would hate Bevmo..cuz I am just not an O at the end kinda gal,,,,except of coarse ..the Big OOOOOOOOOOO, oh geez..got lost there a sec...okay..so the only reason I am reviewing this place is for the amazing Vodka called Baojing Vodka!!! Each small batch undergoes unique filtration through 168 carats of diamonds. The number 168 symbolically represents being on the road to infinite prosperity in Chinese custom. So, it may be distilled over 168 rats ass cracks, but it's still ridiculous! I don't know if it's the diamonds or the hallucinogenics they put in it..but you gotta try it. Seriously..I have been experimenting on my friends..well ya in that way too..but this time with the vodka...they all say..holy moly ...did you slip something in my drink...uhmm..that would be a negative..it's the VODKA darling and my dreamy eyes...I can't find it on a menu..it's not at Sportsman's..hello fuckers..I asked you to order this like a month ago..try and support the little guy..and what do they do? Make you drive your Rover across town, spend more gas money, so I have less on alcohol..you assholes!...no all kidding aside...I hate Bevmo..except for this one hot ass guy that works there, long hair like 21..plays in a band...sick hot ...oh fuck..I just realized I do like Bevmo....try the Vodka..you won't be sorry..let me know...Sorry Jewel of Russia..you are now my second favorite vodka. Cheers!!

We ate here this past Saturday night. Because I read that it was small, I did call for a reservation and they wrote me down. Which was nice, as it was steadily busy..so we did not have to wait long for a table since we called. I had my 7 year old daughter with..she loved the calamari and the bread lasted all of 1 minute. She also devoured my ceasar salad and the penne ala vodka...and she is a noodle/butter/garlic gal...so it was so nice to see her eat so much. Although I went home hungry! It's nice and loud which makes taking kids there perfect..not that you can get crazy..but it's not too have to hush them all the time. Other diners were super friendly and every one spoke with everyone else on there. The owner...yummy! His accent and friendliness...oh ya! BYOB...but so worth taking your own wine to go with the good food. Lights could be a touch more dim..I usually stick with the same thing where ever I go..but I will be going here weekly till I try it all..then decide my fave!

Noca, Noca, Noca...I've been wanting to try you for a while..but with child in tow..I was sceptical about trying you out....do I heart you to death right now? yes! K...so, let's rock the nitty gritty...I ate there a few hours ago and HAD to share...   When I walked in, they totally didn't even bat an eye that my daughter(8) was with me...patrons however gave me "the look"...little did they know she was totally in the kitchen later with the chef makin their little cloud of heaven...   Ok..so the most phenom wait / bus staff ever! EVER!!!! I applaud you!! If I could have raised a glass to all of you and thought the some what persnickety crowd would follow I would have. But , you know the "Arcadia crowd"... God forbid..they acknowledge where they came from and may be again ...anyway..hat's off to the training and ridiculous management skills you have developed!   Like I always tell anyone I have ever dated...it's the small things that count ( d--- exclude) and attention to detail ...NOCA covers it all.... the teeny mad hatter tea cups with soup and the perfect olive oil dipping trays.. I don't heart much these days....serious..check this sh-- out..fo real!   If I could put up with the dbag letch next to me for this....you know ..;or please know,..NOCA deserves a visit.   The kitchen was a tad slow, but they were slammed all at once..and it's actually nice to have a slow meal, and give each coarse the attention it deserves...they made up for the wait, by bringing Little Tea Cup's of Pea Soup, and Corn Soup, which I snagged from my daughter...then a bowl of tomato gazpacho..(which I couldn't eat, as I am allergic to tomatoes), the waitress did not bat an eye..she whisked it away...and replaced it with an asparagus toasted pine nut salad..yummy! (All of this was complimentary)..   I had an Ultimate Vodka Martini..fabu! Nice, Cozy  little 6 seat bar..if the dining room looks crowded, look a little further back to your left and see if you can squeeze in there..good seats and a bird eye view of the crowd.   k...so..the lobster ( pronounced) LOBSTAAAAA roll only on Wed. ..I was all trying to be healthy and not eat as a sandwich, at 1st...and it was ok...then I picked it up and had the whole enchilada ....f--- me all the way to heaven and back...you have no idea...I thought about not telling you for like 2 point 4 seconds flat..then decided if you want to have the big "O"..get off your ass and go....just stuff the big ass delight in your face..boss, date, Mom, lookin at you...doesn't matter ..you will thank me later.   I have had to cut a lot of food out of my life lately...but NOCA was like ...whatever..bring it on bitch...Thank you for rockin my pallet tonight!   The chef...so inventive on every level....the food speaks volumes... but what rocked me was the manager asking my daughter to meet the chef and go in the kitchen to help make the little puffs of heaven .... wait for it....wait for it....home made right then and there-COTTON CANDY! My all time favorite childhood treat. I renamed them Rockin Heaven Puff's last night. They bring them out after your meal....and they'll bring you 2..not that I would know... or anyone else they were gone so fast..I think I licked the bowl...oh geez, do over.  NOCA....you are the date I dream about!  If yelp had an "O" rating ...you would have it tonight!

I heart you in every way possible..was it because my 1st meal, after a 60 day 500 calorie a day diet , that  I had mac and cheese with lobtsaaaa? No, it was that walking in, you captured  a small part of my heart and soul ...The experience made me feel that's it's ok to be happy in this economy and ok to pay for great food and service, and that the artsy fartsy table looking your way ..just doesn' t get you, but you don't care.  Tuck you R it! Thank you...plz don't abuse my very fave new spot of ALL time other than Back Street Wine Bar....their dog rocks! The cat ouside at Tuck...super sweet...anyhow...thank you for helping me enjoy food again and want to actually recommend clients and friends..Simplicity and comfort Chaz..this is the spot!

I obviously had not had as much to drink or smoke as the previous reviewers when I decided to try The Parlor 2 weeks ago. It has the potential(bones) to be a quaint mod place....get rid of the servers, food and shit alcohol selection and it would be better than it is now. I can take the worst parking in the world for an outstanding place. This ain't it. Where to start, where to start???  1. The hostess moved like a barnacle as well as the wait staff. They were either all stoned on non-medical grade weed or were told to look and act aloof, disgusted and put off by the customers. It was bordering on comical.  2. I hate when new places open in the neighborhood expect you to pay high prices for food items and then have shit alcohol choices. We aren't by ASU. If we can afford your restaurant, we can afford higher end alcohol. Remember you are serving the publics taste, not your own. Do the research on high end, hell I would even take midiocre, alcohol choices and present them. You have such a varied menu, but then no choice of vodka..and no organic. Wine list sucks too!  3. It took 15 minutes to get a server and there were 10 tables open. I counted. Then she said I'll be right back..10 minutes later..then she only took our drink order, after she had to go see what kind of vodka they carried.  4. The worst ceasar salad I have ever had. EVER! It tasted like the tangy heel of a cheap shoe.  5. The cheese meat platter was a joke. They cut the meat in big slices for you, but not the hard cheeses and they don't label or tell you which is which... or give you a hard cheese slicer. NICE! 6. Our server came back after 15 minutes of getting our food, just in enough time for us to ask fo the check and get the F...out of there.   We then proceeded to Hula's Modern Tiki for the rest of our dinner, since we were still starving due to the fact that I was worried, that as slow as the wait staff was, that our dinner would spoil on the walk from the kitchen to our table and we would then have a hospital visit.  I'm not real keen on hospital food, but it would be a grade up from here.   In conclusion, if you don't understand good design, like less then sub -parr food, but believe you need to be seen in the new "it" place...just cuz...then go for it.   Now Hula's Modern Tiki on the other hand....reviewing soon.

Tommy ..you aren't two tone..(for the older and wiser) you aren't even one for that matter. I was actually not going to Yelp your ass. Then I came home, had to sit on my back porch and to recap  your assholedness...ya that's right...ass-hole-ed-ness...This is going to be long folks, so grab a cocktail and hunker down....I promise not to leave out any juicy details...ground)...K ...so my daughter  totally gets dressed in a dress and comes out in the kitchen tonight...I'm like oh yeah! 8 and in a dress, let's go to dinner. We went to The Parlor..no parking...and passed Tommy 's on the way there..mental note..they are NOW open...so went back..she was said, "No Mommy..please Tarbell's"..cuz. she loves Jason there...I said, " They are in the neighborhood..let's just try it out." Ok, Tommy V's...so we walk in and the "Not old enough to lick a postage stamp hostess says to us, "Um, I'm sorry there are only 6 tops available so we can't seat you...or you can sit in the banquet room by yourself...really? "really? " I say to her.."there are 6 tables open and 5 at the bar..can we sit at the bar?" she goes and asks  the bartender.."No, sorry...I am like, "really, we live in Arizona. They allow guns in bars" she was like, really??? I am like ..this is so not worth it...(sorry I am sounding like valley girl right now..but like duh?) Any who, I stood my ground and she finally sat us at a "6 top" that was obviously on hold for Casper and his friends.  So, the waitress finally saunters over ...We order Calamari ...SUCKED! It was a soggy ass mess...then Meat Pizza and Bolognese Pasta...no options on Pizza  and they served the veal bolognese( I had high hopes, I know..but I did)...with pre bought corkscrew noodles to an adult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only corkscrew I like is in my wine.,Seriously ,VEAL ON CORKSCREW...am I missing something? Apparently..I will never miss this place another second of one moment of one ioda of one day in my life..Sorry tangit...so then, apparently the wait staff had not seen each other since high school...because they concregated more on "catch up"than actually waiting tables...when she finally did come over she stacked our dishes and left them there, then took 15 min to get the check back....15!!!! THEY WEREN'T EVEN BUSY! So, then on the way out  the"not old enough to lick a postage stamp hostess" is actually chewing her nails as we are leaving and does not EVEN bother to take her fingers out of her mouth as she says..."thanks for coming" ..really? really right now? no one has said that with less enthusiasum than when my best gay friend and I decided to have sex just to see what it woudl be like...If you have a perfectly ironed golf shirt and like Tomaso's  and have a case of Scotch in your trunk and have to take your wife to dinner, drop her drunk ass off at home, then get your plasta gal on speed dial then this place is for you. If not, don't bother..EVER!!!!! but do go to Tarbell's ...still classic, divine and NOT TOMMY V"S!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fred, Ethel, Lucyyyyyyyyyyy! I like-a dis place! I have been here 4 times..can't believe I haven't yelped it yet..but I have been taking a writing hiatis because my 4000 texts and 2800 talk minutes seem to be eating up all my time. Speaking of eating up...you've got to come eat up the grilled asparagus with melted Parmesan and balsamic drizzle...frizzle de dizzle..me good!! I have to get it every time! The bartender is awesome here!! The drinks are divine, the peeps hanging around to take care of your every whim...who could ask for anything more? Oh wait..I can! And they delivered..free valet outside the south entrance with an outside elevator just for Fred's! Oh no they di-'nt? Oh ya..they did! And on top of all that, Tony down in the shoe department has no problem pouring you a glass of vino and putting dessert on your feet! Yes I did, and it was well worth it! Love you Fred!

Robert is an amazingly peaceful zen master massage, cupping cranial, reiki therapist. I sought someone, anyone out who could help me with my chronic fatigue and lethargy last spring. After much research and the glowing reviews on his website, I made an appointment which turned into 5-6 consecutive appointments. I needed enough energy to go on a 5 day trip with 30 10 year olds last spring. I kind of made up my own special therapy with Robert. He is a massage cupping champion! I combined deep cupping massage with Rose or Spearmint Oil, followed by cranial and reiki alignment. My 1st session my back was literally violet black..stagnant blood, definitely a little sore..but in such a good way. After so long, I started feeling SOOOO much better. He gave me the gift of his peaceful energizing spirit. For that I am forever grateful. After 6 sessions, my back barely drew up any color, I felt peaceful and much more clear. He put the zen in me..so much so that I literally enjoyed every minute of my trip with 30 screamin meamies and came home with energy to spare. I just started thinking about Robert and thought, why haven't I yelped him. Robert is truly gifted. It's like he has magic hands that float delicately above your body at times, then you feel something move inside and you know it's going to be better. If you have never had cupping before, or if you have Robert is the Master Fire Ball Wizard!!  Ask for the Treacy Special...you can thank me later!

When they see my car...oh jeez...here she is again...how much vodka do her friends drink in a week???? This is the only place I can find Jewel of Russia Ultra...it is about $80 a bottle..seriously ..the best $80 you could ever..ever spend! The bottles are all hand painted in porcelain(?)..It makes a stunning gift! But they also sell the regular Jewel of Russia ..which I buy for every day..it's about $40 a bottle..AJ's carries this as well...the only problem is Tarbell's is the only place I know of where you can get a drink with it.  Belevdere is my 3rd option...Oh can you tell I only drink Vodka..darling..

I only have time for a short review...YUM-2-THE-EEE!!!!! Seriously I am a mussel fanatic and Eric delivers! I need to do a separate review just for the mussels. The white truffle pizza with wilt your socks off as you become Butta on the floor. However, the cheese sauce for his stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto was orgasmic. I started eating it with a spoon like soup, then grabbed the damn little serving bowl and drank it, like it was the last drop of water on earth, then I think I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand all while moaning, "Make this into a soup, paaaleeeaazzzzzzzze!" Thank God my daughter wasn't with, embarrassing. However, she got lamb chops delivered and after devouring them says, "Those will change your life." Love this little spot so much! Thanks Eric and staff. It was like meeting old cozy friends again.

A  little slice of heaven in my hood that I wanted to savor and marinate and hold secret..but realize Justin and his crew should get every 5 star they deserve.. Even if it means I no longer get a seat. The whole crew here is awesome and warm at it's best.  The mussels are devine. As I have been ordering them weekly for over a year. Big, big bowl sweet, savory and oh so delicious! You can ask for the bread to be gluten fre to ensure you get a gluten free meal as specified on the menu. There are many gluten free and vegetarian options on the menu and always great specials. He makes a mean pan roasted chicken and the ever popular bacon smore dessert.  A MUST!! My 11 year old daughter would live here if she could! Comfort food at it's best in a good old school urban energetic yet laid back family dining. Beckett's Table is ALWAYS in my top 3 weekly dining spots.

Simply delicious! Super fresh! Clean! Nice space! Great music selection! Well stocked little Bar! The best part, aside from the really delicious food, was Pia, our server. Here 1 month from Thailand.. Excellent service!!! She only works Fri, Sat Sun. My daughter fell in love with her and the food!! Great new place to add to our weekly line-up! I used a lot of exclamations because it made us feel happy! And we could all use a little more happy in our lives! Thanks SaBai! See you soon!

I try and eat here at least once every couple of weeks. I love the melon soupm which I add the jasmine rice in it. The Beef salad is awesome! My daughter LOVES to eat here. The food is very fresh. The service is great! I love that it takes a little longer because I know they are cooking from scratch. It was a bit toasty one night, but I asked for the fan to be turned up. No problem. I love the books at the tables and the quaint and cozy feel. I just read "Jess W. " review about cash only, but I have always paid with a debit or other card. Is this new? I alwasy eat there at night though. Maybe call ahead and see, if they swiched to cash only, it's worth the extra 2 minute atm stop to eat here!

For my daughter! BOSA ROCKS!!!  She can scarf 2 doz. doughnut holes in less than 1/2 a block from leaving their window! " liitle puffs of heaven" she calls them. I got smart and order and pay for them the night before a sleep over. Usually order 5-6 doz. and that's only 3 girls. I grab them before they wake up...OMG! I am Mommy of the year when they wander into the kitchen! Why should the sugar high end at 4 in the am,that they think I did not know about! Yee Haaaaah! I know! I Know! But, you are only a kid once. I am totally organic, gluten-free. You just gotta BOSA!  Kind like op -op- op nam- gangnam style!  Bosa will rock your morning socks off!

ROCK STARS!!!!  My phone just went blank, no white screen. Nada! I took it to ATT (have insurance) they told me to take it to Apple. I went to Apple, got the dirty hair skinny jean jerk who thought his upcoming birthday was more important than helping me, even though I had an appointment. He took my phone in the back.  40 min. later he brings out a new phone says here you go. Uhm..NO!!! I want  my phone the ONE I paid for with all of MY information stored on it. He said, "Good Luck Honey, you'll be back", as he flipped his nasty wig top and sauntered off...Really?! Uhm NO, trust me I won't. I checked google found these ROCK STARS! and the rest is divine intervention history. 4G fixed! All info saved! They now have my PC that has been in update mode since July and my old 3G with a smashed screen. Super efficient, Super nice receptionist. Highly skilled personnel! I can't thank you enough Mac Masters!!

Elegant sushi art at it's finest!. A class unto itself. My FAVE sexy cozy spot.  The fact that they have amazing, and I mean amazing orgasmic food and ambience in this strip mall is crazy! I close my eyes with every bite and melt into my seat. I am so happy I found this little slice of refined sushi heaven. Top notch, top class. Worth finding and worth every single benjamin.

It's a dive bar redone in wood. Big deal. Cute, maybe. The service is horrible. The alcohol selection stinks. Bartenders with major attitude. God forbid they have to walk out from behind the bar before a server gets there. I guess we weren't drunk enough to see the 5 glowing stars everyone else does. Blah...

I have gotten take-out from here twice in the past week . It's a little hidden gem just off 71st and Shea ( on Becker) tucked between Handle Bar J's and a strip mall. Their sign is barely visable under a great Misquite Tree and only signed from the east side view. Sounds complicated, but once you find it, you will be dancing in the streets!  The pizza cooks in 90 seconds ( literally), so if you want to take dinner a little slower, don't order it right away. The appetizers I have tried while ordering my take-out have been great! My family and friends CRAVE this pizza! I live in central Phx, but it is so worth the drive. If you get take out, trust me and order 2 pies. I  got two bites of the last pizza I brought home. They see the box enter the door, grab and run!! It's comical and scarry! I try and live Gluten-Free and have yet to ask them if they can come up with a crust for GF pizza, but weirdly enough I don't feel bad after eating it and didn't gain any weight. My friend said the same thing of her experience with their pizza. That made us both happy! I rarely eat pizza, because I have never found one I like in the valley. Now I found one I LOVE!!!. Il Bosco is  quaint &  hip with super simple deliciously yummy food. Ciao!

I appreciate when I have been to a place and  they # 1 remember my name, #2 thank me for my business and #3 give me the same excellent product every single time I come in. As I told them, my daughter may rip into the box the second I picked her up, 30 minutes away and she did! I called her and said I had a surprise! She got in the car, saw a science experiment kit...long face.then her nose ever so slightly caught a quaffed of what? what? " Is that Il Bosco?!!!" in the highest pitch thrill. "Pull  over! Pull Over!!" I said, " Roll down your window" in my best Corleone voice,"Pizza Delivery is yours"..so as we sat along Osborn and devoured pizza, her inside, me out. A sense of complete sublime bliss was the picture I foretold. As I said before, I am not a pizza girl, but there is something about the encumbrance of Il Bosco pizza that I needed tonight. They had no idea that I would be sitting and watching and weeping to a cancer benefit on TV, because of family and friends and Taylor and Ronan. Yet I picked their pizza to comfort me. The Biaggati)?) Salty and Sweet and different  and wonderfully complex yet  simple in crust. l  know this was without doubt the exact comfort I needed and will yearn for  because of all of  the above mentioned reasons.  It heats up perfectly at home, and although you may not have the same charm as being at Il Bosco in person, you have the same love ensconsed in their box of pizza pie.

The worst pile of mush in crappy containers I have ever had. The place was filthy. The food is actually inedible. I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Then again they eat raw vegan and organic. This place is a hole. An hour of my life I'll never get back and $40 for two bowls and two juices of all which got thrown away. GG is a JOKE on anything healthy or nutritionally orientated. It's really too bad that people are so desperate for "healthy" food or no longer have taste buds from eating so unhealthy that they really think these boxes of crap are good. You know, my bad though. After seeing how filthy it was, no greeting upon entering, being handed off to the sweaty guy who couldn't even look us in the eye to take our order, because I think he was too busy worried about the sweat about to roll down his face, GROSS! I should have walked out. The only thing they have going is location, I think. I live in Cenpho and generally can't stand anything in NS, because as I have found out it always like this. Pseudo trendy, subpar food and crap service to wannabe's. Oh, they hit the nail on the head. Here's my suggestion for anyone wanting to try this place, Grab onto your Greens, shove them as far in your wallet or pocket  as possible and save your hard earned money for truly great healthy food. Take a drive to the SE part of the city and see how Pomegranate Café gets it right.

There are some places you just want to keep to yourself. Tarbell's Tavern is my hot bath, favorite jammies, great glass of wine, crawl into bed, fire burning, book reading, tummy super happy deliciously full ~ kind of place. I'm not even going to discuss the amazing plates because it's Mark Tarbell. Upscale pub. Excellent music, perfect acoustics for the music and hearing the person next to or across from you. The bartender turned me on to a delicious way to finish off my oysters. It' s hard to stump me on the oyster front. Yet, he did. I never would have picked that liquid accompaniment. I could tell you. But, they can deliver it. I am so lucky this is in my neighborhood. But, I would drive, bike, or pogo there anytime if it's wasn't. Thank you Mark for this amazing little gem and the attention to such fine details. except the pens...wood grain would be amazing with the block. Just saying...Cheers!
