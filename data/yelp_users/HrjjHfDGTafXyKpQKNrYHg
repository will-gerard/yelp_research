Let me start by saying we've been here befor and had good experiences but this was the Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, I was told the wait was 35 to 40 min... an hour later I asked when we would be sat and I was greeted with three girls and nothing but attitude. When I asked why people who came in after us were served I was told that they were either "friends" or investors.  20 min later I approached them again noticing that nearly everyone that came in after me had been sat. I was told that they called us which was a blatant lie because where we were waiting the intercom was so loud it made my granddaughter scared every time they used it. Come to find out when we asked the first time how long the wait would be they put a mark next to our name which made them believe they called our name when they had not...genius!  When they figured out their mistake all I teceived was attitude and NO apology. So we asked to see the manager, it's been an hour and a half by now...we have no choice but to wait because this is the only place near by. We finally get a table and the waitress is a doll, she is great! They send up the manager...lo and behold it's the bartender NOT the manager...This place is one giant joke. The food was dry and the employees horrible!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for breakfast. They are always busy but I've never had to wait. The selection for breakfast is yummy!  I'd suggest this place to everyone!

Horrible experience, we got there and nobody had any idea what they were doing. After sitting for what seemed forever we got a seat, the waiter came promptly took our drink order and came back fairly quick, so far so good, right.  After asking for sweet and low for my tea we didn't see the waiter again for close to 10 minutes. When he returned to take our order I still had no sweet and low, asking again giving him the benefit of the doubt I didn't receive any until I asked the manager. Our food was delivered by another server and it came out cold and hard, we all ran out of drinks with no refills and didn't see our waiter again until it was time to pay. Our bill totaled $33.44 I gave the waiter a gift card with $25 on it and my bank card to put the rest on. He came back with a receipt showing $8.44, thinking it was right I tipped him $8.56 (much more than he deserved) after going to the movies I checked my bank account online the waiter charged the entire bill on my card and pocketed the gift card. Horrible service, gross food and a thief. Guess I now have to fight a battle tomorrow.
