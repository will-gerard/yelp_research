Heard the great news that Nandos serves breakfast , so I had to try it out  Went in on a Saturday and ordered one of the breakfast burritos with the potato and it was excellent. I recommend giving there breakfast a try. I was not disappointed  And the bloody marry was great and at a great price

Moved from Washington to Arizona searched all around for good Thai food  Stumbled across this place and now I'm hooked  Great spices and great food

Chef Michael cooked for me and some friends at a recent dinner party, and I could not have enjoyed it more! His food is delicious, and he's incredibly professional and personal! I would highly recommend Chef Michael Denton! Two to ten thumbs up

The wife and I wanted to try this place for the first time. So we planned on eating there. We walked in  and the host greeted us nicely and showed us our seats, but once we where sat down we ended up waiting 15-20 just for anyone to ask us for our drink order. I was about to leave until the waitress came up ( which she was super nice but boring) so she takes our order . We order our food I got the brazen chicken strip sandwich which was "good" my wife ordered the ceaser salad that was horrible over loaded with Realy runny dressing she couldn't even it , it mostly tasted of mayo. So that how my exsperence went :(
