I know, five stars for Great Clips? But it was six o'clock on a Wednesday, they were pretty busy but I was in a chair in ten minutes. I was way past due for a cut, there was a lot of work to do but I was out in 15 minutes. The cut I received rivals $60 cuts elsewhere, just with a fairly strong sense of urgency. I had a coupon for $7.99 - don't judge, I make up for it in the tip. It's  a franchise, the stylist did the work, why should someone else get the money? All things considered, five stars is about right.

This location is fantastic. I normally go to the location just north on the 101 and FLW near work, also fantastic. But at 5:30, I was driving home with the TPMS light on for the third day and decided to get off the freeway and have a free pressure check done. One of the tires had 10 psi and they offered to patch it when they had a waiting room full of people and were closing in twenty minutes. 10 psi is pretty scary to be going 80 and I felt pretty stupid for driving on it but you really can't tell with the tires on most cars now. Anyway, that's stellar service, how many places would get you in with that time window?

You guys are seriously amazing. Everything I order, no matter when I order it, is always consistently awesome. I know that's a lot to say about delivery pizza but it's true, they really do pizza here well.

Kimberly D could not be more right about the attitude of the person who takes phone orders. I'm not sure it's the owner but he sounds like the same rude, condescending prick every time I order. I've walked in to order as well and the service is usually awesome when I order in person. TJs food is always delicious whether picked up or delivered but I always second guess ordering from them if I plan to call it in for pickup or delivery. I'm aware customer service is a dying art but come on... No one deserves that kind of rude attitude. Keep driving away customers TJs. Don't be surprised if the calls stop coming in.

They're great. One hour from calling to schedule to a complete repair. Thirteen years in Arizona and I've never need HVAC assistance before now. This place was a shot in the dark. Thank you Yelp! For the first time since moving in two months ago, its cool in my bedroom. I'm a very happy customer.
