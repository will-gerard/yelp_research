Small shack that reminds me of an old photo-mat. Only a small outside patio and a drive thru. This was my first time here. I ordered a carne asada, and a carnitas tacos. Carnitas was outstanding! Carne asada was very tender although could have used a little more flavor. Overall I like this place and next visit to Casa Grande I'll be back.

Service sucks! Service sucks! I would like to order a bottle beer!. . . They don't have time for that. .   This place is fantastic if they had a server or bartender that cared about something other than drama!. . . Did I mention that service sucks! . . Well it does!

Only four cars in front of mine and thirty minutes later they still have not wiped my car down.

Came here prior to a football game. I expected expensive food and drink, but come on, $14 for a burger, and $7 for a domestic beer. I'll wait and buy a $8 burger in the stadium. . .

TERRIBLE SERVICE. Great happy hour prices, and the food is less than mediocre. Waitresses are not friendly and you wait, and wait, and wait for her to come back and ask if you'd like another drink. And then you wait, and wait, and wait for your drink. This is from three separate visits, and friends say the same. Atmosphere is great, patio is very cool. Did I mention how much the service SUCKS?

First off, this is a bar! If you're looking for a restaurant to take the kiddies or have a romantic dinner then this is not the right place! Better than average "bar food" with HUGE  portions! Extremely cold beer! The entire staff moves fast to keep your drink full. Pool tables, darts, corn hole, ntn, nice patio with coolers, decent amount of tv's. Live music. . . What else do you need from a bar?

Jessica took great care of Chumlee! They got me in on short notice, didn't take long. They have a waiting area of you choose to wait there. I'll be back!

Great bar!  Much better than it was previously. Nicest/largest smokers area I have seen. Play corn hole. Great tv's. Great bartenders. I haven't tried the food, but everyone says it's good.

The food is above average bar food. (Try the rattler bites).  Some of their nightly special's are very good.  Some of the staff is incredible! Great tv's! Nice patio for the smokers.
