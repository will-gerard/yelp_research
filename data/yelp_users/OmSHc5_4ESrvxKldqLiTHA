Really wonderful space.  I love the myriad options...I'll have a brewed, tropical flavored ice tea, no wait, I'll have a glass of pinot noir, no wait I'll have a chai latte with soy milk...um, wait, how's the lemonade? This was me at the counter trying to order (ok, not really- but it's what was going on in my head).  Lux is the perfect place to get some work done while still interacting with the 3 dimensional people.  When I'm reading some clinical texts and I'm afraid I'm going to slip into a coma, I go to Lux.  Somehow reading boring things in the presence of fascinating people is substantially more doable.

This is the second oil change I've gotten from this place. Friendly staff and prompt service brought me back. I like that the guys here seem trustworthy and that they aren't trying to sell me a bunch of stuff I don't need. Mike, one of the technicians is super friends and helpful! I'll be back for sure!

Maybe it's because we only ordered from the Happy Hour menu, but all of the sushi rolls had some tempura (read, FRIED) component to them, and the salmon and shrimp crunch rolls had some white, weird, sperm looking sauce all over them.  Also, I've eaten A LOT of tempura...I mean A LOT; I have never had a tempura carrot, and if they are going to fry a carrot could they cut it down to be less than 3 inches thick? It was inedible.  The service was ok, but honestly I don't understand all of the high reviews for this place.  It was overpriced and just not very good.  The reason I'm giving them two stars instead of 1 is the happy hour menu had pretty good beer prices.

Pretty big menu, cheap prices and a super fresh salsa bar make this place awesome!   Not really much about this place is that interesting, except that you order at the walk up bar, they call your name and you pick up your food.  When picking up our order the guy at the counter told us we pay after we're done...well, some pretty lively conversation and a few beers later we promptly ran out on our tab (by accident).  After a few hours my friend realized we hadn't paid and went back to settle our tab.  TaCarbon, just a suggestion, get your payment at time of food delivery!!!!! This place is run sort of like a cafeteria - there's no reason to think you have to go back after you're done eating!  Anyway, the food was tasty! We had the lingua tacos, the pastor plato and Tecate - made for an awesome lunch! They have outdoor seating and some pretty sturdy heaters for the patio - it's a good thing because it was packed inside with a crowd that included a lot of kids~

I really like this gym - it has lots of equipment and I never have to wait for machines.  I wish they had more classes during the day - Surprise is a retirement community and I think a lot of people would attend mid-day classes.  The gym is solid and the staff seem friendly and upbeat.  The really awesome thing about Mountainside Fitness is their training staff.  My trainer is Yvette and she is AMAZING! First of all she is in impeccable shape and that is always motivating - but secondly she is tough but kind.  I usually leave feeling like I'm going pass out (in a good way).  Actually, one time I was sick and was literally going to pass out and she was compassionate and encouraging.  Great gym and awesome trainers - win win!!

Great dermatology office in Surprise.  I was able to make an appointment within a few weeks of calling; my schedule is hectic so I needed a specific date.  When I pulled up, I saw a sign that said same day appointments are available. Most dermatologists in the area book appointments months out - that's ridiculous and impossible for me.  Dr. Forrest was very attentive and was willing to discuss my concerns in depth and offer several solutions.  She was knowledgeable and willing to discuss myriad options.  The front desk staff were friendly and easy to deal with as well.

Katz & Dogs is AWESOME! I brought my senior pooch in to get his teeth cleaned, and they did an amazing job with as much care as I would have given him myself~  Dr. Katz and all of the staff are clearly animal lovers and they treated my dog with such compassion and patience that I actually felt comfortable leaving my dog in their care.  A full dental cleaning is a serious undertaking, especially for a geriatric pooch - Tom was gentle with his exam and Dr. Katz clearly answered all of my questions before admitting Potato.  This place is truly amazing and the staff is friendly, helpful and skilled = AWESOME!

I love how Potato (my 14 year old mixed breed pup) is treated here!!! Dr. DeKing and all of the staff are amazing! I have brought Potato here when he has an upset stomach, for his separation anxiety & for general care and he is always treated like he's the only animal in the world!  Recently when drug manufacturers discontinued a medication Potato is on, I had to call Surprise Animal Hospital numerous times and they never sounded annoyed, or frustrated that I was being so needy.  In short, they were compassionate and really tried to find the best option for Potato.  I know that I think Potato is the most important pooch in the world, but Surprise Animal Hospital treats each animal and human customer as though they are the most important thing in the world.  They are open Saturdays too!

Great service & super cute furniture! Yay! I searched for hours through various swatches as their sofas come in SO many fabric options! While I was contemplating my furniture plans I met an interior designer who told me that this place has great quality furniture for awesome prices & that she uses them for a lot of her upscale remodels- um, yeah that's awesome!  This is a total find & well worth the drive!

Anyone that has ever considered getting a Brazillan wax understands how potentially uncomfortable and completely awkward the whole experience can be.  Stripping from the waist down in front of a stranger, and then having your hair ripped out from the root typically sucks.  However, Kelli makes a potentially excruciating event almost pleasant! I've had a lot of Brazillians and have been caused waaaay more pain.  I don't know if it's because she uses the best wax or if it's her expert technique - but whatever it is I will only go to someone else for a Brazillian if Kelli retires!!!   Her studio is private, clean and very calming.  Kelli herself is personable and funny - a nice, down to earth person that really knows what she's doing.  I know some people decide where to get waxed by price or proximity - but I want skill and speed.  Kelli is awesome and I'm SO glad I found her!

Worst service ever. I changed my PCP over to this clinic because they are very close to my house and they always seemed empty so I figured I could get an appointment quickly. I was able to get an appointment right away (same day I called actually) with a physician's assistant. While the PA was fine, he seemed to be competent- the administrative staff were complete morons. Giggling, loud talking, complaining about their job- all while customers sat in the lobby. After being sent to get X-Rays, I was surprised to never get a follow up call. Well, more than a month after I took the x-ray's I get a letter in the mail that they have been unable to reach me via phone. I call them, I wait on hold for OVER 30 minutes and then speak to another genius (sarcasm) who has great difficulty updating my phone number in the system. This place may be close, but their ineptitude doesn't make going here convenient. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Absolutely terrible.

Darryl Archer, the owner of Darryl's plumbing is an honest and wonderful man.  My house in Sun City Grand has had myriad plumbing problems, the dishwasher wasn't working, the kitchen sink was stopped up, the garbage disposal wasn't working and the sprinklers some how sprung an underground leak - Darryl has fixed every one of the issues quickly, and has been so kind in the process.  My sister and I inherited this house from my father and we conducted a lot of business with Darryl over the phone.  He has helped us out enormously and has never tried to take advantage of the difficult situation.  He has a great way with pets (my 8 pound dog tried to attack him), and with people alike.  It's wonderful to have a plumber to call that can be trusted.  If you're looking for a plumber you can't go wrong with Darryl's plumbing! His rates are reasonable and he does amazing work! He even referred us to a landscaper that also did a wonderful job at reasonable prices!!!  We love Darryl and are so glad that we found him!

Absolutely gorgeous interior with a Southern plantation feel. I love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters. Seafood options, ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat (not so big around that a normal sized person can't bite into it), and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light.  That being said- anyone who goes to The Henry and doesn't get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat. I'm actually dreaming about them as I write this.  For the folks who prefer to drink their calories, no shortage of options here either. Great cocktail menu, wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines. This place is the perfect happy hour spot. BONUS- the interior is acoustically pleasing as well. No straining to hear the person across the table from you. It was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us. NICE!

OMG! Is it possible for my eyelashes to hurt??! Jeez!!!! This place provides an awesome workout!! The best part is that you can go at your own pace and not get judged by the super buff gym rat next to you. The teachers are super patient and really helped guide my form. I'm a kickboxing newbie- but I think I'm quickly going to become an addict. It's impossible not to feel proud after completing this class. Go me!  The staff is super friendly, helpful and knowledgable. Just what you want when trying something new and kind of scary!
