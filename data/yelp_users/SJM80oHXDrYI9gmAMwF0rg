I come thru the drive thru a few times a week and must say..these are the nicest employees..Richard and Hassan have worked there FOREVER.. and are friendly,knowledgable and get people thru the drive thru quickly. For the room they have to do business..they do a great job..Richard always makes a point to ask me how I'm doing and has a sincere smile on his face...

Great value and super good food. Felt a bit rushed during dinner , and was surprised since there was only one other family dining in. Will definitely come back.

IF you are a wanna be gansta, like rude service and poor quality, over priced food......MAN, You are in for a treat. EVEN the security guards have bad attitudes!

went there last night..Terrible customer service, employees yelling and carrying on. Got my order wrong then acted like I was bothering them to correct it. Guess adding lettuce to an Enchirito is a task. Horrible infestation of flies in dining room.

Why are you closed and no note on the door? Tried to call and it says you are having phone problems?!
