Outstanding salsa!  They bring the pico and salsa separate so you can mix your own to taste and they are generous with both...   Green chili beef nachos.... Mmmmmmmm, so yummy!  So huge!   Negro Modelo... Perfectly cold!  Next time we find ourselves at The Old Pueblo Cafe, this is what we will order and nothing more because this was the highlight... Downhill fast after our appetizers...   Momma had Sonoran Enchiladas and thought they had no real flavor or heat... She tried adding some salsa but it did not help, they were just too bland to be helped.  The Main Man had Mexican Flag Enchiladas and found cold spots within the warmth... What the heck?  His refried beans had whole, hard, crunchy beans among what looked like old, crusty mush... What the heck?  Overall, he says his plate was bland as well.  I had a fish taco and relleno with rice and beans.  The tortilla for the taco arrived already saturated with moisture and falling apart... I discarded it and was left with my hunk of cod, cabbage, lettuce, and sauce... Still tasty but more of a salad than a taco.  The relleno gave me fond memories of La Union Station; if you've been you know what I'm talking about, if you have not... Sorry... My beans had appropriate consistency and I liked the rice just fine for the few bites I took.  The service was efficient and pleasant for an extremely busy Sunday afternoon during the big art event but when most of the main dishes are sub-par, I can't go higher than 2 stars... Stick with the salsa, nachos, and beer and have a 4-5 star experience!

Okay, I didn't dine in... I was the 1:30 am takeout queen on my excursion to La Flor.  The MAN ordered two sets of taquitos and a la carte chicken enchiladas.  I had fish tacos and upped my order to a combo with rice and beans.  One set of taquitos went right into the fridge for chow the following day. One set got devoured and the MAN reported them to be outstanding.  I, admittedly, gave the tortillas from my fish tacos to the pups, but the fish was perfectly cooked and mixed very well with the cabbage, sauce, and red chili copiously supplied by the very friendly overnight counter personnel.  The chicken enchiladas were AMAZING and really made the local Mexican restaurants look like junk food in comparison.  The reheated taquitos 24 hrs later were very good... Not sure how they reheated so dang well (surely a testament to the initial cooking) and with no grease stain on the paper towels...   The rice and beans were cleaned up in minutes and were exactly what one wants from rice and beans... Beans that stick to the fork (no spoon necessary) but are still soft enough that chewing isn't required and rice that separates (not sticky at all) and is still firm.  Perfectly yummy!!!!!  Visit Flor instead of the silly Sonic sitting in the parking lot in front of it, they are open 24/7, you won't be disappointed!

One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!

Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.  Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!  Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me.

I can certainly see why Urban Cookies, aka Ollie Cakes, won cupcake wars... WOW!  Good thing I don't live close, I'd be an absolute addict!  The brown velvet is awesome and the lemon is unbelievable!  I don't know what it was called, but it was the cake they made from the first round of Cupcake Wars with the odd ingredients... Admittedly, I was scared because it was a series of things that did not go together and certainly did not seem destined for cupcake fame... But oh my, was it good!  Savory without being gross and sweet without being cloying... Give it a try...  Tried these on the same day I tried a Tammie Coe a couple months ago and the TC cakes, service, price, taste, texture, and presentation did not hold a candle to my Ollie Cakes!    My only downgrade was for the cookies... They were grainy, bland, and disappointing... Maybe the cupcakes are just so damn good that nothing else can compete...

Momma has taken her pups here for play for years and loves The Puppy Palace.  We just learned they offer kennel services and were looking for a new vacation home for the pups after our favorite kennel suffered a distinct change in attitude/service/quality that was not for the better...  Took the fuzzy ones in for an afternoon of play to test the waters... Staff was friendly, helpful, and accommodating with our old guy and shy girl...  Shy girl hid but was not totally traumatized by the afternoon and the old guy had a ball... Like needed his anti-inflamatories for two days after because he had so much fun romping with the other day care dogs!  More play dates to come and they have earned our next vacation reservation... We will update as things progress but so far, so good!

Kudos to Macayo's! New menu, clean flavors, clean presentation, solid service... The main man did the build your own thing with an enchilada and a tostada and I had a chicken chimi... All very tasty! Our only complaint was with the chicken on our nachos, it was canned chicken. Not sure why when they used very tender, moist, flavorful chicken in the chimi. The nachos were very good, they would have been great with the shredded chicken. They would have been outstanding if chicken asada had been used!  But this is a HUGE turnaround for Macayo's and for the better!

Gawd!!!! It's embarrassing to give a VI five stars but this one earned each star today!    First, it was NOT packed and we got a table with no wait at 1100 on a Sunday morning.  Second, from the hostess to the manager to the cook who waved at me from the kitchen, EVERYONE was warm, friendly, polite, helpful, and dare I say, downright CHEERFUL.  Third, our server, Jennifer, was five star all the way... She was high class and high quality, WTF is she doing working at a VI?????  Oh yeah, she was making my freakin' day, that's what she's doing working at a VI!!!!  Thank you Jennifer!  So we really took note that while we thought we had the BEST WAITRESS EVER, that all the other waiters and waitresses were equally professional, cheerful, and efficient.  WOW!!!!  Again, at a VI???   I am perplexed, confused... VI was always a quick, semi-crappy meal with a tweaked out server and non-existent support personnel... But I must now confess that we will be back so see if we were delusional due to lack of sleep or if this is a whole new VI.  I haven't even talked about the food... Like the service, this was the best food we have ever had at a VI... double bacon skillet was phenomenal, fully loaded double cheeseburger was moist and flavorful... Pancakes, made the pancakes at Sear's in SF look silly, yeah, that yummy (at a dang VI!!!!!)!  We will be back, we will bring momma, looking forward to elation at the consistency or absolute disappointment... But today, five f-ing stars!!!!!

We are impressed! First visit to Amuse Bouche this afternoon. We were too early for the dinner menu but the lunch selection suited us just fine.   We gave the duck liver pâté a try as we have never had pâté presented on its own... No doubt whatsoever that this was excellent but it is clearly an acquired taste and we have not acquired it! The toasted, sliced baguette it came with, however, was fabulous and downright tasty with the simple house salad served with the pâté.  Given that Amuse Bouch is known and acclaimed for their Cabernet burger, that was our entree. It was everything described; thick, rich, moist, sweet, flavorful. The braised, candied onions with a wee bit of bacon was a wonderful contrast against the tangy cheese and bold beef. The ciabatta bun was a light, yet sturdy, vessel for the juicy burger.  The fries, oh the fries! Thank you for knowing how to make a fry that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside... Note I said crispy, not burnt, and tender, not mushy. They were fries, not a pre-cut baked potato... Yummy!  This was a meal that we will crave again, it was positively memorable, and will bring us back! Bonus, they asked about every aspect of our meal and upon learning we did not have the taste for pâté, removed it from our bill... This is over-the-top customer service as we had ate at least 25% of it and it was our personal experiment (as in not their problem we didn't fall in love with it).  They lost a star due to the very small tables and a more eat-in kitchen ambiance than boutique bistro (which is what the name, menu, and color scheme suggested). But this issue won't keep us from coming back.

We gave Big Buddha a try when they first opened years ago. We were really unimpressed... But we recently decided to give them another go since most other Asian restaurants in Surprise are chains and, for the most part, nasty (I have to exempt Fresh Wasabi and SK as they are both great). Our minds have been changed, BB is really good food!  We have been a few times and everything has been very good! Favorites are the chow fun, house fried rice, happy family, and garlic chicken... For a very healthy twist, try the snow white chicken and skip the rice. Best egg rolls anywhere!

Salty's has a party reputation.  I had not ever heard a word about their food so I was nervous to give them a try, even with my Groupon...  They were good, really good!  We tried the nachos with chicken and had chipotle burritos.  The nachos filled us completely and we actually boxed and took our burritos home.  The Main Man ate his burro later in the day and thought it was tasty, he had no complaints even with the reheating.  I ate mine the next day and thought it was absolutely yummy!  So yummy that I wished for another one to eat the next day, and the next day...  Thank you to Groupon for giving us a reason and opportunity to try Salty's and thank you to Salty's for being a solidly tasty choice.  We don't go over by the mall often but when we do, Salty's will be a food stop!

Yummy... Very yummy. Portions are more than adequate. This was great because I had leftovers for the next day. We felt the pricing was a bit high for eating out of plastic baskets with parchment paper liners...   But when comparing it to the other two dominant BBQ joints out west, Dillon's (which is not to our flavor liking, way overpriced, paltry portioning, and sides that are memorable for blandness) and Famous Dave's (which has great sauces, but lacking in meat quality at times, with sides that are ok but not memorable) Shane's is our newest favorite. It bumps Dave's to a distinct second because the meat was absolutely tender and stands on its own without drowning in sauce and the sides (fries, sweet potato fries, and slaw) are better all around!  Regrettably, they are not close enough to home to simply 'swing by' for a  take out order!

We did not make the trek to the east side with The Dhaba on our minds... But as we drove past it to our intended destination, I said "look honey, that's Dhaba, it gets great reviews and has been written up in Phoenix Magazine."  The Main Man replied, "its Indian, right? We like Indian, that naan bread, mmmmmm."  So we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give The Dhaba a go.  There was NO wait even though we had no reservation.  The hostess/waitress/manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders, lamb dishes for both of us.  We were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand-made, fresh food was well worth it!  MM got the basmati rice and I opted, reluctantly as I steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies, for the brown rice.  Both were FABULOUS with the moist, tender lamb.  Both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was FINALLY noticeable... Most Indian food in the Valley honestly lacks heat, kick, and flavor... These dishes delivered in all three.  What I did not notice until it was time for the 'go' box is that the brown rice has the most elegant, aromatic scent.  I may not actually eat it, but I will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it!   All in all, we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation, the food was awesome, the service pleasantly solid.  We are just sad The Dhaba is way across town...

Can't say enough about the very tasty stuffed croissant selection, the scones, and the customer service! They allow you to take your time browsing and selecting and happily answer all questions as of the prior customer didn't just ask the same things.  The scones are large, enough to cut into three servings, fluffy, and not overly sweet. Take your pick between dark chocolate chip and blueberry...   The croissants come unstuffed, with ham & Swiss, or turkey & cheddar most days... They are light, flaky but not messy, buttery heaven.  The Main Man reports the donuts to be exceptional with homemade flavor and texture.  Best part, they open nice and early... Even on the weekends!

First visit to the Yardhouse on a non-home game Sunday...  Surprised at how much business they had at 3 in the afternoon but also encouraged by it.  This must mean the place is pretty good, right?  We started with two beers out of the 120+ they have on tap.  I had one of the Oktoberfest selections, the Beirweisen, which was light, earthy, and very tasty (especially with a squeeze of lemon).  The Main Man simply had the house Hefeweisen and reported it to be nutty, full bodied, and smooth.  We sampled some nachos (of course we did, the MM has to have nachos if they are on the menu) and they were very good, just about like we make 'em at home!  Momma had to dive in and swim around in the lobster, crab, and spinach dip... So much so that she cordoned off half the order and declared it would be placed atop her order of (Mac n Cheese)2... And really, I can't blame her, it was good shit!  You know what Momma ate for lunch and all I can say is that she gave me her rolling eyeballs and strange chewing smile that I think might be the same face she gives up during an orgasm.  So while its nice to know she enjoys the food, it's disconcerting at the same time.    MM had the burger with green chili and pepper jack and it was very, very, very good!  How can one go wrong with a whole, firm, grilled Hatch green chili sitting atop lean Angus on a fall day?  I had the Surf n Turf burger sans bun and I think I'm happy I eschewed the bun.  The asparagus is the perfect compliment to the full sized chunks of crab and lobster sitting on the Angus like a beauty queens crown!    Our server was friendly, warm, and polite.  She made sure we never wanted for anything... Thank you!  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to even ponder desert, but we will be back and their molten lava cake is firmly in my sights!

The momma wanted to give this place a try back in November, so we did. I think momma might go back but we won't... Too far to drive for the cost, freezing cold dining room, and moderate quality. I really think we would have done better at Long John Silvers.  It pains me to lob a bad review to a local joint, but when I have to peel my fish out of the overly thick, greasy breading to find a total of less than 3 oz of meat inside, for over $12, I can't give any better... And I froze half to death while doing it!

Okay, the place is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for Triple D... Except, it TASTES good.  We've been to a few Triple D joints and most have been disappointing, making me wonder how much they pay to grab Guy's attention and the publicity.  Flavors of Louisiana brings it!!!!  Flavor, taste, smell, appearance, and portion... All good.  What would make them great?  One thing... Liquor license... so I could have a beer with my fab fish!  Glad I grabbed the 'go' box because I had serious craving the next day. It reheated perfectly and I learned that the flavor was really the ingredients and not over saturation of grease.  Momma loved her Gumbo and appreciated that there were NOT huge slimy chunks of okra in it.  The main man and I had oysters, chicken, and catfish... All worthy of ordering again and again and again.  I enjoyed the tater salad but we both thought the dirty rice could have used more meat in much, much larger pieces.  As it was the meat was so minimal and small it could not be tasted even though I could see it... That, and the lack of beer, were the only down sides to our kickin' Lous-E-anna experience!

I love the Wolfhound! It is a great bar.  I think the service we got tonight was the best we have ever had... It was amazing.  Our server finally told us she has a degree in culinary arts and that she tries to provide the service she herself would want... Girl, you brought it and we appreciated it!  We all shared a plate of mussels; I still think these are the very best thing on the menu and they are, hands down, the best I have had anywhere.  The white wine sauce with leeks is divine and the meat just slides right out of the shells, I could eat them weekly!  We also had a plate of fish and chips; the fish was very good and the batter tasty but wow, the grease that soaked into the bed of fries... It made the fries inedible.  We also had a selection of the street tacos, fish and carne asada, they were fine but bland.  I realize they were only a dollar each, but for a small amount of meat, some cabbage, and pico on a tiny corn tortilla, the dollar was about .40 too much.  Cheese, cheese is a common taco topping and these needed it.  Sour cream and avocado or guacamole should have been somewhere... And let your customers decide what and how much veggie topping to put on the taco!  We were informed that there was some sort of sour cream based topping on the tacos but really couldn't taste it and I definitely couldn't see it!  If I can't see it or taste it, it wasn't there... Sorry.  These were great ladies lunch tacos... Ladies that aren't hungry.  But the Wolfhound gets the four stars because of the icy cold Stella on tap, the phenomenal mussels, and the impeccable service on this visit.  Pay this young lady more and put her in the kitchen... Her talents, while appreciated in the dining room, are wasted as I am positive she can cook based on our conversation...

Second visit to Fresh Wasabi...   Arizona Rolls, fabulous... As I previously stated, we are not sushi fans, I must amend, we were not sushi fans, we are beginning to be now... And the Arizona Roll is what brought us around!  Very fresh, firm but not sticky rice that was also very light.  The Wasabi was full of flavor but not too hot.  We do wish they had given us a little more though...  Calamari... It was ok, it was chewy, rubbery, over cooked.  The batter was really good and the sauce was tasty and this was the saving grace. Once the calamari cooled though, it was just gross...  Udon noodles, again, very hot, Momma said too hot and based on my prior experience with them, I have to agree.  The broth was fabulous, again, and the yummies in the dish were just that, yummy!  I still think it needed more meat, but it is a noodle dish...  Spicy chicken dinner combo... Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but the spices and sauce were phenomenal!!!!!!  Portion was really good and plentiful without being too much...  As with last time, for some reason I have a hard time pin-pointing, the service was lacking.  We got drink refills and it was reasonably attentive, but something was missing... At least this time there was no dissertation on bento boxes and sushi... Wish I could figure out what it was... Just off somehow...   Overall, they earned a star over last visit and we will be back, no doubt!

Good food brings you back... Being brave allows you to find the GREAT food on the menu... We are definitely fans of Fresh Wasabi!!!!  and we love, love , love their sushi (we have never even liked sushi and now we are working our way through each of their amazing rolls)!!!!  The Climax roll was complete heaven and the Monkey Brains were sinful little delights... my mouth was absolutely wow'ed by the way the textures and flavors stood out while nicely mixing and mingling with each other.  If I close my eyes right now, I can still feel and taste them as if I were still sitting in the restaurant.  Now that is GREAT FOOD!!!!!  I have to say the Main Man agreed as he gave an added tip exclusively to the creator of the fabulous sushi rolls.  We began the meal with the same waitress as last time.  As I said before, she was polite and attentive but something was missing.  I slapped my Yelp deal onto the table and all of a sudden we had the most delightful woman serving us; she told us we were the first Yelp deal customers and broke into some cordial and sincere conversation about Fresh Wasabi and our prior visits.  She was not dressed like a server so I have to guess that she sits a bit higher in the hierarchy but she was a gem and cleared up my previous issues with the service (again, always good, but lacking something warm, sincere, and interested in our business).     So now we begin our quest to try each and every roll on the menu... mmmmmmmmmm...

We have now become regulars at Fresh Wasabi and we are not ashamed!!!!  Their rolls are out of this world!  We are making our way through the list and have not found a bad one yet!  They are all most certainly naughty, but in a very GOOD way.  This week we gave the Spider Roll, Guilty Pleasure Roll, Untouchable Roll, First Love Roll, and Philly Roll a try... if you like tempura (and FW does it very well) you will absolutely love the variety of flavor and texture offered in the Untouchable and Spider Rolls.  The heftiness of those two were very nicely contrasted by the lightness and citrus in the First Love and the touch of spice and heat offered by the Guilty Pleasure.  The Philly was a solid, simple, basic roll that made for a good palate cleanser between the varied selection of tempura, spice, and citrus and probably enhanced our enjoyment of all the rolls.  We added Sake Bombs to the meal this time and thought the libation was fun!  We had Mochi Ice Cream as a small treat to close the meal... and WOW, was it good!!  Again, a fabulous contrast in temperatures, textures, and subtle flavors between the outside layer and the inside ice cream.  Why did I add the 5th star, you ask?  Because the service has met the mark... warm, friendly, welcoming, everything it should be and now more...

Treated ourselves to a late afternoon, pre-dinner crowd rush, Valentine's Day meal at Fresh Wasabi yesterday. Being a small operation, the ambiance has always been a bit austere, but we immediately noticed some new decor and wall hangings, very lovely! We also noticed that they made a distinct effort at romance for the day with fresh red roses on the tables, many of the staff wearing some red, and a fun display at the greeting station.  We were greeted warmly and happily by the owner and seated at our regular table. We tried the cherry blossom roll, baked lobster roll, and the bronze medal roll this time. All were phenomenal, but we cannot imagine ordering the baked lobster roll without the bronze medal roll at the same time, they were perfectly complimentary to one another!  We paired the cherry blossom with a couple pieces of yellow tail nigiri, very soft and tender with perfect flavor, and we were happy with the match.  As always, presentation was spot-on and the service was great! It was an unexpectedly fun Valentine's meal! Thanks!

We stayed at this Hampton while attending a wedding at Bella Giardino. The hotel was clean and quiet and the staff were exceptionally helpful and polite.  The bedding was wonderful and the room plenty big.  We were mid-building, second floor facing the back of the Walmart and experienced no freeway or Walmart noise.  We just wish the cabbie from Discount had not tried to scam us on our return trip from Bella to the hotel... Advice, use the hotel shuttles or be very specific with your directions to the cabbie!  Never had such a slimy, deceptive cabbie in any city in the world!  But this was not the hotel's fault... They loose a star for not running on-demand or late shuttles for events like this...   Otherwise, it was great!

Ok, we have ow given this 'joint' three tries and they are OUT!   First visit, about two years ago, it was decent, had potential, but slow service and the food could have been something neat but just missed the mark by being boring, bland, and overpriced.  Second visit, about the same but the service was so slow, complacent, and deplorable that we were just grateful to escape.  Final visit ever was three weeks ago.  We had the unique pleasure of watching our waitress eat Easter candy behind the counter, with her bare hands, then serve food without washing. Another customer had an issue with the food preparation, quality, and handling and requested to talk to a manager. They scraped up some guy from the back wearing dirty jeans with tattoos and hickeys on his neck to play this role... When she finished airing her concerns, the staff congregated at the counter to piss and moan about her, make fun of her, mock her, and justify their poor skills, behavior, and bad attitudes to one another.  This was simply appalling to watch!  As this drama was taking place, I see our plates hit the top shelf in the kitchen. They appear to possess our fries, kettle chips, and buns/bread. They sit, and sit, and sit while everyone in employ counts their cash, chats about anything but the business of food service, and did I mention the Easter candy eating?????? Yeah, our food server of the year is mowing through that bag as if her life depends on it and giving commentary about its tasteful wonders... Still.... Are you kidding me?????  I see our proteins land on the bread and our ever diligent server addresses them with garnish immediately after finishing her candy and not washing her hands! Awesome!!!! At least this experience will boost my immunity... Kinda like eating mud pies and drinking from the hoses when you were a kid...  So here's the issue, the burger and chicken sandwich were good, damn good as a matter of fact. We ditched the bread, it was cold and nasty, but the proteins were fabulous. Too bad the fries were cold and the kettle chips burnt to the point of no return, then both had sat so long they were soggy, chewy, just rancid.  Our server, remember her? Good, glad you did, because she could not seem to remember us... No beverage refills... No checking on us... Nothing.  We have to flag her down to ask for the check. She looks at our plates, with bread, chips, and fries still on them and asks if things were good. The main main says the bun was clearly from a bag and not even toasted and the fries cold and chewy. She declares this to be too bad and tells us she is going to give us a coupon for a free shake on our next visit.  Oh, whoa, stop there... Next visit? What was so impressive about this visit that we would spend our hard earned dollars on a next one???? No offer to make it right on the spot, that day, that moment... But a 'hey stupid, come on back for a shake so we can neglect your health and welfare and treat you like crap' coupon. We never asked for this, we responded honestly to her inquiry and got a patronizing response. And btw Easter candy queen, did we order anything dairy? What makes you think we would be appeased by a cheap dairy treat?  We paid, we left the coupon for her to use as she appeared to enjoy sugar laden treats, and departed. Never, ever, to return again. How do businesses survive in this economy with such negligent, dangerous, lax service?????

Shelly's is decent, not great, not really even good enough for me to drive out of my way to visit.  I got to sample a key lime pie bite and I was disappointed... It just didn't have the flavor and the key lime had a strange stickiness that felt more like it sat out too long than anything else.  The whipped topping was more like rubber... Not sure what was going on there.  Second sample was a lemon curd pie bite and it had the same problem as the key lime pie... Both also suffered from a crust that stuck miserably to the paper wrapper.  The lemon bars had good enough flavor but the crust, which was good as well, dominated. It was very thick and made the thin layer of lemon seem even thinner.  I enjoyed what essentially became not a lemon bar but a lemon flavored shortbread style crust... But I wished it had really been a lemon bar, switch the thickness of the lemon and the crust and it will be great.  I really wanted to try a petit four, but some local restaurant had apparently claimed them all... Shelly said they would have more later or the next day but based on my samples, I wasn't going out of my way to see...

I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who stated that Hayashi made them feel special... We didn't feel special at all... We felt like all they wanted was our money; service, quality, and atmosphere be damned!  We arrived last Monday right around 1 pm and found the place near empty save for what appeared to be a lingering ladies lunch group.  Were we seated with them even though open seats remained at the grill and the chef was still cooking???Nooooo... We got placed at the first two seats of an empty grill... Then told to wait and see if anyone would be joining us... Did I miss something? Did I sign up for the 1 pm group dining session? No, I did not, but what do they bring to my table almost 15 minutes later?  My beverage?  Nooooooo... They bring us one of the most acidic and toxic personalities I have ever been forced to dine with!!! He was pretentious, slovenly, rude, imposing, possibly wearing a toupe, and a show off; and that's the nice things I have to report...  What's worse is that he is clearly a regular and all the staff clearly knew this about him!  So why would they seat him with first time diners when there was no shortage of chefs????  Because they did not care to make us feel special...  Drinks arrive but the main man has to ask twice for sugar.  Getting refills was like begging for rain in the middle of a Phoenix summer... Futile!  After being there almost 45 minutes we are allowed to order sushi but still no grill chef in sight...  The sushi was ok... At least we didn't get sick.  Remember our obnoxious table-mate???  I agree with him on one thing... The sushi chef that day sucked... The rolls were loose and turned into piles of rice and fish with a mere touch of the chopstick... Real bummer.  The grill was marginal... Oh, yeah, the chef appeared at the hour mark... Yeah, we are feeling very special now... He swung his knife and spatula about and set some oil on fire... Oooohhhhh... Aaaaahhhhh... I'm friggin hungry!  Make. My. Food.  I end up with a pile of fried rice that, frankly, could have come from anywhere.  It lacked any seasoning at all and none was available on our table.  The veggies were fresh but like the rice, unseasoned.  Do these people watch the Food Network?  Do they not know that a failure to season is a food felony???  And finally, the meat lands on our plates... Cooked fine but, again, not seasoned in any way... So I had a good size pile of flavorless, almost texture less, non-descript food in front of me.  And by now I am so annoyed with my forced seating and table company that I want to run screaming from the place!!!!  Instead, I ask for a to-go box, because I think my dog will like the pile, and the bill, because I am now hoping to escape this hellish experience by 3 pm.  I get the box and the bill and we run for our lives... At 3:05 we are safely on our way... And NOOOOOOO we won't be back...  Hey, I guess I do agree with one of the prior reviewers, Hayashi did make me feel special... Just not in a good way.  I hope others have a better experience but for us, this was two hours of our lives we will never get back!

I was lucky enough to score a big plate of jambalaya from the Sun City Festival event on Saturday, Nov 12.  The flavors were fabulous and it had just to right amount of kick!  Can't say how delightfully surprising it was to find all the sausage and big hunks of chicken... Quality + quantity= AWESOME!!!!  Run now and find that elusive Jamburrito truck!!!

We must have been at a completely different Mike's Bistro than all the other reviewers.  We went in this afternoon around 4 for a late lunch/early dinner and while we were big fans of Mike's Greek and Italian (same Mike) before it closed a few years ago, this meal won't bring us back to the new 'bistro.'  First, 'bistro' is generous... it STILL has the same paint job it had when it was Quiznos.  It was dank, mushroom-growing dark, and quite a pained mish-mash of shabby, sad decor.  It was uncomfortably warm and smelled of vaguely of grease and body odor.  There was NOTHING 'bistro' about it.  We entered and Mike, who seemed to know english just fine when he was on the north side of Bell, now barely pushes out an understandable word.  We were handed paper menus and advised to 'sit anywhere.' After perusing the menu we decided to overlook the first impression and actually eat because, well, we were hungry and the descriptions were quite similar to the old Mike's.  We waited for service and waited for service and waited for service until we noticed Mike appeared to be taking a cat nap near the register.  We approached and he awoke and asked if we were going to eat.  Did I miss something?  We came in, we were given menus, we selected seats, we never got service... yes, we would like to eat.  We place our order and pay at the counter then reselect our seats after grabbing our own beverages.  NOT A BISTRO!  We keep a watchful eye on the counter as we now think we are at some sort of Mike's deli style joint.  But then here comes some guy who looks like he could be anyone from a customer to the A/C repair guy with a basket of what we think was supposed to be garlic bread.  I mean it was bread, it had a good crunch and was tender inside, it was yellowish on top indicating some sort of transfat substance had been placed on it, but it tasted like the same baguette I buy at Fry's except I actually use seasoning, garlic, and olive oil to make it into garlic bread!  Where is the awesome house-made butter Mike used to bring with his fresh bread????  Then our food arrives... oh the disappointment... it was painful to look at it.  The depressed decor combined with the plastic drink cups and the Goodwill-recycled-looking plates were no help to the mono-chromatic meals with no garnish.  I had the Mykonos Chicken and the Main Man had the Penne with sausage, mushrooms, cheese, and peppers.  First, the Mykonos was supposed to come with my choice of spaghetti or herb potatoes (Mike never asked when we ordered and I ended up with some Chef Boyardee looking shit on my plate).  The previously frozen chicken was nicely roasted but the tomatoes, artichokes, and sauce were very clearly canned.  And as for the feta it was supposed to be topped with (I say supposed because there was so little that I could see it but not taste it, but I had to look hard), can we, just for a minute, pretend I am paying for this meal??  Oh yeah, I already paid, at the counter!!!!   The Main Man's penne had far more flavor and was closer to the Mike's we once knew and loved.  His portion was very good for the price tag but the peppers, mushrooms, and onions were sauteed until droopy and limp and mixed with the same sad, canned tomatoes and sauce that was also feloniously assaulting my plate.  The saving grace was that the pasta was perfectly al dente and the cheese was melty and creamy and flavorful enough against the sausage to overcome the canny flavor it was tainted with.  Mike, who always used to come seek feedback during the meal never made another appearance.  We left without seeing anyone at the counter, being thanked for our $28 donation, or even told not to let the door hit us on the butt!    Our overall impression is that Mike is or was a very good cook but that he is so bad a businessman and so lazy that it has come to this... frozen, canned food reheated in a desperate attempt to hang onto the memory of better days.  All I can say is that a call to Robert Irvine and Restaurant Impossible would be the best use of some of the $28 bucks we gave him!  Visit at your own risk... but given the choice of this or Jim's Burgers and Eggs, I can actually say Jim's warrants the win.  Ouch.

Kudos!!!! Lunch on a late Saturday afternoon hit the spot!!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Rueben so I had it yet again and the MM had a burger... My Rueben did not disappoint and the MM enjoyed his chili burger (he did think the chili should have had more kick).  Ordered the fries EXTRA CRISPY WITH EXTRA SALT... And they were PERFECTLY WONDERFUL!  Not mushy or greasy... Mmmmmm.

Gave Jim's a try hoping the kinks noted by other reviewers had been worked out. We found the prices to be fair for the portion size and taste. However, we did think the burger was rather thin which caused it to be more well-done than we enjoy, but the flavor was decent. The fries were crispy on the outside and tender inside, tasty. These were the good points.  Here's the rest of the story... The service was generic, not friendly but also not cold. It was timely but I had to ask for utensils and the runner only brought me a crude, very used looking, steak knife. I then had to ask for a fork, this was my second mistake (the first is detailed below). It felt like a tedious and inefficient exercise that could be avoided by simply providing even basic plastic utensils for patrons.   The place was dirty, just dirty, dirty, dirty. We had to wipe our table down with small, dry, paper napkins from the table-top dispenser (and we picked the cleanest table we could find as all appeared quite dirty during our 3 pm visit). This bugs me because I have no idea who was there before me and what they did. And what the semi-moist smudge of viscous substance was amidst the clearly identifiable salt, pepper, catsup, and lettuce was.   There was a fork laying under the table at my feet and I made the first mistake of the meal, I kicked it out to a visible place on the open floor. When I was forced to ask for a fork, the runner noted and picked up the fork on the floor then returned (in a time frame too short for hand washing to occur) with 'a new fork.' Honestly, I doubt it was the same fork, but she just collected a fork off the floor that had been used by I don't know who, then used her same hands to bring mine. Sorry, that's just nasty... So the aforementioned steak knife sufficed as my sole utensil for the meal. I have more amenities when we camp off-grid!  We were told when we ordered that drinks had free, unlimited refills but we never saw proof of this 'deal' so take your chances with that...   I'm thinking we will have to be exceptionally hungry with absolutely no other options before we visit Jim's again... That clean thing IS a big deal!

I spent much of the winter Farmers Market season scouring the vendors in search of Lizzy... Regularly found her and her tasty morsels of evilness at the Wigwam on Sunday's... Love them all (way too much)!!!

I have to start with the caveat I grant most businesses of this nature... High staff turnover due to work, hours, wages, etc.  With this in mind and pretty much overlooked, Coldstone is deliciously awesome!!!  I've been to this location many times but the most recent visit was for a custom birthday cake for the main man. Not only did they go with my quirky request, but the decorator called to make sure, then had me come in a bit early to check it so it could be altered if I was not satisfied. Wow!!!  When I was ordering, I had a little hankering for some chocolate decadence, but true to form for me, had to be altered with some sugar free sweet cream. I got my 'like it' home pack but they had a wee bit extra and I got a little taster to walk out the door with... Very cool way to make me feel like a VIP.  The cake was exactly as dreamed and in no need of alteration and it was a pleasure to meet the decorator and share the reason for the design.  Keep it up Coldstone, the main man has declared you Stone Cold Awesome!!!!

This review is for a mid-afternoon visit on 2/27/13...  Disappointing.  This pretty much sums up our experience.  It was our first time at Tailgaters and short of something monumental happening, it will be our last.  The decor is ok, it screams pizza joint turned sports bar.  This works out and will be great come summer when trying to find a cool, dark place to get out of the heat.  The restroom was clean and interestingly, the only place where I learned of the daily specials (they were posted on the wall by the sinks) after we ordered (the waitress never said a word about them and we didn't see them anywhere in the actual bar/restaurant area).  It's all a downhill review from here so if you are looking for reasons to go, stop reading now!  We entered the place to find two people standing at the front desk and a sign reading "please seat yourself."  While the two holding the desk up appeared to acknowledge our presence, we were not greeted.  We selected a table away from the crowd in the bar because all the high tops appeared to be for larger groups and we were there to have a late lunch not get sh*t-faced on happy hour specials...  The first person to approach us might have been a manager and seemed concerned about how long we had been sitting without attention.  The main man asked about the on-tap selection as he thought a beer would taste good on the lovely spring day (remember we were primarily there for lunch not booze).  This guy didn't know the beer selection at all and went to the bar to bring us a list conjured up in some word processing program (not a formal menu).  He dumps this paper on us then disappears.  A few seconds later a different guy, clearly staff, appears and asks if we are ready to order.  We ask for menus and water and he disappears.  Within seconds we get a waitress who asks if she can get our drink order.  The main man orders a Kiltlifter and she zooms away from the table; I have to holler at her that I'd like whatever diet soda they have... This is the first time she seems to even notice I'm there.  My husband is a very handsome man but he isn't Brad Pitt!  She brings the drinks, in two separate trips, and we have to stop her from zipping off again to order.  She seems pretty put out by the fact that we want food off the menu and not just stuff from the Happy Hour app menu.  We get the HH quesadilla, the turkey bacon melt, and the bacon cheeseburger (ordering the cheeseburger should have been a moment where she could have offered the two-for-one burger special but she didn't).  The quesadilla arrives, it looks nice, the tortilla is perfectly grilled, but it's just plain cheese inside.  No seasoning, nothing special.  It is exactly as it reads in the menu and exactly what my 7 year old niece would make if I asked her for a cheese quesadilla.    Our waitress cruises the table and inquires about the quesadilla.  When the man says "it's ok" she responds by asking if he wants another beer (he's not even halfway through the original 16 oz).  When he says no, she zips away agin (I'm out of water and could use a soda refill but she apparently can't be bothered with such trivial matters).  The food arrives and our immediate reaction is WTF????  The turkey bacon melt is made with bacon bits and chopped turkey that falls right out of it the minute he picks it up.  It tastes ok but again, my niece could pull this off...  The burger is damn near slider sized and literally hiding in a bun twice the size of the meat patty.  It had two actual slices of bacon and tasted decent but again no seasoning and it was within my the abilities of my niece.  The fries weren't worth eating, pretty sure they came from a bag in the freezer.  As we are eating, the waitress speeds past and asks how things are and again, the man says "it's ok" and she responds with "want another beer?"  When he says no, she's gone again (still no refills of water or soda).  We finish and pile our dishes and the waitress comes and removes them only now asking if I'd like any refills.  When I respond no, she takes all but one plate and disappears.  And we wait.... And wait...  Has anything about our visit indicated we want to spend one more minute in this place?  Our beverages are gone and we have declined more, the food that was edible is gone and we haven't ordered more, by my count, this is when the bill usually arrives.  Nope, we have to wave her down and ask for the bill and she seems genuinely surprised that we want out... She never smiled, she never greeted us, she never refilled beverages (only asking when the man clearly hadn't had enough alcohol for the food to be better than ok and after the meal was over), she never gave us a reason to stay.    Not one thing about our visit gives us a reason to go back.  Save yourself the frustration of lackluster service by personnel that look more like biker-bar parolees than professional servers and marginal food.  Go elsewhere, anywhere, but not there.
