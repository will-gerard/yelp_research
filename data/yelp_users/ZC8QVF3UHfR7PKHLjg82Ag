I have been to Vegas twice now.  The first time we did strip and this time we stayed on Fremont Street and enjoyed experiencing the historical part of Vegas.  We decided to tour the Mob Museum and we are so glad we did.   I would recommend setting aside at least 4 hours to tour the building.  It is in an old courthouse and post office so the building itself was very cool.  There are 3 floors that you get to tour at your own pace.  There are videos to watch, photos to look at and lots of reading to do.  The museum takes you back to the very beginnings of Las Vegas and how the strip got started.  You get to see the Hollywood glamour that took place even before the mob showed up.   I would hope it's no surprise to anyone that a museum about the mob is going to have some gory photos. Having read other reviews somehow there are people that were "taken by surprise" by photos of dead mobsters.  I am not sure how that is possible.  Anyway, be aware that this isn't a museum for little kids.   It was however, a very enjoyable afternoon for us and we both thought that everything was very well done.   Don't go to Vegas without checking out the Mob Museum.

I highly recommend Dr Kleckner at Kids Rising.  I brought my ten year old son in because I believe he is having stomach aches because of stress.  He has been seen by his pediatrician who ruled out any medical problems. Dr Kleckner was wonderful with my son.  She spent a lot of time with us and really made both of us feel very comfortable.  She did an assessment and an adjustment.  She also review some supplements to give him.   He is already feeling better and I am very pleased.

I called and scheduled a moving truck over a month before my moving date.  I was moving approximately ten miles, from Goodyear to Buckeye.  I called the week before my moving date to confirm and then Az Affordable Movers called me the day before the move to confirm. They never showed up.  I waited and called and was basically given the run around.  The owner was insulting and extremely condescending.  They were suppose to show up at 8 am.  I called at 8:30 and was told that they got a late start and they were on their way.  I called at 9:00 and was told that I lived so far away and that is why they weren't there yet?????????  I own a business and do consults in private homes and I always account for drive time when I make an appointment.   This basically went on for several more hours.  I ended up having to rent a Uhaul and move my furniture myself with the help of a good friend and her 3 teenage boys on a hot July day.  One of the other frustrating issues is that the initial arrangement was for 2 men for a 4 hour minimum.  When they were running late the owner said he would send a third man but I only had to pay for 2.5 men at a 4 hour minimum.  So now the move is suppose to cost me more because they were late.  CON ARTISTS!!!!!!

I have worked as a labor and delivery RN for almost 17 years and I have worked with a lot of providers here in the Valley.  I had the pleasure of being able to work with Marinah at a birth center for about a year and a half. I feel like I learned more from working with her than I had in the 14 years I had been a labor nurse before meeting her.  She is an incredible midwife and a very initiative healer. I am a better nurse because of the time I was able to work with her.
