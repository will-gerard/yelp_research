-Medical practitioners get 4 stars.  -Whoever is accountable to the hospital's organization sadly get 0 stars. I wish I was exaggerating but I waited 4 months for an MRI on my leg injury, and 7 months for a consultation on my thumb injury.

The bathroom and environment is not very clean, which is why I was surprised a $5 basic drive-thru car wash had excellent service- guys hand dry the car- albeit I waited 10 minutes for my turn. The gas station gets 3 stars. The car wash 5 stars.

As always, excellent service and food. They just changed the menu (April 2015), so check it out if you haven't been in a while.

Subaru Miller in Salt Lake City Utah was extremely satisfying in customer service. It is surprising that Subaru in Chandler surpassed my expectations!   My experience today was a routine warranted maintenance checkup for a 2013 Subaru Impreza. The time was 90 minutes and free of charge, including a free vacuum and wash. My car is smokin clean!   Dulce has been my rep three times and I am extremely satisfied. She is thorough in her explanations and spot on her repair time estimate, to the minute.  What makes Subaru so wonderful is their environment. WIFI, TV, cookies, fruit, and quality Starbucks coffee and tea, all complimentary!   The bathrooms are modern, the floors clean, leather seats next to the TV, high individual tables for work space and moderately quiet environment.   With their expected repair shop expansion this October 2014, I can only expect better things with this Subaru branch.

Love the concept of Sandbar. But they try to sneak in smaller portions. Also, all 8 times I have been here, the bill was "accidentally" charged full price instead of Sunday-football drink prices. All 8 times. You can say, "OMG, I'm so sorry," so many times until you are no longer believable. Where is your integrity?

They know the ins-and-outs of Mac repairs. Fairly priced. Fixed my MacBook in 24 hours, after Apple Store said it's unsalvageable. Thank you guys!

They know the ins-and-outs of Mac repairs. Fairly priced. Fixed my MacBook in 24 hours, after Apple Store said it's unsalvageable. Thank you guys!  UPDATE: 3.5 months later: the same hard drive cable they fixed broke again. Although past the 90 day warranty, they fixed it without argument free of charge in 3 hours! They are AMAZINGLY loyal to customers.

This is one of the most fun, personal, intimate settings for a local play. I'm never disappointed with their performance. They have a lot of great talent and a great person leading them.

Chelsea is a stylist who understands haircuts for men, and is regularly flown throughout the US to lecture on men's hair to other stylists. At a price of $25, you are getting a steal to have Chelsea.

I love love LOVE this place! If it was only great food, this place would still get 5 stars. And it is *great* food! But there's more. The ambiance, the customer service, cleanliness, the relaxing music...everything about this place makes want to just stay here and relax. It's like my little sanctuary from the world, with the world's best desserts too.

For people who love fast food service yet upscale food. A Kneaders dessert is a treat you must try. Do your taste buds a favor.
