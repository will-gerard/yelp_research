We always have a great time at Fiddler's Dream. Not your traditional coffee house, but if you enjoy good coffee and good music, give this place a try.

The best place for a real manicure. And a fun place to spend part of your day.

This is a delightful place to find special gifts and home decor. You will love it. It's always fun to spend a little time here, and you will find the staff friendly and helpful.

Wow! The only bad thing about this bakery is now I don't have an excuse to go to New York. They really do have "New York style cheesecake". It's well worth the drive to  Sun City for this one.

I've been going to Friday's for 35 years. The food is always good as is the service. The menu has changed over the years but it never disappoints. I recommend the whiskey cake for dessert.

We've been going to Macayo's for decades and have always loved it. When we moved to Casa Grande last year we were delighted to see we had one here. But were seriously disappointed in the food. We tried it three times with same dismal results. Awful.

They don't just have great burgers.. I love the chicken sliders-mmmYum! But  what really has me yelping is the sign I read that said Pets Welcome :))) next time I go to the BluBurger, my beagle MaddyMay is going too!

I dropped off three jackets to get them ready for the cooler weather ahead. They did a good job and the jackets were ready the next day. I will definately use them again.

The best green chili burrows we've ever had- and I grew up on Mexican food. We'll definitely be back. Everything was really good. Prices not bad either.

The worst restaurant I've ever had. We waited about twenty minutes for someone to take our order and another twenty for the food to arrive (pancakes for my husband, chicken and waffles for me).  Our food was COLD. Not even warm. My husband told the cashier and she took a whole two dollars off our tab. So we ended up paying $19 for an indelible dinner. Unacceptable. Will never go there again!,,

We love this place. The food is very good with large portions, and the prices reasonable. We go there at least once a week. The taco salad is great. My husband says the tacos are very good and the cheese crisp was the best he's ever had.

We've never been disappointed here. Had the grilled chicken and strawberry salad last night and it is now my favorite. We shall come here often.

After reading the positive reviews, I thought this might be the best place for me to get a pedicure. I had a 3:00 appointment with Jess who wasn't there yet. At five after three, she still wasn't there and another employee called to see where she was. She said she would be there in five minutes. However, by 3:20 she still wasn't there. Finally left. Hope I can find another to get my nails done. But it won't be here.
