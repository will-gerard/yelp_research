This place sets a new bar for complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are a cornucopia of crispy warm blue corn, white corn, four, sweet potato, and wonton style flavors sprinkled with yummy seasonings. The freebie salsa is thick and delicious, far beyond freebie grade.  The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.  The table-side guacamole is pretty good. I think I'll ask for extra spice next time.  The outdoor seating s great...overlooking the courtyard mini waterfalls & fountain.

There are not many restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix that make me roll my eyes at the mention of their name. Ra is one of them. This is sushi for yuppies and wannabes.   Why one star at all? The sushi is slightly more interesting than what you can purchase at a grocery store. Occasionally a very friendly waiter will offer you an experimental off-the-menu roll, but this has happened to me three times, so I suspect it's a ploy similar to how Trader Joe's cashiers talk about how one of your items is their FAVORITE EVER, OMG! The drinks are decent and the business offers lots of perks (I joined their customer club as a favor to a friend...who has bad taste in sushi).  Now the bad stuff. The ambiance is cheaply over-sexed, and not in a clever burlesque way. More like a high school boy-who-fantacizes-about-Laura-Croft way. The menu tries too hard to be cute and sexy. Most of the the wait staff could easily sub at Starbucks or Applebee's. For a place that specializes in sushi, there really is no good excuse for why it's so mediocre. They don't even offer real Japanese wasabi. Half of the time I've ordered, ginger was omitted from my plate. And of course, the miso is that generic brownish stuff that you find in every Japanese-ish place that doesn't care about miso.  Every time I walk near Ra on Mill, I am reminded that I haven't had sushi in a while. Then I glance at it again, and keep walking.

The following is a live-Yelp of my first experience at Pizzeria Bianco.  Wine: Primitivo, Antico Sigillo '10 Salento, Italy (red) I'm starting out with the usual wait (45 minutes this time) at the bar next door*. I was impressed that the hostess will come over to let you know when your table is ready. The interior of the bar is warm, intimate, and very cute. I usually take my reds from California, Spain, Australia, and Argentina...this Italian is very impressive. Full-bodied, fruity (blueberry notes), very mellow tannins, consistent from the front to the back end. Thanks to the knowledgable bartender, I have a new favorite.  *The wait was more like 15 minutes. It pays to dine solo.  Pizza: Rosa, with extra fennel sausage - excellent, but not for red sauce lovers When the waiter set my pizza on the counter, my eyes got very big. It arrived piping hot and smelling delicious. It's as delicious as it smells and looks, too. The pistachios, cheese, and red onions are all melted into the wonderful crispy-tender bread. I'll ask for some olive oil...my promise to lose five pounds before New Year's Eve is now destroyed. The olive oil made a great thing even better...great for dipping the extra crust into.  Summary: Artisan bread lovers and native Italians, rejoice! Dominoes take-out palettes, Chicago pizza casserole gobblers, New York grease slice fanatics, and characters of the Jersey Shore persuasion... you might want to sit this one out.

This review is specifically for the mac-n-cheese with jalapenos and bacon. It deserves its own review.  Every time I come to Lux, I glance past the mac-n-cheese. I mean, how exciting can American restaurant mac-n-cheese be? A customer sitting next to me at the bar ordered up a bowl. It looked pretty enticing. He asked if I ever had it before. I said no, and he looks me straight in the eyes and says "you gotta do it." By the tone of his voice, the mac-n-cheese must have been an experience.  So tonight I did it, but instead it done me...oh it done me. It done me good.  Beatles fans, holla if you hear me!  I learned to make proper "macaroni pie" from a West Indian friend. You slow-cook milk, cheese, onion, a bit of flour, salt, and pepper into a delicious, aromatic cheesy creamy white soup. Then you pour al-dente elbow pasta into a baking dish. Then you pour the creamy cheese soup deliciousness over the pasta. Then you layer shredded cheese on top and bake it all together. That's how you get tender, creamy mac-n-cheese. Lux knows the deal, and they took it up a notch by throwing jalapeno peppers and bacon into the mix.  As a baked mac-n-cheese chef trained under a West Indian macaroni pie sensei, I tip my hat to you, Lux. Well done.  Edited: A tip for Ms. Andrea O. Being a pleasant customer goes a long way. Being not-a-mega-bizatch works wonders for getting good service. It works for me. You may want to try it sometime. If you suffer from perma-scowl, you could draw a smiley face on a paper bag and place it over your head.

The service and atmosphere were so bad that we left before we ordered anything. So my score is not based on the food, which I hear is delicious.   We were seated behind some obnoxiously loud lady who was over-explaining to her friend how poorly her coworker taught K-12 chemistry...and was getting almost everything wrong herself (I have a PhD in molecular genetics, so the convo was like listening to nails scraping a chalkboard). That's neither here nor there. Our bad experience was enhanced by this.  So barely being able to hear myself think, I try to order a drink. The cocktail selection stinks for a place that appears to have an open bar. Plus, the waitress wasn't very helpful at all. She offered the peach bellini and then quickly retracted when she noted that they were out of the peach ingredient. Really?  Then trying my best to speak over Loud-Talker explaining that all you needed to demonstrate "splitting atoms" is two styrofoam balls and a toothpick...nuclear fission with toothpicks...I asked the waitress if they had anything akin to an Italian soda, or maybe a soda/ seltzer with a splash of vodka and some flavor. What I figured was a simple request was impossible at Cibo.  We left as Loud-Talker proclaimed that grade school kids don't need to learn chemistry, just general science...and we wonder why AZ's 8th graders rank #45 in the nation in STEM topics.  All in all, our waitress was aloof from the moment we sat down. She was either spaced out or just had no people skills. Having the atmosphere ruined by Ms. Loud-Talker was our own bad luck, but I still give this place one star for the poor service.  We left and went to The Vig next door. That place rocks.

I came for lunch and am very happy I did. I was very impressed with the variety of options for Pho beef soup. The broth is delicious and chili sauce, crushed chili in oil, and Sriracha are well stocked at every table. They are pretty generous with the fresh basil, sprouts, and jalape√±os.  I was sold when I saw the menu online. It definitely looked like the real deal Holyfield. Pho with tendon, tripe, brisket, and all of the fixin's? "Oh yeah. I'm gonna eat that."  The service was good enough for dining alone. They pretty much bring you your food and leave you the heck alone to stuff your face in peace. That might not be ideal for a large group, though. The ambiance is very utilitarian, which I like, actually.  The strong flavorful iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk ended my meal perfectly. I think I've found my regular pho spot.

I stumbled across this place after missing my usual Light Rail stop on my way to pick up a Zipcar at the downtown ASU campus.  First I tried my usual caffeine fix...a nonfat double latte. Excellent.  Second trip back, I gave the breakfast burrito (plus bacon) a try. Delicious. The tortilla was as good as everything inside.  Third trip, a beet salad and a bacon chocolate chip cookie. Bacon and chocolate for the win!  I've been here three times and have not been disappointed. The decor is modest, but functional, as it should be at a good business with honestly good food. The barista is not only knowledgable and skilled, but is also a genuine sweetheart.  It's just a couple of blocks from the Jefferson and First Street Light Rail stop (East bound), so I've been stopping by on my way to work.

Freddy Rooter came to our (historic) home to fix a systemic clog that was affecting our kitchen sink, dish washer, and laundry washing machine. The plumber who came out did so on a Sunday evening, identified the problem quickly, and fixed it within an hour. The price was decent ($150).  If I could, I would post a rating of 4.5. The appointment process could use some fine-tuning. The time changed from Sunday afternoon, to Monday morning, to Sunday evening.  Overall, great job. I was pleased with the service in the end and would definitely recommend Freddy Rooter to my neighbors. The plumber who arrived had lots of experience in our neighborhood.

The bar is superb. Rich and Tyson are the real deal. This is the only place I've been to in a Red State that matches the authentic quality of East Coast bars.   Food? Never tried it, and who cares? Go to Applebees for that. A bar is all about the drinks, the bar tenders' personality and service, and the vibe. I will definitely be coming back.  (Anyone who is a regular, feel free to connect with me. I just moved to Phoenix from Boston and I'm looking for other expats...or those who are East Coast at heart)

"Burger place...Dominoe's...Nail spa...liquor store...oh, what is this place at the end of the sketchy strip mall? Asian FUSION? bleh...well, I need a drink so why not?"  That was my impression as I walked up to Sochu for the first time on a Sunday night. I opened the door and was immediately impressed. Super chic decor. When I was in Boston I frequented places like Cuchi Cuchi and Pho Republique, so it was a nice touch of nostalgia after moving away from the East Coast.  I sat at the bar and was greeted by Casey, a super friendly sweetheart. My first drink was the Mandarin Raimu, a light and fruity delicious saketini.  Next...the miso soup. I was expecting a tiny bowl of brownish liquid with rehydrated seaweed and maybe some bonus tofu bits. Thank goodness I was soooo wrong. What I got was a heaping pot of miso deliciousness. The piping hot broth had a rich and silky quality. It was loaded with mushrooms, tofu, and curious tender little rice dumplings.  Next was the almond fish (tapas). It was a moist flaky strip of white fish wrapped in a delicate thin layer of crisp tempura batter, topped with almonds and spices. The sauces that were served on the side had the type of spiciness that you can only get from freshly ground ingredients. One was pickled wasabi...REAL wasabi. The other was a chili-peanut sauce. Heavenly.  My desert was a chocolate coconut sake martini. A yummy and creamy ending (#noporno) to a great light meal. I will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.

I am a super busy person, so it's been difficult for me to find an opportunity to go to this place. I was curious ever since I heard that they specialize in really spicy food.  Los Dos Molinos did't fail to please. The outside looks a little generic, so when I walked in I was almost surprised to see such a beautiful and hip, yet traditional cantina style atmosphere with modern (electronica) music playing. The staff was friendly and down to earth.   The complimentary chips and salsas (one red, one green tomatillo) were very tasty. The green salsa was pretty serious...definitely hotter than the hottest salsa you get at the Taco Guild, but still flavorful and enjoyable. I am very happy that I finally found a place where I do not have to beg to get something that I consider spicy-hot.  I ordered a house margarita, blue corn tamale, and a side of rice and beans. I was amazed by the unique, smoky flavor of the tamale. The rice (yellow) and beans were very saucy, topped with a touch of melted shredded cheese, and delicious. I like that Los Dos is hip, but not above serving rice and beans. Best of all, the tamale had a spicy kick on its own.   Everything was delicious and what i considered to be spicy done right. People looking to have tears stream out of their eyes might be disappointed...but people who sneeze after just looking at a bottle of Frank's Red Hot would't be able to handle most of the dishes there (there is a little pepper icon next to the spicy stuff to help those with tender tongues find something palatable). I'll be going back soon.

Amazing. Another local Phoenix gem.  I'll try my best to use words to describe why these sandwiches are brilliant. They are pocket sandwiches cooked up superbly. The fillings are sliced delicately thin and diced just right. The fillings are tenderly nestled between two circular pieces of bread, and the whole thing is cooked so that the bread is toasty brown and the fillings are warm and juicy. The whole thing adds up to a party in your mouth. It's almost like a gourmet grilled cheese, but way more amaze-balls.  I had the #20, turkey, bacon, avocado with some amazing magical sauce in it. You get a small salad with any sandwich. I had the kale, nut, mandarin orange salad. As if the sandwich wasn't amazing enough, the salad put me over the edge.  On my second visit, I had the roast beef cheddar bacon (#35). Yum yum yum yum yum.  The service is great and the place is very cute.  I highly recommend Zookz for lunch.

Posted on behalf of my husband: "This review *would* be an amazing 5 stars. I used to frequent this location, and as a matter of fact I came and had the tacos earlier this week. So honestly I give the food service 5 stars. The staff is USUALLY professional, nice, and they serve great food."   "The only reason why this place gets 1 star from me tonight is because Yelp does not let reviewers give zero stars."  "The outside bartender was over-the-top rude. I'm not talking about Mike who came over from Sochu House (who is great), I'm talking about the bald A-hole working with Mike tonight. Is was ridiculous.  I know they were busy, but when does asking a bartender for a drink turn into a crazy, unreasonable inconvenience? It was a BAR. Where you get, you know, DRINKS. Paz, please do your great reputation a favor and can that clown. Thanks."
