I've been shopping at My Sisters Closet for over a decade & have never had these mishaps other reviewers have.  I have bought & sold.  I've seen their biz get bigger & bigger & their customer service get better.  I always feel like the staff treats me really well, like nicer than Nordstrom.  I've often told my employees to swing by so they know how to treat our clients.  5 stars hands down.

The Fried Chicken was really dry, but it was also delivered to me in Scottsdale, so possibly it sat too long.  The vegetables with it had zero seasoning and half were fresh, the green beans were canned.

Lime basil w/ lemon olive oil - DELISH!  Plus, you can play board games here!  So fun!

The lines are longer than Disneyland and not worth the experience of the ride.  Won't go back.

Love Beckett's Table!    It's California Food / Ambience with a neighborhood upstanding flair.  The menu is unique; The roasted red pepper soup is amazing with the grilled cheese sammy dipped!    In the spring, he did  grilled shrimp over grits, which created a craving, but it was a special.  Mussels were just okay, but apparently they have a crowd following (not for me).     Down to earth, Beckett's table only enhances our neighborhood!  So happy to have you here!

One of my favorite restaurants for atmosphere & certainly food.  The chopped salad will become your next craving!

Upscale, hip, trendy with Aaaahmazing, healthy Food.  It's like a Chipotle w/ Mediterranean food!  Put one of these up in Scottsdale/PV, please.

I'm a burger snob and these are Ahhhhmazing!  These burgers are huge, thick, juicy and perfectly done to your taste. And the bun - a perfectly soft brioche that melds into the burger.   They have many menu options at a great price, especially on happy hour.  And, if you like shakes (which I know doesn't help our diets) but they're loaded with the extras (brownie bites in chocolate and Nilla wafers in the Vanilla).    I can't wait to go back for more!  Hopefully, the District enters into the Burger Battle during Culinary Festival - definite winner!

We loved it!  I bought the First in Line Fast pass at $20pp - just get the regular $10 fast past.  The lines are long at the haunted houses, which I thought were totally scary!  The Zombie paint ball truck was fun to us as well, but the guns are attached to the truck.  I was on the left side and thought the right had more targets, yet we all ended at the same time, so I think that's perception and they're probably even.  On three people, we spent a lot of money on the tix and was in/out in an hour ready to go to another haunted house.  Overall, I loved it but probably wouldn't shell out that much money next time.  We did have a blast!

I stopped by on a whim to try Moroccan.  I ordered lamb chops, hummus & cucumber salad to go.  There was absolutely no flavor in any of my food.  The hummus was so bland it was near to nothing.  The small Lamb chops had no salt however were cooked medium when I asked for medium rare, so at least not well done - no taziki or any sauce was  with them.   Cucumber salad looked like it had dressing, however zero flavor.  So sad - was excited for a great new place when in Tempe.  I was the only customer - so technically no reason for not putting an ounce of love in my meal.
