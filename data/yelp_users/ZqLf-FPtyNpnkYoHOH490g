I have been dining here for 20+ years, and I hope it's around for 20 more. =)  There's nothing fancy about Goldon Wok, it's a simple chinese restaurant in a strip mall. The food is good, especially their egg rolls. The prices are reasonable, and the owners are very friendly. We often celebrate birthdays here with the extended family, and they are very accomodating for our large parties. We'll bring in a cake for dessert and they are happy to provide us with additional plates and silverware at no charge.

This place is known for their pizza, but personally, I find the pizza mediocre and overpriced. So why 4 stars?  The best hot subs I've ever had! The other italian dishes I've tried have been good as well, but the subs set Streets of New York apart from the rest. At dinner time, everone gets a complimetnary bowl of bread and marinara sauce.

I rarely enjoy bar food, but Teakwoods is a exception. I'm very impressed by their menu, and they always have great specialties in addition to their regular menu. While there isn't much of a scene here late nights, it's a great spot for happy hour. The drinks are cheap, and the casual atmosphere makes it a great place to unwind. Who doesn't love tossing peanut shells on the floor?

I'm known to rave about the food at Teakwoods, but my experiences were limited to the Chandler location. I took a friend to dinner at this Scottsdale location and learned that not all Teaks are created equal!  The bar area was packed so we had to get a table in the backroom which has a stale, impersonnal feeling like I was back in my middle school cafeteria. Sadly, the food here was just as un-impressive. I had the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and my friend had the Chicken Jack, Not  Jill but the name was much more exciting than the flavor. Both sadwiches were bland. Nothing to rave about, especially with a price tag of $10 per sandwich.  If you are in the bar area, I'm sure this is an enjoyable place to get a drink or watch the game. But I'll be avoiding this location when I want a meal.

Wow! Tired of my usual lunch spots, I decided to give The Lunch Bag a try and ordered the Turkey Green Chili sandwich.  I'm not a big meat eater and saw a pic of how thick with turkey this sandwich comes which made me a bit nervous - but it turns out that it was so fresh, I loved every bite!  And a tomato that fresh makes a big difference too.  I will definitely be back for this sandwich, and have already told my co-workers they need to head over there too.

If you are looking for contemporary furniture, this is the place to go! The furniture is sleek, stylish, and comfortable. If you aren't in a rush, you can order most pieces in just about any color if you don't want the color they keep in stock. The furniture is of better quality than the contemporary pieces you will find in most major furniture chains. Often a bit pricier as well, but worth it. And if you are looking at other contemporary boutiques (there are several in north Scottsdale) you will find Copenhagen is significantly cheaper and carries the same or very similar pieces.  If you are looking to fill a couple rooms, make sure to purchase everything at once - purchases over $5K get a 10% discount. Even if you don't need furniture, Copenhagen is a great stop for decor including candles, clocks, or rugs.

This review is based on the place as a drinking establishment. I have not tried their food, but have been here twice on Saturday nights and was not impressed by either experience.  The bar area is a bit tight and very loud. It's nearly impossible to have a conversation. The music is decent, though as someone else mentioned, very little of it is Irish. On my last visit, I realized the drink prices are high and the bartenders, perhaps not trustworthy.  My friend had opened our tab and thorughout the night I had 2 drinks while he had 4 - that's a TOTAL of 6 drinks, all wells. After closing the tab, he came over and told me the total bill - $60!!!!  I marched up to the bar to see how that could be and found they had added 4 more drinks to the tab, as well as charging an extra 1$ per drink because we'd asked for them tall (meaning a little more soda - most places don't charge for this). The bartender did not want to go through the hassle of voiding the CC transaction and instead said he'd refund us cash. The first refund was only for 2 drinks so we went back to ask about the rest. He said "oops" and gave us a refund for the other 2. We gave up and left at that point, but there still was no refund on the added $1 for those for drinks or the total tip which was based on a $60 bill that should have been $36.   I may be venting more than reviewing now, but take heed here and review your bill before paying it!

Martini & Mani $10, Dinner (from HH menu) $6-$8, Fun evening gabbing with your girls - Priceless!  We were told they would only take reservations for parties of 8 or more, so we were sure to arrive shortly after 5 so we would be near the front of the line for manicures. It actually never got too crowded, but the manicurist explained that it's typically slower during the holiday season. We dined and had our nails done within an hour and a half, but ofcourse chose to stay longer.  The martinis were fabulous! We ordered the Pretty in Pink (aka Cosmo), Royaltini (Chambord & White Chocolate Liquor), and Rasberry beret.  For dinner, we ordered the Caprese salad, Taylor Street Pasta, and their soup of the day which was artichoke and fontina. Yum! The pasta was the best deal with a good sized portion for only $6.  The service was also wonderful. My friend ordered a second martini and the waiter offered it to her on the house since there was  quite a wait before he delivered the drink. We'll definitely be back!

Oregano's is my #1 favorite restaurant. While it's known for it's pizza (which is fabulous) I have to recommend the Pablo Picasso Salad. My mouth waters just thinking about it! You don't need to be a salad fan to enjoy this feast. If you don't like spicy, just ask for the dressing on the side and add as much or little as you like. But I've introduced this salad to many who were less than excited to try it, but coudln't stop talking about how wonderful it was after cleaning their plate.  Make sure to save some room for the pizookie!

Having taken very few yoga classes in my life and being an anti-sweat kind of girl, I was very nervous about my first bikram class. But everyone is very welcoming and understanding of the mixture of levels in the class. I signed up for the 2-week trial and went almost every day. The instructors are all friendly and approachable before and after class. Not being familiar with the poses, I'm thankful for the pointers given during the class as well.  The yoga room fits about 50 students and is typically close to full, so it's good to get there early and claim your spot. Now that my 2-week trial is over, the price will prohibit me grom going as often but i do plan to continue. It's been great for flexibility, relaxation, and clarity, and I've even noticed that it's made me more tolerant of the summer heat! :)

We hit Bungalow for Happy Hour last Friday, and I was impressed. The food was great! We had the sliders and the spinach/artichoke dip. I very rarely eat any beef, but I would definitely order those sliders again! The cosmo was also very good. I enjoyed the atmosphere - it seemed like a slightly nicer version of Kona Grill in Chandler. The openness between the patio and the bar is nice. What knocks this place down a bit is their pricing. I certainly wouldn't call anything cheap, even during happy hour. But this is Scottsdale, I'd always stay in Chandler if cheap was the only criteria for enjoyment.

My friend really talked this place up so I was excited to try it, but we both walked out disappointed. I had the Chicken Italiano which is marinated chicken with provolone, spinach, and grilled onions.  This portion of the sandwhich was actually really good, but the bread was awful!  It seemed like it had been pulled out of a freezer. My friend was also disappointed in his cheesesteak, inside and out. The fries were quite tasty though :)  For $9 a sandwich, give me fresh bread!

I suppose the upside of a bad first date is that i've now tried a new restaurant to Yelp about, and I didn't even have to pay!  The atmosphere: I really liked the look and feel of this place. There was a large patio which was quite full of folks enjoying the nice weather we have right now. We sat inside the restaurant which was not as crowded. The colors and decor are trendy, with a relaxed vibe. The music selection was very good, though much too loud.   The food: We started with the crab puffs. I'm not sure what the dipping sauce was that they came with but my date seemed to like it. I, however, was not a fan.  Next was the sushi. We ordered California rolls and Las Vegas rolls. Not very adventurous, I know, but they even managed to go wrong with these basics! I would have to declare these the worst sushi rolls I've ever had.  Dessert - the saving grace. We ordered the green tea ice cream and I was surprised when they brought such a large bowl to the table! This was quite enjoyable.  While I won't be back here for sushi, I can see where this may be a good place to have a cocktail or two. Some of the selections on the drink menu sounded quite good, and very reasonable happy hour prices. I refrained from trying any though since I was with someone who doesn't drink.

After visiting the Phx Art Museum, my friend and I were thrilled to find this little cafe with outdoor seating as we were strolling down Central enjoying the nice weather. The prices are reasonable, and they offer many discounts including 10% off for teachers. The cheesy potato soup was wonderful! I also really enjoyed the chicken curry sandwich, while my friend raved about his huge slice of quiche. And as others have mentioned, the staff was very friendly.

I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to shopping, so I usually avoid used and consignement stores due to the aggravation of sifting through a ton of junk to find anything good.  But after reading the other Yelp reviews of Turn Style and realizing it was right down the street, I decided to check it out and I'm sure glad I did! The store is very well organized by color and by style which made it easy to find what I was looking for, and the fashions were all current.  I walked out with several items of clothing and jewelry without having to spend much time or money. I'll definitely be back to shop, and will probably bring some of my stuff to conisign with them.

I'm a big fan of lunch stops with good salads and sandwiches. Spicy Pickle is a welcome addition to this list. I've yet to try the pizetti (though it looks good) but the salads and sandwiches I've had have all been delicious. The spinach salad has apples, walnuts, and bleu cheese with an apple cider vinaigrette. Very tasty, though there was a bit too much vinnaigrette at my last visit.  There are several sandwich selections to choose from, but I think the best is to build your own from their list of ingredients.  There are deffinitely enough toppings to make a sandwich to your liking, and I highly recommend choosing the sundried tomato mayo as your spread! Several cheeses to choose from as well, with my favorite being the smoked mozerella.  As if that wasn't good enough, I learned that Monday's are free cookie day! .Heaven. The chocolate chip cookie is soft - a little crunchy on the outside yet doughy in the middle. Perfect :)

I'll give a thumbs up for their mango margherita, but that's it. From the moment we arrived (a party of 4) there were issues as the hostess tried to figure out where she could seat us among the many open tables, several of which were apparently reserved. But the clodk was ticking till happy hour would end, so we just wanted a seat. The table service was very slow, and the food was not good. The description of their chile relleno (stuffed with raisins and other goodies) sounded mouth watering, but when it arrived it was mainly breading covering a small chile, stuffed only with plain cheese. For that price???     If all you want is a drink, sure, go here. I won't be back.

Peach yogurt with fresh kiwi on top - YUM! Perhaps I'm glad it's such a drive. If they open one close to me, I'll be dropping a lot of money here!

I used to love the calzones and pizza, as well as the atmosphere, at this restaurant back when it was Our Gang. So I was thrilled to learn it still existed, just under a new name. I bought a certificate on restaurant.com and grabbed 2 friends to try out Il Posto.  The fresh bread and delicious pesto dip they brought out was a good sign of things to come. We decided to share 2 dishes, and ordered a baked pasta dish along with the eggplant pamigiana based on Sarabear's yelp review - who I hope spelled parmigiana right cuz I'm just copying her spelling =).   Well the eggplant was every bit as good as she said! All three of us were very impressed by this dish. The pasta, however, seemed to be lacking in flavor. It was decent, but paled in comparison.  We had a very hard time deciding what to order as there were many mouth-watering items on the menu from salads to sandwhiches, and ofcourse the pizza and calzones. I will definitely be back to try out some others. They are also in the process of opening a lounge attached to the restaraunt, so Iook forward to checking that out as well!

I went to Murphy's Law on a Wednesday night around 9pm, but it sure seemed like a Friday. We walked in to live music and a lively crowd. When I asked if week nights were usually so busy, I was told this was actually a slow night for this bar!  So we found a table and ordered some drinks and appetizers.  The service was a bit slow, but the atmosphere was good so I really don't even think I would have noticed the lag in getting our food if it wasn't for the fact I was starving when we walked in. I had the chicken nachos, wow were they good!  My friend said the spciy wings weren't very spicy, but still tasted very good.  Did I mention they have a reverse happy hour with 1/2 price appetizers?! Take note that this doesn't start until 10pm though. When we ordered ~9:30 the waitress told us the appetizers were half off, but our bill was for full price since she entered it into their computer before 10pm. Kudos to the owner for talking to us and changing our bill since the waitress had given us incorrect information. :)

I fully agree with Ted's review of Jersey's. I love a bar that offers fun things to do while having some drinks!  Between pool, Wii, and Cornhole (aka Bags) there's always fun to be had here. On Tuesday nights (after ~9:30) they provide free homemade tacos which are quite tasty. And kudos to the owner for providing a free shuttle to/from your home to prevent customers from drinking and driving!
