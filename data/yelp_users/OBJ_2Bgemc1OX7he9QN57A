My son and I visited CPK Desert Ridge on May 12th after a movie at the AMC. I recall eating at a CPK at The Mirage in Las Vegas over 18 years ago and I remember it being good and kinda the latest trend. We were promptly greeted and seated. The host was great. HOWEVER, It was at least 15 mins. before any waiters acknowledged us. When one did, she wasn't our waiter but said she would give our drink order to our waiter. Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY. We placed our order immediately in hopes of eating sometime in this decade. Since it had been so long since I'd eaten at a CPK, I asked the waiter if one pizza was enough for 2 people and he said no. So we ordered two, one kinda traditional pizza with pep, sausage etc and one chicken tostada pizza. I'd guess 10 mins passed by the time our food came, with which we were pleased. When I saw how big they were, I was kinda surprised. We would have been more than full on one pizza. But I can't fault the waiter for that. He had no way of knowing if we are big eaters or not. We dug in. I first had a slice of the chicken tostada. My son, the meat pizza. Mine was "okay" not a whole lot of flavor even with the salsa. My son's however was really yummy. I ended up having a slice of his since he was raving about it. He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste. We ended up leaving with 2 half pizzas. I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us. Would I go back, yes, but I'd ask to be seated in the large dining room, not off to the side where we were seated, I'm sure that is why we were ignored for so long.

The owner's and staff at Nails R Us are great. The owners are so accommodating, they will open early or stay late when needed. They do a great job at HALF the price some of the nail salons in the same area. The shopping center is a bit lack luster but it's never hard to find parking the grocery store there has a coffee shop inside so I will usually grab a coffee then go take a seat in the salon to be pampered. They do foot massages, callus removal and masques for no extra charge. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!!!
