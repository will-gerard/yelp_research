My husband wanted to surprise me with flowers while I am home on maternity leave, he gave instruction not to ring the door bell, just in case our baby was sleeping..The man who delivered the flowers actually scared the h*ll out of me! I was nursing my baby, therefore could not come to the door and he stood there ringing and knocking on the door for 10 minutes while my dogs were going crazy. I was actually terrified to answer..I had to stop my baby from eating to see who this psycho was...when I finally figured it out after calling my husband ..the guy was getting in his car.. as I was opening the door HE had the nerve to roll his eyes and act in annoyance! maybe this company needs to figure out a more beneficial delivery strategy or don't hire psychotic drivers. ..Although HE was "successful" in making his delivery..I will never recommend this company to delivery. .stick to in store pick up...nice flowers and a fussy baby..thanks a lot

Wow - we haven't even been to this office yet and have already been given a bad impression. . I called to reschedule my sons appointment and the front desk clerk had a major attitude problem. This is a disappointment, because we received a recommendation from a friend. I am going to keep the appointment and see how the visit goes. Based on these other reviews it seems like they have good doctors and when I called the first time a few weeks ago the girl was pleasant during our phone schedule, but the one I dealt with today should maybe find a job where she doesn't need to handle customers. ..its not for everyone.

I can't say enough good things about Sage Hospice, they cared for my grandma during her last couple months with Dementia and Alzheimer's and they were quick to respond when I called about my good friend needing care for his cancer. I called just to get general questions and Tiana returned my call that day, but I missed her call, so she then text me letting me know that I can reach her day or night and even weekends if I needed. She reached out to my friend that same week after telling her about his diagnoses and she visited him at his home. He has been having depression and anxiety and for once in months they were able to give him reassurance and allow him to feel he is in good hands. They aren't just there for people in there last days of life, they are available whenever needed. I so appreciate Tiana and Sage Hospice, they are true hero's and angels.

Have tried several times to order for delivery because I am home with a new baby...I will go through the online delivery processes just to get a call saying they are currently not delivering. Then it takes several days to get my money put back on my card. Seems like they pick and choose when they want to deliver, why bother being a company that "offers" delivery?? Their food is pretty good, but their soups are horrible.
