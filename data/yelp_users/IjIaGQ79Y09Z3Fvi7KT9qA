I'm solely giving this place 2 stars due to the selection of wigs. Despite positive reviews and accolades for Renee, I found her to be incredibly rude, dismissive and indifferent. I almost walked out. I've been to many wig shops and this is the only one where, upon selecting the wig, the employee hasn't helped me with it. She didn't help me until saw me fiddling with it. Even upon donning it, she offered no help fixing it or styling it. Additionally, she also offered me the mirror about 3.5 feet from the front door, where customers come in/walk out/etc, when there was a vanity in the back seemingly good for use albeit looking more like a storage area than anything; which Renee forewarned was messy. Additionally, she kept pressing me to pick a style, whereas my focus was the color first, then style.  I saw a couple colors I liked in their packaging but she didn't want to even take them out so I could see them.  Instead. she showed me the style of the wig in an undesirable color.  I could not have been more annoyed.  If she needed help (although the store wasn't busy), maybe she could have asked the gentleman behind the counter on his iPhone the entire time to assist her...

I will never order take out or eat in this establishment again.  It was the grossest, worst-tasting Chinese delivery I have ever had.  I had simple items as well.  I ordered egg flower soup which was terribly awful , house fried rice which was mediocre, and orange chicken which was flaccid and floppy.    Please save your money and your taste buds!

Despite feeling like you might get carjacked, stabbed or robbed every second while waiting for your food, this place is excellent!  To avoid a wait while outside of their window, I suggest  calling ahead, however, you can walk up and order.  Usually the gal who answers says it'll be 10 minutes...be prepared for a 20-25 minute wait at times.  I am a fan of the veggie egg fu young, steamed broccoli, sesame chicken, orange chicken, egg drop soup sans chicken, french fries, fried mushrooms (these are huge, like as big as tomatoes)..the list goes on.  Their combo plates have fed our family of four when we've also added an appetizer.  It's truly some of the best Chinese I've had in downtown Phoenix.  I'd equate this place to any dive Chinese joint in a large city like NY, Chicago, etc.  It looks totally unappealing but is a treasure! I have never seen anything bad happen here but  I always wear closed-toe shoes and have my hair pulled back when going here.......It seems less scary during the daytime and when the guys who work at the car repair shop right across the street are still around which I have seen be as late as 8.  Please give this little place a shot and, remember, it's cash only!!  And, there's no ATM on site either.

This is one of the few places in the Valley that our whole little family will ALWAYS agree upon to go to for dinner.   Our children are ages 9 and 16 so there's even great things for them to eat that the chef can make especially for the little one.  Our eldest usually just eats from the regular menu.    We have not had their sushi or oysters but have heard they are tasty.  Our faves from the apps menus are: the jumbo lump crab cake (that remoulade sauce is incredible)**this is a must try**, the point judith calamari (has an asian theme that will blow your tongue away), and crispy salt and pepper shrimp.   Of the Second Courses, we have had the fabulous maine lobster and shrimp bisque**this is a must try**, the fuji apple salad, classic caesar salad, and the baby iceberg BLT.  Ok as far as steaks and seafood go, we havw had so many, we would highly recommend most of them.  I personally really enjoy the swordfish and the chilean sea bass.  Of the beef, I recommend the filet mignon and ribeye.  Now, the sides, the crab fried rice with mushrooms are the bomb! Truffled mac and cheese, parm and chive french fries and the sauteed spinach are also quite good.    Lastly, let's cove the service and ambiance.  Every time we've been to Wildfish everyone from the hostess, server, busser, to the bartender(s) have been excellent.  We have hardly ever had a wait.  The music is always nice and relaxing.  You really can't go wrong with a romantic date night with your loved one, someone you're dating, your family, or a medium or large group.

My husband, kids and I feel this is an absolute staple in our romantic date nights as well as our fun family nights.  Parking is never an issue as there is a three or four story garage, you receive a pass that gets validated for free inside since you are partaking in a movie.   Once inside, or online beforehand, not only do you have a choice in movies and times, you also get to choose if you want to be a "Cinema Suites" patron or a "Fork and Spoon " patron.  In the Cinema Suites, thee are absolutely no children under 21, even if they are are there with you, it was last minute, no one can watch the , bah , blah , blah- no getting in!.  For singles, this is a glorious gift from the heavens, no chance of crazy little kids running around everywhere, making noises, etc.  For parents, this kind of sucks if there's a perfect showtime and it's a movie that everyone wants to see, especially when you have older children.  The nice thing is , it kind of forces parents to have a date night sans kids.  Another added bonus a  Now once you are in your seat, time to feast.  This food is phenomenal considering it is movie theater food. There's a good selection of appetizers:I recommend the parmesan fries, bread basket, veggie trio, and the hot wings.  There's a lot of sandwiches, I recommend: The Prime Rib Dipper(?), The Lime Chicken Griller (?), The Turkey Sandwich, Now onto the Pizzeta's! Yumm.  Try them all.  The only negative report i Have on the  Esplanade;s Menu are the "Million Dollar Milkshakes"  I've had mine remade only to have to have have same conclusion;it tastes like it was made with water, not milk.   Overall, the customer service, the attentiveness of our server and

Worst practice I have ever been to.  The front desk ladies chat out loud like it's happy hour.  There is ALWAYS a wait to see my doctor, Dr. Wetherell, who by the way, I had to wait to see 3 months to see as a new patient.  Anytime I was sick, I called to make an appointment and there was always at least a two day minimum wait.  Once I needed a med refill and she was out of the office.  I couldn't get me refill because none of the other docs can refill for her patients.  She really does take the time to listen when you can actually get in to see her. It is honestly easier to go to urgent care.  The best thing about TIM is Jennifer, Dr. Wetherell's MA.   Now this is the last straw.  Apparently, I had 2 unpaid bills which totaled $40.  I knew I had one bill for $10 and I had said I would take care of it the next time I was in.  Well the next time I was in it slipped my mind and the women at the front desk  (of course) were too busy horsing around to ask me to clear my balance.  Supposedly Margie (maybe their billing lead) sent numerous letters which I never received and called once.  So, I was "dismissed " from the practice (I just found this out today).  I called today to clear everything up simply because I knew it had been outstanding.  The $40 is now $80 because it was sent to collections.  I suppose this practice has enough wherewithal to get an entire collections agency set up to get their beloved $40 but cannot pick up the phone to call me to collect a balance.   It is truly appalling and sickening that a practice can be so money hungry and greedy.  Furthermore, all the billing department had to do was call.  I don't understand what is so hard about that.    I will be sure to advise anyone I know to stay far away from this office.  It's simply not worth the hassle and no one should be subjected to their lack of patient ethics.

I have the best physical therapist, tech and intern in the world who have been assisting me through a shoulder injury.  Sean, Carlos and Mari (respectively) really help me through every move, make sure I am executing them accurately, and swiftly move me through my sets.  I am really happy with the treatment I receive at this clinic and how well I am improving.  They are also very patient with me as I tend to have to cancel a lot for various reasons.    The best part of my one and a half session is the massage by Sean or Mari!

If you're in need of a beautiful, custom cake for any special occasion this is NOT the place to give your business. I highly advise and implore you to never discuss details of your desired cake with Grace (a solution-less employee) or even remotely consider this business to fulfill the dessert needs of your special day. This company has left me without my one-year-old's first birthday cake 3 days before the party when I called 8 days prior to the pickup date. I'm aware of their 7 day policy for custom orders as I've been a customer for over 6 years. I was told to email ideas from Pinterest or Google images. Keep in mind that I wasn't told a specific date or deadline to send in my ideas (the idea that the customer even has to take this step when they're paying for custom design is ludicrous) and being that I hadn't been contacted, I thought all was a-go. I thought I'd be called if there was ANY issue with execution. It's certainly not my responsibility to manage their production schedule and/or know how busy or not busy they are. Proactively I took the extra step in calling to check the status as I hadn't heard from anyone only to be told that my ideas were sent in too late and they couldn't provide service. It's clear that as this company has grown, they've, sadly, failed at managing their ballooning production schedule, leaving the customer sans dessert for their once-in-a-lifetime events. The worst part of this experience is that after being told "Oh sorry, we didn't receive your concepting/ideation for the cake 'in time'" I was given NO solution as to what could be done, if anything. It wasn't until I mentioned the lack of solution-offering to Grace that she put her customer service hat on and offered an idea of a solution (but not give it to me) then tell me since I'm upset she'll "try" to have a manager call me "sometime". After that I hung up. I don't appreciate being treated like a child, being given the idea that there could be a solution but since I was upset, as some sort of ill-conceived punishment, I wouldn't be apprised of what the solution was. Unfortunately, after such a lack of empathy or any modicum of understanding, I reciprocated the apathy and realized there was no way to "Grace"-fully get out of the conversation. Phoenix, order your cakes and cupcakes elsewhere.

My second venture to this store was yesterday afternoon.  My sister loves Rihanna and her cosmetic collection and since visiting late last year, I've become interested in Mac products, after being a Chanel fan for years.  What a mistake.  When I walked in yesterday, a gentleman with the worst teal colored contacts I've seen approached me, clearly disinterested.  I told him I was interested in Rebel but was unsure and wanted to try other colors.  I also mentioned I like my RiRi lipstick and wanted a matte lipstick.  He chose a few colors for me and grabbed a liner for me, seemingly annoyed.  He disappeared for a few minutes, came back, and handed me the three lipsticks and liner while noting "I sanitized all these for you." Umm, thanks, is that not your job?  I applied the colors alone and went back & forth a bit because I was undecided.  He checked on me once, sort of, then literally was gone.  I was considering purchasing, but due to the lack of customer service and not a soul to grab what I wanted, I walked out.

I cannot commend this pharmacy enough. Excellent prices, service, selection. Greg is awesome! Gilbert and Chad are great too. I've been more than impressed and pleased with this place and have transferred nearly all of my prescriptions here. No fuss and you're out of there in 20 minutes!  While you wait there are many cute little products throughout the store like custom soaps, stuffed animals, and homeopathic products.

John is great! With the recent fluctuation of weather, we've had a gnat attack. Living downtown and having a huge pool, we're prone to those heinous roaches too. It was time to call pest control indeed. He came back three times until we were satisfied. The level of customer service is top notch and highly recommended. The reason I've given 4, not 5 stars is due to the fact that the gnats didn't decrease until we purchased traps. We did just spot a small roach yesterday so that was disappointing but I know they can't all be gone forever.

We had EnviroControl visit us again for a re-spray. I have a bit of a roach phobia and the recent weather has caused these little buggers to come out. My father saw one late at night and the next morning I called for service. John tried his best to make it that day but,due to a hectic schedule, he came the next day which was a Saturday. Once again, we received excellent service and we heeded his advice on an extra product to use. I can honestly say we will be exclusively utilizing EC for our future pest control needs!   I'd also like to mention that this is a real review and not some fake accolade per the accusation made by another reviewer. I'm a real customer and I wasn't coerced , persuaded or bribed into reviewing. Any presumption of this sort is inaccurate.

I first experienced the Daily Dose in Scottsdale so when I saw they opened a location in the Biltmore area I was super excited!  One evening my husband I were desperately looking around for a place that either delivered or we could pick up take out.  So I mentioned to my hubby about the new Daily Dose around the corner.  They closed at 9 and we literally called at 8:45 to place 2 full meals, and appetizers.  We ordered a full rack of ribs, salmon, and crab cakes as the appetizer.  The entrees came with julienned veggies and a full salad (house or caesar.)  We are not fans of julienned veggies so those were a waste.    However, the salmon was excellent.  I asked for no BBQ and just had it blackened and well-done (which I love!)  I was given a nice amount of salmon, not a small piece.  For it being the end of the night, the fish was cooked nicely and was still fresh.    My husband got a full rack of ribs and those were amazing.  The only possible complaint I might have about those is that they were a bit salty but I don't cook with salt so that might have been it.  The rib meat literally fell off the bone....so incredible!  I am so happy there is a place by us that has delectable ribs.  If you go to Daily Dose for dinner please try the ribs! They are truly delicious!   The crab cakes were quite good; there were three of them atop a bed of a corn salsa.  There were a few sauces including a creme aioli type sauce and green chile salsa.  The cakes were very yummy.   When we stopped in to get our food I asked if it was too late to order a sangria which they said it was- bummer.  But, the kind cute little bartender let me have a generous sample of the frozen sangria from their machine-deeeeeelicious!    I can't wait to go back to try more sangria and also more items from the menu.  This restaurant was a little pricey so bring some money honey! $65 was our total.

At first I thought this spine doctor/pain management doctor was having a bad or long day on my first visit.  He was very cold, arrogant and disinterested.  I have a very sore, bad , aching back from injuries caused by a fall.  Of course he says my back is "unremarkable" and I don't need surgery which I never purported I did.  He has awful bedside manner and generally a bitter disposition overall.   The second time I came in it was supposed to be a follow up, but I wanted to let him know my lumbar part of my back was really really hurting.  So he examined it quickly and actually wrote and order for an MRI.  That's the best thing that came out of this appointment.  Once again, he was condescending, arrogant, rude and overall unpleasant.     I highly suggest not going to see this particular doctor if you have back issues.  There are plenty of doctors here.    After my two experiences, I finally did a search...hah! Very low ratings and a few stories mimic mine.    http://www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratings/894413/Dr-Christopher+W.-Huston-PHOENIX-AZ.html  http://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-christopher-huston-x2c4y/patient-ratings
