The bartender acted like she had better places to be. I tried to keep my sunny disposition but it was a challenge. The cocktail waitress was a lot friendlier until we had a mixup about my order. That put me on her bad side quickly, but she eventually warmed  back up--a little.  The food was salty for some items & dry for others. I will happily spend money for good food. However $100+ for mediocre chicken wings? I can think of much better ways to blow my money.

Over the phone, Ms Renee took my order herself on very short notice: Prom night was Saturday 5/11, and I'm pretty sure I called her near closing time on Wednesday 5/8.  She even accepted a photo of the dress via cell phone!  She was awesome!  I had misunderstood the kind of flowers I should have expected--a fact I did not learn until I dropped by the day after our phone call so I could get an idea of how the corsage & bouteniere were going to look.  She was gracious enough to allow me in--in spite of the fact that her store was closed with the hours of operation clearly posted on the door. While I would totally understand if she just told me to come back the next day, I was SO grateful that I looked a LITTLE bit harmless. :-) I got educated on the flowers that would become the corsage and bouteniere.  I went home VERY confident that my son's date would LOVE the final product, and Ms Renee did NOT disappoint.  My husband was the one who managed to pick up everything for me, and he was very pleased with the results as well.  My son's date LOVED her corsage, as well as my son, who was SUPER unhappy about having to attend the prom was rewarding careful t preserve his bouteniere for Senior Memory Book.  Ms Renee: It was a SUPREME PLEASURE to do business with you, and I will be certain to recommend you to anyone needing floral expertise going forward.  A MILLION THANKS for taking my order on short notice, your AWESOME customer service in person AND by phone, and for making such LOVELY accessories that couldn't have been more perfect for the evening.    You will hear from me again! 8-)

Boo on this place. SOOO BOO. Boo, HISS.   Yeah. It was as bad as they say.   The hubby and I opted for this place yesterday after a survey of the area for other eateries. I wanted to try the Italian joint across the way, but no no, no no, he had a hankerin' for some BBQ. So we go in.   I never did get the saw dust on the floor. Is it a clever way to keep from ever having to clean it? Just an aside comment; not really anything to do with the food.   While we wait, we get water in mason jars. I love mason jars, so I thought we were off to a good start. But then the cornbread comes, and it was all downhill from there. And not in a good way. The cornbread was cold and flat, and I think it had cinnamon or something in it... Another reviewer mentioned taking lessons from Jiffy Mix.. Well, I have to agree with them there.   I ordered the sampler with brisket, pulled pork and a hotlink. My brisket looked like it was on the verge of becoming beef jerky--it was SO dry-looking, my pulled pork looked dry and sullen (as if the pig said, "my whole life has been leading up to THIS moment???"), and my link, while tasty, seemed more like breakfast sausage with a little kick to it. My remedy to make it through the driest BBQ on record? BBQ sauce. Drown it all in BBQ Sauce, and all was instantly better.   My two side orders were the never-ending sweet potato fries and the fried corn on the cob. The fries were okay; the fried corn I could totally live without.   My husband had the rib eye steak. He ordered it medium well; it came to the table medium rare. And it had the nerve to be tougher than cow hide.  The "veggies" were pitiful: onion, bell pepper and zucchini. WTH???   So when we finish, I ask my husband, "one star or two?" He says, "half a star."   His half plus my half make one whole star. So there you have it.

I'm always apprehensive about Chinese food buffets, because they almost always seem to serve second-rate food...  This joint just backs every prejudice I have against Chinese food buffets.  The food is mediocre, though well-priced, and the service leaves a lot to be desired.    The veggies in the springrolls were overcooked, so they took on a semi-mushy texture, they should NEVER attempt to make sushi again, and their noodles were so underseasoned that even soy sauce couldn't help them.  I did enjoy the crab legs, but even that could have been served a little warmer.  Bottom line: I was SO not impressed.

O.M.G. This place is AWESOME.  Initially one would say it's a carnivore's paradise, do NOT sleep on the salad bar.  Now I love me some cow and chicken just like the next person, but the salad bar is what it's all about for me.  I've eaten there three times over the past four months, and the one word that comes to mind: Consistency.  Fogo de Chao not only delivers the same great food time after time, they have EXCELLENT customer service.  Wanna know how good it is? My husband and I had a bit of a challenge transitioning our 6 month old son (now 8 months old) from the bottle onto other foods. On our first visit to Fogo de Chao, a relative offers up "give him a lamb bone"... so we do, and he LOVED it.  In fact, my husband had to fight the kid to get it back out of his hand (true story!).  If you are looking for a way to sample several cuts of meat while being fulfilled by an incredible salad bar, Fogo de Chao just might be the place for you.  Oh, and the desserts are amazing.  My ONLY gripe about this place is that they don't offer bottomless fountain drinks for the non-alcoholics like myself.  If you like Coke, Sprite, diet, etc, be prepared to pay $2.50 a pop (no pun intended) every time they bring one of those little 6oz bottles out to your table.  I guess they figure if you can pay big bucks for the dinner, what's a few more bucks for a soft drink?  My recommendation: come HUNGRY, or you will waste your hard-earned money.

My husband took me here for our first wedding anniversary.  We liked it so much, we took our friends for their fifth wedding anniversary.  Let me say that the first thing that let me know I was in for a treat was the ambiance. The decor had a retro-modern feel, and the view - day or night- is spectacular. I don't believe there's a bad table in the house.  So we have our priorities straight right? The first thing we order are the drinks: a double Martel for him, a Sprite with green olives for me.  (Cut me a break; I was 4 months preggers at the time, and the olives make me appear as though I'm "doin' something", lol.)  After we get that out of the way, next come the appetizers: Tuna Tartar, Crispy Calamari, and last but FAR from least, the Peekytoe Crab Cakes. In a word: YUM. And that was just the beginning.  For my entree, I orded the House Salad, the 12oz Filet Mignon (I was preggers, what did you expect?), Potatos Gratin with Comte (don't know what the Comte is, but it really doesn't matter... the sh* was GOOD).  I have NO complaints about the service.  The staff was friendly, and attentive without being overbearing.  They definitely earned their 20%.    Would I go again? HECK yes.  Make sure you save your pennies; it's gonna cost you all of the pretty ones, because you know this kind of dining ain't cheap.

Mmmm, mmm! That's all I gotta say.  Okay, maybe I have a little more to say, like just try the double-wrapped beef enchiladas (#12), and you may be ruined for anything else on the menu.  While my family prefers the machaca beef burrito, I am hopelessly devoted to order #12.  Devine as well.  It's arguably the best mexican food in Phoenix. Seriously.  I only give it four stars because I haven't tried anything else yet.

I've eaten here twice now, just to be sure of whether I liked it or not.  I'm sad to say, eh... Not so much.  I tried their carne asada tacos, and the meat was so dry I had to drown it in lime just to get it down.  The enchiladas are a little better, but not much--unless you get the cheese.    I could live without or without this place, which is such a bummer because it's so close to home for me.

They fired Asia the eye lash lady. I have no reason to go back there now. . Talk about upset! They are not very bright. They didn't even have the sense to find a suitable replacement. I am not going back unless they bring her back. What sucks more is that we have no way to contact her.
