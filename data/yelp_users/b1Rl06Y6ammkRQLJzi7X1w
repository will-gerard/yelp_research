Best Jewish deli in town. Sandwiches are awesome. The chopped liver is so good. Fantastic pastrami and brisket. The Reuben sandwich is killer. Definitely should check this place out if you haven't already.

I hate to do it, but I guess I need to join the bandwagon of bad reviews for this place. I've been going to Zipps for years, and still will because I love the food, but this is not a food complaint.   My friend and I went in last night after work to get some late night food and drinks. I wanted to treat him because I recently received an AMERICAN EXPRESS gift card for $100. We were there for awhile enjoying ourselves thoroughly. We then asked for the bill, which came to be over $100 just for the two of us. Our bartender Rachel, who gave us great service by the way, handed us our bill which was on a check presenter with an AMERICAN EXPRESS symbol on it. I put the gift card down and was going to pay the rest on my debit card. Our bartender, came over, and politely and seemed almost embarrassed, explained that the owners refuse to take AMERICAN EXPRESS gift cards. Which makes absolutely no sense, because it is the same as using the credit card, there is just a limit on this. They are excepted everywhere that takes AMERICAN EXPRESS. So my friend asked to speak to the manager. Nice enough guy came over. Explained that, yes, the owners refuse to take it, even though they except AMERICAN EXPRESS. Said he wouldn't run it because he didn't want to have to explain to his boss/owner.  I suggested maybe putting a sign up, or letting your guests know ahead of time, before racking up a bill of over $100, in a place where the check average isn't very high. He agreed, but said there is nothing he could do, and honestly seemed to care less, thanked us, and walked away. So, my friend and I payed the bill with our money. A bill we would have never gotten so high, if we had just known ahead of time, that they will not expect, that form of AMERICAN EXPRESS. I mean is that even legal if they do except AMEX?  Owners pay attention. Because you seem to be upsetting a lot of people in this town.

Wow! I've never seen so much dust in a restaurant in my entire life. If they don't care about cleaning the front, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  No thanks!

Simply wonderful! Loved it so much when I went for dinner that I came back the next day for happy hour. The pork belly pastrami appetizer was unbelievable. I could eat 15 of just that. The scallops were sensational. The mac and cheese spoke directly to my heart. The desserts were amazing as well. Service was also great. This is now my new favorite place and will be back as soon as possible.

Just a perfect place to go with friends, sit outside, and eat an awesome breakfast. The food is always amazing. The fresh squeezed juices are the best. Everything comes out super fast and the service is great. By far, my favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale.

Food was fantastic. Every course just kept getting better and better. Decor could use a little work. Tables don't really belong, but whatever. I'm there for the food and it was delicious!

Reserved a spot on the back patio for my birthday a couple weeks ago. They had a huge table set up for us when we arrived. Service was perfect. I believe Sam was who waited on us, and he did an amazing job with the amount of people we had. Food and drinks, as always, were great. Best Sunday brunch in town. And the staff and owners could not be nicer people!

The food is fantastic. I always have to get the grilled octopus and asparagus. The scallops are divine and the duck confit just melts in your mouth. Be prepared to be there for at least a couple of hours. And you might have to wait 20 minutes for each cocktail. But other than that it's great.

Simply one of the worst experiences ever. I went in for the first time on Sunday around 1:30 in the afternoon to meet a couple friends at the bar. At this point it really wasn't very busy there. I waited almost 20 minutes, while watching 2 to 3 bartenders and a manager, walking up and down the bar, without even glancing at anyone, until finally, a bartender came over. I feel he only came over because he heard me and my girlfriend talking about how we have been waiting. Plus, when he came over to get our order, all he said was "What do you want?". Straight face. Sunglasses on. Could have cared less. Do these people not realize that they are in the hospitality business working for tips? Later, we made the mistake of asking for a cherry bomb shot. Shot being the key word. He gave me cherry vodka and an entire can of rockstar, filled to the top, in a cocktail glass. I asked the manager if he could remake it into a shot version, because it was way too much rockstar. He looked at me like I had no idea what I was talking about. Even though I have been in the restaurant and bar business in Scottsdale for over 15 years. The manager rolled his eyes at me, remade the drink, and basically slid it on the bar in front of me. Without saying a word. I truly hope the owners read this and take a good hard look at the staff they have behind the bar. Honestly, some of the most unfriendly and inexperienced group I've seen in Scottsdale. LOL, and thats saying a lot.

I was a frequent Uber user, and by frequent, I mean multiple times a week.  They tried to charge me $50 for a cleaning fee, from some dog hair that was left on the seat. After the driver gave us full permission to bring our small dog in the car. I said I wouldn't pay, so then they came back and said how about $25. Also, when looking at my bank statements, there were two charges that suddenly appeared, that were incorrect. They just want to scam you for money. Be warned. Don't use Uber. It seems great until they try to scam you. Oh, and there customer service is some of the worst Ive encountered. Save your self the headache and go with a different company.

Restaurant is gorgeous. Service was great. The food was absolutely delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are heavenly. My only negative are the chairs. They are clear and made of some plastic like material with faces on them. Very uncomfortable to sit in and they just look kind of strange in the restaurant. Other than that small detail everything was wonderful.

Went in for the first time a couple weeks ago with a friend of mine for lunch. Was super excited because I live a block away, and have always been a fan of The Vig Arcadia. The experience, unfortunately, not so great. We sat at the bar, which we normally do, at the Arcadia location. There was a female bartender working, and did not seem to know a single thing. I asked her if they had the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for the greyhounds, like they do in Arcadia, and she said she didn't know but would go ask for me. Ten minutes go by, and still nothing. So I ask her again about the grapefruit juice, because I really wanted a drink. She then tells me she is waiting to ask the manager, who is busy at the moment doing inventory, and she " didn't want to bother him" . That bothering him was never a good idea. Meantime, my friend and I have just been sitting there with waters. No order had been taken yet. Finally we place our food order , and the food comes, which is always delicious. But, still no drinks yet. A good thirty minutes have gone by at this point. She then comes over to us after we were almost done with our food to see how we were doing. I tell her since she still doesn't know if they have grapefruit juice, that I will just take a bloody mary. Another cocktail they are known for. She apologizes, telling me she was still waiting for the manager. Who, by the way, has been behind the bar at least three times at this point. My friend and I just start laughing at how hilarious this whole experience has been thus far. I mean its pretty rare you ask an employee for something three times, and still don't get it. Oh, and when she gave me my bloody mary, it came with no garnish. Just a glass with bloody mary mix and vodka. Big let down there. The manager came by at the end to see how we were, and we didn't want to say anything, because the bartender made it pretty clear, it wasn't a good idea to bother him. Definitely need to step up that service.
