I have never reviewed before but I feel that it is necessary to do so on this place.  This place was aweful.  Haircut was uneven and shorter than requested. When I brought it up, not even an apology...had to have then fix it but not even an offer of a discount or anything for the terrible job they did.  I will never go back there.

We had the best experience.  Dr Kwok was so nice.  My daughter was getting contacts for the first time and was extremely nervous.  This was our 2nd attempt at trying to get them within a year.   We tried another eye place first and didn't have any luck learning how to put them in, our daughter left frustrated and sad.  Dr. Kwok was so patient and she really put her at ease.  She worked with her until she was able to do them herself.  No rushing just positive encouragement.  We are so happy with the service of her and her staff.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We will definitely be going back there.
