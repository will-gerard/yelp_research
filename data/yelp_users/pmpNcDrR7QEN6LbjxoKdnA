My boyfriend and I decided to try something different and have a nice romantic dinner, we came in on a Tuesday night. However, at first greeting, the hostess was the RUDEST and most ARROGANT girl I've ever encountered. Now, I travel a lot for work and eat at many restaurants (all flavors, sizes, etc) and I have never been greeted the way we were (which was like trash). We walked up and she stared at us with a blank expression on her face, like we were bothering her while she was standing around not doing a thing, she still never greeted us. Finally after what felt like way too long, my boyfriend looks at her and says "two please". She asks if we have reservations, we say no, she proceeds to become even more annoyed, rolls her eyes and then grabs two menus (doing whatever she can to not make eye contact) and has someone lead us to our table. We were in SHOCK, this is supposed to be a 'classy' place. I'm a business professional in sales and so is my boyfriend. I couldnt believe that the first person to greet you at a restaurant happens to be the most unpleasant person. I'd rethink hiring someone with some better customer service skills and lack of attitude.   Now that I got that one out of the way...(which I still cant believe). Our waitress Talia was a GODSEND!!! She was pleasant, engaging, extremely attentive, went way out of her way and made our dining experience excellent. So thank you Talia for turning the night around...amazing service, great food, HORRBILE hostess, nice atmosphere.

Lindsey and her team are great! They really spend time to learn about your dog with you when you first start. She also gives some upfront advice and training right away, which is great to see immediate results! Totally reasonably priced, very friendly and extremely accommodating when you need to book a walk last minute! So glad I found her!!
