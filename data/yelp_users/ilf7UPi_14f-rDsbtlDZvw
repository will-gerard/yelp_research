Contrary to the other reviews, there was a crowd waiting at the door at noon. Despite this, we were seated promptly.   We initially chose this restaurant because of a coupon in the newspaper. We got 1/2 pound prime rib, a dozen shrimp and 2 sides (I chose the garden salad very crisp and garlic mash). The food was satisfactory, but wasn't worth any more than the coupon price. They have a great selection of draft beers (I had the Sam Adams Boston Lager). I would recommend this restaurant to my friends.

This place deserved a 2.5 star rating but that was not an option.  Despite the prior reviews, I was disappointed after eating here. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  We had egg rolls (which ended up being spring rolls), panang chicken and a shrimp dish. The shrimp were small Whig was overcompensated by the green beans. The curry dish was the best dish we had.

Food was acceptable but the prices, even for lunch, were a bit much (the total check was $90 for 2 people, and we only had 2 drinks each). I enjoyed the margaritas, however I learned later (not by my server) that they had a "mug" price of less than $5 each! If you're going for a casual atmosphere, excellent margaritas and an acceptable meal, this is the place.

This newly remodeled location is absolutely delightful. I just relocated to phoenix and was pleased to have Village Inns. Definitely beats IHop or Denny's hands down.

The food was okay, however the decor is quite outdated. I would have enjoyed it much more if the restaurant didn't smell dingy.

Besides having to get over the smell of fish each time I walk in, this location is excellent. They have great prices and it's a one stop shop for those hard to find ethnic grocery items. Not to mention they have a frequent shopper card that gives 10% off the total ticket price.

Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.

I have definitely experienced better. The service is VERY slow. After realizing the inside dining room was small and stuffy, I asked to sit outside. Despite the server only having 1 table with 2 people, it took 10 minutes for someone to locate me outside, and prior to that they didn't even offer us drinks. The dining experience outside was nice, however the service continued to be very slow.  Once we received the food (which we ordered medium hot), it was too spicy to eat. Instead of sending the food back, we got it in a to go box.  Only go here if you're willing to take 2 hours for a meal.

Pretty large casino and game room. Reminds me of Vegas. Excellent parking in garage. Lost money but still a good choice for alcohol and gaming.
