This place has an air of faded grandeur, like it used to be nice. Now the slip covers over the back of the chairs can't cover up the little shabby details. I didn't expect much, and that's what I got.  We ordered 5 appetizers: egg rolls, crab rangoons, fried shrimp, crispy quail, and chicken lettuce wraps. Food came out in stages, the first 3 arriving quickly, served with pots of sweet and sour, spicy mustard, and pepper flakes in oil. The pots were dirty. The egg rolls were overcooked but were otherwise pretty standard. The shrimp was cook right. The rangoons were also fine, as far as plain and uninspired rangoons go. The quail came out next, completely dry. But crispy, anyway. The chicken for the lettuce wraps had almost no flavor; you had to pour on plum sauce for it to taste like anything. The lettuce cups were full of water; I shook one off for a minute or 2 and it was still dripping on me.   Service is fast and friendly; prices are decent. Basically a totally average Chinese place.

Truth be told, we were so hungry when we got here that it scarcely mattered what we put into our mouths, but this is a great restaurant!   We were happy to sit outside; it was a bit chilly for me but it was so beautiful I didn't mind. Service was fast and friendly. We managed to find a fairly high protein, low carb option, and both ordered steak and eggs, which came out perfectly cooked to order. The steak was a lovely little piece of meat, excellently seasoned and plated. It came a with a surprising but beautifully complementary sauce, the name of which I forget, made of bell peppers, and some good fries. The fries were kind of cold, unfortunately, but I don't know if that's because of the ambient air temperature.  We had to ask for salt and pepper, which wasn't on the table.

Pretty solidly mediocre sushi. On a conveyor belt.  This was my first time eating revolving sushi. Pluses: no waiting for your food (in the beginning, anyway. After a while, you might be waiting for something you haven't tried yet to come around, or for a special request), sushi is REALLY inexpensive (we spent about half of what we'd typically spend on sushi). Minuses: average taste, sort of sad looking, not put together with very much care.   We enjoyed the Las Vegas roll the most and did not like the Hawaiian roll.   We were just passing through town and were hungry and the sushi counter at AJ's had already closed, so we were just glad to find something to eat. The place was slightly crowded and we had to wait for a seat at the bar (they didn't seem to be seating people at the tables) but we didn't wait long. Bigger parties had longer waits, and after we were seated it really filled up and people were lining the walls waiting for seats. We had to specifically request wasabi, because they forgot to bring us some. The sushi wasn't bad; it just wasn't excellent. I guess you never know how long it's been going around in circles.   We requested some eel, which was very sweet and very greasy and just sort of slapped on top of the rice. There just isn't a lot of attention to detail here.   There's something really unnatural about eating off a conveyor belt. I don't think the feeding process needs this kind of automation. The sign said "fine dining" but I'm afraid there's nothing fine about adding a labor-saving device more appropriate to a factory to ones meal.
