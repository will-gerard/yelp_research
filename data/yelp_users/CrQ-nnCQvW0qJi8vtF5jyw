I haven't been to Majerle's in maybe 15 years but went the other night with friends before the Rush concert (they were awesome, btw). Ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was splendid and refreshing. I also got the Gorilla Wings (bone-in wings), I'd been having a hankering for wings. Being gluten free, you can imagine my surprise when they brought them out, in all their breaded glory. OY! Nary a mention of the breading on the menu, who breads their chicken wings?! [The boneless wings specifically state they are breaded] The server politely asked me what else I'd like, while everyone around me was enjoying their food, and not wanting to make us late for the concert, I ordered some french fries. They brought them to me very quickly. They did not charge me for the wings and the manager did apologize to me.  Having said that, the other people I was with all ordered something that came with french fries, including one friend who ordered a burger. The server that brought the food (not our regular server) did not bring mustard or ketchup so we had to ask. A few minutes later, still no condiments but our regular server did stop by and we had to again ask for the condiments. What server doesn't automatically bring those condiments to a table full of people who will no doubt need them?! Seriously it's just common sense. I was not particularly enthused about my visit and, although a huge fan of Thunder Dan's, I will likely not stop in again anytime soon.

Went here last night with a group for a friend's birthday. Never been before but will definitely be back in the future. Service was on par. Food was incredibly insanely delicious. I had the Chilean Sea Bass. Real not fake like some other establishments. It was probably the best I've ever had. Ever. Enjoyed some Black Sambucca after the meal. It was a great evening with good friends!

I was invited to brunch with friends who are regulars. I've passed by this place a bunch of times. It's in a strip mall and doesn't look like much from the outside but when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was casual with a touch of elegance. Our server was Nina who was delightful and pleasant. I decided on an Arnold Palmer for a beverage although my peers were having bloody mary's and mimosas. I decided on the breakfast sandwich and asked that it be served on the gluten free hamburger bun. It was one of the tastiest breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. A couple friends had the "catch" of the day which I believe was salmon and they enjoyed it. I will absolutely be back.

I have been coming here about 7 months now and haven't had any issues with them. Staff is friendly and polite. I go every other week and my nails always look nice. I don't mind the cash only policy, certainly not a deal breaker.

Took a friend for a birthday dinner last week. I don't think there was anything to complain about really. The server, (Ian, I think) was wonderful. He was knowledgeable about wines as well as everything on the menu including the special of the day. One of the reasons I picked this place is because they have several gluten free items from which to choose. First, we had what I consider the best table in the place, right at the far southwest corner. Perfect view, wish we could have come at sunset, surely it would have been spectacular. We started off with red wine and pork belly for the appetizer. What I will share is that we thought we only ordered one, to share, but they brought us two, no worries, we enjoyed them. Then we had salads. My friend ordered the steak and I got the chicken, so we could try each others. Both were just fabulous. I was way too full for dessert but my friend made room for creme brulee which was very tasty. The entire meal was nicely done and enjoyable. The meal was not inexpensive, but you kind of know that going in, ours with tip was just over $200.

I'd been taking my car to the South Scottsdale location and was very pleased. So when I moved to North Phoenix last year I was happy to see a location close to my new residence. And even happier that Jason was now managing this location after he left the South Scottsdale location awhile back. It was like seeing an old friend again! I trust Jason and his crew and know that they will take good care of my car. I can rely on his honesty and assessment of the car's needs. I will always take my car here and highly recommend this place for service. Jason will treat you right!

I emailed the store manager, Jason, last week to schedule an oil change and realized today that I hadn't heard back from him. I called the store to make the appointment and spoke to Kevin who told me that Jason passed away recently. I am truly sad and send my condolences to the entire Advanced family :(

I needed to get a necklace fixed and looked them up online. The reviews were good and they are close to home. I walked in as they opened last Saturday and asked them to fix my necklace. I was greeted immediately and warmly. My necklace was fixed within just a few minutes. The fee was very reasonable. Now THAT is service!  Because of the wonderful customer service and the reasonable fee, I will most certainly do business with them again. I would definitely recommend them.

I've been taking my dry cleaning here for about 15 months, since moving to the north valley. Always get great service and a fair price. I've never had any issues with my clothes and they are always ready when promised. I would recommend them to anyone. They do accept credit and debit cards, there is a small fee for doing so, I think 75 cents.

I don't really enjoy writing bad reviews but certain occasions prompt such a review.  Let me preface by stating my roommate has ordered from this location maybe 3 times a month for the past 5 years, and typically has a good experience. I have been ordering from this location for maybe a year or so and always get the gluten free pizza. Well I guess we've never ordered on a rainy-ish Friday night because our pizzas took well over an hour to arrive, which was stated when we ordered on our iPhone app. When they arrived, the driver neglected to bring us our Pepsi. Wish I would have realized it before I left him a very generous tip. But as soon as I did, I ran down the driveway after him (in my jammies no less) and he said he'd bring it right back. We live about 1 mile from the store. We were starving so dug right in but were very disappointed because the pizzas were cold. I mean not even warm, at all, simply downright cold. We only had a couple pieces and decided we were over it when the Pepsi arrived. I briefly talked to the driver about our displeasure and he said to call the manager. I did. I talked to Alexander who, when I asked to speak to a manager, asked why. I gave him the sitch. I was on a brief hold when Alexander came back and said all the managers were too busy to talk to me. Okay I get it, it's a busy Friday night and maybe they're short staffed or whatever, but you should never be too busy to talk to a customer who is unhappy. And who orders frequently. I mean, I just spent $30 on 2 cold and, quite frankly, not very delicious pizzas, and you can't come to the phone and offer to make things right? Really. I told Alexander exactly how I felt about this, stated that I would be Yelping and ended the call.  I have ordered from other locations in the past and managers usually acknowledge when they've made mistakes and customers are unhappy. It's rare that I've been unhappy with this chain in the past, but when I have been, they've always been willing to make it up to me. This location was clearly not interested in making things right and is hugely disappointing. And because of that mistake I will no longer order from this location. I am happy to go to another pizza establishment that caters to customers and quite frankly has better pizza. Pizza Hut, if you're reading this you really should be make sure your managers know how important customer retention is.

I went here for the first time on Sunday. I got the gluten free pizza and it was absolutely the best GF crust I've tasted. They get it from the Gluten Free Creations Bakery which is local. It is seasoned with rosemary and so delicious! Prices were reasonable, staff was very friendly and I would certainly recommend it and will definitely become a regular customer.

This small establishment has become my favorite Thai place in north Phoenix. Food is always wonderful and quick. Service is good as well. Prices are very reasonable. Larb is my favorite appetizer and the curries are quite delicious. I would recommend ordering medium level of spice. The Thai Ice Tea with cream is yummy too.

First time here the other day, was out running errands and decided to stop in here and give it a try. The place is fairly small and it was packed, we did have to wait a short time for a table, not more than 5 minutes. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, offered to bring us tea while we waited for our table. I was pleasantly surprised there were many Gluten Free items to choose from. I ordered the Sleepy Gyro Salad and my friend ordered the Chicken Schwarma Pita. We both really enjoyed our lunches. As busy as they were the service did not suffer. And our order came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. It didn't let up the entire time we were there either. Our server was nice and attentive. I do want to mention that the small Sleepy Gyro Salad was huge and I had the leftovers for lunch the following day so I would only recommend the larger size if you have an appetite to match. My friend's pita came with fries that I had to taste being a fry fanatic, and they were pretty decent, sprinkled with feta cheese. Mmm cheese. Yeah. I will definitely return.

Been here a few times, chips and salsa are free, plentiful and pretty good, they serve both a hot and mild salsa. I've had several items on the menu and all are tasty for your standard Mexican American fare. Great margs too! Service is usually very good, rarely have to wait for a table.

Steven did my massage a few weeks ago and he was superb!  I would highly recommend him to anyone. He could tell I wasn't in the mood to chat and commenced massaging. I felt a world better afterwards. I hope to return again in the near future.

I was a customer of this particular location from the early 90s up until about 5 years ago. I quit going because of the deplorable customer service and attitude from several of the staff. The customer service just deteriorated year after year and I finally had enough. But about a year and a half ago I got a discount offer in the mail from them and decided to give them another try. I was pleasantly surprised. I went for an eye exam and the customer service was an improvement. The glasses and contacts were a painless process this time around. When I went back for a yearly exam a few months ago, I didn't have any issues with them.  I hope the good customer service continues.

I have been shopping here for maybe 16 years and I have always received good customer service. The entire staff here is extremely helpful and knows their stuff. For such a small store, they make good use of every inch. Selections of supplements, vitamins, and specialty foods are really good. If you ever have a question about anything to do with nutrition, this is your one stop shop. The radio shows are pretty interesting as well, I particularly enjoy listening to Bob from Olympian Labs.

I love that they now offer GF buns! Their grilled dogs and brats are the BEST in Phoenix by far.  Love stopping here whenever I'm in Tempe. Cannot get grilled dogs like this anywhere else in the Valley, wish you had more locations. A dog just tastes better when grilled. For me the darker the better. Just a couple words of advice to the workers- use a knife to cut the GF hot dog buns instead of trying to use your gloved fingers, you'll have better results. Also just change gloves before handling my GF bun without asking me if I want you to :) I think most GF peeps would agree with me on this.

I have been to this restaurant twice in the past few months, both experiences were the same, so here's my assessment. My most recent visit was a busy Saturday morning, we waited maybe 10 minutes for a table, so not too bad. The menu is not gluten friendly but I did order the American - two eggs, bacon and country potatoes, along with coffee. They also have an omelette that comes with the potatoes as well. The bacon was delicious and the potatoes were decent. But I ordered my eggs over medium, and they came out over easy, too runny for me. I would have said something to our server but she didn't come back to check on us at all, and when she finally did come back she slapped the check on the table and said she'd be our cashier when we were ready and then bolted to the next table. I had some serious server-envy as I looked around at other tables who had fun, friendly servers. Servers that were polite, smiling, brought them coffee refills and asked how their food was. Alas, our server was busy chatting it up with the old biker men at the next table and all but ignored us. Had I been paying the check I wouldn't have been as generous as my boyfriend was who always leaves 20%.  Before we left, my boyfriend got their Jack Daniels pecan pie to bring to a function that evening and it got rave reviews. Since I am GF I'll take their word for it. I did purchase some Hoppin' Frog jelly (basically raspberry and jalapeno) and had it on some toast at breakfast this morning. I will say it's pretty good. But this place overall does not garner rave reviews from yours truly.

I ate dinner here with coworkers after work last night.  I was impressed that they have a gluten free menu, and it was not as sparse as many restaurants, it offered a decent selection. I opted for the bacon wrapped shrimp fajitas. Our food came in out pretty quickly. My meal came with all the usual fajita makings (sour cream, shredded cheese, guac, lettuce), plus a cilantro lime rice and a side of charro beans. I chose the romaine leaves for my fajitas, in an attempt to be healthy, but the corn tortillas would have been a far better choice to hold the jumbo shrimp and all the fajita makings. My bad. The beans and rice were average in my opinion, however, the shrimp was wonderfully done, very tasty.  Our server (Sarah?) was on the ball and our table of 5 kept her on her toes. She did not disappoint. My work peers also enjoyed their meals, which included a chocolate molten cake and a cheesecake. I think the only GF option for dessert would be the flan but I was already pretty overloaded with dairy and quite full so refrained but would like to try it next time I'm there. And I do hope there is a next time!

I've been here several times, mostly with coworkers on our lunch break. Chips and salsa are really good. Today I had the carnitas lunch special and had them sub corn tortillas for flour, with no problem, and it was really tasty. Another coworker got the fajitas which she really enjoyed. Our server today was John and he was on the ball!

I have been going here for about 9 months and I enjoy getting a pedi here. Staff is always really nice, never push to upsell, and do a great job. I typically don't have to wait long, if at all, if I walk in without an appt. I have never felt rushed here, even when they're busy.  The place is always clean and the prices are very reasonable. I don't mind paying cash for tips. You can use a credit or debit card, just not for tipping. I would definitely recommend Julie's Nails.

A friend was itching for some Italian food last weekend and wanted to try some place different so we looked on Yelp and saw the good reviews for this place. They offer gluten free pasta so I was game. I ordered the Tuscan pasta dish with spinach, artichokes and feta cheese, along the GF noodles. It didn't taste like there was any sauce on it, just the veggies and cheese. I added pepper and salt, but it was still a bit lacking. My friend got their spaghetti with meatballs and an order of garlic bread. I have to say that it was disappointing to me that, like so many other restaurants that offer a GF pasta noodle, they did not go the extra mile to offer a gluten free garlic bread is beyond me. Garlic bread and pasta go together like Forrest and Jenny! Aaand no GF dessert either.  This is why they garner 2 stars and a big Meh from me.

Truly Nolen services us quarterly. A few months ago we had ants in our kitchen. We told our technician, Michael Eckstein, and he brought in a couple of bait containers for the problem area. He told us they'd be gone within a week but they actually disappeared within 2 days. We were really pleased. Michael also came out again this past week, I completely spaced that he was coming and stopped off at the grocery store before heading home. He waited for me, maybe 40 minutes, and didn't complain about it one bit when I finally showed up. He was courteous and professional and finished the back of the house, where he couldn't get in without me because our gate was locked. He is knowledgeable and helpful. Michael is an asset to the company and we are glad to have Truly Nolen help us with our pest control needs.

I've been here a few times and the food is always right on the money. The blue corn enchiladas are my favorites. The margaritas are always good. The service is pretty good too. I enjoy sitting outside when weather permits. Great little place to bring out of town visitors too, especially if they like spice!

I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it on 'Check Please Arizona' (PBS) a few months ago. I finally got to go for my birthday last night and was not disappointed. First of all, I love that they have a gluten free menu and not just one or two items, on the contrary there are quite a few GF menu items to order. If you are GF, please let your server know right away and they will bring out freshly baked GF bread for you. It was just scrumptious! The butter melted on it and was so yummy.  Our server was really on point. I wish I could remember her name, she was very attentive without hovering over us. The busboys were always making sure our waters were filled. The ambiance was really great. The interior dining area is picturesque, Old West-ish but cozy, warm and yet classy. I started off with a Pinot Noir and the Tonto House Salad . The salad was wonderful and the size was perfect(appetizer size). My friend got a Merlot and the Caesar salad. For my entree I selected the Ancho Chili-Rubbed Filet. Oh. My. Word. Probably one of THE best steaks I have ever had. Medium rare done to perfection. The presentation was quite lovely. My yfriend got the Mesquite Wood-Grilled Venison Tenderloin Medallions. Had a bite of that and it was just divine. Save room for dessert because you will be sad if you don't. I got the GF/vegan Chocolate Cake, it was served with raspberries, a raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. My friend got the creme brulee. SO good. Seriously, we were in a food coma by the time we hobbled out to the car. The sun was setting and naturally it was another gorgeous Arizona sunset, a perfect ending to one of the best meals I have ever had.

I've probably been coming here for over 20 years, first time was with my Dad years ago. The food is always very good. Back in the day before gluten became an issue, I used to enjoy the fried chicken. Boy how I miss that chicken! But alas, sometimes with age comes digestive issues. I still enjoy the BBQ, often get the pork or beef sandwiches, just without the bread, the fries are good and the slaw is just right, not too sweet, not too vinegary (is that a word?)  It's always fun to sit outside on the patio on a beautiful day. Sometimes they have musicians play outside and that's always a treat. Service is always good. This place is a definitely must if you have out of town visitors! The whole town of Cave Creek is kind of a throw back, really neat.

Stayed here for my 50th birthday this past summer, loved it! We had no issues with an early check in, but we stayed Sunday through Wednesday, so not sure how it is on a Friday or Saturday. The interior is pretty cool, imo. The staff was friendly, the rooms were nice, the pool was fun, the restaurants were all great, especially the breakfast buffet. The first night we ate at the burger joint and we each had a shake that has alcohol in it, fabulous, although I will say Vegas is not exactly as cheap as it once was, the bill for 2 burgers, 2 fries and the 2 shakes was just over a Grant$$. Hotels is in a good location and convenient to lot of things to do on the Strip. I enjoyed this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.

We wanted to eat dinner before heading to the Blue Man Group at the Monte Carlo and happened upon this place, right as they were opening, 5:30pm. What a wonderful dining experience. I am gluten free and the Chef baked some delicious GF rolls for me - the server said if you call in advance, they can have them ready for you when you get there. The Chef even prepared some Foix Gras for us, on the house, while we were waiting for the Carpaccio we had ordered as a starter. Both were quite good. I ordered rabbit which was just divine. My companion had the steak, which he said was one of the best he's ever eaten. We both had red wine with dinner. The overall experience far exceeded our expectations and we will absolutely return when we travel back to Vegas.

What a wonderful dining experience! Service was very attentive, we wanted for nothing. Steak was insanely awesome, the Truffle Fries were pure bliss, and the champagne made for a unique albeit slightly giddy lunch :) If you want to impress someone, this is definitely a great place to do it!

By far one of the best shows I've seen in Vegas! Fun fun fun and not a dull moment. 90 minutes of pure enjoyment and laughter. Plus they stick around after the show for picture taking, which I did. Very fun night!

I like coming here for dinner. Been here three times and it's always absolutely delicious. I've had the bbq chicken, brisket, sausage and the ribs. They're always wonderful. The service is attentive.  I cannot eat gluten so I forego the cornbread and the rolls but I am told they are quite good. I also have never been able to try any of their desserts due to my intolerance.  I really do enjoy their bbq, the sauces are really good. I just wish they offered a couple of GF items, that's why the 4-stars instead of 5.

I went to dinner here about a month ago with several ladies from work. It was one lady's birthday and she likes this place so it was her choice. Our server was pleasant enough and attentive. Our food was pretty good overall. But I feel I have to share what transpired during our visit because it completely blew me away, even as a former restaurant manager.  When our food came out, they apparently skipped the birthday girl but said it was coming right out. She ordered fish, which doesn't typically take long to prepare. I noticed while we were eating that the manager was stopping at other tables to chat but he avoided us. About 5-10 minutes later, I got up and went to find the server to ask what was taking so long. Couldn't find her but did speak with another server. Apparently this got the manager's attention and he came right over. He said he was told by the server that the birthday girl had arrived and ordered late, by manner of explanation. When we told him that wasn't the case, he told us that the server had lied to him. I could hardly believe it. It was completely unprofessional to malign a staff member in this regard. You just don't throw a crew member under the bus that way. You hold yourself accountable. Anyway, he said he would comp the fish meal, offered a lame apology and excused himself. By the time the fish dinner arrived several minutes later, the rest of us were finished with our meals. It was disappointing especially since it was her birthday. Several ladies ordered dessert, and after they arrived, the manager showed up with a huge towering plate of some kind of dessert and said it was on the house. Had we known he was going to do that, no one would have ordered dessert because that would have fed everyone at our table, about 10 of us. So most of that went to waste. While I thought my meal was very delicious and satisfying, I would likely not return due to the manager's actions and what he said about our server, I just can't get past that.

I have been here 3-4 times and always enjoy it. Although I cannot enjoy the many schnitzel's (breaded and therefore not gluten free) my bf says they are wonderful. I myself usually get one of the many bratwursts they offer and have always been pleased. The German fried potatoes and the sauerkraut are outstanding! I usually start off with a Gewurztraminer wine and my bf usually gets a German beer. On a recent Saturday evening visit, a German 2-man band was playing to add to the ambiance. Our server was attentive but didn't hover. Always an enjoyable time here.

My friend was really itching to try this place and even though it's not "gluten friendly" per se, they did offer a couple of salad items that would work for me. When we got there it was really dark inside, almost like a throw back 70s lounge feel, especially with the music they played. We were told to sit anywhere. Our server was Sarah who was absolutely wonderful. She was really on the ball, a great server, and anticipated our needs in advance. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, my friend got the Porky pasty. Our food came in a rather timely fashion despite it being a very busy Friday dinner rush. I enjoyed the salad, the portion was huge. The chicken was tasty and there was plenty of tomatoes, cukes and dressing (on the side). My friend really enjoyed the Porky and even took some home, as it was quite a lot. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of this place when we first walked in. The darkness really didn't convey fun and friendly but the service was great and so was the food so it more than made up for the initial shock I felt upon arriving. Sarah, keep being awesome, all servers could take a lesson from this gal.

I booked our company holiday party here this past December and our catering manager Tracy Fox was wonderful to work with. We had a section of the A Pointe in Tyme restaurant all to ourselves. There was a fireplace and a nice patio off to the side. The place was nicely decorated for the season. We really kept the cocktail servers hoppin ;)  The entire staff that took care of us really made sure we had a great party. The food was delicious and everyone enjoyed the meal. A few of us, including myself, opted to book a room in advance, so no worries of calling Uber or a taxi for a ride home that night. The room was small but cozy and had a decent patio view. Overall it was a delightful experience and I hope we can have our party there next December.

I hired them for my move after seeing the great Yelp reviews. They were prompt to arrive, protective of my possessions, and didn't dawdle. The two men that moved me were personable and helped alleviate some of the stress that comes with moving. The cost was very competitive.  Jim was always very communicative even when I had to change my move date (a couple weeks out).

I would give them a zero stars if allowed. I have been to this particular location only a handful of times. Last time I was here they gave me the regular, gluten-laden Spicy Chicken by mistake which was easily remedied since I was there physically. The manager apologized profusely and made me a new meal quickly. Today the girls from my office placed an order of maybe 4 meals including mine which was GF. They brought the lunch back to the office as we only have a limited time to eat. When I discovered my chicken was breaded I called and spoke to the manager who was rather rude and copped a tude with me. Additionally he offered no apology whatsoever. He went on to say he personally bagged my order asking how I could tell the order was not GF. [Really? How does a manager not know this?!]  He offered only a refund of my money. After he processed my credit he immediately hung up. So I guess I get to be hangry the rest of the day lol. At least it's Friday right?!  Very. Poor. Customer service. Not to mention lack of food knowledge of the restaurant he manages is a real shame. Shows he has not been adequately trained and doesn't give a hoot about the GF issue or customers. The manager SHOULD have taken this as a learning experience and educated himself and his staff but sadly, he chose not to. Hangry Donna will not be back to any Pei Wei's in the future and wrote this Yelp review instead. Hangry Donna's coworkers are staying clear of her this afternoon. Chang's should hang their head in shame.

Looking for someplace new to try. Was not disappointed. Just got some hard shell tacos with refried beans and rice along with some tasty Horchata. The tacos were really good and the salsa was so delicious. Just the right amount of spice. Will definitely be back!

I have been coming here for almost a year, the food and service is really good every time.  Brunch is great. I typically get the soup and salad, the pumpkin soup is really delicious! Sometimes I get the fried egg sandwich, no bread (I'm GF), but I am told their breads are really wonderful.  For dinner let me suggest the Baked Goat Cheese. Since I can't have bread, I ask for cucumber slices to have with. So good! I have had their French Onion Burger (no bread, no fried onions - sub pickled onions instead) and it is every bit as good as the name implies. Their fries are also really good and I consider myself a fry aficionado. The chicken salad is also really yummy. I would also highly recommend the Big Pig, it's like a French Dip but with pork and gruyere cheese, pure awesomeness! For happy hour, the Cucumber Cooler and Santa Rosa are my recommendations. The only reason I give them a 4 instead of a 5 is the gluten-free factor. But I do enjoy the food I can have and will keep coming back.

I love coming here with our dog (he loves to socialize and eat the doggy biscuits at the far west end of the market). I love the variety of produce, cheeses and garden plants. I have even bought some gluten free items here and loved them. My favorite is the guy that sells the homemade pork green chile. It probably costs about $12 but I usually get 4 meals out of it for myself so I consider it a bargain and it's just delicious. The goat cheese guy is great too.

I have been here twice for dinner recently and the food is insanely delicious. They start you off at dinner with Papadom, these wafers that are simple yet tasty. They have an onion appetizer, onion Bhaji, that is deep fried with garbanzo flour, which is gluten free, and it was almost like eating onion rings, something I really miss being GF. The onions have a wonderful flavor. The Chicken Tikka Masala has to be my favorite dish but the Lamb Vindaloo is a close second. I went there for lunch the other day since I work close by and it was a buffet with a good variety of dishes. There was also a hot chai tea that was very flavorful and spicy plus a rice dessert that was pretty yummy. The buffet was just under $10, a very reasonable price for a buffet.The service is attentive, the food comes out pretty quickly and it's a good experience all around. This place gets two thumbs up in my opinion.

I have been to Chang's more times than I can count, several locations. On a recent visit for dinner with coworkers, I have to say I was really impressed with the service we received. The server was really incredible, and we kept her hoppin'. They have a good variety of GF items. I got the Lemon Chicken, my usual. I saved room for dessert and got the flourless chocolate cake. It's almost not a cake, more like a heavy mousse or something, it was phenomenal. I don't throw that word out there often, but that was one divine dessert, even for anyone who does not need to eat gluten free. The place was packed and hoppin' for the two or so hours we were there. I can't wait to go back!

Went for happy hour recently with friends, we had a table of 6, our server was awesome and very attentive. We didn't want for anything and pretty much kept her on her toes all evening but she rose to the occasion. I had a Chambord Margarita. Actually there was more than one. We had several appetizers, including the tableside guacamole. While it was good, I have never had cotilla cheese on my guac before, so I think I would leave that off in the future. We also had the Green Chile Pork nachos and we all enjoyed those. The queso was tasty but I later realized it likely had flour in it (as a thickening agent) so my bad for not asking about that in advance (I'm gluten intolerant). A friend who is also GF got the Street Tacos and enjoyed them. And another friend got the Flat Top Grilled Quesadillas and she really liked them too. We'll be back!

I really never have any issues with this place, I like coming here for lunch during the workday because they have a decent gluten free selection. When my Arnold Palmer is half drank, they bring me another one without me even asking, which is nice, as this time of year, ones thirst tends to be enormous. I typically get the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli, it's always delicious. The egg drop soup is really yummy and a good starter while waiting for your entree. I do think it's odd though that after ordering GF, they still bring you a fortune cookie, which is not GF lol :) No lost points for it though.

Went for a friend's birthday and everything was wonderful! Started off with drinks, I had the Peartini ,which was delish, and my friend had the AG Mule, which he enjoyed very much. We skipped appetizers and salads and ordered filets with the cognac pepper corn sauce. Since the sides are ala carte and enough for 2-3 people, we shared the green beans and the AG mashed potatoes, both were very delicious. The steaks were so good and the sauce was a great complement. For my friend's birthday they brought out their house butter cake topped with a dash of ice cream on a plate that spelled out Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce, needless to say it was quite good! The service was impeccable and we will be back!

I've been a huge fan of TJ's for about 18 years. My only complaint is that there isn't more of them! This location is closest to me and it's about 10 miles away, so I probably only go a couple times a month. It's right by Whole Paycheck and Penzey's Spices. They offer quite a few Gluten Free items that I like, including the GF cupcakes that are reasonably priced at 4 for $3.99. Always moist and delicious. Plus the wine selection is pretty decent. They had a wine tasting a few months ago that turned me onto a nifty little red wine called Tribunal. It's become my favorite wine and it's only $10, makes a great gift and I've turned a few friends on to it. The Hatch Green Chile salsa is one of my favorite things to buy here.  You can use it as plain old salsa, but it's great in any New Mexican type dish or recipe. Also the Gluten Free chocolate chip cookies are a MUST when I visit. Even non GF eaters think these cookies are the bomb. And they are. What else is there to say about Trader Joe's?

I first heard about them at the Roadrunner Park Farmer's Market (on Cactus near the 51), a while back. I tried a sample, as they are gluten free, not many things are at the market. They were delicious! Ended up purchasing quite a few, including some pumpkin dessert tamales, which were really good as well. They come in a 2-pack and what I really like is the convenience of a tamale. They heat up quickly and are great for a fast dinner or to take to work for a quick lunch on a busy day. Add some tortilla chips, maybe a little salsa and/or guacamole and boom, instant meal. YUM-O award!

Gary was my massage therapist recently, my first visit to this location. I had a Groupon and wanted to give them a try, being new to the area. I had just moved a few days prior so booked the massage well in advance, knowing I would be in need. Gary did a decent job, wasn't too hard and wasn't too soft. He was able to undo some of the damage that moving caused. I scheduled a few more visits, as part of a great membership offer, and hope that future visits will yield similar results.

I have been here on many occasions but went the other night for dinner and cocktails with a friend, who is also GF. This was my first visit since they revamped the menu. I liked their menu before but was really impressed with the new items. Almost everything on the menu is GF. My friend and I both got the Cucumber Basil Breeze drink, it's made with organic vodka, I didn't even know booze could be organic, my first organic buzz HA. For appetizers we got the Baked Brie & Roasted Garlic - SO yummy!  For our entree we each had the Baked Spinach Ricotta Cannelloni, delish! The flatbread that comes with is pretty decent. For dessert, my friend and I split the Eva's Organic Apple Cobbler and the Classic Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie, we both opted for the Coconut ice cream on top of each - to die for! I don't even want to know how many calories I consumed that night but the food was really really good. Nice to be able to eat "real" food, as being GF, you're somewhat limited when you go out to eat, but this place gets my 5-star rating and repeat visits.

I had a coupon for this place and thought I'd give it a try on a recent lunch break from work. When I walked in, it was as another reviewer mentioned, filled with odd trinkets and little girl dresses for sale, which I found strange but not a turn off. And as a yet another reviewer shared, the woman who was at the front only asked me how many (it was just me), grabbed a menu and didn't utter another word as she walked me to my table. If that's their first impression, they need to improve it ASAP. She was not friendly whatsoever. No smile, no "how are you today?", zilch, zip, nada. Fortunately, the server was friendlier. I ordered a pink lemonade and looked over the menu. I inquired about the Lemon Herb Chicken to make sure it wasn't breaded (the whole GF thing), and he assured me it was not. It came with a side so I chose the mashed potatoes. The meal came in a reasonable time. The chicken was lukewarm and not hot, like it had been sitting under a warmer or something. It didn't taste bad, just not freshly made. And it was served with a lemon slice on top, but the chicken itself did not taste lemony, only herby. The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes and while not bad, had a ton of green stuff in it, parsley maybe, too much IMO. My overall experience is what prompts the two star rating. The lady at the front should be warm and welcoming. The meal should taste fresh and not pre-made and maybe cut back a bit on the parsley, or whatever, in the mashed potatoes. I will likely not return.

I always enjoy eating here. The rice noodle dishes are gluten free and healthy. Plus the portions are big so you have leftovers for lunch the next day! Pho is tasty as well. Service is typically good and food is served promptly. Prices are quite reasonable. The Thai iced teas are so yum-o!

I had a LivingSocial coupon and Kate was my massage therapist. I have had several massages before this one and I know a good therapist. She took one look at my occupation on the form I filled out and insisted on massaging only my "bum" as she put it (she was not even English). I told her that I held stress in my upper shoulders, back and neck, but she insisted she knew best and that sitting at my desk all day, the only area she should focus on was my bum. She kept telling me to breath, to concentrate only on my breathing, like Lamaze. At one point, she told me to relax my vag muscles (??) and my rectum muscles (??) which, I'm sorry but that was just too weird, it only made me tense up more and now I need a real massage to recover from that massage. She didn't massage any other area as I had requested. I am more stressed now than I was before that massage. I will not return.

While having my car serviced nearby, thought I'd get a pedicure here while I waited. I was taken back right away which was surprising because the place was jam packed. After I quickly looked over the "menu" of services decided on the standard pedi which was 20. The next level up was 35 and that's more than I typically spend on a pedi unless I want flowers or something special done. When the lady started the water, she told me that the pedicure was 35, I told her no, I wanted the standard pedi. She was clearly unhappy but began working. I felt she rushed through the pedi which normally takes at least 45 minutes for a good job, but she was finished in about 1/2 hour. Upon completion, I was given an invoice and ushered up front to pay immediately, no time to dry, no thank you, nothing. Although it was quite a busy Saturday, I do not like being rushed and certainly did not feel like I was a valued customer.

Impossible to see the whole thing in one trip, have only seen maybe 1/3 and cannot wait to go back! Loved all the different bagpipes, had no idea they had them in countries other than Scotland! Really cool experience!

The fact alone that they now offer 4 gluten free desserts would make me a fan but the food and the service is always spectacular. Went last night before the Toto/Yes concert (both were awesome) and stayed overnight. My only disappointment was the lamb, which was not up to snuff last night as in the past when it simply melted in your mouth and was oh-so flavorful. Aside from that the sirloin steak was great, the shrimp cocktail, the oysters were delish. Last night they had crab legs and that was quite popular. I don't do crab because it's SO MUCH EFFORT for such little meat, lol, imo. There are many things that someone with food restrictions can have. Also if you step up and ask, the chef will either make some things for you and/or guide you to what you can safely eat.  Wednesday night is Prime Rib night and that's always good too.

Did a mini staycation here last night after the Toto/Yes concert. Good thing too because both bands played for 90 minutes each and it would have been tiring to drive home that late at night. The room was divine, very posh. I loved the shower the most, the shower head was directly above you, never had such a great shower! I will say though, that if you are attending a concert here, poolside like we did last night, the seats are so close together, everyone is really on top of one another. You're squished in like sardines in a can. And the seats are NOT comfortable at all. Good things the bands sang stand-worthy songs for a break from sitting lol!! All in all a good experience at the resort.

I had been a customer of the Mesa location for 20+ years but after moving to the north valley last year, the PV location is the closest location for me. I had actually called them several months ago to ask if they took my vision insurance but was told no. So since I have a membership at ABCE, I went ahead and scheduled an eye exam anyway because I knew I needed a new prescription. Now you'd think that someone who's been wearing glasses for over 40 years would be well seasoned at selecting frames that compliment her face, but sadly, that is not the case, which is why a visit is akin to a dental visit in my book. Anyway, once I arrived, I was greeted warmly and promptly. I don't recall the gal that greeted me but her hair was super cute and she was wearing of pair of trendy glasses that looked really nice on her.  I didn't have to wait very long and was taken back for the exam. Once the exam was over, I was greeted by Mat who asked if he could help me select frames. He then asked if I had vision insurance and told me that they do accept my plan, although they are out of network. After selecting 2 frames that he and another staff member liked on me, he did the pricing and also gave me the pricing for my contact lenses. I was blown away at how much money my vision plan saved me, along with my membership discounts. Mat was very accommodating, helpful, easy going and overall really made my day! If everyone in a customer service position could take a lesson from Mat and the other staff members, we would all be better off. I couldn't have been more pleased with my visit.

I went to get my new glasses this past weekend and was just as thrilled with this weekend's visit. Sue at the front desk greeted me right away and pleasantly. Both Daniel and Mat were very helpful. You can tell that they really want you to be happy with your contacts and eyeglasses. Sadly, I ended up bringing back a pair of glasses I ordered, they weren't entirely comfortable and I felt they looked a bit clunky on me. I brought them back, no questions asked, and ordered another pair. I am very pleased with the new glasses and I couldn't be happier. My experience with everyone at this location has been stellar.

My husband and I went a few weeks ago and saw Rich Vos. He was really funny as were the other comedians ahead of him, including Howard Hughes, who is incidentally the owner. We were looking to have a good time and we were not disappointed! Drinks were served very timely by an attentive staff. Everyone around us had a great time too. We'll be back!

I was here once several months ago and wasn't impressed with the look of it, but was pretty happy with my meal. I believe I had gotten the gyro (sans pita). Went the other day and was pleasantly surprised with the remodel, a huge improvement. I got the gyro again and it came with some yummy white and yellow (saffron?) rice that I really enjoyed. The service was good, the food was delivered very timely, and my friend and I did enjoy our food. I will definitely be back!

On a recent visit with friends, I had the Grilled Boneless Rainbow Trout with baby carrots and crushed roasted potatoes. SO GOOD, haven't had rainbow trout like this in years. The service was great and attentive. Drink was refilled before I had to ask. My friends had the Maui Tuna Crunch and the Oak-Grilled Filet Mignon, both of which were enjoyed. This would be a great place to take someone you want to impress.

I went for Sunday brunch with two friends. I had the GF Eggs Benedict and really enjoyed it. The sweet potato tots were really good. I loved that they offered so many GF options, as I am gluten intolerant. One friend had the Monte Cristo and said that it was too much bread, not enough filling, and felt the raspberry jam should have been served on the side. My other friend enjoyed her eggs and potatoes. The coffee was really good and I was impressed that they serve stevia and not aspartame. We waited about 5 minutes for a table at about 10 am and it was quite busy. Food came out timely and our server was attentive. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance and would go back again. My friend with the Monte Cristo would go again and try something different.

An enjoyable evening last night with Tone Bell. Loved the unplanned bit he did at the end with one of the other comedians, super funny. The club is huge and much nicer than some others. I'm pretty sure they weren't expecting the crowd that showed up last night as food took a long time to arrive. My wings were cold but otherwise tasty which is why they garnered 4 stars instead of 5. Drinks arrived very timely and our server was reasonably attentive given the crowd. I will definitely go back.

I had never been here before today. Had the special w/o the beer battered rye bread (since I am GF) - the burger was topped with havarti and pastrami brulee and a Brussel sprout slaw. It was topped with a jalapeño aioli. Really good. Had the seasoned fries which were just okay. My friend had the Country Burger and he enjoyed it. He had the sweet potato tots and I wasn't sure if they were breaded but I did try one and loved it. Overall I would definitely go back.

I've been a Penzey's fan for about 5 years and absolutely love their spices. If you could only see my spice racks, chock full of Penzey's spices! Since I've been shopping at Penzey's I have discovered so many new spices, it's really helped me evolve as a cook/baker. I love that they have recipes throughout the store and also in their catalogs, which usually have great coupons usually for something free or a BOGO. Additionally, the customer service is always stellar. I always leave Penzeys ready to whip up a batch of something yummy! Their gift boxes make wonderful birthday or holiday treat for that special baker or cook in your life!

I've been here a few times before with my boss and the bbq is pretty decent. When I went in today though it was clear things have declined. I got the pulled pork and french fries, which is what I normally get here. The pork was cold and not as tasty as it has been in the past. The french fries were really awful, like little lead sticks, I didn't even finish them. Maybe it was just a bad day but there is room for improvement.

My first visit was earlier this week and I have to say it was pretty good, very reasonably priced too. I got the platter with gyro meat and it was honestly more food than I could eat, but I had leftovers for the next day, which was nice. The platter comes with choice of meat, pitas (which I opted to forego being GF) tomatoes and red onions, along with a salad and fries. The salad was kind of a typical Greek type salad, greens with a couple of cucumber slices, kalamata olives, tomatoes, couple peppers, red onion, a dabble of cheese with a vinegar based dressing. The meat was really delish as was the Tzatziki sauce. The fries were fresh and tasty. Overall, it was a good value for the money. It's also a short drive from work so I think I will include it in my regular lunch-time rotation.

Went there for the first time recently, with a carnivore, but we both truly enjoyed the buffet, which was vegetarian. The selection was good and the food was very tasty. The Dosas were really fabulous and I really liked the tea! There was a lentil dish I really enjoyed, I don't recall what it was called (I'm new to Indian cuisine.) I am looking forward to going again.

I have been coming to this particular location for about a year and at first the food and service was wonderful! However recent visits have left me dissatisfied and wondering why I bother anymore. On the last few visits, including today's, I noticed the fries are are very greasy and not hot, this is likely due to the oil not being hot enough when the fries were put in. The burgers are okay but not fabulous. I order the burgers without bread because I am GF and the Udi's GF buns they serve are, well, just gross. The servers never think to bring me a knife, I always have to ask, use some common sense here people. Shame because I have been to other locations and the food and service is great.

I went back after being contacted by Smashburger, and overall it was a much better experience. Obviously Smashburger takes feedback and constructive criticism seriously. When I went back a week ago, the fries were really hot and not at all oily as in my previous few trips. The burger was juicy and delicious and when I ordered it without bread (I'm GF), I didn't have to ask for silverware. I'm really happy things have gotten better here!

I've been here a few times but haven't been back for awhile mostly due to, well, life and things happen ya know? I got an email from them recently about a promo they were running and I decided to treat myself. Andrea did a marvelous job working out the stress in my back, glutes, arms and neck. I have a new job and sit most of the day (very unhappily so) and am way more out of shape than I realized. I would love to go back to Andrea in a couple of weeks for another great massage.  I would highly recommend Kierland Massage Club.

I've seen Dr. Lillo for 10 years or so.  He listens to you and is always attentive, doesn't rush through your appt. I love that he can do back/neck adjustments! I probably see him 2-3 times a year for those alone.

I went here for breakfast over the long Thanksgiving holiday. I didn't know until then that they offer gluten free bread, so was thrilled to order GF toast with my breakfast. I wish I would have known that last time I was in. There is no mention of it, that I saw, anywhere on the menu. I just happened to tell our server that I didn't want any toast because I can't eat wheat and that's when she asked if I wanted GF toast. I am not sure what other GF breads or anything else they might offer, but will ask next time I am in.

I learned last time here that they offer gluten free bread so today assumed they could make GF French toast. But the server, Tami,  informed me they were too busy, since it's a weekend, to make me any. Disappointing. We left another restaurant with a long wait to come here. The other restaurant offers way more GF options. Anyway I ordered the two egg breakfast with hash browns and GF toast. My friend had biscuits and gravy. The order came out within minutes so it's clear they were not made to order. Not on a busy Saturday. I will say that the eggs were good but my hash browns were cold. The server did ask is how everything tastes but it was moments after our food came and we hadn't had time to try anything yet! I think the service is hit or miss. The food is decent. I'll probably come back but honestly a few things could be tweaked.

Visited this establishment last night, my second visit. I had been here with an out of town friend over the holidays for cocktails but did not eat on that occasion. Last night we ordered burgers, my friend got the Chili Cheeseburger and french fries, I ordered the Hatch Green Chile Burger with fries, on a GF bun. It was really not tasty at all. I didn't even finish it. The fries were meh. My friend said his burger was ok but not the greatest chili burger he's had. I think this place really hopes you will down a couple of their tequila shooters from their extensive list so that you won't know how awful the burgers really are. Our server, although polite, was clearly paying more attention to other tables, from what we heard they sounded like regulars, or maybe friends of hers. The atmosphere is trendy and fun, too bad the food is not comparable.

I was a fan of the club when I joined a few years ago, the cost was $10/month, so figured why not. However, this past year, I got divorced and moved to the north valley and the nearest club is about 15-20 minutes away, so I decided to cxl my mo-to-mo membership. I was aware of the cxl fee ($25).  Long story short, been a long difficult road trying to cxl my membership. Took 2 letters and a trip to the nearest location (this one is closest to me, at about 10 miles away). I was originally told due to the difficulties I encountered they'd waive my cxl fee, but last night when I got down to the club, I was informed by Tessa, the mgr, that they cannot do that. I feel they strung me along for a couple extra months and got an addl $30 out of me in the first place, they should have waived the cxl fee. I was so irritated but saw no way out except to pay the $25 and walk away. LA Fitness treated me the same way when I cxl'd my membership with them several years ago. I should have learned! Bait and switch, yes, will I Yelp about my experience? YOU BETCHA!

Went there last week for the first time, I am fairly new to Indian cuisine, so have been trying new places. The lunch buffet here was really nice with a plentiful selection of varied dishes. The selections were well stocked and looked and tasted very fresh. The only thing I was disappointed with was our server did not bring us any Dosas, although we did see others bringing them out to other tables. The place was quite packed, mid day on a Friday lunch rush, and our server did refill our beverages often, so overall it was a very good experience and I would visit again.

I like this particular Sprouts and recently stopped by on my lunch hour to pick up a few things for dinner that evening. Found out recently that you can order sandwiches from the deli and they make them anyway you want, they can even accommodate a gluten free request if you like, which impressed me. The sandwich was filled with everything I requested and did not skimp on a thing! The price was a mere $3.49, try getting that at a chain! Customer service is really good at this location.

Just wanted to mention that I stopped in to get a sandwich for lunch recently and they said if I wanted it on gluten free bread, I had to buy a whole loaf. I guess they decided a few months back to quit offering GF bread as part of their sandwich specials. Disappointing but oh well.

Sometimes with Groupon it's hit or miss. I have my share of the latter, but I was delightfully impressed with Michelle's from the instant I walked in. Sara gave me my mani-pedi and was just a joy to chat with for a couple of hours. The place is very ecclectic and kitschy inside, pictures of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn adorn the interior, really fun and unlike any other salon I've ever been to. They have a little boutique area filled with fun gift ideas as well. I will absolutely be back to have Sara do my nails and I will also be scheduling a hair appt. I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit and very thankful that they had a Groupon special otherwise I probably wouldn't have come across this place. Their prices are reasonable. They get 5 stars from this gal.

I. Love. This. Place. I have been GF for about a year (not by choice). I was so glad to find them.  Best GF bagels I have tasted, Cheddar Jalapeno specifically. Recently I got to try some of their Maple Bacon Donuts, in all their mapley-bacony goodness!! Sandwiches are tasty. Awelicious bread is really delicious as are their awelicious buns. I love their cupcakes too! NUM! Everything I have tried is wonderful. Service is always very good. Several local eateries use their GF foods, like US Egg and Spinato's for example. More eateries are listed on their website. Did I mention that I love this place?

My friend and I decided to eat here for lunch recently after reading the good reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. When we first arrived, they were giving out samples of the caramel sea salt milkshake, freakin amazing. I would have ordered one but even though I love milkshakes, they don't always love me back.  I ordered the Greek (lamb) burger; it comes medium rare, which I was fine with. I also wanted to mention that I ordered a gluten free bun, which, by the way, they make in house, very tasty, really quite delicious (not dry and cardboard tasting like Udi's). My friend got the Buffalo Bill (bison) burger and he liked it a lot. We split a large fries, and, although they informed us in advance that that the fries would come out first, I found that a bit odd, but no points off for that, since we ate all of them and they were pretty decent fries. Their sodas are quite unique, by Maine Root; I opted for the Prickly Pear lemonade soda, very sweet. No high fructose corn syrup in these babies! My friend got the Mexicane Cola and he enjoyed it. Overall it was a very good experience and we would definitely return.

I have given two days worth of thought to this review. First let me state that I love the concept of having them make your pizza in front of you, it's the Chipotle of the pizza world. A coworker who is gluten free like me recommended this place. So I went for lunch on Tuesday 1/20. I ordered the GF crust. The gal asked if I wanted her to put fresh gloves on so I said yes. I was glad that they took the GF thing seriously. After selecting my toppings, I paid for my pizza and asked the cashier if they could use a special cutter for my GF pizza. She replied that they have a special cutter just for GF pizzas. I was happy to hear that, however, when my pizza came out of the oven, a girl begin to cut my pizza with the regular cutter. She then realized what she did, and took the pizza to the back. I assumed it was to have a new pizza made. But no, she came right back with it. She grabbed what must have been the special GF cutter, and resumed cutting my pizza. I should have said something to her or asked to speak to the manager. I understand that mistakes are made, but to just cover it up was quite disappointing and sad, not to mention unprofessional. I do understand they have a disclaimer on their website about gluten free and cross contamination. But why bother offering GF if you're not going to take it seriously. So that along with the intestinal issues and bloating I've been suffering for 2 days is why I am giving this place 2 stars. I probably won't go back.

It was a take out kinda day and Thai is good comfort food what can I say. A friend recommended this place and it's not far from work so stopped there on my way home today for dinner.  I had the stir fried eggplant with chicken which I saw on another review and boy was it delish! The chicken and eggplant really complimented each other and the sauce was tasty. I also got some chicken panang and although it was a bit watery in my opinion, it was quite flavorful, I just added extra rice to soak up some of the sauce. The larb was probably some of the best larb I have tasted. They didn't ask, and I forgot to mention, the spice level so everything came sans heat. Next time, and there will def be a next time, I will make sure to inquire about a spice level, maybe start with a 3 to be safe.

I purchased a Groupon for a massage because of cost and location, so thought I would give them a try. First off, the massage room could have used a door, it only had a curtain, which left me feeling vulnerable, maybe a minor issue, not a dealbreaker. However, the music played during my massage was not conducive to a soothing, relaxing massage and that was a big pet peeve for me. The massage, by Matthew, was okay, but he talked about Herbalife and nutrition quite a bit so it was kind of a turn off. I am not in to MLM (multi-level marketing) at all. And since I work in the supplements biz, I was not interested. I did not try a smoothie but the selection looked very interesting.

Since I am vertically challenged, I needed a pair of slacks hemmed up. I saw the Yelp reviews on here and they are close to home so stopped by and dropped them off on my way home from work one evening. They were ready in just a few days and the cost was very reasonable. I will definitely come back for future alterations.

I feel compelled to update my previous review. This is due to the deplorable treatment I received when I took the altered pants back after the seam fell apart on one pant leg just a couple of weeks after they'd been hemmed. I showed it to the man that did the work who was so nice to me before. He said that it was due to washing the pants that the hem came out. Really (in my best Amy Poehler voice). I washed them twice after having them hemmed up. There was no apology given for the obviously poor workmanship. The best part? Had the audacity to charge me $6 to have the pant leg redone. And I paid it because I just wanted the pants done. As a result of the extremely poor customer service I received and the rude treatment, I would strongly encourage others in need of alterations to seek assistance elsewhere. Maybe at a competent business who values its customers.

As a native St. Louisan, I was very excited about SnS opening up in Tempe. But I have to say I was so very disappointed. The burger was mediocre at best, the bottom bun was soggy, the fries were different that I remember and also cold, but I was majorly bummed that I couldn't get the pickle relish, the mgr said they did away with that years ago. Huh? The relish is one thing that makes SnS unique! And no chili-mac?! Sad. The ambiance was not typical, it was more hip and trendy, trying to cater to the ASU crowd I'm sure. Overall, I have to say it was not the visit I hoped for or expected. Just a thought: if you're going to bring SnS to the Valley, bring the WHOLE experience as is, don't try to tweak it to be something we already have enough of.

I purchased a Groupon special looking for a good deal and location. I was very impressed with Jasmine from the get-go. Upon my arrival, she greeted me warmly. We talked for a few moments about what I wanted her to concentrate on, etc. She is soft spoken and possesses a calm demeanor, along with some soft massage-appropriate music, it all made for a very nice massage. I booked another appointment for next month and would definitely recommend Jasmine for a massage.

I just moved into the area and a neighbor highly recommended this place. Had dinner here last night with a friend. We started off with tea, I got the raspberry flavor, it was sweet and delicious. We then ordered the Lamb Vindaloo (medium spicy) and the Butter Chicken, these dishes are a la carte so we had to order a side of rice too. We also got naan for my gluten indulgent friend which he liked. We each tried both dishes and really enjoyed them.  The manager (owner?) of the place came over to our table not once but twice to chat and she asked how we enjoyed the food. We really like it and there was plenty leftover for my lunch today. The medium spice level of the Vindaloo was just right. Pricing was reasonable but I will say that the entrees should come with the rice. My overall experience was really good and I will definitely be back.

Before moving out of my apt, I found out I was responsible for cleaning the carpet. I called several services and got varying prices. Hydrocare was middle of the road price-wise and had so many positive reviews on Yelp I decided to hire them. They arrived within the agreed upon time frame, did a really good job on really dirty carpeting and were completed in a timely fashion. The carpet looked better than when I moved in a year ago. I will say I was a wee paranoid about a small traffic area that still showed a light stain the following day. They did agree to come back out and touch up the area but the apt manager went through the unit and said it looked fine so there was no need although I appreciated that they would have. They worked really hard to make the carpet look good and overall I was very pleased with them. So pleased that I would like to have them clean the carpet in my new place hopefully soon!

I have lived here for a few weeks and feel I have been mislead by the leasing staff about several things. First they tell you they offer basic cable which "includes channels like CNN."  However, that is not the case, which I found out only after moving in. You only get about 20 channels and CNN isn't one of them. I called the manager, Angel, about it and he said "well I was just telling you what basic cable is at my place" - seriously?! I called Cox and they told me if I wanted basic cable it would cost about $70/month. Next they claim it's a gated community and while there is a gate it wasn't working for the first month I lived there. I was told it's locked from 7am-7pm, but I've come home from work before then and it's already closed. After a couple days in my new apt, I was subjected to loud stereo music all night long. I complained to mgmt the next morning and there have not been any issues since;  they do have a Courtesy Patrol on site, although I have never seen them walking the property there at night. The maintenance people have had to come fix things 3 x in my apt in only 2 weeks.The bathroom was barely cleaned from the last tenant and I had to clean it myself. Drain was clogged in the shower so bad I had to take baking soda and vinegar to it to get it unclogged. It was gross. Several drawers in bathroom and kitchen were broken upon move-in. Microwave door has a huge burn hole in it and they claim since it still works it's not considered an issue but seriously it looks awful. There are cig burn holes in a small section of the linoleum in dining area. And to boot, I just got my water/sewer bill (they tell you it's going to be about $25-30/month, but it's closer to $40.) Newly divorced and on a tight budget, this is not great news in my book. The carpeting was cleaned before I moved in but the stains resurfaced after my first week. The space saver washer in my unit has a funny odor and several squirts of febreze and bleach have not been successful at ridding it. Although I do like the location of my unit in the complex and the close proximity to my work, stores, etc, I am really disappointed with my decision to rent here.

If you're thinking about renting here, turn around and run away.  Staff is deplorable.  Dishwasher is not working and I was told there's nothing they could do!  Suggested I try some vinegar, did that, not working. Told me to get CLR and that I had to pay for it and do it myself.  They are of no help. And now the gate is not working again, hasnt been for the past month.  I used to manage apartments for a living back in the 90's and if I had staff like them, I would have replaced them all with people who actually give a shit. I dislike this place immensely and cannot wait for my lease to be up, what a huge mistake.

Finally got the dishwasher issue resolved, but ONLY after contacting Dave at Capillano Properties, and even at that I had to leave a few messages for him to call me back. They installed a new (cheap) dishwasher. But after doing so, the linoleum in the kitchen where the dishwasher goes is pretty ripped up. And the installer didn't clean up the mess he made, there was a water trail  from the dishwasher to my front door. I cleaned it up. I was happy with a new dishwasher despite it's cheapness. It's about a $200 dishwasher and is not programmable like the other one was. However, the next morning I woke up to find water flooding my kitchen and dining area! I almost fell but caught myself! I called the emergency # and someone finally came to my apt about 45 minutes later. Turns out an error was made when the new dishwasher was installed. It was fixed but I had to clean up the entire water damage myself, took almost every towel I had to do so. The repairs took about 2 hours and I was late for work. Wait, it gets better. Dave at Capillano had promised that they'd get the carpeting cleaned for me. I made arrangements to do that the same day that I had to stay home from work so couldn't leave early the same day I had to come in late, so tried working with Angel the Apt Mgr to get that rescheduled. That was on November 4, over a month ago. I have emailed and left messages, no response. I called and left a message for Dave at Capillano, no response. Naturally I have taken pictures of the water and linoleum damage so that I will not be charged for these when I move out. Although Dave initially tried to make things right, and I thought he and Angel were sincere (Angel told me a month ago after I had called his boss "Oh but we're here for you Donna").  I have still been blown off and am still upset about the way I have been treated.

It only took 9 months but I finally got a response earlier this week on Yelp from Bell Cove regarding my review, which says to call the office. I did call, three times, only to get voice mail and since they never call you back I went in. Merissa was there when i walked in and I told her why I was there. I guess she didn't know about the review, so she went to get Angel, the Manager. His response was "I don't know, I didn't do it."  Since I'm here let me also state the issues with my faucets and water. Since the weather got colder, my hot water barely comes out, in both the bathroom and kitchen. A maintenance man that I saw on the grounds one day said all the apts are like that, there is nothing they can do. The faucets have great water pressure when it's 100 out but not when it's 40? IDK. Like I said in earlier reviews, run folks, surely there are other properties with management that care.

I have raised their one star rating to a two, only due to the maintenance staff. I was pleased with Josh and Anthony who came to look at my shower issues last month and told me that the weak shower pressure was not at all normal for the units like I  had previously been told (by someone who no longer works there). Josh had to remove several tiles to replace the water cartridge and once he got in there he realized it was a bigger problem than originally thought. He called a plumber who came out a few hours later and fixed the issue. The plumber also fixed the lack of water pressure which was an issue isolated to the water heater which was clogged with what was no doubt years of deposit build-up and corrosion. The plumber was very professional. I was thrilled to be able to take a normal shower for the first time in months. Josh and Anthony did have to come back out twice more, to install new tile and then to grout.   I recently gave my 60-day notice to vacate and that's when I found out that I have to clean the carpet before I move, or pay a minimum of $55 to have them do it. Sigh. Wasn't expecting that expense. I am hoping there will be no financial surprises after I move and have insisted upon a walk-through before I turn over the keys and move on from this place. I will say that there is a new person working in the office now, Collette, who is much easier to deal with than Merissa and Angel [who sadly still work there.]

I moved out recently and communicated my desire for a final walk through last week with the manager, Angel Seda. I asked if I could come in on Saturday and he said no problem, that he wouldn't be there but that Merissa would. I got there right as they opened Saturday morning, hoping to get things wrapped up before they got busy. Collette was there by herself for 15 minutes before Merissa showed up. I was told by both that only a leasing or maintenance manager (Josh) could do a walk through. I was fit to be tied! Angel did not mention this fact to me in our numerous email exchanges last week. I even mentioned this to both leasing agents but they were unwilling to accommodate me despite what Angel said. So now I have to come in either on my lunch break from work or after work today to get this mundane but necessary task completed. I reluctantly gave them my keys without having the walk through. So now anything could happen and it would be out of my control I paid to have the carpeting cleaned professionally (the staff doesn't mention that when you move in) and made sure the apt was move in ready for the next victim, I mean tenant. I am so glad to be away from this complex, it is by far the worst run community I have ever lived in, or managed, which I used to do years ago. I would really ask anyone considering a move here to give it serious thought and weigh all your options because there are several other options available that will give better peace of mind and less hassle than I experienced at Bell Cove.

I stopped in a few weeks ago and decided on the SOTD, tri tip. I also got the veggie of the day, which was potatoes, onions and peppers. Overall I wasn't thrilled with the tri tip, it was a bit dry. The bbq sauces though really helped and were very tasty (I mixed the spicy and the sweet). The veggies were average, nothing overly special. But I went back today with a coworker and ordered the chopped brisket sandwich (minus the bread, since I am GF) with a side of creamy cole slaw (they also have a Carolina version, which is a vinegar slaw). I have to say I was very impressed with the brisket, it was so delicious. The slaw was pretty tasty too. Also I was served homemade pickles with this meal, whereas on my first visit I was not. The pickles were really good. I only wish they offered a GF bun for the sandwich, that would have garnered 5 stars.  My coworker got the 2 meat plate, with the pork ribs and the brisket. He got 2 sides and one was the corn muffins, they are mini muffins but they give you 4. He really enjoyed them. Overall I'm glad I gave this place a 2nd chance. I would go back again, maybe bring my own GF bun next time:)

Stopped in again today and got the pulled pork sandwich. I asked for a gluten free bun and was very happy that they could accommodate me with that request. It's very thoughtful and considerate of the owner to offer gluten free buns. He came around to ask how the meal was, he really does care about customer service. The food was great and I love the spicy bbq sauce, got a lil kick to it, that's just perfect.

I really like coming here. They may be known for their sandwiches (and the fact they serve no Pho) but it's the noodle bowls that I tend to gravitate to. They are gluten free as are the rice dishes. Comes with your choice of two meats, I always get double chicken. The service is prompt and efficient. The staff is always nice.

NOT WORTH IT FOLKS! Not enough words to convey about my experience but here goes.  After reading all the hype, decided to take a chance and spend $30/ticket. I am a  fairly new Marvel fan and went with someone who is a [middle-aged] Marvel fan. The VIP tickets might have been a better bet IF I could have afforded them (about $100/ticket).  The "hyper reality" is just HYPE. Poorly executed event, to say the least. The lines were incredibly long and once you got to do or see something, it only lasted a couple minutes. We only got to do three things in our 3 hours there! We stood in line for one 3D event for over an hour and the even took just 2 minutes. In our experience, there were numerous equipment malfunctions and glitches, so many kinks have to be worked out yet. We went on 12/30 so assumed any issues would have been fixed by then, but nope! The staff was poorly trained and at times, many of them did not seem to have any management or guidance around. A couple staff members completely ignored us when we asked questions, and others simply did not know or seem to care.  OH and let me mention the $10 parking fee that they don't bother to tell you until you show up. Sadly we did not have cash on us and ended up being late to the ticket start time. Not a big deal in the end because at our 5pm start time we stood in line and waited for almost 20 minutes before being let in. At the end of the event you get a free cheap plastic bracelet for completing and passing the Shield training and becoming a Shield recruit, whatEVER. Also at the end is a souvenir store where you can pay for overpriced this and that. Walk right on out folks. This was a partial Christmas gift to someone I care about. I think it's safe to say we both felt let down. The hype says this event is geared to older kids and adults, however, it was clearly set up for younger kids, and kids under 6 were apparently free. Really young kids were the only one who seemed to enjoy it. And of course, food and beverage prices were astronomical. So overall, I would recommend foregoing this experience and save your money for something else. The people who put this on should be utterly ashamed of themselves. It was awful.

I emailed the Marvel Experience to let them know about my experience, 9 days later have not heard a word. They got my money, so why would they care. Two thumbs down.

I recently moved and passing by this place yesterday I saw the banner advertising a spa pedicure for only $16.99 and decided to give them a try. I was taken in right away and was initially pleased. I probably sat in the spa chair for about 15 minutes before being told that "I have an appt, so it's going to be a few minutes". I asked how long and was told about 5. I waited. The water in my spa was already getting cold. I did wait, more than 5 minutes and then was told I would need to wait longer, I asked how long and was told about 10 minutes. I was so bummed out that I just got up and left. If they would have simply told me up front that they were too busy, I would have been happy to come back but since they made me wait for so long and wasted my time instead of being honest, I cannot recommend this place and will not go back. There are nail salons on every corner, so I'm sure I will find a new salon more to my liking.

Love. The. New. Place. It's inside Papi Chulo's so the food is really delish. So much better than the other place at the old Anderson's. Sound is much better, IMO. And lest I not forget the BATHROOOMS (shout out, Howard!), they actually work lol! I will note that for opening night we did wait about 20 minutes or so before a server came over to us, however, once she took our order we had our food and drinks soon thereafter. I don't give them any points off for that because everything was new and there are always kinks to work out on the first night or two. Howard was as humorous as he always is. The comedians were really funny too. My friend and I had an enjoyable evening out!
