This review is in response to my interaction with the company while trying to assist an elderly gentleman being seen at our clinic trying to get a ride home. First the cab company phone line starts by blasting tejano music and they answer in Spanish. The operator informed me she doesn't speak English and transfers me to a voicemail to leave a message. I called back and got a English speaking operator and was informed that they had sent a cab and he got lost, they didn't attempt to find the patient and left him here. so I asked if they could send another cab and was informed that there are no longer any cabs in the area and I would have to call another company.. I find that to be exceptionally poor service, and a terrible way to leave a 92 year old man stranded and waiting for a cab that was never coming. THe proper response would be to apologize and get even more specific directions and ensure you can pick up the rider. This is completely unacceptable. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY

This little cafe is like coming home, Jackie is friendly and sweet. Ordered the award winning stuffed french toast and the hubby tried the baked pancakes. Everything on the menu looks amazing breakfast and lunch served all day. Very convenient and great value for price. Can't beat the homemade feel and atmosphere. Totally a gem in the city.
