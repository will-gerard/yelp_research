I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!

Once you've been to the gardens, there's no real need to go back unless you're a horticulturalist or have a strange affinity for succulents.  However, in what can only be described as brilliant marketing, the gardens regularly offers up art installations in a bid to get folks back.  It works - beautifully.  We saw the Chihuly exhibit years ago and we were back this time for the Bruce Munro exhibition.  Absolutely stunning - it runs through May - don't miss it.

Our annual Brides of March pub crawl patronized this establishment this past Saturday and I have to say, our experience was not exactly stellar.    I get that there were a lot of us.  I realize it must be a tall order to serve 100ish tipsy brides.  BUT, as I understand it, bars and restaurants were notified beforehand that we were coming.    And that is why there is no excuse for having to wait ONE HOUR for an appetizer platter.  An HOUR.  For fried things.  And to add insult to injury, people to our right and left were eating well before we were and they sat down after we did.  The icing on the cake was that we asked the waitress to substitute something else for the zucchini sticks and can you guess what happened?  We got zucchini sticks.    The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.  But the service was inexcusable.

I received a very nice email from the manager addressing our unsatisfactory experience.  I always appreciate when managers/owners care enough to reach out to an unhappy customer.  I will definitely give G&D another shot.

We needed a bite to eat and came here mid-Saturday afternoon.  Based on Yelp reviews, I was expecting better.     There were only one or two other parties in the restaurant and it took the waitress a rather long time to get to us.  I understand there was only waitress on at the time but the hostess and bartender were chatting at the bar while we waited for someone to pay attention to us.    My chicken was overcooked.  It was flavorful but tough. My wasabi mashed potatoes were tasty although there was no hint of wasabi whatsoever.    I had a mandarin mule that was okay but not great.    All in all, not a great experience.

I received a necklace a few years ago as a gift and it's absolutely beautiful but I knew it would see the sunshine more often if it was a ring.  I took my beloved necklace to these folks to create a sparkly new ring.  It took about two weeks and it was reasonably priced (I think?  This is honestly the first time I've ever had a custom piece made).  They were very friendly and accommodating.  Location-wise, it's not terribly convenient for me but I would probably make the trek again.

When my grandmother passed away, I inherited a lot of her old jewelry.  I kept the pieces I wanted and wondered if I could sell the rest.  Burland did a great job on my custom ring so I came back.    The appraiser, Mark, sat with me for a good long time going through each piece.  He helped me determine which pieces were worth getting officially appraised and which were not.  I settled on getting appraisals for 4 specific rings.  Another employee kindly sized the remainder of the rings which will help with resale.    They were extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The appraisals were done in about a week - great description and photos.    I know very little about jewelry so I always worry that I'm going to get fleeced.  This family-owned business appreciates each and every customer.  I will definitely return.

I don't frequent bars all that often (mostly because I don't enjoy them) but Merc is my favorite, hands down.  It's got a cool, speakeasy, Prohibition-era vibe that is really unusual.  The cocktail menu is by far the most interesting I've ever seen.  You don't go there to drink - you go there to experience.  We sat at the bar last night and were greatly entertained by the bartender and chef.  The bartender (I think his name was Aaron?) really knew his stuff.  I truly wish I lived closer...

Yesterday was my second visit here and it was great.  The patio is beautiful and is a great place to relax with friends and a cocktail.  My dirty martini was fantastic and the waitress even put it in a new frosty class halfway through.  Classy!  The menu is the same as Houston's except for a few sushi rolls.  I've always enjoyed Houston's and this is no exception.  The sushi rolls are tasty too.  The patio only offers sushi, appetizers and dessert.  The hot fudge sundae is the best in town.  It's a house made hot fudge that isn't actually hot and therefore doesn't turn your ice cream into soup 4 bites in.  Genius!

This is fun to wander around and follows the model of having cubbies that folks rent to sell their wares.  That means you'll find an endless of amount of anything and everything.  If you're into vintage/retro, this is definitely a place to visit.

I've been see Dr. Bruns off and on for over ten years.  He's always been extremely nice, approachable and caring.  This last time, I met with PA (I believe her name was Kelly) and she took quite a while with me trying to understand symptoms and possible causes.  She relayed the info to Dr. Bruns saving me the trouble of repeating myself.

I've known Dr. Lykins socially for several years.  When my allergist told me I needed to see a ENT and that surgery was probably inevitable, I broke my rule of not seeing friends for care or services.     He was extremely thorough and went through my CT scans with me to show me what was going on.  He also described in detail what the surgery would entail and what I could expect in regards to recovery.    They were able to schedule my surgery relatively quickly which was a relief because I had to be on antibiotics until I could get this procedure done.    Surgery was yesterday and as far as I can tell, it went great.  My pain levels are surprisingly low (about what they were pre-surgery which is exactly what Dr. Lykins said).    It's too soon to tell how successful this will be in addressing the chronic issues I've been having but all in all, the experience was great.  I would highly recommend Dr. Lykins and his staff.

Great experience!  We rented plates and martini glasses for a party and it couldn't been easier.  They were friendly and helpful on the phone.  Pick-up and drop-off were a breeze and...  apparently, between the time we placed our order and the time we picked the items, the "market price" had dropped and they gave us a much lower price.  I would definitely recommend!

It's my "home" airport and I forget how nice it is until I'm spending pre-flight time in a clinical, colorless place (Lambert St. Louis - I'm talking to you).  Security is usually pretty well organized and there are lots of food options before and after security.

I've lived in Phoenix almost 20 years and had never been here...  It's a solid put-meat-on-your-bones steakhouse.  Drinks were tasty, pre-dinner cornbread and biscuits were all kinds of yummy and the steaks were cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent and there's all kinds of memorabilia on the walls - get up and walk around between courses.

I know this is one of Phoenix's beloved local gems but I was underwhelmed.  The tour feels a bit like an episode of Hoarders: The Cat Edition.  "Castle" is a bit of a misnomer as it's more of a dwelling cobbled together with...  well, all kinds of things.  The founder's daughter was the last to inhabit the property and she had a cat obsession so the home, which might otherwise feel vintage and retro, feels like Goodwill-meets-nursing home.  (Make no mistake - I am absolutely a cat person and even have "cat paraphernalia" in my home.  But there's a fine line between cute and creepy.)    The property has some beautiful views and are definitely some unique elements to it.  I like the story that the original owner built it for his daughter and continued to expand on it.  I also like that her cat still lives there and occupies the upper floor during the day and roams the property at night.    If you want to tour a piece of Phoenix history, make your reservation for Tovrea Castle.

Where do I start?  The mai tais?  The ono?  The lobster potstickers?  Everything was so delicious.  We were celebrating a special occasion and we got a card and several "drive-by" congratulations from staff.    Be forewarned that this place is spendy.  It's also an "experience" aside from just having dinner.  Although we haven't done their Aloha hour in a while, it's a super deal. If you don't feel like dropping some cash on dinner, do Aloha hour.  It's an excellent value and is a great preview of their entrees.

This is my favorite Houston's/Hillstone alternative.  We've eaten here many times and it's almost always a great experience.    The Perfect Margarita IS perfect.  I never would have put olives in a margarita but it so completely works.    On this past visit, my cheeseburger was overcooked and they happily took it back and fired a new one.    Service is generally impeccable.  Although, we have noted that they seem to have a fear of letting any glass be less than 3/4's full.  As soon as you've consumed *any* of your drink, you will have another glass on the table.  I find this amusing.    Great place although it does tend to be a bit loud when it's busy.

We've been eating at Houston's as long as we've been in Arizona (15+ years).  I don't know that we've ever had a bad meal.  The burgers are out of this world.  The veggie burgers could win any carnivore's heart.  The ice cream sundae is perfection - chocolate ganache that isn't hot and doesn't turn my decadence into soupiness?  Yes, please.

I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews declaring this the best sushi in town.  We had a former sushi chef dining with us and he declared it "the real deal."  The freshness is incredible and they have an amazing selection of rare and unusual options.  Service is perfect - plates were cleared quickly without us feeling rushed.  Our meal hit all the right notes and it's going to be hard to sushi anywhere else.

I have been plagued with life long allergies and as wonderful as aging is, the allergies seem to be worsening.  My best friend recommended this practice and specifically Dr. Erdos to me.    Prior to going there, I had seen my primary doctor, an ENT and another allergist who put me through allergen testing in case I wanted to start allergy shots even though I told her on the first appointment that I didn't want allergy shots.    Dr. Erdos is kind, thorough, friendly and listens.  He seems to be very "current" which I appreciate.    My first experience was at the Mesa office.  Everyone was extremely nice but it was terribly slow.  I was there for 2 hours just for an evaluation.  My second experience was at the Scottsdale office and that was much more efficient.  Prior to leaving, you get a print-out of the recommendations, prescriptions, and directions discussed during the appointment.  THIS IS FANTASTIC.  If you're sick and experiencing meth-like shakes from too much sudafed, it is so helpful to be able to review these notes later.    Thank you Dr. Erdos and Arizona Asthma and Allergy Institute!

If there was a 10th level of hell, I think this place might be it.  We had a coupon for a detail.  We made an appointment but that didn't really seem to matter.  If you get a detail, expect to wait about 4 hours.  But do not wait there.  The "waiting area" feels like the business is squatting in a building that doesn't belong to them.  Abandoned soda fountain.  Parts of the ceiling missing.  Extremely uncomfortable chairs that are obviously designed to urge you to go away.  It honestly reminded me of the limbo waiting room in Beetlejuice.  Except I think that one was more entertaining.

Unfortunately, this restaurant deserves the ratings that it had.  Service was spotty and the food was so-so.  Pre-meal chips were mostly stale.  Our waitress seemed frazzled and when I asked for a drink menu, she said they didn't have one because they were revamping it.  She seemed annoyed to have to explain the different kinds of margaritas available.    Dissapointing all the way around.

Although I generally see Dr. Erdos at the Scottsdale location, I get my allergy shots at this location.  Occasionally, when I don't feel like schlepping to two different offices, I'll see a doctor at this location.  I saw Dr. Ching last week and she was fantastic.  Extremely knowledgeable, thorough, and recognized a recommendation from my ENT was in my file and addressed it with me because it's a specialty of hers.    Much like Dr. Erdos, she provided an excellent level of care and I would not hesitate to see her again.

Our usual sushi spot in Glendale is Sushi Catcher but upon discovering that it's now closed on Tuesdays, we found ourselves at Fresh Wasabi.    Reasonable prices, interesting rolls and fresh fish!  The ambiance here is nicer than Sushi Catcher and that's a draw for me.  Service was excellent.    My only complaint?  A restaurant called Fresh Wasabi doesn't serve fresh wasabi (unless it's an add-on item I missed on the menu).  I dislike the creepy green paste on every plate of sushi and thought I just hated wasabi... until I had fresh wasabi.  So, Fresh Wasabi, starting bringing your customers fresh wasabi.  :)

I've driven by this place numerous times on my journeys north and south.  Today we finally stopped.  Unfortunately, I haven't been missing a whole lot.    The beer situation was weird.  4 of us ordered beer.  Three of us apparently got the last cold beers.  A waiter handed my friend a can of beer, warned her that it was warm but he brought a frosted glass.  Ummm...  what?!?!  She ordered a different beer.    Most of the table had received our food while one in our party remained food-less.  It was a good 5 - 7 minutes after we received our food that his was finally brought out.  He ordered the same dish as my husband (Chicken and Biscuits).  My husband's dish was cold.  The tardy dish was clearly given gravy that was left over (most likely) from chicken fried steak.  The chicken tacos were fairly tasty but needed some salsa.  I'm not a pie person so I got a slice of red velvet cake.  Sadly, it was disappointing.  It was dense like red velvet cake should be but it was really dry and the frosting was just barely cream cheesey.  3 in our party that ordered pie were satisfied (I tried all of them and they were indeed, very good).    My advice: Get a pie...  to go.

I was a bit dubious because this is an older hotel but we had a lovely time.  We opted to bunk here for the weekend because we had back-to-back concerts in the west valley.    Our room was huge and poolside.  The fridge was empty - THANK YOU!  I so appreciate having room for food and drink.  Beds were comfy and the bathroom was nicely appointed.  There was even a nice little bar area where we could keep our drinks.    We only ate the Tower Bar and it was a light lunch but it was fabulous.  Daiquiris, greek salad and hummus.  Delish!    I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the folks I encountered were nice and very helpful.    Be forewarned that it is a large property and it's easy to get lost.  When you check-in, the bell staff will have you follow them in a golf cart to take you to your room.  They also seem to have random staff roaming the property probably for maintenance purposes but they'll also pick you up and take you to your room if you get lost.  :)    Summer rates are reasonable and it was a nice little getaway.

I was rear ended last week and the person who hit me had Geico insurance.  Geico coordinated the entire repair and sent me to Larry H. Miller Collision Center.  The entire thing couldn't have been easier.  I dropped my car off and picked up a rental all at the same place.  My car was ready a week later and the exchange was a breeze.  Car looks great!

Having spent much of the last year shuttling back and forth between doctor's office, I always appreciate going to a practice that is well run and well staffed.  That is definitely the case at Endocrinology Associates.    I met with the doctor, had a thyroid ultrasound and bloodwork done within an hour (they have an on-site lab which is super convenient).  Dr. Harari called me personally less than 48 hours later with my bloodwork results.    Definitely recommend!

The food was delicious.  Definitely a "down-home" restaurant and you're treated like family.  The complimentary salsa was delicious although our chips were slightly stale.  The cheese enchiladas were stellar and my companion thoroughly enjoyed his fish tacos.    The thing about "you can't beat the $2 margaritas"... well, you can.  I think our margaritas may have spent time near tequila at some point but I'm not convinced there was actually any in there.  Skip the drinks and order the food.

The glowing Yelp reviews brought me here and it was good but not (in my opinion) deserving of the rah-rah-rah.   Note that this is an order-at-the-counter type of place as opposed to a restaurant-restaurant.    My fish tacos were tasty although a bit bland.  The actual fish was delicious and well prepared but the tacos themselves could have used a little zing.  I did add the salsa that was given to us and that helped but it still felt like it missing something.

This review is specifically for the optometry area.  The optometrist IS an independently operated office so that is something to note.  My exam was standard and while I was waiting for my pupils to dilate, Dr.  Bush sent me out to pick out frames.    Prices for glasses are very reasonable.  Frame prices range from $40 - $120 so you can really spend as much or as little as you want.  I do not have vision insurance so pricing is very important to me.    I will say that it's not as service oriented as other providers but hey, it's Costco.  You get what you pay for.

We had some time to kill and needed to stock up on a few items so we looked up the nearest liquor store and Henry's was it.  When we pulled up, we both strongly considered not going in - it's a bit seedy looking and with a drive-thru.  However, the inside was a pleasant surprise.  You'll be better served at Total Wine or Bevmo if you're looking for something super high end but for traditional bar classics, they've got everything you need.  The owner was super nice and helped us pick out a bottle of arak.  He also threw in a few shot glasses too.  Support local businesses!

Ordinarily, Nordstrom is a bit too spendy for my tastes but when I need new bras, I go nowhere else.  Their bra fitting specialists know their stuff and can find something for every bosom.  There is so much variety in bras across brands and sizes and these ladies help you navigate the annoying but necessary world of bras.    There is nothing and I mean NOTHING graceful about trying on bra after bra but walking out of there will well fitting support for the girls is priceless.  Suspend your modesty for an hour and let these ladies help your girls be all they can be.

What a fantastic little place.  Apparently, it's been around for years but I never knew it existed.    Definitely a fun place for a nice flight, some light snackage and Scottsdale people watching.    A pig walks into a bar...  No, really.  A pig walked in while we were there.  The pig was on a leash with it's owner and they strolled around the patio and inside the pub.  I got the feeling the pig was a frequent customer and probably has a more refined palate than I do.

I can't believe I'd never been here until past weekend.  Ruth's Chris is a perfect blend of Arizona dressy - it's a fancy-ish place but there are people in shorts, jeans, etc.  I enjoy eating off of white tablecloths without being dressed to the hilt.    Drinks were fantastic.  We tried the strawberry basil gimlet, the blackberry sidecar, and the blueberry mojito.  That alone makes me want to come back for happy hour.    We started with crab cakes which may have been the best crab cakes I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked flaky crab with nary a hint of fishiness, resting comfortably in melted butter.    The steaks arrive on 500  degree plates swimming in butter and that is a beautiful thing.  All of the sides I sampled (mushrooms, potatoes au gratin an asparagus) were tasty although the mushrooms were a tiny bit bland.   Service was attentive and friendly.  It IS expensive so if you aren't prepared for this, there might be a bit of sticker shock.  We knew in advance that it would be on the spendy side.    Great experience and I look forward to going back!

Let's just say 4 friends were slightly inebriated after a gin mixology class.  And let's just say that those 4 friends decided to stay for dinner at Lon's.  And we'll also say (theoretically, of course) that those 4 friends might have required the assistance of a dolly to leave the restaurant.    The restaurant itself is beautiful. Classy, upscale, and spendy.  Because we were clearly knee deep in bad decisions, we ordered more cocktails - yum.    The basket of bread they bring is gluten nirvana.  The house pulled mozzarella was a wonderful way to start our meal.  The ahi tuna appetizer might be the best piece 'o fish I've ever had.  It was tender, buttery, and so fresh that it nearly jumped in my mouth all by itself.  The truffle mac n' cheese is required eating as well.  Desserts consumed at our table were the cowboy candy bar, peach cobbler, and sorbet - all got rave reviews.    This is a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious meal with friends.  I would like to come back to have dinner on the patio when it doesn't feel like hell outside.

Dear Papago,  I love you.  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.  The server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.  I will probably be back but I think we need some time apart.   Love, Hungry Girl

I haven't yet returned but wanted to say that I very much appreciate the owner's response!  That says a lot about your care for customers.  I think I may find myself schlepping down to South Scottsdale sooner than planned.  :)

This is a brilliant idea and I'm surprised not to have seen it before - they rent individual "spaces" to folks so there are literally ALL KINDS of things here.  It is possibly one of the most eclectic collections of things I've ever seen.  It's not a great place to go if you're looking for something specific.  But if you want something unique and you've got an hour or so, start browsing the aisles.

Upon moving to AZ, we tried Z'Tejas and I was not a fan.  I can't say why exactly - the food just didn't do much for me.    I gave it another shot recently and I'm a convert!  My smoked chicken quesadilla was delish and they have a great drink menu (I had a watermelon concoction with black sea salt).  Staff was great!

I attend a lot of concerts and I think I can safely say this is the last one I'm going to attend at The Marquee.  The acoustics are not wonderful but are acceptable.    My main problem is that the slope of the floor from the stage to the back is small enough that I cannot see behind the throng of people watching the show through their phones (WHY!?!?!).  They used to do a VIP area which was a nice option but I haven't seen it for several shows.    Drinks are overpriced but that's to be expected.  I like the intimacy of it but don't really want to spend another concert trying to see around peoples' phones.

I'm an avid concert-goer and have spent a LOT of money at the Marquee in both drinks and tickets.  The Marquee isn't a bad place to see a show - it's just not my favorite.    However, this update is targeted to their new "VIP" section.  A month or two back, I received an email saying we could upgrade our concert tickets from GA to VIP for only $10.  The email promised a dedicated bathroom, bar and some seating.  We thought "Why not?" and forked over the extra funds for the VIP experience.  (The email also intimated that this was a special low price because it's a new offering and would likely be significantly more expensive in the future).    The whole thing was a bust.  The bar was nice although I've never had an issue getting a drink downstairs.  Dedicated bathrooms were also nice but my friends still had to wait in line (usually the case downstairs too).  We spotted some booth bench seating  and headed towards it only to be stopped by security and told it was "$100 a head" to sit there.  Asssphincter says what?  $100 a head to sit on a freakin' bench?  Are you kidding me?  Apparently, we were important but not THAT important.      At that point, our only option was to stand two people deep because the front standing spots were taken.    So, we took our $10-extra-dollar-VIP-asses and went down to GA.  We were literally right next to the bar AND we had a much better view.    Years ago, Marquee used to have a VIP section on the right as you walk in.  It was a roped off section on the floor with a dedicated bartender.  That was nice and worth paying for.  I was disappointed when they stopped doing it.     Bottom line - don't waste your money on VIP.  Even for sold out shows (as last night was), you can STILL have a better experience on the floor.

Here's a novel idea: Open a comedy club with food that doesn't come from the freezer section of Costco.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?    I had high hopes for the "new and improved" Tempe Improv.  I love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening.  Unfortunately, the new policies have made it that much harder.    They automatically add an 18% gratuity to EVERY CHECK.  Had our service not been terrible, I wouldn't have minded this nearly as much.  Our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything.  We asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show.  Long before this though, two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table.    They've changed the "two item minimum" to a "two drink minimum" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier.    The menu looks very much the same as the old menu.  The food quality is, overall, poor.  My husband's quesadilla was TINY.  It looked like a child's plate.  My buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before.  It had clearly been around a while.  It wasn't even warm and was tough to cut.  The pretzel appetizer was okay but I am spoiled for pretzels thanks to Claim Jumper and Arrogant Butcher.  These were slightly better than the Super Pretzels you bake at home.   The drink situation is highway robbery, prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time.  My friend and I ordered standard cosmos.  They arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid.  They were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else.  The waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table.  Upon reviewing the check, she did take off the cosmo but I noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for SMIRNOFF.  Smirnoff.  Are you kidding?  She even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no.  Smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind.  What do you get without an upgrade?  Harry's Toilet Vodka?  We all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down.    The one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor.  Admittedly, it was nice not to be so crammed in.    Despite these issues, we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw Michael McDonald).  As I said earlier, I love stand-up but the current practices at the Improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back.

After my initial review, I was contacted by a manager who offered me free tickets to come back and give The Improv another shot.  This gesture speaks volumes to me about how much owners and managers care about the customer experience.    We used our complimentary tickets this past weekend.  Unbeknownst to me, we had "reserved" seating right up front (Thanks Joe!).  Our server was much more attentive this time around.  I will note that we did not eat nor partake of any mixed drinks.  My husband ordered beer and I had wine.  All in all, it was a MUCH better experience.    My only complaint...  the parking.  It was game night at ASU and the parking situation was ridiculous.  We were stopped at the entrance to the parking lot by a gentleman who gave us an Improv parking pass.  This did little good and we drove around for 50 MINUTES looking for a spot.  The only way to get a spot was to literally stalk someone to their car.  We were about 5 minutes away from giving up and going home.  At the ticket window, I encountered a gentleman who was trying (unsuccessfully, as far as I saw) to get a refund on his show tickets because he couldn't find a parking spot.    I will absolutely come back to The Improv but you better believe that I will check to see if it's a game night first.  Many thanks to Joe and The Improv for giving us an opportunity to come back.

This place feels like your eccentric uncle's liquor stash.  If you're in need of something unique or different (and I was), this is the place to go.  It's not the cheapest place you can go but you don't come here for price.  I found a local bourbon for my husband which he is really enjoying.  It definitely has the feel of a family establishment.  Check it out!

Best friend took me here for dinner last week and it was delicious.  The risotto was absolutely delicious and my cocktail was fantastic.    I do think the servers could be a little more attuned to diner allergies.  My best friend is highly gluten intolerant and explained this to the server.  He went to the kitchen to make sure the risotto was GF and sure enough, it was.  However, we ordered a caprese salad to start and when it arrived, a good half of it was covered in bread causing me to jump into best-friend mode and perform salad surgery.

I had the unfortunate task of taking in my friend's kitty who passed away while she is on vacation.  Even though I tried to steel myself in the car to not become a blubbering mess once I walked in, it happened anyway.  The girls at the front desk were so nice and caring.  They treated the kitty with a lot of dignity and I appreciate that.

I live in Desert Hills and I always forget about this place.  Thanks to Restaurant Week, we went there again and it was delicious.  We were starting to suspect the bartender had some sort of time travel machine because our drinks arrived nearly at the same moment we ordered them.  Our meals were tasty and the service was great.  Beautiful setting.

Gritty is probably the best word to describe this place.  It's your real deal country restaurant.  You don't go for inventive menus or ingredients.  You go for the cowboy hat wearin' cook who just nods and smiles.   I enjoyed my pancake (which is more than enough for one person - they are big 'uns!).  It's a fun little morning adventure.

Meh.  We come here every year for our Brides of March pub crawl.  In general, it's a nice bar with a great patio and a fun cocktail menu.  This year, they screwed the pooch.  They were supposed to have food available and did not.  My friend was purchasing drinks for the table.  Unsure of what I wanted, I flipped through the handy dandy cocktail list.  There was a page for Grey Goose cocktails, one of which was a Grey Goose Orange.  It sounded yummy so I asked her to get me that.  The bartender apparently had no idea what it was so I got Greg Goose and Orange juice.    If you're going to push top shelf liquors with ads ON THE TABLES, maybe you should have a look at the drink suggestions.  I also wonder if they had a run on glasses because there was a guy hovering over our table just waiting to whisk our glasses away.  Buzz off, dude.  My vodka/orange juice flavored ice cubes were tastier than my actual drink.

Stayed here over the weekend and had a great experience.  Rooms were large and comfortable.  Nice bathroom products.  With our booking, we were supposed to receive a dining credit but the front desk person forgot and we never went to ask for it.  Good strip location.  I would definitely stay here again!

Yum, yum, and yum.  After a week+ in the desert, we were in need of of some serious fancypants food and drink.  RM Seafood fit the bill quite nicely.    The craft cocktails are a treat.  The sushi rolls are out of this world.  Don't miss the lobster mac n' cheese.  My companion very much enjoyed the oyster sampler.    My only critique is about the hostess.  She is clearly unhappy with her job and/or her station in life.  Smiling now and then would be a vast improvement.

Wonderful place to have lunch!  I love that they offer a full menu during the day as I prefer to eat my big meal of the day at lunch.  Menu was extensive and the service was wonderful.  My filet was cooked perfectly.  The brownie sundae was terrific - it's more like a flourless cake.    Super cute place and I will definitely be returning!

So amazing.  I spent three two weeks in France earlier this year and this dinner was a throwback to all of the wonderful food I had across the pond.  The bread dish was fantastic and the French butter - lordy!  All of the courses were inspired, fresh and delicious.  Cocktails were fantastic.    I want to recognize our server and I'm embarrassed that I can't recall his name.  He served us last Saturday evening at the bar seats and he has a man-bun.  He did something super cool - we ordered our tasting menu items at the start.  The lady seated next to us got a different dessert than I selected and it was GORGEOUS.  I kept ogling it and shortly before dessert, he brought me a menu and said "I believe you still need to select your dessert."  With all that was going on, I'm stunned he noticed and the way he let me re-select was super suave and classy.     On top of that, all of the desserts had dairy so he got a dairy-free dessert from the next door restaurant for Husband.   It was definitely a spendy meal but it's worth the experience.  I look forward to trying the signature restaurant next door.

I have neutral feelings about BBQ but this place was great.  I was dubious as we pulled into the parking lot.  I worried we accidentally wandered into a crack den.  However, once we found the front door, I was pleasantly surprised.  Super cute inside and a nice patio I'd love to visit when it's not 110 degrees outside.  The mac n' cheese was fabuloso and our waitress was fantastic.  My salad was a little bland but that is my fault for ordering a salad at a BBQ restaurant.  My dining companions were super pleased with their plates o' meat.

I enjoyed our dinner here although I think this might be more of a happy hour destination.  We had the trio of dips which were lovely.  I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.      I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, I'd make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.    We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful.  The brownie was sort of like the bastard child between cake and a brownie.  Denser than cake, not as dense as a brownie.    Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, attentive, and helpful.

Fantastic experience!  We purchased the Groupon for the prix fixe dinner *and* were treated like non-couponed folks.    There are two seating choices for this restaurant - a regular 'ole table or you can sit kitchen-side (kind of like a sushi bar) and watch the chefs prepare.  They're also  happy to take questions.    We opted for the "epicurean experience" which was fascinating.  It does interfere with conversation a bit so if you're having the "I think we should see other people" or "I like your brother in a way that is not condoned in the Bible", you may want to opt for a table.    The food was exceptional.  My ceviche-style poached lobster was magic on a fork.  The skirt steak was beautifully prepared and the "cigar" dessert is not to be missed.    The mojitos were outstanding - the right blend of sweet and tart along with a sugar cane stick for good measure.  Service was fabulous.  It took longer than perhaps is reasonable for our dessert to come out but our server explained that the kitchen had gotten a little backed up.  Really, the only reason I cared is because I was anxious to try to much the much touted Deseo Cigar.  It was worth the wait.

A few friends and I have committed to trying a new place once a month or so.  This was our first field trip and it was a worthy destination.    Up in the hills of north-north Scottsdale, Sassi is in the shadow of the Pinnacle Peak mountains.  The property itself is gorgeous and very much feels like a wedding venue (and it apparently is!).    Enormous leather chairs and distinctive rooms give this place a very lodge-y homey feel.    Drinks were fantastic.  If you're a fan of both tart and sweet, you can't go wrong with the limoncello martini.  The table shared a few apps...  the octopus (which I didn't have but am told it was excellent), the caprese salad and the meatballs.    The caprese salad is possibly one of the best I've ever had.  Moist, flavorful mozzarella atop seasoned heirloom tomatoes, basil and fancy pants olive oil - yes, please.    Although not touted as one of their "specialties," my scallops were amazing.  Again, quite possibly some of the best scallops I've ever had. There was a delicate lemon flavor and when combined with the peppery greens, it was an intense and unique flavor combination.    This is a destination meal.  Don't "stop by" for quick before a show or other engagement.  Make this your main event.    There was one aspect of evening that was slightly off putting.  Our reservations indicated that we had one dairy-sensitive and one gluten-free person.  The menus were clearly designed to address food allergies and that was wonderful.  However, gregarious and friendly as our server was, he did not have a good grasp on what "gluten free" meant.  I think servers have a responsibility to educate themselves (or be educated) about what specific food allergies encompass so that they may make accurate menu suggestions.

We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.    The real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day.

We found this place via the fabulous Yelp mobile app.  We were in a part of Gilbert I don't find myself in very often.  It was rated quite highly and we were in the mood for Mediterranean fare.     The outside is somewhat misleading.  There are advertisements all over the windows for standard "American food".  It reminds me of some of the restaurants I've seen in Europe that are trying to appear or cater to Americans ("USA Fried Chicken", for example.)    We were quickly seated and a quick glance at the menu confirmed that we were indeed in Hummus-ville.  The food was delicious.  The hummus was extremely smooth and creamy and had great flavor.  The pita bread was standard and given it's primarily a delivery system of hummus, I'm okay with this.  My falafel veggie wrap was delicious and my husband thought his gyro was the best he's ever had.  We both ordered the Greek fries.  I've always wondered about the authenticity of those because it seems like an excellent way to draw in Americans.  But no matter... they are gooey and delicious.    This is definitely a great little find.  I wish I lived closer!

We have a Halo Rescue and I'm ashamed to say that until this past weekend, I'd never been here.  It's small but they have some GOOD stuff.  We lucked out on 50% off day and scored some serious deals.  Halo is a wonderful organization and I'm happy to patronize a store that benefits rescue animals.  Add this to your thrift crawl!

Fantastic place - they have possibly the freshest fish in the valley.  Their menu is extremely interesting and the servers are eager to make recommendations and describe anything on the menu you don't understand.    I do recommend a reservation at dinner at it's gets rather crowded.  Don't miss the cocktails made with Sochu.

I've been here a few times and have always found it so-so.  Our past visit rocked my socks!  The mojito was delicious - wonderful balance of mint, lime, sugar and rum.  My steak was a tad pricey but it too was delicious.  It's a bit on the spendy side but I'd definitely go again.

Love this place!  We've done both theaters and although both are nice, the seats in the Cinema Suites can't be beat.  The drinks are tasty and the food is pretty good as well.    The only downside is that because seats are reserved, this is not a good last minute option.  We considered going yesterday but after looking online and realizing there were only 5 seats left and none of them were together, we rescheduled for today.  Make sure you take your garage ticket in with you to get it validated.

Having been here really makes it difficult to go anywhere else.  The Cinema Suites are so comfortable and were the only way I'd be able to watch The Dark Knight Rises (it breaks my 2 hour movie rule).  The wait staff is great and they actually have decent food.  It's a little pricey but hey, you're at a movie!  Our waiter last night was wonderful about accommodating my request that my fries be in a separate bowl from my sandwich.  Love this place.

I will preface this review by saying that this is our absolute favorite theater and I cannot remember the last time we saw a movie at a different theater.    This past Tuesday night, however, was a bust.  We arrived at the theater 20 minutes early so that we would be able to enjoy the preview and movies with minimal distractions.  We didn't see a server until well into the first preview.    My friend wasn't feeling well and wanted to get a box for her food.  It took 3 requests from 2 different people just to get a box.  It took 2 requests to get a drink refill.    We told the server in the beginning how we wanted the checks divided and that wasn't done as asked either.    Like I said, this is our favorite theater and I hope this was just a bad night and not indicative of how things will be in the future.

This remains my favorite restaurant in the valley.  It is expensive and you'll be here quite a while so be prepared for both.  The tasting menu is the way to go and it's fun to go with a group so you get to try even more things.  We go there several times a year and they know us which is pretty impressive.  The staff and service are always excellent.  If you're looking for a special experience, this is it.

This place reminds me of what Goodwill used to be although I daresay they have better stuff.  The "home" section is rather junky but they have a ton of clothes priced very reasonable.  And not all uber faded shirts with bleach spots either.  Check it out!

This outfit is a class act.  All of the staff we encountered were fun, friendly, and enthusiastic.  They clearly enjoy their jobs and that always makes for a better experience.    I'll be honest - I was pretty nervous about this adventure because I have an issue with heights.  In fact, I intentionally didn't let myself think about this the entire week prior because I was convinced I would freak myself out.  And strangely, it was okay.  The only dicey part for me was right before we took off and the balloon started to lift slightly from the ground.  The reality of the situation is a little startling but once we were up and away, I was oddly unaffected.  (And I will note that I even tried to freak myself out.  I purposely looked down at the ground and tried to guess the injury level if one were to jump.  Still okay.)    The ride is gentle and perhaps even relaxing.  Remember seeing miniature landscapes under glass at a museum?  It's a lot like that.  At the conclusion of the ride, we were treated to appetizers and champagne.  From beginning to end, it took about 3 and a half hours.    I don't know that I would be compelled to do another ride in Arizona because as a local, the novelty of cacti and coyotes has worn off but if I had guests that wanted to do it, I would definitely book with this company.

The cleaned our carpets this week and did a great job.  The only hiccup is that the team scheduled to do our home broke down.  The owner called to alert me and he was clearly upset.  As a fellow small business owner, I very much appreciate the communication when things go wrong.  He arrived to do the job himself and they applied a sealant for free since they arrived so far behind the scheduled time.  I would definitely call them again!

Came here for a girls' evening last Friday.  I'm not so much a fan of the forced "complimentary valet" but the city of Phoenix is grooming me to expect such things if I want to eat in the area.    The restaurant is cute.  Menu is diverse and they have a great cocktail list.  The goat cheese appetizer is pretty fantastic if you like goat cheese.  The food is good, but not great.  I had the vegetable flatbread pizza and with a little more seasoning, it would have been delicious.  Our table shared the cheesecake in a jar as well as the stout cake - all were delicious (and I'm a tough customer when it comes to chocolate cake).    Our waitress was generally fantastic all evening.  She seemed a little short when there was a mix-up with the credit cards and amounts but was back to being cheery as soon as it was fixed.  I will definitely return!

Our realtor recommended this company to fix the unit in our rental.  They were fantastic about contacting our tenant and scheduling to see her the very next day.   We waited to hear from the company about what needed fixing and how much it would be.  Never heard from them.  My husband received a call yesterday asking where to mail the invoice.    Understandably, he was frustrated about not being notified about the repairs before they were done and what the cost would be.  He expressed his frustration and the woman completely ignored it and continued asking where she could mail the invoice.      Did they forget?  Possibly.  Things happen and I understand.  But it is not okay to gloss over an unhappy customer without even so much as an "I'm sorry.  We should have called you and I'm sorry we didn't."   There are too many choices out there these days to work with companies who don't care about their customers.

Thanks to Yelpers, we took the leap and had lunch here.  I'd seen it before...  bright, shiny and  looking conspicuously like a former Five-and-Diner on Baseline.  I'll admit, the exterior was a bit off-putting but Yelpers inspired me to give it a shot and I'm glad we did.    As mentioned in other reviews, the lunch prices can't be beat.  The hummus was fantastic - strong tahini and lemon flavors.  The falafel most certainly is not from a mix (or if it is, I'm betting it's in a language I can read nor speak).  The rice is uber simple but fantastic.  I don't know why.  Perhaps they ground up fairies?    Fairy dust or no, we'll definitely be back.

I've been shopping at Sally for a couple years and have always had good experiences.  Today I received exceptional service and I had to let folks know.  I came in with a question about gel nails (Gelish vs. IBD).  The lady who helped me called one of her other managers who is a certified nail tech to ask my questions.  They were extremely helpful and went above and beyond what I would expect.

I checked in yesterday morning for outpatient surgery and it was as positive as a surgery process could be.  The nurses were all extremely friendly and helpful.  They got me warm and comfy before heading off to the operating room.  Post-op, they brought me juice and ice chips.  They were also wonderful about coordinating with my husband to pick me up.

I'll admit... when a friend picked this as a place for dinner, I was dubious given the 3 star-ness awarded by Yelp.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.    We arrived early and opted to sit at the bar for a bit.  Margaritas were quite good!  Certainly not the best I've ever had but definitely acceptable.  I suspect they may add a wee bit of crack to their tortilla chips because they were ridiculously addictive.  The hot sauce was quite good as well.    I ordered a rice and beans burro, enchilada style.  While it could have used a bit more sauce, all components were good and melded quite well together.    Service was a little slow but as we sat in the bar, I find that to be an acceptable compromise.  It's cute inside and has a great patio.  It's extremely affordable as well - margs were $3 during happy hour.    I'm not in this neighborhood very often, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.

A lot of folks bag on chain restaurant and generally, I AM one of those folks, but Macayo's remains consistent and tasty.  It's kind of like a friend-with-benefits.  You're never getting married but every time you hook up, you know exactly what you're going to get.

Wow, wow, wow.  My first Nearly Naked Production was Cock and it will not be my last.  This production was truly naked in the sense that there were no props, no sets and some non-gratuitous nudity.  The acting was brilliant and the play itself was beautifully written.  Looking forward to the next show.

This is one sexy salon!  Love the bedouin vintage-y feel - it feels like a very fun place to be.    Stacy really had her work cut out for her.  I wanted something different but didn't really have any specifics in mind.  She was able to take my existing color, build from it and do a really nice color array from there.    Great experience and I will definitely be back!

Yum, yum, and yum.  Our cocktails were expertly mixed and the drink menu is primarily craft cocktails.  My grilled meatloaf was outstanding and at my waitress' urging, I tried the achiote squash that came with it.  It wasn't my favorite thing ever but getting me to eat squash is a monumental achievement.    They were able to give us a last minute reservation which was great.  The patio is adorable too.  I look forward to coming back.

We attended the mixology class here yesterday and this review is for the class.    Apparently it was supposed to be in the Jade bar and we were supposed to have the hands-on experience of making our own drinks.  Their website even states that class size is limited to 10.  Unfortunately, this is not what happened.  There were at least 20 people there and they moved us into a room adjacent to the restaurant.  We watched our host make drinks and waitresses brought us those same drinks that were pre-made in the kitchen.    For me, part of the enjoyment of these kinds of events is learning something new.  I am much more likely to make things myself at home if I've done it in a class.  All we got to do was watch the guy make drinks and it honestly wasn't much different than the nights I've spent at The Merc Bar watching the bartenders make magic (and I have to say, their bartenders are TALENTED... this guy.. not so much).   Our bartender seemed like a very nice guy but honestly, he wasn't a very good speaker and he didn't even really seem that knowledgeable about booze.    The value of the class is pretty good - for $30, you get 4 drinks.  It would have been a superb deal had we been able to actually make the drinks.  And the drinks were delightful.    Our tables had brochures with drink recipes that were in the same style of things being made in class but were not what we were served.  I found this confusing.  In other classes we've done, we received handouts with the recipes that were covered.    The resort itself is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent there.  I just don't feel like we got what we paid for.  :(

This place is right next to our mechanic so it seemed an obvious choice to try for lunch after annoying adult vehicle expenses.    Inside, it's not much to look at.  But, I came the conclusion that they don't need fancypants glassware and matching chairs.    I ordered the margherita pizza - it was delicious but be warned, this is not your delicate gourmet pizza situation.  It was a lot more Papa John's than Sauce or Humble Pie.  Which isn't a bad thing - it's just good to know if you're expecting truck stop or fine dining.  My husband raved about the gnocchi and he's a tough cookie when it comes to Italian (especially since he makes his own gnocchi).  We shared the bread pudding for dessert.  Aside from the strange colored sauce (it was a yellow that is not found in nature), it was absolutely yummy.  It was the perfect amount of dense, gooey, and delicious.    Is this where you want to ask your girlfriend to marry you?  No.  Is it where you want to go for a cheap delicious meal before you elope to Vegas?  Maybe.

Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous "bitch fizz" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception.

Love this place.  Their appetizers are yummy and they have a great selection for their tasting menu.  I've been here a couple of times now and have enjoyed myself every time.  It's a great place for date night or to spend an evening with friends.  Highly recommend!

We had a groupon for the Wine & Truffle tasting.  Prior to eating and drinking, we looked around the store a bit and they seem to have a lot of unique items.    The wines were good but I was disappointed that we got half a truffle per wine sample.  They gave generous pours which was awesome but highlighted the fact that there wasn't much chocolate.    Prior to the tasting, we ordered the cheese platter.  It was tasty enough but seemed somewhat pedestrian (If I can duplicate it with a trip to the grocery store, it's pedestrian).    The live music was nice.

We came to this location shortly after it opened and it was a solid "meh" for me so I haven't been back until this past weekend.  I have to say - it has turned around!  The menu was interesting and varied.  The chopped salad is divine and is a fantastic option if you're looking for something a bit lighter.  My husband raved about his burger.  They have a wonderful list of cocktails which is always refreshing to see (I'm not so much a beer-o-phile so I appreciate the options).

After having lunch here, I'm upset at having passed by this place so often and never stopping in.  There were lots of "emergency personnel" which is generally a sign of good eats.  My lunch was delicious and the service was friendly and fast.  Looking forward to coming again!

The outside isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic!  It's New Mexican style which means you aren't going to find gooey platters of cheese.  The chips and salsa are fantastic.  I had the chicken tacos and they were divine.  The rice and beans were also delicious.  Can't wait to go back!

I would probably give this place 2.5 stars.  There were a few service hiccups that do not seem consistent with the atmosphere they're obviously seeking.  Our main entrees were brought when my husband was still eating his appetizer causing us to scramble to find room for all of the dishes.  My husband's appetizer dish (which was a long rectangular dish and not at all inconspicuous) sat ON the table until dessert dishes were cleared.  Space is at a premium here (so much so that two of our dining companions were bumped by neighboring diners and food had to be passed down the tables as the servers couldn't get to the people at the end).  It also seemed rather expensive.    The food was okay.  My salad wasn't tossed terribly well and despite the description that mentioned candied walnuts, I think I located exactly one.  My filet was quality and cooked well but someone was rather heavy-handed with the demiglace in the kitchen.  My aunt's filet was oversauced as well.  It probably wouldn't have been an issue except it was salty.  (And I LOVE salt so me describing something as salty should tell you something.)    The bread pudding was delicious although the blueberries were completely drowned out by the caramel sauce.  Overall...  eh.

This was an unexpected find!  The location is a bit difficult to locate as it's sort of "around the back" but it's cute as a button inside.    Our server was friendly and attentive.  My chicken souvlaki was delicious.  I was wishing we had room for dessert!  If I find myself in this neighborhood again,  I will definitely stop back in.

This was our second visit to Maizie's and it was generally a good experience.    We were given an estimate of a 20 minute wait for our party of 5 which ended up being a fair amount longer.  The hostess station seemed extremely unorganized and I heard other customers complaining about not being seated quickly enough.    Once we sat down, our experience was wonderful.  The appetizers were delicious - sweet potato fries with a spicy aioli and a buffalo chicken dip.  My southwest chicken salad was also a winner - the chicken was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Our table split two of the dessert specials (a warm blonde brownie with vanilla ice cream) and they too were fantastic.    Service was a tiny bit slow but it wasn't really an issue.

What a fun and funky store.  We were offered water (in REAL breakable glasses, no less) upon entry and the salesperson was very helpful and friendly.  It's effectively an artist co-op which means there is a LOT of variety and it rotates regularly.  Prices are on the spendier side but not unreasonable.  Reminds me of a bit of my favorite artist co-op in Jerome.  If you need an interesting gift or just a little something-something, you're bound to find it here.

As longtime fans of Binkley's, we've been to Cafe Bink twice now for lunch.  The service is pretty good although it is lacking compared to near spa-like atmosphere of Binkley's.  The food is excellent.  On our most recent outing here, I ordered the pasta bolognese and it was outstanding.  Who knew a meat sauce could shine like that?  And of course, the fries are required eating.  It's a fabulous alternative when my bank account shrinks in horror at another Binkley's reservation.  Wonderful job Kevin and Amy!

As others have noted, tours book up extremely fast.  We booked ours six months ago and I'd nearly forgotten about it.    Was it the most awesome thing ever?  No.  But having lived in Phoenix for 16 years and driving past the castle more times than I can count wondering what the heck it was...  it was nice to put curiosity at rest.  The tours are entertaining (and I'm not much of a history buff) and the inside of the castle is beautiful.

I've had mixed feelings about this place for a while.  On our first visit, the food was tasty but the service was terrible.  On our second visit, they were out of a lot of everything.  I had more or less written this place off.    However, in our neighborhood, restaurants are slim pickins'.  I kept seeing reviews for breakfast/brunch at Heart & Soul and decided to give it a whirl once more.    I'm glad we did.  They offer $3 mimosas on the weekends which were quite tasty (it may have been cheap bubbly but it didn't taste like it).  For those who prefer a hair of the dog, they have a bacon bloody mary that was delicious as well.  My apple pancakes were delicious - clearly homemade and freshly prepared.  I had a bite of the bacon blue pancakes (which were very interesting) as well as the crazy biscuit.   They pride themselves on their pork green chile but I found the real star to be the pork gravy.    Service was attentive and prompt.  I think we have a winner!  :)

After a long day of furniture shopping, we were need of some sustenance and relaxation.  Arrowhead Grill fit the bill.    Be warned as the drinks seems to be on the sweet side.  I asked the waitress if the margarita was really sweet (I think it's cheating if it is - good 'ritas don't need to be so sweet) and she said it wasn't.  It was one of the sweeter margaritas I had and I ended up pawning if off on the husband.    The coconut shrimp was delicious as was my steak (it's not Ruth's Chris but damn close).  I'd love to come back for the butter cake.

We've been going here for 5 years and have never had a bad experience.  The food is good, the drinks are tasty, and as someone else described, the restaurant is spacious yet intimate.    The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  The prices for the a la carte menu seem appropriate for two of a particular item but you only get one.  Also, while it says "upscale mexican food" on the door, I don't think this is accurate.  We very much enjoy the food, but it is your standard Mexican menu.  Their red sauce is delish!

Really great experience!  We were able to get a reservation the day of and chose to do the Restaurant Week menu.  The food was delicious and Christopher himself came by several times to check on us.    The cocktails were well balanced and although we didn't go to Crush Lounge, I'd definitely like to go there for drinks sometimes.  Definitely a must-do again!

A friend chose this restaurant for a pre-concert dinner.  I was surprised when we arrived at the Sheraton because I don't typically think of Sheratons as "fancy" hotels.  However, the hotel is beautiful inside and the lobby is quite high end.    It took much longer than it should have to receive our cocktails.  Our waiter explained that it was taking a long time on our drinks because they were serving a large party.  While I appreciated the explanation, it doesn't make my time or money any less valid.  If you can't serve other patrons, close the restaurant for the night.    The drinks were tasting but the size was disappointing.  A $12 non-martini cocktail served in a small juice glass...  No.    I had the herb roasted chicken which was really good but mildly disturbing because there was a bone sticking out of it (I have serious case of meat denial and do not like reminders that it was once alive... but that's my issue).  The chicken was cooked well and the flavors were tasty.  The grilled bread was also delicious as was the broccolini.    While our server was very nice, service was very slow.  It took a long time to get the check processed and we started to get nervous about missing the start of our show.    As I've said in previous reviews, there are just too many other good options downtime to come back here.  It's a shame because the food is actually quite good but the service and cocktail value needs work.

Once again, thanks to Yelp, we checked out this place Saturday evening.  If you go, definitely try the pupusas.  They are essentially a savory pancake with a filling of your choice.  They were delicious.  We also had the fried yucca which was fabulous as well.  Their pupusa plates are a steal - 3 of them for about $10.  They're large and extremely filling.   The only downside is that the service is very slow. This very much feels like a family place and if I feel like I'm getting family recipes, I'm okay with the wait.

Is Blu Burger the most amazing burger I've ever had?  No.  But, it's consistently tasty and fresh.  I love having the option of creating my own burger.    I think they ought to push the cocktails a little more.  They have a full bar but the cocktails listed on the tables are standard and boring.  I think it would be a great idea to have certain cocktails paired with particular meals.

Literally, "tucked" into a neighborhood, it would be easy to miss.  The lobster mac n' cheese was stellar as were our Dark N' Stormies.  Definitely a cute little hipster place.  Service was great and it didn't get too loud.

I write this review with the disclaimer that I'm barely a carnivore.  I'm super picky about the meat I consume (mostly that it does not qualify as "weird") and am not very flesh-venturous.    The restaurant is beautifully appointed.  While we did not sit at the bar, it looks like a great place to enjoy a happy hour.  The dining area is large and open.  As we weaved our way around the tables to the "salad" bar, it had the feel of a large wedding venue.  The salad bar was extremely varied and nice deviation from the near constant processional of meat.  There was a small salad section but many other choices - fresh mozzarella, potato salad, olives and a number of other goodies.  The yucca bread and polenta fries were fabulous.      The drinks were tasty (they make a mean caipirinha) albeit overpriced (which is to say, Scottsdale-priced).    Desserts ranged from tasty to average.  The flan and tres leches cake were well received.  The cheesecake was tasty but could have come from Costco.    I noticed they had a location in Sao Paulo, Brazil so I mentioned to a friend that we had gone there.  He had been to the Brazil location and said it was the best churrascaria he'd ever had.    So, Fogo is definitely the real deal in terms of Brazilian steakhouses.  My gentle constitution protested the next day from about 3 weeks worth of meat consumption in a few mere hours, but as I said, I'm barely a carnivore.

I expected to like this more than I did. It's a turn-off to not be allowed to get your own samples. I understand they probably do it to reduce people coming in and getting huge samples without buying anything. However, those of us who do buy something feel infantilized.   My other issue was the employee hovering while I was getting my Yogurt, like I was going to make a huge mess.  He was very polite but it was off putting.   The Yogurt was very creamy and I would have probably enjoyed the salted caramel if I hadn't recently had Zoyo's salted caramel (its knock your socks off good).  Also, the candy toppings were more or less whole which means you're having to cut up a candy bar with a plastic spoon.  No thank you.   I was looking for a snack before a doctor appointment in the area and came here based on Yelp reviews.  Don't think I'll return.

I'm a hotel whore.  Incidentally in Vegas once or twice a year, I delight in trying new hotels.  I have no loyalty to any hotel, brand or amenity.    This may have all changed.  Meeting a girlfriend in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, she chose to stay at The Aria so I stayed there too to make things easier.   Oh, the joys of a modern hotel.  Visible and easily accessible plugs on the nightstand for my phone and Kindle.  A nightstand safe for laptops that is super easy to operate.  A nightstand control panel for damn near everything in my room. Lots of nooks and crannies for storage, suitcases, etc.  Curtains that open and close at the touch of a switch.  No more fumbling with the privacy card as it's just a push of a button.  The complimentary toiletries are NICE (nicer than the ones I brought so I may be squirreling them away for home use).     I got a fantastic summer rate, they gave me a birthday room upgrade and they hotel delivered a lovely box of macarons to my room.  The room of beautifully decorated and the bed.. oh, the bed... it will swallow you whole.  I don't have plans until this afternoon so I sit cheerfully on my comfy bed, doing a bit of work and enjoying the gorgeous view.    My room is quiet and the blackout curtains do a wonderful job of letting me sleep when I want to sleep.    There are a couple areas they could improve:    Check-in was dreadfully slow.  I probably waited in line for a half hour.  (To be fair, it was exacerbated by a five hour plane delay...I was quite tired of waiting by that point.)  As it hasn't been convenient to go shopping and buy bottled water, I've been drinking water out of the tap and it's akin to Phoenix water.  I'm reluctantly staying hydrated.    The mini-fridge that is stocked to the gills with room for nothing else is irritating (although standard Vegas).  You can request another fridge be delivered to your room but that seems silly.  Just leave me a shelf.       The disinfectant they use distinctly reminds me of my great grandmother's nursing home.  It's a little off putting but only because I have that association.   I'm here one more night and it's been a lovely, lovely stay so far.  I'm trying to decide if my family would miss me if I didn't come home...

I was in the mood for a change so I made an appointment with this salon.  I saw Jessica and she was great.  She was able to match my previous color nearly perfectly and she took time to review my options.  They are competitively priced and gave me a couple of coupons for my next visit.    The salon is nice inside and easy to find.  Parking is a breeze.  I will definitely return!

It's been on my mind to try this place and when a friend invited us to a birthday party at The Clarendon, it seemed like the perfect opportunity.  The restaurant itself was quite cute.  The house margaritas are outstanding and clearly NOT from a big plastic jug labeled "Margarita Mix" (I'm talking to you Canteen Modern Tequila).  The service was a little slow but it was quite crowded and we were not in hurry.  The chips and salsa were delish but as a longtime Phoenix resident, I bristle a bit at having to pay for them.  Based on the experience of previous Yelpers, I stuck to the tacos.  My carne asada taco was delicious.  My ahi taco was awesome but I should note that it seems to be a seasonal item.  Everyone at my table was pleased with their meals.  The drink menu was extensive and this seems like a great happy hour destination.  Ole!

Great service from Scott!  A water heater in a rental property broke and he was able to get there the next day.  He also fixed a toilet issue  He was able to service our water heater the day after that and installed some extra values on our sink for easy water shut-off.  He was kind, courteous and pleasant which is unusual for service people.  He kept me updated about what was going on and how much things would cost.    My home can be a bit difficult to find and I warned him about that - he actually looked at a map BEFORE getting on the road and called me with questions.    Payment was a breeze and receipts are emailed almost immediately.  Prices seem fair and reasonable although I don't know the first thing about plumbing and what things cost.    I always appreciate hassle-free service experiences and this is definitely one of them!

I read about this place a long time ago and it was stuck in my head that it's a pizza joint.  But it's so much more!  Interesting cocktails and unique salads and sandwiches make up the eclectic menu.  The pizza IS really good though.  The margerita pizza was fantastic.  I was bummed to realize that I left my remaining portion there.    Yet another fantastic option on the Camelback Corridor.

We haven't had them out to do the job yet but I had to post because service has been stellar so far.  I called and spoke with Robert who was helpful, friendly and SEEMED TO WANT MY BUSINESS.  (Always amazes me how people advertise on Craiglist but then seem so put out when you call.)  We were trying to schedule but he was on the road and said he'd follow up on Sunday AND HE DID.    Very impressed so far!  I will update once the job is done.  I so appreciate feeling like a valued customer.  I wish more businesses would prioritize that.

We ended up here on a pub crawl and made a mental note to come back.  I'm glad we did!  The drinks are fabulous and you can't beat happy hour prices.  The sweet potato fries *are* tasty but they are far from the best thing on the menu.  My guest and I had a difficult time choosing our entrees because there were so many things that looked good.  A word to the spice sensitive - things tend to run on the spicy side here so be sure to ask your server.  We had great service and it wasn't crowded.  I'm even considering hosting my birthday dinner here.  Definitely a fun place!

If you're at a 24 hour clinic, chances are that "woo-hoo!'s" are scarce.  Our kitty was acting strangely yesterday...  very uncoordinated, glassy eyes.  Upon testing his blood sugar, we realized he was most likely in insulin shock.    We rushed him to the vet and they were absolutely wonderful.  The desk staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Before I had even put my name to paper, a tech had come over to talk to us and they whisked him back to get immediate care.  Shortly thereafter, they put us in a room and the vet came to speak with us.  Dr. Lunt was extremely thorough and very compassionate.  They wanted to keep him overnight to make sure his blood sugar returned to normal levels.  Prior to leaving, they brought him into a room with us so we could spend a little time with him before leaving.  He was pissy as all get out but calmed down with us in the room.    They invited us to call at any point in the night to check on him.  I called this morning and was put immediately on the phone with Dr. Lunt.  Again, he was very thorough and compassionate.  Our little guy is on the mend and we'll be picking him up shortly.    Having an animal in distress is incredibly stressful.  These folks know that and do everything possible to make you and your pet comfortable.  It's obvious this isn't just a job - these people love animals.  On top of that, they are conscious of costs.      If your animal is in crisis, do not hesitate and take them here.

I love love love me some raw fish but have been hesitant to try things in the North Valley.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's that extra 15 minutes from the airport?    Anyhow, great experience here last week.  Service was efficient although not overly friendly.  The miso soup was very good.  You can't beat the lunch special - 3 rolls for $13.  The downside is that there are only about 8 rolls to choose from and there are so many interesting looking rolls that aren't included in the special.    We did get the salmon sake sashimi and it was out of this world.  How I would eat to have a plate of that all to myself.    Will definitely be back.

A+ experience!  They were scheduled to arrive at my home yesterday between 3 and 5 p.m.    Around 1:30 p.m., Kelly called to let me know that it would be closer to 5 p.m. so I wouldn't have to unnecessarily wait around.  SHOCK.  STUN.  Who does that?!?!?!  Apparently, I am used to camping out at the front door waiting hours for service people.  I even had snacks and books ready.   Shortly before 5 p.m., Kelly called again to let me know they were running late and they would be at my home by 5:45 p.m.  Nearly on the nose, Freddy rang the doorbell.  He was friendly, professional, and fast.  He also apologized profusely for being late.    I'm a business person and completely understand that sometimes things take longer than expected.  I'm totally okay with someone being late as long as they keep me apprised.  Blue Chip was fantastic about that.    Now, assuming they don't spam me with phone calls (another peeve of mine), I will eagerly call them again the next time I am victim to a landscaping company not properly securing their load on the freeway.

I really, really wanted to like this practice and the doctor.  She specializes in two things that have plagued me all my life - allergies and migraines.  While I did get some help from her, I went back to my primary physician as soon as my insurance changed.  The office *never* runs on time.  I'm usually called back to the room on time only to be left to stew for 30 or 40 minutes.  If I liked/trusted Dr. Harter, I could deal.  However, she spends the entire appointment typing into a computer and suggests medications that I am already on.  Hello?  You've been staring at my file the entire appointment.  How do you not see that I'm already taking xxx medication?    I am nearly a year into the allergy drops program they offer.  Unfortunately, they make me come in for an appointment every time I need a new maintenance bottle.  Having to go there just for that raises my blood pressure because I dislike it so much.

I must preface this review by saying that we had a very different expectation of what this place would be compared to what it was.  It was recommended to us by friends and was described as a "cider bar."  We imagined cider tasting, pub food, etc.    It is much more friendly lunch spot than gastropub.  That being said, the staff was extremely friendly and welcomed us like we were expected.  They currently have one cider available but are working on more.  The food was very, very good.  We shared a pretzel and it was clearly fresh (I always worry about being tricked and getting a frozen Super Jumbo pretzel).  My caprese sandwich was delicious.  They had a wonderful menu of homemade sodas, sundaes and floats which we didn't sample (but would like to next time).    Super friendly folks and definitely a must-do if you're in Old Town.

After an extremely rough day of our culinary tour/pub crawl, we need a place to sit, collect our thoughts, and continue eating and drinking.  While I was trolling yelp for a place to go, this popped up.  Several of the items on the menu are the same as The Arrogant Butcher so I put on my detective shoes (translation: used the internet on my phone) to discover that yes indeed, this is a Fox restaurant.    Oddly enough, the two items mentioned are the only duplicates from Arrogant Butcher.  The menu is casual gastropub fare and the drink list is fantastic.  Our waiter was attentive and kept us mired in food and drink.  The pretzel bites are a must order (here or at Arrogant Butcher).  We also ordered a meat and cheese plate - yum!  Drinks were inventive and tasty.  Dessert was delicious as well although I was a tiny bit disappointed in the apple monkey bread.  It was good but lacking a little something-something.    The outside patio is lovely.  I recommend going on a Saturday afternoon when it's not terribly crowded.    Bueno!

This is definitely a hidden neighborhood gem.  It reminds me of Haji Baba in Tempe - part grocery store, part delicious eats.    The gentleman behind the counter (presumably the owner?) was extremely friendly and welcoming.    We ordered the chicken kabobs and the vegetarian platter which included hummus, falafel and the eggplant dip which I won't even attempt to spell.  The chicken was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  The peppers that accompanied it were cooked to perfection as well.  The hummus was tahini-rich which makes it a winner for me.  They top it with a spicy green sauce which I thought was an interesting twist but the husband did not care for it too much.  The falafel and eggplant dip were delicious as well.  We ended our meal with baklava.  I don't know if it's made in house (we think maybe not) but either way, it's delicious.    If you need to stock up on tahini, this is the place to do it.  It's fun to poke around in the grocery area while waiting for your food.    Wonderful experience and we will defiitely be back!

Until past weekend, I was a catering virgin (as in, never hired a real-deal caterer before).  I turned to my trusty Yelp for advice and contacted several caterers before settling on Amici.  All in all, it was a great experience.    Getting started with a little tricky because I contacted Lori and Scott the day before they left for vacation.  It was not ideal timing but once they were back in town several days later, we got everything squared away.    We were catering our 15th wedding anniversary party.  Lori was great about suggesting menu items to keep the costs down and help us get the most bang for our buck.  She also brought up a number of things to make sure I had them covered (which I appreciate as this was all rather complicated - more so than I expected).    They arrived early to set everything up and the food looked great.  I got compliments all evening about how great the food was.  I wasn't crazy about the presentation being on plastic trays but it is my fault for not inquiring about that beforehand.      We also hired a bartender through Amici.  He arrived on time and worked with my husband to learn the cocktails we had created for the evening.  He was a very fun and competent bartender.  We paid to have him for 5 hours (I thought) but he left after 4 so I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on our part or theirs.   The party ended up being a lot more work than I anticipated and having the food catered made it that much easier.  I would definitely work with them again.

I spoke with both Lori and the owner of the bartending company.  Both were extremely apologetic about the mix-up with the timing and that speaks volumes about the integrity of both businesses.    If the bartender leaving an hour earlier than expected was the worst thing that happened before, during, and after this party, I'd say we did alright.  ;)     Many thanks (again) to Amici for awesome food and fabulous customer service.

Dresses for $15?  Are you kidding?  Most of my new summer dresses cost that or less from Ross and they're brand new.  These are absolutely NOT thrift store prices.

I am ex Wells Fargo customer.  Years ago, they started charging me for a billpay service that had previously been free.  I called to cancel the service only to find they charged me a fee for speaking to someone to cancel the service.  Needless to say, I took my money elsewhere and haven't looked back.    On occasion, I have checks from Wells Fargo and as there is a location near my house, it is convenient to stop there and cash them.  Up until today, they have been cool about it and haven't harassed me too much about becoming a customer.    They've followed suit with Chase and now make you go through this ridiculous "check verification" process.  The teller sends me over to another teller where I wait in line behind Cowboy Bob who is talking incessantly about his grandchildren.  I wait and I wait and I wait.  About 15 minutes go by and I start attempting to telekinetically staple the tellers to their desks.  One of the tellers notices that I am getting angry and may possibly have a gun in my purse so he sends another teller up to help me.    As the guy is verifying the check, he asks me if this is a business check.  I say "It's just a personal check."  He says "No, what I mean is did someone pay you for a service?"    What I want to say:   "Yes, I am a very expensive prostitute."    What I do say:   "It's just a personal check."    He then asks me if I'm happy with my bank.  I say that I am and he proceeds to ask me why I didn't take my check there.  I reply, "Because I felt like bringing it here."    We do have a local bank that we don't love.  I MIGHT have been open to coming back at some point but if this is how they treat their non-customers, I don't have a lot of hope for how they treat their actual customers.  I would hate to think that someone who has every right to cash a check that I wrote them would be put through this kind of hassle.    I left before actually stapling a teller to a desk.  This is probably the best possible outcome.

I had a fantastic experience here and would not hesitate to come here again.    I looked at the artist portfolios online and chose Nicole.  They actually let you make appointments with the artist which is huge for me.  My past experiences have been that shops don't let you do that (presumably because so many people don't show up) and as I don't live near anything, "stop by when you're in the area" doesn't really work for me.    Tattoo shops can be intimidating.  This place isn't at all.  The waiting area has a very arty boudoir feel to it and the staff were very friendly.  I met with Nicole and we went over some ideas for my piece.    Two weeks later, I arrived for my ink.  I loved the design that Nicole did.  I asked to make a few small changes to the design and the orientation and she was fantastic about it.  The color pops and the detail work is incredible.  And, touch-ups for the first year are free!    I loved my experience here and would go back again in a heartbreak.  And in fact, the wheels are already spinning about my next piece...

My allergist recommended Dr. Weiner because I've had such severe issues with my sinuses.  He is very knowledgeable and has me on a regimen that is actually making a difference.  It's also easy to get an appointment with him and you can book with ZocDoc.  Win!

Great experience here!  The salesman talked more than I prefer but he did give us a good education on beds.  When the bed we wanted wasn't available, they upgraded us at no additional charge to next best model.  When the bed was delivered, the box springs and mattress were so high, we had a Princess and the Pea situation.  They kindly exchanged the box springs for a bunky board that is more expensive. There were definitely a few hiccups during the process but they addressed every issue.

Great experience thus far.  I saw Dr. Cook for my teeth cleaning and to give a cavity filled.  The office was efficient, organized and prompt.  I think each time I was in, I was in the chair by my appointment time.  As I have things to do too, I always appreciate when medical offices are respectful of patient time.    Prices are reasonable, especially if you don't have dental insurance.

This is an easy low-stress chiropractic facility.  I'm not going to lie - I was a little dubious when I read some of other services they offer.  But Dr. Stephanie is great.  She spent considerably more time with me on the first appointment.  They do appointments and walk-ins.  And very reasonable for an adjustment!

I'll be very honest.  The produce here is pornographic.  Brightly colored, clearly fresh and fragrant, it looks like it belongs in a commercial and I want to know how to get my hands on my own sexy produce.    Definitely one of those hipster our-forks-are-vegan places but it doesn't matter.  The food is terrific and the dishes are flavorful, creative and healthy.  Save room for the x-rated dessert case.  Even if you're full, you'll want to take something home.    It's a shame I live on the other side of town but I could be easily convinced to swing back by for a jaunt to the Fruit/Veggie Red Light District.

IHOP is cheap, reliable and tasty.  When I want pancakes, I usually want IHOP pancakes.  We brought a friend visiting from Brazil and he very much enjoyed it.  Red velvet pancakes are not so much an international phenomenon.  ;)

An unexpected surprise!  We were taking a friend out for her birthday and thanks to Yelp (again!), we discovered this place.  A rather authentic European bistro in Glendale... GLENDALE... of all of places.    The food was phenomenal.  The garlic bread tartin, the fondue, the crepes, the salted caramel fondue... all of it.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.    We chatted extensively with our waiter and also a gentleman who I believe is the owner.  He was very friendly and had a great sense of humor.    We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back!

This was a long overdue Christmas gift that we finally cashed in this past weekend.  All in all, it was a great experience.  Although I've lived in AZ for 14 years, some of the history in Scottsdale was interesting.    We chose to turn it into something of a pub crawl which MAY have added to our enjoyment.  The staff at each stop were very welcoming and inviting.  They also did a great job (mostly) of getting our drinks to us quickly.  At times, it felt a little rushed but I understand that our tour guide was having to herd cats from one location to the next.    I am definitely interested in doing the dinner tour sometime.

My PCP recommended Dr. Valerie Sorkin-Wells at this practice about two years ago and they're are wonderful.  Dr. Sorkin-Wells is extremely personable and I feel lucky to have her as my GYN.  This office "gets it" which is why you get a piece of chocolate on the exam table before your well-woman appointment.  I also like that they do a lot of testing in-house.  I am able to get ultrasounds and blood draws done there instead of making another trip to a lab.

Great little place!  They have the brilliant idea of a cup divider.  It makes it easier to get non-complementary flavors since you know they be touching.    Yogurt flavors were good and they had a great selection of toppings.    The only part about this place I didn't like is that although the machines are self-serve, the owner gets the samples for you.  I'm grown... I can handle my own samples, thank you very much.

What a great little place!  I don't think we would have ever discovered it without Yelp.  We had an hour to kill between dinner and meeting up with friends.  It's a cool, sexy little place tucked away in a strip mall.  I really enjoyed the music they were playing (Zeppelin, if I recall) and it was at good volume - loud enough to enjoy but not so loud I couldn't hear my husband.     They have an extensive and interesting drink menu.  I highly recommend the Maple Bar.    I would definitely love to come back when we have a bit more time.

We were killing some time before attending an event downtown and happened upon this cute little shop.  They have a case of yummy goodies that beg to be eaten.  It's cute and clean inside and the staff were extremely friendly.  They do not have a huge selection but I don't find that to be a turn-off because it ups the chances that what you see is fresh.  I hope they stick around!

My friend brought in Short Leash to cater her wedding reception and it was a great time!  They were friendly and fast.  I had heard about the infamous Bear Dog, which has BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, peanut butter and Cracker Jax so I had to get it.  It was surprisingly delicious.  I'm not sure the amount of drugs or alcohol that had to be consumed to come up with this concoction but I'm glad they did.    A must-try for any self respecting foodie!

When you add booze to something out of the ordinary, my experience is that it's either overpowering or you can't even taste it.  Lee's gets it right - the slight edge of the alcohol mixed expertly with the flavors - fantastic.  The caramel pecan tequila might just be the tastiest thing in Old Town.

I really want to like this place because we have so little in the way of restaurants in this neighborhood (there are THREE, count 'em three Ray's Pizzas within about 7 miles of Carefree Highway so you see my issue).    It's a really nice space but the inside needs renovation.  I was noting scrapes and chunks of wall missing nearly the entire length of the outward facing wall.  I've had a salad that was decent, a hamburger that was terrible, and pancakes that were tasty (although I'm pretty sure they were from a mix - still, they were fluffy and cooked well).   The menu seems to lack direction and cohesion.  My husband and I were discussing whether this was a chef with a vision or someone who thought "Hey!  I can run a restaurant."  We're pretty sure it's the latter.  It has beautiful views...  shame that the same cannot be said for the inside.

We were encouraged to give them another shot and I'm glad we did.  They've reconfigured the inside and it looks like some renovations are still happening.  It still has a ways to go but it's looking much better and more like a "real" restaurant.    The food has improved as well.  The AZ tots are tasty.  My buffalo chicken wrap hit spot and the side of peppercorn sweet potato fries were yummy as well.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his chicken corn chowder soup.  He raved about the mashed potatoes but found the chicken fried chicken a bit tough.    We will be back!

The early signs weren't good.  Iffy Yelp reviews, dead on a Thursday evening, tucked into a strip mall in WASP-y Anthem...  But I had it bookmarked so we gave it a shot and I'm glad we did.    The service was great.  Our server and another gentleman (the owner, perhaps?) checked on us regularly and were extremely friendly.  Dubiously, I ordered the tilapia and it was exceptional.  My companions greatly enjoyed their meals as well (osso bucco and more tilapia).  Were I not an adult with a driver's license and a mortgage, I might have licked my plate clean.    For dessert, we had the caramel cheesecake and the tiramisu.  The cheesecake was a little disappointing as it was essentially plain cheesecake with caramel sauce on it.  The tiramisu was quite tasty.    The place is very cute inside although the giant TV's above the bar look a little out of place.  We will definitely return.

Thrift store meets artist co-op = fabulous!  What a great idea.  I scored a nifty shirt for the husband for $2 and best friend found a super cute top for $4.  Plan to meander - even though it's a small-ish store, there's lots to see.

I saw Justin Beckett speak at the local Ted conference in 2011 so his restaurant has been on my radar for a while.  Finally got the chance to try it last night and I have to say, it's a winner!    They have a lovely menu of craft cocktails which I'm loving more and more these days.  There's an art to bar-tending but there's a magical art to craft cocktails.  My companion ordered The Farmhand and I ordered The Palmaire.  Both were delicious but The Farmhand was really something special, particularly if you like gin.    We started with the mac n' cheese.  Definitely get the pancetta on it.  Without it, I daresay it might be underseasoned.  It was delicious!  Definitely not your mom's bowl o' Kraft.  Creamy bechamel sauce and house-made pasta.    I rarely order pasta when I'm eating out but our waiter assured us that theirs is house-made so I ordered the sausage pasta.  I rarely voluntarily consume sausage but for some reason, this dish kept calling out to me and I'm so glad it did.  The pasta was fantastic and the sausage was outstanding.  I am generally dubious of tube-meat but there was not a tube in sight!  They source their sausage locally and it lacks the round Stepford shape of most sausages (which I admittedly find mildly disturbing).  It came with a rich tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes and whole cloves of roasted garlic.     My companion ordered the special which was Shepard's pie and he enjoyed it immensely.    For dessert, he ordered the fig/pecan pie with the ice cream on the side (he is lactose intolerant which is sad for him but happy for me as I often inherit his dairy castaways).  He said the pie was wonderful and I can personally attest to the fact that this ice cream might have been the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  If ice cream and cream cheese had a really shady tryst in an expensive hotel, this would be the love child.  It was ridiculous.  Thankfully, there was only one scoop because I would have kept eating it, warning messages from my stomach be damned.    I ordered the bacon s'mores which were fantastic.  The bacon is chocolate covered and well done = WIN.  (Recent forays into bacon-dessert have left me disappointed.  Chewy bacon with sweetness is no bueno.)  The marshmallow is clearly home-made and the additions of caramel and peanut butter were yummy.    The service was great.  The level of service was a little surprising given the casual-ness of the restaurant.  Our water glasses were constantly refilled, silverware quickly replaced, plates immediately taken away - pretty fabulous.    The menu is gluten-free and vegetarian friendly.    Great dinner out and I can wait to go back!

We ate here for the second last night and once again, quality food and service.  The menu is heavy on pork (which I generally eat reluctantly) but they are able to create magic with that oh-so-dirty animal.    Just go.

Excellent experience from start to finish.  I requested a quote online and received a call within a few hours.  We scheduled an appointment for official measurements and to go through carpet samples on Thursday and the new carpet was installed on Monday.  The installers were friendly and simply rolled with the fact that there was a dead vehicle in the driveway limiting walk-space and access.  Even though we opted to move our furniture ourselves (to save a few bucks), they offered to help us move any large pieces back before they left.  We love our new carpet and I will not hesitate to call them again.

To be fair, this was a pit stop in between movies at the Esplanade.  I had the Esplanade margarita which is a glass of spicy heaven.  Jalapeno infused vodka with a cumin-salt rim?  You had me at hello.

We did their "Girls' Night" Deal Chicken deal and it was a great time.  It was just the three of us plus our instructor so it was a very intimate setting.  Our instructor was very patient with us and helped us redo things when needed.    There are certain "processes" that seem like magic to me and jewelry is one of them.  It was neat to learn how it all goes together.  I am not really a handy person and I had no problem following the directions.    Like others have mentioned, it is a bit difficult to find.  The studio is actually in the back of the building is there's some new age/energy healing something or other facing the street.    Great place - I'd love to come back here for another ladies' outing.

I can't speak to the ambiance because a friend brought take-out.  My turkey burger was delicious and my companions enjoyed their sandwiches (tuna melt and pulled pork).  My fries might have been tasty had they not been limp and sad (in comparison to the turkey burger which was still quite warm).  Our side of pita and hummus was disappointing.  The pita was so old it had turned into extra chewy lavosh.  Eating one piece gave my jaws a workout.  The hummus itself was super extra mediocre.  There was something off about it.    I may try Tryst again but I certainly won't make a special effort.

Really beautiful bar but the acoustics of the hotel make it extraordinarily loud.  Our chocolate martinis were superb!    My friend had come here the previous weekend and they made her sign a paper promising she would spend $30.  Never heard of that before but that would put me off a bit.

7 Santas walk into a bar on a chilly Scottsdale evening...  It was post-Santarchy (our yearly Santa pub crawl).  We were tired, hungry and needed a little unwinding before shedding our Santa gear.    It's a pretty upscale place and I worried we'd be out of place in our Christmas cheer but they were extremely friendly and showed us to a table immediately.  The late night menu was fairly small but incredibly diverse.  Biscuits and gravy, porridge with fruit, nuts and pork, flatbread with hummus and tatziki...  The food was delicious.  So much so that we stole a "regular" dinner menu from a nearby table to check it out.  Looks like a winner.  It was a great place to relax and recover from a raucous evening.  We will be back soon during regular dinner hours.

We came back for dinner on Friday evening and it was everything I hoped it would be.   If you're an alcoholic...err... "alcohol aficionado", this is the place for you.  They offer barrel aged cocktails which is a truly unique experience.  They're a bit spendy at regular price but if you go during "Social Hour", they're half price and a steal (note to CPH: I appreciate not being forced to be happy.  Thanks for validating the preferences of pissy people everywhere.)  The term "craft cocktails" is starting to go the way of  sun-dried tomatoes (sad and overused), but currently there isn't a better description and this is definitely a destination for a twist on the sauce.  If my husband were granted full access to their bar and nifty ingredients, I might never see him again.  (But granted, it's been a good run.)    We ordered the mac n' cheese, chicken and waffle, and crab cakes for appetizers.  All were fantastic.  I thought the chicken and waffle was a strange offering but an app but it works.  For din-din, our table had the short ribs, filet, duck, and meatloaf.  Six loud tipsy people were quiet for maybe an entire minute which should tell you something.  Desserts were an exercise in competitive eating but we managed.  Our table had the pumpkin bread pudding, apple pie and dream pudding.  YUM.  We then accomplished a gastronomic feat by indulging in their house-made egg nog.  It was a thick, creamy, delicious glass of shame.        The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was friendly, funny and engaging.  They did a wonderful job of taking care of us without hovering.    I'm not the biggest fan of Old Town thanks to the douche bag/Ax factor but this is definitely a compelling reason to make my way through guys in too tight t-shirts who say "dude" excessively.

If I could add fireworks and shooting stars to this review, I would.  These guys saved the evening last night for my friend's birthday.    After a scheduling snafu at The Blue Hound, The Arrogant Butcher graciously accepted our party of 20.  I was dubious about how the service would be due to the large group, but they exceeded my expectations.  We had a dedicated server who was extremely nice and resembled a cheery Christmas Hobbit.  Drinks came out fairly quickly and after a short wait at the bar, we were shown to a private dining room.    The have a really adventurous cocktail menu so if you're feeling brave, give it a go.  Bring your smartphone as you may have to google many of the ingredients (I enjoy exposure to new things so this is definitely a plus for me).    The pretzel fondue appetizer is heaven on earth encased in doughy salty cheesy goodness.  The chicken stroganoff was pretty fantastic as well and they get extra points for house made pasta.  I found it odd but charming that the menu listed "frozen peas."  (More points for honesty!)  My dining companions seemed very pleased with their meals and one person was especially enthusiastic about the mussels and oysters.    Desserts were fantastic as well.  The warm peanut butter cup is nothing short of amazing.  It's the kind of thing you would say is "just okay" in order to avoid sharing.  The salted caramel pudding was delicious as well.  (And if you all could turn that salted caramel pudding into bread pudding, I will personally head up a new religion devoted to it.)    I learned about this restaurant a couple of years ago at the Devoured event and it's been on my to-do list.  Although we didn't set out to dine here last night, I'm certainly glad we did.  Thank you Arrogant Butchers!

Another large birthday group and another fantastic evening.  Once again, we had Teddy and he rocked our socks.  Food and drink were served expeditiously despite the large group.  Filet was fantastic and the drink of the week (Ruby Red) should be a staple on the cocktail menu.  It's literally a glass of yum.  The blueberry cheesecake was divine and I was a tiny bit sorry that I shared instead of ordering my own.    Well done, butchers, well done.

I live about 45 minutes from AB so I'm not exactly "in the neighborhood."  Yet, we end up there more times than I can count.  And why is that?    The service is fantastic.  The drinks (especially the drinks of the week) are extremely tasty and it's just an all around good time.  We went there last night after a less than amazing experience across the street at the Bitter & Twisted Cocktail lounge.  Our awesome server (I can't remember her name but she looks like Carrie from Mythbusters) smoothed over our rough experience and was present without being too present.  It's kind of like going to your best friend's house - comfy and fun.

Two words: African lobster.  I didn't know it was a thing but it is and you need to find it as soon as possible.  It was a special and I don't know how long they'll have it but it's worth asking before you go.  The husband, who thinks lobsters are disgusting sea roaches, even liked it.  Drinks and service were excellent.    We arrived early with plans to have a drink at bar before our reservation.  Unfortunately, the bar was full and they were kind enough to seat us a bit early so we could get started on cocktails.    The brussel sprouts are delicious as were the desserts.    Parking at the Scottsdale Quarter is pretty much a nightmare all the time so make life easy and plan to valet.    We were seated in the "room" just off the bar and at times, the band was way too loud.  It was difficult to have a conversation.

We came here before a concert - what a great little place!  Located inside the Westin, it's a hip funky boutique restaurant with an emphasis on Spanish cuisine.  They have a large selection of tapas and if you want to make a meal out of tapas, order at least 2 or 3.    The drinks were inventive and tasty.  Our cocktails came with bleu cheese stuffed olives and the waitress was kind enough to bring us a couple extra.  The little jar of mushrooms and goat cheese was divine.  The beef empanadas were moist and cooked perfectly.  The shrimp tacos were superb.    Had we not been a bit pressed for time, I would have liked to stay for dessert.

This place has been on my radar for a while now and I was able to meet a girlfriend for dinner there last night.  The patio is fantastic and I look forward to enjoying a cocktail or two out there once the heat subsides.  All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly.  Shortly after I put my name in for a table, a gentleman brought me an unsolicited glass of ice water.  I love little touches like that!    It is a bit loud inside but it seemed to quiet down a bit after the initial dinner rush.  I had the fatoosh salad which was delightful.  I added the grilled chicken which was cooked and seasoned wonderfully.    A few other reviews complained about the music but I rather enjoyed the eclectic mix.  Nothing like being mid-bite and suddenly remembering high school.    The other reviewers are correct - just do the complimentary valet.  The parking lot is wonky and it's so much easier to part with a same tip.  I should note the valets were also extremely friendly.    All in all, a great experience and I can't wait to go back.

I'm not going to lie.  My standards for comedy clubs are kind of low.  As Improv patrons for years, we've gotten used to a certain level of mediocrity.    A group of us bought tickets for the Joe Rogan show and one of our friends discovered the VIP dinner package - for $60 per two people, we got an appetizer to share, entrees and a dessert to share.  Best of all, fantastic seats!    The food was surprisingly good.  The pretzels were tasty and my chicken bowl seasoned well.  The chocolate cake was slightly dry but still good.  And the drinks were well made.    I look forward to returning.

There are two things you need for this restaurant: reservations and a sense of adventure.  I'm an avid sushi connoisseur but I'll be the first to admit the tasting menu pushed my culinary boundaries.    An extensive sake menu is available and they serve each bottle in a nifty little box of ice to keep it cold.    Service was exceptional and they were quick to answer questions, repeat things, etc.  They were also extremely diligent about accommodating several food issues in our group (dairy and gluten).    The food was exceptional.  Mind you, I didn't love everything that was put in front of me (and just between you and I, there were a few things I couldn't bring myself to try) but the preparation was awe-inspiring.     If you're a fan of things that swim or just eke along underwater, come here.

Our elliptical was making strange noises and not operating smoothly, so I gave these guys a call.  My message was returned with an hour by a very nice man named Genady.  He asked me several questions about the elliptical and what it was doing.  I got the distinct impression that he really knew his stuff (although, to be fair, you could probably impress me with a technical description of a pencil sharpener).  We scheduled an appointment.  He called the day before our appointment to let me know he was in our area and would be available if it was convenient for us.  I was away for the afternoon but my husband was home.  He praised Genady highly and Genady taught him a few things about how our elliptical works.  We are very pleased and will call them again with any future issues.

What a great venue!  Saw Charli XCX there last week and it was my first time.  It is REALLY easy to get a drink and they make good drinks.  There's a cordoned off area in front of the stage that is accessible to anyone not currently in possession of alcohol.  There are bleacher-style seats in back if your tootsies get tired.  And FOOD (real food - not concession food) available.  Looking forward to coming back.

I was dubious about going here because the previous inhabitant (Ketzal) was so terrible.  However, I'm pleased to report that it has made a great recovery!  The decor in this place is BRIGHT.  Bring your shades and perhaps wear black and white so you can look at something else occasionally.    Contrary to other reviews, I thought the salsa was delicious.  It was just spicy enough and the chips were clearly made in house.  Both husband and I were pleased with our meals and we will definitely be back.  It's great to have a Mexican place in the area.  (I know that technically El Encanto Dos in "in the area" and in fact, I live a mile from it but putting gobs of orange cheese on things does not make it ethnic or appetizing in any way.)

We did the gin mixology class and I have to say that Travis (our bartender/cocktail historian/overall creator of awesomeness in a glass) is a rock star.    The handouts were great.  They provided a great history of gin along with information about a number of the shots we tasted.  They were also chock full of recipes.    The drinks he made for the class were fabulous.  We lingered a bit post-class for munchies and more cocktails.  He makes a very mean lemon drop.    He is extremely knowledgeable and obviously has a love of his craft.    It was a wonderful Sunday afternoon and we look forward to returning.

I'm not vegetarian but I'm vegetarian friendly.  I'm no stranger to faux meats and tofu.  I've had the "chicken" wings a number of times thanks to friends but had never eaten at the restaurant.    I was slightly dubious about ordering the Calexico burger but I was glad I did.  The patties were described as "vegan" but as far as I'm concerned, they were made of magic.  For you Midwesterners, they reminded me those wafer-thin steakburgers you get at Steak N' Shake.  Delicious!  The fries were tasty but nothing special.  The lemonade was also quite tasty and not too sweet.

The only thing I don't like about this place is the name.  The name is a bit cheesy and hard to remember.    The food was absolutely excellent.  The hummus is heavy on lemon (my favorite) has some texture to it.  The chicken tacos were superb as was the organic apricot ale.  The gluten free chocolate cake was like a large slice of ganache.    The portions are extremely generous and our server was very helpful.  I just wish I lived a little closer.  :)

I live really far from this part of town so it's been a struggle to get here.  We finally made it and I'm glad we did.  The restaurant is hip and laid-back.  We didn't sit in the patio but I noticed it was spacious and open to dogs - kind of like someone's back yard.    My cider (from The Cider Mill) was DELICIOUS as were my fish tacos.  We shared the pumpkin cheesecake and that was yummy too.  This seems like to perfect spot to drink a lazy Saturday afternoon away.  I look forward to coming back.

We wandered over here after dinner.  I've wanted to check out The Sagauro for ages and I'm happy to report that it's just as funky, fun, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse-esque as I expected.    Old Town Whiskey is cute and cozy.  Lots of large couches for lounging and a beautiful patio and fireplace outside.  If you're a whiskey aficionado (or are married to one as I am), this is a fabulous place to go.  Three of us opted for spiked milkshakes, one of us did a scotch flight, and the other did an old school manhattan.  We were all pleased.    Service was a bit slow but you could also argue that it was "relaxed."  The menu looked tasty and I'd like to come back for dinner.

The Naranja Roja margarita is a sweet yet spicy concoction (don't let anyone try yours as you might not get it back) that perfectly blends heat and sweet.  The nachos are as big as your head (well, almost) and the steak is brilliantly seasoned.  My chicken tacos were tasty although some of the chicken was unfortunately chewy.  My husband ordered the mushroom flat-bread featuring huitlacoche (corn fungus, for the uninitiated) and it was very odd but delicious.  Great little patio for peep-watching at the Scottsdale Civic Center.

We ended up here thanks to fabulous Yelpers and once again, you all know what you're talking about!    My ahi sandwich was yummy although it could have been cooked a teensy tiny bit less.  The jalepeno cheddar grits were to die for although I didn't taste any jalepeno.  Drinks are definitely strong so beware if you're imbibing.  We shared key lime pie for dessert which was also tasty.    Service was quick, attentive and friendly.  I don't get to this area that often but I would definitely come here again.

Squeaky orthotics and foot discomfort prompted me to seek out this office in order to get my orthotics replaced.  It was a great experience from beginning to end.  I got an appointment quickly, was fitted for my orthotics on the same appointment, and came back a few weeks later to pick them up.  They were also kind enough to find out the most cost effective option for me (going through insurance vs. not going through insurance).      I saw Dr. Whitney and she was extremely personable.  I can't yet speak to the quality of the new orthotics because I just got them but so far, so good!

Way better than what I expected!  It's three floors of conspiracy, blood and bootlegging.  Parts of it are graphic so if you're squeamish, you may want to pass on the crime scene photos.  It could not be in a more apropos location than Vegas.    I got $2 off for checking in with Yelp.  It's a nice distraction from the casinos.

Super cute cafe in an out-of-the-way location.  I ordered a turkey wrap and while the wrap itself was really basic, it was delicious.  Very fresh ingredients eliminated the necessity for fancy-pants-ness.  My only complaint was that my chai was so sweet that I wasn't able to drink it.    As other reviews have mentioned, it was quite empty so I hope the word gets out.  Or not...  :)

I can't tell you the number of times that I've wanted to partake in happy hour but the bar tables are all taken while the rest of the restaurant is nearly empty and the hostess looks at me with an awkward smile.  Annoying.      Such an occasion happened earlier this week and the hostess promptly grabbed the happy hour menu and seated us a table-table.  High points for that one.    Drinks are delicious and I highly recommend the cucumber jalapeno margarita.  They bring a neat little array of sauces and spices for the chips.  My vampire taco was delicious.    Great experience and I will definitely return!

Great experience!  The grilled shrimp tacos were divine and I thoroughly enjoyed the mac n' cheese.  (One note for the chef - the bleu cheese was a bit overpowering.  The dish could either use less or just sprinkle a bit on top.)  Service was fast and friendly.

As a Midwestern ex-pat, I am overjoyed to have found a local option to replace my beloved Steak N' Shake.  There's just nothing like a good steakburger.  I had your basic cheeseburger on an egg bun and it was delicious.  I also tried the salted caramel shake and it was tasty but not outstanding.  Hubby's chocolate shake had a strange flavor to it.  We did not sample the fries but I will be back!

We dined here this past weekend and took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu.    All in all, it was a good experience but there were a few hiccups.   The deviled egg appetizer is divine and not to be missed.  The VIP cocktail (which I think is just infused vodka) is delicious.  My filet was cooked very well and the roasted corn grits were phenomenal.    The hot fudge sundae was one of the poorest excuses for a dessert that I've seen in a while.  The ice cream was high quality but I did not spy so much as a thimble-ful of the salted caramel that is promised.  Also, I think the "hot fudge" is Hershey's chocolate sauce which is a no-no in my book.  We were seated right next to the pass so I saw that three hot fudge sundaes sat there for quite some time before they were delivered to us.  We also had to specifically ask for the restaurant week menus which felt odd.      I think it's priced a bit on the high side but perhaps if more restaurants move back into the Esplanade, they will be a little more competitive.

Last night was our second visit and I am impressed (which is somewhat difficult to do).  We dined on the upstairs patio and it's a fun little place to hang out.    The drinks were creative and interesting.  The Camelback Cooler is a fun take on a margarita (who knew cayenne and sugar got along so well?).  My table had the sesame ahi, meatloaf and stroganoff.  All were delicious.  For dessert, we had the lemon cake, nutella bread pudding and adult milkshake - all fabulous.  (At this point, we have more than corrected for the pathetic sundae that was served during restaurant week.)    The service was attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  Despite the emphasis on cow, it's definitely NOT just a steakhouse.  Go get your yum on!

Most of the reviews I've read for this chain are mixed and I have to agree.  There were some great deals yet prices on other things were just okay.  The produce was not appealing at all.  If you're willing to hunt for bargains, you could probably do pretty well here.  I don't think I will make this part of my regular shopping.    NOTE: They do not accept credit cards.  Cash or debit only.

What a fabulous place.  I love the interior design - clean and simple without feeling plain.  The atmosphere easily suits a romantic dinner or meeting the girls for happy hour.    The drink menu is a thing of beauty. Clearly a lot of thought went into creating these cocktails and that's evident in how they taste.    They have a tasting course option and that's the way to go here.  Portions are smaller and you'll be able to try a bit of everything.    Service was excellent.  Our server was friendly and attentive without hovering or whisking the plates away too early.    I look forward to coming back!

Great food and drinks!  The service was a bit slow but our waitress was extremely nice and the place was packed.  My burger was well prepared and delicious.  The fries are tasty and the sweet potato tater tots are interesting (eat 'em with the spicy ketchup).  It's quite loud but it's a great atmosphere.

My girlfriend wanted to celebrate her birthday here and made dinner reservations for a party of 20.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, she discovered that they had reserved the front lounge area, which was a nice area, but with coffee tables and couches, not conducive to a sit-down dinner.    I wasn't privy to all of the conversations that went on between her and the manager but there was a pretty serious miscommunication about whether we were having dinner or just drinks and appetizers.    Meanwhile, the group is gathering in the lobby/lounge area which would have been a really fantastic time to send a server over for drink orders.  Nope.  Nothing.  A large group with cash?  Really?  Really.  They let us stand there aimlessly until the manager called a neighboring restaurant to see if they could accommodate us.  (And I know most of us were a little bewildered dealing with the Esher-esque parking situation and could have really used a drink.    The decor was cute and the menu was interesting but the lack of customer service was so off-putting that we will not likely end up here intentionally.

My last experience here was FAR more positive than my first.  I was seated promptly and the waitress made a point of asking if we were going to the concert at Talking Stick.  She wanted to make sure our food order wasn't behind a large party so we wouldn't be late - love that!    The cocktails were delicious and my pasta was fabulous.  Had we not had to get to a show, I might have liked to linger for perhaps another cocktail and maybe dessert.

I kept hearing about this place and finally made it there yesterday.  It's like Claire's for grown-ups.  It is THE place for accessories.  If they don't have it, you don't need it.  Prices are very reasonable as well.    My only criticism would be about the purses...  They had a big selection but the sizes seemed to be a clutch or a giant hobo bag.  Not much in between.

I've heard great things about Lustre Bar and have always wanted to go.  My parents were in town for the holiday and after dinner at The Arrogant Butcher (always a favorite), we headed up to Lustre.    The ambiance is great although it definitely strikes me as more of a summer/warm weather destination.  The drinks were disappointing to say the least.  My husband ordered a Manhattan and received an Old Fashioned.  My friend ordered a cider that never arrived.  The drink menu was very interesting the execution was lacking.   Definitely a bummer.

We stumbled on this joint quite by accident, after a tasty lunch at Hula's.  This may possibly be the best frozen yogurt I've ever had.  We discussed the possibility that maybe it's ice cream in disguise... and if that's the case, I'm happy to live the lie.   The salted caramel is AMAZING.  I love salted caramel but find generally that's lacking.  These folks nailed it.  The froyo is creamy, delicious, and addictive.    The place has a cute, vintage feel to it.. kind of like you're in someone's back yard.    My hips are glad I don't live closer... my taste buds... not so much.

The groomer did a lovely job on the dogs and they were in good spirits when I picked them up.  I had them do the extra "Furminator" treatment on both dogs and week later, they're still soft (that has never happened before).  It's perhaps a bit on the expensive side compared to what our vet charges but overall, I think it's a better value.    Note that the groomer takes appointments before the retail store opens so if you arrive and they appear closed, don't freak out.  Knock on the door and they'll let you in.  :)

Excellent, excellent!  If you're a fan of the trendy cold brew coffee, they've got a whole wall of it.  You can even get a jar to take-home.  The jar is allegedly for four iced coffee drinks but if you're like me and you like a little coffee in your almond milk, it'll go a lot further.    Because of the rave reviews about the pain perdu, that's what I had to get.  It's essentially bread pudding disguised as breakfast and as far as I'm concerned, that's brilliant.

The entire experience was a giant "Meh" all around.  We reserved a table for six and were squished around a table for four.  It's wasn't terrible but it would behoove a dining establishment to make it larger-group-friendly.    The happy hour house margaritas were okay.  They tasted pretty watered down.  We ordered a pitcher later (at full price, of course) and it tasted better.  That's major points lost for me - an inferior happy hour version or Restaurant Week version does not inspire me to return.    Service was extremely slow although to their credit, it does say they're slow on the menu so they get points for honesty.  One of my dining companions noted that the menu says they charge $1 for a refill on chips.  That's a sad excuse for a Mexican joint in my opinion.    My food was spicy but just okay.  I got the feeling they cover up the average-ness of the food with a lot of spice.    It felt like one of those places where they nickel-and-dime you for everything.  I expect that at fast food restaurants but for a sit-down meal?  Where we would have likely lingered and spent money?  No thank you.

They teach you that when you're about to give bad news, you should start with something positive, right?  Here's the good...  The chips and salsa were really good.  The chips were extra salty and I was happy they arrived that way rather than me pouring on salt like I'm waiting for a heart attack.  The margarita was delicious and at happy hour prices, it's a steal.  The queso and sopas were tasty as well.  The bread pudding was also yummy.  And the bad...    Things were not terribly well seasoned and there were no salt shakers on the tables. Perhaps it's an oversight but tables with no salt shakers are a sign of arrogance.  This is acceptable at places with gourmet food...at your neighborhood Mexican joint?  Not so much.    Where things really fell down for me was the service.  There seem to be general chaos where the servers were concerned.  Our waiter, although he was very, very nice, seemed extremely distracted.  I noticed other tables (all in the bar section) experiencing poor service as well.  Food went to the wrong table.  The wrong check went to the wrong table.  We waited an inexcusably long time for more tortilla chips and my husband had to ask for them twice.  Our drinks sat empty for a very long time.  We even pushed our empty glasses to the edge of the table to indicate that we were not finished medicating ourselves.  Everything took far longer than it should have.    The other thing that bothered me were inconsistencies between what was on the menu/what our waiter described and what came out.  The menu stated the bread pudding came with rum raisin ice cream (yes, please!).  It arrived with vanilla bean ice cream.  The waiter stated that it came with a blueberry sauce but it arrived with what was clearly a raspberry sauce.  It was still a tasty dessert but I like things to arrive as advertised.      I think this place has potential but they have some work to do.

I'm happy to report that my second experience here was much better than my first.    This time around, service was wonderful.  The chips are clearly house made and delicious (they even sneak some fried flour tortilla chips in your basket - bonus).  The margaritas are cranium-sized and quite tasty.  My fish tacos were somewhat untraditional but yummy nonetheless.    The restaurant has a beautiful view of the mountains.  It adds a lot of great ambiance.   This space has been home to a number of places...  I hope this one makes it.

Came here for a friend's birthday celebration.  I didn't eat but my companions seemed generally satisfied with their food.  I had a cider that was delicious.    The service went from good to bad.  At one table, we were served promptly and the waitress gave us separate checks.  We changed to another quieter table and were told by our new waiter that he could not split up the checks.  That caused a huge headache amongst our group and we left with a rather negative impression.

We hired this company on the suggestion of a family member.  Our scorpion issue has been getting worse so we brought them out to seal the house.  It was just done this past week so I can't say how effective it is yet, but they were efficient and prompt.

It's been about a month since our house was sealed and I am thrilled to report that aside from a tiny spider here or there, we've had NO uninvited guests.  If you're having bug issues, I highly recommend having your house sealed.  It was somewhat expensive but the peace of mind has been worth it.

If I could, I'd give 4.5 stars.  We celebrated our anniversary here this past weekend.    The restaurant itself is extremely charming and in cooler temperatures, the patio is probably a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.    Do not miss the craft cocktails.  They are interesting, unique, and tasty.    We shared the brisket on a biscuit and the crab fondue.  The brisket was phenomenal.  The fondue was tasty as well but it did tasty unfortunately fishy.    The filet was perfectly prepared and the brie and basil fingerling potatoes were delicious.  My husband's lamb was enjoyable but he was disappointed to find that the kitchen had substituted peas for fava beans.  He let the waiter know and they were kind enough to buy us dessert.    Our waiter was charming, friendly and appropriately attentive.    I will definitely return.

Super quick and very friendly.  I only wish I lived closer as this is probably not somewhere I will return because it's not terribly close to me.

Because there are so few non-chain or fast food options in the Desert Hills/Anthem area, we gave this another shot and I'm glad we did.  Service was prompt and friendly and lunch was delicious.    The only complaint I have is that we were tantalized by the specials listed on the table but they were out.  Guess we'll have to go back!

Stayed at the Aria and this was really the only meal-meal we ate in the hotel.  It was delicious!  The jalapeno margaritas are just the right amount of lime and spice.  My chicken fajitas were made with Jidori chicken (who does that!?!?!  Vegas, that's who) and were ridiculously good.    Like many restaurants in Vegas (and especially the newer casinos), it's loud so if you're looking to whisper sweet nothings in your honey's ear, she won't hear you.  Also, it seems to attract bachelorette parties (we saw three while we were there) so prepare for some shrieking with your guacamole.

If I were cruel, I would say that the pizza crust is orgasmic and just end the review here.    But, I'm feeling generous so...  go here.  Today.  They had a great beer list as well as homemade wine coolers.  I had the blueberry hibiscus and it a perfect concoction.  The margherita pizza was delicious.  They were not stingy with the cheese or the basil.  My husband had the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  He quite enjoyed it and considering he's not the biggest pizza fan, that's kind of a big deal.  We shared the 'Lil Triple for dessert and it was wonderful as well.  Oreo crust, chocolate creme and toasted marshmallow...    Service was a teensy bit slow but to be fair, they were quite busy.  It was a beautiful day outside but we opted to sit inside as the patio was quite loud since it's on the street.    I realized shortly after being seated that this must be the brainchild of the same folks who run Windsor and I was correct.  (I think the gum wrappers in the sugar containers may have given it away.)    Can't wait to go back!

I took my mom here yesterday for a Deal Chicken deal that included a pedicure and a gel manicure.  It looks like they're still getting up and running but I think they're off to a great start.     My tech was Caitlin and she was great.  She was obviously passionate about nails and very knowledgeable.  She did a great job on my fingers and toes.  My mom had Trisha and enjoyed her very much as well.    All in all, it was a great experience and I would go back!

There's bad service and then there's DirecTV.    We ordered service last Friday and got an installation date of yesterday between noon and 4 p.m.  (A 4 hour window is ridiculous but fine, we played along.)  At 3:50, we received a call from a dispatcher stating that our installation guy was running a few minutes late.  At 6 p.m., we called DirecTV only to discover that they had rescheduled our installation to THREE DAYS FROM NOW without asking or even informing us.  My husband spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a supervisor who insisted that there was no way they could rectify this (as in coming sooner).  If things were this rough just getting started, I shudder to think what an ongoing relationship might have revealed.    We are going back to Dish with our tail between our legs.

The combination butcher/restaurant is a little odd but overall, it's a cute place.  Seating is limited so if you go during prime chow hours, be prepared to wait awkwardly at the front door until someone feels guilty for lingering and leaves.    I had the fish tacos which were wonderful seasoned bits of mahi mahi atop a flour tortilla.  Husband had the nacho trough which he quite enjoyed during the meal but he wondered later whether it had given him a headache.    Service was a bit slow but they only had one waitress working the entire restaurant.   The menu is a bit all over the place so between that, the hunks of dead cow in the butcher case that judge you while you eat, there's a bit of culinary schizophrenia happening.    We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would return.

Very enjoyable!  Drinks were tasty as was our food.  Service was a bit slow at times.  Admittedly, I was leery because we had a less than great experience at the sister facility (The Centurion) next door.

If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, this is a worthy destination.  They have an extensive beer menu (mostly Eastern European) as well as numerous cocktails.   The poutine is good.  I don't know that it's the best poutine I've ever had but it's good.  The gravy tastes a bit cheap so perhaps that's my hangup about it.  The chicken schnitzel is divine.  Well prepared with a tasty sauce.  The potato salad is also some of the best I've had anywhere.  I'm not so much a fan of the green been or basil/tomato salads.  The rosti is delicious.    It's clearly a family owned restaurant that is run with care and that alone makes me want to return.

Yum, yum and yum.  It's hard to think of good sushi being nestled between Yard House and Dave & Busters but it is.    Drinks were delicious - the Thai hot is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy with neither overpowering the other.  I do not like cilantro but the tiny little bit they sprinkle on top adds a little something-something.    The salmon sashimi was delicious as were our rolls.  Husband can't handle spicy but we took a chance and ordered a few of the spicy rolls - he deemed them acceptable.  Rolls were creative, interesting and fresh.      It's a bit on the spendy side but you're eating raw fish in the desert.  You should spend a little money.  :)

From the outside, it doesn't look like much.  But on the inside, there is great sushi, fantastic prices and extremely friendly staff.  The woman who greeted us (the owner perhaps?) asked if we'd been there before.  When we told her we hadn't, she gave us the royal treatment.  She sent out seaweed salad (delicious), fresh wasabi with the sushi and mochi ice cream at the end.  She also brought out our sushi and sashimi in a giant wooden boat.  Really fun experience.     They have happy hour all day.  Rolls are fresh, tasty and interesting!

This should be your go-to if you're looking for a local beer experience.  I'm not a beer person but their hefe is out of this world.  I actually drank the entire thing which is RARE for me.  (I usually drink about half.  Doesn't matter the size - I just want half.)    The food was delicious.  The burger special abomination was a burger topped with an onion ring, mac n' cheese, short ribs and unicorn sprinkles - happy tummies at the table.  My poutine was delicious - my only complaint about it (and this super picky) is that the curds were melted.  But, that is a small price to pay for rich gravy and potato-y goodness.    Desserts are another category entirely.  The grain cookie is just stupid.  The husband makes beer and has made some wonderful dense dark breads out of spent grain.  I didn't think a cookie was possible but it is - it's reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and topped with ice cream and served WARM... you're welcome.  We also got the malt which was tasty but I'd choose the cookie again in a heartbeat.    This joint isn't even remotely in our neighborhood but we'll be comin' back.

I tried this place on the recommendation of a friend.  While they are not pushy about joining, I felt like it was a drive-through assessment.  Very quick and he recommended that I come in at least twice a week.  I have since found a place that I like better.  It's a cool concept but feels little factory-esque.

Best friend loves this place and has been itching to take me here.  We hit this place up before a Marquee show last week.   It's essentially ramen DIY-style.  You pick your broth, fixins' and any extras.  The staff was super friendly, helpful and attentive without hovering.    I'm going to be honest and say ramen bowls are just not my thing.  The broth was delicious and I could have sipped that out of a cup.  I'm just not a fan of what I call "wet food" and ramen bowls are wet food.    That aside, if you're a ramen-ficionado, go here!  You will be pleased.  And leave a message for future generations on the chalkboard wall by the bathrooms.  I might have written "boob" because I'm a 12 year old masquerading as an adult.

We are long time fans of Kevin Binkley.  If he opened a restaurant in the men's bathroom at a Walmart, we would go.  If he served us pate swimming in deer urine, we would eat it.  We surrender our taste buds to his will as often as our wallets and waistlines will allow.    Bink's Midtown in casual joint tucked away in an almost-residential area.  It's small, cozy, and intimate.  Parking is pretty much valet only (unless you want to get vehicularly creative) so bring a few bucks for a tip.    The drinks were fantastic.  The Farmer's Market Margarita was possibly the most complex margarita I've ever tasted.  Magical tequila, cilantro, jalepeno, and other goodness in an unassuming glass - yes, please.  The Strawberry Basil Lemonade was good - dangerously good.    My appetizer of beef risotto was delicious.  Served with a dollop of creme fraiche, it was interesting and untraditional.  My company raved about their octopus and plate of bone marrow.    The sand dabs cooked with brown butter and almonds were out of this world.  Crispy on the outside and ridiculously tender on the inside... these folks know what to do with sea creatures.    My husband enjoyed the bolognese (which he's had many times at Cafe Bink) but was not as fond of this iteration.  It was made with a garlic bread pudding and he felt there was just too much butter.  (Apparently, too much butter is a thing.)  My chocolate puddin' cake was tasty but not jaw droppingly interesting or delicious.  It felt like it was missing a little something.    Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, present without hovering, and quick to offer a suggestion.    We truly enjoyed ourselves and look forward to coming back.

We are at the Esplanade frequently and this place has caught my eye a number of times.  When a coupon came up, I jumped on it and we went.    The value of the coupon was terrific - appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and a bottle of wine for two people for $50.  I started with the cheese plate and it was an eyeful!  Much bigger than expected and I shared with my two dining companions.  My companions were also pleased with their choices of meatballs and pork belly.  I wanted the smoked risotto sans pork belly because I am a pig snob and they were happy to oblige.  They brought it on the side so the rest of my table could nosh on pig heaven.  The risotto was delicious and very interesting.  I don't know that I would have put those two flavors together but it worked very well.      My only criticism of the food is the desserts.  My companions ordered the pumpkin budino.  I sampled a small bite and the caramel sauce tasted a bit grainy as if the sugar hadn't dissolved all the way.  My red velvet cake was a good start but was disappointing.  It was dense as red velvet cake should be (which can almost make it a bit dry) but that's why you have cream cheese icing.  It marries everything beautifully.  SOLO served it sans frosting but with mascarpone gelato and "ganache" which was a literal smear and didn't add anything.  Honestly, I just didn't care for the combination but I was way too codependent to tell the waiter.   All in all, we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The service was great, ambiance was nice and it was just a nice meal all around.  Truthfully, I don't crave Italian food very often but I would come here again.

This Urgent is by no means the closest to my home but it got the best reviews and after a visit, I can see why.  You can book an appointment online which eliminates the hospital-waiting-room-esque quality of many urgent cares.  The facility is new and well maintained.    The nurse practitioner was very thorough in treating me.  It's obvious they are very patient-centered here and that's nice to see.

If Crescent Ballroom and the Marquee had a sordid tryst in a mid-priced hotel, the result would be The Pressroom.  It's got a layout that embodies both Crescent and Marquee but with a skosh more panache.  (Don't forget to look up at the lights - very goth Chihuly).    The area for the "grown folks" has THE largest fan I've ever seen and that is pure brilliance.  It's like someone finally realized that alcohol + dancing = hot sweatiness.  There's also a large (but not as large) over the non-drinking area but presumably it's because those folks are further away from menopause.  *ahem*     Bartenders were friendly and drinks were maybe even on the reasonable side (but don't tell anyone I said that).  I saw folks complaining about the lack of free water but I've been going to concerts for a long time and I've NEVER seen water offered free anywhere.  Put the cost of water in your concert budget and stop complaining.      The only real criticism I have is the parking.  They mention their lot on their website but I'll bet it's over half full after the employees show up.  While it's downtown Phoenix and expecting a decent sized parking lot is unrealistic, they could help their patrons out by posting nearby lots/garages.     It was an enjoyable show/venue and I wouldn't hesitate to come here again!

The major downside of this restaurant is that it's extremely far from my house.  :(  We stopped here for a bit on the way to Tucson and I'm so glad we did.  Rolls were fresh and creative.  Service was excellent.  We had the Banana Mama roll and while it's not my favorite roll, it is possibly the most creative roll I've ever eaten.  Prices were very reasonable and it was a great value.

Upon walking in, I really wanted to like this place.  It's got that local hipster vibe that is cool without bordering on pretentious.  But I must admit, it didn't really do anything for me.  One of the main reasons we decided to go there was because my husband wanted the pot pie... and they were out.  :(    I got the Del Real sandwich and it was tasty enough, but nothing special.  I got a free cookie for checking in on Yelp which was cool but my "homemade" Oreo was on the odd side.    Given the foodie landscape that is quickly developing in Phoenix, I probably won't come back here as there are so many places I love and so many places I have yet to experience.

What a fantastic experience!  I was nervous as this was my first time in a dispensary and they couldn't have made it more comfortable.    There's a comfortable waiting area for non-card holders to wait.  Paperwork was a snap and after getting a copy of my card and driver's license, I was taken into the shopping room.    They were extremely helpful and there was none of that if-you're-buying-this-you-should-be-in-the-know business.  Their products run the full spectrum with different strengths.   If you're new to the game and want a friendly face for your first (or 50th) time, come here.

Before getting to the show, I have to acknowledge the rock star manager at the box office who handled my crisis yesterday.  My flight from Phoenix delayed by FIVE HOURS and it became evident there was no way I was going to make it in time for the 7 p.m. show.  The moment I landed in Vegas, I called the box office and the manager kindly offered to exchange the tickets for the 9:30 show.  The seats available weren't as good as our original seats (purchased months ago) but I was in no position to complain.  Thank you, thank you for saving the day (and my birthday!).    The first 30 minutes were a lot of flash and splash (figuratively) but nothing terribly impressive.  However, it picked up.  It's a little more dancing to MJ songs than an actual story (although there a story but it's easy to miss) and I'm okay with that.      The pole dancer in the Dirty Diana number was incredible.  If strip clubs boasted dancers like that, I'd be a lot more interested in going.    The "wire" suits were phenomenally done.    There's an MJ hologram at one point and it's kind of neat but marginally creepy.  The trampoline section was really cool and I've seen nothing like it.    I didn't understand the point of the chick with the Quiet Riot hair and the fake guitar.  She didn't really seem to fit in with any of it.     Great dancing, great costumes and great visuals.    All in all, a lovely show.  If you're an MJ fan, don't miss this!

I'll be honest.  I'm not a huge butterfly fan.  In general, I'm not a fan of things flying at my face (even pretty things) but my friend wanted to go as part of a birthday outing.    The 3D movie was actually really cool and probably would have been even better had it not been for the children in front of me who were never taught how to behave in public.    The butterfly-ararium (?) was quite nifty as well.  It's similar to the yearly Butterfly House at the Desert Botanical Gardens but on a much larger (and more permanent) scale.  There are LOTS of photo ops here so bring your camera.  Apparently, butterflies like the spa so prepare yourself for a sauna-esque environment.  (My pores were so open afterward!).    There are also other exhibits too...ant farms, bee hives, fish and a sting-ray pool.  Most of the stingrays were anti-social but there was one that seemed to enjoy gliding along the top and making little girls (including me) squeal.  I have no idea how stingrays relate to butterflies but I suppose it's less random than say, giraffes.

We were in the mood for a taco shop but didn't feel like dealing with lines out the door as is common for some of the downtown taco shops.    Service was excellent and they are super friendly.  Also, they have tacos with chicken breast and this is huge because I am a poultry racist.  (I just can't get into dark meat. I've tried.)  If you dine in, they bring you chips that are DELICIOUS.  Perfectly seasoned and the salsa is so good they should sell it.  (In hindsight, I should have asked because I would have loved to take some home.)  My fajita tacos were perfectly seasoned and they serve the tacos "naked" which is pretty genius because then you can visit the salsa bar and add to your heart's content.    It's definitely divey, hole-in-the-wall-y but that's okay.  It's just off the 17 and quite convenient.  I will absolutely be coming back.

I'm always wary of Anthem restaurants as they seem to come and go.  This was a surprising treat.  My buffalo chicken wrap was extremely tasty and did not taste like it was assembled from frozen Costco ingredients.  My husband enjoyed his meal as well.  The red velvet cake was good although it was a bit dry and the frosting too sweet for my tastes.    The menu is strangely electric and I read (I think here on Yelp?) that it was the dream of several restaurant managers who used to get together and barbeque.  The menu is reflective of the things they used to cook together.    All in all, cute place and I'm looking forward to returning.

Sweet little spot situated perfectly between the ball field and US Airways Center.  Never heard of it but it got great reviews on Yelp so we gave it a whirl before the Lady Gaga show.    The Hatch mac n' cheese was extremely tasty and my friend's nachos looked delish.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Extremely reasonably priced too!

Yum.  I'm not a hot dog person.  I can take them or leave them.  But last week, after an evening at Sidebar, we decided to give the location a shot.  (Previously, we had Short Leash Dogs when they catered a friend's wedding.)  Even though they were closing a half hour, service was good and the dogs were (again) delish.

I picked up an egg, cheese, and potato breakfast burrito to eat during my flight.  I had it for about two hours and it kept really well!  It would be extremely easy to slap this combination together for a tasteless boring burrito.  I'm happy to report that it was not at all.  I definitely recommend getting the salsa they offer when you pick up your order.    If you want a meal to carry on that keeps well, this is a great choice.  Staff were very friendly as well.

As fans of Citizen Public House, I was excited to try another of their offerings and they didn't disappoint.  We were there on a slow Saturday afternoon and they treated us like we were the only ones there.  Food was great and their drinks were good.  The bar inside is very cool and they have a lot of interesting stuff.  This would be a good place to sit at the bar and pick the bartender's brain about booze.

I hate leaving negative reviews for  place when the folks are so nice.  Our server and the sushi chef were extremely friendly but I'm sad to say, the food was nothing special.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  As a sushi connoisseur, freshness is the most important ingredient.  The fish didn't taste terribly fresh.  The rolls were mediocre at best and bland at worst.  Husband reported feeling a bit ill afterward.

I'm a Goodwill refugee since they raised their prices.  Epic Thrift has good stuff but their prices are about the same as Goodwill's.  I found some nice things there that I purchased but if you know what you're doing, you can buy brand new clothes for almost the same price.

I'll be honest... it doesn't look like much when you're pulling up and you've got the considerably nicer looking Hampton Inn next door.  At regular price, it was an excellent deal and with a Groupon, it's an amazing deal.  Our room was slightly crowded but the beds and pillows were extremely comfy.    The included breakfast just sweetens the deal... especially with the waffles.  Prior to checking-in, I read someone's review about the waffles and they were spot on.  You might have to hover around the waffle iron a bit because they're a popular offering but it's worth the wait.  They are delicious.    Parking is plentiful and checking in was a breeze.  Definitely recommend!

We attended last year when it was held at The Science Center.  I recall standing in line for an eternity and watching the VIP line whiz right through.  I also recall finding the VIP lounge on the third floor and it looking like somewhere we'd want to be.    So, this year, we sprung for VIP tickets.  The VIP ticket line did move more quickly which was nice.  But the VIP lounge?  Sad.  Sad, sad.  It was essentially a cordoned off hallway with an extra bar, a table of pasta, meats and cheeses, and about 4 large tables.  There was nothing swank about it.    Compared to last year, the event was really disappointing.  The venue was much smaller and while I can't be certain, it seemed like there were less than half the number of restaurants as last year.  There were also a lot of non-food booths (Blackberry?  A shredding company? What?) that I don't recall being there last year either.    2.5 hours in, most of the booths were out of food and had packed up.  That was one full hour before the raffle was supposed to take place.  This is essentially means that if you don't arrive when the event starts, you may not get to eat.    The bars were plentiful, which was nice.  They also did a much better problem of dealing with trash than they did last year.    All in all, I'm not sure I'll go next year.  I think I can find my own "Best Of" right here on Yelp.

The store is clean and they seem to have a lot less crap than other thrift stores.  It's a bit pricey IMO for a thrift store but the overall selection is better and it's a good place to score unique items.

Really fun little place.  There is tons of stuff to look at, gawk at and make you feel old depending on your age.  It's priced for "vintage" so don't expect to find any thrift store bargains.  Don't miss the two rooms in back with men's stuff and purse-and-shoe room.   Also, check out the turtle peep show on your left as you walk in.  They're super cute with healthy "appetites" (assuming it's consensual - we'll just say it is).

I learned about this place via a New Times email and it turned out to be a great little place.  Seated atop The Gelato Stop, it's speakeasy-lounge type of place with a great menu of Prohibition era drinks.  The food menu isn't huge but that's often a good sign.  My lobster roll (which was my virgin lobster roll) was nothing short of fantastic.  Wait staff was great and it's a fun little place to sit and drink on a Saturday.

I did a quick stop in here to get some food on my way to a class.  Honestly, without the glowing Yelp reviews, I don't know that I would have come here.  (It's no one's fault but strip mall restaurants just aren't appealing.  And it's a shame because that's where a lot of the good family-owned places are.)    Service was fast and my chicken wrap was fantastic.  I think they might put crack in their tzatziki - I could eat a bowl of it.  The chicken was tender and extremely flavorful.    I am in the area frequently and look forward to returning when I'm a little less rushed.

The clean slate martini is reason enough to come here - lemon, gin and cucumber.  Fabulous for the summer.    The mushroom truffle pizza was so good that despite my virtuous intentions to take some home for tomorrow's lunch, I ended up eating the entire thing.  (It was going to be soggy by the next day!  I know you understand.)

I woke up with a urinary tract infection and got myself there just as they opened.  I was in and out in about a half hour AND they stocked the antibiotics for my UTI which saved me the laborious trip of going to Walgreens across the street.    For straightforward things, you can't beat Choice Medical.  Convenient, quick and the same co-pay (for me) as a regular doc visit.

I understand that with a first year event there are always kinks to work out.  I certainly don't expect everything to run smoothly.  But REALLY!?!?!  This event was a disaster from start to finish.    The parking was ridiculous.  Attendees were directed to a dirt lot but if you were approaching from the west (as we were), getting into the lot was via green yield.  Which meant that things backed up.  At some point, we turned around and approached from the other direction which was slightly better.  While waiting in the hellish line, one person went on ahead (on foot) to grab the will-call tickets.    Eventually, we gave up and parked on 1st street.  Wish we'd done this from the beginning as there was tons of space and it was just a short walk.    In general, I avoid will-call because it's just one more line to stand in.  But, this event gave us no other option.  The will call lines were crazy long and I was thankful that we had the foresight to send someone ahead.    Upon getting our bracelets, we learned that there is a limit on alcohol samples - we had eight tickets with our bracelets.  This was never disclosed pre-event.  Unlimited should mean unlimited.    The lines for samples were ridiculously long.  To add insult to injury, some of the samples were just downright sad.  And waiting in a very long line for two swallows of wine is just not my idea of a good time.    We happened to note that one restaurant (I forget which one) literally brought a small Weber grill.  Did the organizers not give the restaurants a heads-up on expected attendance or were these guys strangely optimistic? We'll never know.    When all was said and done, the part that bothered us most of all was that we really didn't feel like we got the value out of our tickets.  If we'd each gone to a restaurant and spent $60, we would have had a really nice meal, a cocktail or two and not been cooking for two hours in the Arizona sun.  The event itself was only three hours long and if you "wasted" any event time on signing up for one of many giveaways, watching the band or the cooking demonstrations, or going to the bathroom, that's time you're not standing in line for the next morsel of food.    The Taste in Tempe is literally just that...  a taste.

Great place!  Employees were extremely friendly and we happened in on 50% day.  I got two beautiful martini glasses for a DOLLAR.  You can't beat that.  I will definitely return!

If you're looking for affordable sushi in the Westgate area, look no further!  They had a deal of 5 rolls for $30 and it was a great value.  The rolls were fresh and well-prepared.  It is more of a fast-casual concept so this may not be a great choice if you're looking for a "restaurant experience."    Excellent!

We came here for Restaurant Week and aside from a few hiccups, it was an excellent meal.  Service was excellent and we had a cute window-side table in the bar area.    I generally don't like fruit in savory food but the bruschetta with cherries and goat cheese was pretty darn tasty.  My filet was also fantastically seasoned and delicious and the seasoned potatoes were very yummy.    Just a few suggestions:  We really enjoyed the drinks but the double digit prices + lots of ice make it feel like not a very good deal.    I wasn't asked how I wanted my filet cooked so it was more done than I would have liked.   I had the nutella pudding for dessert and it was something of a fail.  The pudding itself had little white bits in it and the texture was unappealing.  I also realized they served it in an ashtray.  (Granted, it's a vintage ashtray and I know this because I grew up with a smoker.)  It's one of those things where I appreciate the inventive use of it but it's original intention as an ashtray was a bit off-putting.

Awesome place! Locally owned and still in it's infancy, it could put Arizona on the map for booze.  The tour is neat to how their operation works and the samples are pretty fabulous.  Note that it's in a warehouse with a swamp cooler so if you go in the summer, you're going to be a bit toasty.    I had heard of their bourbon but after sampling their gin, I insisted we buy a bottle. It's unlike any gin I've ever had.  Check them out!

Super cute kitschy vintage retro vibe.  It's an Asian Mexican fusion and they pull it off flawlessly.  Service was great and we got each dish as it was ready - and I appreciate that.  Let me have my food when it's hot.    The guacamole with toasted pumpkin seeds was delicious as was the tuna roll and the cookie ice cream sandwich.  I need to come back here when I'm not driving...

I was dubious about meeting friends here outdoors for brunch in JULY (we were a large group) but it was actually fairly comfortable outside.  We arrived at 10 a.m. and by noon, it was starting to get toasty but was surprisingly comfortable outside with the shade and misters.    The Bloody Mary brunch special is suh-weet!  Tito's vodka and I get to put all my own fixins?  Yes, please.  The only thing missing from the bloody bar were olives.  Must have green olives, preferably stuffed with jalapenos.    Food was delicious and I love that I could get a burger at 10:00 a.m. (not all of us are breakfast-food people).  Great service.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely return!

Darling out-of-the-way place that has an excellent wine selection and delicious flatbread.  We started with the fresh bread and while normally I balk at charging for things that many places give away for free, the $3 is nominal for the yummy yeasty experience.  (Do it.)  Ask for extra olive oil and balsamic as you'll likely need it.  Service was excellent and when I requested the check shortly after our meals arrived, our waiter was on the ball with cashing us out and dropping off boxes.    A directional note: take Central to Vernon because if you try to cross Vernon from the west, there's a gate and you'll have to go up to Thomas for a do-over.

Yelpers do it again...  The positive reviews are warranted.  Service was great and they have a great selection of rolls.  Booth seating is comfortable and provides ample room to surreptitiously unbutton the top button of your pants.

The inside is adorable - chic but charming.  Cocktails are presented on an ipad which is kinda nifty but requires you to ask the waitress for it again when ready for a second.  We started with the sea salt rolls, fried brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese.    The sea salt rolls were very tasty but it seems like something that should be free (instead of $3).    The brussel sprouts were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  And as a side, it's a HUGE serving so if you were so inclined (and perhaps spending the evening alone afterward), you could make it your meal.    The mac n' cheese was very tasty although the "bacon" was more like rubbery bits of ham.  They're large enough that you can pick around them (as I did) but I vote for nixing them altogether.    The pan fried chicken with grits was delicious.  Chicken was well seasoned and expertly prepared (note that it does come with a bone for the bone-averse folks).  The grits were very tasty but a bit rich for me.  Husband loved them.    Even though culinary death was imminent, we went for broke and ordered the banana pie.  Let me just say - I do not like pie.  I like pie filling but you can have your soggy floppy crust.  This is NOT "regular pie."  It has a cookie crust topped with banana pie-ness and toasted marshmallow.  I know the combination sounds iffy but it's good.  Trust me.  Take a piece home if you can't possibly stuff your facehole with it after dinner.

Upon walking in, I have to admit, it felt like the "black light" section at Spencer's that felt really neat to me as a kid but is less than impressive as an adult.  It was also much smaller than I imagined and I felt like I might have to apologize to the six friends I'd convinced to come putt with me.    I'm happy to report that it much more enjoyable than initially expected.  Balls are numbered so as many six or seven players can play together.  They've made scorekeeping easy with clipboards on lanyards.  There are several "recharging" stations throughout the course so you can keep your ball nice and bright.    Small as it was, the course was a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, we'd underestimated the amount of time needed and had to rush a bit to get through it in order to make our dinner reservation.    I'm mentally bookmarking this place for the summer - it's an excellent alternative to typical Phoenix escape-the-heat activities.

Excellent froyo!  The red velvet cake was spot-on and they have a great selection of toppings.  I liked that the candy toppings were in dispensers.  I've had a number of experiences where the candy is out in the open and get stale.  Unfortunately, I don't live near a Menchies but perhaps this is a good thing.  ;)

After our experience, I'm a bit befuddled by all of the positive reviews.    The idea of a "stand" (it's just a window where you order and there's no indoor area at all) is cutesy but on a hot Arizona night when it was 110 degrees at 8 p.m., it was annoying.  This place has soft serve and while I like soft serve, I didn't care for mine. The texture was odd and almost mealy.

I experienced this place for the first time last week and it's a very cute little club.  The layout is similar to the Marquee but a fair bit smaller and definitely more stylish (check out the guitar chandelier over the bar near the front door).  Drinks were what you expect at concert venues and my double was definitely a generous pour.    As it's Old Town, parking is a little hairy but I recommend parking in the Galleria garage.  It's quite close and beats playing chicken with other concert-goers trying to find parking too.

We popped in for drinks and a snack while waiting for friends to finish their movie.  The drink menu is creative and interesting.  The hush puppies are delish - but note that much of the "good stuff" falls to the bottom of the "cone."  Make sure to eat that!

This is the real deal - family owned Lebanese restaurant with amazing food.  Service was slightly brusque but the falafel was delicious.  It doesn't look like much from the strip-mall exterior, but give this place a shot.  You'll be glad you did.

This is a "biker bar" but of the Schwinn variety rather than the vroom-vroom bikes so popular in Cave Creek.  Cute, homey place with a small menu (this is usually a good sign and in this case, it was) and lots of coffee-shop beverages.  The folks were extremely friendly and it was a lovely spot to sit and chill for a while.  I'd like to come back in the evening to try the mac n' cheese.

I don't like BBQ all that much but the husband does so occasionally I indulge him.  Our trek to Naked BBQ turned out to be a delightful experience.  They smoked turkey for those of us not into BBQ is fantastic.  Mac n' cheese was delicious.  Perhaps the most important?  The folks there care about customer experience.  We were asked multiple times if we wanted to try things or if they could get us anything else.  These folks love what they do and it shows.

This place is like a constant wine tasting - it's effectively serve-yourself wine with you in the driver's seat in terms of samples, half pours or full pours.  This is an excellent way to try a lot of wine without the commitment of a full glass.  It's super cute inside and would be a fun spot to spend an afternoon snacking and wine sampling.      My only complaint was that our server disappeared and we were in a small panic to get our checks in order to retrieve our cars from valet before they closed.  Once we tracked her down, it seemed to take a very long time time to run our cards.  Service could use some tweaking.

The cocktail list here verges on "sorority drinks" (all sugar, no finesse) but manages to stay one step above.  My donkey punch was delicious and I can safely say it's the most pleasurable donkey punch I've ever had.  ;)    Timing on the food was a bit off as we ordered fries for an appetizer and they actually came after the meal.  The patio is a great place to people-watch and I didn't find the road noise off-putting (I often do).

The positive reviews are warranted.  Drinks were absolutely delicious and the lobster roll was outstanding.  Service was excellent and it was a lovely meal.    I found the decor... confusing.  It's part Jack-Johnson-beach-shack, part garage-sale-vintage and part your parent's basement.  While I appreciate that it's not the sleek Scottsdale norm of brushed steel and granite, I'm not sure it fits together terribly well.  What's even stranger is that the bathrooms look like they were plucked out of a Scottsdale-brushed-steel-granite restaurant.  The stalls are roomy and there's more than enough room for a set or two of jumping jacks.

The high reviews are warranted.  The happy hour is fantastic - all manner of fried things and delicious caipirinhas for next to nothing (and you can eat anywhere - you aren't put in "bar time-out" in uncomfortable chairs).     The apps were delicious and I look forward to returning for a meal-meal.

The sweet n' spicy is CRAZY GOOD.  It's a perfect blend of mouth-fire and sweet.  Food was pretty tasty too.  My flatbread was delicious.     I have to give credit to our server who dealt with my goofy answer of "a pony" when he asked if there was *anything* else he could get us.  (He asked!)  Once he understood I was joking, he rolled with it.    Great place and I'd definitely come here again.

I do not use the Pinspiration website (partially because I'm old and don't get it and partially because....  well, no..  I guess it's just because I'm old and cranky).  HOWEVER, even if you're not a Pinspiration vet, this is still an awfully fun place.  I love that small bites, s'mores and WINE are available.  And I love that friends can choose different things.  The crafts are color coded for level of difficulty so you can choose how much you want to tax your brain and/how much wine could or or should be consumed for a successful project.  The staff was really helpful and friendly.  We each were given iPads with the instructions on them and left to our own devices.  I don't think we were there 15 minutes before best friend declared that we were absolutely coming back.    The only criticism I have is that there was a painting class right next to us and the teacher was talking perhaps unnecessarily loudly.  It was a bit distracting at times and sometimes difficult to hear each other.

Yummy food, interesting location AND parking in Tempe?  Sold!  Cooler temps will make the outdoor patio all that more appealing and there's ample parking in the garage just next to the restaurant.  Their hummus is weird (like you-might-not-want-to-order-it weird) but do it anyway.  You won't regret it.  Service was great - would definitely return!

This turned out to be an expected and delicious surprise!  After a day of thrifting in 115+ degree heat, we were in need of sustenance and margaritas.  The gentlemen who seated us and waited on us was delightful and was kind of enough to bring me a little cup of sliced jalapenos for my margaritas - TWICE!   The chips, salsa and bean dip are so good that you could literally just stop there.  You shouldn't.  But you could.    My enchiladas were fantastic and everything tasted homemade.  Our server confirmed that the chef makes all of her own everything.  That was evident and I ate until I nearly burst.    The location isn't sexy at all (little strip mall in North Phoenix) but pay no mind and come here for your next Mexican feast.

Even if you don't need a sequin pantsuit or a polyester thingamajig a la Jackie O, this is worth a stop.  Young or old, you're bound to ask "We really wore that?" or "People really wore this?"  It's an absolute hoot.  Prices are on the high side but as a child of the 80's, I can assure you the items here are the real deal.

Took the furchildren here this past week and it was a great experience.  They were professional, friendly and the pups looked great afterward.  If you have a fluffy pooch but balk at the add-on of the furminator, DON'T.  It's worth it.    We will definitely be back!

Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and as Crudo fans, we were hoping for awesome.    Unfortunately, it fell significantly short of awesome.    It was HOT in there and I really wanted to order a drink and pull up a chair for our server (who was sweet, kind, attentive and practically melting on her feet).  She said the AC hadn't been functioning well for weeks but management wasn't seeing it and customers weren't complaining.  (I saw at least five patrons including myself fanning themselves with menus.)      It was also extremely loud.  The acoustics are such that everything echos and it turned into Husband and I speaking loudly to each other.    Me: "Happy Anniversary!" Him: "We can't afford a new car."    The drinks were outstanding.  The food was...  meh.  I loved the hush puppies and goat cheese combo but Husband made the point that you shouldn't rely on condiments to make the meal.  He's right.  The little buggers were pretty dry.    I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and was underwhelmed.  I hate to say this but they were reminiscent of Sloppy Joes.  Husband had the pulled pork and as a BBQ fan, he was wasn't thrilled with it.    We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert.

The good?  The food was delicious.  The bad? It's pretty spendy.  The lobster bisque was DELISH as was the smoked scallop under glass - but at $9 a pop, it'll leave you wanting.  Drinks were also tasty.    Another reviewer mentioned the cigar smell and we noticed it too.  It is unfortunately pretty off-putting to smell that while you're eating.  I'm guessing eating outside might be better?

What a fun little place!  With sexy decor and wait staff that are as fun as they are knowledgeable, this is a great place to chill on a lazy afternoon.  We shared a bottle of wine and got the bruschetta - it was unexpectedly delightful and interesting.  I also had an eggnog cannoli that may not have been extraordinarily authentic, but it was darn tasty.

They have an excellent tap list and I think they're definitely finding their niche in the Phoenix gastropub market.  The buffalo chicken fries weren't exactly what I was expecting.  They aren't "chicken fries" a la Burger King but buffalo chicken on top of actual potato fries.  I enjoyed them but felt the menu description was a bit misleading.    Bread pudding was good although not the best I've ever had.

When you see folks ahead of you walk away with a single scoop, don't cry for them, judge them or wonder why they don't realize you can't have too much ice cream.    Trust me, the single scoopers know what they're doing.  We scoffed at them and got ourselves the double scoops and it was completely unnecessary.  If ice cream got married to gelato and then they ran off to live in a polyamorous relationship with a very open-minded cow... this is Creamistry ice cream.  It's ridiculously rich and unbelievably creamy.    (For me to say something that's rich is meaningful as I've often heard "How can you eat that?  It's so rich."  Yeah.  Not a problem.)    It is on the spendy side but worth it because it's got a bit mad science to it with the wisps of nitrogen wafting over the counter and of course... the crazy good ice cream.
