Good appliances at a good price.  The rebates took 4 months to get in the mail.

I am a 5 days a week customer that lives in the neighborhood.  The store is clean and stocked however the customer service is spotty.  There are a few excellent cashiers and stockers and I go out of my way to get in their line if they are working.  The others still need work or need to be replaced with folks that enjoy working in the customer service industry.  Today I tried the deli after taking a break from it for awhile  because of a bad experience.  I'm dieting so I picked a sprouted loaf of bread from the shelf, took it over to the deli and placed my order.  After looking at my paper order form the clerk returned to tell me that I needed to produce a receipt for the bread before she could make my sandwich.  I questioned this because, since there is no cash register at the deli, I have to take the sandwiches to the check out and pay for them.  They trust me with the sandwiches but not the bread?  The entire interaction is too long to explain here.  Suffice it to say the experience was less than one star but I'm giving two because as long as I stay away from the deli, fresh meat section and some cashiers my experience is pretty good.  I too am in the customer service business, serving over 1k customers a day.  I do not tolerate this sort of behavior and neither should Sprouts.
