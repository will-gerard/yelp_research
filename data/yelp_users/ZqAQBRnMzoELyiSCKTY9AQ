LOVE the Tuscan Tuna panini! Great creme brulee as well! The atmosphere is great, super convenient location and free valet! I look forward to making this place a frequent lunch stop.

Best sushi I've had in Arizona, by far. My boyfriend and I recently moved to Tempe from Gilbert and still make the trek to eat Sake's tasty creations. He knows what we like and always suggests new rolls. The service is always great too and you get free dessert at the end. Love love LOVE Temari.

For some strange reason I was craving fettuccine alfredo so instead of going all the way to Olive Garden or trying alfredo from some random place like California Pizza Kitchen, we decided to try take-out from FloriDino's. We'd ordered pizza muffins from here before because we live in the area and didn't want to drive all the way to the Chandler Floridino's for them. (The pizza muffins are not as good at this Gilbert location, by the way)  Well, we were less than impressed. My boyfriend got the baked spaghetti with meat sauce and I got fettuccine alfredo with chicken. I tried the BF's baked spaghetti and it was just okay. My fettucine alfredo was totally BLEH. The noodles were overcooked, the sauce had no flavor and the chicken was grey! Chicken isn't supposed to be grey, right? I had to add a couple shakes of my own parmesan cheese, salt, pepper and garlic powder to even give it a taste! Needless to say, I did not eat the chicken so I can't really comment on it's flavor.   I don't plan on coming back here and will be driving to the Chandler Floridino's for my future pizza muffin needs.

I was referred to Dr. Okun by a co-worker and must say I'm glad she referred me! The location is convenient and the office is clean and modern looking. The staff was very helpful and nice. I went in for my regular 6 month cleaning and got to watch The Office while they worked. X-rays were taken fairly quickly and I was out within 30 or so minutes! My previous dentist office was less than subpar so I'm looking forward to coming here in the future!

Let me break it down for you...  1) The beer is delicious. If it's in season, try the Pumpkin Porter. 2) I've yet to try one bad appetizer or entree. The oatmeal stout shake is bomb diggity. 3) The atmosphere is very brewery-ish. Don't come here if you're in a hurry....the wait gets a little redonkulous sometimes. Also, don't wear high heels. There's lots of uneven flooring and brick.....this is not Scottsdale, mmmkay? 4) Parking sucks big time. Plan to walk a mile or through a back alley.   If you are from out of town or have never been.....there's really nowhere else better on the east side, or in Phoenix for that matter, to get delicious beer and yummy food.  My recommendations: Kilt Lifter is the local favorite, go for Hop Knot if you like plant-y beers. I'd lop off my own arm for a Chicken Roll (and that jalapeno sauce). Don't miss out on those. Come here for game day....it's a hoot.  That is all.

We came here for Restaurant Week and also for my boyfriend's birthday. We were seated inside next to the fireplace in a very awkward spot. I was sitting on one side of the table that was on the other side of a half wall/open window type thing, which was less than 12 inches from the guy at the table next to us. The kitchen was right by us as well so there were dishes being slammed around and lots of other loud things going on. We asked to be moved outside even though it was a little on the warm side. The patio is nice, although I wasn't a fan of the random cat that showed up (other than funny internet pictures, I do not see a use for cats).   We each chose a different app, entree and dessert. I wasn't excited about the salad but it turned out to be great! The entree and desserts were the highlight of the meal. We had the arugula salad, pork belly, short ribs, hoki, cinnamon roll and strawberry shortcake. All of it was pretty damn tasty!   I think the food is worth the price and the porch is great for casual wine drinking :) I'll definitely be coming back!

I've been here twice and both times I wish I'd gone somewhere else. The sushi was not very good (I believe whatever I had made me sick) and the bowls are mediocre at best. I'd suggest going to Chipotle next door unless you're craving overpriced "meh" Japanese food.

The first time I found myself at Rose & Crown was at the beginning of an all day pub crawl downtown. The fish and chips were a GREAT way to start the day as they were everything I expected from an English/British/Whatever pub. The only downfall to this place is the bathroom situation. There's one women's bathroom (that I know of) which can suck on a Saturday night. BUT the beer selection is always pretty legit and they have root beer which most bars don't serve (if you haven't tried root beer and vanilla vodka, you're missing out)! I've managed to wind up at Rose & Crown several other times, mostly at the end of the night, and it tends to be pretty consistent. The staff has always been great and the patio/front porch area is one of my favorite places to be in Phoenix!! Love!

Absolutely LOVE Postino! It's by far one of the best moderately priced restaurants/wine bars in Phoenix. The Tuscan Tuna sandwich is to die for and the atmosphere is great! Love the little gum cards available on all the tables too!

I've been coming to Horwitz for a few years now and I love it! The staff is always helpful, Dr. Horwitz is great and the location is very convenient. They've always answered any insurance questions I've had, helped find the best contacts for me and I always get free solution and lense cleaner. The only "complaint" I have is not really a complaint, just that they're usually really busy. I tend to be placed on hold when I call and have to wait to pick up my contacts. I guess that just means they're a great vision center and should consider expanding!

The view was amazing, the drinks were wicked expensive (albeit tasty), the food was fantastical and the ambiance on the patio was pretty darn romantic. My water glass was very small but was NEVER empty as we seemed to have a team of people tending to our table (party of 7). Also, the cheesecake lollipops at the end of the meal were an added bonus and I'll be making the hour long treck up there again just for those little suckers!!   Worth the drive, worth the money! Loved it!!!

I thought I found a good place after moving back to Gilbert but unfortunately that is not the case. It's like they just want to get you out of the door! One guy (probably the owner) was taking call after call during my manicure and didn't even give me the dang hand/arm massage. That's the best freaking part! I got a manicure and another girl asked me if I wanted the massage. Are people opting out of this? They need to be slapped if that is the case. Then I noticed they are now using the dremel to take cuticles off. HUH??!! That feels lovely, especially right after they JAM your cuticles back with the metal platypus stick thing cuz they're in a hurry. Or instead of clipping the cuticle, they grab and PULL it with the nibbers (I don't know the actual name of those torture devices, that's just always what my mom called them). I felt like Black Swan! Four of my fingers now have sores on them. I won't be back.

We picked Tapas Papa Frita from the Restaurant Week website for our anniversary dinner on a Saturday. I was hoping for a romantic spot on the patio since it was nice outside and we'd beat the crowd with our 5:30pm reservation. Inside the restaurant was pretty bare so unfortunately we were given an awkward table in the back, facing the bar and near the kitchen...probably to give the inside servers something to do...even though I'd put "Anniversary Dinner :)" on our OpenTable reservation/note to the restaurant. I wouldn't have minded this so much since we were isolated from everyone else, but another couple was seated directly behind us, about 3 feet away so it was just plain awkward.   Our server Vincent was actually pretty amazing. My water was never empty and he even went out of his way to ask the chef if we could order an item from the Restaurant Week menu (since we'd strayed onto the regular menu for the paella). We ordered two items from the tapas menu - crab stuffed peppers and the patatas w/ aioli, plus the bacon wrapped dates (RW menu item), and all three were awesome. I ordered the steak + bleu cheese and my SO ordered the diablo paella. The steak was cooked perfectly but the paella was lacking some serious spice considering the title, albeit delicious and well seasoned. I also ordered the sangria, which I thought was great (and even ate the fruit). Overall we left the restaurant stuffed and pleased with our anniversary date location decision.   And now my reasoning for the poor rating. Several hours after leaving TPF I started to get a stomach ache that, at first, felt like my stomach just wasn't agreeing with all of that food I ate, but then turned into something sinister. I'll spare you the gory details but will say that this was definitely food poisoning. Fever, nausea, the whole nine yards. I'm not sure what exactly it was - my mom blames the sangria fruit - but needless to say I don't plan on eating steak, bleu cheese, or any of the items we ordered that night anytime soon.

These donuts are dericious! I haven't had their signature boba drink because small round globbies freak me out. Their coffee is decent and their bagels are too. Stick with the donuts though :)

Phoenix Carpet Repair is awesome!!   I called to get a quote on Thursday for a few minor carpet repairs (damn dogs) and was told it would cost $275 for everything. The representative told me they had an open time slot the following day (Friday) from 2pm to 4:30pm. I had to talk it over with my better half and didn't end up calling back until Friday morning. They were able to have someone out to my house that afternoon.  Rob was super nice and had everything done within 1.5 hours. The carpet looks great! You can't even tell there's new carpet there! The best part is that they charged the same amount they quoted, which is rare.  The only reason I'm giving them four stars and not five is because I'd mentioned a little area off to the side that just needed to be nailed/stapled down but it was still unattached after he left. I'm sure he just forgot and you can't even really tell so I'll probably just try to do it myself.   All in all, a great experience!

The ice cream is delicious! Had butter pecan and some sort of caramely cashew concoction. The cookies also looked super tasty, will definitely have to try those next time.  The only downfalls to this place are the parking and interior layout. There's not much parking available and if you can't snatch a spot, valet seems to be your only option. The interior is somewhat small and kind of awkward if there are more than three people in line. Would this stop me from going? Absolutely not.  Love this place!

Dear sweet baby Jesus this place is amazing! We make the trek up to Scottsdale from Gilbert at least once every two months for these burgers. The peanut butter & jelly sriracha burger is to die for! We usually try to switch it up every time we come and the specials are delicious but we always go back to ye olde favorites....pb&j or hangover. Try the sweet potato tots with the Chipotle aioli.... SO GOOD. Decent beer selection too. Sometimes you run into your douchey Scottsdale bar goer pre-gaming on a Saturday but the burgers make it worth it.

We came here for Restaurant Week and this was by far my most favorite one we tried (out of four). We were a party of two and were seated at the corner table on the patio so it felt very romantic!  We had the grilled cheese & tomato soup appetizer as well as the pretzel knots, which were both great! The spicy cheese sauce that came with the pretzel knots should be put in a gallon bottle and sold individually for people to take home!  Our entrees were also delicious...roasted chicken and some sort of pork (can't remember what the boy had). My mashed potatoes were creamy but I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy.  The desserts we chose were Death by Chocolate banana split and the Every Berry We Carry pie. I think the banana split was decent. I guess I want more of a traditional banana split as opposed to what they provided. I also wasn't a HUGE fan of the berry pie but I think that's because there was some sort of odd ice cream on top, possibly with basil in it and basil is pretty awful in my opinion.  We'll definitely be back for the chicken and waffles!!

Meh. I ate this pizza sober and it was just bland. Give me about 5 delicious IPAs and I'm sure it'd be fantastic! But so is Filiberto's when you're three sheets to the wind. I'll deal with the horrendous parking situation at Cibo next time.

We have visited the store several times, purchased from the farmers market and ordered online. All of these experiences have been wonderful and the marshmallows (obviously) are delicious and keep us coming back for more! The staff is always friendly and helped our 8 year old build her own s'more at the bar. They even ship to Ohio and New Jersey! Awesome.  Try the lemon bar, horchata and rocky road marshmallows!
