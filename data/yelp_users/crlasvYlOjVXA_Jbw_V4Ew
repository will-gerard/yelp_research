Ok, I'm writing this review after going to this place about 4 times.  It is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here I thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in Tempe Marketplace and I felt lazy to go there that day.   First time, I got a pedi and full set and had no issues. I did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but I was ok with it. That particular day they were busy and I think her son and bf were both helping out. It's a family business which I think is great.   Second time was a fill and pedi. She seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasn't covering the whole nail, some nails weren't even and  just a sloppy job. She asked me who had done my nails... I told her she had (the owner).   Third time, I went in... Same thing... The girl doing my pedi n French tip couldn't get it right.... They were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips. Messy.  When the owner started doing my nails she noticed I kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done. Well. Again, she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and AGAIN asked me who had done my nails... I told her it was her.  She finished and again.... Same thing... Nails not even... Clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over. I hate complaining so I just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them... I felt bad.   I came back a couple days later cause I broke a nail and I mentioned to her about the clear coat and I showed her... And she fixed it. She also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it (again) like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails. Whatever I left.   I went back yesterday (11/18/13) and she meets me at door saying "oh we too busy" it's only three of them working.... And I was like "ok" (sounded like she was telling me to go!!) I said it's ok I can wait....  Well I should've left!!!!   I decided to get my toenails red... That's how bad I didn't want the girl to try doing the French tip! I never paint my toe nails red!! Ever!!!  Then (the owner) started looking at my nails and she AGAIN asked me who had done them cause they didn't look good and asked why that broken nail SHE had fixed wasn't as wide as the others!!!!!!! I told her it was herself and she shut up.  She honestly seems to be very very lazy and ALWAYS ALWAYS in a hurry.   I'm not the type of person that complains but I don't like telling u how to do your job either cause I don't like others telling me how to do mine. But this time... I had had it.   I asked her to fix several things... And then she puts the clear coat... And tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy... Once my nails were done.. I pull them out and she files the edges a bit... And she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat... I tell her and she said "oh u did it when u out ur hand down" SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND!!!  And then I asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat.  She reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said I was done. I looked at my nails and she could see I was upset.  Because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasn't even dry.. There's bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush....   I was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off... So I told her never mind.   As I'm paying she sees I'm not happy cause I keep looking at my nails and she says... "U ok? I fix for u" I said "don't worry about it"... I paid.. Left no tip and walked out.   I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymore.  Her work is very VERY VERY SLOPPY.... She is ALWAYS is a hurry and ALWAYS understaffed.   I would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work. I wished she had more pride n what she does. Being n the customer service field I know that when I'm with a customer... That's my only customer and I concentrate n them and only them. To rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business.   If u go there, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seen.

I've been here three times and have never had an issue. He has always been very courteous and has always had my items ready on time. I will keep coming back here although I wish I didn't have to dry clean my uniforms lol  Oh and yes he helped me with a 15% discount the first time I went in.

Beyond rude! Omg I just came to pick up my bfs stuff and this black fucking lady with a cheap ass BLONDE weave, GREEN contacts and McDonald fucking eyebrows just yelled at me and made me fucking cry.    She yelled at me that 1)-the package was to him 2)-we weren't legally married 3)-I didn't have his last name and 4)-that I had no business trying to pick something that didn't belong to me.  She yelled at me with the place full of customers. As I was walking away she yelled "those are the rules!!" I said back "I understand there's rules but there's no need for your attitude"  I don't write complaints but I'm going to send this to customer service. I came back in and asked for her name and she said some weird name that sounded like "Daisy" but who the fuck knows.   Oh and she's also the supervisor. As I was walking out the door she said "if that's a complaint I don't care" and I said "yes it actually will be a complaint".   What a shitty fucking POS lady she is.   I can't believe I cried. She said all that in front of everyone! I'm so upset. Ugh   I'm sorry about the language. This happened at the #Awhatukee location on 51st St 11/07/15 around 12:45ish (15mins before closing, still doesn't excuse her rudeness!)  Mind u, I've picked up packages before ever for my roommate!!!!!  #usps @usps #USPostalService @USPostalService

Stayed here for 4 weeks. Never had an issue, always friendly! They have a delicious breakfast and also some snacks at night and complimentary adult beverages. I love this place. A month later I had to come back here and I stayed there again for free because I had accumulated points for the 4 weeks I stayed there before.  Seriously this is a great hotel, great service, and great location! Off the 10/University.
