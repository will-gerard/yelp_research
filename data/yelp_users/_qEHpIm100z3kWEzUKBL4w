If you order from here get it take out. It took them 2 hours to deliver my one pizza. My poor kids were starving and I didn't even get an apology. I kept calling and they kept saying it would come in 5 mins. They need to get their act together.

I guess I'm just spoiled. This is like the fast food of eye doctors. If you go to fast food you shouldn't expect sit down service. So it goes here. The staff are standing around  and my appointment was an hour ago. We have been sitting and sitting. Meanwhile the kids movie that was playing in the VCR/TV combo just finished and I've been listening to the snowy white noise for 10 mins. My well-behaved 11 year old son has been patiently waiting with his sunglasses on. Don't come here if you are expecting prompt and personable service.

I love this place. It's small and not the most fancy but oh boy is it delicious. The curry is divine and the noodles just right. Not to mention the custard topped sticky rice...my oh my!

They. Are. So. Slow.  I only go here because it's the only smoothie place near me. It's usually pretty good once you get the food. But seriously I feel so bad for the kids who work here because they are usually working alone - doing both the dining room and drive through. They need to step it up.

This Thai food is amazing. The service was somewhat slow, but well worth the wait. The curry is delish and the soup divine. Overall yumalicious!

Drive thru is SO slow. Bagels are always good but this location needs friendlier staff. When I finally got up to the window (there was only one person in line ahead of me) I mentioned how long I had to wait. Her reply "well we had to wait on someone's egg." A simple "sorry about that" would have left me satisfied. Come on guys - let's beef up the customer service!!! It will certainly make up for the slowness.

Maidpro is the best decision I've made for myself in a long time! As a working mother of 5 kids I could hardly find the time to pick up let alone clean my entire house!   When i come home after the girls have been there, it's like a breath of fresh air! I tell all my friends about the detailed work they do and the reasonable prices!! Love them!!

What originally sold me on signing up is how easy it is to cancel if need be with no fees. This appealed to me bc of my busy lifestyle. I tried for 5 weeks to cancel my membership after a month of working out but seeing no real results.  I got charged the fee after I had called to cancel and they would not refund because phone "records" didn't match my story. I called 3x wherein they told me someone would call me back - instead of canceling my membership as requested. So I went by in person and Brave the manager was never in to cancel it. Apparently she is the only one who can authorize a cancelation?? After several attempts I finally got her on the phone - I was livid because I was charged a fee after leaving several "messages" with people to please cancel. She "waived" the upcoming second charge as if I didn't give 30 days notice. It took me over 30 days to cancel - if original request was followed I wouldn't have been charged this month. Terrible records and customer service. It's definitely a sales boiler room used car salesman feeling you get as soon as you try to cancel.  I've had several friends tell me the exact same story.

Update: Orange Theory has since refunded the fee they withdrew from my account. It took a lot of effort but finally did the right thing because their records were incorrect.

I love this place. Everything I've tried has been so good. Don't expect traditional recipes, however. Read the descriptions! The food is really unique and yummy! Because everything is healthy, portion sizes are smaller - but it's really filling. I love that there is a fresh and healthy option for eating out in our area. It's a super cute family environment that we all enjoy. My picky eater kids love the Mac and cheese and I don't feel guilty letting them get it because I know the ingredients are fresh and it's made with good stuff!!
