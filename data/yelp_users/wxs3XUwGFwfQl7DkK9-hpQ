California Eggs Benedict.  Too filling for one person but definitely made me homesick for California.

Great atmosphere and delish food...try the carne adovada with fried eggs...delish!  you might want to share it though because it's huge...was also happy to know there was pear cider for the non-beer drinking pretending to drink beer.

This is my favorite cafe in Phoenix to study at...amazing coffee and delicious treats.  If I am going to eat lunch, I prefer next door at Pane Bianco.  And when I went on Sunday there was a live DJ.  Also so much space so you can choose noise level you desire and spread out your books and computer.  Reminds me of coffee shops in the northwest like Portland.

Best pho in the area. period.  Especially useful to soothe a sore throat or clear sinuses.

It's good for desserts...famous for the frozen hot chocolate.  But really all of the sundaes and cake are delicious.  Definitely a must-try for all the sweet-tooths out there!  I think the food is ok and there are definitely many American options (salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc), but really it's about the treats!

Just got a $10 groupon for 10 classes, what an amazing deal is that!?!  Great location in downtown Mesa and the room is spacious with perfect lighting.  With so many classes available I can always turn to this place to get my yoga fill.
