Restaurant itself was very nice. View was very good next to the windows. The ribeye was only average but the chicken was very good. Creme brulee and the chocolate espresso desserts were excellent.

One of the worst experiences I've had in a long time with a business. I purchased tires from them with their warranty about 6 months ago. Three months ago one of the tires had a leak. They repaired the tire and sent me on my way after leaving the car there from 10am, they finish repairing the tire at 4 pm. A few weeks later the leak is back. They repair it again, this time I drop it off at 8am and they still finish at 3pm.. Another two weeks and the leak comes back again. Finally they are willing to order a new tire. It takes them two months to get the tire, with me calling them every week to check if it's in. It's funny how when I first wanted to buy the tires they were able to get it the next day, but when they need to stand by their replacement warranty, it takes 2 months. Finally they get it and I drop the car off at 11am on a Wednesday. They do not finish with my car until 3:30pm. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take four and a half hours to change a tire. Will never do business with them again and will warn everyone I know about them.

This review is for the Arizona Grand Resort's wedding reception services. We went to several different resorts throughout Phoenix and Scottsdale prior to making our decision and I found wedding coordinator, Dawn Candrea, to be the warmest and nicest person we spoke to. She was detailed and informative. Once we chose The Grand, she kept us on track with everything, which was especially helpful as we were starting to get overwhelmed as our wedding day drew closer.  We had a few minor issues at the reception. The wedding favors and toasting flutes that we'd dropped off the day before did not make it to the ballroom with the other items.  The staff had to rush to find the items as the reception started. Other than those issues, the reception went really well. The staff was attentive to us and all our guests. We received several compliments on how nice the staff was. The food was delicious and everyone raved about it.  Many guests were surprised by the quality since they were expecting traditional hotel banquet food. Our wedding cake, which the hotel made, looked beautiful and tasted great.   The Grand put us up in one of their villa hotel suites the night of the reception. It was very nice inside and they really decorated it beautifully for our wedding night. Rose petals were everywhere and they gifted us with a chilled bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and an engraved wine box. When I called the front office next morning for a late checkout, the front desk person, realizing that we were the bride and groom, moved things around so we could check out later, free of charge.  Our wedding reception really turned out great thanks to Dawn and the rest of the staff at The Arizona Grand Resort.

Went here for a late Valentine's day dinner. We had set reservations well in advance. The restaurant had kind of a cheesy sky painted in the ceiling. We were placed in a corner table near the bar. It wasn't a huge deal but I did feel separated from the rest of the restaurant. Overall, the decor isn't high end but it's not terrible either.  We were seated immediately by the hostess, which is always nice when it's a busy Friday night. Our service was relatively spot on the entire night. They took a little long on the salad my girlfriend order, but they gave her a full salad instead of the half to compensate. Otherwise, we felt attended to pretty much the whole night.  The food was very good. I ordered the halibut, which was the special for the night. It came out tasting light and very good. My girlfriend ordered the chicken parm which I thought was terrific. Had the creme brulee for dessert and that was great as well.  Overall, we were very happy with our meal and night.

Jodi and her staff were great. She was able to deal with the constant changes that we were making to our order with ease. Her prices were about half of what we were getting quoted at other places. The only thing that was a little different during our consultation with Jodi than with other flower shops was that the building of the bouquets and centerpieces were not as detailed as with other shops. We left much of the building of the flowers to her expertise. This turned out OK as all the flowers pieces turned out beautiful. The roses that were placed on our wedding cake made it look amazing beyond words. Would definitely be recommending Jodi to others.

I've been to this place a couple of times and each time I've gotten great service from the staff. I'm not sure how they choose their people but they are always friendly and attentive.  Most of the food is pretty good. Their signature burger is good but needs a little ketchup. I've also had the Grilled Chicken Panini which was ok but not great. It just seemed a little bland. The bread that they use is always really good. I love their sweet potato fries and would get it all the time if it wasn't for my expanding waistline. The best thing I've had their is their Chinese Chicken Salad. The serving size is a little ridiculous because it really is made for two people but it comes in one giant serving bowl. Despite the size, it really is delicious. It has the right amount of tang from the dressing and savoriness from the chicken that makes this carnivore skip the burgers and order the salad.  The one drawback about this place is that it's really small. The outdoor patio area is much more comfortable in terms of elbow space but you're sitting on cheap plastic chairs. Inside you'll be lucky if you're not elbow to elbow with the patron next to you.  Love going to this place when the temperature is nice outside and having a convenient low-key dinner, a middle ground between fast food and fancy restaurant.

Restaurant: Came at night and the restaurant and decor was what was expected, lively and a little loud.  Service: Was seated right away. Server was very quick and food came out quickly. Drink refills were done timely.  Food: Ordered the spinach dip. It was excellent. Sampled some of the other food from friends' plates and they were all good.

I'm a big fan of food network. I've been excited to try this place for a little while now. The service quick and friendly. The atmosphere was nice enough for a small local joint.   The thing about a place like this is that it's all about the food. I wouldn't say it s the greatest thing I've ever had, but it is much better than the chain restaurants. The food has the taste of homemade to it. The waffles and pancakes have a lightness to it that you can't seem to get in chain restaurants or from the supermarket. They have real maple syrup and the taste just can't be duplicated. The chicken that came with the chicken and waffles was not very seasoned, which I liked, but others may not if they are expecting a ton of flavor from it.  Overall, I'd like to give it a 3.5 but will round up to a 4. I'd go again every once in a while but I wouldn't necessarily make it a regular.

Went to Floyd's on a Friday night. The restaurant was pretty full but we were seated right away, which was nice on a Friday night. The waitress got our drinks quickly and our order shortly afterwards. However, this is when my experience started to go downhill. My girlfriend ordered a cheese pizza. I was going to order the turkey burger but the waitress warned me that it took them the longest to cook. Instead, I ordered the cheeseburger, medium. We then waited at least 45 minutes but could not find our waitress anywhere. I knew something had to be wrong. I don't think a cheeseburger and cheese pizza should take this long. I stopped another waitress and was told that our waitress had already gone off shift. The new waitress went to check on our food and came back to tell us they were still cooking it.  Why would a medium burger and cheese pizza take that long? We finally got our food about 15 minutes later. All in all, it took over an hour to finally get our food. No apologies were provided other than they submitted our order during a "rush". My cheeseburger came out well-done, but at this point I was so hungry I didn't want to send it back. There was no attempt at all to apologize for the issues. It is unfortunate the service was so bad because the food was relatively good (if they would have cooked it right). I do not think I will ever come back here as there are other restaurants in the area that are much better.

Went here with my girlfriend during restaurant week. It was a Sunday evening which may be why the restaurant was mostly empty except for two other couples. The decor is very modern with splashes of color here and there. Nothing that made me say wow but it was nice.  The service was excellent on this day. I'm not sure if it was because of how empty it was but our server was always on top of our refills and getting our dishes out of the way. We happened to make a comment on how it seemed the caeser had too much of a mayo taste and the manager comped our drinks which we did not intend at all. Overall, we felt taken care of without feeling like our server was hovering over us.  We had the flatbread appetizer which was ok but was salty. The chorizo already brought a good flavor to the dish but the chef also added sea salt to the spinach which was overkill. I had the strip steak done medium rare and it came out perfectly. A little on the bland side but it was still very good. My girlfriend had the steak frites. I had a few bites of it and thought it was really good also, however, she was turned off by the bright green color of the chimichurri sauce. The trio dessert was ok, nothing to write home about.  Overall, I think it is a great restaurant to try during restaurant week. I think the regular pricing is a little high for this type of restaurant but it appears to be in line with other restaurants in downtown, especially one connected to a Westin.

Went here on a Saturday night with a couple of friends. It was very busy that night and we had to wait about 30 minutes for our seats. We were able to get drinks from the bar to pass our time though. Our waiter was quick to help us take our order. We ordered more drinks and an appetizer while we waited for our entrees. An hour goes by and no entrees. Our waiter glances at us every 15 minutes but does not say anything to us. We finally ask about our entrees and he claims the kitchen staff accidentally placed our order in the completed pile. He did comp our drinks and appetizer though. Not entirely sure if it's worth it to come back here.

I received a Groupon for Christmas as a gift. Several calls and an email to Chad have not had any response. I think it's poor customer service if you can't at least respond by email or return a call. Will be requesting Groupon provide a refund.

Upfront disclaimer: I am good friends with the chef/owner of The Cafeteria but this review would remain the same even if I weren't.  My wife and I just had our rehearsal dinner catered here at the restaurant. I have to say that it could not have turned out better. The staff really went out of their way to make our vision come true. We were thinking "Italian villa" and that was captured perfectly. The place looked terrific and we were getting compliments as soon as people began arriving. The ambiance was perfect.  From the salad and soup course through the entrees and then the dessert, everything tasted terrific. Everyone at our dinner could not stop raving about how delicious the food was. We even had several requests to see if we could somehow get the recipes from the chef!  I cannot say enough about this place and the people who work here. I don't think our rehearsal dinner could have been any better. Our special night, prior to our special day, was one of the most memorable and wonderful days of my life. Thank you to everyone at The Cafeteria.
