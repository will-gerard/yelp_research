I had been meaning to visit this place for awhile and the only regret I have is that it took me so long to swing by and have a taste.  They have a decent and well priced lunch menu as well as a large assortment of Italian pasta and Japanese type entrees.  After debating the tonkatsu lunch versus the ramen and roll combo, I ordered a bowl of ramen and california roll for $8.45.  I was very seriously surprised by the ramen broth which was excellent and also by the fact that the noodles were perfectly al dente.  My friend got the champon, which is traditionally found in Chinese restaurants  Definitely can't wait to go back and try more menu items.

Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable.

Had been wanting to try Marcellino's for awhile, but the last time we tried, it was closed as the owners were away in Italy.  Finally got around to a very overdue visit tonight.  Dinner was excellent. Started with a special app, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in proscuito served with roasted peppers, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes.  It was perfect.  The mozzarella tasted home-made.  Tried the mushroom linguine and red lingunie for entrees.  All of the pastas are made by hand in the restuarant.  Both dishes were very good.   Rounded out the perfect meal with a perfect slice of tiramisu.  They also gave a number of service items including, bruschetta with fresh tomatoes and basil before the app, and a shot of homemade limoncello with biscotti after desert.  With wine, it was about $65 pp which was reasonable.

Been here twice now.  The views are absolutely amazing.  Even if you don't want to come for dinner, it has a great patio lounge that you can come to for drinks.  Its not a bar scene, but more of a place to go and get drinks with good friends.  The food has ranged from excellent to good.  I had possibly the best lemon drop martini of my life here.  The seafood dishes are excellent.  I also ordered a brussel sprout salad which was amazing.  The steak was ok.  I've had better.  Would definitely recommend this place for a quiet dinner with good friends.  Try to get a table that faces outward.  Its really all about the view.

I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old that have attended this school now for 9 months.   I would have given them 5 stars, but our experience here has been mildly mixed. Generally speaking, the school does a very good job teaching very young students how to swim and  be safe in the water. However, service quality depends on the time of day you go and teaching expertise depends on who you get.  Our younger son is in semi-private lessons right now which is required for his age.  His teacher Ed, is phenomenal.  Flat-out AMAZING.  He is fun, he is a great teacher, he is attentive and gives the kids 100% of himself as a teacher.  Usually we struggle to get our 2 year old out of the house, but when I tell him we're going to swim and see Ed, he's practically running to the door.   If all teachers were like him, I would give this school a 5-star.  However, my other son has had some mixed experiences.  He has had very good teachers and very bad teachers.  On our last make up, the teacher was staring out the window for most of the class, barked commands at him the whole time and finished his lesson a few minutes early .  This is not our normal experience here, but in my mind, this should never happen.  His usual teacher is much more attentive and caring. Generally, you have the same teacher every week, but for make-up sessions the teachers will vary and on occasion, teachers will call-out sick.    We pay $181 per month right now for 2 kids.  It feels like a lot of money, but when you break it down it averages about $21/kid/week which I think is very reasonable.  The lessons are 30 minutes.  If possible, I would recommend that you try to get lessons during the weekdays in the morning.  The front desk folks during this time are very nice and personal and it is not too crowded.  Afternoons tend to be very crowded.  There is usually about a 5 minute wait for the showers in the afternoon which doesn't seem like a lot, but remember you are in line with a wet and shivering kid or two.  The desk girls are usually less experienced in the afternoons.  Some of the afternoon desk girls are flat out rude and immature.  But I guess with any large company, you always have a bad employee or two.   Overall, I would recommend this place.  It is not perfect but it is the best swim school we have been to.

Had heard a lot of great things about this place, so the hubby and I decided to try it for Valentine's Day this year.  Not sure what happened in the communication, but I am sure that we won't be going back. To start out with, I was upset about the FLYING COCKROACH that crawled out of my salad.  I had to flag down three waiters to remove the item from my table.  No one wanted to help until I actually found my own waiter.  They replace the chopped salad with a new one, which was mediocre at best.  After the salad and before the entree, ANOTHER COCKROACH walked off of our table, which is when I yelled for help.  The owner came by and made a joke of it; there was no apology.  In retrospect, I should have walked out.  Perhaps I'll just call the Department of Health?

I LOVE this store.  LOVE it.  I've visited many light stores in the valley including all the stores that start with "H" and multiple stores on Scottsdale Road slightly north of the Kierland area as well as Lowe's and Home Depot.  The quality, range, selection and price are absolutely phenomenal.  In early summer they have a fan sale, 2 for the price of 3.  The price starts right above Home Depot pricing for lights, but the quality is far better than what you can find at the chain stores.  If you are shopping for lights, definitely need to make a stop here.

What a pleasant surprise - to find an authentic Cuban restaurant in the state of Arizona!!!!  I had the typical beef plate with rice and beans and maduros.  I've been thinking about the maduros all week long!!!! Pretty standard Cuban food and it was excellent.  It lead me to ask the waitress where the owners are from - one is from New York and the other Cuba which is why the food is really really authentic.  We topped the food off with a really good pitcher of sangria while a Cuban band played live Cuban music in front of us.  For me, this was a 4 star night.  This is a very casual place  My only complaint is that it is sort of pricey.  Two entrees, a half pitcher of sangria and 2 appetizers was over $80.   We'll absolutely go back again!!!

Mmmmm  mmmmm mmmmm.  OMG.  Where do I start? When I was little, we lived next door to an old Italian couple.  The wife would cook "gravy" every week and once in awhile she would invite us over to have some pasta and gravy.  Well, let just say, eating pasta at Giuseppe's was like visiting my childhood all over again.  I hadn't had gravy like this since I was a kid.  This place was so good that I went there two days in a row last week.  The menu is very simple and the pasta is cooked to al dente perfection.  On my first trip, I ordered chicken parm with a side of mostaciolli.    The second trip we tried the Pasta Alex which was very good and the Italian sausage.  They made up plates of spaghetti with butter and parm for the kids.  It is very kid friendly.  And on the way out, my kids were given complimentary Italian ices from the owner Pasquale.   Love this place!!!!  Oh, and it is BYOB!!!  :)

I'm very sorry fellow yelpers, but the yelp rating on thie place has left  me in quite a quandry.  After moving to the east side of the valley, hubby and I were looking for a new "neighborhood sushi" that was closer than Glendale.  On the positive side,  this place is authentically Japanese.  The sushi selection was just OK on the night that we went.  The fish:rice ratio was right on.  The rolls were not over-stuffed with rice either.  They have a very good selection of sake and authentic appetizers.  More importantly the selections ranged quite a bit in freshness and quality.  Some of the more expensive nigiri pieces were very good, but the $2.95 nigiri menu items were awful such as the eel and the ebi.     In my book, selling old and bad fish is inexcusable at any cost.  Unfortunately, our search for the neighborhood sushi restaurant continues.

This has become our "neighborhood" Thai place, although its not really in my hood - but totally worth the drive.  I normally get the pad see ew (sometimes known as Drunken Noodle).  It is very good as are their curries.  Everything tastes very authentic and thankfully not "Americanized".  We ordered their catfish last night which wasn't up to par - but nothing to get salty about.  They also have lunch specials that are well priced.

This place is solid.  Not amazing, but solid.  Its actually owned by a Korean family and not a Japanese family - and you'll notice it in the details but overall we had a good experience here.   We ordered a lot of things which ranged in flavor and quality.  Here is the skinny... Rice:fish ratio (sushi only) - perfect Fish quality - ok to excellent; salmon and yellowtail were ok - yellowtail belly, large scallops and  mirugai were excellent.   Rolls were ok  - we had two specialty rolls; most of them come as "spicy" which I personally don't enjoy.  Tempura veggies:  excellent.  The service was great.  The restaurant was clean...will most likely become our new neighborhood sushi joint.  Glad to have found this place with the help of my fellow yelpers.

There are nights when I have dreams of the glorious aisles of Super H-mart (not in Phoenix) and there are other nights when I am totally rooting for the mom and pop shops that where I can buy homemade mandoo for my little kiddies and give them a taste of the homeland.  That being said, this is one of those mom and pop shops that I want to love, but have come to like instead.  The mandoo at this place rocks.  The price has gone up a little since the first post - bag of 50 runs about $13 now.   I've tried various bahnchan with mixed experiences- some were too sweet (doh rah jee), some had too much dasheedah and others were good (bi bim bap veggie mix).  I've tried the naeng-myun kimchee which was excellent and bought a jar of the regular kimchee which I didn't like as much - very very bitter.    All in all, I'm happy this place exists.  This is my little Korean food oasis that saves me from driving 45 minutes to the Mesa area for good Korean groceries.

I would have to say that this place is an Arizona 5-star yelp rating.  In NYC, this would be a solid 4.  That out of the way, I've been here 3 times now and can say that the fish has always been very fresh on all three visits.  The sake selection is great.  Our favorite is the one from Toyama, which is the hometown of the owner in Japan.  If you plan to go here frequently, you can buy a large bottle and they will save it for you.  There are two things that make this place much more pleasant to go to than Yasu.  The first is the originality in the menu items.  They have an orange tuna avocado with orange-mizo glaze that I love. Mo also makes a salmon avocado roll with and entire diced soft shell crab on top.  All three times, I have ordered the omakase here.  And all three times, I have had new menu items.  Also, all three times, I have sat at the bar which to me is a must if you are going to get omakase.  The second thing that makes this place officially my favorite sushi spot in AZ is the owner and chef, Mo.  He is really friendly and on our second visit he remembered us.  Because of him, the whole restaurant has a laid-back, friendly appeal unlike places like Roka-Akor and Yasu which have more of an arrogant flair.  This is definitely my favorite sushi joint in the valley.   Can't wait to go again.

What a disappointment.  We started off with fresh, yet strange tasting guac.  They make it at your table - avocado, lime (not enough), onions, cilantro and dried cranberries.  Yes, dried cranberries.  Sound funny?  Well, let me tell you, it tastes just as funny as it sounds.  Its a very weird sensation to be eating guacamole with chips and chewing on cranberries.   I wanted it to work out, but it just didn't. I ordered the seafood enchiladas for my entree.  They were so banal that I didn't even go for dessert.  I do have to mention that I tried my husband's duck entree and it was pretty darn good.  But still, that means this place is batting .33 which is not a good record for a moderate-high priced Mexican restaurant.    Also, I would rate this a $$$ and not a $$.

This review is for the Echo Canyon Trail.  I'm still sore from the hike 2 days ago - it kicked my fat bum but it was an awesome hike.     My comments: - This is a hard hike.  I thought it was really hard.  There are large portions of the hike when you are using hands and feet to climb the rocks.  There were a few obnoxious folks that ran all the way up and all the way down (as far as I could tell), but some folks didn't make it to the top.  Also, I saw quite a few folks with fresh open cuts and wearing other evidence of falls.   - Wear hiking boots if you have them.  Ankle support is very important on a hike like this where you are not really on a dirt path, but more so stepping on lots of random rocks. - Bring 1L of water and a protein snack.  I was dreaming that there would be a hamburger stand at the top, or better yet, an icecream truck.  No such luck.  Instead I stood there and salivated while I watched another woman eat her Luna bar.  I almost offered her $20 for the last bite, but decided against it. - The views are wonderful, so bring a camera if you can.   - I don't recommend this for kids less than 6-7 years, at the very youngest.  I saw quite a few kids on the trail and asked their parents how old they were.  The youngest was 5 - she was too young.  Another kid that looked about 8 years had a huge bloody gash on his knee.  I probably won't take my boys till they are 7 or 8 years old. - I wore jeans.  At first I was envious of the folks in comfy, fashionable athletic shorts and yoga pants, but on my way down, I was very grateful for my jeans.  There were many parts that were too steep to walk down, so I sort of slid on my butt.  For once, I was thankful for the extra padding on my big bum and a thick pair of jeans on my seat.    Lastly, parking was hard.  We ended parking about 1/2 to 3/4 miles down on Tatum.  Make sure to eat a hearty meal before you go.  Otherwise, happy hiking!

After about 5 visits to Yasu, I have decided to give them four stars.  The food there very good.  They have a wide variety of items ranging from tempura, to robata to sushi and other grilled fish and pork belly, which is commonly cooked in Asian homes, but hard to find in restaurants.  The food is always prepared very well.  I've had  a variety of grilled fish.  Most recently we had a grilled black snapper.  It was done to perfection.  The tempura is very good - the batter is perfect in consistency, not too thick, not too thin.  The sushi is also very good - a bit plain, but fresh.  They do have the yasu salmon sushi which is a seared salmon with a ponzu sauce on top.  It is one Yasu's more creative sushi's but in the overall scheme of creative sushi, its nothing to write home about.    I also like the beer selection here.  They serve Orion and Ichigo.  Ichigo is a rice beer that is very hard to find.  Sake selection is just OK.  Yasu's weakest point is the waitstaff and the service.  I have to agree with many yelpers that the service is mediocre at best.  For this reason,  I deducted a full star.  The waitstaff are not very well trained for the caliber of restaurant that Yasu is trying to be.  If you are the type of person that wants service pronto, this is not the place to visit.  However, if you want a relaxing evening and have time for a long dinner, I would recommend Yasu.

Any good Chinese restaurant will have 2 menus - the "americanized" one and the "authentic" one.  The owner of this place will give you the "American" one if she doesn't know you.  I can't comment on this menu since I have never ordered anything off of it.  Enter the "authentic" menu.  I have no idea what "Wahsun" means, but I think it should mean "the magic wok".  There is an exceptional smokey flavor to all of the dishes that are stir fried at this place.  I sometimes wonder if there is a  flavoring ingredient called special-smokey-flavored-wok-crack that just keeps me going back for more.  I experienced possibly the best lo mein outside of NYC which is quite phenomenal for this part of Phoenix.  It had a very authentic flavor, all dente, almost crisp egg noodles with the perfect mix of Chinese greens.   The walnut shrimp (w/mayo) was a dish I haven't seen in a few years and was done very very well.  We also ordered the steamed whole fish flounder which was just ok.  They can also put things together that are not on the menu.  On my first visit, I asked for chicken and chinese broccoli and they hooked it up.    Of note, this place is cash only.  Don't expect anything more than hole-in-the-wall decor -  fully clad with sticky lazy-susans which just makes me love this place even more!

Wowsers.  Like, jeepers, but WOWSERS.  Have you ever watched the movie Ratatouille?  There is a scene where, Ego, the food critic takes a bite of Remy's ratatouille and it wafts him back to his mother's kitchen.  Well, one bite of the food here and I had wafted back  to Flushing, New York.  We had the whole steamed sea bass from the tank.  We asked for a large fish.  It comes at market price.  They price is based on the weight of the fish. They cook it up with a soy sauce, ginger, scallion juice that is out of this world.  Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm.   We also asked for authentic chinese greens and whatever they brought us was outstanding (it was not bok choy, yu choy, chinese broccolli or anything similar to those three).  I would have asked what they were if I had not done carry out.  Our last dish was like a beef - bo luc loc dish.  Very very tender.  On the drier side.  I'm not a huge fan of sauceless meats, but it was very well done.  Bravo.   I fully agree with a previous review that this may be the most authentic chinese food in the valley.   Note: The food here is very authentic.  If you are looking for Panda express type food (general tso, lo mein, fried rice, etc), this may not be the place for you.

There is always a first - and this was my first experience with Americanized Vietnamese food.  It didn't taste awful, it just wasn't very authentic.  We ordered a bun dish, a tilapia dish and a bowl of pho.  I may possibly go back for the pho, but that would be about it.

Doesn't hurt to get your car washed here.  Gas is pretty well priced too, usually a few cents more than Costco.  Car wash prices are OK for the service you get, but still what I consider, not cheap.  Had to take off two stars for "Danny's Glass" which is at that same location.  DO NOT have your glass fixed here.  I had a small CLEAR chip on my windshield..  They offered to fill it for $40.  I should have stopped them when they took the drill out.  Now I have a an opaque drill hole, and a clear chip and a larger divot than before.  I complained to the manager and he told me to call corporate offices for a refund.  How annoying.

Not a huge fan of a restaurant that has "PHO" in its name and it runs out of Pho on BOTH visits.  The other non-pho items were ok.  The service is awful.  Don't plan on going back.

I'm so glad to find this place already had reviews because I had no idea what it was called and would have never found it otherwise.  We call it "the $5 carwash"  at our house.  Love it.  5 bucks for a car wash and do it yourself vacuum.  Really can't beat this price.  I also like that you stay in your car during the wash, especially, when you have small kids and its such an ordeal to get them all in and out.  They towel dry your car at the end.  So happy this place is near my home.

This was my 6th move in 7 years.  I have had three moves in the northeast and three moves in the south/southwest.   In the local movers category, this was the best moving agency I have used.  I self packed and had the movers move the stuff.  I am not sure if they offer full-pack service.  They were on time, professional, gentle with the goods and worked in a timely manner.  I'm not sure what else to ask of from a mover.  The price was very reasonable and right on with the estimate.  I will use them again.

Well, at least the owner is consistent.  As with Roka Akor, this place had great style in the decor, but the food just was not very good.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and a curry.  Both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced, but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries.  It almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot, the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute.  Maybe its the old school in me, but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind.  The search continues for good Indian food in my hood...

There is not a lot that I can say that hasn't already been written about, but if you are on a dairy free diet, this IS the PLACE for frozen confections.  They have a very good  selection of homemade dairy free sorbets.  Coconut, pineapple, chocolate, lime mojito are some of the current flavors which are all excellent.  This place has found the magical balance between flavor and sweetness in their sorbets which is pretty hard to do.  Some other menu items for non-dairy foodies include homemade marshmallows which they can roast for you.  They also have a chocolate sorbet/ice cream made with a goat's milk base.

I had possibly one of the best birthday cakes at a friend's son's birthday party last spring - so I asked my friend where she got the cake and she directed me to Sugar Lips.  I decided to splurge a little and have Ironman cakes made for our sons' joint birthday party.  Wow, I'm not sure what happened between last spring and this month, but the cakes were both such disappointments.  To begin with, there was clearly a HUGE miscommunication about the cake design.  I should have drawn it out instead of verbally explaining what I wanted.  It was supposed to be cartoon style.  I had asked for the caption box to be completely white with black lettering.  While they followed the directions for one cake, they did not for the other.  I had asked for the cake to be in "landscape" orientation.  It was not.  I had asked for the gray background on the red ironman cake to match the grey on the grey ironman cake.  They were two different colors. I did not ask for "girly" embellishments on the side.  They were put there without notice.  I had asked for solid background, it was not completely solid  And finally, the cake was DRY.  Very dry, actually.  I would have been better off a grocery store cake.  The cakes together cost $100 which is not too bad for custom cakes, if they are good.  But since they were not, I really felt like I wasted a lot of money and time to drive out to this bakery which is very far from where we live.

Solid com tam (broken rice).  That's all I really need to say.  They have just about every variation of broken rice platter you can think of and its served as it should be.  The shredded pork is very good as well as the egg cakes and egg rolls.   They do NOT have pho.  But they do have a wide variety of bun dishes that are not as good as the com tam dishes.  Prices are great.

Where oh where would I be without the amazing world of YelpI  After seeing all of the great reviews we decided to check this place out with the kiddos in tow.  Loved everything about it - the menu, the decor and especially the happy hour deals.   Starting with the drinks, we enjoyed the sangria, the negro modelo on draft and fresh watermelon juice for the kids.  Many (possibly all) of their ingredients are from local vendors and therefore very fresh.  We had the shrimp ceviche appetizer and various tacos - halibut, shrimp, pork and beef.  The kids had something called a chicharron which is like a huge letter-paper size chip made of cheese.  They had a good time eating it as well as cheese quesadillas off of the sides menu.  It was a little far for us, but this is a great place to meet folks and do happy hour.

My sweet hubby brought me here for my b-day the other night.  Note, this is a Scottsdale 5 star, otherwise known as a Chicago, California, or New York 4 star rating.  This may possibly be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Amazing food.  Unpretentious and cozy atmosphere.  Got the steak frites.  Asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans.  It was excellent.  We asked for a smooth red wine.  I had possibly my second best red wine ever.  We also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots.  Both were cooked almost to perfection - however lacking in salt for my personal preference, which is an easy fix.   I would definitely go back.  Don't recommend this for large parties.  However, it is the perfect place for smaller, intimate parties.

Jim Jeon is a Korean stylist that relocated from L.A. to the valley about 1 year ago.  He offers haircuts for men, women and children.  He also does magic and digital perms.  His prices are very good.  Between my kids and myself, we've visited JJ at least half-dozen times since it has opened.  Our experiences have varied.  My sons have had some of their best cuts here as well as very mediocre cuts here.  I have had the same experience.  I would definitely recommend this place to for a magic straight perm.  Mine turned out great.  He generally does an excellent job if you are first timer (for cuts), but it is best to try to go when he is not busy if you want to guarantee that you get a good cut on a repeat visit.

agh.  Not exactly what I would consider "Korean" food.  Ordered various sushi's, the chicken bulgogi, and the soft tofu stew.  When the chicken bulgogi came out, I explained that we did not order chicken teriyaki but the chicken bulgogi.  The waitress explained that they serve teriyaki for bulgogi because that is what "American" people like better.   Really?  Really?!  Sushi was not fresh and tofu stew less than mediocre.  Should have cooked at home.  When I say that, you have got to know the food was bad.

I have to agree with all of the other reviewers, in terms of customer service, hands down Bedrosians is amazing. Prior to visiting Bedrosians, I visited multiple well known stone and tile stores in Tempe, North Scottsdale and Phoenix.  I told my cabinet maker that I was really having hard time finding anything good and he recommended Bedrosians.   I worked with Iliana for flooring and Savanah for slab.  Both of them are amazing.  Their prices are comparable to the other store but their selection is excellent.  We purchased a 16" x 32" porcelain tile that is just beautiful.  Other well known stores had nothing larger than 12" x 24".  You don't need an appt but I would recommend making one as they do get very busy.  They wholesale to a lot of the smaller kitchen and slab stores, so I recommend stopping by rather than buying from a middle man.

Don't waste your time.  Tried the crepes, a holiday cookie, ice cream and coffee.  Nothing special.  Crepes were mediocre.  Kids all took one bite of the cookie and claimed it tasted strange.  Most of the cookie went in the trash.  Not worth the wait, the calories or the trouble of figuring out which line goes where.

Called in Chris at epic game truck for my son's 10th birthday.  Got the 2 hour package.  I texted him the morning of the event to confirm he was coming and he texted right back to confirm.  He arrived about 20 min early to set up.  I didn't play any games but the kids said it was awesome.  The truck fits 16 kids but we probably had closer to 20 (age 6-10 years old).  Chris made sure the kids took turns and had an even amount of time.  Truck was very clean and new.  Would definitely call him again.

Hit his place before a concert at the Mesa Arts Center.  Seriously, the best empanada that I've ever had.  Got the El Capitan and the the chicken veggies empanadas.  The outer skin is nice and thin - not super thick and doughy like a lot of other places.   The restaurant has a laid back vibe.  The service is excellent.  We had about 45 minutes to eat and had entrees and dessert out in no time.  One of the owners, Marco was there waiting tables and making sure guests had everything they needed.  I think it's really nice when the owners help with the day to day and make sure all of the details are taken care of.  Will definitely be back when we see our next concert at the Mesa Arts Center.

Had great pizza.  Tried to call this weekend and I was on hold forever which is totally unusual.  So I called their other location to see what was up.  Camelback location is "temporarily" closed.  They wouldn't give me a reason.  The owner should change the phone message to let customers know what is going on - especially if they really are opening up again.

I'm so grateful to have found this place for my three boys and now my husband.  We see Ali who does an amazing fade but who can also do a great shaggy cut for my kid w soft hair.   I think they take appointments early in the week but walk-ins only on weekends.

Took our Accord here to get tinted.  While the tint color was as expected, we had some bubbles.  They did tell us to go back in 2 weeks if the bubbles didn't go away.  However, the tiny bubbles were not the biggest issue, the worst part of the tint is the back window - now we're seeing double out of the back window.  Not sure what happened, but I am sure that I don't want them to touch my windows anymore.

Worst soon tofu in the Valley.  If I lived in the area, I would consider going back just for drinks late at night but not again for food.
