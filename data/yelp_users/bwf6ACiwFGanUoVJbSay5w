Amazing place!!!!  I car died right in front of their shop---- Literally!!  I ran in they ran out and pushed the car in.  Well I was with a new client and we had a schedule to keep SO  Within 15 minutes they checked my car in, gave me a rental, transferred all my stuff from one car to the other and I was on my way!    They even had a technician take my car home to make sure the car was behaving like it should after the repair.    Great friendly staff and completely made my day by being so quick.

This place is ridiculously good.  The service is impeccable!  Order artichokes when available. Order chicken Caesar salad or the corn bread.  Whatever you order will be fantastic

Been to the service center twice for my 2015 Corolla. Everyone is always very helpful and ready when I arrive. Keep up the good work!!!!

I had a virus on my computer.  I went into Best Buy off Frank Lloyd Wright and 101 for help.  The sales person recommended Kaspersky Anti-Virus.  I purchased the $40 product.  Once home I could not install the anti-virus and had to purchase a different anti-virus program that did work.    I went to return the software (their word for it) and the would NOT return my money because I opened it.    So let me be clear--- a product their staff recommended DID NOT work and I can't get a refund.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service.    I would have written a great review had the done the right thing but they didn't so I shall now tell everyone how horrible they treat their customers.

I have been twice--- The family business was warm and inviting.  I had two pieces of jewelry to be repaired and they did it with a smile.    I am not in the market for big jewelry items but as soon as I need something I will be running right up to them!!    Thanks for the smiles and the help.    They have beautiful items... Ladies :)
