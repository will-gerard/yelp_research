Super fast, lots of vegetarian options, and the meat options aren't bad either.  I've never had a bad sandwich or salad here.  The staff is always friendly, and the toffee chocolate chip cookies are super good.  I am also confused by the fuss about the prices, because I find Crave to be on par with or even a bit cheaper than...every other sandwich joint I've been to in my life.  Additional shout-outs to: the caesar salad and roasted pepper/brie sandwich.

I enjoy being at MacAlpine's.  This really isn't something I can say for most restaurants in Phoenix.  I like to linger and hang out due to the charming, lived-in atmosphere, the forgotten Andrews Sisters hits on the stereo, and the people-watching.  This is a place where you (I) go for certain things only.  I'm not a huge fan of the food because it's not my style.  It's the kind of stuff my grandmother fixed for lunch on summer vacations.  Plain, old fashioned fare.  If you are nostalgic for white bread and mayo, then get to MacAlpine's NOW.  That said, I have had some good sandwiches there, and I like a place that doesn't serve unnecessarily gigantic portions of food.  The service is always very friendly and pleasant, and they have some good stuff in the two antiques shops on either side of the restaurant.    Here is what I want from MacAlpine's:  Get a website! Oh my god!  (& when you do, put your menu on it)  And secondly, I'm pretty sure they don't serve espresso drinks right now, despite the fact that I believe I have noticed an espresso machine behind the counter.  If I'm right about that, I should be proven wrong post haste.  I would really like to be able to get lattes at MacAlpine's, because I'm just not a malt, phosphate or egg cream kind of lady.

Lonnie's has a nice supply of materials and tools, and if you're into jewelry-making, you'll probably find something to buy there.  Unfortunately, you're gonna have to wait for it.  Service is slow, and not always friendly.  The staff generally won't look at or speak to you as you stand there waiting for the interminable line to move, and they aren't any nicer when it is your turn.  I've been there many times, and this is the case every. effing. time.  Service is important to me, so I only go to Lonnie's when I need something now and they happen to be open.  Otherwise, I'd rather give my money to people with manners.

It's easy to get a person on the phone at Midfirst, but it turns out that speaking to a human being doesn't mean you'll be treated like one.  I've had three significant experiences at this bank in which the customer service was so low, it wasn't even there.    First, I spoke to someone about an auto refi who simply would not contact me back.  She would always tell me she was going to call, and then she wouldn't.  I ended up handling it with another bank.  She never followed up to find out.  I guess they're doing so well that they don't need any more ~extra business~!  Secondly, I ordered a new debit card because they were running some kind of promo for the design cards.  You know, picture of a flower, your dog, etc.  Card never came.  I called them a month later, they cancelled it and sent another.  Card never came.  I called them a month later, they had no idea what was going on, and I told them to forget it.  NO FANCY CARD FOR ME.  Third, there was a snafu between Midfirst and another bank that I use.  Midfirst was obviously completely to blame for the incident, but instead, the people I spoke with on the phone petulantly insisted that it was either my fault or the other bank's, but not theirs.  This went on for weeks, and ultimately, they did nothing to fix the problem or to retain my business.  Again, Midfirst must be doing REALLY WELL to just fling off customers like this.  It was such a minor issue that I could not believe not only the thinly veiled hostility from the people I spoke with, but that they would be so petty and ridiculous instead of just fixing the issue.  I'm not kidding when I say it could have been an easy fix.  I'm flexible!  But not when they are so openly unwilling to do the least thing to retain a customer.  Instead, they fought with me like a middle school frienemy, and I am closing my account in disgust.  Almost every interaction that I have had with this bank has been annoying, and unusually devoid of customer service.  They don't even pretend over at the old Camelback location.    In closing, worthless quality of service, time wasted, total mistake, closing account, do not recommend.

No complaints.  After observing a sudden change in my cat's behavior and weight, I decided that I wanted someone to see her right away.  Ingleside was the third area vet I called (based on yelp reviews) and the only one that was able to get her in today.  The front desk service was super friendly and accommodating and the building is clean, bright and airy, unlike every other vet's office I've been to, ever.  There was plenty of room to avoid the other animals.  The Dr. (Bart? that's probably relevant but I don't remember) was attentive, gentle with my flipped-out cat, and presented all of my options (and the prices) for the available tests to figure out what was wrong.  The pricing was what I expected: a little over $200 for the visit and blood tests.    Overall, it was very smooth and quick and I would definitely bring my animals back here.

Super impressed with them.  They got me in at the last minute, and had the car ready to go by the time that I requested (before, actually), despite the fact that they had to do a bunch of extra work that we hadn't anticipated.    They were friendly, straight-forward, very good about communicating, and reasonably priced.  Usually, at least 1 to 4 of these criteria are missing when I visit other shops.  Excellent experience!  I'll be back.  Soon.

Unfortunately, I've had to visit Select twice in a year and half.  Damn Phoenix drivers!  If one more person hits this poor car, I will turn into the Hulk and kill them.  Now that that's out of the way -  On both occasions, Select staff were extremely friendly and helpful, particularly when guiding me through the insurance process, about which I knew nothing.  My car looks excellent.  They do not use aftermarket products and didn't allow the other guy's adjuster to try to sneak any in.    Select staff definitely go above and beyond the call.  On both of my visits, they made minor repairs to my car that were unrelated to the accidents, just to be nice!  They also washed and detailed the car, and returned my rental car for me.  These little things went a long way to relieve my general stress about the situation.  I wouldn't think twice about coming back or recommending them to anyone!

For me, Durant's is a drinking bar.  Not only is the menu unappetizing and contrived (to me!), but the flavors are blah.  Not bad, but blah.  I realize that their aim is to remain classic, chic, simple and distinctly American, so the things that I dislike about the menu are not exactly a deduction in my mind.  In other words, don't go there expecting artisanal, innovative food selections.  Expect steak, potatoes, and incalculable calories.  The drinks, however, are impeccably good.  The bartenders are career bartenders.  I've been going to Durant's for about 9 years, and it's usually the same two faces every time.  They are not overtly warm to everyone, and I feel that your chances of getting sassed by them are much higher if you are a younger person, but most of the time they're nice.   The bar is warm and cozy to me, I love the dim lighting, the famous decor, and the mingled scents of meat and coffee remind me of my grandmother's kitchen.    The assortment of people is fascinating, but there's always one sloppily wasted lawyer or other downtown denizen shouting about his divorce or John McCain to bring you down.  Ignore him.

I've been going to Lux for years.  It's always been #1.  It is terrrribly, painfully hip, but somehow it isn't uncomfortable there, and there really isn't a snide vibe that I have detected in my billion visits (oh and I would have).  I stopped going for a while prior to the big move because it was constantly packed, with lines out the door and internet speed that was reminiscent of mid-90s dial-up.  I rediscovered how much I liked making french-pressed coffee at home.  I've been around, coffee-wise, and Lux is always the best.  In fact, I'm so used to Lux, that when I get a crappy drink somewhere else, I assume that something out of the ordinary has happened, because it is so bad.  Repeat visits to offending spots (Lola, Lucy's) has confirmed that, no, they didn't make a mistake - they just suck.  Also, Lux's whipped cream is TO DIE.  I don't even like whipped cream, but you should see what happens when they forget to add it.

The menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.  Here's my problem with Matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?    I've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.    Not worth the wait.

I can only imagine that people who approve of this library have never been to libraries in other cities.    It's dirty, it smells, and it's generally filled with people who can't behave.  There are payphones in reading areas.  Children scream and cry.  The staff seem miserable.  The audiobooks orders seem to be made by Ann Coulter.    If you want to be propositioned, bothered, harassed, asked for money or perhaps attacked in the bathroom, then by all means, do go.

I'm pretty happy with this place overall; drinks are good, service is friendly, atmosphere is enjoyable, and I delight in the immediate neighborhood, where I inevitably have to park.    My one complaint: though they do technically stock rice milk, they never actually have it.  What gives!  I'm tired of coffee places thinking it's adequate to offer soy as the only dairy alternative.  I ask for it every time and every time they are still out.  C'mon guys, this game is not difficult.

I've used this store for years because it is very conveniently located to me.  The inventory is decent; sometimes I find what I'm looking for, and sometimes not.  Unfortunately, over the five years since I found the place, the customer service has been consistently bad.  They seem affronted if you ask them a question, and offer limited help and almost no suggestions.  I have waited for awkward minutes to pay at the counter while the employee finishes up with whatever beadwork she is doing at the little table behind it.    Additionally, it is commonplace to be watched like a hawk as you shop, apparently no matter how many times you have been or how many hundreds of dollars you have spent there over the years.  Maybe this was special treatment for me, being younger than they are, and wearing whatever grubby day-off gear I may have had on.  It's no excuse, obviously, particularly for such a special interest store, which should be on its knees in gratitude for every body that walks through the door.    In fairness, I do recall at least one or two instances in which I have been treated courteously (by the same person each time), but it doesn't quite offset the begrudging treatment from the other bats.

First of all, the sushi counter is incredible.  Really!  I don't know what it is, but those guys win at sushi.  Everything is super fresh and well-prepared.  The prices are pretty average, but they cut them down a little bit every day between 2:30 and 4:00 or something like that.  The guys are friendly, but they'll give you shit if you sit down at 2:15 and expect the lower prices.    As for groceries, watch out.  I think some of that stuff just doesn't move and ends up sitting on the shelf for too long.  I have gotten things home only to find that they taste strange and are clearly old.  Also, the prices are always absolutely unreasonable, even with common items that can be had anywhere.    Service is always great, though.  The people are friendly and efficient.

Sorry, but I have to do this.  I have had good sushi experiences so many times at this place, but one near-death event really helps to wipe those memories away.  I got food poisoning from the sushi bar.  I know it was the sushi bar, because the only other thing I had eaten that day was toast.  By the time I finished the roll, my stomach was already starting to feel weird - how contaminated does that stuff have to be if it causes your body IMMEDIATE PAIN?  Whatever was wrong with this fish was super wrong, because I vomited on the hour all night (I had the sushi for lunch) and well into the next morning.    I called and spoke to the manager who was vaguely sympathetic, but otherwise very breezy and unconcerned.  He told me he'd refund my meal the next time I went in, but rolling in there with no receipt and a half-hearted promise from a guy on the phone seems like the makings for an annoying situation.  I can't ever eat their sushi again, which is unfortunate for me, but this episode was SO VERY BAD AND PAINFUL that I simply can't take the risk and I wouldn't encourage anyone else to either.

I feel conflicted about this store.  I've gone there on and off over the years and have over that time spent hundreds of dollars there, but I still feel irked about some really sub-par customer service.  Every time I pass it and consider going in, I find that the bad taste still remains, and continue on my way.  The items have range, from the absurdly-priced to the reasonable, from wallets for guys to baby stuff to seasonal home decor.  I have found a lot of cute jewelry pieces which have made great little gifts for gal pals.  Some of them have even been affordable.    That said, the owner is particularly rude and snotty.  I purchased a dress there once that I decided was too unflattering to keep once I got it home.  Imagine that, a 2x2 dimly lit dressing stall steered me astray!  I brought it back several days later at my leisure and was immediately asked (by the owner) if I had worn it.  I was taken aback but said no, that it was visibly unworn, and the tags were even attached in such a way that to hide them would have been impossible.  She clearly did not want to return the dress yet did so anyway, but only after informing me that, "We are not Nordstrom."  Outrageous!    I like to shop local first as much as the next guy, but this woman can suck it, and so can her business.  Your mileage may vary, however, as I have found the service from her employees to be far more courteous and helpful.

I'm really torn between three and four stars, so I decided round up due to no specifically bad experiences.  Like most other reviewers, I switched to Melrose from Walg's because I like to buy local first.  Unfortunately, Melrose keeps pretty stingy hours; it would be nice if they stayed open an extra hour or so during the week, and they are only open for a few hours on Saturday.  No Sunday.  C'mon!  Obviously, any loyal patrons of Melrose are sacrificing the ridiculous availability of Walgreen's and other pharmacies, so you would think Melrose could crank out another hour a day to prevent poor fools like me from having to drive like a maniac and cut through traffic to get there after work!  Anyway, they are courteous, but I wouldn't say anyone has been falling over themselves to thank me for my business.  On my first visit, I filled a new prescription for a topical skin care product.  The girl at the counter kind of blinked at the price and asked me if I was aware of the cost.  I was not.  She told me she'd research the price a little bit and call me.  My prescription called for a small tube, but she later informed me that a much larger size cost the same amount with my insurance, and would I like to just get the larger quantity?   I really appreciated the extra few moments she took to investigate the product to find the best option for me, and to warn me about the pricing!    I don't need to visit my pharmacy much more than once a month, so I am content to remain with Melrose, but I think that the sheer tightness of the hours would probably drive me elsewhere if I was having to be in there frequently.  The inside is cute and clean with some interesting products, but I think it would be nice if they carried more things like locally-made soaps and bath products.  The retail selection in there seems to be quite random, with no cohesion to the presentation.

Great experience!  I was motivated to change the locks on my house when my purse (containing all of my keys and address) was stolen.  Jeff was here in a couple of hours and swiftly switched the locks.  He was highly professional and took care to test the way the lock turned over in the door once he was finished, showing me what he was talking about. This is the only guy I'm going to call for any future locksmithing needs.

Good!  I always get the falafel platter, or plate, or whatever.  It comes with falafel, fluffy rice, and lemon baked potatoes.  It also comes with a greek salad, a tub of tahini, and some pita slices.  What I don't like: the greek salad comes utterly covered in sauce and feta.  As in, the entire top of the salad is white.  I realize this is a mega-bonus for some, but I avoid dairy, so I normally just give the salad away or sub it for fries, which are very good.  Everything else in the salad is fresh and crisp.  I also really don't like the tahini...or, I think it's tahini.  It is super sharp and heavy tasting, not really what I'm used to in the tahini-department, and is really thick.  Spackle-thick.  The potatoes are amazing.  So very good.  I asked if they use butter in them and got an answer of "probably not."  Not quite the answer I'm looking for, but I agree - probably not.  The pitas are fresh and delicious.  The falafel is always pretty good.    You're gonna wait.  Especially if they're busy.  Prepare to sit in the drive through for 15 minutes.  I always see the same two young guys working the counter, and they are always very friendly and gracious.

Over Easy doesn't have enough good vegetarian or vegan options.  Would it kill you restauranteurs to put ONE really good vegan thing on? That being said, they make some tasty food at reasonable (but not specifically cheap) prices.  My personal favorite: the Selena burrito.  This is a gigantic burrito that comes with whatever you want, but the base item is shredded hash browns.  I omit the meat and usually get tomatoes and onions added and I love it.  It is two meals.  The burritos come with a small cup of fruit, and wouldn't you know it, it's GOOD fruit!  Not the standard stingy fruit cup of watery, old melon slices with a few sad red grapes.  No way.  This fruit cup includes lots of fresh blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries alongside the typical sad fruit items (I hate melons and grapes).  Dang!  It's in the details and this one really impressed me.  We ordered for work once and they were friendly and fast (if not slightly strained) with our 25-meal order.  There wasn't a single mistake in the food items or the bill.  A record?  Probably.

Obviously Whole Foods is losing an entire star due to the inordinately high prices, HOWEVER: I go there for things I can't get anywhere else and I know that.  They have me in a headlock.  They have the best goddamn salad bar/deli/prepared foods/whatever.  There are always vegan options, which are delicious and interesting and save me from trying to kill myself because I can't eat cheese.  Speaking of which, WF is also the only place where I have been able to find TRULY vegan cheese.  All of the fake cheeses at Trader Joe's still contain milk caseins.  The produce is always fresh, another thing I can't say about TJ's.  The array of items is so dazzling and diverse that I cannot leave there without spending $50 or more.  The service is always friendly and helpful.    Really, what I dislike most about the store is there's too much good shit to buy, and I'm not made of money here.

I've had the same set of belongings moved professionally about 4 times now.  This was the slowest move I have ever experienced.  After a while, it occurred to me that they might actually be doing this on purpose just to increase the rate.  I can't imagine any other reason why it would have taken so long.  They did a lot of standing around and looking, and slowly walked each box to the truck.  There were no stairs.  The path from door to truck was probably around 25 or 30 feet.  I packed each box to be a reasonable weight, knowing I'd have to carry them around to unpack them eventually.  This move was easy.  To move a small apartment, completely packed, to a storage facility a few miles away took 3 hours.  Minimal large furniture.  In fact, my mother and I once moved the same stuff ourselves, and even that took more like two hours.  The fastest move I've had was barely an hour and a half, also with only two guys.  What the hell, man?  I also observed irresponsible methods of piling stuff which at one point involved leaning a mirror precariously at the top of a 6' pile of boxes.  COME ON YOU GUYS.    A couple of days later, the office called for my review of the move.  I told the (kind of rude) guy that I felt it was unusually slow.  He sounded flustered as he told me he didn't have my paperwork in front of him, and that he'd have to call me the next day.  Because he can't hear the story without the paperwork apparently, which he should have had in front of him in the first place before calling, but don't let me tell them how to do their jobs.  He never called back.    I would not use them again, nor can I recommend them positively to anyone due to the super slow move and the total customer service fumble that followed it.

Camelback contacted me almost immediately following my poor review to discuss my experience.  Chad was very understanding and eager to make things right.  I was definitely impressed with the sincere and proactive response.  I'll have to chalk my experience up to a rare "off" day as Camelback's business practices seem to be top notch.  Thanks again to Chad at Camelback Moving for reaching out to resolve this matter!

This place is the best.    First of all, nobody beats that $20 bruschetta and wine deal on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The bruschetta is delicious, there's a ton of it, and the wine doesn't come from a "bargain menu".  This deal makes the day-specific special offers of other restaurants look stingy and pitiful.   Everything I've had there is delicious and the service is always great.  My only complaints are the casualties of visiting an awesome place: the wait for seating, and for the bathroom.  I'm not used to waiting 45 minutes to get in to a place, but I'll do it for Postino.

The place is bright and cute (too cute in my opinion), the staff is friendly, and the wifi is free.  Unfortunately, the espresso drinks are horrendous.    I gave this place two tries separated by a couple of months, with different baristas and the same unfortunate conclusion.  My lattes tasted the way I imagine wet cardboard tastes.  Had to be tossed.  Sorry Luci's, I tried.    Too yupstery anyway.

I like Moira.  I've only had sushi there, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu.  The fish is fresh, I especially like the yellowtail.  It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but I have no specific complaints about it, and that is saying something.    The service is always attentive and friendly.  I really have nothing negative to say here other than the chairs are too high at the sushi bar.  I feel like a child in a high chair since I pretty much need someone to push me in once I'm in the chair!  Oh and the music is always just a little too loud.  It's never more than half full there, and that is too bad.  I think people just don't know about it.  It's in kind of a lonely spot on McKinley and easy to miss if you're not watching for it.

As a Lux devotee, it took me a long time to check this place out, but I went in with an open mind.  My drink was so bad (iced soy latte) that I'm going to be real generous here and assume that Something Was Amiss or the barista was new or something.  I ended up having to toss it.  How did they mess up something so basic?  HOW.  The girl at the register was not friendly.  At all.  The wait for the drink seemed absurdly long considering I was the only person there (again with the new barista theory).  I expected a lot more from the interior.  It was all right, quite airy, but basically bland and boring.  Microscopically cheaper than Lux, but I regret wasting my money there and won't be back.

Was this place a Chuck E Cheese before?  I tested Arcadia Tavern out for a mid-week happy hour and it was wall to wall kids.  Little kids.  This is not what I am looking for when I roll to a bar at the end of the day to booze-kill my horrible work week.  It's clearly their aim, however, as every table contained at least two kids and they have wiis and toys set up in a back area of the restaurant for them.  Legos and blocks flying all over the place.  They serve the draught beer in these absurdly oversized heavy margarita glasses.  I had to hold my glass with both hands just like the toddlers all around me.  I ordered chicken strips which I am positive came frozen from Costco.  A friend ordered the bruschetta board, the presentation of which was pretty awful but clearly a blatant rip on Postino.  I tried their salami and pesto (sounds familiar) and the mascarpone and prosciutto, neither was very impressive.  The server was forgetful and rather dotty, doing things like taking two out of three drink orders and suddenly walking away.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.

I feel like I came on the wrong day.  The kid at the register was very slow-moving and inattentive.  There was definitely no effort coming from this guy.  I ordered a sandwich to go and he gave it to me on a plate, then put it in a plastic box which started to melt on the bottom from the heat.    The sandwich was totally tasteless and generally not good.  It was definitely a "waste of money" situation.  My latte was ok, but not exactly competition for my regular hangouts.  I'll try it again if I'm ever in the area and looking, but definitely no special visits.

I dig it.  I've been many times now and have never had a bad experience.  Service is always friendly.  They have a great beer selection, ranging from Mickey's (yes) on up.  The atmosphere is good and the music is usually good.  To people who haven't been, I sometimes say that it's like The Roosevelt, except much, much better.  Sorry, Roosevelt.  The tuna sandwich is amazing!  I generally avoid dairy and eggs, but I order this tuna anyway and I don't ask them to alter it (hard-boiled eggs in the salad, havarti on the sandwich) because it works, it is incredible, and I cease to care when I am there.  The only other menu items I can comment on are the hot dog - good but frankly a little upscale for me when it comes to hot dogs- and the chocolate brownie which is, of course, very good.  My biggest complaint is that the food selection is not the greatest for vegetarians and vegans.  The restaurant was converted from a cute old home in the Coronado district and has a nice patio.  They have a pretty good happy hour deal, but I can't remember what it is at this time.  This is a place I'm always interested in visiting.

I love Dr. Harman!  I have been through three other dentists in three years and finally have found someone who is competent, professional AND friendly.  I don't know what it is with dentists, but there are a lot of rejects out there.  I'm never kept waiting forever, and all of the staff is extremely friendly.  The Dr. asks more questions than my prior dentists have, and actually seems to be paying attention to what's going on in my mouth.  For example, no one has ever probed around in there looking for indications of oral cancers, which I have confirmed with other pals who see him is apparently part of his regular routine.    Definitely recommend!

The first time I went was not good.  They seem to have found their stride, however, and that is water under the bridge.  One of the best happy hour menus around, for real for real.  The prices are great and the selection is good.  It is ALWAYS very busy during happy hour, but don't even bother on Fridays.  It's jam-packed with tarted up Scottsdale flotsam and the servers are frazzled beyond belief and prone to forgetting your drinks.    Everything here is good, except for the crunchy spicy tuna roll, which seems to be a Stingray original.  And it is original...but strange, and a big fail in my opinion.  The moto-rolla (or something like that) roll is BEYOND. JUST BEYOND. I think about it wistfully at least once a week.    Service depends...I almost always have the same girl, and she is the best waitress in the world.  Wish I could remember her name.  Badass Asian chick.  All of the other servers I have had have forgotten items and generally kind of sucked.  Oh and the interior is pretty cool.  I am mesmerized by the huge silver fish behind the bar.

The waitstaff has come off as fairly miserable on my last few visits.  The food is either not great or inedible due to inaccurately described spiciness levels.  The last time I went, I ordered the chilaquiles off the board.  I know this dish can vary greatly between establishments, but I've had excellent luck up until now and I order it whenever I see it.  It was awful.  Firstly, it came on a plate that was about 2' long.  Thanks for the head's up, waitress.  Secondly, the eggs were so incredibly spicy that I could not eat them.  Any of them.  Since the egg portion of the meal was the size of a regular dinner plate, this was a lot of waste.  The waitress apparently thought so too, because she became agitated when I declined her offer to box it up.    I told her I didn't want them because I couldn't eat them, because they were incredibly goddamned spicy.  She ignored that part and asked me if I would perhaps want to eat them later.  I said I figured they'd still be spicy then.  Then she asked me if I could take them home to someone.  I said I would never give this food to my animals.  THEN SHE TESTILY ASKED IF I KNEW SOMEONE ELSE I COULD GIVE THEM TO.  This B really didn't want to see the food go to waste, but wasn't super concerned that I had just purchased pounds of food that I hated.  I said no, that I wouldn't be ringing up my phone tree to see who likes their eggs with an entire jalapeño, and as she began to angrily suggest yet another option for the reuse of the food, my dining partner interjected and said that jesus christ he would just take the bloody eggs.  Waitress needs to STFU.  Seriously?  Seriously.  This isn't the first time I've been served something I couldn't eat.  I know it's ~Richardson's~, but write "spicy" on the goddamned menu when something is spicy.  Just do it.  As for the waitress, sister needs to research some food outreach programs to volunteer for.  She's wasting too much of her vigor being shitty to customers about eggs.

They make a good latte here, which is something I feel the need to mark after being unpleasantly surprised over and over by inexplicably disgusting results elsewhere.  (HOW HARD IS IT, LUCY AND LOLA?)  I've been here three times, and the service was fast and friendly on each visit.    I don't think I'm a fan of the crepes, not through any particular fault of Jobot, but they're just not my steeze.  I had the one with cheese, tomatoes, and onions, and it was delicious, but much too heavy and greasy for my life.  Also, what the fuck even is crepe?    Crepes aside, Jobot is a strong place.  Happy with them.

I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.  Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was "forced" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not "qualify" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.  The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.  They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today.

Really underwhelmed with the quality of cleaning here.  There were several visible dirt spots on my tile floors when they finished.  There was also a dull, dingy cast where they had "mopped," if mopping consists of lightly dragging a wet microfiber over most areas of the floor.  They offered to come back the same day when I complained, but I had already left work to let them in and had no time in my schedule for some office dispatcher to come to my house to look at my floors and decide if she felt they were clean.  I expect thorough work, but by no means have an unrealistic expectation here.  A reasonable effort is good enough for me, but what Molly Maid did fell far, far short of that.    I expressed clearly but politely how deeply disappointed I was in the quality and got what essentially amounted to a shrug and an insincere "Sorry!"  I can't imagine ever paying again for this quality of service.  After they left, I felt like they had just used a bunch of dirty mops around my house, and I ended up redoing the floors myself.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.  Maybe my cleaning experience was unusually bad, but that's the part where good customer service is supposed to come in.    Nope!

I had my third gel manicure ever here, and it has lasted perfectly for about 16 days so far.  My prior manicures looked all right, but started to peel up around my cuticles after a week, making it impossible not to peel them off, which I immediately regretted.   Considering that the quality of service and atmosphere are so much better than the usual crappy salon, the prices at Exclusive are super reasonable.  Super, super reasonable.  The manicure has even lasted through my very damaging hobby of jewelry making, which includes being exposed to various chemicals, and being hit with the metal file every so often when my hand slips!  The only reason I'll be having it taken off soon is because I can't stand for my nails to grow past a certain length.  If not for the growing nails, this manicure shows no signs of degradation.  Pretty impressive.  Highly recommend!
