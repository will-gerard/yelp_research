Love this venue. There are some really reasonably priced hotels within walking distance, and plenty of bars/clubs between which make for a perfect bar crawl to the venue. (You can hit the Crescent Ballroom, Seamus McCaffrey's, and Copper Blue, to name only a few...)...  We came here to see NIN and found the venue to be clean, staffed by really friendly people, and well organized. Lots of stands set up for drinks/food/merchandise and plenty of water fountains and bathrooms. The acoustics were great and the show was amazing.

I hate this airport. In many, many ways. Parking is the devil...picking up people is awful..getting stuck in that never ending loop of hell that goes around and around the airport is awful...I dread having to come here.   If you use it as a connection, it's fine...but getting dropped off or picked up is not.  I was picking up a child- the father went in, a staff member gave me complimentary 30 min. parking for a lot...drove to the lot, got lost on the way...tried to get out and the pass was void. Has a massive line behind me trying to get out..had to jump out of my car to get an attendant who told me I was doing it wrong (I wasn't)...very embarrassing. She had to override the system...  Went to a cell-phone lot where you can't leave your car..the flight was delayed and I really had to use the restroom-I asked security if I could leave my car and to please please not ticket me- he said he has no control over that! haha great.   Finally went back to pick up my friend...had to push through three lanes or almost stand-still cars to get to the curb..all in a lifted truck.   Awesome time!

Love this place! Great bartenders, staff and great drinks. This place actually has character and the crowd is pretty fun- we made some great bar friends while we were here (the inexpensive drinks and beer concoctions helped in this friendship, no doubt).  It was pretty mellow when we came early in the night before a show we were heading to at the US Airways Center. The bartender was great- even gave us his personalized mini-map of the area with all his bar recommendations. Very cool! We came back after the show and it was rammed, but the staff was still friendly and we had hardly any wait at the bar, event though we were standing 4 people back.  Great place!

A girlfriend and I came here after seeing their Groupon (13$ for 20$)....when we arrived the restaurant was packed inside and out, but the hostess seated us very quickly.   We were super thirsty from too much pool/champagne time and it felt like days before we even got water (I would guess 15-20 minutes..which is still quite a lot). After we ordered it took another 45 minutes or so for the food to come out- again, pretty crazy since most of the options are breakfast themed. How long does it take to cook an egg?  I had the chicken salad sandwich and Mexican soup..the soup was so salty it was almost inedible, but compared tot he super super bland chicken salad sandwich,. I guess I was happy it was at least seasoned. There was so little chicken salad on the sandwich that after taking the top peice of bread off, then the bottom, I literally had 2 bites from each side. No exaggeration. Someone had taken the time to dice the apples and other ingredients into perfect tiny cubes, which shows tons of effort...but the super small portion given and the fact that it wasn't seasoned made all that work seem pointless.  My friend had the corn beef hash..she left most of it- absolutely no seasoning again. It was the blandest corned beef hash I've ever tasted. She also had a Chai tea- again, no flavor, so she was dumping sugar and such into it trying to pep it up.   We spent another 15 minutes trying to get the bill- then did the universal My Tab Is Sitting Halfway Over the Edge of the Table so the Waitress Will See it Move...and she still didn't see it, so I had to flag her down.   I would say she was friendly, but overall poor service for the long wait time. By the time we got our plates, most of the restaurant was empty, so it's not like they were in the middle of a rush.

Came for Ellie Goulding- the show was totally fun, but I'm totally annoyed at drink prices. I paid almost 30 $ for three shots of fireball. COME ON. ....and then for some odd reason I felt the need to tip the bartender who pretty much ignored us and acted like it was a burden to pour the shots. Also, they came in tiny thimble sized plastic containers..yah, it was the correct pour, but looked cheap. For what I paid I want that stuff in their finest crystal.

I wasn't really impressed...It's a big enough space for the dogs to run, but it's just flat ground. I personally prefer the dog parks that have landscaping and other items in them. I heard while I was there that when it rains, the entire area fills with water, which after reading other reviews seems to happen once in a while.  Three stars because it's always good to get the dogs out to socialize...the people at the park were friendly, and there were no issues with aggressive dogs.  I did have a problem though with one family who had two small children....one aged about 2 and the other 5. They were approaching dogs and hugging them around the neck...made me cringe every time I saw it. This was in the large dog area...while my dog is great with small children, not all dogs are. Please use common sense people! What would have happened if the littlest one was in the middle of a few dogs playing aggressively, or heaven forbid a dog fight.

We stopped into Su Vino using a Groupon which was a super deal- tasting flight of 5 wines for two people + 1 appetizer at 15$. The appetizer alone cost about this much.   The location is really nice, set back off the main area a bit- they have outdoor seating as well as indoor and bar seats. We sat at the bar and got great service. The two men on staff were very friendly and we had a good chat with them while doing our tasting.  The wines tend to be on the sweeter side and they have some selections that are not what I'd choose to purchase myself, but it's fun to try them on the flight. Their Un-Oaked Chardonnay ($6 glass/$16 bottle) is crisp and clean, which I liked. We also tried the Razle Dazzle (sparkling wine $5 glass/$18 bottle) since we heard good things about it. I wouldn't order it at any point during a meal, but I would happily grab a bottle or two to drink with friends poolside- this stuff is sweet (but not sickly) and goes down easily.   They have two 'Summer Refreshment Selections' which are very sweet and fruity (as you can perhaps tell by their names; Summer Rain and Blue Breeze). We tried the Summer Rain ($5glass/$11.75 bottle)- nothing wrong with a Riesling..has apple flavors which is nice.   By far the best wines were the reds though. Their new release, Super Tuscan ($8.5 glass/$28.99 bottle) is very good, in my opinion. From what I remember it's a blend of Cab and ...ok I don't remember. It's nice though. The Bella Rossa ($8 glass/$24.5 bottle) was my husband's favorite. It has notes of chocolate and cherries.   I'm not a big fan of Port, but their Porto Cocoa ($8 glass/$24.99 bottle) was pretty interesting and well worth a try. Usually these things are sickly syrupy sweet, yet this somehow managed to not hit that mark, which is good.  It was our anniversary, so they gave us truffles (thank you!) to pair with our Port. Great way to finish the tasting.   A note on the food- it is yum, but they do have everything prepackaged ready to go- they are not actually going to be cooking anything, more like assembling it on a plate. For me, this was fine for the Antipasto platter (which was the perfect size for two people).   As added bonuses- they have a massive games table- you could buy a bottle and hang out for the afternoon which might be fun.

We came here a two weekends ago using a Groupon offer they had at the time (10$ off 20$ worth of food).  We thought the patio was lovely, sat outside to enjoy the weather, ordered some really nice red wines, at the recommendation of our server, and ordered the elk burger. ($14.95 Wyoming Elk, crispy shallots, spicy raspberry jalapeno ketchup). The burger was to die for. Literally the best burger I've had in years. So much flavor, properly cooked, with perfect accompaniments. We absolutely loved our meal and wine selections and were ready to rave about this place to our friends...  That is until the bill came. The total charge was $6.93 (thank you Groupon deal!). We paid with a $100 bill. The change came back...but in this massive pile of 5's and mostly 1's. No coins. Ok, that was odd...so we counted the bills. It was off by 19$ (and the coins).   We immediately waived the server over and said, "We think this change might have been miscounted..?" Totally nice about it. The server then goes behind the corner and comes out seconds later, placing a 20$ bill into the mess. He did not even count the bills that we handed over to him! Also, now we actually had an extra dollar..and still no coins...but whatever.   I REALLY, REALLY do not want to think he did this on purpose, but I am so sorry to say it seems as if he did. Why would he not count that massive wad of 1's and 5's and yet somehow know how much we were short changed?? We are under the impression that the server saw the new $100 bill we paid with and assumed that we wouldn't count the change that came back (especially since it was only 1's and 5's.) Also- who gives back change on a $100 in that manner? Exactly!   I am really sorry to leave a 1 star rating for this place as the food was STELLAR. Unfortunately, the service left a very bad taste in our mouths. Way to ruin an otherwise exceptional meal. :(

Loved the decor- came here on a bar crawl before a show and it was packed. We had no trouble getting a seat though (sat at the bar) and got service immediately even though it was pretty much standing room only. The bartender was friendly even though she was super busy and found time to pay attention to us even though she had many duties that evening.   They have a massive beer selection and great beers on draught as well. We did order some nice stuff, but they also had $3 pints of a really nice beer on tap, so we partook in a few of those as well. It's great to see the range in prices- something for everyone.   We even nabbed (ok, were given) glasses from a snazzy beer that they were discontinuing.    We will come back the next time we're in town.

Totally sick place- good food, cheap drinks, interesting beers on tap and friendly staff.  Came here before a show, drank and had a good time hanging out in a chill place, came back after the show for an after party. It was rammed with tons of people dancing to a DJ- no one was pushy or rude...pretty cool crowd. The drinks were being poured spicy. Like super spicy. Just how I like it. I'm pretty sure someone poured me straight rum. Thanks! (next day...not so much)....

Valley Car Group is a really great company to work with. I had two vehicles on Craigslist and had been approached several times by various dealers all of whom I turned away because they were pushy, offered me a ridiculous price on the cars, or treated me like I was an idiot because I'm female.  I was contacted by Valley Car Group who put me in touch the same day with their buying manager Jayson. Usually the turn around time from this point is days, but Jayson was willing to come that same day to look at the vehicle he was interested in. It's frustrating enough trying to juggle work/life/etc. while selling a car and trying to have interested buyers work with your schedule, but with Jayson he was willing to accommodate our needs and met us at our convenience.  He made the drive out to the house to see one car, and ended up going home with both my vehicles. He was super personable and easy to get along with and didn't talk down to me or act pushy in any way.  I honestly let the cars go for a bit lower than I had wanted simple because Jayson was so easy to deal with and I was tired of being jerked around by other dealers. It felt more like selling a car to a friend rather than a dealer.   Once we shook on the price, Jayson took care of the rest and went ahead of us to the bank, filled out all the necessary paperwork, and had everything ready for when we arrived.   Super simple, painless transaction- If this group contacts you to look at your vehicle, give them a shot. Very professional and down to earth people.
