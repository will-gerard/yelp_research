Had some great drinks here on Happy hours. Had the Emperor's margarita (try cucumber and strawberry combo) and the Dragonbite ( I think) really yummy? Also had the shrimp wonton tacos and Vegas roll. Service was excellent and place was clean! Ill be back!

Where do I begin. First the pictures do not depict what the actual "resort" looks like. This is an old Motel 6 type hotel with a basic pool in the middle. Photo shop must be a hobby of theirs, nothing looks tropical in person as it does online. When we arrived we were greeted by a young girl named Yvette. She seemed nice at first but you could tell her lack of experience and customer service. She informs us that it is her policy to have everyone's information that is staying in the room. I didn't have my ID on me at the moment and I didn't have my license plate # memorized so she made sure to tell me five different times to make sure I brought her my info. We went and took a look at our room. It was old and outdated, and hot! I am sure they knew they were assigning that room (according to them they were full), couldn't they have the air on even a little? We decided to try and get a little sun from what was left of it for the day and went to the pool. We were only out there for about an hour and went back to the room to shower and get ready for dinner. As we arrive in the room the phone rings and its Yvette demanding I give her my information. We reminded her we knew she needed it and will be down shortly. Before I knew it I had maintenance banging on my door demanding my information. I sent him away and told him we knew. A few minutes later he showed back up and I gave him the info. I also included my phone number and asked for the manager to call me. As we head to dinner less than a mile away, my GF gets a call from the manager Danny who immediately starts yelling at her and threatening us. We headed back there to get our stuff but needed police back up as we think he had a gun!  I wasn't gonna get shot! We waited for the police and when they arrive Danny made up all these crazy stories and said he STILL didn't have my info. First he said it was a state law, Then he said he has his own laws and bullish*t, Bullsh*t.The cops called him out on it. He was a total Bastar* We grabbed out stuff and left. I warn all of you do not go there. No customer service, they steal your money, and put extra charges on your card. Danny the manager has a hairline temper that is set to snap at any moment. Definitely not a good environment for children. STAY AWAY

I receive text messages from sonic with promotions re: new items , specials of the day etc.  I was in the mood for a sundae and went to grab one for me And a friend of mine.  When I mentioned the special price they said they werent  Offering that price. Once I explained it was a text/club prIce they asked me to pull forward.  After all 4 employees looked at my text message and they had their little pow wow they decided to give me the price.  When they handed me my sundaes, honest to God they basically took one sundae and split it into two!   So they scammed me but whatever !  I will Think twice about this location the next time I want to make an ice cream run!  I mean Come on, even at half price sonic your not losing and dinero dayum

Best Buy is doing a great job at keeping up with the turns of technology. People are giving bad reviews 1. Because their cheap and would rather save a few bucks by buying online 2. expect the Employees To read their minds- tell them what you need 3. Have no patience when it come To a busy store.  Sure I get it, customer service isn't what it USED to be. But stop hating on a company that tries. This location is always neat and clean, employees are attentive and will ACTUALLY stop a personal conversation to help you - that rarely happens anymore, and if you actually look around their prices are super competitive and have DROPPED drastically.  If you want amazing and Knowledgable service ask for Emmanuel in the home theatre department. If he doesn't restore your faith in customer service, your expectations are unrealistic

Wish I would have read the reviews in here prior to booking at his hotel. My experience was similar. Poor customer service, dirty no filthy facilities and rooms, and pictures are false advertisement. I would avoid this place like the plague, trust me even if you think your getting a good deal, your NOT in more ways than one!

Food was good, service was quick. I had the sweet and sour chicken combo which came with steamed rice (sub fried rice for $1 more), a square of wonton and egg roll. This was more than enough food and generous lunch portion. The sweet and sour chicken was moist and despite having a good amount of breading on it, it was still good. The fried rice wasn't too oily as other reviewers mentioned. The egg roll and wonton I probably could have lived without and will likely not order again. But for those who like egg rolls, these are large, vegetarian, and loaded with shredded and peppered cabbage. I am in this area weekly and will most likely be back to try other items.

Where do I begin.... We were just 2 in our party. First off service was super slow and everyone around us was served first, including larger parties. Our waitress was in attentive and seemed annoyed with any requests. We ordered 2 expensive dishes with lobster which was Not impressive, but the small steak was pretty good. I ordered a side house salad which was a waste of time and no where near worth the price. I sent it back and had to ask multiple times for it to be removed from the bill. The worst part of this trip and restaurant was with the bill. We asked if there was a military discount and they do offer one but only to the military id holder. EVERYWHERE else literally gives the discount to the entire bill, but nonetheless we were given a small discount to the cheapest entree but nothing else. The manager came over to the table and not only clarified the "rule" but made a point to mention that generally they don't give the discount to spouses. I am completely appauld by this behavior and disrespect to the military. Not only will I be sharing this story on multiple review sites I will be contacting corporate. I urge you not to give this place your business. It's not about the money it's a principle and respect. Oh I almost forgot, the manger and waitress acted like the discount came out of their personal check... Kudos to you for your company obsession.

Ok where do I start?!?  Awesome decor on the inside of the hotel. At night it's dark, almost creepy like a haunted house! Late night dance/dj areA. Cheap and good drinks.   Topless pool area! Small Pool but perfect for us. Food/appz from the bar were delicious!   If you like to go to bed early you may not want to sleep here due to late night music but I highly recommend it!

Great music, open all night, cheap but strong drinks, we always find ourselves ending a long night out here. Patrons are pretty laid back, some dance , some play poker, some eat BBQ. It's whatever you want. The bartenders are great but depending on if their boyfriend or friends are there, they may not keep the drinks coming as quick as you like. 4 stars

Pros  Nice building Good size chicken pieces Great music playing r & b Clean Large drink sizes Waffles were pretty good  Cons   A lot of staff yet one person checks on you  Extra charges to meal without serves telling Eggs with cheese and onions were nothing special Grits- needed lots of salt and butter and I never use salt  Credit/debit machine down right when I need to pay Asked to give cash then they asked to write my credit card number down? Racist Manager/Owner and he is African AMerican! Are they crazy this is still the hood?!?

This hotel is horrible! What was I thinking. Stayed here with a discounted rate. Room was dirty, stains on the carpet. T.V. Lost reception and their Wi-fi was NEVER working and was always being "checked on by staff" front desk didn't care what you needed and when asked to see the manager she or he was conveniently not available . You have to check out an iron from the front desk just in case your azz can't afford a $5 iron from Walmart and you choose to steal there used one. No staff able to bring you anything. A bunch of kids at the pool, unsupervised and running.   No fan in bathroom, shower door wouldnt close. No pool towels.  My list goes on. I agree with other reviewers and this joint is in need of a total  demolition.

Walked up to entrance. No line. Ignored by staff. Eventually Asked by 3 different people of we were hotel guests. They tried to charge us $30 per girl on a Sunday night. We had comp coupons which one should have gotten us all in, but the rude cashier said we each had to have one to get in. Once up the 50+ floors, we enter into a bar mainly filled with cliques of "kids" who looked between the ages of 16-20. Techno music blaring, no variety. Drinks super expensive!! Drunks harassing us, they still served him drinks! One star for cool white, curving designs in floor/ceiling. Waste of money, waste of time. Learn some f-in customer service staff

Very cool bar! Rooftop, spectacular views, heat lamps on the patio. Drinks expensive, but tasty. 2 different dj's. One inside, one outside. Never waited in line. Laid back crowd, danced with fly brothas one night and cowboys and girls another. Bartenders give a little flirt. Typical club entry fee for Vegas, so get there early and enjoy the whole night!

I have no clue why this hotel has 2.5 stars. They have underwent a multi million dollar renovation, twice rooms are modern yet urban. Colors or green, purple, yellow infuse the spacious rooms. If your able to get a view of Fremont street, it's fun to watch. The beds are so comfortable! Bathrooms are great. Modern sink outside of toilet with gorgeous tile work and unique    Faucet. Casino is great, new machines, could use a few more waitresses but what casino doesn't? Best part is, you can walk all over Fremont street and stumble safely home. Hotel is safe , security all over, valet parking

Fabulous, amazing, unbelievable, what else can I say. From start to finish your engaged not wanting to miss a single thing. You get wrapped up in the love story yet are always wondering how do they do all this!   Wonderful way to encorporate water with acrobatics.  A must see!!

Came here on a whim, don't ever eat Irish food to be honest. I was more than satisfied with my choices. I had the mussels on HH and the sea scallops. My friend had the fresh baked pretzels which were simply amazing. I'm not sure if anything we had was truly Irish, but whatever it was it was delicious. I would def. come here again.

I usually go to Tea, snow and coffee by Mekong, but I wanted to try this place. I ordered a avocado smoothie with Boba. The boba were good and sweet like honey. The smoothie was more like a slush and was not creamy at all. They said they make it with real avocados and condensed milk but there is no way there was any real ingredients in this. I didn't have the heart to return it and I am sure their teas are good and their slushies (of course that is if you order it that way) but the avocado smoothie was not good. Menu on the wall is huge and overwhelming. They had many categories of different types of drinks but I was just not impressed

Best service I've EVER had here. Sat in the bar, had three servers more than attentive. There was never a moment I was looking for anything. The food was hot and delicious. Ordered the rock lobster (amazing!) with snow crab legs and shrimp scampi. I told my server I'm never able to effectively open crab legs and bless his heart he grabbed gloves and offered to do it for me. Biscuits are great as usual but I am more impressed with the exemplary customer service today.... Kudos to this location and the management for getting it right! I will be back....

I Learned about this store from some co workers who said it was a great place for produce. When I finally made my way to check it out I was mad I waited so long. They have a variety of great produce, meats, health food items, supplements, even a bulk section. Prices are generally great for the produce and they seem very competitive with other store prices. I now come here once a week to stock up.  Today I went in to the store for just some small dinner items. I had been hearing about "The garden of life" products including the Raw protein powder. Fortunately for me (unfortunate for him lol) I stumbled upon Matt who graciously spent at least 20 minutes with me educating me on the products and answering any questions I had. He was knowledgable, honest, and very patient. He even have me coupons on top of the sale prices.   I was very impressed with Matt and his excellent customer service. Definitely  something that is a diamond in the rough these days.  So thank you Matt for your help and thank you Sprouts for hiring Matt and having great prices and products!

Great service, great food. Came in to watch a soccer match. Thy changed a big screen for us which was great, kept the drinks filled and attended to all needs. My only suggestion would be don't pile everyone so close to each other when the place isn't close to being full. We had an annoying kids kicking the booth behind us which was the same structure I was sitting in. It made me nauseated and the parents were too busy stuffing their faces.. not BWW fault but again space everyone out

Was pleasantly surprised by the excellent customer service at this location. It had been many years and many miles away since I've visited a Papa Murphy's... I have always enjoyed take and bake but the customer service I got here today is what will bring me back again and again. Great job! You guys are doing things right!

This was my second time here. They have a decent variety of flavors so you can usually find one you like. I was surprised to see some made with stevia, but they were just too sweet. I ended up getting the cotton candy flavor. It was good.  Yes they have sample cups so you can try different flavors before you make your final Choices   I would have given 5 stars for more options of yogurt flavors

Called ahead for appointment and still had to wait over 20 min. Chose a color and she wanted to do only one coat. The color was uneven and she seems upset that I asked for a second coat. At the end I have thick areas of gel on my nails and polish on my skin. 2 stars for good cuticle work although they use nothing but water. I doubt I will be back to this place. Prices high, no water offered, and they barely talk to you

Have lived within walking distance for 9 months and just made it in! I am so sorry we waited. For lunch they have $7 specials which include a small starter salad and an egg roll. I had the pad Thai and my husband had fried rice. Both were so good! I did a spice level of 4 and it was hot! I would caution starting low and add More if needed since you can't take spice out lol!   I also had Thai ice tea which was good but $3. I thought that was overpriced by a buck. Most Thai places don't charge that much. they also have a frequent visit card buy 4 get 1 free! Overall we will be back often !

Made a dinner visit this time. The place was a lot Busier , so if you have a large party I suggest get there early or call ahead and See if they will take a reservation.   It took longer for them to take our order and they werent as attentive I chose the pad Thai again and it was very good , and To my surprise my husband picked the duck.  That of course took a little extra time to cook.  I managed to get a bite or two of his duck and It was very good. I remember the last time I had duck and it was much More greasy and fatty so Thai Chili did it right!  As you know, yelp offers deals periodically and there happened to be one  For Thai Chili that night. It was only for $5 dollars off but hey every penny  Counts these days. The place also has a rewards program.   The staff told me I don't get ANY rewards with any kind of coupons. I thought um?!?! It's not like a groupon where you pay $20, get  $20 free..... It was only $5 bucks.  And there was no verbage on the yelp deal re: reward points,  I mean I still spent money right?!?! So here's the Math: 26.00 total bill minus $5 yelp coupon = $21.00 spent and ZERO Rewards.  I'm just saying

I attended a meeting here, first visit ever. This place was great. I was able to try multiple Appetizers including the bruschetta, steak skewer, and crab cake. All delicious. Then I tried their signature chop salad and I highly recommend it. For dinner I had the filet mignon which came with potatoes and a veggies.... Yumo... The other attendees ordered both scallops and the buttermilk chicken... All looked amazing. The dessert was nothing to brag about and def. not their strong suit. I had cypress Chardonnay (wow) and their coffee wAs amazing. I will def be back. They aren't cheap but the good was worth it...

I also have had too many bad services here. My first Swedish massage was a simple oil application and she didn't even touch my hands or feet. What Massage doesnt include feet. Then I had a "facial" where she cleanses my face, put on an exfoliating mask then a moisturizer. There were a lot of steps missed. And my hour facial was turned into 30 min. She also made comments to me about my skin which I felt were rude. I returned in about a month due to the package I had and the massage was better but I had to ask For my feet to be done and I had the exfoliating add on which entails a dry sponge like thing used on the body. She didn't do my whole body and It was a waste of money. Then the facial, I added a peel because I knew I wasn't going to get a real facial and long story short she didn't cleanse my face well and used something that caused me To break out. No extractions done nothing.  I too wondered about the licenses and if there was any real training.  For the record I am a licensed professional familiar with what the services should have been like.  Find another spot.

It's very entertaining reading the reviews on here. I have been to this location multiple times, this is my first review. The restaurant is very clean, decent in size not small as some reviewers say. Although I've been to locations in both Oregon and las Vegas which were bigger this is by no means "small" I have never waited, and I have always been given a booth, even today and I am alone! Most restaurants would refuse to give a solo person a booth. So that earns extra points. Within a few minutes I meet my waitress who brings me water without even asking. The happy hour menu is good, it uses to be great a year or so ago but they removed some of my favorites , but don't fret! The still have classics on there like lettuce wraps and fried green beans (2 of my personal favorites)   So today i ordered a glass of wine, the crispy green beans and the flaming won tons. The favors between the Fried veggie, the dipping sauce it comes with is like a ménage a tois in your mouth. Add in the sweet yet spicy flaming wontons and boom! Well you know what happens :)  The portions vs price ration is swell. No complaints here.   I am full yet tempted to order more just because it tastes so damn good.    I drafted this review with 4 stars, but decided I would love to end my mean with the banana spring roll dessert minus the banana rolls ( long story short teeth are sore and cant bite into things) my waitress what cool about it and have me exactly what I wanted! 5th star earned :)  I reccomend this joint and if you've been here in 2010 and gave it bad reviews, come in now in 2012 and see what you think!

I have encountered some of the rudest postal staff here. Hersha truly represented the stereotypical postal worker. She was rude, discriminatory, and unprofessional. I try to avoid the counter in general but I can assure you I will never be back to this location.. You all should be ashamed of how you treat people here.

We always eat here when staying at the plaza. We've never waited in line, the food in in large portions and delicious!  I usually get the chicken, mozzarella , and corn hash which comes with some eggs And a large yummy biscuits. The scrambles are eggcellent too. The juices are fresh squeezed we love the orange and tangerine and the coffee is fantastic. I've had the s'more mocha( you've never seen anything like this) and the ice tractor coffee.  Wait Til you see the pancakes! They're folding over the plate!  I've seen burgers, sage chicken and waffles all piled high at the tables around me. You really can't Go wrong! Try one Dish today and A new one on your next visit!

Very disappointed in this place especially after reading all the rave reviews. Asked the server what she recommends and she said the skillets were popular. I ordered the chicken, mushroom and spinach skillet and I felt that it had been fried in an oven. I couldn't even eat the potatoes underneath the eggs and toppings. My friend and I also shared an order Of pancakes which were large an tasted pretty good but the syrup tasted fake and commercial. My bill was $15 after splitting and it was a waste of my money... Wish I knew what people were raving about on here but unfortunately I won't be back to find out..

" dayum gina" "finger-lickin good" "OMG"  These don't even begin to describe the food here. Lemme start with the menu: I posted a photo for all to see but you have at least 15-18 different flavors to choose from between seasonings and sauces, oodles of sides from fries, fried okra, Mac and cheese bites, corn bites aka hush puppies, etc etc etc.  For drinks they have soda, tea and (drumroll please) KOOL AID!!!  Oh yes my friends I said it.  So now that I've briefed you, lemme tell you what we got.  Wings of course. The best flavor to tantalize my tongue so far....  LEMON PEPPER! Oh yes- seasoned perfectly, crunchy in all the right places.  I also tried the garlic parmesan and seasoned flavors as well. Very good but you see the LP got my #1 vote   We also got a side of fries which were good too!  Now for my last item of review you must excuse my profanity   But the Honey Biscuits were orgasmic!  Think beignet/donut drizzled in honey and sprinkled with powder sugar.  Hot damn, next time im feeling lonely, ATL wings just prepare me an order of your honey love!  You won't be disappointed!  Like they say at the restaurants:  Good food takes time. We aren't slow, your just impatient!  Hahahah hell yea I'm ready for these wingz

Had a wonderful time here trying different wines with the cheese board. The staff was kind and attentive. I really enjoyed the white wines and my friend loved the refreshment wines. The shop is small and very cute. I felt comfortable and the wine was excellent quality. I look forward to coming back here! The location is in the shopping center near the Albertsons and not hard to find. My gps took me right to it. Looking forward to going back.

Staff is very friendly, salon is clean. Great color selection. Have been here twice now and the second experience was a little better than the first. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want. It is your nails and you should leave with them how you want. I asked for a few changes on my nails and she did them. All in all great service, prices, and location in the easy valley . I will be back

I feel its only fair to update my review. I haven't been here in a few years because despite my loyalty and appointments, I was never prioritized as a client. It got to the point where I would receive a phone call 30 min to an hour prior to my scheduled appointment asking me to come in later. My life is busy and there is a reason I make appointments and keep a schedule. I will say the first time she made this request, I agreed to come in a little later only to wait 30-45 minutes for her to finish another client.  She did this repeatedly until I finally decided I wont go back, she obviously doesn't value my business or me.

This is one of the rudest Starbucks I've been to in this country... I am so tired of employees acting like they are butt hurt when a customer asks for something. The first time I came here my drink was horrible and the barista was bent out of shape because I complained. Today their whole stamp card thing is ridiculous. Your selling 8-12oz of milk and espresso for 10x mark up... Honestly drive to the next location or Barnes and noble.... I will not be back to this location ever.....

Had a mani pedi here the other day for the first Time: the location is good for me. The pedicure was standard, nothing to brag about. My gel manicure looks great. I asked for some nail art and let that girl do her thing. I'm very happy with the outcome. I did ask for the package they offer which provides a very small discount for getting two service but was charged more in the end. Over all the quality of my gel manicure is above average for this part of town. I will be back

Came for dinner, staff was kind. PLace was spacious with lots of televisions for sporting events. Menu looked to have a variety. We ordered the Gorgonzola Alfredo with chicken. There was no Gorgonzola flavor to it. Due to the time ( almost closing) and our schedule we just paid for it and left. We also got the stuffed mushrooms which stated they were stuffed with sirloin.... That should state ground sirloin. We were led to believe otherwise. My friend also got a raspberry tea which was a tart green tea, she didn't drink yet we paid for. I called and spoke to a manager the next day who acknowledge there were Kitchen staff changes yet offered no service recovery. Our check was over $50... I am not sure ill be back considering...

Attended a group function last night. The parking lot is packed so make sure to have ample time to look for parking of be prepared to walk a ways. The restaurant itself is very classy, dim lighting, beautiful art in the walls. Large patio area and quite spacious inside. Service was excellent. I had the leg of lamb gyro which was very good. The Greek fries were also tasty. The menu offers appetizers, modestly price gyros and salads and a menu of entrees in the upper range. It seems everyone at the table ordered something different but it all look amazing. The food did seem to lean a little more Greek but one could argue there is a Mediterranean flair In some of the other dishes. There is a happy hour I intend to try during the week. My only complaint was the extremely short "by the glass" wine list. There was only 4 available and not one Greek option. As a wine drink that was disappointing. All in all I highly recommend and look forward to returning.
