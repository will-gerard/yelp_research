Fail!   Fail!   Fail!  I will probably regret this post (much like a drunk dial) later, but the facts are the facts.  I had a cosmetic removal procedure done last week and over the weekend my stitches popped open. My daughter was like, "Mom, your boo-boo is bleeding. Low and behold, one of my sutures popped open. Graphic I know, but it is necessary to illustrate the severity of the situation, and to give you a worst case scenario analysis of Stockton Dermatology.   So, I called Stockton Dermatology and the phone service said they wereclosed and you can't leave a message. Also, there was no number in case of emergency except a referral to 911. So, I went to Urgent Care and they tell me they can't help me because I got the stitches somewhere else. Really?!? I will have to review them later. Anyways, I went to the ER and after a 2 hour wait and a $100 copay all ended well.   Next step was to cancel follow up at Stockton Dermatology since I already got the stitches out at the ER. Well here was the nail in the coffin for Stockton Dermatology. You can't reach a person on the phone. They are suppose to open their phone lines at 8am on Mondays, but this was not the case. I called at 8:02, 8:05...( and this wasn't Althea time, this was real and actual time. Anyways, after getting frustrated at the fact you can't leave a message to cancel an appointment I let it go until noon when I tried again. Well, now their phone lines are closed due to lunch between 11:30 and 1p! I get breaks...I get normal business hours, but if you are offering surgical procedures you should offer some assistance in case something happens! I am not asking to have a person pick up on the first ring when I call, but some human contact and acknowledgment would be nice.   In short, since I can't reach you via phone, I would like to take this opportunity to cancel my appointment for today via Yelp.

So...I wasn't going to review Joe's because it has been done and everything that needs to be said is duly noted in the 110 reviews before me, but it has now been like 4 days and I can't stop craving the barbecue chicken pizza. Maybe it is just because I am on an after holiday diet, but maybe, just maybe it is due to the winning combination of thin crust (without being like a cracker), barbecued chicken, onions, and Gorgonzola cheese crumbles. Yum!  Besides that, Joe's offers the complete experience. It is a blast from the past, and the perfect date spot for all those clueless guys who want to land a lady that likes the outdoors, picnics, and simple pleasures.  When you visit, you are going to be tempted by the grilled peanut butter + banana split under Farm Favorites. It sounds like horrible goodness, and it is worth getting to say you tried it, but nothing to write home about. In short it is a total stoner sandwich and maybe someday I will have a use for it, but I will not be ordering it again as there are so many other yummy sounding things to pick from on the menu.

You know those little, hidden treasures that you find that are so close to where you work or live?  They make you both super excited and a little bit nervous because you know that they are going to test your ever wavering will power on a daily basis.  Well, Aloha Yogurt is that for me.  For months now I have been passing by the store front on my way the Big Fat Greek Express anticipating their opening, and finally it has arrived.  Monday was their first official day open, but I wanted to give them a couple of days to get acclimated before I went in being all judgmental and stuff.   Overall facts of Aloha Yogurt....locally owned and operated, open 7 days a week from 11a to 11p, make and take set up, offer 12 rotating flavor options and over 40 toppings, kid friendly, indoor and outdoor seating, and you pay by the ounce.    Although there are indeed 12 flavors to choose from, on this visit I only tested 4, and all of them were ubber yummy.  They offer the classics, the tarts, a couple low fat varieties, sorbets and customized flavors that include oatmeal cookie, cake batter, chocolate milkshake, and my absolute favorite krumb cake.  Soooo good that I am already planning the menu for my next visit!  This time I went with the oatmeal cookie, peanut butter swirl with captain crunch, mini Reeses pieces, and fudge sauce.  It was ridiculously yummy, and definitely left me wanting more.   I think next time, actually I know next time I will go for the crumb cake with cinnamon toast crunch and blueberries (hint, hint...If you are reading this Whit, just drop it off at Loveland Tuesday through Thursday between 10a and 7p, thanks).  Yum! The only bad thing about locally owned, owner operated shops is that you can't sneak in twice in one day and hope that you will have someone else working that won't recognize you.  I guess I will have to wait for another day, but I will definitely be going back again and again!

So, I just came from the grand opening, and am very impressed with the newest vintage shop in Phoenix.  Although it is a small space, owner Jessica Carroll has laid it out very well and very resourcefully might I add.  Who knew 2x4 and screws could make such aesthetically pleasing displays?    Named after Jessica's Pug, Blueberry, the storefront is red and white polka dotted and filled with absolute goodness.  It offers vintage clothing, shoes, and accessories for women, as well as accessories screen printed tees, makeup, and tassels (yes nipple tassels) done by local talent.    I scored an adorable hot pink number for Valentine's Day and leather cuff made by a local artist that completed my outfit for the evening.  Prices are very reasonable and in some instances ridiculously low to the point you feel maybe you should inform them that they may have made an error.    As for the clothing, mostly dresses, but she also offers 2 piece suits, tops and sweaters, and skirts.  All of the garments are in impeccable condition and grouped in a rainbow spectrum which speaks to my soul.    I wish Jessica the best of luck and definitely think she has something different to offer Phoenix shoppers with her eclectic mix of vintage and handmade items.

I am so excited for this place! I was just talking with Brady K. about how the Valley needs more breakfast/lunch cafes with character, and for sure Pomegranate Cafe delivers.  They have an extensive juice and smoothie menu, a plethora of unique teas, and ubber yummy breakfast, lunch and confection options.  Best of all, they use local, organic produce from the farms at South Mountain, and make all items on premises...including their almond milk!  Seriously, I love it!    Make sure to say hi to Matt when you go in.  He manages the joint, as well as bakes and makes the almond milk.  Best of all, he is great with names and conversation, so you will feel like you are old friends and you have been going there for years even though it just opened about 6 weeks ago.    For this visit, I had the white peony tea, which has a very delicate flavor and an essence of apples.  Brady K. ordered the Wild Western Tacos, and oh, my, God!  they looked awesome.  Huge portion.  Two stuffed to capacity spinach tortillas with scrambled eggs (or tofu is an option), zucchini, avocado, heirloom tomatoes, sharp cheddar.  Pomegranate Cafe offers good home cooking taken to the next level.  Imagine you had a professional kitchen with all the goodies and could just get nuts with ingredients and creativity.  It's kinda like that.  The kind of food people make because they would actually eat it, not because it's a job.  I can't say enough about this place.    Also, all drinks ordered to stay come with a yummy little cookie.  It's the little things that make a place great!  Today's cookie was an almond cookie made with maple syrup and the almond pulp left over from the latest batch of almond milk.  When I asked Matt if he had culinary training, he just said, "I like to do stuff."  Simple answer, and the awesomeness of his enthusiasm to create is apparent in everything we experienced about this place.  I can't wait to go back!
