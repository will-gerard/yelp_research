I'm not going to talk about the food because 1. There are other more egregious errors at play here and 2. It's a dimsum place in Arizona; the food is gonna be like any other dimsum place that's not in CA/NY, with the same preprepared frozen dimsum items that every other dimsum place carries.. It's as decent but it's what you'd expect.   Halfway through our meal, my dad sees a friend of his (another Chinese man) arguing with the man at the podium taking numbers for customers just arriving, as dimsum here is always extremely packed since they are one of the only places left in Tempe/Phoenix. The friend comes over to explain that he had just eaten there, and as he was leaving he saw the manager/podium guy turn away a black family. Not only did he refuse to serve them initially, when they asked why the podium guy just started physically pushing them out! When this friend asked why, the man blew it off and just said he "did not want to serve them." My dad, and the rest of our family, was outraged just as this family friend was, and so the friend went back to the podium guy to complain, saying "you can't just not serve that family for no reason!" Upon hearing that the podium guy turns to our family friend and curtly states "you can leave too" and begins to push him out of the restaurant too. The friend starts yelling "I just ate here!" Such unbelievably atrocious service and racism at what I used to think of as a half decent dimsum place in Tempe.  We quickly wrapped up our meal after witnessing this all go down, and the podium man comes over to quickly start taking our empty plates/dishes away. As he tries to stack too many plates he can handle in an attempt to clear the whole table, he ends up spilling my moms tea, nearly all over her. Then he just up and left without apologizing.  I have attached a photo of this man to my review. His face is slightly blurry but you'll know him if you see him. He is a racist, with no decency for treating his customers with any respect. I strongly suggest Phoenix Palace fire this idiot before they risk this bad press getting out and losing customers. Absolutely ridiculous.

Culinary dropout has good flavors, but the wait for both a table and the food once ordered was overwhelmingly long. The decor is inviting and modern, despite its very low lighting.   For appetizers we ordered the black mussels and burrata. The burrata was a bit stringy in texture, a little more than I would have liked, but the cider flavor really shined and complemented the green apple slices. The black mussels were nice, but the broth was the star, with an extremely rich and tasty flavor.  For entrees I ordered the korean ribeye cap, and was able to sample my family's orders. The over arching theme of the food was great flavors that were very interesting and tasty, but a little too much salt / seasoning for my liking. The korean ribeye was a good modern twist on an Asian style dish, but a bit cloyingly spicy. The bistro steak was nice, but again a little too salty. Both were a nice medium rare as ordered. The beer battered cod was nice and crispy, and the pork belly from the ramen was extremely tender.  The desserts we sampled were the monkey bread (baked fresh in house) and the black-bottom pie. Unfortunately the wait for the dessert took more like 20 minutes than the advertised 12 for the fresh monkey bread, but I'm leaning towards saying that the wait was well worth it. Both had great flavors and were not overly sweet. The graham cracker bottom of the chocolate pie was a nice touch to counter the caramel topping and fluffy chocolate filling. The vanilla ice cream nicely cut the initial sweetness of the monkey bread, marrying well with the cinnamon and warm bread pieces. Overall, the waiters were very nice and the experience in general was nice.

For what we had there -  all you can eat Korean BBQ - the food was very mediocre.   For the casual consumer of Asian cuisine in the States, this place will be sufficient in giving insight into Korean BBQ. However, if you are more familiar with the flavors and selection that ordering "Korean BBQ" provides, then you will be met with great disappointment ordering this at this establishment. We ordered at least one round of every meat available (Bulgogi, beef brisket, pork shoulder, pork belly, spicy chicken, spicy pork). The only acceptable tasting meat was the Bulgogi. Everything else was a struggle to finish, and not because we were not hungry. The pork shoulder and belly were presented cut too thick for a traditional k-BBQ presentation. The spicy marinade for the chicken and pork was very bland. The brisket was also too tough to even cut with the cheap cutlery provided. The two possibilities here are that either 1) the cook simply over cooked everything to a complete crisp (we were not allowed to cook the meat on the teppan grill ourselves) or 2) the meat was purchased from the Fry's next door and literally taken out of the freezer and thrown onto the grill without marinade (and then still over cooked). I'm leaning towards the latter. Even with the bulgogi, the marinade tasted like it was not prepared fresh; it tasted like the pre prepared marinade available for purchase at the local Asian supermarket. Oh, and frustratingly, you are slapped with a long list of rules to follow (I e two hour limit, no leftovers or you pay $15, etc) while they try to stuff you with "free salad" and a pathetic excuse for a kimchi pancake before slowly and begrudgingly bringing the meat out. Honestly for the price of $21+ per person, with the flavors and quality of the meat, this is not worth it. In fact as I write this review, I'm inclined to say even for the casual consumer this place is not worth it for korean BBQ.  Again, I write commenting only on their all you can eat BBQ, without having tried their sushi or anything else.   For good korean BBQ in Arizona, try Takamatsu.

Mellow Mushroom is a perfect place for late night food when you're lit with friends, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it for a nice formal dinner, even if you're craving pizza. We had the "constant karma" pizza, with tomato and a pesto sauce. Unfortunately, the pizza was pretty soggy after the heated cheese and pesto sauce mixed, and so it was difficult to eat the pizza, even when using a fork and knife. While I do appreciate a good pizza that stays simple to tomato + basil combination, the flavors just didn't pop for me, on top of being difficult to eat.  * the caveat is I wasn't drunk when I had this, so maybe the experience is enhanced when not completely sober. But for those of you who are straight edge, Fired Pie across the street has some better customizable and fresh pizza.

Really great Chinese food in Phoenix! Came here for dinner with my family, and it was fairly quick service, I think because most of their customers, international students, are out of town currently during summer break. It's a quiet atmosphere with really clean decor.   We ordered quite a bit of food, and I'm not sure of the English translation names of some of the dishes, but I'll post pictures and do my best to describe them.  All of the dishes have extremely generous serving sizes compared to other Chinese restaurants, the prices are average, and the flavors are clean and tasty. My favorite was definitely the mushroom stir fried with greens and pork. The dish is meant to emulate a sort of crab-like flavor, and it's really amazing.  The fish and tofu dish was nice, with silky soft tofu and large meaty filets. The two chicken dishes were great, the potato stir fry dish was thinly sliced to perfection.. I really don't have anything but good things to say besides come try this place for some authentic Szechuan cuisine!
