Before you read my review, read David B's. It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.  I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...  The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in.   The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.  Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.  So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.

Loving baseball like I do, I just had to come down for a Spring Training experience and boy am I glad I did. Frankly, I spent less time watching games than I did driving around Phoenix and the surounding area because after a few innings of watching players you have never heard of do their thing, you get a little bored and your butt gets itchy for more action. Plus, I was born in Phoenix, and hadn't been down here since I was a wee little lad and wanted to relive my youth.  It is very cool however to go from park to park just to see how different they all are and with so many teams moving from Florida to Arizona, the place is now very crowded. I saw the A's at Phoenix Muni, the Giants at Scottsdale Muni, Seattle at their new complex, Milwaukee at Marysvale and the Angels at Tempe Diablo. Of all the parks, Tempe Diablo was pretty cool, not because you have an incredibly busy freeway right off of the right field line but because of the awesome mountain right behind the left field fence. It makes the park desert-like.  The food is also very good as long as you like hot dogs and cokes. The parking really convenient as long as you get there early before the lot fills up because the park is way off by itself in an industral area and there is NO PARKING on the side streets allowed.  Finally, if you get there early and love getting player pictures and autographs, this is the place for you cause they can't escape walking from the practice fields, through the lot into the main park. No other park does this and generally the players are pretty good about stopping if you are nice to them. Personally, I have never been an autograph kind of guy. What does having someone sign their name to something do anyway? Never understood the mind-set of that. They don't care about you and frankly, do you really care about them?  All in all, if you are making the Spring Training trip, this is one of the better parks to visit. It is never that crowded so you can get a good seat and you can get yourself in and out with ease. And remember, the Angels are one of the hot teams now to so see them while they are one of the best teams.

The Phoenix Art Museum is a total treasure. You have to go there when you visit because it has so much inside, all interesting and all educational for young and old.  If you love Indian rugs and cochina dolls, the Phoenix has more original and beautiful examples than anyone else. And if you want to buy some, they are available in the Gift Shop for a BIG, BIG price. Real, authenticated Indian rugs are worth a fortune these days.  You can take tours and the tours are wonderful because the tour guides really love their stuff and are glad to share it. You can go over and over again and not be bored, it's that much fun. Plus, it's air conditioned and anyway you can get out of 120 degree heat in the summer is worth it.  Go, you'll be glad you did. Feed your head, will you.

Now that the holidays are over and it is cold outside and January starts I immediately look forward to Spring with the green hills, wildflowers and longer days. Only 2 months to March and baseball to fill the days with the calming voices of announcers describing the action.   Away and above all others, this is my favorite Spring Training baseball park. It is right in the smack-dab middle of Scottsdale, so there are plenty of restaurants and social clubs within walking distance and that is a big plus. All of the other parks are all by themselves and you have nothing nearby to see or do without getting in your car and driving around. BOO to that.   It is also next to a great library so you can park in the library lot, walk in to the library, check your emails and email any important ones back before the game, then walk to the park knowing everything is taken care of and well in hand so that you can sit, relax and enjoy the action carefree.   It is also a real old-style type park with grass all around the outfield so you can sit on a blanket and kinda see what is going on. Not really though. Great to take the little babies and let them crawl on the turf if you have em.   Getting a good seat is really hard, even for me, a Giants season ticket holder, because all the locals flock here and snap up all the good ones so you will probably have to deal with those dreaded scalpers. And they ain't cheap. It's ALWAYS crowded.   Anyway, I have been to most of the Phoenix area parks and I really like this one, the Angels park in Tempe and the A's park in Phoenix/Papago are great too. All have their little cool quirks and flavor so if you love baseball, you have to come down here at least once and experience the uniqueness of Spring Training. I've done it twice and if I could get away from work, I would do it again. No long vacations for me anymore since I've been really busy with the court systems.   So if you love baseball and the desert and warm weather and nice restaurants and getting away for awhile then this is a great way to go.  Plus i just found out that yelp has a spell checker for those typos. Cool beans.

Steaks and baseball. Baseball and steaks. That is what Don and Charlie's is known for. We were down in Arizona for Spring Training and had gone looking for great baseball eating places to go to after the games. We first went to Pink Pony and were disappointed. Then someone told us that D and C's was the new hotspot so we went there and was it ever great.  It was packed inside and the walls were filled with amazing baseball items and photos. Luckily, we were seated in the VIP corner booth right in the center of all the action. Then the Mom of the owner came up and started speaking to us, she was so nice and friendly, and eventually she sat down with us and spent much of the time of our meal with us in spite of all of the hubbub going on around us.  We got steaks and they were big and delicious. The potatoes were huge, the horseradish fresh and spicy hot. The entire night was terrific and the next time we return to Phoenix, we will probably go to D and C's every night because we know the food will be excellent and the service perfect.

After writing about the Heard Museum, I remembered that I had taken some photos from my Spring Training/Sightseeing /Childhood Memory Trip back to my birthplace, Phoenix. Sure enough, I had baseball pictures of Barry Bonds and Giants Stadium, downtown Scottsdale pictures, clever pictures of me in stupid cowboy hats and some of Taliesin West. (SEE PICTURES)  If you don't know about Taliesin West, you aren't alone unless you are a lover of Frank Lloyd Wright, which I have been from an early age because my Mom and Dad both went to school and graduated from Arizona State, I went to college there too at the age of 4, and Mr. Wright built the auditorium called affectionately, "the Birthday Cake" so his name was probably one of the first ones I was ever taught.   In my opinion, F.L. Wright is surely America's greatest architect, if not the world's greatest. I have a fantastic 2 hour PBS special on him that explores his life and work in great depth, it's wonderful to pull out  from time to time and get re-inspired.  Taliesin was his dream home, his school and his refuge. Originally built on the side of a gently sloping mountain well outside of the quickly-growing suburbs in the heart of the Sonoran desert, Taliesin was organic, living, melded to its stone, sand and gravel surroundings due to the fact that its materials were plucked from those very locations. Its unique roofing structure could only be dreamed and conceived from the heart of genius as the lack of rainfall allowed it to be redwood and canvas, like the teepee's of the native Indian cultures.  Having been there before as a child, I really could not appreciate it to any great extent then but as an adult, I was truly amazed at its massive expanse and by the fact that it was built stone by stone by hand with the loving work of his adoring students. Their spirits and care are reflected in every pore of the breathing, flexing structures joined together in strange, illogical ways. Windy paths, odd angles, smoothed beams, brightly colored carpets and art, contrasting paints, dripping fountains, flapping textures, long-shallow reflecting pools, open-aired rooms, vaulting stairs, low-slung passageways... all conceived by the brilliant, unconventional mind of the master to ponder and entice thought by confusion of the stated norm being smashed into oblivion. Purists laugh but those with an unjaundiced eye coupled with a heart of appreciation for the existence of a new form of human living quarters that you have to force yourself to integrate your soul in order to fully exist with it. Taliesin must become a part of its occupants and visitors, like a natural extension of existence, in order to impart its magic as creativity abounds with every sense affected at each new revelation.  Lucky students pursuing careers in wood and metal work, painting, sculpture, photography and pottery are allowed to stay on the preserved desert ecosystem in small, clever, experimental structures or shelters that pop up throughout the 600 acre grounds. I got to see many of these during my visit and they were truly interesting to see. Weird while being functional, they all interested me greatly but sadly I was not allowed to get too close or to interact with any of them.  Finally, there are 2 large theatres that I saw on the tour for concerts and performances. Creativity is encouraged to flow from the spirit, soul and body; a complete immersion without judgment or criticism. Freedom for the individual and for the group-think to attempt to inspire and unconform the conformed.   It was my dream to see this wonderland again... I came, I saw, I was changed. My heart pumped stronger, then I cried a little in leaving due to my great fortune. However Taliesin is in my mind, my soul, my eyes and her smell is everpresent whenever I think of her.  So long Frank Lloyd Wright, you put your spell on me ...  http://www.youtube.com...

I was born in Scottsdale and remember Camelback from my childhood, it is kind of my personal mountain as I climbed around it as a wee little man, picking up rocks and getting stuck by cactus, looking for snakes and lizards.  We returned awhile ago to go to Spring Training and it all came back to me again. In a different place than I remember but the shape was the same. Plus, now people are all walking all over it like ants in an anthill. It is quite amazing to see really old people going up the steep mountain like goats in the hot, hot heat. Hope I can do that when I get there.  Anyway, Camelback is a central destination for Phoenixites, for fun and exercise. Just remember to always take hats, sunscreens and water when you go. It's dangerous without it. And the mountain is MUCH steeper than you think.

Papago Park, the home of the Spring Training Oakland A's, is a wonderful place to go in Phoenix. It is truly a park within the city and you feel like you can get away from it all for a day or so. One thing Phoenix doesn't have much of is good parks. You can get up early in the morning, before the heat takes over, and walk the hills and mountains. The rocks are just beautiful, maybe the most beautiful in all of the area.  If you get up early, you can watch the sunrise and if you go late, you can watch the sunset (only in the winter, it's too hot in the summer to take the hill). In winter, I love this place because of all of the blooming cactus and wildflowers and smells of the dirt and rocks. Nothing like the desert smell, you never forget it. I grew up here and found many gemstone rocks, crawdads in the water drains, ate tons of grapefruit, even a lizard or three found my net. Plus i learned to ride a bike in our sand driveway, I can still remember my dad running along side me, then letting me go. isn't that how life is, a series of training then letting go?   So come to Papago, it's really interesting, fun and a break from the buildings and streets of the city. It's also near the Zoo and Botanical Gardens for added fun and experiences.

Wow, I am shocked by the negative reviews of the Biltmore. It was and to me is THE hotel of Phoenix. If you want more information about it, just click on the weblink and read all about it. The history of the Biltmore is amazing. Sure it's old but that only adds to its charm.   The Jewel of the Desert ...  http://www.arizonabiltmore.com/?WT/srch=1  You could never had a hotel like this built today because of all the land it's on. The grounds for parking alone are huge, bigger than most hotels are. Quite amazing.  Just park your car and walk around inside and around the grounds. It's magnificent. We stayed recently on the other side of town for baseball games, none near here but if I was coming to Phoenix for sightseeing, my first choice to stay would be the Biltmore.

The queen of Phoenix baseball eateries is closed. A sad, sad, sad day. The stories that were told in the place could fill the Hall Of Fame. In the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's it was out the door crowded. It was THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN.  Alas, the economy and competition have done their best to shutter history. So long sweet baby, I'll miss your special charms and Scottsdale is a lesser place for your demise.
