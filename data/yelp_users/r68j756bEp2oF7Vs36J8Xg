When a place has as many reviews as Chicago Hamburger Co and it rates 4 stars, sometimes I wonder why bother with a review.  Well, 1) it's good to have several current reviews and 2) i try and provide a little different view.  I bring my 5 1/2 yr old daughter here about twice a month.  She likes to call it "Chicag - eee's" (Like weenies).  This is one of those places where a little dirt is not only acceptable but seems to add to the flavor.  I'm not talking about health code issues, just the dirt that comes from a well-worn well-known place.  The staff and cooks toil hard yet are always quick and friendly.  The food is great.  It's not backyard bbq good - - - it's hole-in-the-wall kinda good.  The shakes are great.  The prices are even better.  My daughter always wins a stuffed animal from the "Claw Arcade Game" - - - although it's probably cause I give her 20 quarters.  She and I both love the sliders.  They have a good flatscreen that always has a game on.  The only thing that would make me want to stay longer or go more frequently would be to put Galaga instead of Pac-Man.  Also, I love the red wiener dog hanging from the ceiling but it needs a little repair.  Regardless, friendly staff, good eats, and cheap food ... this place is worth a stop.

From June to September, this is a great place to escape the heat.  You ideally need to bring a sweater and perhaps some gloves to keep you comfortable. When looking for this place, remember it's towards the back of the shopping plaza and is a few retailers East of the Wal-Mart.  + + +'s = escaping the heat, friendly workers, nice rink, can hold parties. - - - 's = beaten up rental shoes (similar to other rinks and bowling alleys, maybe they sell them like that), not much to do beyond skating (i.e. old video arcade games) For a skate and an escape from the heat, this is a good place.

Had lunch here early afternoon.  From the outside you are fooled a bit as this establishment is housed in the "Old Town Pueblo" looking building next to a tattoo place and Schlotzsky's.  You are fooled into thinking this might be a half-ass run pita joint.  However, the only fooling once you step inside is the faux old world walls and fixtures; so Vegas-ish.  I did notice a windex smell upon entering.  I took that as a good thing vs. a bad thing although it was a little nasty to waff.  Otherwise this place is pretty authentic Lebanese.  I had the hummus appetizer along with the chicken kabob sandwich, both were yummy.  I always get a little shy trying foreign food in the desert cause it always seems like the stuff is a day or two old, but the stuff looked fresh and tasted yummy.  The place was playing some Arabic music and had some Bollywood looking movie on the two plasma screens and although our waitress was from Venezuela, she played and sounded the Lebanese part pretty good.  She apologized for taking too long to bring out our bill, but I was having such a good convo with my friend that I told her 'no worries'.  I noticed that they do offer hookah and belly dancing on the weekends.  They have a little VIP nook inside and an average size patio outside.  You can sit down if you walk in the back door or order take-out from the front door.  + + +'s: fairly ethnic feel, fresh lunch food, clean, several areas to eat (inside, outside, VIP, take-out), friendly service  - - - 's: faux materials (we all know it's fake, just paint it mediterranean blue or something), tone down on the clean smell  In sum, if you are looking for a bit of ethnic flair with decent food and a variety of seating choices, this is your place.  If you are looking for upscale mediterranean, look elsewhere.

I just wrote a decent review but then the post errored out.  annoying! Food - Awesome.  Service - Excellent.  Atmosphere - A bit loud.  My only issue was that our table seemed more at home in an Ikea in-store cafe than this one-of-a-kind restaurant.  All-in-all 4 stars.

I literally live 1/4 of a mile from this eatery.  I would never have tried it except for reading a Yelp review that called out what I will echo: you would never guess something this authentically good exists in a nondescript setback shopping strip.  I was starving and needed cheap eats.  I showed up at 5p on a Saturday.  I was welcomed by the "OPEN - ABIERTO" sign, made me start feeling the authentic ethic vibe.  When I entered I immediately noticed the strong cleaning smell.  A smell that I have smelled other times in mexican joints actually in Mexico so I took that as a good authentic smell vs. a bad one.  Not sure if you can order Mexican "TVs" but they have two of them with poor reception playing futbol; making this place authentic.  Add a large floor fan going, plus a tall gray waste basket near the serving counter, plus a host of beers and wine, plus them trying to make it look like the typical half-ass built mexican cantinas by spray painting faux cracks in the wall, plus the friendly spanish speaking food staff, plus the que bueno carne asada burro with caliente salsa, and El Molino Mexican Cafe sums to a very decent place to grab some inexpensive Mexican food.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars just yet - - - would have been nice to see some other sit-down patrons to make it a fiesta and I had to wait a little too long for my burro.  But heck, that's authentic mexican!

+ + +'s: fun/authentic atmosphere/decor, outdoor patio, cheap food, free chips & salsa at beginning, free sopaipillas at end  - - - 's: chips & salsa ok, as well as the food (however, this food is pretty authentic)  If you are in downtown Scottsdale and want a fun, cheap, authentic Mexican place I'd chose Frank & Lupe's over Los Olivos, El Molino's, or Julio's.

ok, i arrived at 11:15p on a Saturday night and the line was about 20 deep, mostly with dudes with the obligatory seven year old fad of untucked dress shirt, 3 front buttons open, and cuffs flared with some kind of TJMaxx jeans and pleather shoes.  But there was some ass in line that made me wish I could bag a 21 year old.  Since my posse was inside, I played the older dude knowing even older people inside da club and thus got waved by all the young twats & rots yearning to go into the PCL as if it was fockin' OZ.  Mind you, I was with a hot piece who was my friend so my review is not jaded by the "ah fuck it's 2:05a and I'm going home to beat my drunken ass off by myself AGAIN".  +++'s: nice ass for us guys; big pecs for you ladies; stiff drinks from the bartenders who were mildly attentive; latest hip-pop mixes  - - -'s: all those rice bag carrying meat heads that stand in the VIP area thinking that if they have an Ed Hardy tee and a fedora on and occasionally raising their non-needed in this Darwinian age big biceped arms in the air, that they will get some candy to come up and grind on their nub.  fortunately, and not surprisingly, a fight broke out and about a half dozen meatloafs ended up getting kicked out, but of course, spoiled the night for some of their bitches that yelled "stop, Tony, stop".  SERIOUSLY, unless you are in construction or pro sports, there is NO need to be that buff, aggressive, and quite frankly a space waster. - - - no dedicated dance floor, cramped and cornered "VIP" area, ho-hum atmosphere, same picture of hot chick flipping us the finger above the bar that has been there forever, and music way, way, way too loud  In sum, if you want a true Scottsdale club experience, like cock jocks, or 23 yr old hotties acting like 3 yr olds by dancing on the tables, this is your place.  This is basically where the $15,000 millionaires go vs. the $30,000 mil's at Six.  Or if you don't want to go to the other STD strewn clubs of Axis, Myst, et al...this might only get you genital warts.  (by the way, this was my third time here in as many years).

For starters, this is a SPORTS bar.  If you want just a BAR, go elsewhere.  Also, this is mainly an "Eagles" football place.  If you want a team agnostic place, go elsewhere.  I experienced this on a Sunday that the Eagles were to play on Monday night.  If my experience is the same as when the Eagles play on Sundays, then I would give it five stars.  Four stars for now, summed up as:  Show up 30 minutes before the game, get a great pick of seats.  Note to all us game watchers: don't expect to get the best seats if you show up 1 minute before kick-off.  You know that, so why do you keep doing that?  Your team is guaranteed to be on their TV's given they have over two dozen screens.  Mind you, the 3 big screens will almost certainly have the Eagles, the Bears, or the Lions on the screen.  However, showing up early as I did, the 'tv dj' let me select the TV I wanted.  NICE.  The reason I capitalized SPORTS above is because you can not expect great food at a SPORTS bar, it should be ok to good and cheap.  Upper Deck scores on this one.  You don't go to a stadium and walk away saying damn they have great hot dogs and the draft brew is wonderful.  You go to SPORTS bars to WATCH THE GAME.  Upper Deck ensures you can.  +++'s: FREE fast WiFi (so you can check the scores and your girl that's with you who gets bored after the 1st Qtr can social network); OK cheap sports bar food (breakfast burritos & other stuff before 11a and under $9); plenty of TV's; plenty of seating if you get there early; friendly, although not speedy, wait staff who put Hooters girls to shame; good relatively clean crowd although a little more than a healthy dose of the mid-western/north-eastern boys who think their team is THEIR team and those mid-west girls with the witch-chin, beady eyes, thin plucked brows, stark nose, and brown straight bob that wear banana republic clothes (they're still hot and I'd take one on the chin for 'em).  - - - 's: bloody mary i ordered was a bit too peppery, not sure what the bathrooms looked like  In sum, a good sports bar for guys & girls that want a place in Old Town that is down-to-earth and will have your game on (just don't expect to hear it over the regional fan din).  GO BILLS!

After spending way too much on my hair cuts over the past few years at salons, I decided to go for the first time into a barber shop with the candy-twirling cylindrical thingy out front.  I had visions of old men getting their ear hair trimmed and getting their sides slicked down with Brylcreem. Well, this family-run place has its fair share of old men, but all the barbers have been cutting hair for a good number of years.  This place has weathered the Old Town recession because of good prices, friendly barbers, and decent cuts.  Although they are slowly changing the interior to be more sports-ish (they already have a few TVs on ESPN all the time), they still have the requisite late 80's male hair portraits (which give an uncomfortable gay-man is watching me vibe).  A few of the barbers give excellent shaves.  While two women of the family work there, they are also good at what they do.  My only wish for this place is that they get a few more bigger flat screens and take down those hair portraits because I have yet to witness a dude walking in and point up at the wavy hair of the guy in a popped up collar pink shirt and say "that's how I want my hair". ***Cash Only***

Ok, don't nut punch me 'cause I'm writing a review on Da Bux.  I'm not here to review the mediocre drip, the yeast infected pastries, nor the annoying indie music.  I'm here to say that this Starbucks has more eye candy for the 30 something crowd than a 75% off sale at Banana Republic.  It starts with being one of the largest Bux in all of Phoenix.  It is 3X bigger than any of the other green brown stations in the area.  This lends itself to bunches of coffee cake crusted comfy cushions and chairs that spill out into an L-shaped patio with a Parisian bistro flair.  Now for you ladies (hey, hey, ladies!), the pecs around here usually sport specs since they are in their 30's to 50's, but they got cash (or they are at least nicely dressed perverts).  NOW, for us guys, the breasts around here are more fake then the goods lining Shanghai's flea markets.  But heck, as long as those nipples aren't plastic, I'll bite.  +++'s: THE best Starbucks for older eye-candy (30+), free Wi-fi with your starbucks card, ample seating, always a good clean crowd, in Kierland commons  - - -'s: it's another Starbucks  In sum, if you want to enjoy a cup of Joe (or Jane) in style, this is the Starbucks to do it at.

Arcadia needed this coffee house!  Hava Java married Coffee Bean!  First, let me admit that I drink a lot of coffee, specifically flavored lattes.  Daily, sometimes more than once a day, I will visit Starbucks, LGO, Hava Java, or Carmel's.  Black Cat is similar to Hava Java: large patio doors that open up during cooler weather, inviting interior with artwork, music playing, and cute baristas.  Black Cat has more seating than the closest Starbucks at 44th and Hava Java.  It's way quieter than LGO or Starbucks.  It has able wall outlets vs Hava Java.  It has two leather chairs!  Which, if they put 2 or 3 more sets (or leather love seats) where some of the bistro tables are, would make me rate this SIX STARS.  I give it four stars because it recently opened and this business could go to 5 or 3 over the next 6 to 9 months.  If they pull this Hava Java meets Coffee Bean off, it will compete with the best of them.  Yay!  I'm a fan.

Ate lunch here during the week.  Great food for the price.  Cool atmosphere.  Makes me think twice about driving 3 more miles to Old Town. I'm not a beer drinker, but I welcome establishments like these to add to the Arcadia mix of wine bars.

Disappointed. Server forgot to ask for drinks. Chicken was ok, vegetables were overly foraged and limp. Didn't have wine but they did have extensive list. Nice bar area. Improvement to service and tastier dishes would make this a star better.

Whether I've been there for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the atmosphere is always energetically sophisticated. Service is friendly and fast. (Although getting lattes takes a bit longer than other places). Food tastes fresh and moderately priced.

I lived in Texas for 10 years, so I know good BBQ.  Staff super friendly, reasonable prices, and for Arcadia area, very convenient.

When I want sit-down BBQ that is served fast, needs paper towels, has plenty of sauces, and in a Cowboy-esque atmosphere, I go to Frasher's. Being within the Arcadia area is a big plus. I like the flat screens playing sports, free self-serve soft drink refills, and super friendly staff.
