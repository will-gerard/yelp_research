I have been a member for several years and have utilized Core Concepts training.  Core Concepts is great, they have some good trainers at this location so they get 5 stars. What sucks is the gym and the management team continue to ignore complaints about shoddy equipment.  So for grins after my work out on 8/16 I checked out all the ellipticals, treadmills, stationary bikes, stair climbers etc..Over 50% were in disrepair, ok whats does that mean? Heart rate monitors not working, torn up grips, broken handles, adjustments that didn not work, busted tv's video/audio. For what members are paying, did I mention they sent a letter 8/17 raising fees?, one should get much more for the $$. They just don't seem to care......think twice before signing up or resigning.....

Two stars is generous, food was horribly wrong, beef was whipped hard , more like jerky, pork was barely passible.  Potatoes were great.  Bartenders were very good.  Fire your chef because he or really sucks

I purchased a lance 2295, new.  I spent 3+ hours doing a predelivery insp.  Only one big issue which is a Lance design issue, in my opinion.  Allen and Andy did a good job addressing the fixes.  They are good folks and thus far I have had few issues.  The lance product is B very well made, and they had a great selection of other products.  I'll buy again from the boys

Our last visit in June was very disappointing, but since I have been following Mario for nearly 23 years I passed it off as everybody has bad nights.  Went back after 4 months, had the pizza, was average, dough was soggy but had good flavor.  What really blew me was the wine list, pretty good, but whoa! serious price increases!  I love wine with good Italian food but they have gone into the stratosphere on pricing.  I guess all good things do come to an end, time to find another place, shouldn't be hard, lots of competition out there.

Dr J is an excellent physician, always makes sure all questions are answered, you get  real appt. No bullshit. They are very efficient and accessible, prior to Obama care.  Have not been in since that stupid law kicked in.  Really knows his stuff very easy to talk to and he communicates very well.

Been going to DU for some time, I heard they have new owners in the last month so I hope this will improve all apsects of this business.  Food is average, pricey for what it is, smoked ribs, brisket and pulled pork are great but another company.   Wine selection is getting slim, don't know whats up with that, but there are other wines bars that have much better selections. Service can be very slow so you cannot be in a rush.  They have some good entertainment at times.

Tried the new years eve event, dinner with wine pairings.  Food was Ok, never saw the wine pairings so we bought our own which was good, decent selections.  They have a good staff but they can't manage big events very well, not enough staff.  Suggestion would be to hire etra folks for the really large events, service anf getting what you pay for is everything in this business.  Very limited bar so  would not classify as a full bar.  Sundays are a great day to go not real busy so food and service are good

Tried this place a few times, ok wine list-pricey. NOISY!! You cannot carry a normal conversation, asked the owner to turn music down but he just ignores you, probably because he is usually have lit.  Food st ok but expensive for what it is.  If you go, Sunday seems to be the only day they won't try to blow your ear drums out.  Nope I am not an old guy, I just like to talk to folks in a normal tone vs. screaming

We live around the corner, we have tried this place now over a dozen times and it just gets worse.  Food? OVERPRICED! We have tried several items, pizza(is that what is was?) burger (pressed cardboard) between soggy buns.  Service if you can get it is awful.  Stopped in several sundays ago, not 10 people in the place moslty staff behind the bar, sat there for 15 minutes while they nlooked at me, had ot ask for service, order a marg and sandwich, 20 minutes later still have neither bar tender went back and started talking to her co-workers rather than do her job, I left!.  Managment there needs to wake up or be discharged, evident they are clueless

We celebrated my wifes 50th birthday, had about 50 guests.  Dean and his team served up great apps, very good wine.  Wer had a simple menu, 9oz filet, 10oz lamb chop, atlantic cod and chicken.  I like my filet cooked "blue" very few place know how to do this well, melted in my mouth.  The food came out on time, no one gota a cold meal and no one had a complaint, given that hardly a scrape was left I would say this place really knows there stuff.  Excellent food, outstanding service, beats the hell out of Flemmings or Ruth's Chris and is a far better deal.  Going back for sure!

Well we have been several times and I must say they are very good, food is great!, Service is excellent and the menu is elegant.  Last visit I jad my usual filet mignon cooke "blue' and a lobster tail, man that was good eating!  Good job DC keep it rockin!  Would like to see a broader wine list, what they have is good but adding a bit more variety would kick things up a notch

we have been going here for over a year, Dean and team do a great job, best steaks in town, good service fun staff and they know their business.  Broader wine selection would be good but the reserve wone list is a good step in that direction.

We live in walking distance, have been there several times for Bfast, Lunch and dinner.  First, good wine list, bit overpriced but not like "The Living Room" (noisey cougar trasp).  Bfast has been OK, burned Blueberry pancakes, bur verything else is OK if they get all the ingrediants in the dish, check before you bite.  Lunch can be good, organic chicken salad is great.  Dinner has been hit or miss every time, orders don't come out on time or it is not what we ordered, might be a wait staff issue.  Service can be very slow so be patient.  Food and drink quality is not yet consistent.  I really want them to make it as it is so close to the house.  I think the corner resturants and bars are the wave of the future, you can have good food, wine or drinks and not worry about driving.

we live .7 miles from BLD, bike or walking distance.  Good atomsphere, bar tenders decent.  Food is OK but lacks consistancy, we have eaten there now over a dozen times, this week twice.  They get order right about 50% of the time.  Typical blunders are not all ingrediants are in the meal, food brought out cold or burnt!.  I hope they get it right, looks Like Tia Rosa's next door folded up after only 2.5 months, so less competition.  Come on BLD you can do better!

Ate there Dec 29th.  Had Idaho Trout, Salmon, Rack of ribs, tendorloin and artichokes.  Both fish were uneventful, pretty bland...expensive, I have had much better for the price.  Ribs, little meat and tasted like they boiled them before they were grilled, no flavor other than some pretty lame BBQ sauce.  Tendorloin was undercooked and tough, again little flavor.  Artichokes were pretty good, cut in half and grilled seasoned very nicely.  In summary, expensive, wine list is nothing to get very excited about and like everything else expensive for what you get.  Thought we were supposed to get bread and didn't, service was OK, albeit slow at times.  Think I will wait for sometime before going back, maybe it will get better, if not they won't be around very long.

Ok, slow to learn!  Food is Bonanza grade, at Flemmings prices.  If you can get to the bar seat due to all the drunk Chop investors and their posse, you might get a drink, just a bunch of assholes drinking for free and they treat the real customers like shit.  If you really want a good steak, chops or fish I really suggest you go to DC Steakhouse in down town chandler.  Very good prices and excellent food.  I would stay away from Chop, looks nice but that is as far as it goes

recent trip to HOB with 6 others on a Saturday afternoon. There were 7 servers, 1 bartender and one guy I must assume was the GM.  there were 8 others in the place.  It took 15 minutes to a beer order, they were all too busy yakking it up with each other.  This went on for a few beers until we finally called out the waitress! asked her if she planned on making  a tip she better get off her tattooed ass and start waiting on us.  We ordered food and then had to send it all back!, soggy nasty stuff.  The owner better get his/her act together, I give them 6 months before they shutter that location AGAIN!!

Ordered BLT brunch, came out cold, soggy fries. 2 strip of bacon?? Why do the call it a BLT?  Really did suck, last time I try eating here.  I will say owner took the food off our tab, so that was good and the right thing to do

Been twice, great vibe great layout, price point is good, one review that I read was way off the mark, think the writer  was drunk didn't get much right.  Staff is very professional, excellent service and fun folks.  I have not tried the food yet but it did look delicious.  The hand crafted drinks are the best I have ever had and I have had alot.  This is a neat place, my new go to spot.  Great job Gavin!!
