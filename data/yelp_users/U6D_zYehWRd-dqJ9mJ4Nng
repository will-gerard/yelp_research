Had a special occasion dinner here and was fully disappointed.  I worked in the food industry for over 10 years and this place is terrible.    The only good thing was the water at best!  To top it all off 4 out of 6 of us got sick after eating the food.  It is way over priced for such amateur service and boring food.  Should of just gone next door to Zipps!

This place rocks!  If you are looking for a great burger this is the spot!  They have a great menu which have specialty and unique burgers or a build it yourself burger menu that is really good.  I work in the area and have already gone there twice in the same week.  This place is my new favorite!
