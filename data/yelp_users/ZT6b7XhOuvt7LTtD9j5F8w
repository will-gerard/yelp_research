I have been 'seeing' Jon for many, many years. His cuts are amazing and I love his color and highlights. He does a great job every time. I travel a great distance and over the years have tried to find another stylist but always end up back with Jon. He is really that good!!! Give him a call at 480-510-6500. You'll be so glad you did! :)

My husband, who is half Japanese, and I love Japanese cuisine. We have eaten at AhSo on several occasions for a number of reasons, none of which include quality food or service.  The location is convenient and the Tepenyaki offers a fun experience as well as an alternative to sushi for those who don't eat raw fish.  Unfortunately our last visit was more of the same - terrible service & mediocre food at best.  Tokyo Lobby or Fresh Wasabi (which we just discovered now serves Tepenyaki) are much better alternatives for sushi on the west side.

Stopped in for lunch today and thought they'd be packed from the looks of the parking lot.  Once inside they didn't appear to be that busy.  We were seated right away.  Chips and salsa came first and I was certainly in need of a beverage by the time they came to take the drink order.  Service from this point was very slow.  Took a good 45 minutes to get our food.  By the time we were ready for the check we really needed to hurry so I asked for it which fell on deaf ears.  I finally walked over to our server and stated we were pressed for time could we get our check and she said she was working on it.  We were extremely patient with the slow service but at this point the elderly woman waiting on us really could have cared less that we needed to hustle up.  Food was ok.  My husband asked specifically if the machaca beef was made with egg and was told it was.  Well it wasn't, basically just shredded beef.  Have lived in Phoenix for 30+ years and only been here once or twice (probably 25+ years ago).   Will certainly not go out of my way to return.

We've been here several times and usually enjoy the casual, family friendly atmosphere.  Tonight we had a bad experience so not sure we'll be back, at least not anytime soon.  They weren't too busy when we arrived, seemed a normal weeknight crowd.  When our food took forever we overheard our server tell the table next to us (when they inquired 'where's our food?') they were understaffed in the kitchen.  Our food was served almost an HOUR after we arrived with no explanation or apology.  The kids fries were barely warm, mac & cheese was like soup, hubby's fish tacos were ok and my spinach salad was ok as well.  I would expect the manager to be offering an apology, maybe even a complimentary bread appetizer to hold us over (especially the kids!), or at the very least the server should have offered an apology.

I'm a big fan of this sushi spot.  Another 'west side' gem (and there's not too many, unfortunately).  Sushi is outstanding and the menu offers many options.  I'm a rice snob and the rice is excellent...that's not always the case at other sushi restaurants.

A gem on the west side.  I LOVE this place!  Great vibe and good ambiance.  Oh...and the food is fantastic!  Be careful though...it's got some heat.

Really enjoyed the food at this little hole in the wall, mom-n-pop joint.  Fresh ingredients and great flavor.  Will definitely be back, best option is take out!

I'm fairly new to WBC but have become a raving fan. This is a new location and it's beautiful. The menu is filled with healthy options. Everything I've had on multiple occasions is fresh with quality ingredients. The service is outstanding and the place is always immaculate including the bathrooms.

We arrived around 7:15 and they were not busy. Happy Hour starts at 7:30 so they got busy and only one server did not cut it. She was nice but couldn't keep up with 7 tables, then 8. The sushi chefs (2) couldn't keep up either. Waited almost 45 minutes for our roll. The tuna sushi was not good as it had some kind of gristle in it and I couldn't eat either piece. The chicken katsu was horrible as well, super thin, cold, just didn't taste freshly prepared. Avocado salad would have been really good if it wasn't downed in salad dressing. This is not our first time here but it very well may be our last. Too bad since Japanese is usually my first choice and there's nothing else nearby.
