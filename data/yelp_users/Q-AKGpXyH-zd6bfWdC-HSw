This place is Authentic, if your looking for tex mex this isn't it.  You can feel and tell the place is authentic if the majority of the customers are from the country the restaurant claims to serve food from!  Everything is fresh and the food is prepared by a couple of "Real Senoras" in the back; that posses the real Sazon of Real Mexican Food!.  Highly recommend the sopes and Enchiladas in Salsa Roja sauce!!!  Also the Menudo is Excellent, tacos are awesome, try the Tripitas mmm!  You wont get this Authentic experience in any Filibertos, taco bell, or any of the other pretenders!! Enjoy!!

Best Enchiladas I tried in Phoenix, better than gadzooks that according to yelp, they are ranked number 1! Going back to Dick's, the sauce is authentic New Mexican flavor, but what made it for me was that they use Blue Corn tortillas!  That's going above and beyond!  Service is awesome, the cooks are awesome, nice Mexican gentleman and a white guy that seem to make a great duo! Love the mimosas nice and strong!  Great Bar, great place for our community!  Need more bars, restaurants like these!  Bring on the Happiness!

I just wish Mexican Cuisine, which is my native Cuisine would be more refine.  By that I mean, use better oils, less oil and lighter ingredients.  The flavor of the food is there, but its just too heavy, the salsa both of the that were provided (green and red) were both way to hot to enjoy.  I like hot, I am from Mexico city, but you have to have a really hot option and a normal hot option.  I will start rewarding Mexican Restaurants that transform the recipes  but keep the awesome flavor of Real Mexican Food!

You are already eating enough carbs, why would you put sugar on top of the burger.  The concept I appreciate, but the portions oz of the Burger patty I do not.  I weight around 183lbs and after finishing a Burger with fries and a drink still felt hungry, and I mean a lot.  I think the chef should focus more in bringing natural big flavor to his burgers instead of plain sugar.  Like poblano peppers, chipotle, caramelized onions, jalapenos, Blue Cheese and not just rely on the show Tripple D for its reputation.

Waited 2 hours to get to average north Sonoran Mexican tacos!  Not worth the wait, not worth the taste....

Worst service, the waitresses run around with their heads cut off, and the restaurant was not half full. We got our food in stages, not all together as it should be. We were celebrating mom's B-day, and because of the service and less than average food, it was a disappointment! Do yourself a favor avoid this place! Minus 5 stars!

Went today to this establishment and what a deception, what a let down.  Dont get me wrong the $5 for 2 slices and drink special is not bad, but the employees working there seem to be just anybody from the street.  The soonest I sat down to have the meal, they started talking really loud along with a visitor using profanity after profanity.  They didn't care there were paying customers inside trying to enjoy their meal.  They seem oblivious of having a good customer impression.  The cook kept using profanity along with the waitresses/cashiers there.  Left there is a bad taste of mouth and spirit.  I really wanted to like the place because it seem like good addition to the neighborhood ; but was sadly disappointing, what a shame..!  Hopefully the owner would read this, so he or she can correct such simple problem

The only good thing about the food, was the taste of the meat.  You can tell the logistics are off, they don't have a great system or and also the presentation and proportions of the food.  I recently had jaw surgery so was looking forward to one of my first meals, and wanted to check this place out.  The girl up front took my order wrong, I said I wanted 1 Medium Carne asada Burrito (really small), 2 cabeza tacos and 1 pastor.  When I opened the food up there was 1 Burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  So no cabeza and no pastor which I really wanted to try both of them; so was really disappointed because it wanted it to be a special meal.  I can really honestly say that I can make better tacos at home with better presentation and of course the meats I like.  Hopefully they can work the kinks and make themselves better!

I been there 2 times, the first time it was late but the young guy working the counter was awesome, as I walked in he received me with a welcome, gave me the whole donut tour.  When I was walking out, he told me to come back any time; he just seemed legit!  Second time was through the drive thru, they did not have a particular kind of donut I wanted, so I think the same guy just gave me 3 or 4 extra donuts from the other ones for the inconvenience!  The Donuts are tasty, specially the donut holes and the chocolate covered.  Customer Service was awesome both times and the Donuts were Excelente!!!

Never tried the Down town location, because didn't want to do the long wait times!  So after knowing this restaurant just by fame and recognition, went and tried it out.  Showed up and there he was; Big Matt with a big smile in his face; at the door being the hostess of his restaurant.  When do you see than any where else or any other owner with half of his reputation even attempting it.  Just by seeing that site and his humble positive energy I was really ready in trying the service and the food.  I never had an American Breakfast like this before.  Crispy waffles on the outside and gooey and soft in the inside.  Freshly squeezed orange juice and bottomless awesome coffee.  The pork chop was a little dry, but that was about it, everything else was awesome!  Matt does so many things right, stevia on the table, perfect selection of coffee cups made in the USA!, the fresh cut flowers on the table, but the very especial thing, was the staff!!  I think everyone of his staff including the two managers came to check up on us, and ask if they could get something for us!  Spectacular service, restaurants in the Valley should learn from Matt's philosophy!  Everything is honest, fresh, authentic, simple, taught off and  delicate.  Keep growing guys, keep getting better, maybe a Dinner menu with late hours could be a possibility!!  I can Dream right, and Dreams are meant to be lived!  Blessings
