I live at the bar! Thursday night is very busy and it brings in a crowd that is not normally there on any other night of the week. But it's still a lot of fun and they have very good drink specials. Just recently they have started punk rock night on Sundays starting at 10:00 pm. Shane Terrell, owner of Imperial Tattoo DJ's until closing.   Also since football has started, the bar has started serving breakfast in the mornings for all the football fans.   The food is good, the people are fun and it's just an all around great local bar!

Loved it! Make sure you come hungry. The food is wonderful with tons of flavor. The interior is very unique and fun and the staff is very attentive. You can't really ask for much more.

I went to the Phix last Tuesday to see Fucked Up. I never got around to looking at the art work. Sorry. Sunny B is correct about the sound. I couldnt hear the vocals for shit. We ended up leaving early. The things I did like about the place though was it had a cool atmosphere, the kids were all really into the music and super excited to be there and the security is not so extreme that your uncomfortable to have fun. I hate when you go the a venue and the security guards are a bunch of doosh bags. This is a place where you can let loose and really just go all out. They do not serve booz so it's an all ages venue. So yeh! for the kiddies.

NOT OPEN ON WEEKENDS! If you serve coffee be open on the weekends, please!!  I tried to come here twice and they weren't open. Pretty bummed because I was hoping there was a cafe in walking or bike ride distance from my place. Bummer.

The pink house has an eclectic range of clothing. The prices range from pretty expensive to affordable. It's not just a clothing store either, it has furniture and home accessories. The girls that work there are super cool. And if you are a local artist, the owner rents out space. I would recommend anyone that is looking for something other than the typical mall store to check this place out. And for local artist and clothing designers to check it out as an opportunity to get your stuff out there!

You have to check out Pin Ups salon. I get my hair done by Kristen and have been going to her for years. She is very knowledgeable in her trade and will give you exactly what you want. This is an upscale salon and spa. They offer microdermabrasion, facials and waxing as well. The environment is comfortable and welcoming.   Go check it out and you'll keep going back. This is a great Salon!
