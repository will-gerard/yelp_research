oh the cheese!!!   i went for their monthly cheese tasting (and 3 wine line up). The wine costed an extra 10.   The cheese was honestly really amazing. The staff was very knowledgeable about the food and were able to suggest wines that would compliment the ordered food.   I really loved the experience we had, we learned not only the history about the cheese, but also learned how they are made. It was honestly a fun experience and I would enjoy doing this again. it is pretty pricey but its all for the experience and the fun of it all.

So much food!! I felt stuffed after eating here. This was one of the top Mexican places, off the Basis of being restaurant style mexican food.  Great portions, service is okay, food is delicious, but not to the type that I like. I love/prefer Mexican street food, so yeah. This wasn't my absolute favorite for Mexican food. I would go again though. Don't get me wrong

I have forever been put off from trying mexican seafood. I am not sure why really.  Just something always tells me, don't risk it, you are too young!  So i finally did not listen to my gut feeling and I am glad i didn't. We got their special stone bowl with mocalate...I am 100% i spelled that wrong, there was different meat in it and it was delicious.... I am actually drooling thinking of this dish again.   Yes I will be back and I might just order that again, because it was so good. (i am sure there other items are good too).  I would pass on desserts though.

I like china Chili..  Definitely would come back. I always end up going here maybe 1 every two months. I like specific dishes they have here. Chicken Salad  and Salt and Peppered pork. definitely order those if i come...mostly because it is a craving. I can't turn down jalapenos. :)

Cute small place, don't bring a big group in because it just messes up atmosphere in there. It is a small group place. A nice date night even.   The serve nice freshly made croisants which are bad news for me because that is my favorite carb... :\   To be honest i forget what dish i had when i was here. My wife had a pizza and soup. Mine was delicious i remember that. What it was actually eludes me...  I thought the dish was going to be small, but food is plentiful here, as long as you aren't a college age'd guy, or training for a eating contest, you will most likely be satisfied (not full) here after dinner..   They gave us ALL free desserts at our table! really nice of them

I went here with my family, it was pretty good, definitely not what i was expecting as in order and get your food and grab a seat type deal. Thought there was more table service, BUT it is good how it is.  I really did like all the options and customizability (think i just made that up), for the pizzas.  This place easily could have been a 5 star for me, but the pizza didn't hit out of the park. It was a nice triple, but no home run.   Still it is one of the better pizza places in town i have visited, but not enough to overthrow the crown.   Fun place to come in the afternoon for a lunch with some friends. Very casual feel.   I like how they have a guy directing traffic in the parking lot. if not it'd be a mad house.

Love coming here to Fiddler's. it is a small small place, and it is pretty difficult to find. It is part of a compound or something. I am not sure what the whole property is, but it is odd.  Anyways it is a small acoustics only venue where open mic nights are impressive, and other nights with the talent coming in are chill.  Always has a cover, but that isn't that bad since that cover goes into running the place (i am pretty sure). the usuals here are amazing musicians and you would be lucky to hear them.   I love it when the old guys play they are amazing guitarists

Just backs up all awkwardly..   the food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...  only yelping this because its a check in and i hate seeing things i need to review when i sign on.

Wow, Spinato's well done well done..  Okay since i am yelping this based off  my experience it has to be a 4 not a 5.   The food...amazing, got the signature mama...something something..pizza, the one on the top. We ordered it with some italian sausage, since it doesn't come with meat at all. Well the pizza came out and it was AMAZING...but no sausage :( imagine if it had sausage i would have been happy.  The dough was/is a garlic dough which makes it delicious. I really loved the strong garlic essence coming off the pizza. All the flavors mingled together perfectly to create a sensational bite. (um hog the corner pieces if you can, they be the best) The sauce was sweet, which turned it into a different beast of a pizza. Either way i loved it, but would have loved it more with italian sausage.  The waitress admitted she forgot to add that to our order and made up for it with a discount.. Awesome! she offered we didn't even say eww take it back or anything (because at this point we were too hungry to wait again)  The service was a little awkward at times, but it was great none the less.  Their desserts are really good as well, i am no canolli connoisseur, but this was delicious to me...  i would easily blow my paycheck here IF they had wings too...but the pizza is good enough for half my paycheck...

Um...Karaoke night is terrible.. the speakers are turned up WAY TOO loud so not only do you hear bad singing, but your ear drums get murdered by it... I mean be a DJ and control the sound too, it's not too hard.  Well drinks are nice and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Crappy pours. Bartender needs to go back to school on how to do a decent pour.   Only thing that brings it to two stars is that you can gamble on dog races there. That was new and a little amusing.  Happy hour is okay. They could step up their game if the bartenders would give you a real pour and not make excuses when a drink tastes like more water than it does alcohol or soda... you think to keep good PR you'd at least comp that drink of the customer is adamant on the drink sucking (unfortunately my friend didn't get that normal service).

HAHAHA..this was an adventure gone bad.  My friend and i saw this while we were hanging out. We were hungry and thought....why not, maybe it is a diamond in the rough.  NOPE!!!  it's just rough. The burger i had was bland. no seasoning at all. I've eaten better burgers off a george foreman before... ...  fries were mushy     and it was awkwardly quiet and dead in there.

Great price, great service. The lady who cut my hair knew exactly what i was talking about even though i am horrible at explaining things. I got the exact haircut i was looking for. They give you a free soda with your haircut...SWEET lol.   Its a nice mom and pop style barber shop which i love. This is definitely now my haircut place for phoenix..and its a really really good price... straight edge razor shaves too, those are awesome...   I only got the haircut service, but i do believe they do full straight edge cuts, shampoo, and some other stuff. check their website out for all that they offer... Haircut is 14 dollars, 2 dollars off if it's your first time there.  They also have a punch card which is cool when small mom and pop places do that... They accept card but its a 34 cent charge. so bring cash.

Got a gyro here. I was dissapointed. small portions of meat, and a few pieces of lettuce and tomato, and WAYYYY too much sauce....It was pretty much pita and tsziki half the time..I had high hopes for this place. :(

When my wife and I were there, we both agreed on how to gauge this place.   This is where you bring your kids to have sit down pizza. It is a step up from Peter Piper...okay thats not nice of me to say, it is a big step up from PP, BUT it is no Spinatos by any means.   This has a great local bar feel over on the bar side, but it is far enough where you could bring your children and not worry about the belligerent drunk giving your kids new vocabulary words to try out at school.   The pizza like i was saying is the type to serve to your kids...It is a little bit more pricey than i would prefer, but definitely isn't super greasy like other places.   i might bump them up to 3 stars if I ever visit the bar and it's fun, but i can't see more than a three.

WAYYY better than the one on cave creek rd.   This place makes it fresh and they arent pre-made and sitting waiting for an order.  YOu can taste the difference in being made to order.  Of course this takes a bit longer for it to come out, but it is worth it... Also figuring out which of the 20 doors on the building is the right one to enter from is also tricky..

Boom! my old favorite mexican food place closed awhile back, but this place easily takes my favorites list by storm.  Had the torta pastor and pollo asado burro. Both very delicious. Don't worry i didn't eat both...that would be horrifying. Servings are huge, the place smells EMACULATE! (what you expect an Asadero to smell like). I loved walking in there and getting the most beautiful aroma of bbq'd meat. MMMM  would I go. Yes! the trick is going when they are actually opened. I totally lucked out on this instance. I've only seen it open 3 times and I've drive past 100's of times. maybe i have bad timing. Anyways definitely note worthy on Phoenix's authentic mexican foods to try.

Oh man.. well overpriced drinks, and small portions (including on drinks) makes me laugh. One person in my party got crown on the rocks, i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses.  RIP OFF!  The view is good (not great), the bull is real. the servers are good people, the atmosphere is typical for a steak place. That is where my positive experience ends.  While scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix, it was nice to see all the "mountains" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah. not really mountains to me). Back to the important part everyone...the food. They were greatly overpriced...well my first thought was okay priced high food must be great!...hmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed, well they need to give a bunch of refunds.   The burgers my friend got, looked dry and zero character. It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburger..you know that dry fake looking one. Obviously the burger wasn't that huge, but it looked lame. The pork chop was also VERY dry. Like yeah, i know we are in arizona and most things are dry, but leave the food out of it. It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it. Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible. I got the prime rib. OH YEAH! well thats what i thought. Horse radish was old, lost its pizzazz and kick. They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone.. and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot.. booo). Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money. The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob, and a skimpy helping of green beans.  And just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me.. Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse.. I've had SOO much better before. It was lacking in all areas of its life.   Want to know where you can go and get better food, same ambiance, and decent service (but no view of phx)...Texas Roadhouse...yeah i said it..i am bringing a chain into the discussion.. I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of here.  End of the line 1 star because the food was blech! 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good service...yup two stars...(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one.. HA)

Alright where to start where to start....  Sushi is in really skimpy portions and not even that good to where spending that much for that little is worth it. I have been to some good sushi places that pack a punch in a 4 piece roll. The soft shell crab was okay, but only 4 pieces?!?!!?!?! Like most of their other sushi it was really salty....REALLY REALLY REALLY SALTY. the wasabi had zero potency. The scallops was chopped up...booo, some other places do that too, the worst part was how much salt there was on it. they should have called that a salt roll with a hint of scallops.. BLECH!!!  I also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...  and the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush.   my over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _"enter random fish name here"___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at all

We had a free night stay here from a wedding expo back in the day...yes those actually work!!   Place is pretty nice. I was expecting it to be really lame, but it was a nice hotel.  The bed is made out of down...so it was a little poky....not my preference at all, but it was a nice get away, just to get away.

I was immediately approached when i arrived at the store and they asked me if i needed any help in particular. I said no i was just browsing and they told me to come ask them if i need help with anything... the usual customer service thing.  There was great selection here at the store, a wide variety of types of bikes you got the a small selection of cruiser and hipster bikes. a pretty solid option for hybrids and commuters. large selections for road, cyclocross, tri, mtb (dh and xc). I purchased a new seat when i was there, very fair pricing, not sure about their in shop/labor pricing didn't ask because it is way too far for me to bring my bike to just for some work. The workers are very knowledgeable in their stuff as i heard them talking to other people who needed specific help with things.  I enjoyed this store, not as big of a selection for bars as i thought, seat selection is small but priced well.   They have lots of bontrager and trek brand stuff there, so if you love those brands head on over.  They have lots of information about races and riding information on their brochure stand.

My dad and i have been going to these guys since '05. They are honest guys and wont try to make you fix everything on your car. They will tell you how long you can go with out getting things fixed. They are generally really fast about things. Hao always remembers us when we bring our cars in, and is happy to see us (but who wouldn't be happy about loyal business)  Great local mechanics that know what they are doing. They give you a fair price and don't overcharge for things. Great guys to deal with!  There is a reason why we don't go to any other mechanic in town.

WOAH!! not my scene at all... way too many people for my preference. If i was to describe this place I would say it is filled with people who never lived the college drinking life or miss it soo much that they try to relive it here.  decent drink specials...way tooo crowded. Maybe cause i went on a fight night..There was barely anywhere to sit.

I'm not a connoisseur of Bosnian food, but food to me is like wine. Eat what you like. I liked this place. Was a little greasy but I survived. Probably something I wouldn't have every single day, but once in awhile it's good. I forget what plate I had exactly but it was sausage that came with bread and some toppings.   Also got a pastry that was filo dough and spiraled. It was filled with spinach and cheese. Can't go wrong with that. I think the name of this was a burek.   Easiest way to tell you how I feel.... Yes I will be back. Too bad they don't have a to go menu...

It has some decent deals if you can't wait to find a GREAT deal online. the service is honestly weird.  The guy had no sense of personal space and was all up in my grill and would stand awkwardly next to me like he had nothing better to do.  I didn't feel too comfortable there, and the sale person tried to keep pressuring me to buy. All the way to the point where i just put the few things i had in my hands down and just left...buying online wins again... specifically amazon prime ftw.

Went here, they were out of everything. They messed up all of our orders and even after they fixed them i wasn't impressed by the food.   I am not impressed, but also because i was expecting a lot. (go in with low expectations i guess?)

Fun place to go. It was a nice date night. Definitely a lounge more than anything. A few lower seating and couches. Everything else is a hightop or at the bar.   I saw people come in wearing t-shirt and shorts and others wearing button up shirt with jeans. I think the later is more appropriate for this place.   Food is good, its more about the ambiance of this place. Live music late at night!

Went here cause i wanted japanese style sushi.   This place converted a patio into a Arizona/sun room and then A/C'd it. Doesn't really match the whole "japanese"/sushi feel they had going on inside. Anyways enough about the decor.  I read some reviews, people said it was japanese style sushi. Well it was, but it was knock down great. I love to gauge sushi bars off of their Sashimi. Um... thats where they dropped on their face pretty hard.   I mean this is the livelihood of your restaurant, I was expecting some pretty good sashimi since the price was up on that end. The salmon had that old fish taste and smell, something that didn't really leave you saying i want more. The Tuna, BLECH! it didn't even taste anything recognizable.    We had two rolls, those were alright, but have gotten equally "alright" tasting rolls for half the price.  Wont be back. :( sad day

iced dirty chai, comes out to 5 dollars even (medium size). It was good, i think i read that they make the chai by scratch, so no concentrate. thats a bonus. I really like this place, but its a little far to be my local coffee shop. I really like the decor (not sure what it would be called), but the place is a little confusing at first. I saw the sign/billboard, but only saw the italian restaurant. Thankfully i wandered the correct direction. I walked in and the entrance is actually the side of the shop (if there is another oops). i was a little confused but made my way through, knowing i was in the correct location because everyone had coffee cups, iced and hot. I found the "menu" on a glass written with liquid chalk (love it). and pastries all over!   The pastry choices were plentiful, finding where to order a little difficult, because it looked like it was part of the pastry "display table". i'd come back i like the atmosphere a lot + it's next to slippery pig bike shop!

Came here a handful of times recently. I sat at the bar and always have a fun bartender and friendly bartender helping me.  The beer choices for Amber's/Red's are not that great. The ones they do have range from Terrible to Middle level. (In my beer book). They give you a ton of fries with your order.  There isn't much option when it comes to the burgers, which is sad. I'd expect more from them.

I love chino's 7Q and 6 No beans and extra Pork Fried Rice. Thats my dish, its my love. I think everytime im back in phoenix i make a stop at chino's because it is that good. I love how you can get (almost) anything on the menu either in a burrito or quesadilla. That makes everything glorious..  So i guess you can be a skeptic at first, chinese and mexican food? yah i thought it sounded weird but EVERYONE i've taken there have always liked it!  This place is one of the best places to eat in phoenix. Very casual and its my favorite way of eating.. Pay first then after you can leave! no need to wait for someone to bring you your check.  If it is your first time going go to the side counter and let them know and they will let you sample the types of food they offer.  Don't expect people to wait on you hand and foot, this just isnt the place for that, if you want that kind of service go to Maggiano's (which is not the same cuisine fyi)

I had a pork dish when i was here. It was pretty good. The wait here was long. Definitely make reservations next time we come.  The nachos we had as an appetizer was large, we split it between 7 people (remember an appetizer not a meal). Everyone had different dishes, most of my family got Tacos. They looked really good and tasted even better..  Food was well prepared and consistent throughout.  Next time we will have to try to sit outback, because i hear it has a nice view.

Actually shaved gyro meet. not pre-cut, spam looking gyro meet. This place gives SOOOO much food. I love it. When my wife and I go we split the gyro platter/plate for dinner. Sometimes we will get a salad to split as well, but to be honest we have left overs sometimes. So much meat...can't ever complain. You have to come to this place sometime.  They can packed really quickly so make sure you plan accordingly. First time we went we got in right before temple got out. We got lucky but everyone after us had a 45+ min wait.

I realized i haven't yelped this place even though i have been here at least once a year since moving here.  Okay so maggiano's in my opinion is only worth it if you are going to do family style eating...heck yes all you can...  I only come here on special occasions with my family, when everyone is in town. We ordered i think almost all the combinations of food you can think of for the family style. I really love their stuffed mushrooms and calamari appetizers. Those are always a good pre-game snack, but it turns into a pre-game meal because of it being bottomless.  There are too many main courses for me to remember, but i enjoy them all especially with it being...yes all you can eat.  The dessert, get the cream puffs those are amazing monsters of joy...and i think sometimes i save half my stomach just to throw down 2-3 of those.   I really enjoy this place for family outings because its about eating up. But really who would turn down high quality all you can eat food?? it's not a buffet so you will have to shovel out a pretty penny for the family style eating.

Most amazing brunch i've ever had. There was a couple here who said best in AZ and they have been coming here for 20+ years.   Well they started us off on high expectations and DH delivered. Delivered completely.   The bartender/server here was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Like the ins and outs of the menu. We asked for some recommendations and he said anything with the carne adovada is great. This was true.  My wife got the carne adovada benedict. I got the rellenos and eggs with red and green sauce. both of these dishes were amazing. My rellenos were/are perfect eggs were cooked amazingly. We watched the chef prepare our dishes and wow it was filled with anticipation of: "is that what i ordered? that looks soo good".  The carne adovada, like the server said was amazing. It was tender, delicious and delicious and delicious. I don't know how else to describe it. The meat was juicy, not dried out which lots of places have dry meat. the Egg to the benedict was perfect and runny. I've had some benedicts recently where they served it basically soft boiled and swear thats how its supposed to be.  Also the hollandaise was delicious. it was a perfect fit on this benedict. Really well made, even smooth texture. Yet  still rich (which is what you want).   This place is DARK! so older people be aware and sit somewhere with a light so you can see your menu. The room with the tables would be best for more lighting. I loved how dark it was. It really gave the place an old time feel. When you walk in your hit with a burst of a nice smokey smell from their wood fire grill. There is the bartop with a few high tops to sit at as well.  The backroom has three large tables which could accomodate a group of people. Definitely not a child friendly place if it was to be packed. I am not sure how crowded it gets, but by the taste of their brunch I am sure they get really packed. We went on a Thursday morning and there were only a handful of people there. It was a little bit busier by the time we left.   My recommendation. Sit at the bar/hightop area, its a better experience. Ask the server for his/her recommendations. sit back and relax.

I was honestly having a hard time deciding if i should give them 4 or 5 stars. I am going to swing the 5 stars because leftovers were equally as good the day after.  This place is cafeteria style restaurant. Which is good, you see your food being prepared before your very eyes. The ribs were DELICIOUS!! the meat fell off the bone cleanly. I am salivating a little bit thinking about them again. They do a real good job cooking the ribs. They don't over smother the ribs with sauce which is nice. You can add more on your own. A great smoky flavor in each bite.  Mac N cheese side was good. I wish that the crunchies on top were more crunchy, but thats my own personal preference.   My wife had the salad, with chicken ontop. That was pretty good too. IF we didn't get meat on the salad it would have been a sad day.   I'd love to come back sometime, its just a little far from me. :(

i swear i wrote a review for this place before...anyways, here goes again.  Great beer, great food.  If you never had a cornish pasty before well you are missing out on a lot. The chefs here put a lot of thought into each pasty because the flavors really compliment each other and the crust is nice and flaky (how i prefer).   This place is a pure dive bar... if locals scare you...don't go around here because that is all you are going to get.   Thinking about cornish pasty co. is making me hungry. i am going to have to stop by sometime this upcoming week to meet this craving now...thanks yelp...

This place is not bad. I visited this place before they changed over. I am glad they changed over. its a lot cooler of a place. When we went, I guess one of their servers called out sick.. Thank God. I would have not been happy if my server was hacking up a lung.   Bad thing about that situation was it was one server that night. Poor lady was running around. There were some loud annoying and rude people there. I am sure the server felt overwhelmed.  We will come back, but if it looks like the same situation we might go else where instead of trying to wade through that nonsense again.

People that work here/own the place are very very nice and considerate. Their cookies speak for themselves, they are yum, i love their ice cream cookie (only available in the summer) too bad they don't come with other cookies.   This place deserves going to at least once if you are in phoenix

yeah, ice cream cookies in the summer probably the highlight of my time here in phoenix, but their cupcakes from (ole cakes, same business). Are also delicious. When you cut into the cupcake itself and you hear the cake speak to you...literally you just can't help but get overly excited and when you take that bite your excitement is met by pure carnal hedonism... get that!

I got to talk with "Crazy Ken", he is a great guy and kept encouraging me to go group riding which i will do. I literally came in to burn time, but to be honest i had the best experience i ever had in a bike shop. No one gave me snobby looks, he listened to my confusion and self proclaimed cluelessness for what i was really doing. He helped me out a lot. We got to talk a lot about my bike, and i am pretty sure i want this to be "My bike shop".

I don't really frequent the butcher shops around town, but I think i will start. I bought a groupon here... and so did everyone else who was there. They do not have a number/line system so it was kind of like being at the bar trying to get a drink and showing enough skin to get service..ha!   Never being at a butcher shop before. The experience was alright, once i was being helped customer service was great, but upon walking in..didn't feel too welcome.  (it was busy when i walked in soo, it could have been that too).   Like I said, first time shopping at a butcher shop...so I think the meat selection was okay. In my mind I expected more of a selection, but this could be a great or weak selection...like i said...i am new to going to these shops.   Loved the cuts I did get. The meats had great marbling which of course made my meats turn out great when I slow cooked them.   I will say, if you are soft spoken and indecisive you may have a difficult time.  I'm giving this place 4 stars, BECAUSE on saturdays they have/do a bbq and I got some lunch there with the meat I bought. They don't put anything special on their brisket, but it was so nicely, that It didn't need anything. Just straight enjoy the brisketness of the brisket.

if you haven't been here then it is your loss. Chimichanga style it all. haha no, but really all the food here is delicious. I love their in-house, hand made tortillas. Definitely a plus for me.   You can't really argue with that, but just incase you can. Go try the food on your own. I normally get the same thing every time (a combo chimichanga) and i never walk away dissappointed...unless i was super hungry.   This place will most likely satisfy the regular eater, but you super eaters/college kids, sumo's in training, or have eaten a buffet out of business in one night...this probably wont satisfy you.

Went to watch Romeo and Juliet with my wife. We loved the performance. It is a little confusing to get into, but we managed to finally find an entrance. (the box office is off 2nd street). Sat really close to the front, 6th row. We got there late and had to sit up top. Anywhere you sit really is great acoustics and the view.  I really enjoyed the orchestra playing below us. No single instrument was overly dominant. IT was a good balance the whole time.  I'd go back for another show. (snacks are okay.)

Chodang, my favorite Korean place in greater phoenix area.   Definitely not the world. When i am craving korean food this is my place of preference. Dolsot Bibimbap is good here. They don't skimp on their food.  The spiciness is on the lower end of my spice preference. Their hot is under the level of a jalapeno (in my opinion). This IS nice though because you are eating out of joy, not pain of spice.   Anyways soondubu (i spelled that wrong i am sure) is good...  again i am saying not the best ever, just my favorite in the greater phoenix area.

This is a nice small place, very friendly staff. The food here is pretty good, I got some sisig. The last time I had sisig i was actually in the philippines, so I feel me comparing the two would be unfair.  :)  Be prepared for some karaoke if you go.

For the whole story of my experience here refer to Aletheia's post (my sis).  I wanted to put my two cents in that it was extremely over priced and the katsu was really really dry. As an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in Phoenix.  Definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\  good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that... Definitly not going back again...unless it is free.

I have been here a bunch and have not yelped this place...I think it is time i do right by them because they do right for my stomach.   The rushes here are really random so make sure you give them a call and see how busy they are. If they are busy i would say hold off on going for a little bit. They expanded their restaurant, but the kitchen is the same size and cannot efficiently handle a packed restaurant.   I really recommend getting the fried catfish curry, that literally is the best thing on the menu hands down. I love it soo much. I can't not get this when i go.  I enjoy all their spicy food to rate it a 1 is like peppercorn spice, 3-4 is a mild jalapeno  and 5 is around a spicy jalapeno and serano.   Service is always been good, everyone is polite. The only time when service is slow/bad when the place is getting packed.   This place is where i go when i crave some thai food for sure.

I mean it's a bar they have drinks. If that is what you are going for cool. You can catch a game there, its not bumpn like it used to. Its a little on the quiet side.   The crowd looks like its about a 40+ group. and a good handful of random creepers checking out the serve staff there.   I wouldn't say i wont come back. But its definitely not first on my list for the kinda of bar scene i'd normally be looking for.  Service was good. but thats because there wasnt many other people to serve the day when i went.

There is such a large assortment of teas here. I am admittedly new to teas, and i confessed that to the lady working. Needless to say she was not a snob and was more than happy to help me in finding out what i wanted. All i know i said is that i enjoy black teas the most, but i do love them all.   This got us started on searching for teas which were my "cup of tea" . She asked, you going to drink them hot or cold? i paused and thought its getting hot outside, lets say cold.   I ended up getting Tropical Sunset, and Black Currant. The price is a lot cheaper than i thought it would be, after going to those chain tea shops in the malls and just looking at prices.  Definitely will be back since it is right down the road and has a nice studying atmosphere there.  i purchased 100g total and only spent 10 dollars. I mean, first time purchasing and i think it's a pretty good deal.  They all smell good, i'd eat them if it was okay for you to do that haha.

This place is a fun and great concept. I didn't like how everything were slider styles. So if i could i would rank this 3.5 but we can't so i rounded it up because the service/bartender was great.  To be honest trying out all their "exotic meats" do interest me, but i could pass on them because they are just sliders.   It's to be honest the make your own mac n cheese thats really good. I love that and would go back to do it again. reasonable price for it (in my opinion)

YES!!! and YES and YES!! too bad i don't live closer. I really love this place.  They get a huge four stars off the bat because they are supporters of Pedal Craft. I love that!!  Boulders has a great tap selection that fluctuates often. The food is good. Not great, but the atmosphere easily makes up for it.   It is a dive that you could go to every day and even take a casual date to without feeling like you're slumming it.   Dive bars = win  Bars that love cycling = 5 star win.  I prefer this to the big brewery places closer to that community college down the road...  BEAR DOWN!!

Wish i had enough time to go try the food when i was there. I just had some drinks to go.  They really do a fine job with their lattes. Out of the places i have tried in the last month (aside from spots i frequent) this was easily the best. Definitely wont be going out there to frequent because that is just way out of the way.  But definitely if you have time to spare and need a delicious caffinated drink. I'd recommend ground control. I'd love to try them out during the evening when it looks like they turn into a nice wine and beer restaurant.

Roka was pretty good, i recommend getting sashimi here based almost soley on the fact that they give you fresh ground wasabi with it!!! i have a love affair for horse radish so um, yeah i enjoyed the wasabi from that.  Very good food, but to be honest it better for being at the price range it was at.  The server was good and friendly. This place has a more laid back atmosphere and so there really isn't a server breathing down your neck all the time trying to bombard you with service. They show up at the correct time and always are willing to help you if you need it.   We had a spider roll, dynamite, the korean pork belly with kimchi, and yellowtail sashimi. The spider roll was the better of the two rolls.  They gave us an aioli sauce with the spider roll, that really had no benefit to the dish at all. It was there but didn't add anything special. On the Dynamite it was actually dissapointing. The Scallops were sliced soo thinly ontop that it was virtually not there. Couldn't taste it and it ended up just being just an EHHH type of roll. I'd pass on that next time.  The Korean Pork Belly was really good, it had a nice and might i say beautiful char on it which not only provided a great smokey flavor (not burnt flavor mind you), but also gave it the characteristic we all wish for... the melt in your mouth. I'd definitely would want to get this dish again. Putting a piece of the home made kimchi on it with a bite was a winner. Home-made kimchi was impressive because i wasn't expecting too much from it. Definitely was NOT my favorite kimchi, but it was a lot better than i thought it would be.  Lastly as i eluded to earlier the sashimi was not only cut beautifully and fresher than other places i've had, but it was served with fresh ground wasabi. should i say more? too bad i will, I LOVE fresh ground wasabi. I seriously just started eating it by itself, don't regret it at all. Honestly an amazing experience on the sashimi part.   I'd come back definitely and hope to some time.

BLECH! get that poisonous taste out of my mouth...  Their chai tea (original chai style) is disgusting. Just cause it says its a spicy tea doesn't mean capsaicin spice. BLECH!!  I laughed when the guy there said, "This isn't starbucks, they make real coffee here" to his friend walking in.  The reason why i laughed is that Starbucks is a sugary coffee place, and this place also is a massive sugar overload central place too..  soo yes it isn't starbucks, but with the amount of sugar they put in their drinks they might as well be....

so sadly mediocre i had to just take one star off. The food left me feeling disgusting afterwards.  Most fried foods do, but you know when there is more batter than fish, and oil than batter that your food isn't going to be good.   If i could go back in time i would have walked next door and gone to Spinatos nuff said.  there really isnt any type of PR at all going on. Infact you have to initiate everything. Go up to the counter and say what you want. Don't wait to be asked, don't ask what they like cause they wont really respond...but maybe they were giving me an honest answer cause i certainly didn't like anything here.

I feel like i yelped this place before but i guess not...Cadillac was okay for food. Bartenders are good they do their job and give you great pours.   Food on the 15 minutes or it's free menu actually do come out at  15 minutes on the dot.. Yeah i timed it, what?   I wouldn't really come back there are just too many other better bars than this place to go to.  Also i do prefer dives so that is my bias views for you.

Yen Sushi is my favorite (korean style) sushi up in the N. phoenix area. Now mind you i have to give this stars based off of other places here in AZ.. If i was to grade them against sushi places i have been to in other places it would round out at 2 stars. But for this area yeah a four star.  Happy hour here is the best time to come, but also the worst. Best because the deals and the food. Worst because its PACKED! you gotta get here early if you can.   I definitely don't mind dropping by this place to hit my random sushi craving. Its good enough to satisfy my pallet.  Fried rolls are good, but their fresh rolls are better.  I enjoy the staff as well. They are willing to talk and joke with you and don't act like they have a stick up their butt.

Vermicelli dishes have great portion compared to other places here in the valley.   The broth for the pho tastes fresh and they have a good amount of options.  Like any pho place should be service is quick. Getting food out doesn't take long and we had a party of 6. I definitely will be back to this place.  It is a little awkward when you walk in, not sure if you seat yourself or you get seated. I think either or will work here.  There is a yogurt place inside too. Didn't try it. But some of my friends say its okay.   Definitely one of your cleaner pho options intown as well.

this place was good i got a espresso ice cream, i had this earlier in the summer so i don't remember my experience too well (sorry). But i do remember they can have parties there because a group of girls who were there for their friends bday party went to the backroom, where i am sure they had an icecream bonanza. Good choices.

I had a living social coupon for this place and decided to capitalize today.  I called in and made an appointment. It wasn't busy at all when i went in (Tuesday Afternoon). I got the "Real Deal" package, they definitely knew what they were doing. My barber was very very thurough for my WHOLE haircut, and the shaving and shampoo afterwards.   It was definitely what you expect a barber shop to look like. The atmosphere and the barbers were welcoming and they actually talked to you and asked you about yourself.   I don't know what is considered a normal price at barber shops and what isn't, but this place seemed to be higher up than other barber shops i have visited prior. (From my time in seattle and tucson).  Overall though they seem to be the best barber shop i have been to ever, so the price is deserved from the service.

I got a thai tea here while i waited for the train from hell to finish passing/start moving again. first things first, not impressed with the taste. It was way watered down flavor and the powder that was used was not well mixed and had chunks in it. YUCK every other sip was a powder chunk, but it wasn't powdery it was gummy because it was melted by the hot water she put in, but then cooled off way too fast (before it was able to completely dissolve).   I love the location and the warm feel of the place, but the drinks were just not worth it. and it was waaay to expensive for its low quality. I probably wont come back to try another drink, the easy stuff was bad i don't have high hopes for the rest

To compare with another tamale place that I used to frequent, this place wins based on the tamales.   Their tamales here are good, the masa is perfect texture and isn't too dry. They sell a few of them hot during any given day. They sell all of theirs frozen everyday, pending not getting sold out.  Only thing which is a little upsetting, is that it isn't a restaurant. There is only a small sitting area to wait. If you get your food you get it to go. Also, it's tamales only, no real sides to get with your food. I wish they had more, but for what they are 5 stars. I love some good tamales.  Their hours are reminiscent of them not being a restaurant.

This place is definitely diner style food/breakfast, but great taste with it. I had the Cali omelet. it was so good, and decent sized!  Would i go back? yes i would. Way better than getting a twice as expensive breakfast on the strip (which is way smaller too)

Always good food at cornish pasty.   I've been to their smaller shop over next to ASU.  This one definitely is a lot more of a refined atmosphere. I actually prefer the smaller one because it was very "divey".  If you want to have a more classy place to go to come to this location.  All in all if you haven't been to cornish pasty, or had one before definitely have to try at least once.  the one with lamb is the best.. (unless you don't like lamb, then i dont think you will agree with me)

Second time i came in, food is pretty expensive, but its well worth it.  I do recommend getting the bruschetta, you pick 4 different ones (which are cut into nice 4 slices each). We got the salmon, roasted peppers, tomato jam, and procsiotto (sp?). They were really good, i think i want to try some others ones, definitely don't get all of one kind unless you are afraid of change. If that is the case i don't know why you are trying somewhere new to eat.  Food was really good, i got the half panini and soup of the day. The panini i chose was the 9 iron. Not enough burratta i love the flavor of burratta, and just enjoy having a few of them to eat. Oh this is making me long for some fresh burratta.

you know what, this place was delicious especially for a pub.  to be honest food is a big deal here and i love that the most. The hangover burger is what i decided to get with sweet tots. I get my burger medium rare...and wow...WOW the most perfectly cooked medium rare burger i have ever had... I bit into the burger and instead of a dry lifeless burger i bit into a 30-70 to a 20-80 burger that just had its delicious flavor pouring out from the first bite till the last. and It isn't on some random bun its on a beautifully fresh bun(kaiser i believe)  the tots...amazing because....sweet potato tots...whats not to love about this?? oh the fact that they were crisp and not mushy...yes to LOVE! how about the fact that it wasnt a greasy glob..YES LOVE!!!!!   in short great pub to hang and watch any of the countless games with friends, great restaurant for the food.....together...the ultimate game night destination...   Happy hour is only on the bar side fyi.

I don't go eat fish and chips too often but this food was pretty good. I got the catfish, fish and chips plate. It was very good. The food came out in a hurry. The fries weren't anything special, i wish the seasoning was sprinkled more generously.  The workers and maybe owner, not sure. Where nice people and talked us up, gave us some 1 off coupons. I want to try different things they have on their menu as well.  The catfish was good, came out freakishly hot and be warned, don't bite into it, break a piece off and attack cautiously. The breading wasn't in excess, it was enough to give that flavor and crunch, but didn't over power my catfish flavor. They have tilapia, whiting, and shrimp as well. Their vinegar tomato sauce deal, was eh.... and tartar sauce i wish had more kick. That is what really prevented them from getting a 5 star.   i will come back because it is right next to my work, i love little mom and pops like this.

I can't decide...3 or 4 stars???  service is probably what is going to push it up to four.  This place has the best Thai Tea that i've had up north. This is what sets it apart for me.  Their spice is a full heat, NOT a pinpoint, kill you, unenjoyable pain.  We always get Pa-Nang when we eat Thai. This place has one to rival some of our favorite places in town.  I would love to come back and see if they were a good or bad fluke the time we went.

Burger I had here was good. I shouldn't have waited so long to write my review. I don't remember much about the food anymore. We did enjoy it when we were there. Lots of the appetizers are good for sharing between two people.   Service is always great here. Come to be treated well for sure.

I love it. A great place to go for the music lovers. If you bring small children definitely plan on going to one exhibit and making an immediate B-line for the interactive exhibit.   I could easily spend the whole day here. Its a little pricey, but its worth it if you appreciate music.

these guys are real and fun to just hang out with and talk. Charlie gave me a haircut and we were just talking and watching tv. The normal things you would expect to do at a barber shop. It's a little warm in there but bearable. Definitely will be back, had a great time there. Usually when i go into barber shops i just sit and get a haircut but these guys were engaging and funny.  Good stuff

Cute small breakfast place! No wait when we got there. It was really good. I got the quiche and my wife got one of the benedicts (california i think).   The quiche was good, I really liked the benedict though. The benedict actually is predominant in my mind more than my quiche. Anyways. If you want to know if i'd be back.. definitely would be. Its a cute place to go grab a coffee, and have breakfast/brunch with a SMALL group of friends.   It's worth waiting for, and if you can't wait order to go. Problem solved :)

Where do i even begin?, here is where we will start. It was a dark night, and we were craving some gyros. Who doesn't crave that? I read some great reviews of them and had to try it out.  Unfortunately this place really ruined my day. It was pretty busy when we walked in, but 90% of the people there had already been served and were eating, so we figured the wait wouldn't be bad at all. We (only 2 of us) ordered our food, no one was in front of us in line so our food went into the kitchen and we sat and waited...and waited. 10 minutes rolled by, no food. But we were starving. 10 minute wait isn't bad at all. A  man comes in and places a huge order, then a couple comes in after him and makes a small order... A total of 45 minutes later (i was watching the clock so this is not an exaggeration) the couple gets their food, and we are sitting there and waiting. 75  minutes rolls by, at this time i am pretty upset and starving (bad combination), the guy with the HUGE order gets his food. I walk up to the counter and ask. Is our food ready? They ordered after us and we are STILL waiting. I showed them my pay stub and time and told them what we ordered.  90 minutes rolls up (yes 1 hour and 30 minutes after we ordered) we FINALLY got our food! Am i kidding you or over exaggerating? I wish i was.   Now it doesn't matter how good the food was at this point i was pissed. Needless to say, the food was mediocre and not worth the wait at all. What should you do if you are hungry and wanting some gyros to eat? You should go down the road a little to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, because at least there they don't botch your order...  Usually i would give places a second try. This place i will not. Mainly because...There was no apology or acknowledgment of how ridiculously long we had to wait for food.  If you're a business you have to have better PR

Have you ever been talking with your friends and they begin to tell you how great of a swimmer they are? Then they run and belly flop and begin to just sink to the bottom? No?? I haven't either, but if i had, this would be that friend.  Considering that this place boasts its presence with being right in old town Scottsdale you think they would have experience, food, and service.   I contemplated 1 star but that would be unfair to the first server who did a great job.   Shall we continue? Upon arriving they seemed busy inside and didn't have a table ready. My party had already been sitting and waiting for awhile when the rest of us arrived. They had 2 small children and 1 pregnant woman. Let's have them sit outside without water for awhile. Thats what we did. Finally a server came over and brought us water promptly.  Kind of a big deal to not be aware of your waiting patrons (especially if all you have is outdoor waiting in ARIZONA.)   Once seated, server came over, said hi and left. (i don't know why the rest of my party left their waters outside, i brought mine in). She never brought over or asked us if we would like waters. I guess seeing one cup for 8 people is sufficient.  Well 10 minutes later a group walks in same size and sits in the booth across from us. As we wait for our server to come back and take our order 20-25 minutes later, she instead goes to take the order of our neighbors. Um hi..we are waiting still.   After long awkward anticipation of trying to "flag her down" (granted she could have been busy, but she was chatting with the hostesses a lot, so who knows) she comes over and takes our long awaited dinner orders..we are striding along 45-50 minutes to take our order. When the other group was promptly attended to (10-15min). Oh heck yes i really was timing..   Order goes, 10 minutes  later appetizers come out and 1hr later (yes i realize it takes awhile to get food out especially 8 dishes) our dinner comes, or i think it is our dinner. We had 3 messed up orders. 3 overly cooked burgers..i tasted them it was so dry not even drink our 1 cup of water between 8 people could re hydrate that.  I mean i am a guy, most things can be fixed for me with just a GOOD (not even great) meal. But they couldn't even capitalize on that.. I am pretty sure a "good" meal could have come through better.  Heh, my meal was some chicken sandwich, thank God it was cooked all the way through. It was definitely slopped together. There was a GLOB of sundried tomatoes placed only in the middle, showing me that they cared so much to just ladle out the st's. I mean it was okay, but nothing i'd pay that much.  Hey i am a nice guy, lets talk about our neighbors.. by the time we got our food they were done eating and paying for their bill (they had 7 people). hmmm  i could go on, but really...whats the point? you get the idea...i wont be back

Okay i am really really close to giving this place 5 stars.   The staff was very friendly when we walked in. We were met with a smile and promptly seated where we can watch them make our crepes (via tv). The whole decor of the place was like being in the alps. I loved the whole look and feel of the place. Nothing was out of the ordinary at all, they definitely knew what they wanted when building/designing it.   I did not go here for the dessert or the fondue (but we want to come back and try just that, and if thats good then it will def move up to 5 stars). We both had savory crepes, which btw were delicious. It is a little pricey but the portion sizes are large here so nothing too much to worry about.   I got the Fermiere (sp?) savory crepe, it was chicken, sauteed onions, swiss cheese, and cream of mushroom. Wow this was really great, first off read the ingredients of course its going to be delicious. The cheese is "freshly" imported from switzerland (i think thats where the server said).  The cheese was full and flavorful. I loved the crepe very much, great complimenting flavors. The other dish we got was the Mont St. Michel, which is salmon, lemon, dill sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. This was a cold served crepe and was equally as delicious as my fermiere. What i really liked about this place was the proteins in the plate. You can simply taste the quality and freshness of each. The salmon was perfectly smoked, not over powering and still moist and not discolored. The chicken was obviously grilled chicken breast, you could taste the char from the grill on the chicken which i think is AWESOME!  To wrap it up i left content with what i had to eat...  the neighboring table had a meat dish which was cooked with burning burboun (i think it was burboun). i forget the name but the waitress said it was their "signature dish" so it must be good...smelled amazing..also on my list of things to try as i WILL be back here to try again.

Fun place. Drinks are pretty freakn pricey. Stick to the beer and your wallet will be okay. They have things to do here though which is awesome! drinking beer, playing a number of games like cornhole, shuffle board, ping pong. who can ask for more?  great place to hang out with some friends for sure.

The server we had is a really nice guy. Loved the atmosphere it is as you would expect a nice lounge to come sit and enjoy a drink or two with a friend.   I don't know if i would necessarily come here for food, but for a more "adult" kick back with some friends this place is a must....And when i say adult i don't mean strip club...

i've been here before. Had a great experience when i bowled, but this time :\ kinda got off to a bad start.  Purchased the Yelp offer (pay 10 get 20, to spend here). When we arrived the guy working the desk, (forget his name) told me and my friends we could not use this during cosmic bowling.. I looked on the "fine print" and there was none of that at all.  Well yeah we didn't want to stand there and argue because we honestly just wanted to bowl and have fun.  The rest of the night went well, But i can't believe they wouldn't accept the yelp offer. Messed up...especially considering people who buy them are YELPERS!   you dug your own grave man....

Went to POAF, they are a little pricey, but seriously the brisket hit the spot. Nice and smokey, had great flavor (when does a brisket not?), wasn't drenched in sauce. To be honest i could have eaten it without adding any sauce. So delicious. Their sauces are good too.   The line was a little confusing but i figured it out pretty quickly. Get there before 11:45. that is when the rush gets in there.

YES!!! this was soo good, a little messy but good. It is at a farmers market on Wed and Saturdays from 8am-1pm ish. I went around 12 and the wasn't a big line.  I got my dog pretty fast and wow was it amazing. I got the Aiko with a Hot Beer Dog. The spices were perfect and soo tasty. The Aiko had Mango Chutney, Jalapenos, Mayo, (something else but i can't remember). This was served on flatbread/pita or whatever you want to call it. It was quite different way to eat your dog, but wow I love the idea and it was super good.   Got my food in about 3 minute wait, there isn't really too many tables to sit at so prepare to be friendly with some strangers or learn how to stand and eat. I am not afraid of strangers yet soo i sat with one and ate.   Be aware if you have big sleeves food will fall in it ... mango chutney was in my jacket sleeve...soo my arm smelled REAL good after. I did get a "complain" that my breath smelled like mango chutney...but whatever i think they were just jealous of me getting some good food :)  oh yeah 5 dollar a specialty dog...heck yes good deal, it filled me up!

I think i have yelped their other location on Mill.  This one is exponentially better because there are no crazies or drunk college students here. YAY!  I normally get pretty standard flavors here. Nothing fancy. I got the naranja and my wife the coconut (don't know the name of that one). They were good as we knew they would be and expected them to be.  They have stickers all over their wall that you can slap one up there. mine is the upside down one on the speaker.

um...not much to really say about the place. ribs are lower end of the decent ranks. (decent is middle for me). Definitely wont order the babybacks again. thats what i had. I don't know this place was just ehhhhhhh.. nothing fantastic, i'd come back if i had a giftcertificate and i wouldn't complain.  Don't think i would choose on my own accord to go here though. I'd rather go to one of those fastfood bbq places which make equally as good, sometimes better food.

Service was good. The stars do not reflect the quality of service. The food on the other hand was not that great. It did not posses the flavor of what you would expect of a sit down type of pizza place. I am surpirsed since I have been to MyPie (their sister restaurant) and it is better pizza and food overall.  My qualms: Garlic knots, lack of garlic taste, the oil or butter was slopped all over this. It really was an excessive amount of oil/butter. The marinara sauce that came with it was bland, it didn't seem to be seasoned by much. The pizza was extremely greasy as well. The topings couldn't stay on the pizza when you picked it up because of the grease. The crust at the end was good, but underneath the pizza was soggy. Sad :( The sauce used for the pizza was similar to the garlic knots sauce and left a lot to be desired.  The pictures of the pizza on yelp look amazing and completely different than my experience. Maybe it was an off night for them, but it definitely did not leave me saying, oh this is a place i want to come back to.  The mac and cheese was good. I could have done without bacon on it (but others at my table wanted it on). Maybe their other foods aside from pizza are good. You would assume, if a place is called crust their pizza would be good.   Its not that I don't like this place, I enjoy going to their sister shop, and would recommend that over coming here.

Hey this place is small, nice, has friendly staff, and is hipster enough to feel unique, and not hipster enough so you don't feel like a tool for going.  I got the frape, thought it was european style frape, where they shake it up.Nope its their play on the starbucks frappacino. It is way better than the corporate version, Less sugar and actually tastes...good ... yeah i said it.  I'd go again if i was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get some coffee here. Nothing knock your socks off awesome. Worth trying if you are in the area though.

Okay it's a buffet so i am rating this against other buffet's but it doesn't really matter because it gets one star either way.  Variety is bad here, (one the layout is crappy and could have been better used to maximize space and provide more table space for different options) . The food i couldn't find one thing i like, not even vegetables. Oh wait i lied, the fried sweet donut was good and the hibachi grill was decent for a buffet one.  Bad part about the hibachi grill...i was waiting there for 5 minutes before the chef even came out of the backroom to start cooking my food. Also i got a glimpse of the backroom when he opened the door, i wish i didn't GROSS!!!  Also they had some workers cleaning snow peas on a table where people eat....i decided to avoid snowpeas for my trip after seeing that. Not a food surface and not okay.  Plus side, this place is really clean for a buffet. Lots of places to sit so you can bring a group. The price is very reasonable...but than again you pay for what you get...cheap price cheap/crap food.  Wait i'm not done...thats right i am not done. The wait staff was horrible, All the other 4 that were on duty were too busy talking to each other, braiding each others hair and gossiping about customers while one guy was busy busting his butt off trying to wait on a dozen or more tables all over the restaurant. Not only was it one guy doing it all, but this guy barely spoke any english (i am not hating on him for not speaking english), He REALLY REALLY could have used some help from the chatty kathy's in the back. Hopefully they wont have to split tips, because none of the other workers deserved it.

This place can easily be missed if you are driving by, but to be honest. its not worth missing...  I am glad i finally made my trek down 32nd st to shea. Cause this place is awesome. Nice "quaint" little sit down cafe. Perfect for studying, reading, or enjoying your post hike on any of the number of trails around here. They have a small food menu. Sandwiches are delicious btw. I am pretty sure the chips are homemade, they are not too salty which is perfect..i'd be okay with zero salt too.   I had their tea, it was delicious. Also had a nutella hot chocolate, really wish it had more chocolate/nutella flavor. But otherwise it was awesomely delicious. I willllll be back. Especially when i need my cup of  coffee in the A.m.

Uh....fail...i expected more from this place, but i should have known better because the last place which was here, that was good, failed.   Anyways the side dishes...uh..thanks for ripping me off, only 3 different things and four if you include the community kimchi. It was crappy sides they gave you too. The presentation of it was thoughtful, each person had their own little three spot dish which had a little side in each, but like i said ripped off.   Dolsot, bowl wasn't even close to being hot enough to get the rice crispy...it was the gross inbetween where it gets stuck in your teeth because it was hard, but still gooey. One or the other, can't be both, well it could be both, but then it will suck... (it sucked). The hot sauce which was included was more of a flavor than a spice, which made me really sad because i like spicy food.   The Soondubu (seafood one), okay good amount of tofu in there, good seafood, but again...not really spicy... the broth wasn't that flavorful either.   only bright spot...the kimchi...two stars for that...

GET SOME!! go now seriously and get some.  This place is easily now my top favorite mexican food joint in all of phoenix. Great cheap prices. There are three types of mexican restaurant places i go. 1) I have to for some reason. 2) I want some mexican food and this place was around. and 3) I crave this place in particular.  This place falls into my number 3 category easily. I literally love the guy at the register, he was really friendly and knew his menu well. That is always a good thing when your workers actually know the menu (i think he might be the owner). It is a small place, outdoor seating if you wish and pretty clean considering the outside aesthetics.   The food:  Fish Tacos - Grade: A+, the fish was fresh and crunchy, the sauce was nice and tangy, the cabbage was crisp and fresh. The sauce and the lime were in perfect harmony.  Quesadilla -  Grade: A+crunchy corn tortilla, um for real, soo simple yet soo delicious, crunchy all the way through, generous amounts of cheese made each bite memorable  Tamales (spicy chicken) - Grade:  A, i wish the maiz was a little softer, but the texture was still good. I was hoping for the chicken to be spicier but i have a pallet for spicy pain... Even though it didn't get a plus it was still really good, just wasn't what i was expecting so a slight let down  Perro Oaxaca - Grade: A, the Oaxacan version of the Sonoran Hot Dog...still my votes go sonoran all the way through and through. This was REALLLY tasty still, but my only step fuss was, too much mayo on it, if it was SPICY mayo i wouldn't mind too much... My opinion for the mayo is, either do light mayo, or do a chipotle mayo and put that one top...that would be great.   Glad i have found a mexican food joint i love on my side of town. I'll be back in a week when i start to crave it again.

This place is pretty good. Prices seem a little high, but you get a good amount of food. I like the i think its called the "valley plate" or something like that. Its pancit, lumpia, and that purple rice. Good stuff 8 dollars.   If they happen to be at a place i am at i will stop by (like Glendale Glitters) or Wednesday farmers market downtown

Yes. B-day dinner...  It was good. All the sandwiches my table had were delicious. I went with my family so i got to try everyone's food  (thats how we roll). All the sandwiches had delicious and fresh ingredients. I got the porkwich, and that one would say doesn't sound too delicious but i was craving some pulled pork. The pulled pork + ham + sweet honey sauce/gravy they put ontop was so complimentary to each other. It was like going to a concert and hearing an awesome 3 part harmony on your tongue! Then the texture of the fresh coldslaw (which still had crunch) just was the high point.   Mac'n Cheese (MnC)...yess please! that was my side. It was baked...thats the way to go, had good texture with some crunch on top (yes i do like texture). The cheese didn't over power. It was a nice clean mac'n cheese, not sloppy and soaked with cheese. It was a good balance, and very light for being a MnC.  The backyard burger...get it..  the whitefish sandwich...get it.  brown bag chicken sandwich...get it..  Other chicken sandwich...get it..  Rueben....not as good as the others, BUT i loved how the meat was soo smokey that it makes up for it.... get it, but its not like that standard rueben you'd get from a deli, so just know that and don't go in with deli standards.   all in all. I love it and i'd come back..

Just signed up for this gym its 10 dollars a month, no pool or bball courts. But they have a lot of treadmills and ellipticals which are good so you will never have to wait.   Its been open for 6 months, the staff is very friendly and nice. David the manager told me about the place when it first opened. He is awesome and does a good job of keeping a good gym.  There aren't any meatheads there which is good so people like me wont be intimidated.. haha  very casual place to go work out just to stay in shape, not if you want to be mr. usa...or mrs...

This is a nice coffee shop, pretty calm here considering i been here all day and the biggest rush has been 4 people.   I got the iced coffee / toddy. To be honest the iced coffee was pretty good. Not diluted and not overpowering.  It is a very standard coffee shop layout. It has a good study layout, but the room sound travels too easily and if you are a study in the quiet type person it isn't going to work for you.  To address the price, it is about the same as other places, their prices include tax so that is always nice. You only need quarters when you go here. Very convenient  The staff is chill, definitely a nice place to come by if you live around here. (which i dont)  The only thing which is dumb is the parking time limits, but that is the city's fault.  Why doesn't this place get 5 stars you ask?  They really don't have anything to make this a unique destination, it is just plainly a coffee shop with out a specialty type drink they overly excel at.  I went in and asked if they had a specialty type drink they are known for...i was told the toddy with soy. Needless to say, it was good but didnt blow me away to be a specialty of theirs.   Nothing special, but a solid place to frequent if you are looking for a standard coffee drink.

I love PVBC.... Best burger in-town is easily the Brulee.  I was so hesitant when it came to ordering this. It sounds odd and scary, but it is mouth-gasmic.  They layer the burger so beautifully and hats off to making not only a mouth watering burger, but an appealing mouth watering burger.  The brulee activated all my tastebuds (except the sour and bitter). I had the sweet, the salty/savory, a smokey flavor from bacon, a delicious fried egg bursting all over the burger patty, Sweet onions...and wait..yes the SWEET SWEET and CRUNCHY brulee'd bun...  So i thought that was soo delicious then i spotted it...spiracha sauce...yes...I then decided to add this flavor to my burger...so imagine all that i mentioned before then a kick of hot spiciness. Low and behold i thought i knew what a mouth-gasm was before this time, but i truly mouth-gasm'ed from this burger.   My favorite burger place in town..YES it is true. PVBC has become that for me.  I've tried their other burgers since that fateful day, they are equally delicious, but not the mouth-gasmic powers of the brulee. I even tried the brulee with chicken breast...it was delicious and totally a different beast with that...but nothing compares to the orginal brulee burger...  sing with me: "it feels like the first time!!! it feels like the very first time"

Good pho. Fast service, friendly, and clean!!  Definitely would come back, but my favorite place is literally 2 more miles south, so not sure if i could fit the urge to go there instead.  I definitely would like to try their other food, but the pho was solid. (good broth).

Okay i intern next door and showed up real early to my meeting and was hungry so i decided to walk on over there and grab a bite.  WOW so worth it! the owners are sooo friendly and were talking to me about how everything is made fresh and "all natural, no msg". They also gave me horchata "rice water" which was a homemade recipe and amazingly delicious. I hate horchata normally but this one i could drink all day!   To be honest i am glad i stopped and finally found phoenix's good and authentic mexican food. (it isn't good if it isn't authentic).  oh yeah, i got the breakfast burro cause i was itching for some eggs this morning...i am pretty sure i found the place i want to try menudo at..  I am going to be back... A LOT

Staff is nice, but they don't really care to talk much.. It's not like it was busy (i was the only one there).   Anyways fries were made from the frozen/freezer bag kind. it was all mushy inside.  I could make a better burger at home on a george foreman. I will pass on this place...  they have the most unhealthiest menu ever too.. if you go twice in a lifetime you most likely will have at least 1 heart attack.  kudos on that part...

People dump their old cars here. One bronco has been parked very horribly and sitting in a guest spot for 3-4 months now.   If you don't get here at a good time there will be no guest spots open. Don't park outside the place unless you want your car broken into...  also lots of college students here who have parties...you do the math.

WOW.. to be honest WOW  I thought I had some good vegetarian food before, but this place owns it all.   Best Mock meat i have ever had! My fiancee got the mock chicken, (some noodle dish, i forget the name, but it was around the top of the menu), I got a tofu version of the spicy noodle bowl (whatever their name was i forget, i will know it if i see it)  Needless to say i really enjoyed each dish. I would love to try other things on their menu and I think...no i KNOW we will be back some time too.  Their coffee shop is freakn awesome, which is next door. I got a drink there, my fiancee got some vegan pastries after me telling her don't cause i never had a good one before.  Well i was wrong they were pretty good cookies...(though i don't like to mention it too often). the coffee was great too. It helps when you have friendly fun baristas working.   No snobs here. just people who love their jobs. (unless you are the jerk who comes i and tries to start something)

MMMMMMMMM GIMMIE THAT!!  This place is good! i got the Jerk Chicken.. and i was thinkn as i was eating this, yeah it could be spicier, but then i took a bite of a part that was filled with the spices/marinade, and yes. I was happy.  let me take it back to the beginning for you....  I was driving up 19th with full intention of coming to the Jerk Hut to get my grub on. I started to drive a little bit slower so i could spot the place. (its on the North east side).. I slip into the back where it says "parking entrance" (it also is the exit too so watch out!).   Well i look to my right and it looks kinda shady back there, but i think whatever i won't be in there too long. I park and start to walk around the front. I hear a voice come from one of the doors, you can just walk through the backs of the businesses. I notice it is coming from the far left side (the door for the jerk hut) and so i proceed to come over. The guy greets me with a thick accent and says, "you are going to the jerk hut? this is the door for the jerk hut"... I said yes with a big smile and proceed because i can definitely tell where the jerk hut is (follow your nose toucan sam).. I enter into a what i was expecting to be a little run down shop. Nope...super clean, everything is newly finished. I walk in and am greeted by the cashier/server...  I order my jerk chicken, she recommends different sides to go with my food...I obviously accept because who wouldn't take (who i think was a co-owner) advice. Well yes! i landed the Jerk chicken, fried plantains, the bean rice with gravy...MMMMMMMMM i want more and i just finished eating there. Needless to say, i should have asked for more gravy ontop of my rice cause that made it 100x's better... yes 100 times, i calculated it...  I get a jamaican soda to go with my meal...yes it all hit the spot. True story its a little pricey.  jerk chicken meal and soda ran me up to 13 dollars. (it was a specialty soda so that prolly helped out my total).  if you just get the meal (no drink) you will be around 10 dollars..but to be honest, just get the drink  Anyways if you don't like this place i have to say you must be a vegitarian....and to that i say...sucks for you cause this place's jerk chicken was bomb diggity no doubt...  Now here is the question people always want to know...Will you be back??   Yes i will be back...tomorrow actually so i can try the ox tail... that good twice in a week..maybe more if i got paid more .. #iwantaraise

Great food, good date night type place.  I wish i wrote this review earlier, my wife and I went here awhile ago and to be honest I don't remember much about the food besides the fact that we both got different sandwiches they had. It was a good amount of food, not to stuff you, but not to leave you wanting to order 5 more things to satisfy yourself.  I do remember we enjoyed going there and will definitely be back again.

I have been driving past this place on a weekly basis watching it slowly become reality. Every time i drove past it, i never could tell if it was open or just preparing to open soon. To be honest i was a little skeptical, considering it was sandwiched next to a mechanic/llanteria and was, lets face it in an odd place. I actually have only seen one person ever eating infront of the place. Hello red flag? nah. I love to go to these places. Well i showed up, to an empty parking lot and the worker saw me coming and gave me a friendly smile and wave. He was all full of smiles when i showed (i was thinking uh oh?? am i the first ever customer?). Well he hands me a menu, and we chat it up a little bit seeing how long they have been open (coming up on two months he says). Well I looked at the menu and it's short and to the point, but also friendly.   I ordered the Spicy Pico de Gallo burger, this is a 1/3 lb burger topped with swiss cheese, homemade pico, spicy jalapeno mayo, and (not on the menu) jalapenos (canned and cooked so not super spicy, i can taste what they are :P ). This burger was big! the pico was packed on there, the burger even though cooked on a grill still juicy and flavorful.  I loved the flavors i was getting from this burger. It wasn't the best burger i had ever had, but this is the you can have this burger every to every other day type. Not too much bun, not too much patti, not too much toppings. well proportioned. I appreciate someone who understands balance in cooking.  I ordered this with the fries and a drink. (drinks are canned, even though i saw a soda machine behind him, i think it was out of order or something). the fries were a little salty for me and heavily seasoned. Not saying they were bad, just not how i would have preferred. Next time i will probably ask to lightly season it if possible.   Wow when i got my food what a good portion of fries and big burger. I mean i was full. maybe too full at the end. The whole meal burger, fries, and drink ran me up to 5.50 pre tip.  so that means, burger $5 as marked, drink 25cents, and fries 25 cents. Sweet!!!!!!   The prices really aren't that bad considering its a 1/3 lb burger you are getting that is cooked upon your ordering. I would love to see this business grow and their burger selections start to as well..   They have other things like rice bowls, corndogs, chili dogs, grilled cheese, and pb&j...    All in all my reckless eating patterns/bravery in exploring uncharted destinations has proven to be fruitful again. I will try and frequent this place on my burger cravings.  According to the guy working, business is slower in the first two days and picks up at the end of the week and weekends. So keep that in mind if you have a big group going or anything like that.   I went at 12:15/30 and i was the only person there...and really taste wise ...shouldn't be the only one.   Um only complaint is the guys at the mechanics next door were loud and their air pressured drill for lug nuts was LOUD!!!!   this is their "website/facebook" https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rock-n-Roll-Patio/308825382495343?sk=info

Okay, so my rating is a 3.5, and typically I round down. But for this place i rounded up because they prepared the hashbrowns how i like it. Thin and crispy.  They had delicious benedict. I love their hollandaise they used. Definitely worked its way into my top 2 of favorite hollandaise.   I really hope to try some more dishes, here.

Went here because the sunday paper had a free appetizer.. I can see why it is free.  Typical type of bar. Food is Meh, drinks are...drinks. and the girls are scantily clad. If you like mainstream places like this go for it.   Not my cup of tea..

Put a bird on it!   This is in a little bit of a weird location/ only a tiny folding sign telling you whats in there. The building looks like its an empty art studio from the outside. Maybe cause it is one...go figure...hipsters and coffee...  well i was warmly welcomed upon entering the establishment. I love the the layout and aesthetics of the place. Scrabble tiles for the menu board. It's like a hipster dream come true. They have a small choice in latte flavors, because they are fairly new.   I would have rated them at 3 stars but guess what they had Thai Tea! score! To be honest it was perfect RIGHT from the pitcher, but thats the problem. Thai tea is not a pound it out drink, you take your time and drink and let the ice kind of melt into it. Well as soon as my ice started melting (its arizona so 45 seconds) it started to taste watery. Add a little bit more of some strength to it and it would be great. Obviously they are just starting out and getting the kinks all worked out so its nothing to go on a psycho rant and 1 star this place. Solid 4 easy. Has some very interesting drinks to try and ideas.

WE LOVE il Bosco.   cute little sit down restaurant. I would imagine little cafe's in europe to be like their place.  The pizza's here are amazing. My wife ordered the one (forget the name) but they said it was their best seller. Obviously know why because it was AMAZING. mine was good, but her pizza made mine taste like crap.   If you like olives they serve a small tray of it before your food. I am not  a big fan of olives so this wasn't a big deal to me. But my wife loved it!

so don't get me wrong the place is okay, but i mean i wouldn't travel so far for it  The place is very very spread out. It was standard chinese restaurant service, a little better actually because it was so empty we got most of the attention.   Anyways, the food just really didn't impress me, um good thing though it didn't ruin me 4 hours later...if you know what i mean....

I ate too much when i came here.  I AM NOT an indian food expert by any means. Just talking about this as food. I liked it. I went for the buffet (go early for buffets to get the food when it comes out fresh). The meat was nice and tender. Good food to just eat. No complaints except the fact i ate too much and wanted to die afterwards, but thats my own fault.  I would come back to this place. You should go and make an assessment for yourself..  one thing i have to say though, is that it is a horrible location.

Hey great place, very "cute". They have quite a few unique drinks on their menu which their barista made well. What prevented a 5 star in this case was all my flavoring was trapped at the bottom so my last sip was an exquisite surprise of explosive sugar all up in my grill. Considering i don't like sugar that much i almost gagged. BUT!! thats just how most drinks are. Wish he mixed it in a little better, but things settle. The top part was good, not too sweet and enough flavor to get from it what they are were going for (the mocha mandarin). Next time i will definitely ask for less flavoring because if that all was mixed into the drink evenly i might have not enjoyed it as much.  If i wanted to rate my full experience, it'd be grumpy to be honest. There was no parking that i could find (for free). So we parked at meters...yeah you guessed it. I got a ticket...so most expensive cup of coffee i've had. :( [do they have a parking lot nearby  for squash blossom? preferably a free one]  Aside from getting a ticket (MY FAULT! i should have put more change in the meter), i liked this place a lot. I want to come back for breakfast...after i max out the meter though...HA!

Not bad, good ambience for a brewery. It was relevant enough for guys to go grab some beers there and also for young families to come by.  I need to come here more /try more of their beers to give you my opinion.  They have some other beers on tap...orange shanty is nasty...but you all knew that already.  Go for their beers instead

Lots of beer to choose from here. I love the cycling selection, but it makes me a little sad because I usually don't get to try everything on the list. unless i want to be a raging drunk...which never happens.   I have not tried the food, but all the pictures look delicious.  Get there early if you want to have a group table to enjoy drinks. Otherwise suck it up and wait.

Went for our anniversary dinner. We didn't have a reservation, but we must have gone at the right time as we were seated immediately. Reading some other reviews and tips, this sounds pretty freakn rare.   Ended up getting the Aged Goats cheese plate, wild sea bass, duck bolognese, and brussel sprouts.  The aged goat cheese plate was really good. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but that whole element of the aged goat cheese was not overpowering. It was a perfect balance. Really enjoyed it, more than i thought i would (my wife prefers it thats why we ordered it). The sea bass itself was just okay, The skin could have been crispier, but the plate as a whole was delicious. There were so many elements on the plate, that when eaten together, it elevated the plate a lot. The kimchee they used on the plate was really tame for kimchee, but it had the perfect elements needed to enhance this sea bass. The duck was rich, I enjoyed it. I wish there was more duck in there, or larger chunks instead of shredded. It was my wife's plate, so the few bites I had I enjoyed, the creaminess of the marscapone, with the pasta really balanced out the richness of duck.  Brussel sprouts were well cooked, but a little heavy handed on the salt, for our preference.   The service was great, and they brought us out some champagne and a deconstructed cheesecake, which was a great way to end the meal.  We'd come back and definitely try something different on the menu, not necessarily cause we were unhappy, but because everything sounded delicious (and some other dishes at the tables around us looked tasty)

Zooks is delicious. They are soo friendly here and love to help you out with suggestions. I definitely recommend trying any of their top sellers (#25 is what i got).   The sandwiches are not huge, so if you are big eater...get a salad or another sandwich.   One wish I have for for Zooks is that the egg yoke would be runny instead.. That would be AWESOME!

Buy a growler and take it home...okay you got me.  I was wary when I ordered my chef's whim pizza. I thought it literally was going to be made on the fly and whatever he felt like. It's actually just a daily special pizza. No you don't get a unique pizza to you. Sadly...thats what i was hoping for.  Instead it was a very vegetarian sounding pizza. It had beets and corn in it..which scared me.  I have never eaten beets before...so i was kind of scared. I went through with my decision...mostly because my wife made it for me. Good thing because the pizza was delicious. Not sure what beets are supposed to taste like...i thought they would be red, they were yellow..and sweet tasting. Is that normal? not sure but the pizza was good.  Anyways...ended the night with my growler in hand...+1 for me.

I was just driving around looking for somewhere to eat and saw gadzooks. I remembered saving it to my bookmarks of places to try. Realistically I rarely ever get around to this list, so I had to take this opportunity to try it. First impressions upon walking in, it was loud (lots of people there) and I just assumed it was a cafeteria type line. I was right! Thankfully I was right. The menu is written up high. Take your time to go over it cause there are lots of choices.   The first guy was nice and could tell I was new to the establishment. He directed me on the process and what you can do for the enchiladas.   I love the 50/50 tortillas. They are a little thicker and are in between a tortilla and pita in density. I thought it was perfect. I heard you could mix the fillings too but I just stayed pretty standard. I got the braised short rib and green chili pork. The pork was moist and tender. Short rib was tender but a little dry. Their guacamole is okay, habanero salsa is good, the heat doesn't kick you right away. Wouldn't say it is unbearable either (especially for being habanero).   All in all go down the line and get what you think sounds and looks good. I wish I had a chance to try everything. Next time I plan on getting the works done to my enchiladas and a necessary fried egg ontop. I'm sad I didn't get one this time. Pretty sure I will be here later this week.

The shaved ice is unique and good.  The ambiance and service lacking...Would i come back? no...not even if i was craving it because service SUCKS...  Rude wanna be's here.    I'd give 1 star but that wouldn't be fair to the shaved ice.

Just got remodeled not too long ago. Had a groupon (of course who doesn't now -a-days)  Well anyways, Pho here is good, good noodle to meat ratio, (which you would be surprised isn't all about the meat for me). The "Large" didn't seem to be that big of a bowl, but the amount of food inside was definitely a large portion.  The spring roll was good, the wrap was not dried out anywhere , peanut sauce was well balanced, nothing overboard.   This is a great alternative to going down south to Tempe/Chandler area.

MMMM delicious.  Had the 10oz Lamb burger. I love how it wasn't purely ground, but more like pulled lamb? Not sure if that is how lamb comes out when it is ground or if it really was. Anyways this burger was amazing. Perfectly Juicy, meat to bun, perfect. cheese to meat perfect. Fries...thats what stopped a five star. They were good, but couldn't line up to the rest of the food we had. (a little bit of a let down)  My wife had the beef shoulder. It was served in its own pan. We loved the aesthetic that  added to our dining experience. The servers were knowledgeable and had the perfect balance of visiting your table and letting you eat.  I will come back to salty sow for SURE!

It's good. Definitely is in my top 5 of sushi places here in Phoenix.  Happy hour all day, i am pretty sure just counts as regular price, so they should take their sign down that says that.  Prices are good, services is prompt. This place is more about the rolls and quantity, which I have no qualms with.  My brother in law got this very interesting salad thing with tuna...It looked soo good, and he said it was too...sorry don't know the name of it.

A little pricey.  I got this one dish wish is canadian. I forget its name, but it was fries with sauce and cheese melted all up on it. (in short) with some other fixings too.  It was good, a little pricey (like i said earlier). The beers though...i know that is what we all care about. They are pretty good. It is nice to have a brewery in this location, and they are doing well.   I definitely would recommend getting their flight to try out the beers. figure out which you like the best. Their darker beers are good. from the browns to the porters.   Wasnt a big fan of their pilsner and other light beers.

It wasn't like the sonoran hotdogs down in tucson that I have had. But this was a pretty good one for what I've had up here in phoenix.  A little pricey for a sonoran hot dog.  Just incase you want to comment on how i said it was pricey, read it in the context first... FOR A SONORAN HOT DOG.

HAHAHA,  the place is exactly what i thought. I wanted to try this because hey...i want to give all new places a shot before passing judgement.  When we went in no one sat us down for 5 minutes, but it was completely empty...finally a hostess came sat us down and then didn't bring us any menus...I was fed up so i got up and grabbed menus myself from the hostess stand.  Just by looking at the place i knew it wasn't going to be good. The salmon was warm slimmy and rubbery...yeah three traits your "fresh" seafood should never be..guess what happened 4 hours later...I will spare you the details and let your imagine play.  Anyways, pretty typical poor quality sushi place, with inflated prices. They don't even use real crab for their quality roles.   Whatever gets the suckers to come in and spend money thats fine..  won't be back...second chance has been revoked for this place

This place wasnt that bad. The balance/proportions of meat to bread to veggies to tzitziki sauce was off. There seemed to be a lot of sauce frontloaded on this, and not so much for the rest. (im sure you could ask for this to be easily fixed). A lot of meat and barely and veggies. So those who want literally all gyro meat this is a good stop.   I wasn't upset with the proportion at all. It still was good fresh gyro meat. If it was dry and bland i wouldn't be happy. Overall this place is a 4. It just wasn't at blow me away proportions. It was a solid gyro. Definitely go if you are craving a good gyro.

I got the pork belly sandwich. It was cooked well. it was tender, but had no flavor. Really bland. That was only one sandwich, maybe they can do better, but for now they are sitting at a 2. What also kept them down was the server had no clue about anything on the menu. More education for the servers about the food would be better.

I didn't know they moved, but I passed their new location and thought, "oh another balkan bakery".   I showed up the following week and saw the friendly face of one of the workers (i think he may be the owner) and got a (i forget it's name), filo dough stuffed with spinach and feta cheese. It's delicious. That is one of the only things I really get here. Sometimes i get the kisra which is a small boomerang shaped salty bread.   Really well priced and freshly baked, and obviously delicious bread.  Come back? yes i do often.

Food takes quite a while to come out :\   small small portions for a bbq place and quite pricey. The similar place i have been to definitely crush this place in taste and quantity.  If you are craving bbq and don't want to go to a sit down place and you are in the area, sure why not. Support the mom and pops. But it isn't a first on my list.

I love the options they had here, they don't skimp you on noodles or meat. I got one of the special pho's and it was amazing. I kept pulling out different meats all the time. I am really glad there is a pho place like this around me and I don't have to travel down to tempe/mesa anymore.   Sandwich is good, the bread to toppings ratio could be better (less bread would be good).  Didn't try and spring rolls when i was there, next time i will.  Also they have hilarious shirts.

Love rita's. I prefer getting the misto which is all mixed together instead of the custard ontop of the ice.  That's just my personal opinion, but sometimes one could go with the original and pre-mix it...I just always want more custard...   you can't beat the original custard flavor. I am not too big of a fan of other ones.

I love hopdoddy,  went here a bunch when it first opened and tried almost all the burgers.  Definitely don't have any qualms about any burgers.  Be smart if you are unsure about something just ask for it on the side so you can control the amount you have. Definitely do this for the wasabi honey sauce on the ahi burger.   I highly recommend this place. The truffles fries aren't that amazing to get, try one of the others instead.

This was fun to go too, definitely ended up spending a lot of money to try out lots of food trucks I haven't been to before.  They have live music and places to sit. Its a fun night out with a group of friends. Especially if you can't decide where to eat, everyone gets what they want.

I am in a dilemma, I like the coffee, but the service and friendliness really puts them up there. The coffee/espresso/ice toddy are all amazing and very very consistent. Consistency is one of the most important traits of a coffee house you go to. If drinks are made differently all the time you don't know what you are walking into and what to ask for and how to customize it to your perfect specifications.  I enjoy this place because i have gotten the same few drinks here and it is always the same tasting. YAY for coffee conistency. One thing that is good that getting a dirty chai, the dirtiness comes free (or thats what the one barista told me) maybe he likes my smile thats why, but hey I LOVE getting an extra shot, or two in my drink.  I have not tried their yogurt, i still wonder if it is any good.   Good thing about this coffee house if you go to study/do work don't worry about the noise level or distractions. It has decent amount of foot traffic for their business, but not too much where you are too distracted. music could be turned down a little bit. Baristas mind their own business, but if you want to talk they are more than happy to talk with you. Which to be honest is a great trait to have.   They are super friendly.. Would be back more often if it was closer. Too bad i didn't know about them when i worked down there.

They had ran out of most things by the time we showed up here. I got the chicken shawarma special. It was really good. I can't wait to come back to this place and try their lamb/beef mix.  I give only 4 stars because they were out of everything. Hopefully i will be able to update this to 5 :)

The place is small, but clean. Thats always a good way to start, right?  So I went on a "busy day". The lady who took my order said, "we are not normally like this [refering to the business]". I was 5 orders back, and it took about 20-30 minutes to get my food, which was to go. I didn't feel that the time was extraneous, the food tasted as I expected of hawaiian type food.  I ordered the curry Katsu, with cheese? the cheese, was odd, but surprisingly worked. I never had melted cheese on top of katsu. The katsu itself was not greasy, and was not fried too long, which would leave it with a burnt taste. I typically like my curry thicker, but it was still good. Make sure you get it on the side when you order. I asked for it that way. Not sure if they typically do that or not. I was just thinking the breading would be soggy if I didn't....  Overall I'd rate the curry katsu on the average range. It definitely meets my craving.  Also ordered a spam musubi. The seaweed wrapping it was so small. and it was odd that they used seaweed rice seasoning on it... I like all that stuff, just typically I don't put it on a musubi. Anyways...this last part is all preference. I don't think i'd get a musubi here again, just cause I like it a different way.

Upon walking in this place had a new building feel. Everything in here is new and nice. Staff is friendly, talkative but not overly. Which is a good thing. They are definitely still working out the kinks. One qualm for an antsy person, they only have one register so if a phone order comes in then it backs up. To be honest I don't care because they will most likely get that fixed real quick (hopefully anyways). I have been waiting for this place to open, not necessarily for any reason aside from it being a new place close by to try. I am checking out the dishes people have around me and they look okay. If you look at the online menu it is not the same as in store, no wings but I hope soon they will. I will be more than happy to rank that.   The place is clean (as expected for being 3 days old) and the volume isn't loud. They have a baby sleeping in the back. Awww.  Haha.  The lighting is good so you older crowd no need to bring your own flashlight.   It was a little confusing coming in. I wasn't sure if I was to sit down or order up front. I just waited up front and that seemed like the way to go. An "order here" sign would be awesome. Definitely seems/looks like a family owned place. There is limited seating so if they get popular be prepared for a wait, or order out.   I ordered the PPC signature six piece, as recommended by the cashier. It is a square "crunchy"  pizza. Crust is between an average and thin crust (in thickness).  Takes around 20-25 minutes to come out. Crust is very crisp. It comes standard as just cheese. I assumed signature meant signature toppings too. Ask questions before ordering.   I loved how the crust was crunchy and the dough was soft (not under cooked) in the middle. The pizza was not oily like you would assume a small place like this would have. Napkin to oil value per piece, maybe like 1/3 to half a Napkin needed to absorb oil. Minimal oil on my hands after holding the pizza. The sauce was standard. They did a little bit to it to set them apart from the chains but nothing to call home about.   Dough to sauce to cheese ratio is perfect for this pizza. Definitely a great family night pizza and affordable/reasonably priced.   Would love to bump them to a 5 but I need to try other things before I do that.

I came back to check out the pizza again.  Like i said in my previous review the sauce still leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe seasoning it up a little more or adding something else in there? (garlic?)  Anyways, it was really nice to see that they have been working on their menu and beefing it up since the last time. They have visuals for you on what type of pizza to order. I like that. Nice small and easy fixes that makes me able to leave this at a 4 star.  I love this place IN COMPARISON to pizza hut and dominos. I would put them in this pizza circuit and rating system. Their prices are fair, and I would definitely frequent this place if I had children who wanted pizza. Its a healthier less greasy choice than the aforementioned pizza places.The 4 stars is the experience and overall pizza.   This would not make my list for sitdown gourmet pizza places. I don't think that is their intended market to compete with those pizza places. I think they intend to go against the "fastfood pizza".

came here on a date night with my wife. Great place and atmosphere for that. It was a little cold when we went(spring), but they have heaters on the patio. Hopefully they have misters too for now. We sat a high top, which is fine, it was a communale high top, so if you want your privacy make sure to request a regular table not a high top. The bruschetta was good, but skimpy, we were expecting something like postino's bruschetta board. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, just not the quantity we expected. We ended up getting two pizzas as well. I got the spicy pizza they had on their menu. I don't remember the name, but it was soo good. They had thinly sliced (vertically sliced) peppers on it which gave it a good heat. Not overwhelming at all (but so you know I LOVE spicy food, so if you don't you probably wont like the pizza).  I don't remember what my wife's pizza was because we both agreed mine was SOO good.

I've heard about Ike's and my family from SF raved about it. Yeah..they hyped it up too much for me. The crunch bread thing was good. It wasn't to die for or worth swearing by. There are a lot of sandwiches to choose from on their menu and online. It's cool they will make a sandwich from any other Ike's store in country.  This would have received 3 stars but they gave us a lot of samples of their sandiwches, so here is another for giving me more food... (yeah, i am easily pleased)

I've been to Topgolf about 3 times now. I love going it is so much fun. Just being able to go with your friends and play a game at a "driving range" is fun. I love finding an excuse to go.  Yes I am raving about this place and only give it 4 stars. It's cause service is slow. If you don't order drinks right away, don't expect to see your server or any drinks for 10 minutes. Considering that people are paying by the hour 10 minutes is 15% of your time (if you are there for an hour). I usually go in the middle of the day, so I don't think its too crowded eithere to where this can be warranted.   You don't really notice that when its your turn to hit, but if you are sitting there waiting for your turn, its nice to have a drink in hand.

I have no complaints. Rarely have to wait for a machine. Brand new facility so it's clean, that's how I hope it will stay. No real meat heads here. It is close to a high school. Thankfully there isn't a huge amount from there. I would say  .5 percent are kids. 75% are the average Joes trying to get fit.  The last 24.5% (yes I know my math) are those in shape and trying to stay in shape. The a/c is weak in certain parts which makes it muggy sometimes. Other places it's pumping out.   Staff says hi at the door like they are paid. Not much more, they don't try to upset anything they got going on. If I hadn't been a member at another gym before I'd be confused by a few things.   Stretching area is small and cluttered. Not sure if there is a remedy for that.   It's close to where I live and convenient times to work out. That's all that really matters in a gym. Don't complain about prices or cancellation fees, those are just your excuse as to why you aren't in shape.   It's also next to a delicious gyro place if you want to "cheat"  haaa

This place gets busy, but so does their other location. What really makes me sad about this place is....they don't have the beers from the brewery...SOOOO SOOOO sad. The food seems a little better up here. My wife prefers this location and I prefer the brewery.  Always love the decorations at OHSO, can't go wrong with bicycles.

Yeah. I love how close this is to where I live.   Okay i went there and asked what's the top thing on your menu... I was already eyeballing the sandwich.  He said really it is all good (typical answer), but it all revolves around the fish and fries  So there was my order a two piece fish and fries and a sandwich. Okay first off sandwich, it was good a little heavy handed on the tarter but next time I know to ask for only a little or just on the side. I wish the pickle was more crisp it would have added that texture to it (good thing I took it home and put on some home pickled pickles, that made it a homerun).  Okay anyways the fish was great, wasn't overly battered, very nicely seasoned. When you picked it up there was an oil residue but the amount you would expect. I really liked the fish, the texture from the fry, not over or under cooked, and pretty good portioned pieces considering size of servings.   The fries left me wanting but I think their other fries options would make up for it.  The fries are not bad it's just that the fish was at such a high caliber the fries were simply overshadowed.  Can't wait to go back and get the tacos!

I need to try other things here as well, but their Classic Banh Mi was good. The bread was great, not too hard. The Pate was delicious, it's been awhile since i've had some good pate on a bahn mi. It actually brought me back to my days in seattle....but i won't start to compare that sandwich to this anyfurther. I feel like they could have been a little more generous in the construction/ingredients of the bahn mi...I mean overall though it was good. Glad to have a good bahn mi place close to my side of town. I hope to try more things on the menu soon.
