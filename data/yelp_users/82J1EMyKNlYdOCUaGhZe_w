Had  the chili cheeseburger.  The food was very good and we were there on a Sunday brunch day.  Music was unbearably loud.  Service was brutal,   However, let me repeat ,The food was really good.  If you don't like improvisational jazz or yelling at your guest so they can hear you, don't go here on Sunday during the brunch hours.  Seem like a great wine bar and a very cool atmosphere.

Just get the Cubano - it is the best I have ever had.  This $5.50 sandwich is worth all of $12.00 and so good....it's also huge!!!

This place is a disaster for drinks.  The music is that loungy music you would never listen to on your own-  Not techno, just bad loungy music there-  Hate that kind of music.    If you get a Margarita, its tough to get more than two sips of your own drink.  They use so much ice,  No kidding,   I could drink the margarita in 30 seconds or less.  Everything is pre-made for the most part and there is so little liquor used you feel you are paying for Margarita flavored Kool-Aid for $8.00 at a time.    They can't screw up a shot of a Tequila and there is a large(and expensive) selection.  I am not a cheap guy, but hate being ripped off.  I hope this review kicks them in the butt a little bit.  I did not try the food but I went to Modern Margarita to have of  course;  a Margarita.   I will be skipping this place in the future.  A good place to meet in front of and then go somewhere else.

You can skip this place. It's another chain with what they would call fresh food I would call it prepared food in a set menu. There's no creativity the chicken sandwich was 1/10th the thickness of the bread I could barely find the chicken. My buddy had the Spasagna and it was cold in the middle and the noodles were all mashed together. this place is just not good. Cool from the outside, not good on the inside. People who like this place have very low standards in my opinion.

Good band on Friday & Saturday but no draft beer and they were out of Tito's Vodka.. Weird.  They have only had two years to order the draft beer. They must not be able to get it. That's the only obvious conclusion or did not pay an old bill at the pervious location.
