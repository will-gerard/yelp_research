This a friendly neighborhood bar offering great happy hours and live entertainment several nights of the week plus an excellent Sunday brunch.  Be sure to check out the Freaky Fridays shows featuring Celia Putty each Friday night.

This is my favorite Thai food restaurant in my neighborhood because their food is consistently delicious.  Their prices are reasonable.  This mom and pop place is cozy and simple.  It is great for dinning in or take out.

Zipps is my favorite sports bar and grill in town.  Food, drinks and service are great!  Happy hour specials offer reduced prices on some menu items.  Ambience of this location is warm and inviting.  I especially love their medium golden wings and cookie skillets.  It is a great place to meet friends and watch games on many large TV monitors.

I love this place. Their made to order noodle dishes are delicious and have spoiled me. Yes, I recommend dining here and yes I will definitely return again and again.

This deli is only mediocre. Their menu prices seem a little too high for the quality of food and service. I doubt if I will return.
