I wanted to like this place, but honestly only because of the sushi chef Ramon, who was flirting with me while I was dining solo after work and even tried to give me free food (cooked salmon ribs). Unfortunately, I got puking sick immediately after leaving this place and considering I only had 2 drinks and I'm not a lightweight, I can only blame the sushi. I suppose I should have known something was up when the yellowtail didn't have that signature taste I love so much and the salmon seemed to have a filmy texture but as I said, Ramon made me want to like this place. The portions were huge but in addition to my horrible aftermath, I found the selection of fish and rolls to be limited (no bluefin toro or shiro maguro) and my waitress was very inattentive.  I'm sorry Ramon but I will not be coming back to see you.

Brace yourself. This is a sad story.  I had a 2 year old husky named Kiba. Kiba developed coughing and sneezing the same time my other dog did. I gave him Benadryl and the symptoms seemed to be going away except for the lack of appetite, which was not uncommon for him to be finicky. I never had any idea his liver was failing. His brain apparently swelled and he started acting sick while I was at work so my parents met me here with him. It was too late for him though and he died within an hour of being brought here.  I don't blame them for the death of my dog but I do not appreciate their lack of compassion in handling a grieving pet owner.  Positives: They were very clinical and helped me understand what was happening to my dog so I could make the best choices for him. The vet tech was very professional in my interactions with him  Negatives: The vet, while very clinical, had horrible bedside manner. She talked in a way that me feel like she was blaming me for not knowing my dog was as sick as he was. Additionally, the receptionist had no concept on how to be sensitive to a horrible situation. After she knew my dog had passed and seen how tragic it was for me, she called "Have a good night" after us when we left, which feels completely inappropriate and is only one example of her inability to approach a grieving family with any semblance of empathy. Additionally, I received a note in the mail a few days later that was signed by the staff of the entire clinic in a manner reminiscent of birthday cards that go around in the office. This upset me more as it felt inappropriate and lacking in any real sympathy.  They may be able to provide emergency vet services in a competent way but their emotional intelligence is severely lacking.

This recently became my favorite Italian restaurant ever for so many more reasons than the food.   We walked in and were greeted by who I can only assume is the owner (an older Italian gentleman wearing a Yankees jersey) and seated in a booth. Frank Sinatra was singing and we were surrounded by pictures of past and present Yankees players (The Yankees are my AL team because I have a need to be severely anti-Red Sox).   Our waiter, Brandon/Meatball, was super friendly and never let my water glass get anywhere near empty. I love that.   So now on to the food, which was absolutely amazing... My mouth still waters just thinking about it. Our app of choice, garlic bread, was some of the best ever. I had the Chilean Sea Bass special - the fish  was cooked perfectly (and I'm not usually a fan of cooked fish) and the spinach ravioli it was on top of was amazingly delicious.   The only way this night could have gotten better is if I had been with a date who was drinking so that I could have drank as well. A nice white wine would have complimented the fish wonderfully.  As we were leaving, Steppenwolf started playing. How can any experience associated with a "Magic Carpet Ride" not get 5 stars?

This is my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time... Good, tasty food, full bar with great cocktails (big, intact mint leaves in their mojitos) and great atmosphere. I've been frequenting both the restaurant and the taqueria for years and it's one of the reasons that I think it's good to be back in the 480.  However, I was semi-disappointed last night when my friend Jarrod and I went to the restaurant for dinner and when he asked for hot sauce on the side and we informed that it would be an extra $1.00. Seriously? Extra charges for hot sauce at a Mexican restaurant? I mean, that's like a bar charging for water...  When you go here, I highly suggest the green sauce. Whether it be as the salsa on your chips or the enchilada sauce, it is absolutely fantastic. Also a big fan of the shrimp tacos with their pineapple salsa - om nom nom.  Glad to be back where there is plenty of good Mexican food to eat rather than in SF where the best Mexican is in burrito form (no offense to SF burritos but there's more to Mexican cuisine than that - SF still rocks the house in weather and culture though).

I love this hotel! Being away from noisy casino but still having close access to it is a major plus. Add the convenience of having an actual kitchen plus a wonderful bed with plushy pillows and a huge jacuzzi bath tub and you've made a friend for life. In Vegas, you really need a refrigerator to store your own beer and liquor, not a minibar with the overpriced mini versions, which this place provides without needing to be victim to a timeshare scheme. I'm an MLife member (the MGM frequent players club) so the more I stay and play, the more I get for free.  I know this sounds like a paid advertisement but I just really enjoyed my stay this time and can't wait to come back! I will stay here every time!

I give it one star and Yelp says "Eek! Methinks not." and that feels like the perfect summary for my experience at this so-called spa.  I ended up here because of Groupon Now I decided to take advantage of while I was in Vegas. It felt weird when I walked in the door but I figured that I already paid for it, I might as well go through with it. Big mistake...  I went in thinking I was going to get some sort of new age detox themed pedicure. I left after an awkward short Marshall Applewhite (of the Heaven's Gate cult) rubbed my feet with hand sanitizer.  Props to GroupOn for giving me a refund after I told them what happened and how skeezed out I was.

Vince was super hot and forced our reluctant bride to interact with him. Only complaint: he should have revealed his thong!
