Great find thanks to Yelp! My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.  It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains.   I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll.   Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world.   We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit.   Next time we go back I'll definitely try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good and probably tastes really fresh.

I guess the recession hit this shopping center pretty hard, which is shocking since it's right across the street from the Biltmore. The shops and movie theater are kind of behind everything, so there's not a lot of exposure and whatnot. Plus, the parking structure is a pain in the ass. I personally wouldn't shop here because parking is such a pain.   Anyway, I went to see a movie here at the AMC, which looked nice. In walking through the shops, I couldn't believe how many "For Lease" signs there were. Kind of sad to see. Anyway, I made my way to the movie theater, which is upstairs. There's a nice escalator to take you up, except it was broken. Ugh! I'm guessing either they shut it down at a certain time to save money or they don't have enough money to fix it. It wouldn't have been so bad except it just had rained and it was still 95º outside, so hiking up those metal stairs was not fun.

So I normally like this place but something annoying happened today. On their menu they have a "vegan coconut and almond bar" and it has been on the menu for as long as I can remember. When I went to order it I was told that it was not vegan. I asked the cashier and she seemed more interested in helping the people behind me than answering my question. I don't think they know what they're doing and aren't familiar with their own menu. Kind of annoying.

I bought a groupon for this as $14.99 for three days of parking isn't a bad price. Upon pulling up to the lot, I can see why the parking is inexpensive. I was a little uneasy about leaving my car here as it didn't really seem that secure. I mean, someone could easily just walk right in and vandalize your car. I guess I'd rather pay a little bit more for peace of mind.   Anyway, upon arriving back to my car from my trip, I encountered a very unprofessional driver. He asked what row I was parked in, which I responded "2." Upon arriving back to the lot he told me to just holler when I saw my car. When I saw it I said three times very loudly that I saw my car. He wound up driving past it and dropping off another family that was on the shuttle with me. He then asked me where my car was and I told him that we passed it. He then decided to lecture me about speaking up. I didn't appreciate that since I spoke up three times. Maybe someone should lecture him about listening.   Next time I take a trip I'm going to try the Blue Sky airport parking. It's a little further away but looks way nicer and more secure.

Ok, ok....perhaps my first review was a little harsh. I should not have taken a star away because their security didn't seem secure. My car, after all, was not broken into and I have, since writing this review, reviewed some police reports to see if this place has an unusually high theft rate...and it doesn't.   Upon writing this review, management from this company contacted me, which I really appreciate. It shows that they care about their business and care about their reviews on Yelp and what their customers have to say. It also shows that my business is valued and I truly appreciate that.   I am willing to give this business another try next time I travel out of town.

Ya know...this place has a reputation of being ghetto but honestly, I don't know why. I attended this place during a Fry's appreciation event and I must say, it was tons of fun! The "castle" which houses the arcade looks a little dated but they have a bunch of games upstairs that you can't really find anywhere else. They also have air hockey and tons of games that spew out tickets.   As far as rides go, there's the big roller coaster which is a little small but still a lot of fun. They also have a log ride, a kiddie coaster, a tower that drops you about 10 stories, put put golf, a zip line, go carts, bumper cars, bumper boats, a swinging pirate ship, and many other rides for kids.   I wish they would tear town metro center mall and expand the park out to incorporate more roller coasters and fun rides.   The employees were all super nice too...and very outgoing.

Probably the best chiropractor in the entire state of Arizona. Dr. Boardman is awesome! He's knowledgeable, witty, funny, and an absolute joy to deal with. Dr. Boardman really knows his stuff and will take the time to explain everything to you and answer any questions you may have. His service is not too costly either.   Usually there is a massage therapist on staff so it's a one stop shop for all your chiropractic needs.

I have eaten here the past 3 nights in a row! My friend and I visited this location on Friday as they have a vegan pizza. I ordered that and a small house salad with their house dressing. The salad was extremely fresh and their house dressing was a mixture of balsamic vinegar with olive oil and herbs...it's really good. The vegan pizza is a traditional pizza with Daiya vegan cheese instead of dairy cheese. Typically it has a reputation for being a little bland. NYPD did a decent job of making sure the pizza was flavorful.   The location delivers and offers online ordering. The delivery fee is $3.00 and they deliver as far north as baseline

Avoid this place! Their registers are horribly understaffed while employees just stand around and laugh. I'm posting this review on 12/15, the heart of the holiday shopping season and have been waiting in line for 30 minutes. They only have 2 registers open with a bunch of employees standing around. Annoying!!

A week before Christmas and they have 1 cashier working? What the heck? This location is consistently under staffed and looks like a bomb went off. While I was in line the manager came to the front of the store and said, "OMG, I have no cashiers!" and walked off. I feel like the employees just stand around and don't do anything. It's pretty frustrating when you're waiting in line for 30-35 min to buy one item and you see two people just standing there.

Still one star due to inefficient staff and long wait times. The line was snaked around the store and they only had 2 cashiers. They clearly don't care about customers.

Ugh, what a terrible experience!  Ok, so for starters, the pricing on their website is extremely misleading and I feel it's done purposefully to get people in so they can bait and switch. I went to the website to look for a coupon to get an oil change. I normally go to the Cobblestone Auto Spa on Alma School and Germann in Chandler but thought they were somewhat overpriced so I wanted to check elsewhere. I went to their website and saw a coupon for $5.00 off "upgraded" oil which was regularly $54.99. Sounds great, right? Well the key word there is upgraded. I assumed upgraded meant synthetic and was expecting to pay $49.99 for a synthetic oil change. Well, turns out they were crafty with their working because upgraded didn't mean synthetic. When I got there the price jumped $20.00 to $74.99 for a synthetic oil change and it turns out that the $54.99 was for a synthetic blend (which is usually half conventional and half synthetic). This is ridiculously overpriced because I could have gone to AAMCO and gotten the same type of oil for $21.99. I should have went to Cobblestone because the pricing on their website is very straightforward: "This much for conventional, this much for a blend, and this much for full synthetic." It turns out that Cobblestone's price was $67.99 for full synthetic with $5.00 off and a free full service car wash, which they usually bump up to the next level for free, based on my experience.  Here's where things got interesting. When I mentioned this to the tech doing my oil change he basically said in so many words, "Well I haven't dropped your car yet, so if you want to leave it's fine." Really dude? You're going to turn away business? The whole reason I went there was because I thought I was going to get an oil change for $49.99 and he wouldn't work with me at all. Even if he was like, "Let me see what I can do" and then came back and said, "there's nothing I can do" I would have been fine with that.   The car wash they gave me (the standard) was terrible. I wasn't too pissed about this though because it's monsoon season and it's going to just get rained on. I found it particularly funny when the agent tried to get me to detail the car. Ummm...it's monsoon season and t'storms were in the forecast for that afternoon. They try to sell you on a 5-day guarantee...because I have time for that.  This business is obviously hurting. I noticed a lot of the retail space has been emptied and most of the employees were sitting around. When I arrived they couldn't find the oil change guy...probably because he had no work all day.   I do not recommend this business and I will not be back. I'll stick to Cobblestone Auto Spa. I do not like deceptive businesses one bit.

Really really good Mexican/Tex Mex food! If you're a vegetarian like me, I recommend the veggie fajitas...they come with plenty of vegetables and DELICIOUS tortillas. They also come with a cilantro lime rice that is nothing short of amazing. The first time we went here McKenzie was our server and she was awesome. She knew the menu, knew what a vegan was, and provided us with prompt, efficient service. The second time I went here the server (don't remember his name) was just ok. He didn't seem too knowledgeable with the menu and had to check on several items.   I'll definitely be back though as the veggie fajitas are really tasty!

I'll never shop here again!   On Wednesday January 20 I visited this location and bought 4 men's polo shirts, which cost about $130. Before I purchased them I explained to the cashier that I had a $25 off $100 or more coupon at home. She said it would be no problem and all I had to do was bring my receipt back with the coupon.   On Sunday January 24 I went back with my receipt and coupon and went up to the register. The associate explained to me that they needed the merchandise too. That didn't make sense since I'm not returning the items, I'm just asking them to adjust it. I asked if I could just go pull items off the floor and do it that way. She asked a manager who said no. I asked why and the associate asked the manger to come to the register.   All the manager said was that it was their policy. There was no other reason than it being the policy. I asked where this policy was and she just kept repeating it was policy. How stupid. She couldn't come up with a reason other than policy. I asked if it made sense to her and I got the same answer. She said I could call customer care to see if they'd do it...they're closed on the weekends.   So, I went home to get the polos and I was going to return them all and they'll lose a customer who spends a lot of money there over $25. It's sad that they'd rather refund $130 then make an exception and credit me $25. Anyway, I went home, grabbed the bag and went back to the mall only to find that they closed 5 minutes early.   I emailed their customer care department and we'll see what they do about it. Horrible horrible customer service! I can't wait to go in on Monday and get all my money back.

Not a fan of this location. The equipment is very crammed as this is a smaller location and it is also quite old.   The elliptical I was on was made by Precor and looked like something straight out of the 70s. I hope they refresh this gym with new equipment or move to a larger location.

I was a little wary about going here because of the negative reviews but every time I drive by this place it's always busy, so it can't be THAT bad, right?   I initially went in to get a transmission flush. The service is very well priced at $119.99, which is over $100 cheaper than Jiffy Lube...plus they had the car done in less than 20 minutes. The staff inside the oil and lube area was very nice and professional. I was very pleased with this service. I had a similar experience when I brought my car in for an oil change and power steering fluid change. They were professional and took the time to show me that certain things needed to be done.   When I got my transmission done I went ahead and added a diamond touch wash because my car was disgustingly filthy. They actually did a very good job in a reasonable amount of time, I must say. There were a few missed spots in the interior and I wish they did a better job cleaning the navigation screen but overall I'm really pleased.   I'm happy they did a good job because this place is literally like 1.5 miles from my house.   The location also sells shell gasoline but I don't recommend getting it here because it's overpriced. If you want shell gas, go 1 block east and fill up at the Arizona Ave & Germann location. It's a good 20-30¢ cheaper usually.

I was pleasantly pleased with the staff here. They're way better than Just Brakes! I brought my car here because whenever I stepped on the brakes my steering wheel would shake like a British Nanny. I figured I would need new rotors since it has been about 4 or 5 years since I had them replaced. Anyway, I brought it here at 3pm on a Friday not expecting them to be able to do repairs...but I figured they could at least point me in the right direction.   The gentleman at the front greeted me and welcomed me to Brake Masters as it was my first time there. I explained what was going on and he told me he'd have a technician look and call me with what was wrong.   30 min later they called and explained that my rotors were warped. He said he measured them and they were able to machine them and that my total cost out the door would be $123 and some change.   Two things.....  1. I greatly appreciated the honesty. I went in there thinking I needed new rotors. They could have VERY easily sold me new rotors to get more $$$ but they didn't. They were honest and did what needed to be done.   2. I liked the "out the door" pricing. That set a proper expectation for me and made it so there were no surprises.   Is $123 expensive for machining rotors? I don't know nor do I care because of the great service I received. I also appreciated that they were able to inspect my vehicle AND do the repairs without an appointment and only 2 1/2 hours before they closed.

This store always looks like a bomb went off. Every time I visit this location it is unorganized, messy, and it smells weird. The messiness makes it very difficult to find things, which can be really frustrating.

This store sucks! They have been out of sting and linger BBQ sauce for like 3-4 weeks and whenever I ask when they'll get It in no one knows.  The organization of his store makes no sense and it's hard to find things.   Employees seem to be a little clueless where things are and work at a snails pace. The AJs on Thompson Peak Pkwy is way better. At least they have things in stock!

I have definitely experienced better! Let's see, so I first brought my car here to get the brakes done and they did a pretty good job, although, every time I'm in reverse, my brakes do make a squeaking noise. Not sure what's up with that. Anyway, needless to say, they did a pretty good job on my brakes.   Since my last brake job, they have switched managers and the service has kinda gone down hill. I brought my car in to have the control arm bushings done. They quoted me a little under $500 to have this done, which wasn't really that much cheaper than the dealer. The dealer was about $50 more and would have given me a loaner vehicle to use.   Anyway, I brought my car in to have them work on it. I dropped it off at 12:00pm, which was my scheduled appointment time. At 2:30pm I received a call from the manager stating that they ordered the wrong part and couldn't do the work on the car today. He told me I could either pick it up or just leave it there. I'm not sure why it took 2 1/2 hours to figure out that you ordered the wrong part...but I didn't have 2 days to spend on having my vehicle repaired. I mean, my whole day was pretty much wasted.   I decided to pick my car up and call around to see if there was another repair shop to do the work I requested. I wound up finding Kelly's Automotive Repair in Fountain Hills to do the work for $357 including parts, labor, shop supplies, etc. Needless to say, because Just Brakes was incompetent in ordering the wrong part...and taking 2 1/2 hours to figure it out, they lost my business. Silver lining is that I saved over $100 by them doing that.  I'll probably bring my car back for them to look at why my brakes squeak when I back up, since they were the last ones who did my brakes. Other than that, I don't really trust them anymore.

I decided to give these guys another chance and I'm sad to say that they have lost my business forever. I made an appointment online several days in advance for 12:00pm to have an alignment done. I drove all the way down there and the guy took all of my information and then when I said it was for an alignment he said they had no power and that they couldn't do it. Why wouldn't someone call me instead of making me drive  there?! Bad business. I decided to bring my car to Brake Masters instead and not only were they professional...they were $10 cheaper!

Who would have known that this is the place to be on a Wednesday afternoon?! A friend and I went here as we both were off school/work and couldn't believe how mobbed it was! About 30 of the 40 or so lanes were taken.   Anyway, this is your everyday typical bowling alley. It's not one of the XL bowling allies that has waiter service, a full arcade, etc. It doesn't need to be either...after all if I wanted an arcade I'd go to Dave and Busters...and I'm perfectly able to visit the concession stand on my own.   $10.86 got us 1 hour of bowling (about 4 games) plus shoes. Not a bad price at all! The staff was very friendly and personable. The place could use a little face-lift as far as decor goes, but it's not bad. Definitely a fun place to go!

When I visit this location it's usually to drop off my pre-paid FedEx shipments so I have limited interaction with utilizing the actual print/copy services. I find the employees to be friendly and helpful. They always offer a receipt when I drop off and always greet me with a smile. The lines can be a little long sometimes, which can be a little frustrating when all I need to do is drop off. They do have a drop box inside, which is nice, but I don't like putting my packages in there if it is past the pickup time.

I like this Starbucks even though it's ridiculously busy. In fact, I think this is the busiest one in the state...or something like that.   I usually go through the drive-thru when I go here. I like the fact that they have a drive-thru because I'm too lazy, at times, to get out of my car and go in. Fair warning though...the drive-thru can get really backed up sometimes, so it's probably quicker to park and go inside.  Working the drive-thru can be challenging because some of the drinks sound alike. I know if I worked it I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a machiato and an americano...so props to the drive thru workers who never screw my order up.

I really like this grocery store. The produce is usually fresh and they usually have everything I need in stock.   It's a no thrills grocery store...meaning there's no starbucks inside...no bar...no gelato...no sushi...it's just groceries. There is a Chase bank, which is kinda hidden. I like the fact that there aren't any thrills because I think it keeps their prices low. Also, if you spend $100, you get 10 cents off per gallon at participating Shell and Circle K stations.

I'm not really a fan of this location and usually go to the one by Target.  I went in because it was on the way to my sister's house and I wasn't impressed with the staff. In fact, they were kinda rude.  When I went in, the door was stuck and wouldn't open. An employee came around from the counter and opened it for me. He explained that it sticks when it's hot out and that most people just think they're closed and walk away. I made a joke saying, "Well I guess I need to start hitting the gym, huh?" Both employees just stared at me and smirked like, "This guy's an idiot." Feeling a bit uncomfortable I ordered my drink.   When my drink was made, the barista didn't say anything, he just set it up on the counter and began making the next one.   I felt really uncomfortable and like my business wasn't wanted. At the location by Target the employees are warm, welcoming, and friendly. I'll stick to that location from now on.

So, when I think of Señor Taco I think of one of those places that serves Mexican food and it only tastes good when you're drunk. Well, I'm wrong! I mean, I'm sure it tastes good when you're drunk but it tastes good when you're sober too! I'm addicted to the veggie burrito! I get it w/o cheese, sour cream, or pico and I add in cilantro and jalapeños (I don't eat dairy). The burrito comes with guacamole, lettuce, refried beans (not cooked in lard), and spanish rice. It is so tasty and tastes really authentic. Pair it with their mild salsa and it's AMAZINGGG!   My friend gets the chicken nachos and they're loaded with cheese and plenty of chicken. Yum if you're into that!

The best Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills.   The lunch specials are pretty amazing. You get a cup of soup (either hot & sour or egg drop), a wonton, spring roll, small side of fried rice, and your entree. And....it's about $6 or $7 with a drink.   Dinner-wise everything is pretty fresh and tasty. I have had a plethora of items here. My favorite is the Kung Pao tofu and their egg drop soup is really really good. The west lake soup is really good, but it has meat in it.   Atmosphere-wise, this place lacks severely in that department, but who cares if the food is good. I like this place for take out.

Hmmm, I'm not sure why this car wash has such poor ratings. Maybe they're aware and have made changes? Idk. All I know is they did a bomb ass job on my car the other day. I mean, my car looked like it went to hell and back...and I probably had close to a million bugs splattered on the front end. I pulled up and opted for the most expensive wash, which is something like $24.99. Not bad if you ask me. Anyway...I let the guy talk me into waxing the car...it really needed it and I don't think I waxed it in like a year. So...$50 out the door, which I didn't think was bad.   When I got into my car I could not find anything they missed. My car was immaculate inside and out.   If you ask me....I say give this place a shot. Check online before you go to see if there are coupons. Also, budget your time...allow at least 30 min. You can't have the best of both worlds expecting a bang up job in little time.

Yum! I'll definitely be back to this place!!!  So...I'm kinda weird and I'm trying this whole vegan diet thing. One of the things I struggle with giving up is pizza. I mean, you're talking to a guy who would eat pizza with like 8 different cheeses on it. Ugh. But yeah, Pisa Pizza helped me out!  When I called, the gentleman who answered the phone was very polite and accomodating to my weird request. I ordered a sicilian pizza without cheese and added fresh basil. Sounds kinda boring, right? Nah! Their crust was pretty good...it was light and crispy and not too doughy. It was cooked just right...not overdone, not underdone. The pizza sauce they use was really good too...not too garlicy and not under seasoned. The basil was fresh...I just wish there was more of it. I bet their pizza is REAL good with cheese.

You know, I really loved this restaurant and it is a shame that they have lost my and my family's business for good. First off, their management needs a lesson in customer service!   One fine Saturday evening, my parents and I were babysitting my nieces and we decided to order pizzas from Streets of New York for the whole family. One of the pizzas we asked them to hold the cheese as I'm vegan and I do not eat cheese. Well, we drive all the way there to pick up the food, drive all the way home and there's cheese on my pizza. This prompted me to call and speak to the manager who argued with me saying I said I wanted cheese on the pizza essentially calling me a liar and not offering any solution to the problem. Why would I say I wanted cheese on the pizza when I don't eat it? Doesn't make sense, right?! After spending $77 that night I was forced to order a new pizza and spend even more money and time going to pick it up.   It really stinks because I was starting to eat here about once a week. Because of the poor service I received I am no longer visiting this location.

This gas station is, on a good day, about 20-30¢ a gallon more than any other gas station in town. My recommendation would be to try going to Circle K...or, if it's on the way...the Shell gas station on rt. 87 and McDowell seems to have the cheepest gas around.   The good thing about this gas station is the free air compressor. I hate paying to put air in my tires.

Well, I must say that I was surprised by this store when I walked in. I thought it was going to be a dinky little store with really crappy items. Boy was I wrong. This store is almost a full on grocery store! They have a lot of name brand items, which I was amazed by.   I wouldn't buy produce here as most of it is bad or 1 day from going bad. The store kind of has a faint smell of rotting vegetables, then again, I do have a very keen sense of smell.   I think it's funny that they call this a 99¢ store. When I looked at my receipt, every item rang up as $0.9999. Since when do we carry out the price of things four decimal places? I mean, I thought gas stations were the only weird ones...apparently not. I mean, they should just call this a dollar store or the .9999 store. Haha. On their bags, it says they're open 9 days a week. Cheesy.   Anyway, I bought some hand sanitizer, some otter pops, and 15 egg cracker gadget things to resell. My total bill was $18 and change. Not too bad.   Aside from the poor produce section, the store was pretty neat and well organized. It was also well lit and spacious.

I guess this place is a stoner haven judging by the menu items and "munchies" they have (brownies, cookies, etc.)  I ordered the hummus which was actually very good!! It came with cucumbers, olives, and pita but I asked for more cucumbers instead.   The decor looks like Bob Marley puked everywhere but I guess it's fitting for the type of place it is.   The staff was really nice and efficient; didn't have to wait very long for the food at all.   The ice machine and iced tea were out but that was quickly rectified once I told a staff member. I'd definitely eat here again. They have something for everyone.

5 stars, no doubt! These people are definitely the nicest people I have ever met! Not only did Allen take the time to explain everything to me and answer my questions, he oiled my gun and explained everything about the gun to me after my purchase. Try to find an equal or better service at another gun store, I dare ya!   The store is a bit smaller than most I have been to but with that came 1on1 personalized service.   I went into this shop not really knowing what I wanted and left extremely happy with my purchase. Allen took the time to find the right gun for me. Most other gun shop owners would not have taken the time and would have probably sold me the most expensive gun. I could tell Allen wasn't greedy and truly cared.   The sale wasn't pushy and was more consultative than anything. I'll definitely be returning for gun purchase #3 and will, of course, tell all my friends.    My gun was brand new and still in it's original packaging and I believe the price was comparable. I didn't shop the price at all because he gave me such great service. Usually I shop around for the best price...but not this time. I'm glad there are still businesses like this one that value their customers.

$4.50 for a corona?! C'mon! That is ridiculous. For just $2 more I can buy 6 of them. Also, their margaritas aren't anything special. I ordered a chambord margarita with patron tequila and it was just meh. It was really sweet and they use that pre-made margarita mix. If you're going to charge $9 for a margarita at least use the quality margarita mix or make your own.

One word. GHETTO!  I have never been to a grocery store where you have to go outside to get a cart and then push it through a gate and walk through a little turn-style type thing to get into the grocery store. Weird. I guess it is to prevent the homeless from stealing the carts, I don't know.   Also, what grocery store runs out of butter? My sister and I went here on a Monday night to get stuff for our hotel rooms. Their produce wasn't the best, in fact all of the cucumbers were very soft and on the verge of going bad. The lettuce was browning and the fruit looked like it was all on its last leg. Anyway, we needed to get some butter as my sister's husband likes bagels with butter in the morning. Well, I guess the section where the butter is kept broke down and they had to take all of it off the shelves. Like I said, ghetto! I guess they didn't have any in the back either.   When we went to check out they had 1 lane open with a line about 10 people deep. The worst thing of it all is that the manager was just standing there fanning herself instead of opening up a register and helping the customers. It was a very frustrating experience. Next time I'll go to a different grocery store.

This place is just ok. One of the things I really like is the fact that they have almond milk. That's unique and I hope Starbucks will follow.  I went here and ordered an Americano. It was really good and didn't taste burnt...until I got to the end where the drink was very gritty. The cups they use are also really cheap and burn your hand even with the sleeve on it.   I went in right before closing, which is at 5pm. The bathroom was kind of dirty and there weren't any paper towels. Stuff like that annoys the heck out of me. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's because they were busy due to the Great Fair being in town.   I also liked their POS unit. I know that sounds kinda geeky but they use the Square where the employee rings up the item, flips it around and you enter your tip amount and sign with your finger. There are no annoying receipts or anything like that. It's pretty cool if you ask me.

"The best kept secret in Vegas" is what I heard upon my arrival into Sin City. Sad to say...let's keep it that way. Upon reviewing the Yelp page for this buffet, there's a little blurb saying Vegetarians go nuts for this place. Why?! There's literally nothing a vegetarian can eat except fruit and salad. Even the waffles and pancakes have animal products in them.   As a vegetarian I ate the salad bar, which was decent and deserving of a 2nd star. The miso soup was disgusting and my boyfriend said the pancakes were gross. For $12.99 you can get unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's and margaritas. Keep in mind the alcohol they use in these is cheap and will leave you feeling not so hot after. The orange juice used tasted like minute maid. The food doesn't seem to be quality either.   We had pretty decent service except for the lady at the fruit bar who couldn't seem to understand that I wanted mixed berries despite the fact I told her 4 times.   I wouldn't recommend this at all. The $20 per person is better spent utilizing room service or going to an actual restaurant.

5 stars all the way! Presley was awesome!!! She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept my drink full. She even gave me a togo iced tea!   I had the potato yanks to start off with, which were really good. I got them without sour cream to make them vegan but I bet the sour cream compliments this dish well. Even without the sour cream, they were still good. I also had the shredded kale and quinoa salad without Parmesan and I added avocado. The best think about this restaurant is they don't charge for avocado. How cool is that?! The salad was delicious and fresh.   For desert they offer a vegan strawberry gelato which is more like a sorbet. It was a little on the sweet side but hit the spot.   I live the atmosphere of this place, very warm and welcoming and with some really neat decor. The patio area is nice and cozy with misters and plenty of seating space. Parking can be a bit tricky as half the lot is blocked off for valet. I parked down the street and walked. Such is typical for some Phoenix area restaurants.

Yum! This restaurant located inside the Bellagio has really really good Asian food...and the wait staff is all Asian giving you a really authentic feel. The decor inside the restaurant is really nice too! It is, however, a bit pricey.  For an appetizer I ordered agedashi tofu, which is a lightly fried tofu dish. OMG! It was so freakin' good! The tofu melted in your mouth and wasn't oily at all.   For dinner I had the mixed vegetables, which were sautéed in garlic. The vegetables included baby bok choy, asparagus, snap peas, carrots, and mushrooms. It was very delicious! Even the white rice they served was very good.   My parents each had fried rice, which they said was really good.   For drinks we each had iced tea. The iced tea was very brood tasting and refreshing!

I have been going to this place ever since I was a sophomore in high school (circa 2000ish).   The food is simply delicious. I usually get the same thing and every time I'm pleasantly pleased. At about $12.50 per person (drink included) it's really worth the value. You get your entree, a drink, soup, ice cream (dinner time), rice, and wontons. The entree alone is a huge portion...of course you're in control of it.  They have many different things to choose from: white meat chicken, dark meat chicken, cod, turkey, beef, pork (I think), and tofu for us vegetarians. The veggie selection is also really good.   I always make the same sauce: chef's favorite with a scoop of spicy hunan and some hot chili oil. Maybe one day I'll venture out and try a different sauce.

So I have visited this place several times in between my first review and this review and they have managed to keep their 5 star rating. Tonight was the epitome of it all! I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too.   The staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said "sure" and made her food to perfection.   Love this place!

Went here on a date yesterday. If I had to rate the date, I'd give it one star but luckily, for LGO, they're not responsible for my grave mistakes, haha!   LGO has a variety of colorful pizzas that have your traditional cheese to more exotic things like avocado. I have never though about putting avocado on a pizza...I bet it's really good. What also makes LGO really cool is that they offer vegan and gluten free pizza crusts. Just be careful though, because their vegan crust is not gluten free and their gluten free crust is not vegan. They also offer an array of delicious salads.   I have the pizzeria chopped salad without cheese and I added avocado to it. The salad has lettuce, pistachios, raisins, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives. It's tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. It was pretty tasty and was the perfect portion for one person.   My date ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza on a gluten free crust. It looked and smelled delicious. Because I'm a vegetarian, I did not taste it. He said it was really good, however. I have had their pizzas before and they are indeed delicious.   The only problem with my experience is that my salad came out a good 15 minutes before his pizza. I did the polite Italian thing and waited for his pizza to come out before I ate my salad. It's a good thing because I would have finished my salad way before he finished his pizza. I should have eaten my salad, paid my bill and ditched the douche...but politeness prevailed in this case. Oh well.

Has a wonderful stay here when I visited Las Vegas 7/15-7/19/13. My room, which was located in tower 3 was clean, spacious, well-decorated, and had a balcony.   When I arrived at the hotel in the afternoon of 7/15 I was originally staying in tower 1. My sister was in tower 3 so I asked if they could switch me and they did with no problem and even upgraded my room to be on the 35th floor with a balcony. I couldn't have been happier!  I have stayed at this hotel in the past...I guess now they opted to take all of the dinnerware, dishes, glasses, etc. out of the room and only give them to you if you request. Requesting this was not a problem, they brought up a skillet, pots, pans, dishes, bowls, mugs, cups, wine glasses, sharp knives, forks, spoons, butter knives, cork screws, etc. up within 10 min. of me calling. My room came with a toaster, blender, and coffee maker, which was convenient.   The only thing I didn't like was the $25 ($28 with tax) resort fee they charge you. They give you 2 12 oz bottles of water every day, access to the gym, and access to the internet for the $28 so it's not like you're just pissing it away....but I feel they should give you that stuff anyway and not charge extra. Oh well. I'll still stay here again.

This mall is slowly dying. There are a lot of empty store fronts and the places that are there don't look like they're doing so well. I guess we can say it's a little ghetto fabulous? LOL.   This mall isn't even classy enough to have a Panda Express...they have some knock off place called Jade and it's just a big oily mess.   Unless you want your car broken into or stolen you're best bet is to shop elsewhere.

I'm very lucky to be living right next to this park. It has lots of paths to walk around, basketball, a mini splash pad, jungle gyms, swings, volleyball, and soccer. Definitely a fun place to chill.

WTF is up with this parking structure?! Ok, so I am really good at navigating and directions and whatnot. This parking structure is like a maze! I entered in on the ground level and then went up two levels to P2. I thought I could just park, get in the elevator and go down the the ground level. WRONG! In order to go down to floor 1 you have to have a security badge, so I wind up going down the B1 by mistake. The only way to get to the shops and movie theater is to use the stairs on the far west end of the parking garage. So here I am walking through this dark dingy parking garage having flashbacks of the movie P2...thinking some guy is going to jump out and murder me. So, I make it all the way to the west end stair case and hike up 2 flights of stairs. Yeah, that's not bad...but it had just rained so it was humid as all hell.   Not fun!

So I work right down the street from this place and I eat lunch here at least once a week.  The set up of this place is somewhat unique. When you walk in, you walk up to the counter to order your food. If you order a combo meal they give you tortilla chips and this really good hot salsa. When your food is ready they bring it out to you.   I always get the same thing here: veggie burro without cheese or tomatoes, add extra cilantro. The burro is a pretty decent size and it's full of delicious pinto beans, cilantro, avocado, and onions. I can get that and a small drink for $7, which is not bad.   The staff is usually very friendly and welcoming and the place is kept pretty clean.  It is good for small-medium sized groups as there is ample seating and booths. They also have plenty of outdoor seating.

I really like this Target! It is always clean, organized, and well stocked. Most of the employees are really friendly, professional, and helpful. There are a few cashiers that are grumpy, but I just don't go to them when they're open.   The pharmacy is also really awesome.

Ok, so I love the fact that Fountain Hills has a Ross but honestly, this store looks like it is going out of business. When I go to the Ross in Chandler...or any other Ross for that matter, the shelves are stocked and there's no empty space. This Ross is slim pickins. Many of the shelves are bare and really dusty. I wish they would stock it more.  On the bright side, people over 50 save like 10% on Tuesdays. Too bad I'm only 29!

Not a good experience here today! I went in to return some items and the woman helping me was somewhat rude and not helpful. Usually when I go in I'm in and out and have no issues. This woman was being very technical saying that the skew number on the receipt had to match the item exactly, even though it was the same item. For example, I returned a creme brulee set and the skew number on the receipt ended in 4686 but on the item it was 4687. She would not allow me to return the item even though it showed I bought a creme brulee set. I think she figured that I would just take the items back and not worry about the returns. In the long run it wound up making more work for herself because she had to do some of the returns over 2 or 3 times. Maybe she was mad because I had 8 different returns? I don't know. If you hate your job that much to where you take it out on customers then get a new job! It makes me mad because even though I was returning about $200 worth of merchandise I spend well over $1,000 there this holiday season. I could easily take my business to TJ Maxx or Marshalls. They charge a little more but at least I wouldn't have to deal with snippy little brats.   At the end of the transaction I thanked her and she ignored me and went onto helping the next customer. Sorry I made you do your job.   I will say that this is probably a one off situation. Usually the people that work there are really nice. I wish they would permanently hire some of their holiday helpers because they were seriously the nicest and most helpful.

Wow! This store is HUGE! I honestly think it is the biggest Dollar Tree I have ever been in. The store is well lit, well stocked, and for the most part, clean and organized. The only downfall is that they only had 1 checkout lane open, which was about 7-8 people deep. I felt bad going through with a rather large (30 item) order.

Yeah, idk what's going on with the stylists at this location. There was one girl that worked there that was really good and I haven't seen her in months. I guess she quit and went to a Sports Clips. Any time Supercuts gets a good employee they wind up quitting and going somewhere else. It's so sad. Anyway, the last 2 haircuts I got here were pure crap...I mean, they were uneven and weren't even what I asked for. Granted, my hair is a little difficult since it grown in like 50 different directions...it doesn't seem like the stylists care or really analyze someone's hair before they start chopping at it.   It seems like Supercuts must be a terrible company to work for since employees keep quitting and the ones that do work there seem like they don't care. I'm sure there's real talent currently employed there but doesn't seem like the company is tapping into that talent. I'm definitely going to try a different place. Ya know, for just a few $$ more you can go to a full service salon.

Wow! This place has definitely come a long way! When they first opened several years ago, this place was the type of restaurant where you would walk up to the counter, order your food and then they'd bring it out. It has since changed to a sit down place with waiter service.   Having not eaten here in several years, I decided to give them another try. I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Pad Thai which was delicious and the portion was extremely generous. The pad thai comes with tofu only, which is right up my alley as I'm a vegetarian.   On another occasion I had the kung pao tofu, which was also very flavorful.  When I ate here several years ago it was extremely greasy and bland. It has since changed to be a great restaurant that has earned my business back!

Whoever uploaded the photo must have uploaded one they found on the internet because this location looks nothing like the photo.   Anyway, this CVS is conveniently located right next to my apartment complex and whenever I go in the staff is really friendly and the store is very neat and organized. It's nice that they believe in customer service.

Yep! One of the best dollar trees in the Phoenix Metro area! I have been to the Dollar Tree in Chandler, on Via Linda in Scottsdale, the one by PV mall, and another one in Hancock Plaza in PV/Phoenix. This Dollar Tree is by far the cleanest, most organized, and well kept store. The staff is very helpful and friendly and I have never ever had a problem with this location. They also seem to have the items I need in stock. Their food items are the freshest too.

Great inexpensive Mexican food and awesome selections of tequila! I have been here many times and the food does not disappoint. I like coming here for happy hour because their margaritas are like $4 each. They have awesome flavors too.   I recommend the tacos trio or the ensalada. Both are really good.

Pretty good!  My boyfriend and I went here before we saw Jurassic World because I had a coupon for $10 off $40. I ordered the guacamole corn small plate (2 of them to be exact because they're awesome!) and my boyfriend ordered the baked potato soup. For dinner I got the kung pao spaghetti (my fave) and he got a cobb salad. The food was really good and the service was perfect. Our waiter was attentive and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.   I recommend joining their rewards club because they send out coupons pretty regularly.

So happy there is one of these in Chandler now!! I used to frequent the Indian Bend/101 location when I lived in Fountain Hills but since moving to Chandler, that's a bit of a drive for me...not that it's worth it because it totally is!  This location is set up a little bit different and I kind of like how the chips/rice/soup is separate from the cooking station...and I like how the drink station has it's own designated counter. It helps free up a lot of the traffic around the cooking area. The one thing I don't like is the cooking area seems to be very close to where people have to wait for their food to be cooked, which becomes very crowded and holds up the line. Also, when the chefs pour on water, the steam can engolf the people waiting for their food. Also, when the chef goes to clean the cook top, sometimes the dirty water splashes and hits people or gets mixed in with the cilantro and peanuts that's off to the side. I wish this was designed a little better because people literally trip over you, which can be annoying.   When I visited there were tons of fresh veggies and meats available and the place was very clean. Usually the sauce area tends to get really dirty but this one was relatively clean. They have all the standard veggies...to name a few: carrots, cabbage, spinach, celery, bean spouts, kale, green onions, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and baby corn.   It's nice being able to create your own stir fry and choose how much of what you want goes in it. It's definitely a healthier alternative to burgers and fries....and much tastier if you ask me!

LOVE this place! They have this lentil salad that is just out of this world. Every time I get it it's really fresh and crisp. I think they may make the dressing in house, though I'm not sure. It is really light and doesn't make you feel guilty. If you like Greek/Mediterranean food; give this joint a try.

Anyone who would rate this less than 5 stars is on crack!  I have not had a meal here that wasn't absolutely delicious! The cucumber rolls are awesome, the hot pot, the eggplant...ugh, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The cucumber rolls come with a peanut sauce which is seriously the best peanut sauce I have ever had in my entire life. They also make this basil sauce that is light yet so flavorful; I could drink it!   They have vietnamese coffee here and thai tea, which are awesome.   The menu is 100% vegan (except for their chocolate cake and carrot cake) and they also offer a gluten free menu. Seriously, give this place a try....you will NOT be disappointed.

Overall I thought they did a pretty bang up job. I went on their website and was able to print out a $4 off coupon and basically got their high end wash for the price of the middle one.   Navigating around this place can be a bit confusing...I couldn't tell where the entrance was and wound up looking like an idiot (not their fault).  Overall, I would return to this location. I'm giving it 4 stars because they forgot to clean my rear view mirror, which had spots on it. I didn't notice until I drove away.

This place should really be in the dive bar category, no offense. I do, however, love this place!   On Tuesdays they do taco Tuesday where their street tacos are only $1.00. You simply MUST try their tacos, they are freakin' amazing!!!  I order the vegetarian ones which has grilled vegetables, melted cheese, lettuce, corn, and a pico that isn't too tomatoey. I hate tomatoes, yet I can handle this. They also have black beans, fresh cilantro, and sometimes, roasted garlic. They come on a mini corn tortilla and are totally to die for!   This place also has "theme nights" where they'll do poker and other fun things. I have only been there on Tuesdays, so I'm unsure what else they have going on. There are also pool tables and a shuffle board table. The shuffle board is tons of fun!   The drinks aren't badly priced either. Last time I was there I ordered 2 tacos and 2 pints of bud light and I think the total was something like $9. Not too shabby if you ask me.   Definitely recommended for taco Tuesday!

So pissed off at this place! I went here to watch the Rangers-Panthers hockey game and they had it in the small TV in the upper right hand corner...not a big deal. I figured I would ask if they could change it. Well, I didn't get a chance to ask because the bartender never even acknowledged me. I literally stood there for 10 minutes and not even a, "I'll be right with you." I watched as she served other people who already had drinks but when it came to me...nothing. I walked out never to return again.

Took my boyfriend here as he loves crab and I thought an all you can eat crab buffet would be right up his alley. I paid $15.99 for him and $10.99 for me as I have a Fort McDowell players card. Not badly priced...but you get what you pay for.  The cafe has kind of a dingy dirty feel to it and appeared to be badly outdated as far as decor goes. Who cares about that though, right? As long as the food is good, that can be overlooked. Dang, the food wasn't that good.   By looking at the slop they call fettucini with pesto sauce, you can tell that it's not high quality food...or even medium quality. I think the quality of the food can be best described by quoting a song, "Shawty got low, low, low, low, low..." I pretty much stuck to eating salad, which was the saddest salad bar I have ever seen. Basically you had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, garbanzo beans, cheese, and croutons. There were only like four dressings to choose from.   Boyfriend said the crab was decent but not his favorite. That's all he ate because the other food didn't really look like food. Ever see the movie Vegas Vacation? There's a scene where Chevy Chase's character (Clark Griswold) is at a buffet in Vegas with Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie). The food totally reminds me of that!

First off, the tea sold here is AMAZING!   I went to the mall with my sister and 2 nieces last week and we decided to stop at teavana to sample to teas. The lady who helped us was very professional, nice, and knowledgeable about tea. I seriously obtained a thorough education within the 15 min. we spent together.   I sampled this chai oolong tea and it was so good I had to buy it. The tea here isn't cheap. I bought a blended mix, so it was $25 for 4 oz of tea. I guess when you break it down though, it winds up being something like $0.10 per cup.   I'll definitely be visiting this location for all of my high-end tea needs!

This restaurant, located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino is probably one of the nicest restaurants on the Vegas strip. It is quiet, fancy, and the wait staff is very professional. It is, a bit pricey, however. I think spaghetti with marinara sauce is something like $25. It is, however, probably the best spaghetti you'll eat! I had the broccoli rob ($11) and the potatoes ($11) and let me tell you...they were absolutely delicious! I can't describe the flavor because it was so perfect. While $22 for broccoli and potatoes seems a bit pricey, I think it was worth every penny. My mom had gluten free pasta in a marinara sauce and my dad had some sort of ravioli. They both said their meals were delicious as well.

LOVE this location! The employees are extremely friendly and helpful. I bought a set of tires here and purchased the warranty with them. With the warranty comes free balancing and rotation, which is really cool!   I visited this location when they were really busy and they still had me out the door within 30 minutes. I won't go anywhere else for tires!

Definitely a fun little place in Chandler.   You'd think a wine bar would be quiet and quaint but when we went it was loud and very club-like. There's plenty of seating and the service was decent. They also have little outside areas with heaters, which are cool but for some reason they allow people to go out there and smoke which blows into the inside. I thought there was a law against this but what do I know?  I ordered the spicy red flute which came with 3 half glasses of Malbec, Syrah, and a Red Zinfandel for $13. The price wasn't bad but the wine was about B-/C+. I have definitely had better but 3 glasses for $13 isn't bad. They say they're half glasses but they felt more like a full glass that you'd get at a restaurant.   The red sangria is awful and I wouldn't order that again.

This place is pretty neat. I have never seen a gun retailer focus primarily on automatic weapons. Upon walking into the store, you can see the varieties of weapons they offer. They have anything from your traditional AR-15 to the more hard to find stuff. I think I saw a few Uzi's. I'm not an automatic weapons guru, so excuse my lack of expertise here.   I visited this store to try and score some .40 S&W ammunition. At first I felt like an idiot, because why would a store that sells larger caliber fully automatic weapons carry such a small caliber bullet? Well, don't laugh at me quite yet! They also sell hand guns, though, since they focus on automatic weapons, they don't have a huge selection of hand guns. Fine by me.   So...I'm giving this 2 stars because of the service or lack thereof. When I walked in I could see that there were two employees working. One seemed to be in a pretty intense conversation with a customer toward the back of the store. The other guy working was helping a customer with some large automatic weapon. IDK what it was, but the customer looked like the Godfather. The customer kept asking really weird questions, to which the employee would respond the best he could. There was another gentleman and I waiting. The employee had several opportunities to say, "I'll be right with you" or to ask what we each wanted. I mean, all I wanted was ammo, which would have taken like 5 seconds for him to get.   Anyway, he finished up with the Godfather and began helping the other gentleman. Again, I noticed other opportunities where the employee could have asked what I needed or given me some sort of acknowledgement. The gentleman waiting just before me was kind enough to tell the employee that I just needed ammo and that was it. The employee asked what kind and I said, ".40 S&W." The employee responded, "Sorry, we are out."   Come freaking on! I waited like 25 minutes for you to tell me you're out?! Ugh! That's extremely frustrating! And for that frustration, you get a 2 star review. Why not a 1 star? Well, I'm tempted but I can tell the employee knew everything there was to know about automatic weapons and the store was very clean and neat. I guess those are moot points if you mistreat your customers. Oh well. I'll prolly stick to getting ammo from other places.

This is the best Starbucks in Fountain Hills beverage wise. I have never gotten a bad drink from this place. Service can be a little slow at times but it's not to the point where it's annoying.   I love the staff here too. They are always friendly and courteous and very very helpful. I go out of my way to visit this Starbucks.

I don't know what happened to this location but there's a completely new staff in there since the lat time I was there. Anyway, I think my 3 year old niece could have done a better job than the "stylist" who cut my hair. I have never had a more uneven haircut ever. I was shocked when I got home to see the right side of my head noticeably shorter than the rest and a really long chunk of hair on the left. Worst $18 I have spent. I won't be going back to this location.

I saw Sal today for a standard physical. I get what the previous reviewer was saying about Rebecca not listening to people and coming off as disinterested. I have heard this complaint about her from other people as well. Sal is a lot different. He showed an interest in my health and asked me if I had any plans for the summer and whatnot. It was nice that he made casual conversation with me.   Often times I feel doctors and PAs try to push prescriptions on you. I didn't get that feeling at all from Sal. In a different visit, he even recommended valerian root as a treatment for anxiety over xanax. Valerian root is a natural herb used to treat insomnia, sleeplessness, and anxiety. I appreciate Sal for this.

Friendly and efficient staff, the wait to get my pre-employment drug test was not long. The building can be a little difficult to find and the directions online are not helpful at all. The lab is actually located in the Canyon Springs building toward the back of the campus if you're coming in from Inverness.   The facility is clean, well lit, well organized, and the employees seem well trained.

Dr. Falcon is the best! This was my second visit to her in the past 2 years and I will keep going back to her. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable and professional, she is extremely friendly as well. I have never had a doctor give me the one-on-one attention Dr. Falcon gives me. It's truly amazing.   Her office staff is awesome as well. I got fitted for contact lenses today and the woman assisting me was extremely patient and extremely helpful. Last time she also helped me pick out glasses and gave me her honest opinion as far as what looked good and what didn't look good. She also knows the various insurance plans very well!   As far as their frames, they have many designer frames to choose from, which are all up to speed with today's styles.   If you're looking for a new eye doctor, look no further! Dr. Falcon is simply the best!

I had a 12:30pm appointment and it took well over an hour for them to see me. When I arrived the lady in front of me did not have an appointment, did not have an order from her doctor, and had no insurance info. Guess who they took first. Her! Pretty annoying.

So glad my mom told me about this place. Leah is the bomb! I see her every few weeks for a foto facial and she is seriously like my favorite person! She's nice, down to earth, funny, and very personable. Oh, and she knows what she's doing.   I have had 5 treatments so far and my skin feels and looks awesome. I definitely recommend foto facial treatments, especially from Leah. At $99 per treatment, they're super affordable.   The salon is currently undergoing some renovations right now. That aside, the salon is very clean, warm, and welcoming. The staff is super nice and always ask if you want something to drink if you have to wait.   The salon offers a wide variety of services from hair to Botox. I definitely recommend this place.

I went here because I sprained my ankle pretty badly earlier in the day playing laser tag at The Main Event near Ikea. The wait time was fairly long and I wasn't really pleased with the answers I got.   First, I went back and the lady took my vitals and then I waited in a room for someone to come get me to take an x-ray. They wheeled my into a room that was like 35º below zero where I sat for a good 15 min. I'm glad I waited in the waiting room to wait some more. Anyway, someone got me and I laid down on the x-ray table that was from the 1970s. Seriously, this thing looked pretty old. In order for the guy to get a complete xray he had to adjust the whole table to be lined up with the thing that takes the xray. After about 10 min. of him trying to line it up he took the first xray and then had to do the whole thing over again. This happened 3 or 4 times. After he was done I went back into the freezing room and waited for the doctor (PA) to come in.   I met with Devon Auth who asked me what happened and asked if I was in any pain. He said he'd get me over to get some xrays done...even though I just had them done. I explained that they already took xrays...seemed like everyone in that place wasn't on the same page. Anyway, he explained what would happen next and recommended I see an orthopedist if my condition worsened. He examined my foot and pointed out that there wasn't any bruising. I was like, "Ummm, it just happened a few hours ago...I bet there will be plenty of bruising later." Any joe shmo knows that it takes several hours for bruising to show up. He then asked if I was in any pain and I explained that I was. He sort of gave me a little bit of an attitude when it came to pain meds. I wasn't asking for them, I merely asked for his recommendation and if he though ibuprofen would be strong enough. I told him that I was fine with ibuprofen because I don't like taking narcotics.   After all was said and done, they wrapped my ankle in a splint and sent me on my way. I didn't feel they took my condition serious enough because on Monday (I visited this location on a Thursday) I went and saw an orthopedist because my condition did in fact worsen. The orthopedist explained that the condition was serious because at least 1 ligament was torn and that if I just took Mr. Auth's advice it was likely that my ankle would not have properly healed, making me susceptible to chronic re-injury.   I'm sure this location is good with the standard stuff like the flu, colds, etc. It doesn't seem like they're knowledgeable or equipped for the more serious or one-off stuff.

This place is a vegan's dream come true! Everything on the menu is vegan by default and if you want dairy, you have to request it! the menu is pretty sizeable and includes everything from french toast for breakfast to some sweet treats for dessert! I had the Chick-un wrap which comes with a vegan aioli and some really delicious marinated kale, avocado, and a bunch of other yummy stuff. For dessert I gave their cheesecake a try, which was....eh. I also had their version of an almond joy which was awesome! They also have some pretty delcious looking cookies. The service was good and I'll definitely be back.

I really really really like this gym. It is not overcrowded and the equipment isn't falling apart. I pay $41 per month, which may seem a little steep but it includes the classes. I was a member at 24 hour fitness, which was terrible. I paid $29 per month for equipment that was falling apart and 1980s decor. This gym is modern, hip, and has a TV on every elliptical! I think it is fairly priced and I'm not locked into a contract. I am happy to say that I recommend this gym!

Cutting straight to the chase, the Spanish soup is AMAZING!   So one summer afternoon my friend and I decided to go to Bass Pro shop to check it out. After we were done there we looked around Mesa Riverview for a place to each lunch. Not being familiar with the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was around and found Matta's. Me being a vegan, it probably wasn't the best place to go as everything (except the Spanish soup) has dairy. The waitress wasn't really that helpful in telling me what items I could pick from. All she said was, "this probably isn't the right place for you." Kind of a rude comment...especially since there's only 1 item on the menu. Anyway, I will say that the Spanish soup was delicious and I would go back just for it.

I love local small businesses such as this one because they give you the one on one attention you need in order to make an informed decision. I went here for some new running kicks not knowing much about anything. They put me on the treadmill and analyzed my step which allowed them to pick the best running shoe for me. It's this one on one attention that makes local businesses better than any national chain.

Ummm, can I have a little Mexican food with my salt?   Holy crap! This food is over salted and waaaaaay over seasoned. I went here and ordered a veggie bowl thingy and I did not like it at all. The peppers and onions (fajitas) were way over cooked and tasted like they were sitting there all day. The guac was bland and over salted, and the lettuce wasn't crunchy. The food was luke warm and really not impressive at all.   I will say, their chips are really good. Maybe get nachos or something?

Hands down the best restaurant in Fountain Hills!  When you go here you MUST try the chips and salsa. They make the chips in house and they are seriously THE BEST tortilla chips I have ever had. The salsa is also nothing short of amazing. It is fresh, flavorful, and refreshing.   I have NEVER had something here that I didn't like. I have been here for both lunch and dinner. During lunch, their breakfast menu is available. If you order off of that, try the tamale y huevos. The tamales are amazing. They're light and have fresh veggies in them (if you order the veggie one). They also come with a side of potatoes, which are the best potatoes I have ever had.   Next time you're in Fountain Hills, definitely stop in here. You will not be disappointed.

Went here the other night and I ordered the chopped salad, the pimientos, and some red sangria.   The pimientos, which are cooked peppers, were SOOOOO good! There were a few spicy peppers in there, which made this appetizer flavorful.   The chopped salad was the usual deliciousness. I got it without cheese and with the lime dressing instead of the creamy chipotle dressing they put on it. In the past I have had it with the chipotle dressing and it's reallllllly good.  The red sangria was good, a little sweet, but the fruit was plentiful and it was refreshing. I like sweet though, so it's all good.

The teriyaki bowl with tofu is absolutely delicious!!  I seriously love love love this restaurant. They have something for everyone here and it's all healthy food. I'm a vegan and they have vegan items on the menu...and they'll also customize things for your dietary needs.   The vegetable crudites are awesome as well. I get it with a side of hummus for dipping. It's the perfect appetizer.

I just love little coffee shops like this! I ordered an Americano with just a splash of almond milk and it was SO GOOD! The espresso was nice and smooth and didn't have a burnt taste.  The coffee shop also has an assortment of loose leaf teas that you can enjoy and offers some nice looking baked goods.  Don't drink dairy milk? No problem! They offer soy and almond milk.

If you're a vegetarian do not go here...there is not one vegetarian item on the menu. The guacamole tostada sounds like a safe bet right? NOPE! There's lard in the tostada. Lard in the tortilla chips too...ugh.   Not only does the menu suck, the service is 50 times worse. The restaurant literally has 13 tables in what feels like a 10x10 jail cell. My boyfriend and I waited for the check for literally over 20 minutes....just sitting....and waiting. It took us less time to drive there, order, get our food, and eat than it did to get the check.   Don't expect your drink to be refilled either...unless you're drinking water.    The food....not even that good.

The best haunted house I have ever been to! Wow! While waiting in line there are characters that come and entertain you and they make it really fun. I purchased 2 general admission tickets and waiting in line about 45 minutes. If you get there when they first open or when they're about to close, the line seems to be a little shorter, though that probably won't be the case as it gets closer to Halloween. I don't want to give too much away so all I will say is that the acting is great, the props are fun, the makeup is spot on and the acting is superb. Definitely worth the wait.

I'm really glad this place exists because standup comedy is like one of my favorite things! I went here in early December 2015 to see Sebastian Maniscalco and it was a funny experience!  First off, you're packed in there like sardines and it's very difficult to get in and out of your chair because the seats behind you are like right up against you and the person next to you and practically on top of you.   The service is pretty bad. Several orders were messed up and drinks never arrived but we're still charged. Incorrect change was also given back to some customers.   There is a 2 drink minimum, which seems to be standard for comedy clubs. I basically spent $15 on iced tea. Lol.

Well, I didn't have any sort of voucher or coupon for a free drink, unfortunately. I had to pay full price :(. The cool thing is that you can take the drinks to go if you'd like. They'll put it in a big plastic cup for you. They also make the drinks moderately strong so you don't feel jipped or like you're wasting your money.  I visited this place twice during my stay at The Signature. Both times I ordered a vodka soda with Ciroc vodka the first time and Grey Goose the second time. Prepare to pay anywhere from $12-$16 for a drink with tip. Ouch. Also, in eyeing their bar, it didn't seem like they had much of a selection, but I could be wrong.   The place is very cozy and chill...it's a nice little lounge. The staff is also very nice and professional.

So, I must admit that when I walked into this restaurant I did not really know what I was doing. As a recently minted Vegan my friends have been telling me to try this place. Figuring from their name, they'd have vegan options or at least items you could modify to be vegan. Upon looking at the menu the "Big Mac" grabbed my attention. It mentioned that it was a vegan burger but had cheese. "Why would they do this?" I asked my friend. "Why would they put cheese on a Vegan burger and make it un-vegan? Why even bother making the burger vegan then?" I queried. She then pointed to a section on the menu that described the restaurant. Much to my surprise, Green is a 100% vegan restaurant!  Now, I didn't know what to get because everything sounded good, being Vegan. The waitress suggested we get the special they were offering that night, which they were doing for NYE 2013. The special included hot & sour soup, "egg" rolls, vegan crab puffs, BBQ "chicken" skewers, some baby bok choy, and some sort of vegan duck dish. I have never had duck so I have no basis for comparison. I must say, everything was absolutely delicious! The vegan crab puffs...I can't get over how good those were.  They also have really unique drinks and they do offer beer and wine.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant or their Tempe location.

I have recently fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos! This location serves them up pretty well with generous portions of peppers and onions, corn, sour cream, and lettuce.   I work in the area and my lunch break is usually slightly after the lunch rush so when I visit this location they always seem to be winding down from the busy lunch rush, which means I often have to wait while the employee does something else. Sometimes the "assembly line" doesn't move as efficiently as possible...but the place is always clean and the food is always fresh.  I don't know if you know this, but Chipotle serves Mexican and some Domestic beer and margaritas! I didn't have one this time because I was on my lunch break...but from previous experience, the margaritas are pretty good and really strong. Definitely try one some time!

Previously I wrote how I had fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos. While these are still delish, I have a new love in my life and that's the soft flour vegetarian tacos. Here's what I do: - Brown rice - Black beans (the pinto beans have bacon) - Fajitas (peppers & onions) - Medium salsa - Corn - Lettuce - Guacamole  I bet these are REALLY good with sour cream and cheese as well, but I'm trying to cut out the dairy. The medium salsa is AMAZINGGGG! I can't believe that after all of these years I am now just discovering it.   I really like this location. The employees are really upbeat, positive, friendly, and very very helpful. The restaurant is always clean and you can tell that the kitchen where they cook everything is spotless.

The best staff ever!!  I can't believe how nice the staff is here. They are always happy to help you and truly enjoy what they do. Lately I have been eating here almost every day for lunch and have never been disappointed. The addition of tofu Sofritas really sealed the deal for me as I'm vegan.

Awesome place if you're vegan, vegetarian, and/or gluten free. This place has a TON of vegan options from pizza to pasta to chicken wings! I ordered some vegan chicken wings and a vegan pizza with vegan meatballs. Holy crap, it was good!  Our service wasn't the greatest. Our waiter seemed like he was in a big hurry and was walking away as we were trying to order our appetizers. They also screwed up my dad's pizza twice. All he wanted was a pizza with sauce and grated cheese. They made him a pizza with cheese and sausage and then another with mozzarella and parmesan. He clearly stated, "Just sauce and parmesan." Maybe if the waiter wasn't in such a hurry he would have gotten it right the first time.   This place is located in the Mandalay Shops in between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. I was staying at Vdara and it was well worth the walk. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll visit this place.

Pretty neat place! I volunteered here on 7/3/14 and packed nutrients for starving children. My group and I packed 21 boxes of 38 bags each. This company is organized and they tell you everything you need to do. They play music while you work and it's a really fun experience. I can't wait to volunteer here again!

Went here for lunch after a movie and I must say, the food isn't really that great and it's pretty expensive. I ordered veggie tempura which was friend to hell! Tempura is supposed to be light and crispy, this looks like there was too much batter or something on it. I also ordered an avocado roll, which was nothing special. The seaweed was exceptionally salty. My friend got some chicken dish that was almost $25 and he said it was just ok. His Sprite also had no syrup in it. For the price they charge I would rate the food a 4/10.

I get a little worried with Fountain Hills businesses because the town can't seem to keep anything. I really really really hope this location stays because it's seriously the only place I trust changing my oil. The employees at this location are simply the best. They're very good at explaining things and helping you out. They also do a really great job and are speedy. They don't try to upsell you stuff you don't need and are very honest.

This was my first visit to this location that just opened up. Upon walking in, you can tell this restaurant is new as it is oh so clean. The decor is awesome and the atmosphere is great! Above the registers the menu is projected on large, easy to read screens.   As for the food, I ordered the broccoli & ginger tofu w/ brown rice. I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It was the perfect sized portion and left me satisfied. Bravo to the chefs at this location!   The place was immaculate!

I wanted to like this place sooo bad because of the reviews I read and because we got a $40 for $20 deal through MyVegas. I started off with a hummus plate which was decent abs I skipped the feta because a) I'm lactose intolerant; b) feta really bothers me; and c) I'm vegan. I also skipped the feta on the Greek salad I ordered.   Guess what was on my salad? Feta! I tried to get as much of it out of the salad as I could but I missed some and my stomach was a mess the entire day. Ugh!

This Post Office isn't the greatest. The lines are usually ridiculously long and they usually only have 1-2 workers working at any given time. I wish people would learn how to use the automated machine in the lobby to ship things....or buy stamps.   I have had a few bad experiences with this Post Office as well as far as not delivering mail, delivering mail to the wrong address, and not picking up packages when pick ups were scheduled. I run a little eBay business out of my home and chose not to ship USPS but to ship FedEx instead because of all the mistakes USPS makes.

I don't understand why this Starbucks has such bad reviews! I stayed at The Signature at MGM Grand in tower 3 for 5 days and visited this Starbucks for 3 of those 5 days and had 0 problems. Each time I went in there, no one else was in there and my drinks were made very promptly. The staff was friendly and my drink tasted very good.

I work at PayPal, so I visit this place quite frequently on my lunch break. The menu, however can be a little confusing for a first-timer. What you have to do is grab the proper sandwich bag and fill it out. For example, number 6 is the vegetarian bag and then you look up at the menu and see what your options are. The vegetarian options are: hummus, mediterranean, caprese, and there's one other. You then fill out your bag on how you'd like your sandwich made. The first time I went I grabbed a bad that was like their ultimate sandwich or something like that, so when I got it, it was loaded with meat. Not so good for a vegetarian...lol.   The last time I visited here I ordered the hummus sandwich with crispy onion strings, lettuce, jalapeno, banana peppers, salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, pickles, garlic powder, oregano, olives, and bell peppers. It was seriously sooooo good!

This is a great store with very helpful staff. The customer service gets 4 stars, the pricing gets 0 stars. I bought a pair of Prada sunglasses here for $330.00. I wound up finding them online for $189. I returned them the next day. My recommendation would be to research pricing before you buy a pair of sunglasses here.

Horrible horrible place!   My sister, niece, and grandparents went here for Valentines Day to try out the "new restaurant in town." I must say that it was nothing short of horrible.  When we first walked in we stood there for about five minutes before anyone greeted us. They were pretty busy due to it being Valentine's Day...and whenever a new restaurant in Fountain Hills opens up, it's the buzz of the town for a few weeks. Anyway, we're finally seated in the back by the kitchen. We sit there for about 15 minutes before the waitress comes to take our drink order. We wound up putting our drinks in with our appetizer and food because we had so much time to decide. I ordered the pepper beef and asked if they could substitute tofu for the beef, as I'm a vegetarian. They said that this was no problem.   About 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and they must have been sitting out for a really long time because the ice was all melted in them. Still no appetizer. By then, my sister, who is a waitress was growing irritable because she has two kids to feed and our appetizer still wasn't out.   Finally, after about 25-30 minutes our food comes out and it's wrong. My grandfather, who is a diabetic, does not get his and my dish is wrong. Still no appetizer.   My sister gets up to get the waitress who walks over, shrugs her shoulders and walks away. No apology, no remedy, nothing. So, finally, after 15 minutes, my food finally comes out correctly. My grandfather still doesn't get his.   When the waitress came back around we asked to speak to a manager. No manager ever came by and the waitress just started to ignore our table. Our drinks weren't refilled and our check took another 30 minutes to come. What was supposed to be a 45 minute dine-in experience turned into over 2 hours. Get this, despite all of our complaints we were still charged full price! And, this place is NOT cheap.   When I brought the check up to the owner to complain she just looked at me and kept saying, "Yeah.....yeah.....yeah." In other words, I don't care, go away.   We will not be back and I hope this place goes out of business!

This place is absolutely gorgeous! Supposedly the owner is an interior designer and it really shows. They have really good flavors of yogurt and frozen ice and a pretty wide selection. When it comes to the toppings bar, it is clean and plentiful.   It's nice to have this in Fountain Hills. It is conveniently located right by the Fountain.

I recently used All My Sons to move a storage unit in Fountain Hills, AZ to an apartment in Chandler, AZ. The movers who showed up (2) were very professional and moved quickly. I was also impressed when the owner of the company called me the day before to thank me for choosing them.   I budgeted $600 for my move and it wound up costing around $300. They do require a $50 deposit when you book with them but that deposit gets applied toward your bill at the end. The fees and costs were disclosed to me up front so there weren't any surprises.  The only complaint I have is I tried to reach them on a Sunday afternoon and I guess they were closed. Rather than saying their office was closed on the recording it just keeps repeating as if you're on hold waiting for someone. I held for an hour and 20 minutes and then finally hung up.

Awesome staff!! They were so nice and full of personality. Every time I go here I get the same thing: a pizza with no cheese, no meat, and loaded with veggies. A little weird but they were very courteous to my veganism and even washed the pizza cutter before slicing my pizza. So nice!

All around poor customer service!  I originally visited this store in early November and bought my dad a Patriots shirt. Buying the shirt was ridiculous as there were like 8 people standing in line and only one person on the register with about 5 other employees standing around. One of the employees even went up to the one working the register and asked if he needed help and the cashier replied with "no." About 20 minutes later I was able to check out.   Comes out that the shirt I bought was too large so I went online to the Lids website and ordered my dad a different one and chose to have it shipped to the store to avoid a shipping cost. The website did not tell you what the ETA was on shipping. About 5 days passed and I didn't get any email updates or anything so I decided to call the customer service number, which I hate doing. Anyway, they said they were experiencing long hold times and to either hang on, call back, or to press 1 and have a representative call you back when one is available. Mind you, this message plays over and over as you hold. After about 30 minutes I pressed 1. No one ever called me back. A few days later I called again and the same thing happened. Finally I called the store to see if it was in and the guy just said no without getting any of my info or even looking.  Several days later I received a call saying my item was in and to pick it up. This was about 10 business days after I placed to order. Talk about snail mail! Anyway, I went to pick up the item and I guess the manager is the only one authorized to do these types or orders so I had to wait awkwardly as the manager finished ringing up a customer and doing some other side work that was apparently more important than me. I explained that I needed to do a return (the shirt that was too large) and pick up and online order. It took about 20 minutes for all of this to happen but I finally got the shirt and left never to return again.

This Dollar Tree is awesome! It's usually cleaned and organized and the staff is really friendly. Randy is usually there every day and he is always nice and very helpful.

My new favorite lunch spot!!  When I went here for the first time the other day I didn't know what to expect. From visiting the website it looked like they had pizzas you could order and you could also customize your own. From experience, usually a place will charge you per topping, so I went in expecting to pay a hefty price. I don't eat cheese or meat so usually I just get a pizza with sauce and a bunch of veggies.   When I walked in I saw that it was a Subway style pizza place where the worker takes prestretched dough off of a rack and puts the sauce and cheese on and then passes it down for the meats, who then passes it on down to another person for the veggies. I ordered a pizza with marinara, no cheese, red onions, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, pepperoncini, and kalmatta olives. To my astonishment it was only about $10 WITH a drink! Awesome!   It was so good I visited this place the next day and got the same pizza only I added the olive oil/garlic combination, fresh basil and oregano. It was TO DIE FOR! I will be back here many more times!

Went here with my work team for a team outing and we had a ton of fun! Just be careful though because this place has potential to be a little bit of a money pit. Some of the arcade games are a little expensive to play and you can blow through $40 in a matter of a few minutes.   The laser tag was tons of fun even though I got hurt playing it. Hey, at least I won the round. Haha.   There are lots of things to do here including karaoke, eating, arcade games, laser tag, and suspension lines. It's a lot of fun and great for small-large groups, birthday parties, etc.

Pretty neat addition to the Las Vegas strip. The high roller takes you up 550 feet to view the Las Vegas skyline in an air conditioned cabin. Don't worry...there are plenty of places to buy a drink before you go on your 30-minute journey. Each cabin holds about 35-40 people and it costs about $20 during the day and $35 at night.

I bought a Groupon to try this place out and also because my mom recommended it. The Groupon was $99 for 50 units of Dysport. I went in and the lady who helped me, Susan, was very nice. I'm sad to say that the first set of injections didn't work. I called and explained what happened and they scheduled me to go back in and have a touch up done, which the didn't charge me for. They injected me with some more Dysport and sadly, it's still not working. :( I'm really disappointed that it's not working for me because I'm desperate to get rid of the wrinkles in my forehead. The ladies who work there are really nice and I don't feel right about asking for my money back since they essentially injected me with 100 units of Dysport and made a good fait effort to resolve my concern. I think I'll go somewhere else next time and try botox and see if that works.

Stopped into this store to purchase some dress shoes for a new job I started and I must say, I was rather pleased. The employees were super nice and super helpful as they walked around and asked if we were finding everything ok. There are some businesses that understand the importance of customer service...I mean, with social media, you can't really be mean to customers anymore. This business is part of the elite that get it. The shoes aren't badly priced and they have a pretty wide selection of designer brands. Definitely a good place if you're looking for something nice without having to pay out the rear.

Came here for an employment drug screen. The hours posted online and on the door say 8:00AM-3:00PM and that they're closed from 12:00PM-12:30PM for lunch. I got here at 11:43AM and the door was unlocked, the door from the lobby into the back was left open and no one was up front. At about 12:01PM the lady came back and was like, "How did you get in here?!" I must have scared her because she wasn't expecting someone to be in the lobby. She did my drug test despite it being her lunch time. She was really nice and called me "babe."

Love this place!   My boyfriend and I eat here a lot! The staff is ultra friendly and helpful and will basically customize any item you want. They also have a mobile app you can download and when you take a picture of your receipt they give you what is called a "goodie." So far I have gotten a free side, a cup of limeade, and 1/2 off a sandwich.  Some things to try: - Braised white beans - Potato salad (cold and grilled) - Greek salad - Hummus  I usually go for the gluten free hummus and salad plate, which comes with cucumber instead of pita.   For you meat eaters, they have protein bowls, kabobs, and I hear the turkey sandwich is really good.

What a fun little place at Chandler mall! The food is good and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. We went on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all and we got amazing service from this waitress from Indiana. She knew all about the menu and was really personable   I ordered the bio bowl which is the vegan option offered on the menu. It is full of veggies, beans, and rice and it really full of flavor. I got it with some red sauce to add a little more depth and flavor. It was really good.   We also ordered a margarita pitcher which was well made and had chunks of fruit in it. A pitcher will run you about $27 and you'll get 4 drinks out of it total, not bad! They also have Pacifico on tap, which is awesome!  For desert I had the pumpkin tamale which was really good and supposedly vegan. They can also made their brownie desert vegan without an egg, but it takes 15-20 minutes to make. It's nice to see a restaurant catering to their customers. I'll definitely be back!

Tons of fun!!  This place is definitely good for a family event or for a work team-building event. We decided to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday here and we had a group of 9 to escape the apartment. I'm happy to say that we got out with just a few minutes to spare!   Definitely worth the money as it's an overall fun experience. I recommend it.

So glad I found this place!!! Next time I visit Vegas I'll make sure I stop in here. The menu is vast and has something for everyone and the staff is so friendly! If you're a visiting vegan or a Vegas vegan, definitely give this place a try.   If you check in on Yelp you get a free bowl of chili that's so good, even my meat eating boyfriend liked it.   I also ordered the lemon scampi which is tofu and veggies in a lemon garlic sauce over spaghetti or yellow quinoa if you're gluten free. I had it over quinoa and the dish was very good except the quinoa was a little over cooked and soggy probably because of the sauce.   The decor of this place is also really cool with neat artwork on the wall.

Brought my family here to celebrate my birthday as I wanted to do something a little different. Usually we go to True Foods for all of our family birthdays but I figured I'd give this place a try since I heard good things. We sat outside, which was a big mistake. They had a one man live band playing that was just God awful and it reached a point where we couldn't take it anymore and left.   When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they'd refrigerate it for her. Well, when she brought it, they didn't put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined.   The food was decent. I had the veggie burger which was good. The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor. We also ordered guacamole, which was really good.   They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags, which looks like a lot of fun. I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible. I don't think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be.  I'm willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday. I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake.

Totally addicted to the Doc Holiday salad. While I was looking up their hours I stumbled onto their website and found that you can order online! Their online ordering system is probably the best and most intuitive online ordering systems I have seen. Placing the order was really easy and my order was ready to go when I arrived. The salad, as always was delicious. They out the dressing on the side, which I thought was really nice. This place is going to become an addiction!

Well, the MAD Greens addiction is in full swing as this is my second day in a row eating it. I stopped into this location to order a big Doc Holiday salad. This location seemed a little bit off kilter, however. I have had the pleasure of trying out 3 of the 4 locations and usually don't have any sort of issue...not that I had an issue this time. It's just the the avocado added to the salad didn't look so hot and I ordered a big salad and she put it in the regular sized bowl so it was squished and hanging out the sides. Also, since I got it to go, it would have been nice to have a bag so I didn't have to carry the salad, fork, straw, napkins, and jar or MAD spice I bought. Anyway, it's a newer location so there are probably some kinks to iron out. These are just minor things but I felt they were worth mentioning so they could be corrected.

Went here the other night and ordered a Doc Holiday salad. The salad was absolutely delicious. I recommend it with tofu instead of chicken as their tofu is the best I have ever tasted. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor.

Looking for something healthy and tasty? This is your place! Finally! Fountain Hills has a restaurant owned by people who understand health and are able to cook in a way that is flavorful. It's about time a restaurant was opened that catered to the healthy people out there. Fountain Hills is full of pizza places, Italian food, Mexican food, and Asian food...and like hardly any of it is good.   I had the Yogi bowl which is served with a delicious side salad. The yogi bowl features sautéed vegetables in a delicious sesame ginger sauce on top of a bed of brown rice. Everything is gluten free and mostly organic. The flavor was intense and I left feeling satisfied and not like a house.  My mom had the eggplant dish which was out of this world. Definitely give this restaurant/cafe a try but be a little patient as they just opened. The service was good and the owners/chefs are knowledgeable and passionate! I'll be back.

Finally there's a haircut place for men that truly cares about their clients and isn't unit driven. I love the way Alexis cuts my hair and everyone that works here is super chill. I recently signed up for the membership and get unlimited haircuts for only $26 per month. Worth every penny!
