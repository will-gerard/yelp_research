I love this place. Everyone I know raves about it, and every item I try is out of this world! I recommended it to a friend, unfortunately he doesn't understand the appeal of fresh authentic ingredients and the rustic charm of the place. He's missing out!

A chain should always be a well oiled machine and this spot sure is! Attentive staff that's knowledgable and recommends great options. Wine lost should be called wine lost. An iPad because there are about 529406373 wines.. I get it having variety helps but dang...

Got to love a qualified and courteous service team! Vehicle is always ready when told, making appointments is a breeze, and transportation needs are always met! Having a cup of coffee and oodling over the new cars is always nice too! Be sure to contact Mel Charles for all your Land Rover service needs. Trust him exclusively with our Supercharged Range Rover.

This location is fab for many reasons. The renovation is awesome! The staff is super nice and helpful. Yeah, there is no WIFI (how is that possible!?!?) and it can get a bit cramped inside. However, it's just up the road from the disaster of a store at Scottsdale road and pinnacle peak. I make the jog over to come to this store, and it's 99/100 times faster. I love the sit down bar area in front of the clover brewing system! All in all - the way every store should be. Oh, can't forget the awesome patio space thy have!

Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre-packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux; other than a million locations. Keeping the service consistent would help. Sometimes it's stellar sometimes it's horrid. Guess it depends on how their day is going. Still was in 3 times today #shameless

This trip wasn't as bad. Minus the heard of children ripping tags off things, collecting them, and throwing them on the floor. Again, while parents pay no regard to what their gremlins are doing

DELICIOUS! Amazing service; I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in the door. Excellent Pinot Noir paired with my meal.  Restrooms are a little tricky, right by the kitchen, got bumped by fellow patrons and staff; none the less did not detract from my experience!

I am frequently at this location because of their $4.99 Lunch sandwich special. It appears to be location exclusive as Thompson Peak and FLW, Central & Camelback to name a few do not have such special. Oh yeah, and a drink included and your choice of side? I think so!

Was here the past week for a private event, got to say, not very many establishments have the feel Olive&Ivy has. The ambiance is PRICELESS. What a great time of year to relax on the patio with a glass of wine and a flatbread! Dined with larger groups here as well, VERY accommodating staff. Great menu, great wine.   All and all, an awesome place. Will definitely be back soon for a date night!

Online system down. They flaunt the ability to make an appointment. However, well good luck with that. Be sure you catch them at a good time. I'm sitting with an entire restaurant staff currently... Hoping to get out of here before I'm 50. No one answers he phone, and starting 9/29 no drug screens at this location

What's not to love about a locally owned restaurant with a great menu!? They always feature new lunch and dinner specials and a great happy hour (2-6)!  The list of beers may be overwhelming, try the "Beer of the Month". only $3! Be sure to catch the "Drunk of the Moment", or become a wine of the month member (it's free!).  Say what you will about parking you Phoenicians, but have you been to San Diego, San Francisco..? Ok then moving on; There's a few spots in the front and a lot on Pierson that's always open.  Also one of the only spots along Central with Beer and Wine To-Go!

Fairly quiet, great floor plans, closets to love, but location is everything! Can't be any closer to the light rail! Restaurants and places for a night cap are within walking distance in basically any direction. The new management has put a ton of great things into this place, fixing the gates and trimming the trees alone has made a huge impact. The old management had hired some very harassing security folk, who we had several run ins with, no issues at all anymore! I Dog friendly, awesome grill by the pool, all in unit or garage washer & dryer (a luxury in its own) you will get what you pay for. Few improvements I would suggest, more than one recycling bin, pet waste facilities along the exterior, and maybe another BBQ or two. Can't wait to see what the in unit renovations have in store, this place has great bones but with the proper touch will be perfect! Side note, it's the city.. Parking is at a premium in this prime location

(insert plug for mobile ordering here) They're always friendly, and remember names and even my drink! How they do it - I have no idea but it keeps me a happy customer! GREAT JOB TEAM ESPLANADE!

Tried this place on opening day because of the freebies on behalf of my father. We have always gone to Luke's (yes, the 16th Street location too) and needless to say, I was disappointed. Had I not been to Luke's before, I'm sure my experience would have been better. Too commercialized, mid range tasting food. I won't be back on my own that's for sure.

Maybe we could write a book report on the wine.... A server told us in response to our question on a bottle on their list. RED FLAG. Crab legs, very simple... Shreds of crab meat on top of my steak? Not the same. I understand the place is rockin, but c'mon... thank goodness management took over for us.

Ive been coming to this location for quite some time now. I can walk in and get my haircut in a reasonable amount of time. This time was different. I had almost an hour wait, which I managed to wait through, only to find out it didn't end there. Sonya gave me a prompt time of when a stylist would be available. Much to my surprise someone else got say with that stylist at the exact time she quoted me. I waited a little while longer and eventually left. I then called in to ask why my time that she quoted me was given to someone else, was then instructed that they had been on a delay, and a stylist would be available in 15 minutes. This all could have been avoided if she, instead of offering me a beverage, told me that they were on a delay that would push me back another 30 minutes. I told her that she had been in the wrong and that I would no longer be supporting their establishment... To which she said, "ok I'm sorry". A little respect for your clients goes a long way, as they are your livelihood.

I purchased a black SUV over a year ago that needed some love. I held off until I was referred to Superior Detail by a friend. I was shocked that they were able to bring back a showroom new sparkle to my SUV! Was lucky enough to request an at home detail, something that is increasingly hard to find! The before and after photos are incredible, brought back the beautiful deep color I knew was there!

Chef Binkley's name is world renowned, and his culinary creations are one of a kind. That being said; if you're looking for hefty portions overfilling a serving platter for pennies on the dollar, please go elsewhere.   The food is truly inspired, combining several flavors textures and colors, not the type of common fare you'll find elsewhere. Be brave, branch out, try something you wouldn't normally gravitate towards. You won't regret it!   Ambiance is traditional, while bringing a nice brightness and clean style to the table no pun intended. The patio is an amazing spot to have a relaxing lunch with friends over cocktails and noshing on shared items.   You will get the quality food you are paying for, and cocktails to match. Reading other reviewers comments just makes me shake my head; if you want to really be wowed try try Binkeys in Cave Creek. But don't let me hear you gripe about what you're spending; you know darned well what you're ordering and how things add up.

If you're in the drive thru lane, please be courteous to the patrons who have parked and walked in to the store. When they are attempting to back up, please do not move your vehicle directly behind them blocking their attempt at exiting the establishment. Its really common courtesy, to not block someone in when you can blatantly see they're trying to leave.

High rise living at its finest! Being steps from dining, shopping, entertainment and more is just one of the perks! A 24 hour access pool and entry to the Hotel Palomar's pool aren't such a bad perk either! A variety of floor plans make finding the perfect new home a breeze, you just have to decide which view you want! Pet friendly building with No weight limit on dogs for us large dog owners (VERY hard to find!!). GAS stove, wood flooring, quality appliances and more!

Along awaited and overdue! I cannot express how pleased I am this Phoenix staple has now joined the Scottsdale scene! A great venue for meeting old and new friends alike over some delicious nibbles and great wine! This location offers something over the others, much more draft beer! With 10 choices on draft, there's something to please everyone! And for those who don't know, Monday and Tuesday is the BEST deal in town! Team service assures the guests feel welcomed and their experience is special! Can't wait to be back.
