It's a restaurant inside of a rundown strip-mall, so I almost didn't go in at all. But I had heard good things about this Chinese/Mexican fusion, so I had to try it out. I wasn't disappointed. Their food was amazing. The Jade Red Chicken is a must and everything that I've tried on the menu (been there a few times  now) is flavorful and delicious. Large partions. And the staff is friendly and helpful for newbies (there menu ordering system is confusing). You can even try samples of things if you're not sure what you want.  I'm always in the mood for Chino!

We used to have family to watch our dogs while we were away but that wasn't an option anymore and because of this we hadn't taken a vacation in a long time. After being recommended this place from a coworker, we decided to give it a try. We were nervous, but our worries were quickly alleviated by the photo updates as well as following their Facebook and Instagram pages. They don't just store the dogs like junk, shuffling them away in cages until the pet parents come back, they love playing and cuddling and interacting with the dogs in the large communal play area. They are accommodating, friendly, and obviously animals lovers. I no longer have to worry about my dogs while I'm on vacation.

I too purchased 2 certificates in advance for another class for my husband and I, after I had so much fun at Pop Up Your pet. But now it seems the business is closed. At first, while the website worked, it said it was temporary due to family emergency, which is understandable but I kept an eye on the calendar for the classes to start up again only to discover the website is gone, the Facebook page is gone, and apparently the money I spent on advance tickets is also gone. No notes, no info, no returns calls or emails. In researching what happened to the owner/instructor I discovered he now resides in Alaska. Now I, along with a lot of other customers that loved his classes enough to buy advance tickets, are out money as a "thanks" for our business and trust. Not cool, Anthony.

Husband and I checked out this place after reading about it's opening. The article doesn't do it justice. The ice cream is on point, and I'll get to that, but the customer service was top notch. The guy at the counter took the time to explain each flavor and even let us sample each flavor. I settled on the Captain Crunch ice cream, which tasted like my childhood without the scratched up roof of my mouth like the cereal would give me. If you're looking for some unique, tasty ice cream flavors with friendly staff go here!
