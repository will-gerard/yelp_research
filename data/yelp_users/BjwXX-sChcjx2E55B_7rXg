If you can look past the giant Meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment, it's pretty wonderful... especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster, like myself.  Gourmet House of Hong Kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes I've ever found, anywhere. I don't mean a measly, mid-western, tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster, I mean a damn good, meaty, savory, juicy morsel of deliciousness.  It's served a number of ways, but I usually go for the black bean sauce style. Then, I eat like nobody's watching, vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this, and usually end up getting sauce on my face, clothing, table, neighbors, etc. Go messy, or go home.

Back when Welcome Diner was just burgers, hot dogs, and giant chocolate chip cookies served on greasy paper plates speckled with ants (or "protein sprinkles" as momma called 'em) it was simply a welcome diner. Now it's so much more than that.  Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.  My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of "flare" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.  Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.  TL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely. Bring an insatiable appetite and leave with a permasmile.

Here's a sample experience at MacAlpines:  Wow! A real, old fashioned soda parlor! Whoa, look at all this vintage stuff! Hey, check out the menu! Oh hell yeah I love this kind of candy, I haven't seen this in forever! Oh maaan 99 flavors of soda what the whaaat!   Mmm.. pina colada soda, wait, the butter pecan is even better! No, taste the margarita! Wait, they're refillable! AHHH!!!! VANILLA COKE! BUBBLEGUM! MORE BUTTER PECAN! HEY THERE'S CHOCOLATE! GIVE ME AN IRISH CREAM FLAVOR! PUT CARAMEL IN IT! ANOTHER CARAMEL, THIS TIME WITH CHOCOLATE! WE HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED THE ICE CREAM, WE NEED THIS ONE WITH ICE CREAM IN IT. MORE ICE CREAM YUM THRIFTY ICE CREAM!!!!!!!  Holy shiznit, that soda.... 'twas nothing but awesome... I don't feel so good.  *passes out in the car*  Arrives home.  *passes out for fifteen hours*  Awakens with a hangover more vicious than the Thursday following Wine Wednesdays at ASU. Remembers MacAlpines fondly while taking 3 Ibuprofen. Goes back to sleep.

Hands down, See's Candies offer the best chocolates I've ever had from a chain sweet store, ever.  Though every truffle I've had the pleasure of sampling induced the "eyes closed, head tilted smile", there are a few that hold a special place in my heart (and stomach).  1. The Walnut Square - Available in both a truffle and a candy bar, this dark chocolate coated chunk of heaven (butter caramel and English walnuts) haunts my reverie 2-3 times a week. The only problem with the bar is that you have to bite into it, meaning there are opportune moments to drool while eating. Embarrassing? Yes. Worth it? Yes. 2. Key Lime Truffle - A totally unique, decadent delight, this creamy cube of white chocolate houses a key lime cream flavored center. It's tangy, sweet, and addictive. 3. Kona Mocha - The perfect blend of texture and flavor, toasted coconut and white chocolate surround a coffee and milk chocolate truffle. If there was a coffee that tasted like this, my mornings would rock. 4. Almond Truffle - Somewhat reminiscent of an inside-out sushi roll, the roasted almonds coat the outside, followed by white chocolate, and finally smooth milk chocolate in the center. They don't really look like truffles, which makes it easy to eat, oh, say, 10 of them at a time. 5. Chelsea - The ultimate classy truffle, pecans and chocolate liquor surrounded by milk chocolate create a mini-explosion of awesome on your taste buds.  6. Scotchmallow - Available in a bar and a truffle, a layer of marshmallow and flavorful caramel are enveloped in dark chocolate. If I could put this between graham crackers I'd be a) in s'mores heaven, and b) a total glutton. 7. Dark Almonds - Technically this is just a dark almond cluster, but I'll be damned if it's not the best almond cluster I've ever had.  8. Dark Chocolate Truffle - A pure, smooth chocolate with a bit of texture, this semisweet chocolate truffle and chocolate liquor center is topped with nut crunch. It's simple, but perfect. 9/10. Mocha/Bordeaux - Both of these truffles are covered in chocolate sprinkles, which I usually hate, but for some reason, they taste amazing. The Bordeaux is a pure chocolate flavor with a hint of brown sugar, and the Mocha is chocolate-coffee (obviously) available in both milk and dark flavors.  Traveling back through my childhood by writing about these exceptional chocolates has made me realize something: these are some of the best truffles I've ever had, local or not. The price is fair (maybe too fair), the quality is evident, and the selection is grand. In fact, I'd pick these over $4.00 French truffles at a shmancy-pants chocolatier any day.

First off, thank god for somewhere in the area where a veggie burger is under $12. THANK GOD. Healthy food is made affordable and accessible at this cute, bustling little 'grocery' and for that, I thank you, LGO. Your breakfast burritos, veggie summer rolls, and nutritious salad/sandwich selection are all truly appreciated by us health-conscious folks on the go.  Second, WTF are you doing sticking your butterscotch buns and peanut butter pies and fatty chocolate ten thousand layer cakes in my face when I'm trying to get my vegan on?! COME ON. I literally played "If you could eat a whole one of these without getting sick or gaining weight, which would it be?" with my friend while waiting in line. There's that much to drool over.. and I resent all of it (promptly buries face in veggie burger and turns 180 degrees away from the pastry window... only to see The Grateful Spoon looming in the distance).  Bottom line: Lots of healthy choices, and lots that will absolutely kick-start anyone's mission to induce type-2 diabetes.  UPDATE- EVERYONE BE WARNED: The breakfast burritos are incredibly bland. Both the Venice Beach and the Chorizo Burrito taste like nothing but the salsa they're accompanied by. Nutritious? Yes. Filling? Absolutely. An adventure for the taste buds? Far from.

To all the carnivores who have been scarred by vegetarian friends brutally forcing you to "just try a bite" of a rubbery Boca burger or flavorless beans-n'-sh*t burger, know that there is hope for you yet.   LGO has perfected the veggie burger. The Shangri-La is filling, big, flavorful, healthy, and cheap. Plus, you can get it wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Take that, carbs. It also comes with a piece of fruit, so your sugar cravings will be somewhat satisfied without ordering a 6-inch cookie to-go and crying while eating the entire thing in your car.   I love that burger so much I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant.

Holy shit.  Where do I begin?   First off, "Joey's California Bistro Italian Restaurant"? Isn't that like, "Mandy's Apparel Shop Store for Clothes"?  The place was mostly empty, save for terrible, dated decor and a smattering of rather lively and vivacious flies. A waiter was screaming at a customer from the other side of the restaurant. Even when I realized they were screaming sports-oriented things, it still wasn't normal. As our waiter wheezed the specials of the day to us, we feared he was literally about to die in the middle of the word "stuffed".  Our salads consisted of romaine, three pieces of cucumber, and one tomato, cut in half. The bleu cheese dressing contained no actual cheese. I ordered tea with lemon and honey, but the honey was a "blend" made out of mostly high fructose rice syrup... is honey too rare a commodity to hunt down these days? Our dinner companion ordered lobster ravioli with shrimp. The waiter brought the lobster ravioli out, then the shrimp, separately, in a little cup. Oh, and the shrimp was BOILED. What is this, 1965? What the actual f*#&.  It'd be one thing if this place was dirt cheap, but entrees hit well over $20.  Do yourself a favor. Rather than coming here, just eat the money. Even if it's in coins.

This is how Mexican food should be served:  It should cost about five bucks.   You start with some form of tortilla, add refried beans, spanish rice, salsa, and lettuce, insert cheesey-messy-possibly-meaty-goodness and throw it all in a styrofoam container.   Then, you ravage the contents of the container until there are fork scratch marks in the styrofoam.   Thank you, Carolina's, for being one of the few, the brave, and the proud Mexican places to carry out this process with charm and elegance.

When I ask if tofu can be substituted for Kalbi, I'm not saying, "Is it possible?" Obviously it is, and that's what I want, so don't say, "No, we can't do that". Yes. Yes you can.  That micro-altercation aside, the food was overpriced and pretty bland. I (shamefully) dumped half the kimchi sauces in my Dol Pan Bibimbap (which literally translates to stone plate mixed meal.. it's composed of mushrooms, spinach, egg, bean sprouts, and carrots over rice on a hot plate-bowl), which then became palatable, but nothing special. On the upside, the vegetables were fresh and plentiful, but the rice didn't even get crispy, which is the best part of rice in hot stone dishes.. and there was no tofu to mix it with, which means I'll be going elsewhere because a) Dol Sot  is better than Dol Pan and b) No other restaurant tells a customer straight "No."

Years ago, I was deterred from visiting Liberty Market because their website loudly and proudly said, "WE ARE CHRISTIANS." Also, it's in Gilbert.  Oh, how I'd deprived myself all these years.  Their pizza and salad combo is ambrosia for my soul. The salad was fresh and great, but let's talk about the pizza... oh, man. Fresh sweet ricotta, farm veggies, incredible, thick, crispy bread, and light sauce. So nice, I'd hit it twice. Or 17 million times.  The music playing inside was awesome, so were the vibes, and the staff was nice and friendly, to boot.  This area in Gilbert is really cool, but I can't will myself to branch out when I'm in the area. I've got an addiction, and the only thing that will stave off the pizzasickness is Liberty Market.

I guess if The Good Egg was the only breakfast place around, I'd give it 3 stars, but every time someone suggests eating there, here's my thought process: How about Over Easy? D'lish? Scramble? Oh, I know, Matt's Big Breakfast! Or Daily Dose? What about Breakfast Club? Or True Food for brunch? Literally anywhere else, please Jesus, save me from the mediocrity.   The Good Egg doesn't even set the bar particularly high for its eggs.. I mean, they only have to be "Good". Unfortunately, they suck. I have never had a good egg here, ever, nor a good anything else. Maybe because everything on the healthy menu tastes like cardboard and everything not on the healthy menu tastes like diabetes... but seriously. Sorry, establishment, but I've eaten at you about seven times now (against my will) and you are frustrating me with your lack of effort.  Perhaps if the food was incredibly inexpensive (like how it tastes), I'd see the merit in eating here once in a while, for convenience's sake. The thing is... it's not even cheap. Plus, I can definitely make everything on their menu at home. Here's my recommendation: If you hate cooking as much as you hate eating interesting food, The Good Egg will suffice.

They have chia seeds. They sell raw cacao powder. There are 11 kinds of nut butter. Homeopathic remedies line the walls.  If any of that gets you...  a) inspired b) excited c) slightly hot and bothered   ...then definitely go.   Now, if you have no idea what I just said... stick with Fry's.

If you're looking for the diametric opposite of Sopporro or Pearl, come to the light side. Enter Hiro.    It's void of a club scene, the quality of the food is stellar, and while it's not cheap, it's justifiable. Their udon, sashimi, salads, and rolls are all delicious, fresh, and expertly prepared. This is the place where my friends from Japan go to eat when they want Japanese food... that's right, no cougars or scenesters. Mostly Asians (always a great sign at sushi place), couples, and families. Oh, and their green tea is fantastic, as is their sake selection.  Hiro really knows its stuff when it comes to Japanese food, especially when compared to the other options in Scottsdale. I'd give them 5 stars, but the prices and total lack of atmosphere renders me a standard fan, not quite a cult follower.

Come for the caffeine fix, stay for several other things (including, but not limited to:)  - the owner, who I'm strategically trying to adopt into my own family. - the heavy, comforting, granny's-house-reminiscent ceramic mugs. -  almond milk and outlets, or chicken soup for the hipster soul. - consistently respectful "inside voices" (circa 3rd grade) used by clientele.  - treasure trove of board games that you're not going to play, but that you enjoy knowing you could. - the feeling of peaceful privacy that is nonexistent at institutions like Lux or Cartel.  Oh, yeah, and the coffee's pretty good, too. When I need a coffee shop without that 21st-century coffee shop vibe, Gold Bar is my go-to.

This food was so good, I'm not even mad that Persia no longer exists. Persian Garden Cafe is enough for me.   First off, there's plenty of meat and seafood on the menu - but - everything can be made vegan. That's right. You can all come out of hiding now. You're safe here.  I shared the dolmeh and falafel plate with a friend and was satisfied, but still found room for dessert. Yeah, I've got my priorities straight. It came with four big, crisp, spiced falafel and three FRESH, steamed domlehs. (To anyone who has only had the displeasure of trying a canned dolmeh: now is your time. Feed.) That may appear to be enough to serve one person, but with the heaps of saffron rice, brown lentil-currant-other-tasty-things rice, tahini, tomatoes, and huge basket of flat bread it came with, it was more than enough for two.  For dessert, we ordered a slice of carrot cake and chocolate cheesecake. They're both vegan, along with the saffron rice pudding and pumpkin pie on the dessert menu... both of which I'll probably review in the near future. The carrot cake was huge, super sweet, heavily spiced, studded with raisins and walnuts and topped with a dollop of magical cream un-cheese frosting. The chocolate cheesecake was my favorite, probably because it was doused with dark chocolate chips, had a chewy, creamy center, and a crunchy, cookie crust. Last I checked, those are the only things I want from a dessert, ever.  Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap, but the ambiance is warm and pleasant (not to mention, great for groups), the food is fresh, homemade and delicious, and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake. If that doesn't make this place worth a shot, I don't know what does.

Look, I'm not saying Mi Comida created a wormhole in the space-time continuum, but I am also not saying otherwise.  Step inside... climate and humidity levels immediately shift to match that of a few thousand miles south of here.   Take a seat and make yourself at home, which should be easy - a warm, smiley, Spanish-speaking only couple is running the show. Don't be intimidated, they work around helplessly bad accents and treat everyone like they belong. There's no exclusivity, just love, tradition, and things getting lost in translation. Check your watch a moment later, only to realize it's been two-and-a-half hours.  Don't worry, your massive chalice of fresh, spicy ceviche will stay icy cold the whole time. Your Ecuadorian spaghetti & chicken will stay perfectly piping. The shrimp stew won't congeal or cool. Your Tropical will be fizzy down to the last sip. I have no explanation for this. If you're not convinced you *might* be in South America, try a tamale or three... and once you've been swayed, try three more.  Mi Comida is as authentic as it gets... so authentic that I'm not sure why I end up in a strip mall in Arizona every time I walk outside. Whatever the case may be, prepare to exit the wormhole impossibly full and possibly sleepy. It's all part of the magic.

The event seems as if passed in another lifetime, yet simultaneously, I recall it as if it were only but a moment ago.  Clear as ever, it haunts my reverie and dashes my tourist-y vintage soda shop dreams to smithereens... nothing more than ancient affections, now turned to dust.  What could possibly tarnish my fond childhood recollections of the Sugar Bowl?  Him. He sat there, idle, fondling a morsel of something. Suddenly, he was off... advancing towards the counter at lightning speed, straight towards my prized possession.   He approached it without hesitation, and before I knew it, a cockroach had crawled up my sundae.  'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.... save for when you unknowingly loved something infested with cockroaches. Then, it becomes debatable.

This is a carnivore, herbivore and omnivore's mutual heaven. As long as you enjoy flavor, you'll enjoy Lalibela's. We ordered the vegetarian platter, which comfortably fed four of us (and allowed for some mindless stew-stained injera noshing afterward). Favorites included the Misir Wat (spicy red lentil stew), Shiro Wat (a garlic-y, onion-y pea mash stew), and Yekik Alicha (yellow split peas with onions and tumeric).   Of course, scooting injera from stew to stew, scooping up everything at once also seemed to be a pretty successful maneuver, even though it mixed the individual stew flavors. Everyone else really liked when I did that (not really). Do I regret it? No.  I do have one regret though, which I shall reconcile upon my next visit, and that is that I did not leave Lalibela wearing a cloak made entirely from injera. But hey, that's why there's next time.

Anyone who asks, "are you a vegan to lose weight?" should come to Green and eat their words. And everything else.  In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's "Food you can eat that I actually like." Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.  Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.  On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place.

On the culinary horizon beyond frills, shtick and gimmicks lies Chuckbox. The sign out front perpetually reads "over 278 sold." The menu is simple. Cash only. The condiments are DIY. You get punched if you use the word seasonal, local, or organic. The great big one is both great and big.   Undeniably, it's a wild world out there, with many a burger to tempt you. One day, you'll be ready to settle down... no games, no pizzazz, just pure, unadulterated sustenance. Chuckbox will be there to welcome you with open (cafeteria line-style, endearingly apathetic) arms.

Just look at the breakdown of this thing: http://eater.com/archives/2013/08/28/eater-elements-the-rosa-at-pizzeria-bianco.php  Salty, intense parmesan-reggiano, rosemary, red onions, and smokey pistachios are inconsistently, but uniformly, distributed over some damn good crust, no sauce allowed, for one hell of a taste-bud roller coaster.  I know you want it. You know you want it.

Of course you can get almond milk in your iced latte. Of course the waitress is 90 lbs and wearing a plaid headband with a pixie haircut. Of course everyone who needs to be seen working publicly is there with a laptop, and naturally there are no menus and everyone knows to go in the back...  But, fear not the Eau de Hipster that emanates from this lovely place!  There's also a gym buddy group drinking tea, my mom and I on a couch in the corner drinking coffee, parents ordering pastries for their toddlers, a husband and wife sharing a scone, and random dudes at the bar chatting up smiling strangers.  Just because it's a hipster joint, doesn't mean it's not an everyone else joint, too. And besides, almond milk is the shiznit in iced lattes, so let's just embrace it.

First off, the fact that there's an independent "coffee is actually our priority" kind of coffee shop in this part of town is... well, refreshingly wonderful.  High Points:  - The drinks have been consistently good, from the sweetened, blended frozen nonsense to the espresso shots. - There's a very local feel (art, photography, mismatched furniture, etc.) - Employees are prompt and friendly, but not contrived or creepy. - There are comfortable couches for studying, using the wi-fi, or being a hipster upon. - It smells great.  Eh: - It can be loud.. not so loud so that you can drown out your friend's voice, but loud enough so that becoming deeply engaged in Hamlet might prove a difficult task. - Food. It's as if they poured their soul into the beverages and the food came as an afterthought. Unless you're going into hypoglycemic shock or your stomach is eating itself, skip the real food and order a pastry. They're huge, and not aesthetically appealing, but at least they're tasty.  Nutshell review: Get the drink, skip the food, stay awhile.

The almond milk latte is the best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had, I said it's the f**king best.  Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make up on, that's when it's the tastiest, I hope it don't take that wrong.  But in all seriousness, it's fantastic - strong without being bitter, creamy without inducing a weight gain epidemic (I'm glaring at you, Starbucks), and it sure as hell wakes me up enough to put on real clothes instead of wearing sweat pants all day.

This is not a place for eating things. It's more like a basic lounge with emergency food and drinks only to be consumed in the event of imminent death due to starvation.  I don't mind hanging out here and ordering a tea in order to say, "I respect the convenience of your establishment, here's two bucks so I can kick it for a while", but literally every drink or food item I've tasted is slightly worse than the memory of a  brownie I ate on an airplane two years ago.   All the food stuff comes from some external source, and the internal source of drinks does not give a single fack about you. They don't have a kitchen, and the staff is pretty much just teenage girls who wanna talk to each other about hooking up 'n stuff lyk that, ya know? Plus, I saw one of them sneeze on a sandwich, look around, and then pretend nothing happened. That kind of irks me, considering "snot" has yet to be listed as a condiment option.  If you expect nothing besides a good location for gathering friends, or using wi-fi, you'll be satisfied.

I broke the first rule of restauranting. I went somewhere named after their specialty item, and ordered something else. That's right... no pasties for me.  But, I have an excuse. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding - homemade bread, baked in chocolate brandy sauce until crispy on the outside, served warm with vanilla ice cream. Who looks and that and doesn't think, "I want that inside of me" immediately? Nobody.  When I ordered it, the waiter replied with, "You know what makes this even better? If you ordered a shot of Rumple Minze (peppermint liqueur) and dipped your spoon in it before every bite." As if it needed to be better.  Now I might never get a pasty from Cornish Pasty Co., but gaddamnit, rules were made to be broken. And warm chocolate bread and butter pudding, alongside melting vanilla ice cream soaked in booze, was meant to be inside me.

I grew up in the South, eating fried chicken with butter on butter with a side of buttered biscuits, and yet I truly dislike how buttery these cookies taste.  Considering I'm a total cookie fiend and can't even come up with a variety that I dislike, it should be relatively impossible to deter me from eating cookies. However, I've ended up at Urban Cookies a few times now and always find myself wondering, why am I wasting precious, precious stomach space on these when I could just trek on over to LGO's bakery and go nuts?  I respect them conceptually and appreciate the idea of a gourmet cookie, but when it comes to the actual product, I'm not buying it (figuratively, because literally I already bought it, of course).  Give me more flavor, more chocolate(!), more chewy substance and I'll be back.  Until then, I guess I'm just not Paula Deen enough for this place. Le sigh.

If someone asked me my deepest desire while I was sleeping, there's a 94% chance that I'd mumble "The House-Style Veggie Burger with grilled onions instead of feta, please".  It's been about a month since I had the pleasure of ravaging this for lunch, but it hasn't left my mind. Even though D'lish was out of buns, the toasted sourdough bread they put it on was good enough for me to consider asking for that instead from now on.  First off, it's only $8.50 for a meal that will keep me full for at least 6 hours after. The burger itself (a mix of quinoa, black beans, and some other nommy things) is massive. It's the kind of burger that squishes out of the side of the bread when you bite into it. Awesome. It's topped with all kinds of fresh veggies, and then the bread is slathered with cucumber sauce on one side and pesto on the other. It's unreasonably good. Sound like a lot? It is. It might be 1,000 calories... but you know what? It's 1,000 calories of really freakin' delicious stuff.

Hoping to calm a tempestuous woman?  Do something unscrupulous and looking for a way to say, "I'm sorry" without saying it?  In search of a new aphrodisiac? (Uh, okay weirdo...) That time of the month?   Get a box of passion fruit truffles. Bitches love passion fruit truffles.

Dim lighting. Fleet Foxes. Beautiful upstairs seating that almost seems secret. Band of Horses. Benches that are less cushy than you anticipate them to be. The Shins. Black board specials, just because they look cool. Beirut. $13 vegetable dishes.   Intimidated yet? Fight through the angst. Once you take your first bite of food, all the hullabaloo will be well worth it.  Order the forbidden rice bowl. Tell them to make it vegan (the vegetables are usually cooked in a bit of butter)... after all, you're a pseudo-hipster for the evening, and it's fantastic. If you're depressed by the idea of black rice as your main carbohydrate, the flat breads are taste-gasmic. That crust... the things I'd do for unlimited amounts of that flat bread crust. Top it off with figs and ricotta, and there's no way I'm passing up a square or two... or seven. If you're still not sold on the idea of carb-loading, the salmon "superfood" is delicious and nutritious, and who's not into a little super(food)iority now and then?  But on to the main event... the chocolate stout cake + spiced ice cream + espresso ganache was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It was just so damn... moist. There, I said it. Moist. Moist. Moist. Ew. But really, yum. If caffeine, chocolate and alcohol don't suit your fancy (wimp), the cheesecake in a jar was equally delightful. Cookie crust + strawberry compote + cream + cheesecake. Layered. In a jar. Who thought of that? Someone with adorable thoughts, that's who.   And let's be honest, you've earned dessert. I mean... you ordered a healthy, vegan entree over the french onion cheeseburger, right? Right. Of course you did.

Dear St. Francis,  If you were a stripper and 5-stars were dollar bills, I'd be makin' it rain on you right now.  Thank you for a brunch feast that shall go down in history: consistency, top-notch quality, versatility, and prompt, friendly service, all to the sounds of Radiohead, The Black Keys, and Fleet Foxes.  My sister and I began by splitting the homemade buttermilk biscuit, which came out on two plates (without us asking), each half-biscuit topped with a sunny side up egg and doused in creamy, delicious, herbed onion gravy. I could've sworn I was somewhere directly below the Mason-Dixon line every time I took a bite. Absolutely nail'd it.  Next up was the iron skillet pancake - crisp on the outside, thick, warm and fluffy on the inside, studded with dark chocolate, topped with spiced apples, creme fraiche, and a light drizzle of maple syrup. Either this is a pancake, or those things I've been calling pancakes my whole life are pancakes, but not both. Regardless, this is the new standard to which all pancakes shall be held.   Lastly, I inquired about ordering the smoked salmon flatbread, even though it wasn't on the brunch menu. They made it happily, and we demolished it, happily. St. Francis actually makes the best crust I've ever had, and topped with cheese, lemon, capers, onion, creme fraiche and smoked salmon... it makes a bagel, lox & cream cheese look like an inedible compilation of garbage.  All in all, each dish was incomparable to the next, but of equal, fantastic quality and taste. Picking a favorite would be damn near impossible, so I think I'll just come back and order blindly off the menu, because St. Francis can do it all, and they do it best.  *throws a handful of singles in the air*

Since you probably don't know what to expect... here's what to expect:   Vibes: The owners are exceptionally sweet and friendly (As in, free lemonade and halva cake?! What the deuce!) There's no strong overwhelming Arab or Israeli influence, just a perfect, little mecca of all things authentically Middle Eastern, from Labneh to imported Pareve chocolate spread.  Location: A funky fresh exterior covered in graphic art, like World Peace signs, baklava, camels and snakes... and generally sparse parking.  Food: A surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate. We ordered the vegetarian sampler, which is a solid one-person sized lunch consisting of a pita, four falafel, a spinach pie, four little dolmas, baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, and tzatziki. The falafelim were better than the ones I had in Jerusalem. So blasphemous... yet so crispy.  Other: They have sheep's milk cheese. That is a big deal. Also, their iced tea and lemonade are both delicious, meaning the potential for the perfect Arnold Palmer is right at your fingertips.  In a word: Unique. This is the most accommodating, authentic, friendly, and, dare I say, seemingly neutral Middle Eastern restaurant and market I have yet to encounter. If you're not convinced of MEBAD's worthiness by now... dir balak. Now go eat! B'tayavon!

Cafe Nordstrom has been saving me from food court doom for years. If you're eating in the mall and you're not eating here, you've made a terrible mistake, my friend.   Everything is consistently delicious and well prepared, standouts include the angel hair pasta, shrimp salad, and tuscan salmon. Do yourself a favor and come home without a Panda Express food baby of guilt and sodium and enjoy some fresh cooked awesome instead.

First of all, shame on Sprinkles for taking a beautiful, precious morsel like the cupcake and turning it corporate. The first flavor I taste upon biting into a cupcake should be love, otherwise, why did I just pay $3.50 for half a cake slice that's shaped like a circle? I WANT TO FEEL SPECIAL, THAT'S WHY.  After befriending an employee, it took about a week for me to try every flavor, since they take them home after work. Carrot cake and peanut butter chocolate were the best-tasting, but both are so dense and sweet that the cupcake and frosting are essentially indistinguishable.   Adding to the sugar-fat intensity is their proportion (cake:frosting = 2:3). Considering that the Red Velvet cupcake, sans frosting, is 497 calories, you're consuming over half a day's worth of fat by indulging in a store-bought, frosted cupcake. Either way, if you manage to finish one, you will be sick... and you will raise your risk of cardiac arrest significantly (surprise!)  The final thing that grinds my gears about Sprinkles is that you can make them yourself. They literally sell you the mix so that you can create them in the comfort of your own home. Why are you paying $3.50 for cupcakes that emerged from a box mix in the first place? That doesn't taste like love! That tastes like a 21st century bake sale. I'll take one order of real food, with a side of integrity, please.

After a few good cocktails (albeit none too noteworthy) I started chatting up the server about drink things, which he pleasantly confessed were not his specialty. He got the bartender over to our table, and we started talking about NoLa and the like. Because it was a slow evening, he said he'd give a Ramos Gin Fizz "the old college try" for me. He actually made me one the right way, and it tasted like nothing I've ever had before or since.  Some background on why this is dope: Henry C. Ramos invented the Ramos gin fizz in 1888 at his bar, the Imperial Cabinet Saloon on Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was originally called the New Orleans Fizz, and is one of the city's most famous cocktails. Before Prohibition, the drink's popularity and exceptionally long 12-minute mixing time[5] had over 20 bartenders working at the Imperial at once making nothing but the Ramos Gin Fizz - and still struggling to keep up with demand. During the carnival of 1915, 32 staff were on at once, just to shake the drink.  For funky, creative craft cocktails? Perhaps a more urban venue. But for staff with passion, arm strength, and knowledge about the cocktails of yesteryear? Jade Bar it is.

I have a hard time accepting how boring Sushi Brokers is, but I feel like an utter fool for not predicting the outcome of our evening based solely on the name of the establishment. The food was nothing impressive. It's not terrible, but with places like Hiro and Roka Akor in the valley, it doesn't stack up. They don't seem to care that much about the quality of the food, perhaps because it's reasonable to assume that you'll be drinking and distracted, anyway.  My recommendation is thus: If you have recognized yourself as a very white person (not physically, but mentally) who would feel uncomfortable in an environment hardly reminiscent of a typical steakhouse, this'll do you just fine. If you're a discerning sushi connoisseur, however, continue on your quest. Search on, food snobs, search on.

Come for the endless variety of BBQ, stay because you can't make a decision. Realize the selection of sides is equally expansive, and just sit there eating biscuits with apple butter until someone tells you to get the tri-tip sandwich with a side of cornbread.  I understand why people are lamenting about how stupid the prices are, but come on, y'all. You could totally share a meal with someone here and leave satisfied (as long as you eat yer biscuits.) Now, now, I know what you're thinking, "We don't take kindly to sharers 'round these parts..." But put down your pitchforks, because the portions are proportionally reasonable to their stupid prices.  Lucille's lands at 2 stars for good biscuit and cornbread game, solid tri-tip and peanut slaw, and subpar brisket and mac 'n' cheese. In another region, I might toss Lucy a fourth star, but anything less than the best in this BBQ-splattered town just won't win my stomacheart.

Warning: If you've ever been called a "cracker", consider yourself strongly Republican, have excellent hygiene, or are highly carnivorous, leave now. Just go. I'll wait.  For whoever is left, here's the deal: This is a totally-indie-hipster-vegan-chill-sesh kind of place. You can interpret that as you will, but if eau de scenester and staff with disconcerting facial hair bothers you, leave now.   Personally, I enjoy it, save for the ridiculous people, art, and "I'm-trying-so-hard-that-I'm-not-trying" vibe emanating from the ridiculous people. If you subtract all the weird hullabaloo, it's just a casual place to get some coffee and tasty noms. I'd say the food is slightly healthier than Green, but not healthy enough to be considered "one of those sh*tty vegan places".  The painted exterior and overall decor give Conspire an urban vibe that's pretty hard to find in Phoenix, save for in this little nugget of town. Plus, the place is split up into a few rooms, so privacy is not only possible, but plausible. Hooray!  On to the edible portion... the aztec end burrito is a good deal. It's a tortilla with vegan cheese, rice, beans, and a few veggies that comes with a side of hummus and flax chips. The only issue was that the food took 30 minutes... I mean it was First Fridays, but regardless, people sometimes get murdered when I'm really hungry and feeling neglected.  I strongly recommend the vegan doughnuts with a black coffee. It's like cop food, only you're too cool to be a cop, you little pseudo anarchist vegan, you. If you'd like to wade into the waters of the modern hipster, check this place out. But like I said, if you fit into any of the upper criteria, speed away in your BMW to a trustworthy, popular chain that sells monogrammed mugs and only has one kind of milk.

Expect top quality sushi at a "top quality sushi" price.  The hamachi nigiri and yellowtail sashimi were both impeccably prepared and paired with complimentary toppings, and the ratio of fish to rice is about 7:1, which is always refreshing. The unagi roll was a bit chewier than I'm used to, but delicious in it's own right (although the unagi sashimi was definitely better). Even better was the spicy tuna roll - the fish is exceptionally tender. It makes the notion that the same species ends up emanating stench from sandwiches in children's lunch boxes seem impossible.   The best of the best award goes to the seared sesame salmon nigiri, which is the most melt-in-your-mouth fish experience known to man, as well as the crispy prawn roll, which isn't heavy or fried, but still so deliciously, well... crispy.  Is it worth it? Yes, even though they charge a lot, they don't skimp on the fish, and it'll probably be the best quality sushi you have in Arizona. Would I come here again? Maybe, but only if I get ahold of another Groupon.

Hi, I'd like a decaf iced Americano with a side of sorry I don't have tribal tattoos, gauges, and a pseudo-lumberjack beard.  In all seriousness, though, Cartel is a pretty cool place to hang out and get school work done, despite the fact that it may be too cool for school. The environment is open, spacious, and definitely the kind of place where I feel like I'm paying three bucks to park myself somewhere conducive to productivity for a few hours, rather than for the actual coffee.   You might as well say "make me a drink that's stronger than me," because that's essentially anything at Cartel. I'm sure it hurts so good if you're looking for a caffeine rush, but if you drink decaf, the high-intensity, bitter brew is basically like drinking an O'Doul's - neither effective, nor genuinely enjoyable. However, for the general college population, Cartel provides all the resources necessary to help you pound out that essay/assignment/tumblr post/article as seamlessly as possible.

Perhaps on your excursion to Scratch, you had a triple chocolate stomach ache or some sort of fruit tart mouthgasm in mind, which totally makes sense. It's basically the closest thing to a (euro-hipster) patisserie in town.  I, however, wanted a salmon burger. Hear me out: 'twas fantastic. The patty itself was incredibly tender and m-word (say "voiced" but replace "v" with "m"... god, I hate that word) and paired flawlessly with the coriander sauce and coconut cream that accompanied it. I'd definitely rank it in my top 10 anything-but-ham-burger list.   But, the surprising aspects of Scratch don't stop there. They offer a completely vegan cheese burger topped with mushrooms, cucumbers, avocado, peppers and tahini, as well as vegan soups and salads. A butter-and-eggs bakery, doling out vegan entrees? Oh no they didn't (but actually they did) and you can color me impressed. Now, if only my sorry excuse for a wallet could handle the admiration I have for your food...  I didn't buy from the pastry window, but I inquired about nutritional information, to which they replied, "We don't have it listed... probably because it's really bad for you, honestly (chuckle.)" And you know what? That's the best damn answer I've ever gotten from a dessert counter. Thank you for your salmon patties, your vegan food, and your honesty, Scratch.

Two vegans and two vegetarians waltzed into 24 carrots at about 7 p.m., chattering about facetious things - colleges, boys, clothes, food. After one look at the menu, they fell silent, faces scrunched in determination, attempting to narrow down the plethora of options before them. To make matters worse (but actually better), breakfast was served all day, so between the lunch, specials, juices, smoothies, baked goods, and breakfast... the selection seemed virtually endless. Our cashier/server was polite and incredibly patient as we asked a large number of unnecessary questions, frantically attempting to rationalize our menu-oriented decisions.   After about 10 minutes had passed, I was still torn between the french toast and the BLT, so we agreed to order the french toast as an appetizer for the table. Thank the flying spaghetti monster we did. This may win the 'best classic french toast that ever was' award, vegan or not. It tastes like a cross between brioche and challah (butter bread and egg bread?), so I'm rather befuddled in regards to how they achieved that consistency, sans butter or eggs. Whatever, it's probably best I just stuff my mouth full of fresh fruit and warm, maple-y french toast and don't ask questions, anyway.  The BLT ended up being satisfactory, but from what I read online, I was expecting more. I don't remember tasting onions, avocado, cucumber, or aioli, so if it was there somewhere... I missed it. My friend disliked her tofu breakfast burrito, and I found it somewhat bland myself, but we brought it home and my boyfriend ate the entire thing in five minutes flat. However, quinoa tabooli was delicious, as was the tikka masala we received after our meal (thanks, Sasha, you rock!). Ethnic food is definitely a go at 24 Carrots.  For dessert, we shared a chocolate cake doughnut. It didn't stay together like a real cake doughnut, but it was much better than one... more like a ring of dense, chocolate cake. We also had the pleasure of trying an experimental raw cheesecake. It tasted a lot like chia seed-y, vanilla bean panna cotta with a bottom layer of delicious crust. Needless to say, everyone loved it (thanks, Daniel, you rock!) We also may have donated a dollar to charity in exchange for a mini chocolate cupcake. All worth it.  On the whole, unless you LOVE tofu, I recommend the sweet breakfast options. The one thing that's disappointing about this menu is that the entire savory selection of breakfast is tofu-based. However, with options like homemade granola, french toast, and maca oatmeal, I think I'll survive. Top that off with an awesome, relaxed atmosphere and the most amiable staff around, and you've got an all-around pleasant experience. I'll definitely have try 24 Carrots again... something tells me I won't get a full feel for the place until maybe my 35th visit, which I have no problem with.

I have never had an over-the-top and deliciously decadent breakfast that doesn't leave me feeling guilty, nauseated or sleepy afterwards.... until now.  Victory was delivered in the form of carrot cake pancakes. They are, for lack of better terminology, the bee's knees. The butterfly's shins. The wasp's ankles. You get the idea. Two fluffy pancakes studded with thick carrot ribbons, spices, and a delicious dose of sweetness independent of the maple syrup and fresh fruit they were served with. These are better than carrot cake... and I don't consider too many things in this world better than carrot cake.  On a very mildly unpleasant note, one cake was slightly undercooked in the middle. However, I have no fear of vegan pancake batter and proceeded to shove the entire thing in my mouth anyway. I washed that down with a "field of greens" juice (it tastes like it has the power to cure hundreds of ailments), and deemed myself full and satisfied.  Then, I noticed a little sliver of pie sitting in the fridge. Just a sad, single sliver. I had to inquire.. it looked so lonesome. Turns out it was chocolate caramel turtle pie. Vegan, raw, gluten-free, chocolate caramel turtle pie with a nut crust, salted caramel sauce, pepitas and pecans on top. I don't need to explain what happened next, just know that it was beautiful. Worth every one of the 650 pennies I shelled out for it.  It's been seven hours since I've eaten and I'm still not hungry. With the quality ingredients that 24 Carrots puts into all their dishes, it's no surprise that juice, two pancakes and half a slice of pie has sustained me until dinnertime. Oh, 24 Carrots, your wholesome goodness will surely lure me in again soon.

The fact that there's a hippy-dippy herb and tea house that seems like it's straight out of Sedona, smack dab in a shopping center in Phoenix, never fails to surprise and impress me.  Chakra 4 offers a totally unique experience. It's not strictly vegan, but everything can be made vegan. Unlike every other vegan restaurant in the area, it's not about comfort food or proving that vegan food tastes like "normal food". They don't do fake meat and sauces, but instead, focus on vegetables, legumes, nuts spreads, and herbs.   If you're unaccustomed to raw food, the menu may seem pretty foreign to you, but still allows for exploration of more nutritious food without any flavors that are too out of the ordinary (unless you only eat fast food). For health aficionados, though, an eatery that leaves you feeling better than when you walked in is gratefully received and appreciated.   My currents favorites include The Hercules, a black bean burrito with sweet potatoes, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, guacamole, and vegan or jack cheese, and the Mediterranean Wrapsody, a sun dried tomato wrap filled with greens, tomato, olives, walnuts, feta, red onion, and raw sun-dried tomato cashew spread. Definitely the more health-nut tasting of the two, this hearty wrap leaves me fully beyond full, but never sick.  If you start feeling like you might not have room for dessert, buck up. The chocolates are amazing. All the truffles are naturally sweetened, dark and rich. If you're feeling adventurous, try a raw dessert. Warning: the raw desserts are so filling that they can actually serve as a meal. If you want to try a few things, either go with a group, or prepare to take a lot home.  While Chakra 4 may not be suited for everyone's tastes, it's definitely a must-try at least once.

After months of battling Israeli street food cravings and refusing to eat Middle Eastern food in the US, I finally gave in. This place was recommended to me by Israelis, so I figured an Israeli recommendation was the next best thing to eating actual Israeli food again. I was correct.  The people are super friendly, and they don't give a shiz that the place is a total dive because the food will speak for itself (until you inhale it). It's all made right in front of you, the ingredients are authentic, it's cheap, and everything is slightly too delicious to be considered healthy. I was immediately transported back to the streets of Jerusalem, and all was well in the land of my stomach.  I'd recommend ordering a falafel wrap or a gyro, depending upon your carnivorous inclinations. Both will rock your world. If you're vegan, the falafel has some kind of ranch-tahini thing going on, so just ask them to leave off the ranch bit and you're good to go. Then, ravage your tin foil-wrapped treasure with the passion of a thousand suns.

Order the Chicken and Waffles. "Oh that's like Lo-Lo's." No it's not. Stop that right now.  Lo-Lo's:Daily Dose = McDonalds:Delux burger. Are both popular? Yes.  Are both selling the same variety of food? Yes. Is the dish at the first establishment consistently better only if the consumer is 100% stoned? Yes. Similarities end there.  These waffles are actually a cornbread hybrid, topped with green chili, shredded chicken, charred corn stew, a cream sauce, tortilla strips and avocado. (Thank you pagan god of soul food. Thank you.)

I walked over to our table with a few flavors of ice cream to sample, and when my mom tasted the pumpkin pie flavor, she asked, "What kind of frozen dessert is this? I mean, I know it's pumpkin pie... but what is it?" Basically, it's just much fluffier and thicker than standard ice cream, almost like a thick mousse, to the point where it's more of a tangent off of ice cream than anything Haagen-Daaz or Breyer's would recognize. I'd say that's a pretty good thing, though.   Truthfully, the ice creams weren't flavorful enough for me... But holy hell, the lavosh pizza was above and beyond the pinnacle my most flavorful fantasies. Garlic, caramelized onions, chevre, arugula, crispy, nutty, heavenly.. again, nothing Domino's or Papa John's would recognize, but that's definitely a good thing.  Consensus? If you have some sort of ice cream deficiency, order it. Otherwise, just order between seven and twelve pizzas and call it a day. A really freakin' good day.

This place is both adorable AND affordable... I can't (and I won't) believe it's actually located in Scottsdale.   Cookies for $0.40. Fresh salad topped with a giant salmon fillet for $7.40. Paninis galore for $7.80. I know, this all sounds far too reasonable to be true, but it's the real deal.   The Gardener (aka ratatouille panini) was a major hit amongst everyone, and it's meat and dairy-free! Health and French food in the same place? This place just gets more and more unbelievable.   Between the atmosphere, pricing, and food, Cafe Paris seems like it's in a location far from, "somewhere near where I take my car in for maintenance." Cheaper than France, more authentic than Scottsdale, and tastier than anything else I can get for less than eight bucks.

This is possibly the most entertaining store I've ever set foot in.  Every time I go to Smeek's, I'm drinking cream soda, wearing a finger tentacle, holding a bag full of vegan chocolate bars, and taking pictures in a photobooth, within minutes. Plus, It's so hipster I can't even convey how hipster it is (except maybe to say that there are a plethora of mustache-themed items and vintage candies lining the walls). Either way, it's trendiness and gourmet treats make it just as much fun for big kids, if not more fun, than it is for little kids.  The only reason I don't give Smeek's that coveted fifth star, even though I only have good things to say... is because it's overpriced. If penny candies weren't dead before, they are now. Get ready to whip out a $20 if you want a decent amount of sugar and a photobooth session. If you venture into the novelties, just put it on the credit card and stop thinking about prices altogether. Don't be completely off-put by the thought of pricey fun things, though. I have you know that that finger tentacle was worth every penny.

For 16 dollars you can get: a) fat b) seafood that appears to have been stolen from a chinese buffet c) obnoxious and slow service d) the joy of spending your money in a corporate shit hole that doesn't care about your food when you could be at a real restaurant e) shame  I'm a big fan of going out to eat, and I usually tip well.. but I went because a friend had her birthday there and decided to pretend I was drunk the entire time and tip in seashells. Desperate times, man. Desperate times.

Why am I giving four stars to a place with veggie burritos worthy of only three?   Well.... EVERYTHING ABOUT REVO MADE ME HAPPY.  - Free chips and salsa galore. With free refills. Did I mention the word "free?"  - Friendly, spunky staff. I was indecisive about choosing a salsa, so they gave me two of both kinds.  - Hooks for purses and coats under the tables - innovative, classy and functional.  - 100% vegan, filling veggie burritos for seven bucks.  - Funkyfresh decor that's reminiscent of... well, nothing really. It's all over the place. In a nice way.  - Bathrooms with life-sized images of scantily-clad beach babes and guys on the walls.   - Without my asking, waiter took my reusable water bottle and filled it for me before I left.   That, my comrades, coworkers, and esteemed colleagues, is how you earn an extra star.

I would do bad things for a plate of Hula's Jerk fish.  (It can also be made with tofu, chicken or pork)  I'd probably lick their jerk sauce off of an old shoe.  I'd share a johnny cake with a prison inmate if it meant I got to eat the other half.  I'd go on a date with a homeless man as long as we came here.  If I had to, I'd pour the entire dish in my purse and eat it out with chopsticks.

Honey vanilla latte! Honey vanilla latte! Why am I cheer leading for coffee? Because the honey vanilla latte is freaking delicious! (And rather full of caffeine, apparently...)  The staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful, and the clothing & accessory store in the adjacent space is fun to browse around in while you're waiting for a... oh, I don't know... honey vanilla latte?  The only thing better than the honey vanilla latte was the stray kitten I found outside. I named him Giant. So, even if you don't like coffee, you might find something else awesome in/around this place. When I say that, I mean something like a cool ring next door or a tasty nosh.. I think the cat discovery was kind of an anomaly. Regardless, the vibes are all around pleasant, and Giant is worth checking out (even if you don't find a cat... which you may not want. In that case, I recommend a pastry.)

Finding your favorite cuisine is great. Finding your favorite dish is monumental. Finding your favorite version of your favorite dish is monument-al, shrine-al, temple-al, nativity scene-al.   Factor in that it's one a.m. and I'm basically just weeping on the floor of this little Korean joint in a strip mall.   Why? Because Kalbi dol sot bibim bap. So damn crispy. So flavorful. So fresh, 'n' so clean. So egg. The greatest wall of crispy rice action I've ever known... I'm a one-dolsot woman now.

People came and went. They picked up to-go orders, paid their bills, got on with life. They loved, had children, died, were reincarnated as sea creatures.   I just sat there. No menu, no water, no service. I was wearing a shirt and shoes, too.  Finally, we were the only people left in the restaurant, and the servers just started cleaning other tables. No menus. No waters. No acknowledgment of being alive. Considering I wasn't wearing my invisibility cloak, I don't really get what was going on.  I won't go back, but if I did, they probably wouldn't even realize I was there... *cries under invisibility cloak*

Alert: every dish that involves sauce is bubbling tar pit of sodium and sugar. You'll need to reserve three hours to nap afterwards, and maybe another hour for rolling around, glassy eyed and confused about where you are.  The crispy tofu pad thai, tangerine shrimp, and soft shell crab curry are definitely tasty... but I'd rather down a triple scoop sundae if I'm going to go into a food coma afterwards, regardless.

As someone suffering from terrible portion control-itis, Thai food usually has the magical ability to make me sick. With it's signature Americanized heavy sauces and entree portions that could feed a small village, disaster seems to be lurking in the stark, awkward corners of most Thai restaurants in the area. Thai Basil, however, is a different, much more pleasant, story.  First off, the food is fresh. As in, the sauce added to the flavor of the food, not composed the entire dish, which I'd say is a feat when dabbling in Asian food in America. Even the sauce tasted fresh - light, but rich with herbs and spices. We had the yellow curry and the signature Thai Basil dish with tofu, and both were brimming with vegetables and herbs, plus they came with enough rice to make a lunch-de-leftovers the following day. Economic friendliness points!   The atmosphere is ideal for a Thai restaurant: much more comfortable and stylish than most places. The warm lighting and secluded seating make it a great date spot or place to take friends. Versatility points!   Oh, and it's not overpriced... I always resent shelling out fifteen bucks for a vegetarian entree that yields most of its caloric value from rice. Thai Basil offers main courses (that are quite large, but not intimidatingly so) starting at around eight bucks. All in all, if you're in the market for Thai, I highly recommend taking a trip to Thailand. If that's not an option, Thai Basil is your best local bet.

She is sweet, spicy, smooth, and exotic.  But don't talk about her like that, because she is La Santisima, and that means saintly, perv.  To her 16 salsas, I'm forever faithful. I can't even bring myself to eat a shrimp burrito or dogfish shark taco* from anywhere else.**   I swear, I'm a one-burrito woman. Let La Santisima show you the light.  *No dogs/fish were harmed in the making of this taco.  **dogfish shark tacos aren't available anywhere else around here, anyway.

I immediately surpassed the standard, mildly enthused, "ooh's" and "ahh's" that accompany trying a new restaurant when I arrived at Pomegranate, going straight for elementary school girl-esque high pitched squeals instead. As my eyes flitted between the glass-encased pastries, breakfast menu, mostly raw dessert window, black board, and other people's plates, I got the anxious-excited onset of knowing that I was about to eat a LOT of food.   Here's what I had the pleasure of tasting (and have been craving all day... if only they were open on Mondays *le sigh*):  The breakfast burrito was awesome for a number of reasons. First, the actual wrap looks and tastes homemade... none of that grocery store tortilla debauchery. Second, there are sweet potatoes inside. Orange morsels of joy, if you will. Finally, you get to choose egg or tofu, and vegan or regular cheese. Customizable. Food. Rocks. We also had Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast... sounds amazing already, right? What that name doesn't reveal, however, is that it's made from griddled banana bread. Grilled, crunchy-edged, banana-y, rhubarb jam-smothered, fresh fruit and vegan whipped cream topped heaven. If you're not salivating after reading that, just get out of here.  For dessert, the raw tiramisu took the cake. Or took the tiramisu. Whatever. Either way, I will never miss, desire, or crave "classic" tiramisu again. I've been converted... enlightened, rather. The raw Snickers bar was admirable, but dare I say the cashew caramel layer was too sweet for my tastes? Not that that prevented my finishing it.. it didn't. Overall though, 'twas was a bit much. And, if you're tentative to venture into the raw dessert world (wimp), you can't go wrong with a cowgirl cookie.  ... And if that's too high a word count to process, just take away this message: Go to Pomegranate. Order a variety of things. It's a place of wonders. You shan't regret it.

So... I think Pomegranate and I might have more than a spring fling. I don't want to jinx it, but this could be really serious. I introduced Pomegranate to my mom, my best friends, and even my current boyfriend, but everyone agrees, they can see me spending the rest of my life with Pomegranate. Here's my recount of our classic love story, one dish at a time.  I knew I'd fallen after tasting the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast (griddle-dipped banana bread, drizzled in rhubarb sauce, strawberries, and topped with cream) Then, the Tiramisu (coconut-based espresso, cream, and date-nut crust layers) sent me head over heels. The Breakfast Burrito left me satisfied, but didn't create that same spark that the flavorful Ranchero Skillet once did. Luckily, the hemp milk latte and famous cowgirl cookie quickly helped me remember why I committed to Pomegranate in the first place.  Our relationship moved to a new level - raw - a few months ago. The rainbow wrap was ridiculously huge and filling (much more so than the basic, but tasty, Mediterranean wrap). It was almost more than I could handle. I tossed the bland Indian sweet potato hummus it came with and focused on what really mattered... finishing the wrap. I cared too much not to. After stuffing myself into oblivion, Pomegranate surprised me with a coffee-choco-nana & coconut milk ice cream shake afterward... topped with crushed chocolate-almond pillows. Within seconds of my first spoonful, the fire was back, and burning hotter than ever.  Shortly afterwards, I fell into a confused rut, messing around with vegan meats and cheeses of all varieties. The southwestern mac 'n' cheese, much like the Philly cheese steak, tantalized me with its decadence, but left me feeling sick and low afterwards. Even the delicious, nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl, brimming with sprouts, veggies and quinoa, was only posing as Mr. Right. Tainted by the presence of faux-chicken, I shied away after only two rendezvouses. Not even dessert could lure me back, for both the chocolate cake (dry) and almond butter square (boring) were a disappointment.  It was all my fault. What was I thinking? A few weeks later, I rushed back, determined to mend the gaping hole in my heart. I downed the mushroom bisque and half a pesto presto sandwich (Kamut baguette, fresh avocado, pesto, fresh veggies) in under five minutes. Oh, how I missed the fresh ingredients, the whole foods, the homemade flavor in every bite. Still, I needed some sugar after being away. Lucky for me, the Cannoli (brûlée'd sugar shell, cashew cream filling, dark chocolate chips, and berry sauce), not only provided that, but was better than any Cannoli I'd ever had. And I've had a fair share of Cannolis in my day. What more can a girl ask for?   Pomegranate, I do.

Brown paper packages, filled up with meats, these are a few of my favorite eats...  Goat curry, jerk chicken, rice, beans, plantains... Great value, thick accents, no ambiance. Everything you want in a hole in the wall. Service may not be quick, but good things come to those who wait.  You can't have everything. But you can have your spice and eat it, too. Oh, and they have cheesecake, so you can have your cake and eat that cliché, too.

The most stuffed I've ever been in my entire life hasn't been in any of the great food cities of the world. It's been at Devoured, two years in a row.  After a vivid recollection of last year: cringing from fullness while simultaneously forcing one of Green's roasted marshmallows down my throat, being unable to stop until I'd tasted every last dish, I thought I'd learned my lesson.  This year, I managed not to completely finish any of the dishes (aside from Lon's dark chocolate-dipped salted caramel pop... sweet baby Jesus) and planned to leave feeling uncomfortably full, at most. However, on my way out, I saw that they expanded this year's lineup, setting up a handful of restaurant booths and an entire strip of dessert places inside the cafe and Great Hall. Rat bastards. I literally haven't eaten for 27 hours and am still full.  My advice for next year: save anything that comes in a bag for later, and arrive STARVING. I cannot get enough of everything about Devoured. The food is stellar, the lines are non-existent (thanks to the flocks of people that essentially just go to drink and socialize), and the selection is immense enough to cause death by gluttony if you're the kind of person who has to taste everything.   P.S .- I didn't even eat any meat and I pretty much rolled out of the festival.

When I ask, "What kind of milks do you have?" and the barista responds, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN." I immediately think a) they only have one kind of milk and b) the barista hates me/milk/life.  However, when I replied, "Like non-dairy milk options..." and she went, "Yeah! We have 1%, whole, skim, rice, almond, soy..." I was temporarily perplexed, but mostly just relieved. Not only was she totally friendly, but proceeded to chat up my friend and I, sharing funny anecdotes and sarcastically grand thoughts on the restaurant business. I would even go so far as to say she was downright awesome in those five minutes.  I ordered an iced almond milk latte, which was also downright awesome, and the espresso was sweet and nutty (maybe a little bit like the barista)? Either way, I'll be back for more of both. And next time, I'll just ask for the almond milk.

Maybe I'll delete this when Echo uses their website to accurately depict when lunch is served.  I walk in at 2:06 under the wild impression that lunch is served until 3 ("First, the lunch menu is offered from 11am to 3pm" - echo website) and am informed the kitchen closes at 2. I promptly feel like an ass hat for bothering to do my homework, but am too hungry to question it. Rather than seeing if they can find the virtue in their hearts to push the newly established limit by six minutes, I high tail it out as fast as my car can get me to D'lish.   Disappointment can often be remedied by a good tuna sandwich, but I wanted that disappointment to be nonexistent and that good tuna sandwich to be from Echo. Life is hard sometimes... this does not need to be one of those times.   Update the interweb page, y'all.

Swallowed my pride, as well as lunch at Echo... Man, was that tuna sandwich worth the wait. That's not a sentence I say more than like, once a decade.  Apricots, apple cider dressing, avocado... What would I do for a Klondike bar? Far fewer things than I would for this sandwich. Well done, Echo, I tip my hat to thee.

The Duce - a boxing ring, etc.!  Knock-out: - s'mores cheesecake "for four" "people" blowtorched to order. - bacon mac 'n' cheese muffins because don't be a sociopath just get them. - the chicken pot pie that will accompany Marie Callender's resignation letter. - ping pong, hula hooping, karaoke, vintage kitchen, bleachers, memorabilia, nostalgia.    Other boxing term for decent: - banana cream pie milkshake brings a few boys to the yard. - noodle kugel, served cold and fruity for instant "Shabbat moment" flavor. - breakfast and meatball slider rated edible by 9/10 gastroenterologists. - tons of seating only it's hot AF and everyone wants to be at the 4 cool tables.  Third boxing term for not preferable: - chicken sausage reminiscent of wet cat food in a tube. - corn hole.  I don't know sh*t about boxing. Not all the food is awesome, but pretty much everything else is, and the festivities are free. Also, all the food was made in a trailer so stop whining. Now get up in the ring and lemme hear ya sing "ROXXXXAAAAANE."

Treehouse is half an hour from my house. I can get vegan pie, cupcakes, cookies, and pretty much everything else Treehouse offers, from places considerably less than half an hour from my house. The thing is, I no longer want vegan pie, cupcakes, cookies, or pretty much anything else from anywhere except Treehouse.  After walking in to find candy-striped pink walls, shiny white tables decorated with pink flowers in glass vases, and white counter tops with glass casing home to all sorts of baked goods, my hopes were high. Who doesn't love Earth Balance and good design coexisting harmoniously?   First we tried a day-old s'mores cupcake, which is half the price of a regular cake and 90% as good. The cake was rich and chocolatey, just like the frosting. There wasn't much of a graham crust on the bottom, though, so it was more like a double chocolate cupcake. Not that I'm complaining. The only thing that didn't taste fresh was the marshmallow on top, but it was still a total steal for $1.25.   But, what's better than a good deal? Answer: when a store owner says, "Would you guys mind being guinea pigs?" and motions to a fresh batch of thumbprint cookies. Wait.... FREE COOKIES? No, we don't mind at all, kind lady. We each tried a buttery, chewy cookie with a berry in the center who's name escapes me, but is apparently related to the ground cherry. 'Twas mighty tasty.  We took a Chai cupcake to-go, which was spicy, moist, and topped with the best frosting ever. It's probably best that I don't know what it's made from, and just assume it's unicorn tears. We also had the chocolate chip cookie, which was perfectly crammed with chocolate chips, chewy, hollow, and slightly cinnamon-y. I don't think it needed the cinnamon, but maybe that's because I just had a Chai cupcake.   Next on my to-eat list is a fresh-baked pie, during pie happy hour on Wednesdays, of course. Overall, my thoughts on Treehouse Bakery can be summed up concisely: YES.

How good is Torched Goodness?  Well, it's a mobile Creme Brûlée operation that began during the worst depression in the United States since the Great Depression and has managed to stay in business. That should be your first clue that something's being done right.  Next, they offer a Salted Caramel Creme Brûlée, as in, crunchy and creamy, juxtaposed, made out of nothing but sugar, salt, and fat. What more could you crave? Nothing, unless you're some kind of sea floor bacterium.  Does it make sense as a concept? Not really. Should that stop you from buying a gourmet dessert from a truck window? Not unless you hate happiness.

Heads up: If you're a vegetarian, don't expect some epic veggie dog. They focus more on the quality of the real meats. It's not bad, it's just kind of measly and you could probably microwave it at home from a package.  That being said, don't be discouraged, dear herbivores. There's so much delicious shiznit that goes on top, you won't even be thinking about the dog itself. From fried pickles, to sauteed onions, to mango chutney, to bleu cheese, it's basically a topping smorgasbord. How does all of that fit in a hot dog bun? It doesn't. It's wrapped in an awesome, big-ass piece of naan, and it's going to cost you a whole 5 bucks. Even if you're not a hot dog fiend, Short Leash is a good time, so go for the novelty of it (because next time I personally deep-fry pickles for a hot dog will be approximately never.)

Want to know how to make an awesome doughnut taste less awesome? Have someone annoy the hell out of you first.  All I wanted was a doughnut with custard inside.  Big. Damn. Deal.  After expressing this desire to the server, she told me they didn't have any. I asked if there was anything close to a custard doughnut. Then, she changed her mind and told me they did actually have one, with chocolate on top. I noticed a sign that said "custard claw" on it, and inquired about the doughnut behind it. After failing to understand me for the better part of a minute, she said "Oh yeah," and put it into a bag. Lady, you have one job. Come on.  I drive off and take a bite of the doughnut. NO CUSTARD. ABORT MISSION. I make a sharp U-turn into the drive through, hand the lady my partially-eaten doughnut, and say, "Give me custard or give me death." She asks if I want cream or Jell-O filling. "I guess Jell-O filling?" I say, feeling a tad uneasy that they fill their doughnuts with instant Jell-O pudding.  She tells me there's only the chocolate and custard kind, but then I notice a little picture of coconut custard doughnut on the drive-through window. When I ask about that, she says, "Oh, that's like the chocolate one, only it's coconut instead." "So... it's a different doughnut with custard in it." I say. "Yes," she replies. "I'll take it." YOU HAD ONE JOB. It was as if she had a personal vendetta against me that manifested in the form of preventing me from having custard.  The doughnut was flaky, light, delicious and brimming with custard. Guess what? All I can taste is the flavor of irritated. Next time, I'll just treat myself to a pack of Jell-O pudding.

Vegheads and carnivores alike, rejoice! Even though just about every item on the menu comes with some variety of meat, they can all be substituted with grilled tofu. Even though there's only one standard vegetarian wrap available (the Veggie Jackson).... it' delicious. Plus, the combination of feta, garlic rice, and heaps of spicy veggies wrapped in a spinach tortilla make for a really filling meatless meal.   And, if wraps aren't for you, fear not! The bowls are awesome, especially the teriyaki and bangkok (and the carrot cake looked pretty damn good, too... eh, to hell with lunch food).

OH DWAM YOU'VE JUST DISCOVERED THE BEST CUPCAKERY AROUND.   Congratulations! Here's how to proceed (choose any/all of the following):  1) Order a deep dark chocolate cupcake with mint buttercream frosting topped with an andes mint. Smell it. Cherish it. Cry over it when it's gone.  2) Order something with fudge frosting on it. Become addicted. Deny eating it, then order another.  3) Order a banana Nutella cupcake, i.e. the most tender banana cake known to man, topped with Nutella cream cheese frosting. Savor it, then buy four for tomorrow.  3) Order a breakfast cupcake to go. In the morning, enjoy the moist, delicate coffee (cup)cake topped with cinnamon sugar crumble. Disregard anything bad that happens for the rest of the day. Love life.  5) Put on your fanciest hat and order an almond tea cake topped with light whipped orange cream cheese frosting.

With all the new shiz available at 21, I'm forced to re-edit my previous statement. Here's how to do it:  1. Order a pretzel dipped in milk chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Eat it while someone rings you up, then buy the entire glass jar of them right before they get the chance to charge you for the first one.  2. Buy a macaron in every flavor. Order coffees for two, then drink both coffees and feed yourself the macarons. There's no time for shame, we're talking about Parisian confections here.  3. Find yourself torn between craving a cookie and a cupcake. Come to 21 Cakes and order the Snickerdoodle cupcake. Melt into a pile of joy.  4. Order a small box of Vanilla Salted Caramel cupcakes as a nice gift for some friends. Walk to your car. Notice you've accidentally eaten the entire box. Repeat.  5. Set free the classy inner child within yourself. Enjoy a cold glass of milk and a peanut butter chocolate cupcake. No one cares if you get frosting on your face. Look at you, you adorable little inner child.  6. Start your diet with a lemon cupcake and a banana nutella cupcake for two servings of fruit. That's how it works, right?  7. Celebrate your birthday by picking your favorite 21 Cakes cupcake and having the staff turn it into a beautiful layer cake. Blow out your candles, surrounded by friends and family, then treat it like a cupcake by proceeding to consume the entire thing yourself, without a fork.  Ready? Set, go!

Seasons 52 has a secret vegan menu! It's not particularly extensive, but at least they're aware that vegans are, in fact, not just the stuff of legend. They offer choices like ponzu-glazed tofu, cranberry almond tabouli, and farmer's market-esque vegetable penne. Go you, Seasons 52, go you.   On an unrelated-but-equally-positive note, Michael was the best waiter known to man (honestly, i usually don't even notice restaurant staff), and I'd like to thank him for helping my boyfriend ask me to prom via a shot glass of rocky road cake. High fives all around.

Let's just say, if Jamburritos had a creepy song that played loudly from their truck and cruised around residential areas on the regular, I'd be running barefoot down the street with my mom's change purse in hand.   Honestly, who would even mourn the demise of the ice cream truck with the evolution of the Creolexican truck?   P.S. If you had the nerve to say, "me"... Well, I couldn't even hear you over the pleasant crunching of my Jamburritos hushpuppies anyway.

This is literally the fastest way to become the subject of a rap about having a nice body. All of these songs (and more) were inspired by women who do pilates at The Body Lab.   "Got the body of a goddess" (I'm in Love With a Stripper) "Damn youz a sexy bitch!" (That one song) "Look it how she walk... you know she know she bad" (Bedrock) "Honey got a booty like wow-oh-wow" (OMG)  An ethereal presence. Sex Appeal. Confidence. A nice butt. What are you waiting for? Get on it.

Well, they done done it. Press is officially on the almond milk bandwagon.  They make one helluva thick, rich, low-calorie, nutritious almond milk latte, and I know Snapple has underserving dibs on the slogan, but I dare say one of these bad boys is made from the best stuff on Earth.

The steak salad - mouth & mind-blowing... seriously, go get it now. Chopped salad? Always a favorite, but also available at Cowboy Ciao. The fried chicken (incredible) and waffle (inedible) left us wanting more fried meat, but the truly stellar service made us forget about food we didn't care to eat.  A warning: the dessert is NOT worth 10 dollars,  Not nearly as interesting as the description implies, They were standard, too small, and left much to be desired...  the apple pie, cheesecake, and bread pudding just tasted like lies.  The ambiance, romantic, and service, quite grand. The main courses were great (though the waffle was bland). You're likely to leave CPH full of quality cuisine and glee, and if it's yo birthday, they'll give you fudge balls, fo' free.

Mmmm tempura shrimp and peanut sauce? Soft shell crab and miso ginger sauce? Maybe it's just because I love crunchy, fried bottom-feeders and awesome sauces.... but Rice Paper provides them both at a price I can afford, and so to you all on 7th I say, HELL YEAH.

The dishes at Rice Paper (overall) are fresh, tasty, and healthy. The sauces are exceptional. It's hard to choose between the ginger miso and peanut hoisin, but either one is good enough to eat with a spoon... however, lick-worthy dips can't quite bring a place back from the depths of intolerable service.  Holy hell, the service... not just bad, but weird. Really weird. In three visits, not one has been free of something bizarre and unacceptable.  The first time I came to Rice Paper was when it first opened. The food was good! The atmosphere was pleasant! The guy talking to us the entire time was not! I don't know if he worked there or partially owns the place, but he had some kind of authority and some nerve not to let us chew in peace. Maybe I'm just mildly antisocial towards strangers while in the middle of eating a soft shell crab salad and can't appreciate those kinds of interactions, but regardless, it didn't deter me from trying again.  The second time I went, a gluten-free friend was amongst my companions. The waiter claimed a bunch of things were gluten-free, then kept going back to the kitchen to check, and it repeatedly turned out that they weren't. When the waiter finally figured out something gluten-free for our friend to order, everything was fine. Until he became violently ill later that day. Lesson: if it's not gluten-free, it's better not to lie.  The most recent time I visited Rice Paper was on a date. We sat in the only free spot, next to a boisterously loud couple who appeared to be talking with an owner. After a cilia-damaging cackle emerged from the table, I turned around with a rather blank, dismayed expression. Then I turned back to my date and said, "Should we find another table?" The owner approached us, grabbing my shoulder, and said "Do you have something to complain about, too?" I was shocked and can't remember the rest of the conversation, other than that she grabbed my shoulder and squeezed it twice more. She better have been drunk... I mean, WHAT THE ACTUAL F$%&. I almost left right then, and if it weren't for the peanut hoisin sauce, I probably would have.

I just have to say, Carmel's has the most appealing, least obtrusively horrible art of pretty much any coffee shop in the valley. Go, you guys! (Thoughts of Portlandia, anyone?)  Digressions aside, we ventured over to Carmel's to give their coffee and brunchisms a shot over the weekend, and were all pleased. The breakfast crepe with tomatoes, eggs, goat cheese, and spinach was definitely the stand-out, but the breakfast croissant and egg white omelet got ravaged, as well.  However, when we ordered half-caff almond milk lattes, the girl at the counter went, "umm... okaay...." (motions to barista) "do you know what 'haaalf-calllf' is???" To which he replied, "Yes." They turned out to be the best in the area I'd say, *turns nose up at LGO* so that all worked out, but we laughed about it for the next 20 minutes. Half-calf? Like part baby cow milk, part grown-up cow milk? He-he-ha-ha-ho. No. But again, I digress.

What started as "dinner" quickly became an evening of my wildest pig fantasies.  We started at the top: pig ears, sliced thin and served in a heap of fresh herbs. Pungent, savory, addictive.  We moved down to the neck, stewed and plated solo, white rice on the side. Fragrant, tender, and too good not to use your hands a little (a lot.) Once you go neck, you never go back.   Even further down... Pork ribs in a clay pot. Served alongside salty, saucy eggplant and potatoes, piping hot. Damned if we waited for it to cool to a reasonable temperature.   Lastly, mouth-first into unknown pig part territory.  Pork and Napa cabbage, entwined beneath the doughy folds of soup dumplings.  If you are what you eat... Let's just say I'm f*cking awesome.

Churn offers tasteful, albeit, normcore ice creams served by two of the friendliest, most engaging ice cream scooper deities I have ever encountered. In a nutshell, two enthusiastic dudes greeted my mom and I with, "we love giving out samples!" and it took me fourteen seconds to decide that I want these to be the only two people I have to interact with on any given day.  So while I'm sampling everything and carefully trying not to mouth the words "I love you," fantastic ice cream scooper #2 tells me that Vietnamese coffee is the obvious pairing choice for mint cookie. To my dismay, I inform him that caffeine at this moderately late hour is dangerous. He tells me it's decaffeinated. I make a small animal noise.  The perfectly paired mint cookie and Vietnamese coffee in a (slightly stale) waffle cone with a side of homemade, excellent, unusually light hot fudge was real good. However, by factoring in impossibly charismatic service, the experience goes from real good to dopesauce, making Churn one of my favorite ice cream spots in Phoenix.

A strip mall in Ahwatukee is home to the Arizonian best cheese shop I've ever been to.  - Rennet types are listed & very much appreciated. - Sammiches are all varieties of cheesy and bready, but consistently quality.  - The selection of cheese truffles will make you forget you're in a strip mall in Ahwatukee.   It's pricey, but it's worth it. Sit outside, get some cheesy morsels, and revel in it.   Can't get enough? Also bring a metric sh*t ton of goodies home with you, then say to your significant other, "We don't need no money, baby, we got everything we need right here." *smile and point to massive assortment of cheeses that just cost you the remnants of your joint bank account*

Hot diggity damn, there's a new BBQ place in town (and by "town" I am referring directly to the imaginary place my dreams occur in.)   The pulled pork and coleslaw are not to be missed (shredded things drenched in tasty sauce = all systems go), and save room for the old-fashioned banana pudding. Not many folks in the Southwest can make a banana pudding like these fellas... and even fewer can make my mother literally pull the dessert we're sharing away from me and finish it before I've had my second bite.   Between BBQ sauce that I'd lick off the bottom of an old cowboy boot and brisket that makes me feel disloyal to my own grandmother's secret recipe, these are the areas where Texas BBQ truly shines. There's no question that this comfy hole-in-the-wall knows how to put a sauce-stained smile on my face.

Zoe's is special for not fearing the Americanized taste bud. I don't mean the food is super exotic... I mean that they don't serve deceitful food just because it's popular.  Many a "healthy" restaurant is so scared of people complaining about taste that they hide absurd quantities of sugar, fat, and salt in their dishes, just to avoid losing clients that probably shouldn't be there anyway. The rest of us end up with an entree that appears greener and more nutritious, but is actually just brimming with the same problem ingredients as the pasta everyone secretly wanted.  Not at Zoe's. Sure, not every dish is "healthy", but the menu is pleasantly accommodating to any diet. They replaced every one of the original sides that came with my kebabs in exchange for a heap of veggies without hesitation. You can pretty much build your own dish, and for people avoiding gluten, dairy, obesity, this, that, and the other... that's pretty cool.   The meat is cooked simply, nothing is drowned in sauce, and they don't skimp on the greenery. Plus, calories and nutrition facts are all available if you're feeling neurotic. Kudos to Zoe's, because even if my veggies would have tasted better soaked in cheese, my stomach thanks you.

Thrive! has been on my to-do list for many moons... after all, it's the only place to get an acai bowl within an hour of Scottsdale. I finally made it down to Gilbert this morning, and now I hate myself for not discovering the glory of Thrive sooner (but really, I love myself, because I just had a giant acai bowl and am feelin' fine).  My favorite thing about Thrive is the ingredient selection, which tops anywhere I've been in California. They even beat out Sambazon's Acai Cafe, which is 100% build-your-own bowl style. Yes, there's a menu, but many a secret ingredient hides in the kitchen, including super foods like cacao nibs, goji berries, spirulina, maca powder, hemp and chia seeds. Other highlights include homemade nut butters, protein powders, all kinds of berries and tropical fruit, and hemp-flax or gluten-free granola.  I'm too excited by any restaurant's build-your-own option to order a set menu item, and given the myriad possibilities laid out before me... I knew the original bowl wasn't going to cut it. I made my own acai blend (spirulina, cacao nibs, chocolate protein powder, banana, and walnut butter) and topped it off hemp-flax granola, walnuts, and chocolate shavings. AY. DIOS. MIO. Too delicious for English words... and five hours later, I'm still full.  The owner was even sweet enough to let us try free samples of the tropical, chocolate peanut butter, and chocolate coconut bowls... which were unsurprisingly scrumptious. Overall, I'm left with these two thoughts: 1) Even if Thrive is 25 minutes away, I've got plans to fill out my punch card and get a 10th bowl free before the end of the month, and 2) Why is there only one of these? Time to start replacing Scottsdale's 473 crap-tastic FroYo places with acai cafes!

Spicy, sweet, tangy, savory, crunchy, chewy oh my god doesn't exist but try this pizza and you shall believe. Pizza Re, you make one of the best things I have ever eaten (if we can legally call the incident, "eating.")  Seriously, this is all on one pizza: fig & jalapeno jam, toasted pine nuts, caramelized onions, spinach, balsamic.   Next time (and then will be a next time, damn it) I'd ask for the crust a little crispier and the cheese a little lighter. Since this ain't no pepperoni pizza, the chewy dough and oily cheese added a bit of unnecessary heaviness, but they just NAIL'D IT in the flavor department. Best combination of toppings ever.  There isn't much of an ambiance, and the staff a was a little misfit for the concept. Young, rowdy dudes who really look like they want to be outside skateboarding make for interactions like this: "Excuse me, is the tiramisu made in-house?" "Yeah we got it." But that's not really the important part, because you should probably get your pizza to go if you're going to consume it the way I did.  Veni, Vidi, I blacked out and destroyed an entire pizza by myself.

AY. DIOS. MIO.  The Platano Paleta is a day-maker. There's caramel, creamy, frozen chunks of banana, and añejo rum all swirled together on one wooden stick. At least five different people asked me what I was eating and where they could get it as I walked down Mill Avenue, vainly trying not to make eye contact with anyone while eating a popsicle. If you're looking for something new and interesting (and sexy, as popsicles go), eating one of these would be more effective in drowning one's sorrows than a pint of ice cream.  For the more timid, or perhaps just fans of classic flavors, the Fresa con Crema actually smells and tastes of a fresh, organic strawberry upon first bite, until the flavor of rich cream overwhelms the taste buds to create a perfect harmony of awesome and more awesome. Anyone who's partial to artificial strawberry flavor over that of a real strawberry should a) avoid this paleta and b) reprogram your mouth and possibly reevaluate your life.   Pure fruit lovers, even you cannot escape the appeal of Paletas Betty. The Pura Piña is almost just a frozen pineapple on a stick, but much more exciting. It's a sweet, delectable confection filled with pineapple pieces and a consistency that's closer to creamy than it is to icy, even though this one's totally vegan. It also contains some sort of hallucinogen that will make you think you're in Jamaica for a short period of time.  Go. Eat. Prosper. You'll probably see me there with a paleta in each hand.

A 100% vegan bakery in Central Phoenix? Dear God. All at once, I'm infuriated and relieved that it's so far away from my house.  Here's what we ordered: 1. Banana bread-  It has a brown sugar crust. It's delicate, and flavorful, and it has a brown sugar crust. Brown. Sugar. Crust. Order it. 2. Winkie (Twinkie)- If you want to go vegan but can't bear to give up Hostess crap, now you don't have to! It's just like a Twinkie, only it doesn't contain beef fat and won't give you cancer. 3. Nami Cake (Ding Dong) This is a rich, dark chocolate cupcake topped with chocolate ganache and filled with cream. Essentially, it's a Ding Dong, if the gas station suddenly became a patisserie.  4. Chocolate chip cookie - If you lean towards chewier cookies that are definitely on the sweet side, this is the cookie for you. Plus, they're huge and full of big chocolate chips, and everyone leans towards that.   5. Mini cupcake - The one we sampled was a vanilla almond, which I should like... but the sweetness totally outweighed the flavor. However, I think that ratio goes over well with most people, so hey. 6. Cake pops - The chocolate cake pop covered in dark chocolate hit the spot. This was the most intense chocolate-y thing we ordered, which by the transitive property might make it the best thing? If you're a fan of chocolate, you're a fan of these. Millions of these.  Next time: I still need to try something from the coffee bar, which will undoubtedly be accompanied by banana bread... and probably a cake pop (I mean, I drove all the way out there...)  Apparently, they also do a Tsoynami called "The Mash", which is filled with random mashed up baked goods (I was only informed of this afterward.) Now that I've tasted the desserts the old-fashioned way, separately, why not get them combined and smothered in ice cream? It only seems natural (and I mean, come on, I drove all the way out there...)

I don't even know how many times I've been to Nami since it opened. It really doesn't matter that it's 30 minutes away from my house... I make up reasons to go weekly.  An update on the "Here's what we ordered" section: 1. Cinnamon roll - A classic. They heat it up for you so that it's too warm and fragrant and irresistible not to finish. It's perfect. I hate it. I hate them. (That's a lie.) 2. Chocolate cake doughnut -  Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a ring-shaped piece of chocolate cake. That said, it's a very good piece of ring-shaped chocolate cake. 3. Sugar cookie -  I brought this home for my very non-vegan little sister, who tasted it immediately and said, "This (nom) is the best (nom) sugar cookie (nom) I've ever had in my life!" 4. House made granola, yogurt & berry parfait -  Nami's granola is like cocaine. You will never be able to have enough of it. But that's okay, because on some mornings it just feels right. I do wish the yogurt wasn't soy-based and the berries weren't frozen, but honestly, it still rocks. 5. Vegan Victory Bar -  If you're looking for something more wholesome, this peanut butter-chocolate-spirulina (hence the green color)-nut-seed bar will satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel gypped for picking the 'healthier' option. 6. Hazelnut milk latte -  Any of the lattes from Nami are fantastic. Choose coconut, almond, soy, hazelnut, or rice milk for a strong, nutty cup of awesome (and you can sweeten it with Stevia!) 7. The MASH - If you're feeling daring, this is a fun way to spin the wheel of dessert fortune. I've ended up with a carrot cake tsoynami and a mint chocolate chip one. Both were delicious, but nothing beats the Monsoon. 8. Brownie - Literally the best brownie I've ever had. So chewy-rich-intensely-chocolate-y. It didn't even taste like there was flour in it. I want a hundred of them. Right now. 9. Peanut butter bar - Don't be intimidated by this dense looking log. It's actually a light, crunchy, nougat-y bar with a thin layer of chocolate on top, although it does resemble peanut butter fudge.  The thing is... I've never had brunch here, which means I should probably head back on Sunday to get a feel for it. Now there's an idea.

Another Green? You mean, we don't all have to eat at Green in Tempe everyday? Vegans, scatter!   To be fair, this location doesn't have the super-customized hipster vibes of the original Green, as in, there aren't painted car doors lining the walls, but it offers the same great food in a metropolitan area. Plus, Nami is right next door, which is essentially a fat, animal-loving kid's heaven.  Currently, my nom of choice is the orecchiette with mock meatballs. If you're missing meat, or need to convince some judgmental bacon-lover that vegan food isn't a leaf on a piece of tofu, order this. Delicious, savory meatballs, smothered in cheese and marinara over veggies and pasta? Hardly part of an ascetic lifestyle. Oh, and it's eight bucks. Double awesome.  Nutshell Review: Tastebuds: delighted. Tummy: full. Wallet: fat. Conscience: clear.

I ran off into the night, hair flying, hands clutching both sides of the paper plate. I'd ordered from Pizza People before; my date had not. Ideally, I'd never let him.   The perfectly crisp gluten-free crust, vegan cheese that tasted like rich white cheddar & mozzarella (rather than vomit), and the delicious smattering of mushrooms and basil adorning that personal pizza had won my heart long before he could, and that is how it was destined to stay. After giving up dairy and gluten, all that was left of a pizza was the tomato sauce. Somehow, I was enjoying a pizza, sans tomato sauce, dietary restrictions in tact!  Crouched behind a graffiti'd wall, I ravaged that pizza with a passion reserved only for the glory that emerges from the Pizza People truck.

For all of you weight-loss oriented new year's resolution folks who can't bear to stop eating out and about, here's the solution.  This place is GENUINELY healthy (I'm still glaring at you, True Food), damn good, and totally affordable (Thanks, LocalDines!).  Some breakfast standouts include the gluten-free Belgian waffles. They're smothered in almond butter, coconut cream, and bananas. Give me that over whipped cream and chocolate chips any day, fatties. That was rude. I take that last part back. Moving on... The frittata was also delicious. Eggs, vegetables, cheese (or rice cheese), and a whole-grain english muffin with jam. Perfect morning fuel, and one of the only guiltless breakfasts I've enjoyed out on the town (eff you, Matt's Big Breakfast, with your glutinous temptations oozing with fat. Okay, I still love you.)  For lunch, the gluten-free pasta, veggie burger, and burrito have all been awesome. Yes, gluten and dairy-free individuals can still enjoy a fat, cheesy burrito. Deprivation is for wusses.. you can look good and enjoy food here. If you don't like soft veggie burgers, don't order this one. I loved it, though. Veganaise is my friend.  The Parfait is probably the healthiest, most decadent I've ever had at a restaurant. Layers of bananas, chocolate pudding, almond butter and strawberries. Majorly satisfying (mildly orgasmic). I'd eat it for dinner and be full until the next day. In fact, I may go do that right now.

I would like to sublet a plot of land on Tom's Thumb.   The availability of things inside this CAR WASH is so expansive, yet specific, that I'm almost certain I just made it up.   Exceptional pulled pork, sleek leather purses that convert into backpacks, southern biscuits and grits, southwestern themed wine corkscrews, Quest bars, half a dozen kinds of BBQ sauce, old fashioned doughnuts... Everything one would see in a bizarre dream? Nope, just everything I bought.   If that's not everything on your list, there's also an impressive cat paraphernalia department, as well as imported soaps, and summer campy throwback ice cream novelties.   If you're just looking to go out to eat... at a car wash... that's also a nice restaurant with a patio.... and a coffee bar... and a bakery, then boy, is this the spot for you!  At lunch, go for the pulled pork sandwich. The classic hickory BBQ sauce leaves nothing to be desired. Put the mayo-less cole slaw on top. Skip the brisket, which is drier and tougher, and don't order a side of fruit unless you want just pineapple and apple.   Breakfast is down home phenomenal - the pig 'n' grits offers you not one, but two kinds of frighteningly delicious pig items - bacon and crispy pulled pork atop creamy grits. Covered in cheddar cheese. Add an egg. You are welcome. The biscuits are scone-y and delightful, and the coffee is great (but for all y'all frappé wimps, rather intense.)   Tl;dr - Tom's Thumb is le shiznit. Get anything pulled pork. Bummer that it's so conceptually redonkulous it probably doesn't exist, save for in my head... great idea, though, right?

If Giant Coffee and Lux had a baby, it would be Songbird. The shop is similar to Giant's small, simple space, but encompasses the hipster flare of Lux with its vintage knick knacks and comfy, loungey furniture.  However, Songbird has a rebellious streak. If you want goat milk in your coffee, they've got it. They sell a variety of burritos right alongside their bakery selection. Their menu is written with Scrabble tiles. They don't make their own granola, they make Bertha's Cafe make it. Their almond milk latte is twice as intense as anywhere else's. It's not nutty. It's espresso-y. Bitter. Punch you in the face good, definitey not "shall we have a biscuit with this?" kind of good.   If you find yourself yearning for the teenaged love child of coffee shops you've already found and conquered, give Songbird a try. It's pretty bad ass. I mean, goat milk. Come on.

For someone on a perpetual quest for açaí bowls, 'tis a bold claim to make... but, Mojo's PB Monkey has set the new standard.  So why's this açaí newcomer food truck kicking so many asses and taking so many names? Let's pick apart the product:  The blend: organic açaí, wild blueberries, banana, peanut butter, and chocolate almond milk. I gotta give props for the organic açaí, and the finished product tastes like it contains powdered açaí, not sorbet. This might be less fun for people who want to pretend they're eating ice cream, but my recommendation is to go get ice cream if that's you. The peanut butter is natural (and delicious) and almond milk is exponentially better than soy milk or apple juice in every regard. Plus, even if there's some added sugar, it's chocolate-y, and I dig that.  The toppings: Laura's Gourmet Granola, banana, walnuts, dried cranberries, carob chips, and honey. Mojo uses granola made in Tempe, and even though it contains brown sugar and canola oil (tsk tsk) there's only a sprinkling of it on top. Places that overload their bowls with fatty, sugary granola turn the whole thing into a hippie-dippy sundae of regret. The walnuts, carob and fresh banana on top were a perfect combination, and I skipped the honey and dried cranberries because it was sweet enough without them.   The PB Monkey combines all the best things about açaí bowl into one: it's healthy, filling, nutritious, uses local/wild/other expensive-sounding words/natural/organic ingredients, and leaves you feeling awesome. $8.50 for a bowl of happiness that keeps me satisfied through lunch time? Açaí, I say yeeee.  P.S. - Good people of Mojo, might I suggest using a larger bowl? Trying to mix the piled-up toppings into the blend is damn near impossible without spilling a few good morsels and then lying on the ground, sobbing, while watching them melt in the sun.

Since I'm on a never-ending quest for the best pizza with figs on it in the world (life's too short for quests of any actual importance), I had to check out the Biaggia, made with goat cheese, fig, arugula and proscuitto. It put forth a decent effort, but needed more fig and goat cheese. However, the crust was dreamy and the service was friendly, which sort of compensated for a few extra dollops of flavor-balancing pizza toppings. Il Bosco also offers small, tasty desserts, topped with Sweet Republic ice cream. Double local business points for ordering one of those after (get the brownie, warm.)  The bill came out 50 bucks for two pizzas and three desserts, which I'd consider a good deal for ze quality. The crust is truly awesome, the patio's relaxing and pretty, and the free olives are always appreciated. You can pretty much taste the integrity in the pizza at this little local spot, and you probably should if you find yourself in the area.

"H-hey, man. Cou'I cop a bite of that? Nah, nah I ain't fiendin'! I mean, y-you know I got you next time..."  You tell yourself, "I could stop any time I wanted to." But you don't. You don't want to stop.  And this is how it starts.  You KNOW most people get just a cheeseburger OR a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but you had to go and mix them, and now you can't go back. The interaction of ChB and B2Q coursing through your veins gives you the kind of rush that keeps you up at night. Your friends don't understand, but how could they?  "Just one more porkster burger... people do it all the time, right?" Once you've inevitably built up a tolerance to the BBQ pork-topped cheeseburger, and you're jonesin' for more, Rehab is there. You can start doing 10 oz. of patty a day instead of 5 oz. like it's nothin'.  As you spiral further and further out of control, speedballs of sweet potato tots mixed with BBQ pork, pineapple aoli, pretzel rolls, and brioche buns... the kinda shit you'd only heard about... it's all a part of your daily routine.  One day you're a successful young hopeful, the next you're pulling tricks for porksters.  Warning: Rehab once, Relapse forever.

I am so in awe of how in awe I am at Blue Hound that I just want you to go. Part of the appeal is all the sensory surprises, but in case you need some motivation:  THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF WHY I F*CKING LOVE BLUE HOUND:  - Most egg whites (plus one whole egg, for good measure) on a cocktail menu.  - The boozy, housemade horchata situation.  - The drink thing with the whole egg in it also contains crème de mure, stout, and whiskey.  - There is a literal smokeshow that accompanies the Lawless (a tobacco-smoked glass of bourbon, wormwood liqueur, and house-made "truck stop bitters.")  -  Vodka's day at the spa in my mouth: grapefruit liqueur, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, rose flower water.  - The cheese plate. Fig spread. Good bread. Pungent chevre.   In essence, if you pray at the temple of the cocktail God, welcome to salvation. Experimental, complex, artisanal, thoughtful, refined, and fun as hell... heaven. *abandons religious metaphor* Love craft cocktails? Put your physical form at this bar.

"Crêpe Bar. Go time."  "I looked at the menu again last night." "I've looked at it 36 times this week. Their FB menu link went live." And so we were off - mom, lil sister and I - hungry, hyped, and ready for all kinds of tomcrêpery (it's a word now).   The play-by-play:  Breakfast burrito (sans bacon) - egg, cheese, chipotle crepe, avocado salsa. "The best part is the crepe. I just crunched a huge piece of fleur de sel." "What? I can't hear you over the salsa-egg symphony in my mouth." "Why not everything just be crêpes?"  3 mini crêpes - spicy buffalo chicken, carrot slaw, blue cheese.  "Would have been better as a taco. The slaw needs taco." "The flavor is good, but it's all kinda mushy. It does need the crunch." "Wait... it's not one of each kind of those crêpes?"  Griddled chicken crêpe (sans everything) - chicken, cheese, crepe. "Dude, you ordered a quesadilla." "A fancy quesadilla." "Sorry for eating all the edges... the crispy cheese and fluffy crêpe were meant to be together. In my stomach."  Vanilla custard crêpe - dressed strawberries, caramel, crêpe rolls. "There are three crêpe rolls! Perfect!" "Omg taste the brulee'd top part." "Why not everything just be vanilla bean custard? Mor custerd!"  Yogurt parfait - lemon gel, berries, spelt & pistachio granola. "This granola is salty... it's so good." "Oh, there's fruit and stuff on the bottom. Dig!" "What is this stuff? Not quite yogurt... not quite whipped cream. Lemon fluff. Mmm."  Almond milk latte + Chai tea - "What do you mean there's no decaf coffee?" "The coffee's sweet. Not intense. Not quite Village Roastery, but still good." "I am still in awe of this Chai. It's perfection."  Complementary cookies in coffee milk - "This is like Cookie Crisp for grown-ups." "I'm putting a cookie piece in the vanilla custard crêpe. Brilliant." "They should make that a thing! Cookies and cream crêpe."  TL;DR- The service is friendly and cheery, the lemon parfait was really something special, and the vanilla custard crêpe and breakfast burrito are also worth a re-eat sometime. I'm not usually a huge crêpe fan, but consider me a fan of the Crêpe Bar.

Setting: day time, Mill Avenue. We're hungry. The situation is all too familiar. Where should we eat? I don't know, do we want sh*tty pizza or a sh*tty burger or some sh*tty Mexican food?  Enter: Desert Roots Kitchen, the tiny, unassuming kitchen of fresh awesome... now, I never have to have this conversation again.  With offerings like huge wraps, awesome dolmas, cous cous salads, noodle dishes, greens, fresh fruit, granola and yogurt parfaits, and baked goods like brownies, cookies and bars, it's reassuring to know that most everything is vegan (even the white chocolate chips in the cookies and the soy yogurt they have available for parfaits) but not particularly surprising. It's all very simple, natural food. No Tofurky isht. Not up in here.  The staff is friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, and most importantly, willing to let you sample things. I ended up with the vegan parfait for a anti-whopping fee of 3.50... the same price as Nami's! Except, Desert Roots uses fresh, seasonal fruit instead if a scoop of frozen berries, gives you about twice as much soy yogurt (but if only they had coconut milk yogurt...), and their lightly honey-sweetened homemade granola actually keeps breakfast nutritious, rather than turning it into a total sugar bomb. I'll definitely be ordering the parfait on da regular.  While we're on the subject of carbs, I'd love to see some additional grainless menu items, because as of now, it's entirely carb-based. I enjoy the idea of pasta and cous cous as much as the next person, but I'd rather not eat much of it, let alone make it my meal. Also, stuffing a flour-based wrap with grains is not on my bucket list. Plus, if I get dessert (and I am getting dessert, damn it), that's flour on rice on flour. Yikes. Hook me up with some vegetable/nut/legume-centric dishes and I'll be an ecstatic camper in the future. Keep the good stuff coming, y'all, keep it coming.

Known in folklore as a cure-all, the Vovomeenian johnnycake smorgasbord (not the right word to use, since it means bread and butter, but let's just run with it) offers life-replenishing powers for uninspired, hung over, and weary brunch soldiers. The legend says... "Add four poached eggs to this. And a Portuguese doughnut."   So I did. The dish is just called "johnnycakes." You know, john·ny·cake - noun - a flat cornmeal cake typically baked or fried on a griddle.  I received two, plate-sized. Studded with corn. Stacked with fresh strawberries. Oh, and scoop of sweet rice pudding. Plus, two sausages. And a pitcher of prickly pear maple syrup. So, when you order the johnnycakes, know that it may be a working title, and that the definition is approximate at best.   Use this flexibility to your advantage and continue adding brunch items with reckless abandon. Don't think about it.* I recommend four poached eggs and a doughnut.  *Unless you have something to do in the next four hours, besides for nap.

If you're a party of two, Davanti isn't really "tapas"... it's bigger. That being said, I shared five plates with my date. We couldn't finish dessert, which is saying something (and by "something" I mean I went into a cheese coma post-meal).Go with a larger party to taste more dishes without accidentally eating to the point of no return after only ordering a few.  We started with the cannellini bean vasi. The spread was creamy, smoky, and studded with purple onion. A stack of really crunchy toasts drizzled with olive oil were served on the side. The oil seemed like overkill, but it didn't subtract from the dish, so all is forgiven. Next up was the most significant thing that happened to my tastebuds/me in general all week.   Enter truffle egg toast. Soft yolk, fontina, truffle, asparagus. This plate was definitely smaller than the rest, but it was exceptionally rich and complex. I'm ordering this for myself and stabbing anyone who tries to "share" with my fork next time. We went for the homemade ricotta gnocchi afterwards, which was a great mix - eggplant, tomato, garlic, and fresh, melty mozzarella. The ricotta gave the dumplings a slightly fluffier texture, but it wasn't a huge deviation from the standard. Overall, the mozzarella definitely made the dish.  Last but most, dessert. First up, the goat cheesecake was crustless, topped with caramel and almond brittle. It had a very light texture and musky, rich flavor which needed the sweet contrast of the caramel and brittle. The almond brittle added a lot, and in the future, I'd ask for extra. The Purple Pig was two slices of super crunchy, grilled bread with a dollop of Nutella, homemade marshmallow fluff, and bananas in the center. Simple, delicious, and passable as lunch? Maybe? It's worth a shot.  Everyone was attentive and happy to answer questions, but they wore basketball shorts, were covered in tats and piercings, and just were not givin' a sh*t about their presentation. At an upscale restaurant, it was a refreshing twist that made Davanti feel far from uptight. 'Twas unconventional but thoroughly enjoyable, much like everything else. I'll definitely be back in the market for some of that again soon.

From the Big Star to the Casanova, Federal pizza is not f*ckin' around.  Crust: perfectly thin and crispy. Toppings: top-notch and distributed evenly. Cheese: a solid reason to get up in the morning.   Overall: bring it all on, 'cause I'm going to finish it before I roll outta this biznitch. Leftovers are for the weak when you're dealing with pizza this rightfully grandiose.

There's bad service, and then there's service that makes you go "booooo-sheeeyt!"   Imagine you tell the waitress that 3/4 of your table is vegetarian/vegan/Kosher right at the beginning of the meal. Cool. Done.  You ask about the tots of the day and she says they're chile verde... fair game. You eat the tots, and you're all like, "This tastes like dead thing." And then she's like, "Oh yeah, there's pork in those."   So then you're mortified and apologetic to your dinner guests and just trying not to yell a Ludacris-style "WADAF*****CK?!"  She takes them away and you go, "Uhh, can we just have fries instead?" So she brings them out, and then charges you for the tots AND the fries. No.  Boooooooooo-sheeeeeeeyt.

THRIVE...IN TEMPE?! As in, we don't have to make a weekly voyage to Gilbert for a bowl of all things pure and wonderful? I'll eat to that. Their expanded menu, simplified bowl sizes, and convenient location are all improvements from the original location, which was already worthy of copious amounts of praise.  If you don't know what an acai bowl is, use the appeal of the mystery to transport yourself there. If you do know, be warned: Thrive beats the Brazilian version, the SoCal version, and everything in between when it comes to mastering the acai bowl. Addiction is definitely in your future.  With flavors like blackberry walnut, chocolate coconut, and every super-food add-in under the sun, it's no wonder this college-town newcomer is already a total hit amongst hippies, hipsters, and sorostitutes alike. With enough support, perhaps my ultimate dream of Thrive running every crappy FroYo place into the ground might just come true.

Want to pretend to be healthy? Now you can! And ChopShop can help. Here's how:  1) Order a kale caesar.  2) Throw in some delicious, protein-packed shrimp. Really, the shrimp are excellent. Skip the tofu.  3) Enjoy the full cup of caesar dressing that's suffocating the life out of each and every piece of kale and coating your mouth in a film best described as what every salad at the most mediocre chain restaurant in the world tastes like.  4) Delude yourself into thinking that a bowl of dressing, flecked with green, is good for you.  Seriously, if you're going to down a thousand calories of salty fat, just get a cheeseburger and fries and enjoy the hell out of it. Never has ordering a salad made me want to skip dessert, until now.

Grilled goat cheese with butternut, cran-pear relish, and spiced pecans on 9-grain... Festive, but you know what'll really take that vegetarian grilled cheese up a notch? Ditching the squash and adding BBQ pork ribs.*  Since these sammies take a small eternity to come out, don't stay together well, and cost a pretty 1,000 pennies, I have to dock a couple stars. The BBQ rib creation really is fairly tasty, though.  *may not be vegetarian according to certain standards.

This little fitbetch-hub is Arcadia in all the right ways... give it a shot next time you're overcome with a sense of claustrophobia and dread when someone invites you to LGO for lunch.  These are some of the crucial inquiries one must make when analyzing the iconic veggie burger, including: is it bland, pretending to be meat, as unhealthy as a regular cheeseburger, and/or a uniform ball of mush? s.e.e.d. gives a resounding "nah" to all.  Quinoa patties are inherently squishy, but s.e.e.d. uses bread so toasted that you still get the ideal ratio of o.h.y.e.a.h. *action movie announcer voice* Super-toasty 9-grain. Soft, spiced quinoa patty. Avocado. Tomato. Vegan chive mayo. Red pepper tapenade. Melty vegan cheese. Available now.  P.S. - bonus points for stevia & almond milk at the coffee bar.

"You are alive. And you stand up and see the heat lamps on the patio and the people on Mill Avenue that make you wonder. And you're listening to that song, and eating that mac 'n' cheese burrito stuffed with green chile and shrimp. And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite." - Perks of Being a Wallflower

The Stand exists in a time/space warp that makes it sound like "Wouldn't It Be Nice" is always playing. You're slightly concerned a seagull might jack your fries. There's just a little bit of sand under your nails. It's several decades ago.   Time moves slower, service moves correspondingly. Burgers and fries are done simply and well, with no attempts at extra flare - unless you count Stand Sauce. It's not bare bones, it's classic in a way that makes one nostalgic for the idea of a time they may or may not have actually lived in.   Overall, it's a welcome helping of affordable simplicity in a culinary wonderland neighborhood laden with more expensive, modern burger-things.

The prophecy has been fulfilled. I have been waiting for Bragg's Pie Factory to contain pies for the last decade, at least. Not only does it now contain pie, but delicious pies, just like your (secretly vegan) grandma used to make.  Oh, and it's a diner with a stellar breakfast menu. Aside from the fact that the waitress knew absolutely nothing about anything on the menu or what anything was made of or what things tasted like (or maybe even where she was), Bragg's put on a jolly good show.  First up: the coconut curry waffle, made with coconut milk instead of buttermilk and spiced up with a little curry powder. 'Twas creative and tasty, but could've used a little coconut on top. Next up were the banana flax pancakes. They were deliciously soft and fluffy and gooey and sweet... that said, I'm not sure that more soft, gooey, sweet bananas on top were necessary. Adding pecans, flax granola, or streusel would remedy the repetitive textures. And be generally awesome.  We also tried the cornmeal biscuit with gravy and eggplant bacon. The texture of the eggplant was nowhere near bacon, but the flavor totally was. Smokey goodness: nailed it. I was most impressed by this combination in terms of flavors, uniqueness, and the rarity of finding such a typically non-vegan creation in a vegan establishment. For dessert: blueberry and blackberry pie with a sweet, crumby, soft crust. There were whole berries in the pie. There was no gelatin. There was pie in the pie factory... and all was well in the land of my stomach.

Put on your most expensive dark wash jeans and pay homage to "so Scottsdale" at EVO, in all the best ways.  The name, combined with the upscale-casual, verging-on-tacky-but-still-posh vibes you sense upon entry should immediately tip you off. This place is Scottsdale as fuhhh, but then, the hip music selection and chic booths ease you into it, and you're like, "yeah. I can dig this."  Fast forward four and a half minutes: you're ordering bruschetta of the day (ours had pea shoots and crab), kale salad (complete with crispy brussels sprouts, pear, goat cheese, and pine nuts), and trendy thin crust pizzas. You're sipping something bubbly. Life is good.   Finish the experience full force and hop in your BMW, head back to NoSco, and watch Orange is the New Black on Tivo. Doze off peacefully on your Tempurpedic, memories of good times at EVO floating through your perfect little head.

My pulled pork sandwich at Bootleggers wasn't fatty. "Fatty" implies some sort of holy union between tender shreds of protein and slow-cooked, melty lipid. Fat was on one side of the arena. Protein was on the other. I was picking wads of cholesterol-flavored chewing gum out from between the kaiser roll, which was very soft and brioche-y (you know, to enhance the mushy fat aspect of the experience.)  Now look, I ain't a bitch. I like fat. I also like chips, so you know there's a problem when the greasiness from the chips is actually about to saturate and capsize the sandwich. Few things deter me from putting chips on a sandwich.  Moving on from the first-world problems and onto the first world solutions, the coleslaw on the sandwich was excellent in all the ways. The pork itself, as well as the flavor, was good. I actually found the huge, unshredded chunks to be the best part, since I didn't have to worry about trimming them first.   SPOILER ALERT: Happy ending! Basically, my persnicketry saved me from expelling food in public or having to go get a coronary artery bypass graft. (Day ruiner, am I right?) So naturally I got a blueberry & peach cobbler with ice cream afterwards. Super sweet, very comforting, and the topping was made of mutilated cinnamon toast crunch. Novel.

Healthy, nutritious, filling, simple.   Because there's the option to create your own bowl, the potential for things to go awry is there. If you don't trust yourself, just order one of the set items on the menu. You can always get a little crazy and sub out proteins for one another.  I had quinoa + salmon + kale + pistachios + avocado + and some Asian-y dressing, and it totally hit the spot. Could I have made it myself? Yes, but WOULD I have made it myself is the real question.  Overall? grabbagreen is worth the 10 buckaroos if you order shrimp or salmon in your bowl. Otherwise, I'd call it steep, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and pressed for time.

This quintessential Roosevelt stoner dream hut is a welcomed, unique addition to the surprisingly limited Phoenix ice cream scene.  First things first: the ice cream here IS unusually soft; however, it doesn't actually melt faster, so it's okay if you're feeling a little... zoned out. With a variety of flavors paying homage to the munchies (our favorites being Cocoa Puffs, caramel popcorn, chocolate brownie, and mint chocolate cookie), be forewarned: shit is intense. Oh, and despite being visually off-putting, the un-waffled (crepe?) cone is top-notch. Plus, there's a wee 'shmallow stuck in the bottom.  The folks inside cheerily slung samples, had helpful opinions, and even complimented the local competition. I stifled laughter as an elderly gentleman ordered "a couple Molly waters," and lost count of the "Fuck Trump" stickers while waiting in line. The vibe at Melt isn't for everyone (i.e. those voting for Trump, or those who just associate 4:20 with getting to leave the 9-5 early), but I doubt there's a soul out there that wouldn't benefit from some Molly water and sugar cereal ice cream on a hot summer/spring/fall/winter day/night.

"It's a hot dog... with BBQ... wrapped in naan... covered in crackerjacks... and peanut butter... and cheese. Also, doughnuts. No, I'm not kidding."   So that's how we decided on Mother's Day brunch.   Two bratwurst Bears, a Sunny, and a Lady later, we were full, but not quitting. Sunny (prosciutto, greens, honey, goat cheese, good times) was a favorite, but I was intrigued by the promise of crackerjacks on the Bear. 'Twas so filling.   Speaking of fillings, the custard-filled coffee cake doughnut is stonery-brilliant-phenomenal and the spicy Thai doughnut is pleasant-aromatic-exotic. If you like your doughnuts how you like your men, these fit the bill... but if you like your doughnuts how you like your hot dogs, the Bear also comes in doughnut form.   Nothing was a miss, but the Sunny and coffee cake doughnut would be my top picks in future. Overall, this place successfully made naan-believing wiener-eaters out of us.

The name hardly covers it.  Between the Thai Margarita and the Conflagration Nation, you'll end up with drinks, a show, and a lifelong friend behind the bar. I suggest sitting at the counter if you like science/fire/enthusiasm/alcohol (or any safe and fun combination therein.) The vanilla pipe tobacco-burning skillet bonfire and the herb-slapping ceremony are not to be missed, and if you play your cards right, you may end up with some off-the-menu taste bud titillation.  Good food? Well, gladly, yes. Free food? Graciously, thanks. But, pistachio chicken liver pate as a personal gift from Tim, server-prince-among-men? Good God, gloriously, yes. "Hillbilly Eggrolls," a la Little Miss BBQ's private reserve of the best meat on Earth, nestled inside a crispy crunch-cave, surrounded by a mote of inspired accoutrements? Hallelujah, GLADLY. Braised short ribs with roasted veg-action, pecans, and fig-raisin relish delicately walked the line of sweet and savory - the perfect finish, despite the urge to order literally everything off the menu.   A return visit? Gladly in order.

Silence the conversation about the Valley's best hangover breakfast.  If I can only get it on Saturday or Sunday, if I have to wait an hour, or if it's not served after 11 a.m., it's not "the best."  Finally, I can find salvation in my hour of need... which happened to be at 1 p.m. on a Tuesday. NO, I don't wan't to talk about it. Anyway, back to salvation: Alo's Waffle Cristo. Start with a waffle + ham + turkey (or just twice the ham if you're awesome) + swiss cheese + egg. Top it with berry jam + sour cream + maple syrup.   Seven days a week, until 3 p.m., you too, can be absolved of your sins by the (Jesus H.) Waffle Cristo.

Back when I was a youngin', the closest place to get an acai bowl was in San Diego. As California's exponentially lamer, younger sibling, Arizona has finally hopped on the bandwagon.   We may never have an ocean, but acai blended with bananas, dates, strawberries, peanut butter and vanilla cashew milk, topped with hemp seed granola and bananas ain't a half-bad consolation prize.  Much love and appreciation (/primal cravings) for Nekter and their phenomenal peanut butter acai bowl.

There are so many reasons I hate that Jewel's has the best chicken and waffles of all time. 1. It's not a chicken 'n' waffles place. There are plenty of chicken 'n' waffles places. This is better. 2. Everything is entirely gluten-free. Even when I factor that culinary feat out of the equation, this dish is best in show. As I'm shoving a fluffy, crispy Belgian waffle into my face hole, I find myself wondering why gluten even exists.  3. It's a bakery, but the meat is better than most restaurants. The chicken is tender, boneless, and there are no bad pieces. The fried coating is entirely crispy and incredibly flavorful. Ask for extra. It doesn't come with all that much, and you'll want it. 4. It's not a Southern joint, but you get warm buttermilk syrup and Sriracha honey, and it beats hot sauce and honey by miles (coming from a Nashville native, tail betwixt legs.) 5. The whole thing is topped off with crispy kale pieces, which, despite seeming superfluous, is entirely necessary and adds a fantastic, toasty flavor. 6. There are too many insane-looking desserts not to get one. The creamy lemon meringue with graham crust is superior to the slightly gummy apple pie, but if you're limited to GF goodies, they'll be the best you eva had. I put Jewel's up against "normal" bakeries because nothing about them reminds me they're gluten-free.  However, the comprehensive experience is a mixed bag. On my first visit, the kitchen staff called out, "we can't make that. The iron broke." And the cashier simply said, "so... what can I get you that's not chicken and waffles?" The blasé shut-down sans any alternative offerings was a bummerdrag, especially since we came specifically to try that dish. (As substitute-for-waffle items go, the fine-crumb biscuits are awesome. The eggy, but basic, French toast doesn't pair quite as well.) Another time, the staff had little clue what was in the pastry case, and despite nothing requiring prep, took 10 minutes to get two pieces of pie to our table. This would be ignorable if there were more than three people in the café. The ambiance is basic, and like most Arizona things, Jewel's is in a strip mall. Fanf*ckingtastic food combined with hum-dum everything else earns an emotionally-conflicted four stars from me, because Jewel's really does have the best chicken and waffles I've ever had.

So I'm trying to be a douche and park at George & Dragon, because I hate all things valet (it's complimentary, you just have to pay for it!) The valet sees me and is all, "Hey, are you going to Clever Koi? You can't park there." And I'm like, "Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?"** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.  *I said literally none of this. **I silently complied.   Moving on, it's happy hour. I order only full-priced drinks because I don't understand money. Fill Collins and Slippin' Jimmy are both exceptional, and I would've drank more if I didn't have to go to another thing to drink more after. The server, noticing our enthusiasm (and dashing good looks) recommended we sit at the bar and get creative with the bartender, which is 100% on for next time.  Edible portion:  - Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken.   - Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar. - Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential.  - Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time.  - Honorable mention: server candy! Man buns, septum piercings, gauges, and tattoos galore. The waiters were 104% more fun to look at than the guests.  5 stars cocktailery & server candy, 3.5 star food. Come for happy hour, stay for the other stuff.

The first step to recovery is indulgence, right? I've been trying to free myself of some nasty BBQ cravings for some time now (by eating it constantly, of course), but I swear the hankerings get stronger by the day.  Maybe if Little Miss BBQ wasn't capable of giving dead meat more life than when it used to be an animal, I'd have gotten it out of my system by now.  Seriously, I've had BBQ from at least a six places in the last month, and (dirty, saucy, smoky) hands down... Little Miss takes the cake. And then throws the cake out the window and replaces it with some epic BBQ. You didn't even want cake.  From the brisket, to the pulled pork, to the sauce drippin' down this slaw, all us fans yee-haw. Or make whatever noise is necessary to get more food. The turkey was the best I've ever had - so savory and magnificent - sorry every Thanksgiving ever. The fatty brisket was essentially a chocolate truffle in cow form. I want to try all the creations, and since samples were kindly offered, I'm on my way to achieving that goal.  I ended up getting both the lean brisket and the turkey with heaps of glorious cole slaw and drowning it all in a harmonious yin yang of sweet and tangy mustard and BBQ sauce. I also "helped" my friend out with her pulled pork sandwich. Every bite was better than the last, and then it was gone. As soon as I find stomach space, round II is on.

You know what's bitter and twisted? Calling this vintage cocktail parlor-themed restaurant/bar mitzvah party/late night Vegas hotel joint nonsense a cocktail parlor.   Of course, my imagination had me like... dark, smoky New Orleans-hotel-bar circa 1910? Just let me grab my brand new cigarette holder, darling.  *record spins to a scratchy stand-still*  Fast-forward: It's 2015, and the most consumable thing at this restaurant is a ramen burger. A gastropub-tastic, spicy, juicy burger between crisp ramen patties, served with moist wipes for your sauce-covered paws. The tagine, which was was described to us as having "Moroccan sauce on it," was also a contender. (Vivid description provided by suspender-clad angel.)  But wait - the drinks! The corpse reviver reminded me of weak jungle juice delivered in a glass vessel. The Ramos gin fizz was perfectly mediocre, but isn't on the menu, and was served in about 5 minutes (as in, no shaker boy spent more than 30 seconds shaking it.) Welp, we definitely ain't in New Orleans, anymo'.  The tagline is "drink better," but some of us would have to first drink far worse in order to drink better at B&T.

Sunday Barbecue at OHSO! For $15, you get all'a dis (with refills! You probably won't want a refill, though, unless you're an Ork.) - 2 BBQ chicken breasts - Pulled pork - BBQ brisket  - Cornbread - Baked beans - Spicy green apple slaw - Potato salad - Lima beans and corn  For those of us with a substantial, but more human-person-like appetite, there's the BBQ Bacon Burger: - aforementioned menu description words - Crunchy onion straws - American cheese (the good kind)  The Sunday Barbecue plate is a ball-out-all-you-can-eat-treat, but I think the BBQ Bacon Burger was one of the best that I've had. Between the all-American Southern comfort food, the buzzin' flies, and the friendly-but-slightly-awkward service, I felt just like I was at a new neighbor's BBQ. Consider this my RSVP to the next one.

Remember Nutty Buddies/Drumsticks/those things? Imagine a made-to-order rendition, mostly organic, not irreparably freezer burned in a 94-pack from Costco (ah, the summers of my youth...) You can totally get that at Shakes & Cones, but I have no idea what it tastes like.   That was the plan, but then we sat down with a "Vanutzel - Nutella, chocolate pretzels, vanilla soft serve - 12 oz." (watching the figure, obviously.) And "Also, the Texas chocolate sheet cake with swirl soft serve ice cream and peanuts and whipped cream, add chocolate pretzels."   Highlights: happy family-run (mom's due in two weeks!), fragrant vanilla soft serve, salty chocolate pretzels, peanuts, organic whipped cream, rewards card to fuel the addiction. I could've done without the super sugary sheet cake and the chocolate soft serve, but didn't do without, and ate all of it.  So yeah.  I'll get to the Nutty Buddy Renaissance eventually... until then, I may have lost my Cakes & Shame privileges.

Eating dinner on the patio, now with buzzwords:  Greenery and heat lamps shroud our enclave. Sensory overwhelm pre-meal..? Rare, but well-done.  Pillows, just Moroccan enough. 90's alternative music, just loud enough.  Chef Chris's Char Siu ribs: next time, I won't share. Tattooed server with sometimes-British accent... actually, I'd share with you.  Strings of glowing bulbs, twinkling above fried chicken and cornbread. An added side of honey, just because we can.  Damn, this lighting's got me waxing-poetic. Or is just this warm 'smores cake-in-a-jar?  A vanilla creme brûlée, delicate and fragrant.  We fade out to Bush's "Glycerine."  Tl;dr: a glorious hodgepodge of cultural cluster, too tasteful to be random.  If this is what we're calling New American... bring it on, New America.

I approach Diego from the side of the bar. My pickup line? Entirely unoriginal, but you can hear the sincerity in my voice. "Where are you from?" I ask, mystified by ethnic ambiguity.   He laughs. "Half-Mexican, half-Hawaiian," he says in a way where I can tell he's been asked that question by many a suitor before me.  After a whirlwind of an evening with the Mexican Trail Mix Salad, topped with adobo BBQ chicken (a plethora of green things, crunchy things, fruity things, and a tangy bird), I'm left with a sudden realization.   It may have only been one night, and sure, I only know half of Diego (and I couldn't even tell you whether or not it's his better half) but hell, I'm in it, and I'm in it to win it.

Inconsistent, though friendly service/execution/setup/flair pulls 3 stars, but delicious solutions made of beer chicken gets four.   Play-by-play:  I delicately ask if there are any medieval turkey legs atop a waffle available, without getting my hopes up.   I am informed that yes, I can acquire said dish!   I order two immediately. Hopes way up now.  I am re-informed that the kitchen is actually out of turkey legs.  Before I can cry audibly, they counter with the IPA chicken atop a waffle.   I order two immediately.   Solid four stars for a fantastic meal coupled with an emotional roller coaster of broken promises.

Every other establishment on earth that successfully sizzled their way into the upper echelon of quintessential fried foods committed to making chicken OR doughnuts really, really well. The magic of Welcome C+D is in the "+"  Welcome Chicken + Doughnuts is obliterating "or" as a conjunction altogether. You get to have it all, without sacrificing your standards for obnoxiously hip, artisan doughnuts that are ring-shaped renditions of craft cocktails and high quality, free range, bilingual chickens doused in authentic, savory Asian sauces.  So while indulging my "ind" (a culinary-Freudian fusion of "and" + "id," which, yes, I did just make up for this occasion) I opted for chicken + doughnuts. In fact, I had Korean + Japanese chicken, of which the salty sweetness of the Japanese BBQ paired best with doughnuts. Between the breast + drum, the breast was more tender and meaty. Between cucumber salad + buttered corn, the warm, comforting flavor and texture of the corn won my vote. I also had pb&j + blueberry cacao + lemon gingerbread + maple bacon, but blacked out between the third and fourth doughnut, meaning more R+D is in order.   The Japanese BBQ fried chicken breast paired with buttered corn is my pick as of now, but I genuinely appreciate that Welcome C+D lets me have it all. As long as they supply a deep fryer and a dream, I'll supply cash and jubilant lack of self-control.

This is a normal lunch place with normal sandwiches, they're just superior in all ways.   The bread is the best thing since sliced bread. Inside, no compromise on quality is made. There's just enough plant-thing and spice element to add interest, but not to distract from the purity of the main ingredients. Meats and cheeses are thoughtfully combined and generally the bee's knees (like turkey from Little Miss BBQ.)   Noble is a standard-setter. There's nothing extra, nothing shmancy, but nothing is left to be desired.

New York's hottest club is: Counter Intuitive.  This club has everything: it's in Phoenix, it's actually a bar, and it's themed like a New Orleans estate sale of a fictional/deceased Bartholomew Chesterfield Ignatius Sugarman, who may or may not be a midget.   The theme will change right when you get used it, and you'll love it.   It has obituaries, bacon beignets, and drinks that taste like effervescent Flintstones vitamin molly water.   This club has a Peas-Sco Sour with snap-pea infused pisco, egg white, watermelon, & yuzu.   It has whiskey, tequila, pineapple, lime, AND coffee liqueur in a melee of hell yessery.   It's website-less, it's late-night, it's weekend-only, it's the brainlovechild of Cowboy Ciao + Crudo collaboration, and anyone who's everyone is there.

An enchanted evening of whimsy, wonder, and getting wasted.   Hendrick's aesthetic is impossibly detailed in a vintage-quirky-magical way (think hot air balloon graphics and croquet mallet cocktail stirrers.) I'm considering getting a full sleeve composed exclusively of the art on the goodie bags we were presented with upon arrival.    A few tipples, 36 salmon finger sandwiches, and several dozen fig & goat cheese toasts later, MixMasterMark walked straight out of the 19th century and into the Gladly. He led us through the history of Hendrick's (Scottish/2 stills/master ladychemist/botanicals on fleek.)   Then, we drank. On each table was an array of equipment, simple syrups, fresh fruits, ice, gin and juice... laid back. We made each cocktail after MMM demo'd with flair and finesse. There was merrymaking, liberal gin slinging, lemon juice flying, and selfies on selfies on selfies.   A cucumber lemonade, groovy blueberry green tea lemonade, group project bowl of do-drink-the-punch, and several off-centered high fives later, we were unleashed into The Gladly (with more punch.) Mac 'n' cheese and Brussels sprouts over grits at the bar sealed off the session with a resounding hell yes.   I was already a fan of both Hendrick's and The Gladly, but this weekend I'm gladly buying a bottle of Hendrick's.
