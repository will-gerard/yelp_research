I come here for lunch about once a week. The food is great, but the reason I come back is the people. They are always fast and helpful. Many place in the area have dumb worthless employees (Einstein's Bagels). I recommend the fish burrito!

This is the type of place we should support in the economic times we are in. A family owned and operated business with GREAT food, for a fair price, with friendly service. They dont hassle you will bull$#!t promotions like the major chains do. I eat here as often as I can.

We went to TAO 5/25/13 for my brothers bachelor party. As the best man it was my job to plan. I googled Vegas pool parties and found jackcolton.com The site provides contact info for club promoters and VIP services.   I emailed Matt Pearson from VIP Services at TAO about my options. We had 16 guys, and anyone can tell you, that's a nightmare to get in to a club, especially on a holiday weekend.   Matt was awesome, he gave me several cost options for table/bottle service, he met us at the door and got us right in, and once we got to our table, the service was awesome. I definitely recommend any group and certainly any group of guys contact Matt.   Matt.Pearson@taogroup.com

Every Sunday I travel 15 miles for the best coffee in AZ. I love D'Lish and I love to see a local restaurant do well. Thanks for opening your doors!

Awful!!! Why am I waiting 20 minutes for a bagel! Everyone should cross the 101 and got to Big City Bagels!! They have friendly, FAST service. Support local business owners! Einstein's made me wait 20 minutes and then they gave me the wrong bagel!!! I blame the owner!!!!

You would think in North Scottsdale, an honest person could leave their sunglasses on the table by accident, come back the next day they would have been saved by the waiter or the bus-boy. NOT AT SALTY'S. THEY ARE THIEVES! Not to mention the food is aweful, and the staff could care less about service.

Went to eat at Daphnes last night with my girlfreind. The food was awesome and the employee's were very helpful. The manager recomended a dinner special. The special was a ton of food for cheap! Got eat!

The BEST gyro in scottsdale, the people are very friendly and 90% of the time they do a great job. Once in a while during the lunch rush, the food takes too long, but its only happened to me twice. I still love to eat here.

I don't get it? Is this supposed to be delicious soul food? Its a crap piece of chicken and a crap waffle on a plate for 8 bucks. The water is from the tap. I expected delicious, I got below average at best. Back to the real restaurants for me.
