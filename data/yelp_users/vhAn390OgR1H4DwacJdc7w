So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a "better" idea and suggested Athenian Express.  As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)  http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090  In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.  We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.  http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122  Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.  http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658  As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of "gyro meat" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.  I move on to my side of potato salad.  http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283  Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.  Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.  http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387  I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it.

If you don't like costco, you have serious issues.  First of all, what I love about costco is that their products are so across-the-board good that I don't even care how much it costs.  But it is a pretty inexpensive place to go, particularly if you buy in bulk.  If you were to talk to Dallas G., he would tell you that costco pizza is the best thing in the whole world.  I wouldn't go that far but I would say that it's delightful.  Other things you can eat from there:  rotisserie chicken--still the best I've found french feta cheese--creamy and delicious their kirkland whole grain bread--no hf corn syrup and 5g of fiber per slice all of the meals in the back that you just throw in the oven their pecans their strawberries their wines their kirkland vodka their buttercream cakes OMG their big ass bags of mexican cheese blends etc., etc.  But I want to point one thing out: the very best thing at costco is the steak.  Whether it's the 6-7 lb beef tenderloin (the least attractive piece of meat you'll ever cook), the 4 pack of filets mignons, or the four pack of ribeyes, I truly mean that this is the best steak you will find in the city.  You just have to grill it yourself.  And don't be a philistine.  Medium rare, tops.

Well...  I was told to go to this place by none other than Gabi M., because I am a philistine and I had no idea it existed.  But I didn't go right away.  Which was my loss, because this place is phenomenal.  I finally ended up here somewhat fortuitously because a student of mine suggested it.  Anyway...  I've been doing this phoenix biggest loser thing because my wife says I'm the biggest loser in phoenix, so when Amber W. started up a competition with the same name I figured hell, I can win that.  Turns out it's about weight loss and so that pretty much means I'm screwed on the $25 entry fee.  Well I wasn't until I went here.  My diet was doing very well, thank you, *until* I went to LGO.  As soon as I walked in I was met with a tsunami of poor health choices and didn't know just how to hold it together.  Pumpkin-chocolate chunk muffin? Blackberry bran muffin? (Which I ordered because bran=fiber=healthy, der!) Strawberry muffin? Cream cheese coffee cake?!?! and a million more delightful delicacies which tempted me for forty seconds before I gave in.  Well not really.  Here's how it went down: I held firm and got oatmeal with bananas, strawberries, and raisins.  Spare me the nutritionist's take, I'm confident that was the best I could do.  So I was pretty proud of myself.  But I *did* have to bring home a muffin to my wife because that story about her saying I was a big loser was a lie and she's actually pretty great.  So I paid for the strawberry muffin but at the last minute changed to blackberry bran at an employee's recommendation and GOD DAMN i am glad i did because that is probably the best muffin I ever had.  Note: Since the charming Gabi M. decided to laugh at me for my food choices *all night* at the OYE I will point out that I ate only 3/7 of the muffin.  That's it!  that's like, um, a 57% healthy choice based on my math.  Anyway my student had an english muffin with avocado and smoked salmon that I was looking lustily at so she told me that I *must* have an english muffin.  She bought a pack and gave me two (I'm a good tutor evidently) and so of COURSE I HAD to eat one.  I say that defensively because Gabi laughed at me for the english muffin too.  I'm scarred.  Anyway.... I know this review is dragging because my wife is now watching Lifetime which means that her head is being filled with all sort of anti-man propaganda as I type.  So I'll wrap it up:   Today we went there and I had a croque madame which is a whole grain open face deal with ham and tomato and mustard and a sunny side up egg.  Pretty damn good.  But we also had the strawberry muffin which was a little disappointing: not moist enough and not strawberry-y enough.  So I give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and I don't think I could eat everything I wanted to eat there if I went in for 14 days straight.  I loved it.  And for the acting on Lifetime, one star.  And the writing: "I love billy, but I love you more." "Really?" "Really."  Pulitzer prize stuff, that.

What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:  "I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are."  Also: "I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it."  And: "I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?"  Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.  Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.  But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.  When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.  The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.  Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Which is why you see two stars here.  In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.  A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.

I can assure you that I was pretty much the biggest pain in the ass customer in the history of this place.  Mainly because they put coleslaw on their sandwiches, and I really detest coleslaw.  But when I found out just how prohibitive that was, I relented and ordered the capastrami (i think) which was pastrami, swiss, russian dressing, and coleslaw.  And much to my surprise, it was actually really damn good.  Please note: this is the first time in about 25 years that I've voluntarily eaten coleslaw.  But it worked with the sandwich, and worked well.  They have a sandwich on the menu, the bobbie, that is turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and one other thing and they claim that that is a really great sandwich.  Perhaps next time... although I might have a hard time forgoing the capastrami.

I've been criticized for rating too many places 5 stars, and I rebut: that's because I don't eat at crappy places.  You think you are a food snob?  Pah.  You are nothing in your snobbery.  I am an everything snob, so when it comes to food, which is what I do best, all of my other practiced, routine snobbiness comes flooding to the fore.  This makes me the best ever decider of whether or not something is tasty.  You, whoever you may be, are not.  I'm sorry, but there has to be a best of everything, and I am best at this.  So to those of you who have not given cheba hut five stars, there are only three possibilities: either you visited them on an off day, you didn't try the east coastern (pastrami with mozzarella, mustard, pepperoncinis, toasted on garlic sub roll with everything--mayo, vinegar and oil, black olives, pickle, parmesan cheese, oregano, and probably a little love), or you know nothing at all about food.  The place needs cleaning, I admit.  But that is the theme.  And while I find it funny that an entire restaurant can be themed after all things stoner, replete with more euphemisms than you could ever dream of for weed, it neither adds to nor detracts from my rating or overall opinion of the place.  No, the subs here are sensational, made with just the right amount of everything all heaped on to whichever bread you choose.  Maybe you aren't creative enough for cheba hut.  Maybe you just don't really see what it's all about.  I can't tell you if that is or isn't true.  But what I can say is that if you don't think the food here is great, you're wrong.  I'm sorry.

I was leaving the bank when a roach that was about five inches long crawled across the tile.  Being the man that I am, I diverted my course and walked fifty feet out of the way to avoid it.  The nice woman that was helping Dallas G and me set up our account smote the roach with a rebel yell and two strikes of her foot.  one star, only because I can't put zero stars

I have been going to Eric at the Gemsetter for years.  I bought my wife's engagement ring there.  I told him what I wanted it to look like and he made it happen.  I have purchased anniversary gifts there, diamond earrings there, and the gift I gave my wife when she had our first baby.  In short, the Gemsetter is the place I go whenever I need to get any jewlery of any kind.  Another added bonus is that since we got our wedding rings there, they will always clean them for free for us, and I've even taken in watches that I didn't buy there and they worked on them.  Customer service is personal and genuine and the prices are good.

It concerns me that I call myself a food snob and then give red robin five stars.  but: did you have the burger I just had there?  I can slum it with the best of them but the reason why RR gets the big five stars from me is that even though it's not high rent, the food is really fucking tasty.  to wit: today I had a burger with a fried egg on it, with three strips of bacon.  Delicious.  Sloppy.  Hot.  Tasty.  Fatty.  Perfect.  Really, I can tell you that that burger is one of the better burgers I've ever eaten.  It also comes with these garlic parmesan fries that are hell on your co-workers' olfactory sensibilities but what have they done for me lately?  I have, many times, had the california chicken burger--sloppy, with guacamole and bacon and it is really damn good.  I know, I know, how dare I?  Well I dare, bitch.  I dare.  Plus the fries are free refills.

You may ask what more there is to say about Pick Up Stix than what chris r has already said, and ordinarily you'd be right.  But my experience there compels me to write so much more...  So we walked up to the door.  I'm right handed so I pulled on the right door, but it didn't open.  Then I pushed.  No open.  Was there a sign?  No.  But ppl were working inside, so i went to the left door and it worked.  Next, I went to order.  Order our house special!! Okay, sure.  Tell me what it looks like.  So the lady points at the pic on the menu, a dish replete with veggies and meat and sauce.  Then she tells me that the house special does not have any veggies in it except green onions.  Ooooooookay...  So i order something else, whatever it was.    Three weeks later our food comes...  It included an egg roll which didn't taste like the typical egg roll.  Appropriate, because it was served with (*outrage!*) yellow sweet and sour sauce!    Look.  This isn't food network, and you aren't iron chef.  You are pick up stix and your s&s sauce should be that recognizable, iridescent red like all other s&s sauces.  don't trip.  The rest of the food was in a soup of goo that made the flavor pretty uniformly overpowering and unsavory.  Don't go to pick up stix.  You have been duly warned.  (Good for: Breakfast___ Lunch___ Dinner___Brunch___Late Night___Dessert___Nothing_X_)    UPDATE: 4 hours later, my mouth still smells like an elephant ate a pound of garlic and then crapped in my mouth.  My wife refuses to be near me.  My two month old cries when I try to hold him.  I'm a pariah.  Thank you, pick up stix.

Liberty Market is owned by Joe Johnston, of Joe's Real BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill.  But imho his real claim to fame is the fact that he was one of the founders of Coffee Plantation--if you can remember as far back as when CP was actually a great place to go.  If you head into Liberty Market, you'll find an espresso bar with an old-school machine making pretty tasty drinks, including store-made proprietary hot chocolate (which was a hallmark of Coffee Plantation.  Starbucks?  Pah).  My wife, co-yelping, says the baked goods are better than the food, and since the red velvet cake is part of that category, I'd have to agree.  The red velvet cake is--and I mean this--the best slice of cake I've ever eaten.  And I've had my fair share.  The cream cheese frosting is fucking ridiculous, it's so creamy and cheesy.  If it were chilled the way such a cake should be (I think their bake case needs repair) I'd seriously go buy three cakes and just eat till I died, Seven style.  But the sandwiches are good too, and the ambience is quaint and charming--as Joe's places always are.  I don't want to wantonly toss my stars out to every half-decent place because let's be honest--not every place is a five-star restaurant.  But this place is pretty damn good and charming, so I'd recommend a visit.  My wife's yelp: "I loved the red velvet cake, very cute place, nice atmosphere."  She's a lover of brevity (and poorly hung yet redeemingly charismatic men).

This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.  So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.  Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.  We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...  the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with "talk to the (paw print)" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.  WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that. HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there. WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay. HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure. WOMAN: (orders fifty more things) HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.) WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back. HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.  So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.  A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?  Fat person code: (I am an authority) 1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake. 2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this. 3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.  Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...  Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset.   There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify "fresh") red velvet cake.  Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.  __________________  **Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promise

A very tasty place for breakfast.  I strenuously object to any place that doesn't serve hash browns, but really that's my only complaint.  They have a ton of different omelets/scrambles (you choose) and you can make your own.  Example: spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese.  As a scramble.  With salsa.  The coffee is good (I hear from my wife) and the cinnamon roll is a real treat.  Not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8.5/10.    It is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure.  You'll be waiting outside.    They grill their wheat toast-solid.

Sorry, Bradford.  I declare war on Target.  Yelp War.  I bought a microwave at target last year in, say, October.  Being that it was manufactured in August, I feel like it's a reasonable thing to think that it should be working in May of 2009.  However, this is not so reasonable.  Now, if I were a retailer of the size and ilk of Target (I even own their stock) and someone bought a piece of garbage from me, I'd take it back, exchange it for a new microwave of the same model and value, and then deal with Sharp on my own since my voice would mean something to them.  But no.  If you haven't a receipt w/in 90 days, it doesn't matter how crappy the merchandise was.  Why don't we just go Wal-Mart and make stuff that will last 91 days so then we can give the big F-You! to all our customers?  It'd be great!  (At Costco, if you buy something that sucks, they take it back, no questions asked.  None.  And I've seen this many times, for things much more valuable than microwaves that don't work.)  So having this standard of comparison, I know that it is possible to take care of a customer, which means that Target powers that be have decided that it just isn't worth it to stand behind their crap.  Well guess what: you just lost my business, and with that dies a little piece of my heart.  You suck, target.  And now Costco gets your business on top of all of that.  May your stores all close (except Brad's) and may your shares plummet to $1.53 before you ditch your senior management and rally to become the store you may have once been and always had the potential to be.  Until that day, sorry Bradford.  Target can kiss my ass.

Only divine Providence, in the form of Xyience Xenergy drinks, could have saved Cobblestone from one-star ignominy.  Because I hate this goddamn place with a passion.  Why?  The gas pumps have a running catalog of three different maladies, depending on the day.  One day, they are out of service.  The next day, they work, but agonizingly slowly.  And on yet another day, they take your card and just freeze, never to return.  It seems to choose just which is the most appropriate torture: if I'm about to run out of gas, I'll see the out of service sign so I have to look for another station.  If I'm in a hurry, I'll put in the card and it will freeze.  And if I'm having a good day, I'll just have to stand out in the heat for six hours waiting for my zip code to go through so I can use the pump.  It's a rather efficient machine of evil.  Fortunately, those cretins indoors are not to be outdone.  If you want to see a mount kilmanjaro of ineptitude, go inside and see how these people run their checkstand.  Four people standing behind the counter at a minimum, and three menial tasks being performed at any one time mean maximum aggravation for the customer.  There's a line out the door?  Okay, but first we must inventory the penny rolls before it's too late.  If there's ever a complaint, or an issue with overcharging or some other chicanery from the morons on the car wash side (see below) then the one person running the register will argue with the customer and let everyone else wait in line and listen.  It's grand.  Still, everyone else will be behind the counter, making sure there's no lint between the cigarette packs in the case.  And oh, for the car wash/lube station.  You could take a brand new car there, show them that the odometer reads 7 miles, and they'd still tell you that if you don't flush the radiator, change the oil, replace the air filter and clean the transmission fluid, you're on a one way trip to a fiery car wreck which will maim, dismember, and otherwise destroy you in every conceivable way.  Good luck trying to tell them not to browbeat you.  "I already got it serviced."  "Really? Where?" And here it comes: how much better they can do for you, and if you let them tack on $150 for a detail they'll save you $75 on the oil change.  TODAY ONLY!!!  No, thank you.  If it didn't have a dunkin' donuts indoors, and if I weren't in a state of need so profound that even a sock-tasting glazed donut would do, I never would have found out that they sell my favorite drink, the elixir of the gods, the sweet nectar of venus.  Cobblestone:-10 stars, plus 12 stars for serving Xenergy drinks=2 stars.  But if you don't care about the drinks I implore you: drive right on by.

What an embarrassment this place is. I decided to get the car washed and the oil changed. So I went here and the guy at the oil change are was buttering me up like I was the donald. He even said to me, "you work out, don't you." Um, you're scaring me. And I wouldn't buy whatever it is you're about to sell me at gunpoint.   But I really want to tell you that (predictably) the "wifi for your convenience" sign refers to a setup that will only work so long as "there's not a cloud in the sky" (direct quote). Veeerrrrrry convenient, cobblestone.  I kind of wish that if it is too much effort to fix the wifi, you'd at least work up the energy to take a chisel and scratch off the "wifi for your convenience" sign on the window.  I got in my car after the wash and the floormats were soaked.  "Oh, that's just our air freshener.  It's alcohol based, it will dry in a few days."  Don't you think you maybe put too much? "Well if we don't put that much it disappears as soon as you drive away." Well for god's sake don't invest in a product that has a fleck of quality!  I always say I'd rather light myself on fire than return here--yet, inexplicably I still do. Time and time again. Which only serves to add to the festering pit of rage that is swelling ominously in my soul.  Anyway--if you can avoid this place, do.

I am amending my star count.  If you read my previous reviews of this place then this will come as a surprise to you.  But let me relate my most recent experience:  I was going to Cobblestone with The One (my son, the second coming) and decided that I was going to buy two gallons of water, two liters of aquafina, and one xenergy drink (to which I am still hopelessly addicted).  Seeing as how I am not a mother and don't have the ridiculous power they have (where they can carry a baby and six other things, the combined weight of which is three times their body weight).  No, I am a father, which means that I am mortal.  So the manager (I think) walked by and saw that I was balancing The One (in his carseat) on one arm, very precariously, while trying to prop the door to the cooler open so that I could get all these drinks.  Well he stopped what he was doing and helped me out with the two gallons and then had an employee help me out to the car.  That is customer service, and it has long been my policy that all manner of sins can be overcome by good customer service.  There are still a number of ills with this place, and most of those ills have a birth certificate, but they are improving in my eyes and have won back three stars.

Here's an example of how much I love Houston's: I could actually tell the difference between head chefs (I remember very well the day I learned that Alex Van Uum switched to the ugly sister at 24th and Camelback).  I have someone who can vouch for me on this.  Head chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.  Appetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.  Sides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.  Wait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.  Bottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's.

First off, let me just say that this is my first yelp.  Go easy on me.  Visualize yourself shitfaced at the end of the night, stopping for a bucket of KFC because nothing could ever taste better than food when you're that drunk.  You with me?  LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.  Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.  Alternatives: mac and cheese  The waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling.

Well... The food here is good.  I like the chicken quesadilla for sure.  But the real reason to go to this place is the cookies!  The best cookie ever made is sold here : an oatmeal butterscotch chip masterpiece.  Also--an white chocolate chip pecan craisin cookie.  a legendary gingersnap--and I hate gingersnaps.  lemon bars!  five layer brownies!  chocolate creme cookies!  pumpkin bars which my god are ridiculously good.  it's very mesa-y and homey (not like hardcore homey, come on now) and the decor is countryish.  but if you want good cookies/desserts and decent food, go there.  one more thing--they have this frosted sugar cookie which everyone claims is the best thing in the whole place.  lofty assertion, indeed.  you should make your own decision...

I know it seems preposterous to have reviews for convenience stores, but let me tell you a little something about me: I have opinions about pretty much everything.  And if you have seen my opinion of the Cobblestone market across the street from my house, you will know that there are plenty of ways to screw up a corner store.  Enter quik trip, which forgoes every one of these ways with aplomb.  Where Cobblestone has gas pumps that are perpetually unwell in ways too numerous to recount, QT has gas pumps aplenty, and they all--get this--pump gas.  But the real charm of quik trip is how they purport to be a common man's convenience store but in reality have completely adept staff ringing people up like there's no tomorrow!  It's unreal.  Unlike the aforementioned dump across the street, in which you can expect to find a line even at 9:00 at night, at QT even in peak times the cashiers are ringing people up two at a time, one on either side of the register.  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful because there's--and I mean this--no job that is too menial to do well.  If you work at a convenience store, damn it, have some pride in your work.  I would.  And just because of these people, I would  gladly work at QT.  (Hell, in this market, I'll take any old job.  But you get the point.)  Bravo, QT.  And also you get a big fat wet kiss from me for being the first store to carry Xenergy drinks (Blu Pom Represent!!) in all of your locations.  Woot!

A Hangar Cafe Haiku:  Butter Colored Grease Magical, Viscous Pond On Plate, In Body  The Japanese really had something going with these haiku.  If it isn't worth saying in 17 syllables, is it really worth saying at all?  True, this is contrary to every facet of my conversational style, but...  I look for only two things in a breakfast place.  Eggs and hash browns.  If there are eggs and hash browns at a restaurant, it is a-ok.  But if you go to Hangar and sit at the bar, you will see them slathering a paintbrush into a golden vat and then smearing what comes out onto english muffins, into recipes, on to the griddle, and so on.  And that warms my heart in a way that would make every nutritionist cringe.  The bacon is cooked to that sublime level of disintegration where it just melts in your mouth.  Pancakes--decent.  French toast?  Actually quite palatable.  But the chicken fried steak? Now we're talking!  A dish that comes with all four of the food groups (i.e. butter, fat, grease, lard) making a succulent primordial soup on your plate.  Bursting with flavorful morsels of sausage and beef.  The perfect hangover cure, and by that I mean that if you're hungover, go stuff yourself with this meal and you'll want to die, but at least not because of the alcohol you drank.  Everyone wins, kinda.  Note: at 11, they no longer serve breakfast and who wants lunch after what I just explained to you?  Although I did have a croissant club sandwich and it was very respectable!  Just not, you know, chicken fried steak.  There sometimes is a wait.  Deal.  Because if you're looking for a greasy spoon, you just found it.

You know the arrogant asshole that no one wants to like--because he's an arrogant asshole--but everyone begrudgingly does like--because he's just so damn good?  (resist the temptation to say I'm that arrogant asshole)  Well, the Original Pancake House is just that arrogant asshole.  What you'll notice when you first arrive is (usually) a long wait and a bunch of rules.  Cash only.  We'll only seat full parties (or even put their names in line).  Substitutions at a la carte prices.  Sharing requires an additional fee.  Only short stacks of 49er flapjacks on the weekends.  Etc.  Etc.  So the first time you go there, you'll probably think, "this place may be good, but it won't be *that* good."  Well you'd be wrong.  I was.  The food here is bar none the best basic breakfast food you'll ever eat.  It's just perfect.  The strawberry pancakes come with this amazing strawberry syrup that is good enough to eat by itself with dabs of the homemade whipped cream (I know from experience).  The patty sausage is a pure euphony of spices.  My heart skips two beats every time I eat there.  Recommendations: the French crepes.  If you like strawberries and/or anything delicious, have the crepes.  The only, and I mean only problem with them is that they don't come with anything salty so if you want a variety then have a bite of someone else's shit because you absolutely must have these things.  49er flapjacks--thin, chewy, mindbendingly good.  Pecan pancakes.  They also offer many different types of crepes, oven baked omelettes, chocolate chip pancakes, coconut pancakes, blueberry, bacon pancakes, and on and on.  And, if it looks good to you, their specialty is this gigantic apple pancake--but imho it isn't the best thing on the menu.  Same with the Dutch baby.  Look: I know food.  Really.  If you don't like this place, then you are just a hater.  Sometimes you have to look past the rude hostess, the long wait times, and the excessive rules and just enjoy the best breakfast that the city has to offer.  And at least now they have a goddamn ATM in the store.

Any of you who read this who have ever been in love will be able to relate:  There's a first pang of distress, when the knife blade pierces the skin, when you know you are in for some pain.  But the endorphins kick in and you realize that you are in for more than you ever bargained for...  At los betos, after a few (5, 10, 20?) drinks, I had the sad misfortune of ordering a carnitas burrito at 220 in the am.  And what did I receive, but the most delectable delight ever served in the pinche madrugada ( rejoice, all my spanish speaking compañeros, a cuss word or two to titillate you).  The carnitas were cooked to a perfect crispy exterior, while the innards burst forth with a cornucopia of spices and flavors that made my very synapses fire indiscriminately with glee.  But, not to be outdone, heartburn would make its own dastardly play for my overwhelmed nerve endings, tearing me from neck to knave with pain.  Did I stop, even for one excruciating second?  Yes, but only long enough to pour on more green sauce, villainously spicy in a way that no beto, be it fili, rol, or eri, has ever been.  Nay, I succumbed to the sweet agony of picante and used that to goad me forth into the foxhole against the onslaught of acid reflux.  Each bite brought both more pain, acute, dire, and relentless, but also a sweet symphony of flavors that can only mean guacamole and green sauce replete with all the accoutrements.  I fought, and fought back hard, and what I can tell you is this:  No burrito has ever caused me such pain and yet no burrito has ever granted me such pleasure.  Like a sine curve, plunging predictably from zenith to nadir and back again, los betos has given me the pleasure--nay, the honor, of feeling every physical sensation known to sentient vertebrates.  Five glorious, painful, resonating stars.  Five harrowing yet riveting stars.  Five supernovas, five black holes, five big bangs of taste.  The world has never known anything like what I have just experienced.  You too can have what I had... all it takes is intestinal fortitude enough to jump in the car with a beer bong and head straight to thomas and hayden.  Oh, and leave the zantac at home, puss.

Bathroom that makes you want to crap into a hole in the floor?  Check. Jukebox that has a cornucopia of blissfully crappy hairband rock? Check. Beer?  Check. Dirt parking lot? Check. All in the heart of Scottsdale?  Check.  Yes, the coach house was brought to my consciousness by none other than Kathryn L., who isn't a yelper but should be, and her two lovely friends.  Dive bar perfection.  Not much space, too many smokers outside, but domestic light beer by the plenty and drunk pinball whenever you're ready to kick it up a notch.  This is also a great place for spring training drinks, and if you stay here long enough you just may forget your middle name.

The grapevine, bitch.  Invariably, if I'm bombed in scottsdale or anywhere close, an overwhelming urge hits me to get over to the 'vine and hit up some karaoke, blasted into a microphone with an angry face but a heart full of love.  Being the married chap that I am, I won't often be there, but if you see someone singing I'll Be There For You or Piano Man, know that it isn't all it could be unless Richard Z. is singing it, and throwing in his customary dash of Love (the secret ingredient).  They have food? Sure, whatever.  By the time I get to the 'vine I am too sloshed to care about food and way too sloshed to stop drinking.  And any post-grapevine morning where I can wake up and remember all the songs that I sang is a failure in my book.

DDS holds a special place in my heart.  It is the first place I remember getting kicked out of voluntarily.  By that, I mean that I left willingly, but when I had to get back in to use the atm they refused to permit me.  Why?  I don't know, because it's a miracle that I even remember that.  Who knows what else happened that night, but it can't be good, and now I strenuously refuse to go there ever again.  What's that, you ask?  The service?  The food/drink quality?  I don't know about any of this because I was too busy looking through a darkened kaleidoscope of debauchery that included women dancing on the bar and having their bras cut off by the bartenders.  If I had to guess, I would say I probably was just standing there in a stupor with a 15 degree leftward lean going on, the kind of lean that my friends know can only mean one thing: I need to stop drinking.

They have a waitress here named Sheena who is totally delightful in every way.  The location is good and I had a couple of appetizer pizzas which were distinctive and tasty.  Not the best pizza I've ever had but very good indeed.  All I heard was that the food was amazing from everyone who has eaten there but I was not in the eating mood and so I don't have much more to offer you in the way of reviews.  But there's always sheena!

I've created a new award: the "Wanted" award for worst of any given thing.  You know, the movie with Angelina where you could fling your wrist while shooting a gun and the bullet would somehow curve in midair?  You remember!  The movie with (once) respectable actors taking information from a giant loom that "WOVE" the "FABRIC" of time?  Get it?!?!?!?  Well the first Wanted award is in the Restaurants category.  Applause for Top Shelf, the absolute worst restaurant I've ever eaten at.  On the menu, you can choose from nachos that taste like cardboard, tacos stuffed with filling straight from the paper shredder, burritos made out of something a bum would live in, and enchiladas that fill your mouth with the familiar flavor of kleenex.  I hate to be mean.  But since I have a duty to anyone who reads this to disseminate truths, I have to just tell you that you should never go there.  If anyone wants to bring you there you should go all gandhi on them and start a hunger strike.  *trust me*

Crown.  Anchor.  Either one by itself would be sufficient for excellent dining.  But you put them both together and you get:  1. Bartenders/waitresses with kilts and knee highs.  Damn. 2. The scotch egg (!) which is a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage.  Shit yeah. 3. English soccer, and, better yet, english soccer fans at 430 in the morning on saturday singing and chanting to their teams.  The food is pretty decent but I have to tell you that there's more, like the huge beer selection and did I mention hot waitresses with kilts and knee highs?  Go there when a live soccer game is playing and there will be a crowd and a cover, even at 3 or 4 in the morning.  I shit you not.

Home of the $30,000 millionare.  I have a real issue with people who knock a restaurant because it's crowded.  As soon as I read a Yelp on the MVD, I'll look for crowd size as a criterion.  Until then, tell me about the food.  And the food at Sapporo is sublime.  I have had teppan yaki at probably ten restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is, by far, the best.  There are a lot of really attractive women there, too, so that doesn't hurt.  But that is mitigated by the high douchebag quotient--any happy hour will see the bar full of more tools than your local Ace.  But if you want teppan yaki, this is the place to go.  Also, they have the best fried rice I've ever had (if you don't count those dive Chinese restaurants that are one health inspector away from shutting their doors, that is.  Sanitary?  No.  But def tasty.)  I have been there dozens of times but the teppan is so good that I've never eaten the pacific rim sit down dinners or whatever else they offer.  If you do go there, I would say the filet is good enough to make the Kobe beef a waste of money.  And I would highly recommend the calamari steak as part of your dinner.  It is top notch.  The moral of the story is that even though it takes a miracle to find a parking spot, and even though your IQ drops ten points just by being around the clientele at happy hour, it's still more than worth it to eat at this place.

The most delicious soup I've ever eaten, period.  Tommy Bahama Crab Bisque.  Imagine a stick of butter with crab flavor and a delightful crostini--there it is, the Tommy Bahama Crab Bisque.  So rich, so buttery, so wonderful.  If you like how it sound so far, go get it.  Sometimes you order iced tea at a place and it's all cloudy and gross?  not here.  The iced tea is brewed to such perfection that you can actually see through the glass.  They have a steak salad that is really good and their food is tasty, all around.  But I will tell you that for what it is, it's pricy as hell and to be totally honest the food quality is not commensurate with the price tag.  But it is still worth going, at least once, because it is a great location and they have the best soup known to man.

If you see someone who reviewed Burger Bar and they didn't give it five stars, then their reviews should not carry any weight at all with you ever again.  Period.  For sure.  Picture a lonely ciabatta bun (the bottom half).  As if there were indeed a god, this bun gets married to a juicy, savory, delicious, mouthwatering patty of ground beef grilled to absolute divinity.  Who are the bridesmaids, you ask?  Tomato.  Avocado.  Lettuce.  Groomsmen?  Ketchup.  Mayo.  American cheese.  Who is the best man?  a fried egg, just waiting to burst forth with delightfulness that will dribble everywhere.  And the maid of honor?  Who so often is (admit it) the main attraction?  A red wine shallot reduction, poured on top of all of this goodness before the rest of the ciabatta comes to cap off the whole fandango.  Nay, I tell you, if you can eat that burger and not give burger bar five stars then you have a blackened soul.  Fine, you need more?  The regular patties are perfect enough to forgo the more expensive fare like buffalo or kobe but I have tried the kobe.  Get a peanut butter shake because daaaaaaaaaaaaamn!  Also they serve sweet potato fries, so who wouldn't like that?  But get the burger.  Get it the way I told you.  Throw some salt and pepper on there (ring bearer, flower girl) and you will be in absolute bliss.  Or you're a fool.

Or Blackout Centrale, as I like to refer to it.  This place is notorious in my book for the fact that every time I've ever gone, I have lost patches of time in the ol' memory bank.  I blame the 2 for 1 drink specials that they always seem to have going on.  Have you ever heard the "I'm a big douche at the scottsdale bars" on youtube?  Well Devil's is definitely full of big douches and the scene is very scottsdaley.  But I never have a complaint because, let's face it, I usually can't enunciate very well when I'm there.  Anytime the weather isn't *too* bad they have nice outdoor seating and the layout of the place makes it possible to get away from dancing tools.  But if you go, figure out a way to get home other than driving yourself.

FYI:  I am not reviewing the coffee, the price tag, or anything else on this review.  I consider them all worthy of being considered as criteria on the five star scale, but some food items are so tasty as to render all flaws meaningless.  Enter the peanut butter crepe.  Ordinarily when I go to Le Creperie I order the nutella crepe.  Chocolate hazelnut goo inside a thin, chewy, magical crepe and buried under a mountain of whipped cream.  But this day I saw on the menu a different crepe.  My wandering eyes betrayed the nutella and settled on "banana" and "peanut butter" and saw no alternative.  Thank you, wandering eyes.  If you could distill Beethoven's fifth symphony into a dessert, this crepe is what you'd get.  Ripe bananas bursting with sugar.  Peanutty, not-sweet peanut butter for contrast, and then a pound of whipped cream and carmel sauce all accompanied by a crepe make for one of the best desserts I've ever had.  Yes, you need to take your keys to your car, put them in the ignition, and drive straight to LV to get this crepe.

Here's the deal about lee's.  The sandwiches are indeed good.  Not all of them, mind you, because I don't think I'll ever recommend a sardine sandwich to anyone, ever.  But this is a place where you know that you're gonna get a cheap and very tasty lunch.  The croissants are delish and even the baguettes are great.  Also they have a frozen coffee drink that I hear is top notch.  Bring cash, that's all they take.  Look, it may not be ritzy *dallas g.* but you're no aristocrat either.  So don't look down your nose at Lee's--this fat person is rarely wrong, and never about food.

Because someone yelled at me for doling out stars like candy, I now feel guilty when I give out five stars for a restaurant I've only visited once.  Do they deserve the fifth star?  Was it an aberration? Will I look douchey to someone else who, based on more visits, has deemed this place mediocre?  But if you had the grilled spek sandwich (proscuitto, tomatoes, cheese) that I just had on the sublimely amazing bread they have at cibo, you would indeed feel it obligatory to give them all five stars.  The fruit that is served w/ the meal was whatever but I don't care, because it has been a long time since I had a sandwich that good.

Oh my f*ing phenomenal.  Yesterday I went to fez and sat on the patio.  Thank god it wasn't vegetarian day because I had the spiritual enlightenment on ciabatta that is otherwise listed as the Douxelle burger.  That's right, I got that burger even though I hate mushrooms--on the strength of Brad E's recommendation.  Burger topped with tomato, sauteed mushrooms and onions, and dijon, and sweet potato fries on the side?  You can bet stacks of benjies that I will be there to donkey punch that fucker again, and soon.  I was told the veggie burger is amazing and maybe I'll try it one day but for now you'll have to trust me that there is now a burger out there that rivals the Houston's cheeseburger for most succulent thing in the universe.  the friend I was with got some roughage with dressing on the side.  sheesh.

I'll qualify this review up front: all I ever ask for in a breakfast is a pile of extra crispy hash browns and two to three eggs, over easy.  I put the eggs on top, dump some salt, pepper, and tabasco on there, and mix it all up.  If you learn nothing else from me, learn this: that is the way to start the day.  Having said that, damn does Matt's have some good hashbrowns and eggs.  But I give it extra credit for having delicious looking pancakes, which I've never eaten, and some really damn good honey lemonade.  I had pork chops and eggs there, and I've had the T-bone and eggs there, but the meats are really just a distraction from what I love so much.

Really if I weren't in a good mood because it's fathers day, I would pound this sucker into one star submission.  Why?  Because I've only ever eaten here when I've been comprehensively smashed, and the food wasn't that great, even then.  I end up eating it and thinking, that was okay. Okay?!?!  When I'm that drunk, pretty much anything I ever eat tastes like the sweet nectar of the gods, dribbled down jessica biel's naked body into my gaping, expectant maw.  But this stuff just tasted bland, even with cheese whiz all over it (!) and made me feel uncomfortably full.  don't even ask how i felt the next morning (aside: I won't penalize this place for that feeling of remorse because it *could* be that I felt remorse for waking up in a gutter covered with lipstick that was conspicuously similar to that one male stripper's... nevermind) but let's just say--acid reflux.  anyway, the food is mediocre when you're smashed so please don't go there sober expecting anything but empty calories.  If you must go, get the fried mac and cheese--that is indeed tasty.

This place is supposedly owned by the same people that own Sapporo. Or maybe it was and isn't now, I don't know. What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote:   Three friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes.   Well of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER?   So the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. "The one colored like salmon?" Yes. "And the tuna colored one?" Salmon. Ah. "Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way.   Now I'm making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren't, I'd watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy "salmon" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all.   Moral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you're about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)

Okay Pro: the atmosphere on any spring sunday on the patio makes it worth five stars all by itself. Con: can't I get a well drink special on said sundays? Pro: half off all bottles of wine though!  even my favorite, sonoma cutrer. Con: the manager (who was named after a cooking spray, no more info than that for you) doesn't appreciate drunk stupidity.  I know this, because she doesn't appreciate me when I'm drunk and stupid--according to sources--and i am the very epitome of drunk stupidity.  Now, wouldn't you, if you were a bar manager, realize that the very life blood of your business is drunk ppl making bad decisions?  Come ON people?  Sorry about the aside.  Pro: the quesadilla they have is goddamn good--it even has shrooms in it which I ordinarily avoid.  But solid food, drink, and atmosphere give this place 5 stars for me.  With a 1 star deduction:)

Crap.  Crap crap.  Crap.  Is that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.  Then they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.  Or, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.  I hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one.

Bottles everywhere are brimming over with lightning. Blind squirrels near and far are dining on lavish feasts of nuts.   Dallas G. picked a lunch spot and it was amazing. I've been to the cornish pasty co before but not for a couple of years, and this time it was sublime. They have this pasty (essentially a mini calzone lookin' dealy with different innards) called the royale with cheese. Filled with burger, onions, fries, and such and served with 1000 island or whatever other goo you should like. Sublime.   It seems small but is filling, and our waitress is a lovable little thing, too. Hells yeah.   If I were a little more stuck up I might deduct one star for the ramshackle looking fellow in the chiefs hat who is running around doing various tasks--this is a food place, after all--but I'm not. 5 stars.

So a co-worker took us to this place.  I barely know this co-worker, which is to say that I have no idea if she's a culinary idiot or if she's worth listening to.  I have issues leaving my comfort zone.  Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.  But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.  I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.  The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.  Anyway.  I have yet to try anything else but what I had was delish.  And unlike my suspect co-worker, you can trust me.

Another on the list of items that you simply must have before you die:  the tomato gin soup at WCG.  I will agree that the place has its misses on the menu, but overall it is a very solid place with at least one completely exceptional soup.  They have a filet cobb salad with a red wine vinaigrette which is really good and I always love the baked broccoli or the honey-gooped carrots (not their real name).  Finally, their sandwiches are really tasty.  The story goes that some people split off from Houston's and went off to start WCG.  You'll see that right away.  But whereas Houston's is a five star delight, WCG merits only four.  But trust me when I tell you to get the tomato gin soup.  Today.

Do we begrudge Pei Wei for being what it is?  The question of how many stars to give pei wei is a question of one's very theory of awarding stars.  is a fast-asian kitchen even worthy of five stars at its best?  could it ever live up to a mastros, or a houstons, or another restaurant of such ilk?  my perspective is that you must grade it for what it is, not what it never attempts to be.  And what it is is a great place to go to get a quick bite of very tasty asian food.  I have had many of their offerings and have rarely been disappointed.  spicy korean: delicious, with brown rice and extra veggies you might even consider it healthy.  mongolian beef, sweet, yet savory in that way that only mongolian beef can be.  and their kung pao chicken is spicy and flavorful.  is it groundbreaking?  no.  but I can go order it online and pick it up 9 minutes later and that is something that is worthy of mention.  also worthy of mention is some really delicious crab wontons and a very delightful rendition of sweet and sour sauce.  Probably the best crab wontons in the whole world--or at least this side of the prime meridian.  of course chinese ppl probably have no clue how to make *real* chinese food.  look, I am not saying that the pei wei's executive chef is gonna win any battles of kitchen stadium, but if you go to pei wei for that sort of thing then it's on you, knucklehead.  Quick, not too expensive, and very tasty.

OMG four and a half stars?  Apparently if you want a four and a half star performance from a sandwich, you can go to dilly's deli.  Alternatively, you can:  Go to the store.  Buy a loaf of bread.  Make your sandwich with four slices of bread, instead of two.  Put mediocre meat on it.  Serve it with a side of potato salad that has too much dill in it and will stay on your breath for a month.  Don't drink the water here because it tastes like sewage.  I could be in the minority here but the witches were in the minority during the salem witch trials and upon further review, who was right?  I rest my case.

There was a time when I'd look down my nose at Bookmans, and I'll tell you why.  I am a typical guy (read:slob) and yet I have some ridiculous idiosyncracies.  Like books.  I love new books.  When I read them I barely open them so that the spine doesn't get all cracked.  I don't write in the book.  I actually use a bookmark.  But since indigence has shunted me down a few rungs on the socioeconomic ladder to the caste of the untouchables, I find myself open to new things.  By new things, I mean old things.  Like ratty books.  So my wife and I have a ridiculous amount of books at home, because I want you to come into my home and think I'm smart.  Plus, we were both humanities majors, so we have a really strange assortment of books about totalitarianism, eastern european feminist writings, italian-immigration stories, you name it.  So we brought in six grocery bags of books.  Here's what we learned. -don't look for cash.  they'll offer it to you but it's roughly 15% or less of what they'll offer in trade. -they pretty much don't take hardbacks. -they look for weird books, which surprised me.  super-popular books are usually overstocked there. -they want plays -they want books they've never heard of -if you let one person look through your books, sometimes another buyer there will buy a few of the other buyer's rejects. -the books that are there for purchase have little prices written in pencil on the first page.  And while the prospect of in-store credit may make you cringe, they have a ton of possibilities.  dvds, cds, even records!  and lots of books.  old magazines.  you can definitely spend money there.  it is, admittedly, a bit ghetto.  but we're in a recession, right?  and on your dying bed, will you really care if the book you bought had already been read?

Look.  If you like only Chicago style pizza, don't go here.  Also, you're a moron.  Also, the Cubs will never win the world series and the Bears eat a dick.  For the rest of us, this pizza is absolutely sublime.  Things that set it apart: the coal brick-oven makes the crust perfectly crispy on the outside and bready on the inside.  The crust is hand-tossed, not too thin but certainly not too thick.  The sauce actually looks like it's made from real tomatoes, not tomato paste.  The mozzarella cheese is actually real mozzarella cheese, not part-skim junk.  The pepperonis are small and crispy around the edges.  This is what it's all about.  They have a magnificent pesto pizza and decent salads.  The cannoli is brilliant.  But what I suggest, humbly, to you is to take a friend or two to your nearest Grimaldi's and enjoy the best (except Pizzeria Bianco, which isn't a fair comparison) pizza you can buy in the city.  Plus, they have a more-than-respectable bar.  One other thing: you New Yorkers can kiss my ass too, because I know you think your city's the shit also.  Well it isn't.

Some things are so tasty that when you go to a restaurant, you simply must get them, no matter what.  The onion rings at Zipps with the sweet jalapeno goo fall into that category.  If you go to Zipps, you can get really good burgers, foccacias (really they're wraps) and some damn good french fries.  They serve beer for cheap and have a bunch of TVs.  This particular location has a savvy young waiter named Danny who kept us happy in terms of drinks, shots, etc.  Well done, sir.  The greek salad is mediocre, I would pass, especially since you don't go there for the salads.  You go there for the... say it with me...  onion rings with sweet jalapeno goo!  trust me.

How do you spell average?  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r  how do you spell mediocre?  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r  how do you spell blah?  (hint: starts with an E)  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r!  if you ever ask someone if they can recommend a movie, and they tell you go see independence day! then that is the sort of person you send to elephant bar.  blaaaaaaaaaah.  it is in the ranks of firebird's and so on.  i can't claim that the food is bad because it's so resoundingly mediocre.  if you are looking for a boring way to sustain life for just long enough to have a boring night with boring people in a boring place and on a boring day of the week, at a boring time of day, and with boring food and boring drink, boring menus and boring specials, boring beers and boring desserts, all while being mind-numbingly bored, then I say to you:  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r

I can't tell you for sure.  It may be that this place isn't that great.  But since I basically just *completed* over a cupcake I think that five stars is the least i could do.  I'm gonna tell you a secret--if you follow @sprinkles on twitter they sometimes have secret codes you can whisper to them to get a free cupcake.  Today it was a free red velvet for the first 25 ppl that came in and whispered "3."  So in order to prevent myself from going there every morning when they open and getting a free cupcake, I will tell you all the little secret.  (It only works if you are also following @spirit_fingers)  Today an enchanting girl (the most enchanting of the five enchanting girls there) told me that I would be a fool to not get the pumpkin cupcake with cinnamon cream cheese icing.  I love pumpkin more than pretty much anything but goddamn is their red velvet cupcake (cream cheese icing) good.  So i didn't know which to get (at this point didn't realize the red velvet was a door prize) and finally settled on the pumpkin (mainly because of her brown eyes).  (not really.  food before hoes, or whatever the saying is)  as I unwrapped the pumpkin cupcake, I felt the surge of anticipation familiar to teenagers everywhere.  every scent struck me where it counts.  every soft, moist hunk of delightfulness made me weak.  I'm mixing my metaphors and it's confusing me.  The pumpkin, anyway, was ridiculous.  So fucking good.  You owe it to the fat person in you to go there and get some cupcakes, stat.

I'm getting a little pissed off here.  I'll tell you why: because Sprinkles is a really good cupcake place, and there are so many crappy reviews.  I have divided them into two categories: 1) bad experiences.  I will never begrudge someone who gets a just plain crappy X to bash the restaurant that sells Xs.  Because consistency is key and that's important.  I do, as a general rule, believe in second chances, though.  Karma, people. 2)you're stuck up, and because someone said Sprinkles was amazing you're looking to be whisked off to some happy place with bikini-clad waitresses serving pitchers of beer and little people riding around on toy horses.  So because you're joyless, you bash sprinkles, as if it's their fault you're incapable of enjoying yourself.  Well it isn't.  I am a food snob and I am going to tell you that it isn't the best food I've ever had in the whole world ever, but shit.  is that what it takes to give a place above three stars?  no.  I have now had the red velvet, banana with vanilla frosting, pumpkin, peanut butter chip, and key lime cupcakes, and they were all sublime (except key lime which I don't like in the first place but hey! it was free. what can I say).  So I think it's fair to say that the place is pretty f*ing good and I can promise you that if you don't like it, you are culpable in some way.  So fix whatever is wrong with you and go to Sprinkles, then give it the 4*-5 stars it deserves.    *Some people have this theory that there is "no such thing" as perfection in the real world, so they never give out 5/5 stars.  You will notice middle managers who subscribe to this theory, because, as a general rule, they're miserable motherfuckers.  Well that's a stupid reason to not give something a perfect score, just fyi, and if you are one of those people I suggest you get a clue and adjust your paradigm.  But if you insist on living your life that way then you may indeed give Sprinkles four stars.

we're talking ridiculously delightful, here.  we're talking about an adorableness that is surpassed only by the hugely adorable morning barista, Sam, who put up with the idiosyncracies of my extended family with ease.  this place is so f$%#ing cute I can't stand it.  It has a smallish inside with free wireless, a coffee bar, and a small but well-appointed menu that is just full of delicious stuff.  There's a huge outside patio which has some good tree-shade so that it's palatable even when it's a bit too hot to sit outside under other circumstances.  We had some of everything when we went.  The panini are served with this thick (in size--it wasn't very dense at all) bread that is buttery and flaky and golden all at once, and really good ingredients.  My mom got the melon and prosciutto panini.  I got the veggie panini (tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes, etc) which was really great--my personal preference would be fewer red peppers but I just plucked them off.  There's a chimichurri panini.  All really good.  There's a panini (I'm guessing the singular of panini is panino but how pretentious should I get in this forum?) with mozzarella and tomato and basil.  Yesterday was vegetarian day, and there were plenty of options for that.  They also offer bruschetta, where you choose from a bunch of different options--mostly the same as would be available on the panini, so a lot of the above possibilities--and that received rave reviews as well.  The wine was half off.  The cappuccinos were tasty (I hear).  Sam was charming.  What more can I say?  Ah--one more thing.  They had a flourless chocolate dessert from Tammie Coe, which was my first experience with a Tammie Coe item, and it was reeeeeally good.  It was called the Chocolate Sensational and it had a few berries around the rich chocolate thing.  I would add more berries if I were god.  But I'm not, I keep getting told.  One final note.  There are a couple reviews that bash the place for slow-ish service.  I would just remind everyone that this isn't ihop--this place has a south american (and in my opinion, european) feel and if I can tell you anything about service in south america, it's don't be in a hurry.  I know, you rebut: we live here. in north america.  But that isn't the point.  The point is this: you go to this place to get a taste of what such a restaurant would be in south america.  it's clean, it's cute, it's small. the food is excellent, and surprisingly well priced.  It's like your own little foreign exchange coup!    Moral: Bomberos is the mad note.  Go there and relax.  You're too uptight, anyway.

I am being forced to yelp on whole foods by my wife.  she says:  -I love everything about it. -It has a good energy. -It has good baked goods. -It has good coffee. -I feel like I'm doing something good for the environment when I eat at their organic salad bar.  Now, for my yelp.  They have this chocolate chip scone purportedly grown by someone local, and they always run out of it by like 11 am.  The reason: because it's goddamn phenomenal.  Flaky, delicious, with golf-ball sized chocolate chips.  It is really top notch.  I also had a cheese danish there and it was exceptional, too.  It made me have second thoughts about buying the scone, once.  It is a good place to go for lunch because they have a jillion different stations like tapas, pizza, carvery, asian food, etc. and they let you taste anything.  But I do have to say that the food is not always delicious enough.  I attribute this to any of the many reasons my wife likes the place--all boiled down to the fact that there probably isn't much butter or grease in the food.  And the pricing--well, they're pretty proud of the stuff they serve.  But overall, i like the ethos of whole foods (even though they are probably a giant company ripping off the little guy in some way) and I give it a solid four stars.

Okay before I get into the drinks, I'll start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.    Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.    Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less.   For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  It's good, you'll be flavored, life is perfect.

I heard that temple bar served tater tots smothered in cheese and bacon.  For this I thought it would be worth it to go to temple.    Well the first time I went there the bartender told me he had sent home the cook.  At the *restaurant* he had sent home the *cook.*  restaurant but no cook?    So we had drinks and I got a vodka cran so red that there's a crayola in the works that will have the words "temple bar vodka cran red" emblazoned on its wrapper.    One week later, we show up again to tb (appropriately the same acronym as an infectious disease) and are told that they just changed the schedule and no food is available!  Foiled again!    Well fortunately I had gotten in my order before the bad news came and I had the smothered tots. I was underwhelmed--not enough cheese, bacon that was too sweet... ftr the saying is *under*promise and *over*deliver, not the goddamn reverse, ppl.   And the waitress was very confused as to how to handle a large group, with the check and what not.  Well maybe she should worry about how she'd pay her bills without customers?  Food for thought.    Save your trip.  Go to zipps or wherever, doesn't matter to me.

Apparently there is a burly sasquatch with a gun in the back that forces the owner to stay open past 2am on saturdays, even though the hours are only til 2.  I know this because I was there and that was one cranky owner.  If you would like miserable crankiness and horrifyingly bad service, I invite you to go to this place anytime and chat up the charming owner. To their credit, the employees are not the owner. If they were, I would want to punch them too.   Pizza: decent. Actually pretty good. Not good enough to weather the one-man storm of discontent. Don't go there.

I know that two stars seems harsh.  But meh.  I've experienced better.  Dallas G has a policy about giving bad reviews because people put their heart and soul into their food and all, but I really wish they'd put salt in their food instead.  I had shawarma beef and lamb on a baguette.  Anything with meat in a pile of grease on a nice baguette should be delicious, right?  No--it had very little flavor, if any at all.  If nothing is a flavor, it had lots of that.  The baguette, far from being crispy on the outside the way a baguette should be, was soft and undercooked seeming.  It fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Travesty.  Look--if you're cooking for others and you taste your food and it doesn't taste like anything, pick up the salt shaker and drop some salt in there.  It's a good start, if nothing else.  Completely underwhelming.  Dally loved his salad but I know for a fact that it couldn't have been good because it had arugula on it and arugula tastes like fart.  So two stars.  You won't die if you eat here but it's no way to live, either.

Okay, so you go to hooters.  What is it you're expecting?  a) good food b) compelling scenery c) all of the above  If you answered anything but (b), you are deluding yourself.  Hooters has some appallingly bad food.  I mean, it's atrocious.  I have never been to a place where so many menu items are downright offensive.  Burger? dry. tasteless.  Steak sandwich?  *goodyear tires*  tater tots? 2 stars, half of the stars come from the fact that they use movie theatre cheese, which is magnificent.  Fries?  Curly.  Like pubes.  Chicken wings? Breaded.  BREADED?  It's like they're going out of their way to make their food suck ass!  Yet I still bequeath them with four stars, and the reason is that I don't go there for the food.  In fact, I try to time my visits to correspond with non-meal times, as in: I eat, then I go there.  Because they have beer, and they have flirtatious staff.  They should be docked three stars for the support-stocking tights they wear, but that's not up to them.  So at the tempe location, I have to say that the ladies there have a healthy dose of charisma and charm, and this all in addition to the fact that they are cute.  They sing, they dance, they look at you lasciviously, even though they don't mean it... in short, it's everything you look for in a sports bar.  I didn't choose hooters today, because I never do, but I rate restaurants for a)what they attempt to be and b)what everyone should expect out of them and nothing more.  four stars, just not--and I repeat *not*--for the food.

I used to like blue wasabi.  Admittedly, I liked other sushi places better.  Blue wasabi was more of a drinking place with decent sushi, and I don't mean decent like not indecent--I mean decent like eh, it was decent.  this place has the acoustics of a mess hall.  annoying. but what really annoyed me was this:  one time I was there with wife and in-laws, and because I have a ridiculously sensitive palate (at least when it comes to salt) I noticed right away that there was some foul shit happening with the soy sauce.  By foul shit, I mean that they were serving the low sodium version.  *pauses for ensuing outrage*  Now they serve their soy sauce in little innocuous looking devices that don't come with the courtesy of a green or red lid.  What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.  Which is punishable by law, or divine retribution when "kingdom" finally "comes."  anyway....  So I ask for the manager, and say: "is this low sodium soy sauce?" And he says: "Yes."  And I say: "Can I please have some *real* soy sauce?" And he says: "we don't serve anything but low sodium soy sauce."  One fucking star, and be glad you got even that.  You should be embarrassed.

Just when you thought you were clinging precipitously to the bottom rung on the social ladder, you drop in to the men's shoe department at macy's because your shoe blew up in public and find that there is, indeed, someone (well) below you on life's cruel hierarchy.  enter "d" (I think, but you'll recognize him by the fact that he looks like): a native american clark griswold, except six notches more clueless-looking.  Poor guy.  About me: I really don't have much patience for dumb people, no offense.  So when someone has been dealt such a pitiful hand in the intellect category that I actually feel sorry for them despite their idiocy, that person truly has it rough.  Now my wife, on the other hand, she wanted to slit this guy's throat.  I only pity you all for not knowing her well enough to know just how comical and dire that is.  So my shoe blew up in a particularly embarrassing fashion as I was leaving work today.  We went to Macy's because I had a gift card.  Usually the department store men's shoe section is exactly the place you go when you're looking for a rancid smattering of riff-raff and retreads (no offense), and "d" fit the bill here with his black levi's and black t-shirt for a work uniform.  so there's a sale and i ask if they have this one shoe size in a 13 (yes, it's *huge*).  clark comes back and says no, they don't, but they do have it in an 8.5 or 9.5.  Great, I'll take a pair for my invisible midget friend here.  Meanwhile, some young michael jackson knockoff comes in and asks "d" if he can show him how to tie a tie.  not shitting you.  so i ask "d" if they have this other shoe and apparently they have it in a 12.  I ask: "do those shoes happen to run large at all?"  Him: "Um. They come in up to a size 13, we just don't have it."  Right.  I make a sufficiently pained expression and say that i will try on the size 12 just in case.  Before he gets to getting me the size 12 shoe, he starts tying the tie on this waifish, pubescent kid who can only be conflicted in all the most crucial ways, including how high on one's ass pants should be worn.  My wife seethes at this, because he just stopped helping us to work on this other guy.  She wants to leave and go to another Macy's.  I opt to just pick up my next potential purchase and bang the soles together, to her immense consternation.  So she goes on and walks around because she can't handle this guy's impudence.  I decide to walk over to where the blind is leading the blind and leer, just to get my point across.  It ultimately works.  I get my shoes.  That's most of the story.  Except that while I was paying, "d" asked if I was thinking of upgrading my wardrobe anytime soon.  Humility, to be sure.  (Wife: "I was kind of angry.  He just kind of left us there and started helping someone else, like we were nothing."  As you can see, she is worked up.)

This place was utter garbage. We had palak paneer - too greasy, not good. Paneer makhani or tikka masala, not sure which because the sauce was basically white with red flecks, and not good. We had a chana masala (presumably) dish and it was mushy and didn't taste like any I've ever had before. Honestly, if this were the first Indian food I had ever had I would never ever return. And the cashier shortchanged me. So... Eat here at your own bloody peril. **in fairness, this is the only Indian food I have ever had in Quebec. If this is always what it tastes like then my apologies to the entire staff of Pushap except for the person who stiffed me and also as a general note to all québécois, the world of Indian food has so, so much more to offer you.

Praise be to Amber W.   I was a thai food beginner, then she introduced yuphas. That was my whole world--then she told me about thai elephant. My belief after eating at yuphas was that fried rice could be executed no more skillfully than yupha her(him?)self did it. But thai elephant has kicked it up yet another notch.   I get the drunken fried rice, add egg, which includes typical fried rice but adds jalapeno and probably something else I'm forgetting. It delivers a savory and delectable punch that leaves me reeling with delight. By the time I get back to work, I feel a sensation that only the most brain-nullifying postcoital stupor could deliver.   Now I have had a crappy day but that feeling gnawing at my insides is a longing, a *desperation* for thai elephant and the thrills that that only drunken fried rice can impart. Drunken, indeed, for I am in love.

I hate that places are using "z" at the ends of words instead of "s."  Are you doing it to be clever?  Because everyone does it, so it isn't clever.  But clever is not in high supply at any of these newfangled yogurt places--what it really comes down to is whether or not the yogurt is tasty.  And it is!  They had more of a selection than Mojo, which I appreciate--they had chocolate/vanilla, strawberry, banana, a couple of non-dairy choices, and so on.  I got strawberry with... cheesecake bits.  And they were so creamy and delightful that each was a little foodgasm all its own.   Complaints: Um... where is the trust? The worker did not give us cups to taste--he insisted on serving the yogurt to us himself, even for tasters.  At Golden Spoon this makes sense because we cant reach the machines, but here it's self serve! You trust us to get a ton of yogurt but not a sample size?  He didn't really get what I was saying so he gave me a non-dairy toasted almond tester which I had to choke down to not be rude, but I hate non-dairy and I don't like almond so how do you think that made me feel?  He gave me another tester but it ran out onto his thumb, so I was grossed out.  Does he wash? Presumably, but...  Anyway I realize that's a nitpick *but* it does make for a weird experience.  And... there weren't enough cheesecake bits.  I want enough to fill a garbage can.  A large garbage can.  Anywayyyyyyyy... despite those minor issues I would definitely recommend this place-- yogurt is as good or better as mojo and yogurtland and the selection is definitely better than Mojo.

so check it out: they have these prepackaged meals in the back that you just pop in the microwave and BAM!, there's dinner. well I'm not one to sacrifice on taste so I was really thrilled with the chicken masala.  4 and a half minutes later I was eating some pretty tasty lunch, and it only cost 479 or whatever (if I were literate I would have read that if I purchased three there would have been a 20% discount).  Also tasted the bacon and cheese quiche, not microwaveable but really exceptional.  My good man dallas g. bought two types of hummus, both largely satisfactory and more!  (spicy jalapeno hummus and roasted red pepper hummus...)  But on the way home, we passed this guy in a late-model convertible mustang, top up, windows closed, wearing his fuck-me sunglasses and smoking a cigar?!?!  So I take away one star for that because any business situated this close to that type of douchebaggery needs to be smacked down, and smacked down hard.  I am quite certain that were we able to see the whole wardrobe there would be socks with tevas going on down below.  Or crocs.  same diff.  But I add one star back for the fact that you can pretty much get any bag of veggies and just pop them in the micro for a nice steamed side dish, or all their meats that look good, or the fact that capn crunch was the first thing I saw on the way in.  It's all good, after all.

This was a veritable who's who of the twitter/yelp scene.  i felt honored just to be there.  after breakfast at LGO we went to OTFM just because we could, and saw Nathan S (and Maura, with Buckley and Mabel), Andrew K, Julia T, Sam L., and Joel L. among others I'm sure. My wife and I brought our son, The One, and annoyed everyone with the stroller which in all likelihood would have been much more annoying if it were earlier in the day.  That would have been a small price to pay if we *could* have gotten there earlier because we could have had some of the legendary bread that everyone talks about.  as it was we were too late, and all we had to choose from was a block of rye and I think a sundried tomato loaf.    The burrito that Andrew was eating was sporting an amazing looking tortilla, buttery and wonderful. But... we weren't there to eat, we were there to buy stuff for dinner that was consistent with our new (depressing) quasi-vegan lifestyle.  And OTFM did not disappoint. Someone was running around with some sexy-lookin' purple cauliflower and so being the follower that I am, I had to have some. Although they were out one of the workers tracked me down and said that he had some more coming out, which I of course appreciated. They also had orange cauliflower which I wish I had gotten.  We ended up baking broccoli and purple cauliflower with some olive oil and salt and pepper and it was pretty delish.  We also got some really tasty tomatoes and oranges.  Fresh and flavorful.  This may sound dumb but I actually haven't tasted such a tomato-y tomato in years and it really added a lot to what we made.  (If you must know, some guacamole with blended onion and serrano pepper, plus tomato chunks.  Add in some garlic salt and a squeeze of lemon maybe and you won't know what to do with yourself.  Anyway we'll definitely be back--maybe even this saturday.  I'm sure we'll see many Yelpers there... can't wait.

I have been to four such places in the Phoenix area and if you combine food and ambience this is the best by a mile.  The service was exceptional--we didn't have to wait for anything and people were coming by constantly not only to serve us a gajillion types of meat, but to check on our every need.  Refills?  Sauces?  A particular cut you'd like?  Anything and everything was available right away.  We got taken on a tour of the kitchen and it is huge and spotless.  There is also a private room which apparently is first-come-first-served and is no additional charge.  There is a salad bar with chilled asparagus, hearts of palm, and the most ridiculous artichoke hearts--literally just the very best part of the artichoke here.  There was a delicious chicken salad, potato salad, a bunch of cheeses, and cold cuts.  But of course, the main event was the meat--sausage, sirloin, leg of lamb, chicken legs, bacon wrapped chicken breast, bacon wrapped filet... and the best cut of filet mignon that I've had in a long time.  Tender, amazing, delightful.  This place also gets extra kudos for the fact that the servers ask as they are cutting the meat which doneness you want, which is nice.  I really enjoyed it.  Finally--the dessert was sublime.  Between the three of us, we shared the papaya-ice cream-black currant liqueur thingy, which wasn't too sweet but wonderfully subtle; the molten chocolate cake which would be the most perfect desert known to humanity if it had a few more fresh berries on there, and a wonderful creme brulee which capped off my birthday in the best possible way.  Gabi was evasive when I asked if it was her who ratted me out and scored me a free birthday dessert but I will go ahead and give her the credit since she's just so all-around exceptional.  Once again, an exceptional event--thanks to Yelp and most importantly, thanks so much to Fogo de Chao.

I really expected crappy food, because, after all, that's what sports bars generally offer.  Then I was told that the food was not bad, but good!  Which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously.  I ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice.  these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso.  Now like I said, I expected crap.  But the tacos, with pico and queso poured on them, and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate, were really amazingly good.  The steak bits were really tender--ordinarily in such a taco they'd be the tenderness of jerky.  Really: the tacos were totally sensational.  Also, we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza.  And it was great!  even with the bleu cheese, which I detest, this was a culinary delight.  So why the four stars, you ask?  two reasons.  One: the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad, like straight out of a box of rice-a-roni bad.  I would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item.  And one other thing: it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer OUT OF PITCHERS THAT WERE IN THE REFRIGERATOR INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TAP!  Capital crime.  Felonious.  In fact, Dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap.  So you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and I'd never look back, I didn't drink beer tonight and so I really don't care if my table mates suffer.  But if you try that shit on me...  Four stars.  The food is really damn good.

This may be fiction.  I don't know for sure.  Here's what I pretty much think happened.  The other night I was at a bar.  two days later I heard that it was Turf.  So I'm gonna go with it.  In body I was there, however my mind was suffering under an oppressive weight called alcohol that blurred pretty much every little thing that happened.  For example: did I really find myself screaming piano man at the top of my lungs, to rapturous applause from the rest of the bar?  every time I tried to stop, I was goaded forth into the next verse?  (did the piano indeed sound like a carnival?)  Was I really and truly told assuredly that I was gay?  Did I really have an argument for what felt like hours with a fair-eyed girl who has severe trust issues and one fucked up gaydar?  despite the wedding ring and total pudgy married-guy look did I still come across as gay?  (my wife tells me that it can only be the broadway rendition of a billy joel song.  I begrudgingly concede)  Did I really hear someone who claimed to be a teacher misrepresent the very definition of a parallelogram?  Did she really say that a parallelogram could not have right angles?  Did I really scoff right at her and throw down the argument-crushing example of the square (QED biatch!)?  Evidently I did, because I do remember her backing me into a corner and beating my ass with a relentless barrage of haymakers, both rights and lefts, that left me bruised like a second-rate (albeit mathematically-savvy) prizefighter the next day.  Her-110 lbs at the very most, me twice that and then some on the most gravitationally-forgiving day, and I had no response but to cower in my own fucked-up rendition of the rope-a-dope.  Her: "flex your stomach so I can hit you." Me: "Are you joking?  that's me, flexing."  (#fat)  so I can tell you little to nothing about turf--I genuinely can't say for sure if that was the place we were at.  But since I asked right when I got there if I was allowed to yell, and the bartender said yes, yell to your heart's delight! I have to say four stars.  I would have said 5 but that looks really out of line with the rest of these reviews...

When I say I've experienced better, it's because I'm thinking of yogurtland and how their yogurt is 2x as good and half the price.  which for you mathphobes means an overall fourfold increase in happiness quotient.  The yogurt is decent but the selection lacked things that I wanted.  but being so expensive, I expected more.  the yogurt at golden spoon is much better too.  so i'd say go to one of these other places.

I really like sauce.  Ordinarily I get the sausage and carmelized onion pizza and it is really delicious.  The crust is slightly unconventional, more like a cracker than pizza dough, and very thin, but I consider that an acceptable nuance of their place.  My wife always gets the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza and although you know my perspective on arugula (tastes like fart) she insists it is the cornerstone of her very existence (in her words: "it's really good."  she understates).  However today I went against all that is good and right with the world and ordered a salad.  Turkey, avocado, and feta salad.  The feta was decent, the avocado was delightful, the turkey was lunch meat turkey cubes.  not a compliment.  The dressing was light and i definitely felt like i was doing something good for my body.  My body was surprised.  Anyway, the salad was a 3 out of five.  Decent, not wonderful.  So the waitress came and said that if I liked that dressing, they have a secret salad with the same dressing and all sorts of italian cold meats in it.  Sounds amazing!    So I asked her what gives with the secret salad.  Well it is an idea on the part of some of the higher ups to encourage ppl to return to the place and order the salad.  I say, just put your best shit on the menu, otherwise I won't come back.  So I was intrigued.  But do I like being engaged in a cunning ruse to make me return?  no!  So I browbeat the poor hapless waitress for a few minutes about whose idea it was and so on, and then told her I'd never return to sauce so long as i live.  But I will, because that salad sounds tasty as hell.  Plus, with their salads they serve a nice little bread roll which is pretty wonderful.  Also they serve wine and beer and who doesn't like that?

So this place was recommended to me by Dallas G which carries with it a special distinction all its own.  The first time I was forced to get the elote callejero which is a gigantic corn on the cob with seasonings and cotija cheese all over it.  Fucking delightful.  However, the watermelony water that I was forced to get was not good.  It's some drink that they have that I would not recommend to anyone.  So the next time we went I had the corn again and a torta, which is basically a sandwich with this unbelievably savory bread.  Like I've been to five or so different spanish speaking countries now and a torta pretty much means something different in each one, but this was ridiculously good.  So on the merits of the two food items I've gotten I give five glorious stars, brought back to earth by the crappy drink.  Four stars.  Go there, get the food, skip the watermelon goo and you will have a truly delightful meal.

Okay here's how I do it: peanut butter mixed with raspberry creame (sic) with white chocolate chips.  that was before, however, the day I refer to as enlightenment: the day I had the cheesecake chunks.  practically better than anything I've ever had.   so I now recommend some fruit flavor, such as the raspberry creame (sic) or strawberry, with a heavy dose of cheesecake bits.  deeeelightful.  for half the cost of other such establishments, yogurtland is truly happiness embodied.  also they have a root beer float flavor that's pretty tasty if you're into that...

The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.  Know thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.  Know thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.  Furthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose "for here," I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.  Know thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.  Here is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.  Don't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.  --------  My wife read the review, and by "read" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right.

A worthy effort. I had the nachos, which I only ordered because they are made with movie theater cheese. Which is how the gods eat their nachos. They open up a can of iridescent, not-real, fake cheese, the kind that alternatively could be pumped out of a spigot. Proper.   Anyway, this particular fake cheese varietal is green chile fake cheese, which has a hint of some flavor that displeases me mildly. But Rachel, the waitress, is very cute. A fact of which I approve.   They have Big Buck Safari so Dallas G can release his murderous rage on hapless computerized animals before returning to his i-won't-harm-you-if-you-dont-harm-me life.   And the nachos are covered with chicken, black beans, sour cream, guac, salsa... and such. Definitely worth ordering.   Great reverse happy hour 10-close and all day sunday. Woooot  So best of luck, 18 degrees. Your 2nd day open is a worthy effort.  I do have to say, though, one more thing about Rachel. She laughed at my story, and that gets her an A+ in my book.

There is a status quo with by the slice pizza joints that is far exceeded by Slices.  They make a gajillion different types of pizza and the crust is perfect.  the options are plenty and the quality of pizza is very good, especially considering the pizzas are sitting there waiting to be eaten.  Yes, it's true that this place is busy with college kids, and there was a day (sadly long passed) when that wouldn't have bothered me, but on the whole it is a really solid place to eat for lunch or dinner.  If you're in the mood for pizza you will not regret going here.

Monday night was a big one for me.  First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one.   So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry.   Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime.   We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!  My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite.   Really though, the food was phenomenal.

Note: my experience is based on many views of the website and multiple times calling the business.  This place is a joke.  I would ordinarily ham up the review in hopes of making you laugh but i don't want to water down the point of this review, which is that this place is absolutely horrifyingly useless.  We only tried it out because of the Groupon which offered $25 worth of food for $10.  Fine.  The groupon expires 10/18.  Fine.  So of course, being the procrastinators that we are, we waited until the 18th.  Which is why i didn't complain to them about the *two hour* delivery time, because I don't want to be that guy.  Although I will submit to you that if you're a business and you do a promotion, this is the sort of thing that you should maybe plan for.  Just a thought.  Go to their website and see if it doesn't remind you of a website from 1995--it's ridiculously low-budget and it isn't really user friendly.  When we tried to order delivery last night on the site, it said that the first delivery time available was 945a the NEXT MORNING.  Okay, fine.  So I called, because the site said that the hours were until 830 on a sunday.  I called at 705p and the manager answered--on the third time i called, btw--and told me that they had just closed.  ?  He said that they were having some glitch with the system and so they just decided to close.  He said to put in an order for tomorrow online and he'd get it to us.  So i tried that--except the site wouldn't let us order delivery for the next evening--it said the only available times for delivery were between 945a and 115p.  Useless.  So the next day we try and order during the day and guess what the first available time for delivery is?  yep--945a the next morning.  Unbelievable.  So i called the lady to order directly and she told me it was a two hour wait, i said it was fine, i gave her the order, she took my address, fine.  1:45 later, I get a call from the delivery driver, saying that he can't find my house number on the street.  That's because he was on the WRONG STREET because the lady on the phone GAVE HIM THE WRONG ADDRESS and he was a good half hour distance away from my house.  Understandably upset, he told me he probably wouldn't be able to get my food to me--then he stopped himself and said he'd call me back.  He didn't.  So I called Mobile Waiters to talk to the manager.  No apology.  I asked what would happen with the order and she said he'd "try" to get it to me but first he had to make a "quick stop" at a restaurant that closes "in two minutes" (it was 7:08p) and she didn't know when he'd get here.  So I told her to cancel my order and give me my money back (the overage after the groupon value, including tip), and she was like "okay."  That was it, no apology or explanation, no nothing.  Which I only mention to give you an idea of the level of customer service and competence you can expect.  Finally, she told me I'd have to take it up with groupon for my money back from them.  Awesome.  She wanted to give me a credit on my account for the money I'd spent, no more.  I declined because I don't ever want to deal with them again.  This place is a total embarrassment.  It's a great concept, but so is flapping your arms and flying.  ___________________  NOTE: the owner sent me a message and here is what she said.  I will accept the offer to redeem the groupon and I will post a subsequent review when it's warranted.  Hi Richard, My name is Brette, I am the owner of Mobile Waiters. I was informed about your order & the issue with the address. I do apologize about that confusion, the main issue that occurred is the fact that you live in an area that we do not deliver to which disrupted our system from applying the correct address. The other issue was the end of Groupon which as prepared as we were in terms of staffing completely threw us for a loop since it seems as though you were not the only "procrastinator" who waited until the last day to redeem. In either case there is no real excuse, just a horrible mishap. I really just wanted to apologize for your experience  & let you know that if you had an issue with Groupon in terms of getting your money back we would be more than happy to still offer a delivery to you & allow you to use the Groupon although it has expired already as we have done with some of our regular customers who had Groupons as well. I take pride in my company, I try my absolute hardest to make sure that everyone & anyone that uses us to have food delivered is happy in the end which is why I am reaching out to you to apologize.  Have a great day
