This used to be one of our favorite places for the nachos, which are still the best I've ever had. Then they took them off the menu. After that, I just did not have the heart to come back. The service is a little questionable too, if they get even a little busy. The last time I went, we waited 20 minutes before just giving up.

Very yummy food in a faux pub environment. It's funny, they definitely designed it to look "pubby," but of course this is the desert, so no one's buying that for a minute. Just good food, relatively large selection of beers, and a friendly wait staff.  It's also nice to have a patio where you can smoke. Given the Nazi-like stranglehold on places to eat and smoke, this is a Godsend. If you are a practitioner of the tobacconist arts, you definitely want to add this place to your list of acceptable stops.

I'm not a great fan of the coffee, but the ambiance is great. (And for the record, that's the first time on this site I've used the word, "ambiance.") If you want good coffee, I'm still going to point you to Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Company. But for a place to get together with friends, Xtreme Bean is fun.  If you don't want caffeine they have some pretty good fruit drinks. (A little too sweet for my tastes, but still good.)  I do like this place, despite the use of the word, "extreme" in their name - misspelled no less. But it's also close by to me - that won't help you, but it sure is good for me.

I just moved out of my apartment here after two years, and was happy living here the entire time. The facilities were always clean and working, the staff was always helpful and smiling, and the rent and utilities were a great bargain. The apartments are also very cute, with tons of closet space - I never had to buy a dresser because of the way they were set up.  This really is one of the best apartment experiences I've had.

Nello's is really good for Pizza salads and sandwiches. It's not fancy, but it's not grubby either.   The tortellini salad is great if you want to try something other than pizza.  QUICK WARNING: They're always closed on Mondays.

It's just not the same as it was when I was a kid. If you're going because it used to be great, don't bother seeking it out again.

I really love this place, for three reasons:  1) That nearly the entire restaurant is underground is really cool. There's something retro about that, though the place itself does feel modern.  2) It's romantic, mostly because there are no windows and so it has very low light. It isn't noisy either - everyone there (when I went anyway) seemed to understand that the mood was low key.  3) The lobster is actually fresh. They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course, but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery, whiffy lobster. If you're going to eat lobster without leaving town, pay the extra for it or stay home.  It is a fabulous date restaurant. SO LEAVE YOUR KIDS AT HOME. The darkness and closed in feeling didn't work with the one that was there when I was, which was the one downside - a downside the restaurant had nothing to do with, of course.  Otherwise, perfect.

Oh how far the mighty fall.  While the hip factor on this place has gone up and down over the years, at least they had semi-decent coffee. I went there today, and now even that's dead. It tasted like pencil shavings. And not those yummy, creamy pencil shavings either. They were the kinds you get from a pencil. Steeped in boiling water.  It's no wonder the place is usually abandoned. Well, that and all of the Starbuck's in every corner of the Earth...

Good because it's local, and you can sit outside and smoke. However, it is also highly, highly overrated. There is nothing special about the food or beer selection, and the parking situation is almost always horrid despite a large private lot.  Worst of all, it is usually peopled by soft, pudgy ASU kids. It's the kind of place sophmores and juniors go to, saying, "wow! This is so college! I am so in college now! Look how college I am! I'm going to flip my baseball cap around and put on some flip flops!"  For a real hole-in-the-wall, find a hole-in-the-wall. Casey Moore's is a place that was a hole-in-the-wall and is now firmly ASU establishment - a good place to network with the future VPs of Dupont.

Very pushy about getting people to give them "five stars" in online reviews. I've been told by several employees after some encounter, multiple times, "If we don't get a five on every review, we can lose our jobs." If that's true, the management here really, really sucks.   Outside of that, had to bring in my car twice to get a part replaced. The first time they seemed to not know why it was there, so I had to pick it up and try again the following week. Thanks, guys!

Durant's is a throwback to early Phoenix - which is great if you like the time travel element. The food is great, though a bit expensive.   Regarding the last review, they're right - stay away from the seafood. If you want lobster, go to the Salt Cellar in Scottsdale. For Steak and martinis and seeing the way things used to be out here, Durant's is a LOT of fun.

The pre-eminent Tempe music store. I cased Eastside for much vinyl in high school, and they always had the coolest stuff.

This property has come a long way since the Caleo Resort and the Sunburst Resort - the former names. The current iteration doesn't have the problems you'd read in other reviews of the place - it is clean, modern, and has a great "pool life." It's also close to the Scottsdale shops, and close to all of the Scottsdale golf. It really is a gem.

It's hard to be hard on a hardware store. As long as they have the thing you came in looking for, all should be fine. What bothered me about my trip to this Lowe's was no one seemed all that informed about what department can help you or not.  I had a pipe, and I needed to get it cut down. So I went to plumbing. There a gentleman, who wasn't doing anything, told me he could not and to try Electrical. (Actually, what he said was, "Yeah - no. You might try.... uh... you might go to Electrical, because.... that's not... something....." Then even he had enough of his inability to communicate and stopped trying. I moved on to Electrical, and left him in peace to research whatever it was that was so important on his computer. (Sudoku? GED courses? Playmate of the Month? I will never know.)  I moved on to the Electrical Department. They pointed me in the direction of lumber. Lumber just said, flatly, that they couldn't cut a steel pipe with their saws, just lumber. What I loved here was that I was told this as if I was the moron. I know you can't cut steel with a ripsaw, and told this person that Electrical sent me. The Lumber guy said I should go to Plumbing. ("There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza." Anyone else remember that song?)  Ultimately I found someone in some department who happened to have a hack saw and a measuring tape. So I cut the pipe myself, thanked this solitary helpful employee, and went to pay for my goods.   Thankfully, there is a Home Depot not too far north on Indian Bend. I would go there instead. Here is their Yelp review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-home-depot-scottsdale-2

I've always loved Coffee Bean, and not just because they aren't $tarbucks.   Their coffee is just plain better. The people there also know coffee - they aren't there because McDonald's wasn't hiring this week. They can tell you about the coffee they sell, and help you find what you want.  Apparently they don't have wi-fi, so if that's what you need with your coffee look elsewhere. This place just has good coffee and treats.   I'm really a fan of the Black Forrest Ice Blended. Especially now, in the Summer. I'm so glad there's now one close to work.

I'm a huge fan of Fresh and Easy because the food there is good, inexpensive, and they have great deals on several items.   It has the look of yet another hippie market, but in fact it has normal food, does not smell of patchouli oil, and sells products you've heard of before, not just knockoffs emblazoned with the word "organic." Those products are there too, but at least one is given the choice.  Trader Joe's this is not - though the smaller size is roughly the same, it has better selection and will cost a lot less to find food for dinner.

Beyond the nostalgia, I just really love this place. I've been with this library since I was in kindergarten - they were in another building then. It's grown into a brilliant place to find the books you need, or to get work done in one of the private rooms.

Potentially a good replacement for the now gone Tempe Kyoto Bowl. The food is very good, and is prepared in front of you so you know it hasn't been moldering in a pot for hours in the back.   The employees upsell a little too much for my taste, but they're new and I think that will stop over time. They also bespeak the healthfulness of the food. (Well really, they talked up the "healthyness," but that's wrong, food isn't healthy. People are.) This may just be my own personality disorder, but I don't want employees getting that chatty with me when I'm ordering lunch. Stop trying to convince me how good your food is Daniel Webster, just rustle me up a plate and I'll get back to you! Sheesh!   It certainly doesn't make me feel sluggish like overly fatty food usually does, it has a lot more vegetables in it, I was able to get my Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice, and it is comparably priced to Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sams.  While they just opened, which usually means you can't really trust the Yelp review until they've settled in a bit more, it is part of a chain, so I don't think there will be much of a change. The food is yummy, it doesn't take long, and it isn't terribly expensive for what you get. (My Teriyaki Bowl was $6.80)
