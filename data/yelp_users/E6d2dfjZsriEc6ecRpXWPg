The store side is good but the pharmacy is the worst . Poor attitudes and customer service from the techs . It's almost as if they are annoyed that you're making them work . I waited in line 30 minutes with one car ahead and once I got to the window I waited another 15 minutes because the tech put my information in wrong . Im transferring my prescriptions somewhere else . Not worth the frustration .

Don't use them to move state to state . They will hold your belongings  hostage and not return your calls . Basically they try to extort you to get you to pay more money to get your stuff back or else you're waiting 2 weeks . Depends if they get another job in your area until they do get another job ,they put your stuff in a truck and then unload it into a storage facility . Then when they bring you your belongings it's in a truck mixed up with other people's property . I ended up missing a few art pieces .

If you're looking to get ripped off and have ridiculous amounts of money snatched out of your account 5 days after your "free " class, go to this gym . It advertised a week free trial  but out of nowhere my daughters card was charged $90 and then she was told she owes another $189 after she told them she didn't sign up for this membership . Very tacky  sale practices .  Strong arming struggling students for their money . Misleading bullied teenagers looking for help . Well ufc gym is the real bully . I will be reporting them to the attorney generals office . The BBB is fully aware of this business and I hope that some type of fine will be imposed . Please beware . I wish I could give zero stars .

These are the best movers I've ever used . They were quick , clean and friendly . The rate was very fair . The movers Freddy and Wilson unloaded our 26 foot trailer within 45 minutes . They other movers we used before this charged triple and took a lot longer .  They didn't break anything and they were very helpful . I would highly , highly recommended them and I will definitely use them again . Thank you .

My son wasn't feeling so well and having classic symptoms of strep throat so I took him to this location . Walk in, the front desk attendant stares at me and asks me how can she help . Seemed very out of it . I told her my son needed to be seen . She asked for insurance card and my ID . I told her that he's under my insurance and I have my card  and his card number . She said she would need his card number . I told her ok I have that . She stared at me blankly and said that she needs his card number I said ok I'm ready her it is . She says that if he has a number he's should have a card . I told her, once again that I have the card number and his father has his card  . Another 3 second blank stare and she said next time I need to have the card not just the number or else he won't be seen . I asked her is he going to be seen today , she said yes then I asked if she wanted the card number . She said not yet . Took my ID and gave me a 4 question questionnaire to fill out. I started to fill that out and she stated I had to sit down and do that because it violates HIPPA. No one else was in the office but I complied and asked for my ID back . After some hesitation she have it back . Completed the paperwork 30 seconds later  and she was gone . I waited and another girl with gold chains on came to the front , took the questionnaire . Asked for my ID . I have her my ID and she puts it down and walks away and have me some paper work to fill out . The other girl came back , I asked for my ID and she said that I have to step to the right  because me standing at that window violates HIPPA . Even thought that's where you have to check in . I asked her why , because I never heard of anything like that . And she said "we're not going to do anything with your ID" which made me think that's exactly what was going to happen . She said it was because they have patient records out and I told them , from what I know , them having patient records out in the open for the public to see is a violation of HIPPA. I asked them is there a reason I'm getting such resistance because I'm trying to just get help for my son . The front desk girl became very rude and demeaning. I asked her if she was high . She jumps up , throws my check in paper at me and says that I can go somewhere else . I ask to speak to he office manager they refused . They said to call corporate which I did .

My daughter and her husband live in this complex and it has been a pain from day one . Well now they have a newborn and I came to visit and immediately noticed it was extremely hot . They said that they have called the office numerous times but they haven't fixed it . So I opened the windows and immediately I noticed that they were surrounded with mold . Both windows . I've never seen anything like it . I went to the office for my daughter because she wasn't able to walk due to her surgery . I told them that the Ac was not working and that they also needed another air  filter. The representative at the office said that they were out of Filters and that the maintenance wouldn't be back until Monday and they would come out then . I also showed them the pictures of the mold and she said that they would look at that but in the meantime spray it with bleach . Monday came, they never showed up . Even after multiple calls . Tuesday no show and no call back . Tuesday night  my daughter sent an email advising them about the repair request and told them it had yet to be fulfilled . Wednesday morning they show up and fix the AC And clean up the mold . Well I received a rude email from Lindsey , the office manager , saying that my daughters husband would have to email her if they need a repair done . Even though the repair had been completed . Also , they're both on the lease . I called her back letting her know that he email came from my daughter and she said that the email didn't have my daughters information on it . I told her it did , the unit number along with her contact information . Well she became very nasty , and said that they have to crack the Windows when they run the AC or heat  because of the mold . I told her it sounds like there is a structure defect. They had not been there even a year and I've never seen that amount of mold on a shower let alone a window . She became defensive , denied any calls for repairs and hung up . With that type of attitude I can see why this place is the way that it is . Please look up the amount of police calls that have made to this location before renting.  You can do that with the city of Mesa police records . Also when you take the tour , make sure you look around the whole property . Take a stroll and you will  notice the strong marijuana smell . Make sure that they show you the whole property not just the nice units in the front . Sorry for the long review but just wanting to give you all a heads up before making a mistake .

This place is so good ! And the people are very nice . I'm picky when it comes to Thai food and this place is perfect . And when you ask for hot , you get hot . The beef is so tender and flavorful . They give you ALOT of shrimp in the shrimp fried rice . They're the big juicy shrimp too . I could go on and on. I'll definitely be back .
