I always get greeted and offered assistance as soon as I come in. I never had this type of customer service in Chandler, thank you for making me feel welcomed!   Even though I only come here for my medication, I still feel it's important to acknowledge your customers, and at this location they are very consistent!

I usually don't have a great experience in any bed bath & beyond, but we had a great experience today at this store and it was our first time too!  We were greeted as soon as we arrived, which is always pleasant to hear. No help at all on the floor. One lady was helping another lady at the bedding section and we waited about 10 min and she never acknowledged us, so we left.   Our checkout experience was very quick efficient and friendly by Kim the bridal consultant, we were just a little sad we didn't win any door prizes.   Overall, we were very satisfied and will be returning!

Amazing wings! They have a cool little pool table to play. My fianc√© and I go there for lunch on occasion away from our kids to have a mini date and we have a beer and 10 piece wings and we have a blast! Great customer service!

Crappy service, the girl techs seemed like they were talking about me because they kept looking at my hands and feet and laughing. The girl doing my pedi kept looking at her watch while messaging me and did it half assed. I will not be coming back. Btw I moved here to AZ from Cali 3 weeks ago and I paid $85!! For crappy rude service.

Carnitas nachos are amazing and great happy hour deals. Only thing that outside it smells like pee but I stay inside. Outside its a fun atmosphere since they have all sand in the patio

We had such a great time here. Great selection of food. Only down fall was that a game player hit my car in the parking lot and the security guards weren't that helpful at all.

I am new to Maricopa, moved here from Chandler and was skeptical to try a new nail place but I needed to get my nails done for my bachelorette party. I went in on a Tuesday morning with my 4 yr old son and was greeted by  an older lady and a gentleman. They accommodated my son with a chair next to me and sat me right away. I went in for a pedicure with callus remover and a gel manicure. My "manicure" was just a brush of the cuticle pusher, semi file and nail cut down (uneven btw) very sloppy gel polish on TOP of my cuticles and top coat half on my nails and half on my fingers. I was amazed to hear the lady say "ok your done, beautiful right?" Are you serious?? The pedicure was ok not amazed and the polish was sloppy. I was in a rush so I paid and decided to call my bank to ask for a refund. By the next few hours, to my surprise my gel polish came almost all off and went in that Saturday to ask them to fix it. They sat me right away and said they would. They made me wait until they got done with their 3!!! Clients and then helped me. Same lady! But this time she did actually did a decent manicure. Still I will never come here again.

I moved from Cali last year in May and have been looking a hair stylist since I am very very with who touches my hair. Andrea is AMAZING! Very knowledgeable and listens carefully to what I want! I always come out a very satisfied customer! I found her over the summer and I would be crazy to go anywhere else!

Let me start off by saying, WOW! I went in for my very first Brazilian wax, OMG, on Thursday and I was so nervous, mostly because someone else was going to see my who haa! Eeek! I prepped and watched YouTube videos (I don't recommend it unless you want to scare yourself silly) and read up on it as much as I could, I wanted everything to go perfect since on Saturday 5-21-16 I was getting married.   The front desk ladies was kind and welcoming and asked me to take a seat after I was checked in and advised me that I was going to called in soon (Yikes! Nerves are heighten). I was called in by the aesthetician TY, (at least that's what I think her name is, maybe I was too nervous to hear her name but it does say it on my next appointment 6-11-16 TY)   I walk into the room and TY was extremely comforting as if I was in a room with my BFF.  The first strip was unexpected and a bit painful but unexpectedly tolerable. I did not scream or cry, which I was expecting to do so can you say accomplishment? I think so!! We were both talking with made the experience enjoyable and kept my mind at ease.   She recommended I use a serum to help with bumps and ingrown hair and as of today 5-24 still no bumps or ingrown hairs! Score! Miracle serum! Definitely hooked and definitely will return!  PS My new husband is very happy with the results!

Super friendly! Let me say first though.. Appointments are recommended!    Mary did my pedi and gel mani.  Her attention to detail actually surprised me. I got a sugar scrub pedi, amazing! And a gel mani. Both reasonably priced. I've moved to chandler 3 weeks ago and I think I found my new place. I went to pink polish (DONT Recommend) 2 weeks ago and got crappy service and they charged me $85 for a mediocre pedi and mani.  I definitely will return! Thank you!

Try the chicken! They give you a taste before you buy. And the atmosphere is very casual. Love eating here.

Ok, to be fair every time I come here I am always satisfied but yesterday was a different story! I waited a while to write a review, just to be sure I knew all aspects of the business.   When you walk down the pathway to the entrance of this enormous building, you see posters of coming movies, typical. To your right of the building you see a HUGE screen where on some Saturday's they play free movies at dusk for everyone. See your local listings for dates and showings.   Inside to your left is a concession stand and to your right, ticket counter for both theaters, general and VIP (21+). Center of the lobby is a cool seating area with a lot of tv/screens, to your left of the lobby is a restaurant and an arcade.   We watched the 10:35pm showing of Xmen, and 3/4 of the way into the movie, all the lights of the theater turned ON!!!! Really???  we kept yelling to have them turn it off, then I walked out to look for help, 15 min later!!!! I found someone who looked like he wasn't to happy to have to help me and said he would take care of it, after looking at me from head to toe! Creepy!! EWWW!!! 5 min later the lights were off. After the show we couldn't find anyone to complain to so we left. We will be emailing to complain, this was outrageous!

Friendly staff, I'm new to Maricopa and we wanted to try something new and take the kids out since they are off school now. Took them here for the pool and they had a lot of fun on the splash pad. $5 for adults and $3 for kids!

I moved from Cali to AZ 2 years ago and I found this gem after 6 months of trying out different nail salons and I will not go anywhere else! They are amazing!! All techs working there are amazing! I alway get the deluxe pedicure and gel manicure.

I stand behind them 100% they are awesome even if they would chip (which they won't) they will always fix it happily. One time I got this pink color that faded and they did a polish changed at no charge just because I wasn't happy. All the techs are very detailed oriented. They will not finish unless you are happy. Their services are not rushed and you really get your money's worth.

I always get surprised at how everyone is always so friendly and look like they enjoy working there. They didn't make me feel dumb for not knowing the menu, in fact they helped me decide what option was best for me. I forgot the name but I got the burger with the bacon. Yum!! And the chocolate concrete custard in a cup, wow! Delicious!! Will be returning!! Thank you!!
