Pets are like family - and Dr. Bracken and his staff treat them as such. Cannot say enough about how wonderful this place is. Trustworthy and attentive to all your pets needs.

Flora Bella really rocked!!!  They did an amazing job on the Ronald McDonald - A McNight to Remember Gala this evening.  Thanks Rick and Krista too - you guys kept us laughing.  The decor set up was flawless and they delivered beyond expectations.

Locally owned, small business located in the Scottsdale Airpark. So accommodating and lots of choices for your special celebration! I have used and known Munkeboe for over 5 years. They are great to work with.

My husband and I decided to check out the Chymist for lunch today.  Parking lot busy - The Chymist empty..... We  seated ourselves as instructed and waited to be noticed.  The bartender/waitress finally came over and had such a bad attitude!  She was very short and snippy with her answers and not very interested in us.  My husband put down his menu and without hesitation said "let's leave"     We walked over to Wildflower Bread Company where we were greeted with smiles and wonderful food:).  Stick to the Chymist for happpy hour - where you will get half price apps and a drink for the attitude.

I'm not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants - but Cantina Laredo consistently delivers on food and service.  They have an updated menu with some new items as well as some old favorites like the carne asada.   They also have a menu just for lunch with some lower priced options and a kids menu with both mexican and american food choices.   It will please even the picky eaters!

Generic substitution without customer approval is not acceptable. Profit over patient care.

We dined here this evening for an early birthday dinner.  The fish special - Cod was absolutely AMAZING!  One of the most flavorful dishes I have ever eaten.   If you haven't been to this Bistro - you are missing out on a really good place to dine.

Dr. Defelice performed surgeries on two of my children this year. My youngest needed wisdom teeth (all 4) removed and my oldest had an infection with severe bone loss located in his front lower mouth.  During their appointments, Dr. Defelice was patient, professional and comforting to both my children. He walked them (and me) through the procedure and what to expect before and after. They both trusted him - which was really important prior to going into surgery. The wisdom teeth extraction was quick and recovery was as expected. The oldest was ecstatic that Dr. Defelice was able to save his two front teeth since 2 other oral surgeons had recommended extraction and costly implants.  I would (and have) highly recommend Dr. Defelice.

Great location to ride your bike to and enjoy  Sunday.  Unfortunately, the positive experience stops there.  Overwhelmed with the drinking crowd, the service was minimal, glasses were dirty and the food is not worth the effort.
