I went out to Matadors with my friend Sara on a Sunday night. Walking into Matadors is like walking into a super Wal-Mart at 2am; empty, Large and impressive. There was more staff standing around than patrons. We sat at the bar and I whipped my computer out to start my meeting and ordered an ala Carte seafood burrito and a bottle of beer. Sara's attempt to sober up with water is acknowledged and ridiculed for a few seconds I get into my meeting and the food comes. The seafood inside of the burrito was not really seafood at all. Sara describes the mash inside the wrapped tortilla as consuming half cooked sea monkeys. The only saving grace on this boring tasteless plate was the refried beans. Soft and cheesy, the beans saved the day. I order another dos equis lager and put my attention back to my online meeting. From the corner of my ear I hear the twinkling keys of the old time piano in the corner. I look up to see Sara stroking the ivories in the dark corner of the bar. She is on the phone with her mother excited she can remember a tune played when she was a child. We leave Matadors with... "Let's blow this taco stand"... The bill was less than $30 bucks.

I arrive and like at most places on the phone... The place is pretty much empty for a Sunday night being right across from a light rail station. I ask the waitress to seat me on a couch and I follow and continue my important phone conversation. The restaurant is located below some loft in central phoenix and has an urban contemporary concrete feel to it. There is a full menu but I focus in on the cheese and wine menu. I order the three-cheese sampler and a glass of wine, a medium red from Santa Monica California. The wine is smooth and the cheeses flavorful and after waiting 20 minutes for it to arrive I guess prune juice and cardboard would have been just as  flavorful. I guess good cheese takes time to cut. The decor was a bit mixed matched with concrete grays and pastel curtains. I felt like I was more in an Austin Powers flick than in a hip wine bar. The wait for service was considerable considering that the place was one third full. The bill came out to more than $50 bucks, I would say a little pricey for the wasting my time; it took a couple minutes for my eyes to adjust when I left.  I kept seeing pastel shower curtains everywhere!

About every other day on my way into work I have a choice to make. Do I make a right and go to Mickey D's for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, then have to wait at the light to cross over the traffic at Deer Valley. Or do I make a left on 23rd then right into the Wendy's parking lot for a new Artisan Sausage sandwich? The first time I made that decision I felt like going to catholic confession. "Dear Father, forgive me for I have sinned. It has been 24 years since my last confession. I cheated on my favorite fast food breakfast today..." After that day, I always drive by and wave at the relationship with McDonalds that I kicked to the curb for the hotter better breakfast fast food. The sandwich is awesome, soft artisan bread with fresh cracked egg (yoke still intact) asiago cheese and a "not greasy" sausage patty and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes are country style wedges with the skin still on them. The coffee rivals' dunkin doughnuts and the drive through is super efficient. Can you believe that they actually take the time to look at my CC and thank me by name? Before you go out to your local Wendy's in search of breakfast bliss, check to see if they serve the new menu items. I have driven 15 miles off course and to three restaurants looking for the new menu items in the east valley. Not all restaurants carry the new breakfast menu.   McDonalds I am filing for divorce and I want alimony for all those years that you could have provided me a healthier better tasting breakfast sandwich. My breakfast lawyer will be contacting you soon.

I started a policy at AmFam with Paul's agency through a friend that got me a great deal on a bundled policy. Everything was going well and the small amount of customer service that I needed was attended to until I removed my girlfriend car and added another vehicle through the agency's associate. I received a bill saying that I owed in excess of $2000 and when I called this particular associate to help me out, she would take my call and then never get back to me with the resolution. I took the agency's word that they were working out the problem. A couple weeks go by and I call Paul to find out what the progress is and he blows me off with a promise to "get back to me". When he didn't get back to me  I receive a notice from AmFam that my newly added policy is in jeopardy of being cancelled. I immediately call the associate who promises to get back to me with a resolution and the amount that I have to pay to become current. I never receive a call of course and contact AmFam's 800 number. The phone agent explains to me that I am a little over a month behind and that my policy was suspended 2 days prior. I get everything worked out in 15 min on the customer service call than I did in two weeks with a LOCAL agent. The last order of business was to fire my agent through phone customer service and write in to the notes to Paul's manager the reason why I will never use Paul G's AmFam agency again.

Last minute decision to stop here because of the few vegan items on the menu my wife was able to eat. The ambiance was great but man the Flys all over the cookies and pastries. I saw three Flys having a picnic on one of the cupcakes in the window at the register, I watched Flys land on every single item, NO covers on the trays! Maybe the regurgitated fly saliva is the secret ingredient on the sweets, but for a group that made to to a TV show this mistake is novice. I had the chorizo omlett it was over salted and the cheese wasn't melted. My wife enjoyed her tofu scrambler. The waffle that came for our son had previous burnt waffle residue all over it. Come here to pop open your laptop and take advantage of no table service which equates to no one bothering you while you sip coffee and hide from the sun.

Ok this was my first time at the Tempe Symphony Orchestra, or any symphony orchestra for that matter. I arrived early to find a friend had been the first in line in anticipation of a huge crowd. I was told earlier in the day by the box office lady to get there early because tickets would sell out fast. I'm glad I did I had the opportunity to chat and catch up with a couple of friends and the thought of running into the theater first was exciting even if I have to stampede over a few grey hairs in wheel chairs. The doors were suppose to open at 6:30 pm and did about ten minutes later. At that time the line looked like a polling place for a Bush election; it was long. We headed for the second floor balcony and sat just left of center with a fantastic view of the stage. I headed to the bar and was surprised to learn that I can take my wine back to my seat without having to place a security deposit for carpet cleaning. Drinks were average price $6 dollars for the house wine and $6 dollars for a cocktail. Not bad considering the tickets are free. I don't know much about classical music or orchestras but what I can say about the acoustics from the second floor balcony is that the sound from the back of the stage was more clear than the instruments in the front. At intermission I ventured back to the bar and then onto the patio with the negative edge pool that looks out over Tempe Town Lake. The fire pits were well placed and flowed well with the water and the mood of the night. I sat through the second act with a new found respect for classical musicians and look forward to returning to TCA for more opportunities to out seat gray hairs and drink in public to a refined art that some may say is reserved for the privileged and I say is reserved for my entertainment.

We pulled up to the Rose and Crown, Sara and me looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders and got out of the car. The place is an old house converted into a small restaurant. There is a large inviting porch with seats and heaters. At just inside the door there is a welcome station that doubles as a host area. We ordered our drinks from here and headed out onto the porch. I ordered a beer, a kilt lifter to be precise. Sara asked for the cheapest cabernet and she received a large glass sporting one third of the bottle. We both decided to order the pub platter, half an order of fish and chips and a bowl of New England clam chowder. The service was fast and sitting on the porch felt comfortable. The food was great the portions were good and the price was fabulous. The parking was easy, on Sunday right in front of the pub. Any other day the Rose and Crown will be a little mote difficult to get to. Bill total was less than $30 bucks a bargain for a cozy little hangout next to ASU.

Im out with my friend Sara and we have visited a few places prior in the evening looking for the best hangouts close to the light rail stops. We had drive this night and we parked across the street from Matadors and in front of Hanny's, a department store turned restaurant. Sara was already in the car when I turned around and peered into the window of the hip new lounge. There was no sign in the front and I had to ask the bartender what the name of the place was. A clean contemporary lounge with stainless steel and concrete mixed in with black leather that extrudes and odor reminiscent of its old department store days. I notice one of my favorite beverages on the back of the menu and order it without hesitation. This will be my fifth of the night, a Brazilian caipirinha, Sara orders a dry Chianti and a bar plate, prosciutto with fresh Parmesan and melon; Ironic since she is a vegetarian. The music is a good mix of high energy, house and electronica with a little pop.  The DJ was spinning and watching over the bar through an opening above the door like a war prisoner in his inaccessible cage. The bartender throws me a bone about the downstairs lounge that is open and draws a crowd for late night activities. Walking to the bathrooms upstairs was an adventure. On the way to the stairs is an opening with a glass floor that is about twenty feet above glass; that reflects the glass twenty feet above my head and everything between. I'm drinking a very difficult drink to perfect, the mojito. With the caipirinha falling ever so slight on its mark in sugar department, I am giving the bartender another opportunity. And it's right on the money with the mojito. Sara is eager to get to the other 3 stops left in our night but its hard to leave the growing Sunday crowd and shiny objects that fill this new wonderland. We go upstairs and take our picture in the lighted mirrors before we leave.  The bill was $ 36 bucks.

On first appearance this hotel is your typical franchise hotel inside and out. From the gold rating you would assume that the customer service would be outstanding and it is. Ive stayed one night and really enjoyed the clean room and free (continental buffet) breakfast.  So why am I giving them such a low rating? Management is less to be desired. The GM is the week link and the results will be the loss of their gold status. Too bad too because the rest of the staff Rocks!

For a name like camarones (shrimp in Spanish) you would think that the ceviche would be served with some cojones (explertive for strong or brave in Spanish) but instead the katsup flavored pansey shrimp dish fell short at best. I had a three item combo that was slathered with microwaved melted cheese. The chicken taco a chicken filled sopopillo and the adobada beef all tasted of chafer water. The taco and sopopillo chicken were identical and flavorless. The adobado was so broken down that it resembled ground beef. The only salvation to the dish was the delicious tortilla and the table salsa left over from the chips. No wonder this huge beautiful building is empty. The positive was that the wait staff was friendly And very attentive. I wont be wasting another cent in camarones until they get out of the catering business.

So I read the other two reviews and thought that a chicken bowl would be the perfect portion for lunch today. I also chose to get the Sizzling bowl cause I like a little spice in my life. First off it is a little hard to find since it is inside of the Rainbow Doughnut place. Look for the flag on Deervalley. I stood in line behind a guy from a local catering place. That alone tells me not to go to that caterer. But also that the food must be good. Im halfway through my bowl as I write this and wiping the sweat from my brow. It is the perfect amount of heat and the teriyaki flavor comes through just fine. Its cheap, and delicious. I will be back for more.

I have had Sushi in three different countries non of which are Japan. I love sushi and have long sought a rival to my favorite Sushi restaurant  Islands Sushi and PuPu bar inside the Crown Plaza San Diego. I am still searching; however Kanpai has come the closest in Arizona.   If you have the time GET THERE! if you dont have the time stop what you are doing and GET THERE!  The fish is fresh and the rolls actually have flavor. For the price the size of the rolls make RA look like preschool meals. Besides where else can you go in the valley and fit 30 of your closest friends inside your own private Karaoke room?   The way I see it is I have about 10 more rolls to explore then Ill move on to the actual cooked menu. Im hungry now, whos up for Sushi  To my beloved RA I would like to say  You meant nothing to me, I used you for a while and now it is time for me to move on. I found the one I like more than you. And yes you do look fat in those jeans.

Was in North Phoenix and the wifey wants Pho, the closest place to grab it was at Rice Paper. She places the order and I head there to pick it up. Fist off who builds a door that walks right into the toilet washroom. It was awkward to enter the building and dodge a woman coming out of the bathroom to wash her hands. The waitstaff were all hanging around the bar gleaming over the one seated table, and the welcome was less than enthusiastic. Our food was waiting for us on the bar and I paid and left as quickly as possible. We ordered the following: combo pho minus the tripe, veggie pho, chicken pho and some spring rolls. Now my wife is vegan and is very attentive to what she orders. Rice Paper claimed the broth to be vegitarian, however when we got into mixing our soup we noticed that it was the same broth as the other soups we ordered. The broth was overly salted and didn't have the nice fragrant smell like other places that don't suck. My brother ordered the Pho without tripe and guess what? They gave him tripe. My chicken Pho was mediocre and with enough lime juice and Sriracha tasted fine. Had the soup been descent, had the experience picking up my food been pleasant the prices are not so bad. All in all we spent $40 bucks for the experience to cross this restaurant off the list. Next time the wifey wants Pho, I'll spend the extra gas to get to Tempe.
