I work at the sundevil auto right down the street. Me and my techs eat here 2 to 3 times a week !!!!  The service is absolutely amazing and the food is to die for !!! If I was not worried about having a heart attack from the delicious food I would eat here every day !!!!   Well done and keep it up.

Horrible experience. I went to get my wisdom teeth out and was told I needed to make a $100 deposit to get my appointment set up. That's perfectly fine  but I was at no point told that I need to pay all $1400 up front before I have them taken out ! And on top of that they kept saying that my insurance did not sign me to their location even though I have been told by my insurance that everything is taken care of .  Worst experience I have ever had to deal with. The only good part was the dental assistant that was talking to me in the room before my surgery.  Other than that I will never come back to this place in a million years !!!!

Great place really helpful techs !!  HOWEVER  the younger girl who answered the phone was completely rude!!  Im a customer service manager my self and I get it answering the phone isnt fun, but dont make the person on the other end feel stupid for calling especially since I was calling to ask about adding another $200 in upgrades. I think I will just do them my self now .

I work around the corner at sun devil , and I have to say this place is absolutely amazing!  The food is so tasty and at a great price. The only problem I am having now is what to get for lunch when I go there everyday for the next month haha!  Great staff as well !!!!!!!
