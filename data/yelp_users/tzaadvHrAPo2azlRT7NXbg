Good food.....good beer! And great pumpkin spice beer (if you get it while it's in season). My only complaint it's that it gets hot  inside in the summer.

Good food. Large portions. Right price. What more can I say? Lunch was a success and I will be going back!

This was my first trip to Lo-Lo's and I'm now officially a fan. I had the mix and match that consisted of a fried chicken breast, a fried strip of catfish, a waffle, and some Mac'N Cheese. Both the chicken and catfish were moist on the inside and crispy on the out. The mac was creamy and fresh and the waffle had a hint of cinnamon. I will definitely be going back to try some other menu items. Oh, and they have Kool-Aid on tap if you have the need...

I stated eating at the Los Favoritos in Chandler about 7 years ago. Since that time, I have visited just about every restaurant in the valley and have found them to be consistently good. As with any chain, every once and a while you will get a bad meal but overall I cannot recommend a better place to get a breakfast burrito anytime of the day! Yes, they do serve other food but I have limited myself to the rolled tacos and breakfast burritos which, by the way, are big enough to squelch my hunger most of the day. I recommend the chorizzo, but your tastes may vary.

This place is awesome. It really feels like your just off the beach in Rocky Point. I will stopping by here whenever I'm in the neighborhood.

The Mesquite Shrimp Tacos are spot on! There is nothing more satisfying than a slice of Baja on a Friday.

Being owned by PF Chang's, I was really expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered the Spicy Korean Chicken, a cup of Hot and Sour Soup, and a drink. While the food was cooked perfectly there really was no flavor at all. The soup tasted like a beef broth made with buillion cubes without a single hint of sour or spice. The Spicy Korean Chicken was moist, but unless your idea of spicy is black pepper your out of luck. Yes, I know you can add some spice after the fact but when you order something spicy you expect SOME form of heat. Overall, it was not worth my $12 for lunch. I will give it another shot as I know this may have been a one off, but right now I'd rather eat at Panda Express.

This place has an awesome lunch menu! My next review will come after I've had a chance to eat dinner and enjoy some wine!
