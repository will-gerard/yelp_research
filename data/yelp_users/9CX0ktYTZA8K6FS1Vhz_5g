I love Rustlers Rooste & I think every person who lives in the valley or visits should go here! We go here every few months and love it!!! The only reason they are getting a 4/5 stars is because every time we go there we don't get the best service, and have to ask several times for whatever we need & it's a tad bit expensive. Other than that it is always a great time, great entertainment, and great food! I'd definitely recommend it!!!!!

Well the first time we ate here it was TOGO & that was because I was craving French toast so we settled for this & hot damn was there cinnamon roll French toast bomb! When we went in to get our food it was packed which was great and our food came out in a jiffy! I can't wait till we go in and eat!!

Well let's start off by saying I love cheesecake, I mean who doesn't!? We come here every hear and there & will remain too, it's a nice restaurant. Tonight was super busy which was weird since it's a Thursday, but great for them! When we were seated we waited close to 10 minutes before our waiter came over (which was fine they have a HUGE menu). When she did I had to wait for my lemonade for another 10, and we also ordered one cocktail and that took about another 10. We got the chicken Caesar as well as the bacon bacon cheeseburger & they were both delicious and came out in enough time and delicious! I did have to wait another 5ish (give or take) for mine after he got his though, which if any has to wait I'm a firm believer in women first. We also ordered two cheesecakes to go which I'm about to eat and so excited! For what we got it was a little bit more than we would've liked, but hey you can't win. Probably go back in another year or so like normal!

Definitely not a sushi or seafood person, but had to go here for a big family dinner and was surprised at how good it was! I don't like some of the food just because I don't, it's as simple as that, but for the most part the food was great! I got the beef and broccoli and surprisingly it was DELICIOUS! I ate all of the beef and broccoli and loved the sauce it came with! I also ate some of my families food and like it too! Can't wait to go back!

OH MY GOSH I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago & have been back like two or three times already! The first time we were there we had great service & the second time we had a very strange composing older lady as our server & that made it kind of awkward for us at times. Definitely recommend pretty much everything there! I love there pazookie original cookie dessert! You also can't go wrong with their burgers, salads, ribs, or appetizers! & THERE PORK IS TO DIE FOR! I can't wait to bring my coupon and go back! Also don't forget to sign up for there rewards system, it's awesome!!! Yay!

Went there for our anniversary and was very pleased! The food was terrific as well as the mixed drinks! We got a peach cocktail and it tasted delicious! We both got an 8 ounce sirloin along with a baked potato and it was awesome! The baked potato definitely sealed the deal!  The manager came over and gave us some truffles to take home along with a gift card for our anniversary! It is expensive but very nice and romantic for a special occasion! Really awesome!

Went here for lunch today for the first time and was very impressed! The inside was decorated very cute for the holidays and it was surprisingly busy inside! We got the potato skins to share first and they were delicious, the chipotle sour cream definitely made that dish! We both got the cheeseburgers and they were some of the best ones we've ever eaten! I wish they had some different dessert options though. We will definitely be back again and would also love to try there dinner menu!

Went there expecting a grand place with all different ice cream and tons of sweets and sugar and I was not impressed. We walked in and the floor was absolutely disgusting, the restaurants smelt old & like pee, the tables were very worn out as were the chairs and bar. We got out order Togo to walk around downtown outside the shops which was nice, but it just tasted like normal Dryers ice cream you can get at the grocery store. Definitely highly recommend a re-vamp at this place & a deep clean. Won't be back for a long time unfortunately.

Worst place you could ever live at. The management is super rude after they've gotten your money and deposits from you and you've moved in. Management doesn't listen to you when you try to ask why your prices are going up or that you aren't paying the difference, they just say we will bill you X amount at the end of your lease. Every month you deal with rent prices going up and also new fees that are being established. A big issue we had was they entered our apartment without permission on several occasions and startled us as we walked out of our room. I would highly suggest to not live there, renters beware.

Awesome place, especially for a romantic occasion! My boyfriend and I went there last night for our anniversary and loved it, we were there when the sun was setting and also when it went down and it was absolutely breathtaking! We wanted an order of the scallops but they didn't have them, so we will try it next time! We did get the bacon burger as well as beef and it was awesome! We loved our server Jerry, she made it even better! We will be back soon! It's awesome!

Went there for my birthday today & I got the half rack of ribs & he got the beef brisket sandwich and it was everything we hoped for and more! Best macaroni and cheese and just everything! I wish I lived closer and could go there everyday! Definitely recommend going there!!!!

Oh my gosh I loved it! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time together and t was so good! I got the filet kabob with mashed potatoes and a baked potato and it was some of the best filet I had ever had and Steven had the 7 ounce filet mignon and he said it was absolutely perfect! We also had a glass of Seven Oaks Cabernet which was delicious and had a nice finish. We finished up with brownie and our server was awesome and we loved that it didn't cost and arm and a leg for s fancy dinner! Can't wait to go back and bring the family here!

Absolutely love this place! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time because we read about it in a magazine and fell in love! We took both of our parents here when we moved here and they loved it! The place is always busy, the staff is so friendly & funny, and the food is absolutely perfect! We will definitely be back!

Went here tonight for the boyfriends birthday with friends and it was a good time. If it wasn't for the games I wouldn't go back. We ate some appetizers and shared some entrees at there restaurant and the blonde hostess was very rude. My friend and I stood there while she was looking down for about 5 minutes before I said hello and than she threw the menus down when we were seated and said here. The food did come out vey quick which was nice but it wasn't anything special it just was good to balance out the alcohol. Overall we will definitely eat elsewhere before we go there again but there games are great!

I've been here a few times and it's pretty good! I would HIGHLY recommend there starter beer pretzel, it's the BEST pretzel you will ever eat in your entire life and the beer cheese is AMAZING! The first time I went there I got the street tacos & that didn't work to well they were very very spicy. Second time & third time I got the nachos and they were phenomenal but definitely a plate to share! Steven also got the Mac & cheese burger & it was very good just hard to eat. The reason I wouldn't rate this place a 5/5 is due to the service, every time we've been there it has taken a while for our drinks to get delivered & unnecessary played that are empty or done to be taken off our table for more room. But we will be aback again!

ABSOLUTELY NEVER GOING BACK! I've been here several times before and always rave about it to family and friends but never again. Waited for about 40ish minutes for a outside table with my fianc√© and dog and than was told I couldn't stay because I wasn't 21 even though he was. Mind you I turn 21 soon & was there to enjoy there food and atmosphere, THAT WAS IT. Than was told that if I wanted to stay as an exception I had to be out within an hour no questions asked. We own a restaurant and I have never nor I wouldn't treat anyone the way we were treated. I have never been asked to show ID just to eat food at a restaurant. Highly suggest skip this & go to The Perch or Bj's.  (I would give 0 if that was an option)

I went to Buca for the first time with my boyfriend last night and I loved it, it was so good! We had an amazing server named Peter and he was such a great help for recommending good dishes to us! We started off with the garlic cheesy bread and it was so good, and had he delicious chopped antipasto salad, than went into our fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and that was so good, and of course we had to finish up with the cannoli for dessert which was amazing! Definitely very large portions but that makes it all the better because you get leftovers! Can't wait to go back again!

WHO DOESN'T LOVE SWEETIES FIRST OFF?!? If you are looking for a place with literally any style of candy and small amounts of candy or bulk amounts of candy than this is the place to go! We go there about every few months and love it!

My girlfriend and I went here for the very first time together this morning and it was good! She got the country style omelette which looked delicious and I got the two hot cakes which were good but nothing too special. The reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is because it was good but it wasn't anything to die about and I would like a little bit more of breakfast options on their menu.

We just moved to the area from Tempe and use to eat at Native a few times a week! We were pretty excited to have one pretty close, but after we went there we changed our minds. We ordered ToGo food for lunch, they said it would take about 10 minutes, we drove there and sat for another 10ish minutes. Waiter was very rude to me, no thank you or have a good day, she wanted her money that was it. When we got home my pork was hard to pull, the bread was stale, and my fries weren't fully cooked. My boyfriends wings were so hard to the point where we couldn't eat them & several were undressed. We are ashamed because we love this place, but we definitely will not return to this one.

My boyfriend and I love breakfast and were excited to try a new place! We went there for the 1st time and it was a very good experience, we had a great waitress, she got our drinks out right away & our food was out before we knew it & it was great! The past two times we went we haven't been happy. We went today & had a younger gentleman as our waiter, we ordered coffee & chocolate milk and it took about 10 minutes to bring our drinks. We were so upset we were packing up our things to leave right as he came with the drinks. Our food was out pretty quick after we ordered, my bacon wasn't cooked all the way through, our eggs weren't good & kind of hard. Unfortunately we thought maybe we'd give it another shot, but after this we won't be back.

Went here with the fambam and we LOVED it! One person had been there before & the other 3 and a half haven't been yet, but we will definitely be back! We loved the special with the burger that day! Two of us got burgers, one got the wrap, and I got two appetizers, & the baby got a hot dog and everything was so good and came out so quick! They had the salad out first along with the baby food! We would definitely recommend it & will be back soon!

Absolutely loved this place! We looked up places to eat and this came up and we are very glad we went! My boyfriend got the Ham Scramble which was awesome and I got the Cinnamon French Toast combo and it was great! The service was great, the restaurant was also kept very clean, and everyone seemed to have a smile on their face and looked like they enjoyed working there! I would defiantly try it, we'll be back!

We eat here all the time because it's an amazing place to eat and the atmosphere is wonderful! My boyfriend and I each got our own personal 10' pizzas and they were amazing! I got the mighty meat with extra bacon and loved it and he got the buffalo chicken and it was so good! Can't wait to go back again!

OH MY GOD I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We discovered this place through Yelp & are so glad we did! We first went there on a weeknight and loved the birds and the ambiance that it put off. We first tried there hummus platter which is so good, another time there sausage platter which is very good, and than we tried there cheese and meat board which is a bit expensive for my liking but it's oh so good! I always get there pork sliders because they are to good to be true and my boyfriend first got the French dip which is awesome but now he creates his lobster Mac & I don't even like lobster but there lobster Mac is to die for! I can't wait to go back soon!!!

Went here for the first time with the three of us! We saw a commercial on tv and were so excited! We drove from Ahwatukee, so it took us a while and we passed it a few times before finding it! It was crowded so we had to wait for a seat to open up! We got three coffees there and they were awfully strong (we like ours a little more sweet) and we each ordered some food. There food was awesome! The one thing I didn't like was how long it took for it to come out and than when it did my burrito took an extra 8ish minutes by itself. Other than that I'll remember this place if I'm ever in the area! Best of luck to the owners!

For what it is I would give it a 5! Stopped here early this morning before our flight took off and it was nice. I got there French toast breakfast which was good but the French toast was a little under cooked for me, it was soggy when it came out & than with the syrup on it, it made it a little worse. My boyfriend got the Brewers Breakfast was really good and we both LOVED it & the bacon! We hope to go to the actual restaurant when we get back from vacation, ambit will also keep this one in mind when we fly again!

Will never go back there again even if I am starving. Went here twice both a few months apart and wasn't pleased what so ever. The first time we went the food was okay and the service sucked. Second time we went the service was okay and the food was absolutely disgusting. We got the f eh and chips and my boyfriend actually threw up in the parking lot on our way out and spent the next two days at home sick along with me. Our server dropped the check off when he dropped our food off and we never saw him again or a manager to complain & it has to be bad for us to complain. Really sad because we wanted to like it.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been here three times now with the boyfriend and family and everyone loves it! They have a great beer selection and the service is always good, the waiters aren't in your face too much or not enough it's the perfect amount & of course the atmosphere is great too! Highly recommend the Sonoran Dog, it's presentation is on point and super filling! I've gotten both their tacos and shredded beef burrito (fully loaded) and never been disappointed! Would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!

We read lots of reviews on Pomo Pizzeria and finally decided to go to this one instead of in Phoenix and we loved it! We order the Don Alfonso pizza and it was great, and the olive oil added a nice touch! I would've given it a five, but unfortunately we had a very odd waiter. He was older with brown hair and wasn't helping us with picking a pizza, he would only drop one thing off and race away to do nothing but stand, and wasn't very polite. We will go back again but probably to the downtown Phoenix site.

OH MY GOSH DID WE LOVE IT! We live right down the road and this was such a bad decision for us to make because now we are going to become poor because we will be here everyday! I got the Bears Choice with pancakes and bacon and it was delicious and Steven got the Country fried steak which was delicious! Don't forget to get there orange juice it's amazing! We can't wait to go back! Excellent service as well!

Literally go here twice a week and that's so bad, but it is so good! I absolutely LOVE the chunky French toast and there delicious syrup and you can't go wrong with adding bacon or sausage! Steven always switches it up with different croissant sandwiches and even a sandwhich in general and we love them! Can't wait to go this week! Yay!
