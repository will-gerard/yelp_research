I like the no fee checking they offer which no other bank in Phoenix offered me. No minimum balance to maintain. I find them very friendly efficient and professional. If they would just add the ability to deposit checks by smart phone pics I would give a 5 star rating.

Rito's! U guys rock! U like Mexican food? Then this is the authentic place in Phoenix that you will come back to over and over again. Now if they just had a shaded seating area with misters it would be a 5 star rating in my book.

Great service fair prices. This is the location that still has the old woodwork and marble top tables. I hear the rest of the good egg places have updated innards. I though am a fan of this old style. Plenty of parking as aj' fine foods grocery is here too. Just a block away from the light rail station at central/camelback.

I'm so happy to have my grandson and my son and daughter in law living here. We all love the shaded property which is so hard to find in the desert valley of Phoenix. The staff is very friendly and attentive to detail. Thanks for being an oasis in the driest state we have ever lived in!

Neat clean friendly and efficient. Could use more electrical outlets. Good food selections but $$$ prices. Sky train to the lightrail to downtown works perfectly. No need to pay for parking.

Jon is authentic, honest, professional and excellent at his trade. I have had him tint the windows in 3 of my vehicles over the past 5 years and in my sons car also. Excellent person to work with in my experience. Thanks again Jon!

Ok ... Good tasting meatballs, average salad ... nice to have 5 veggie mix in the rice along with some scrambled eggs but way too much black pepper IMO ... was it worth 10 bucks for a special with a cup of hot tea? ... a bit high

Excellent at what they do. If they were open for allergy shots on Saturday it would get a 5* rating.

I live downtown Phx and absolutely love the community street parties here, local art shows, organic market food and the list goes on. Great to have this as part of the neighborhood! If I ever had a need to stay in the rooms I'm sure I would give it a 5 star rating. Well done!!

Had to write to tell everyone of our superb dining experience at Kincaid's in Phoenix on June 15,2012  We reside within blocks of this restaurant and decided to make a party of five dinner reservation. Everything was above our expectations including our server, Drew M.   Starting with the bread that was served which we wished we could obtain the recipe for, to the salads and on to the main courses everything and I mean every detail was wonderful. My wife and I eat out almost every day and our guests that evening have dined around the globe and we could not think of a better meal that we have had in recent memory. I come from a very German background and had never had better red cabbage than what was served to me that evening along with the Kobe meatloaf. Our guests all loved their steaks and seafood choices and we topped off the dinner with Key Lime pie.   Congratulations on excellence in fine dining presentation. We will return!     Jim S.

Grumpy Ranger Mike Garcia sets an unwelcome tone. Sorry to have disturbed his day by visiting. As a public face of such a great site it soured the visit from the very start. The movie was OK the ruins were OK but hey put a better people person as your front register guy.

OK I am fully sold on this place in every way! As a recent transplant from Ohio I am completely taken by every aspect of this gem of a market! Staff is friendly and informative of not just what is sold here and what activities they sponsor but also what is going on in the downtown Phoenix area and the arts districts happenings. A very community minded feel as well as the greatest healthy food selections is what you will find here. 5 stars!!!!!

My wife and I have lived here over a year now and I have had a fantastic year here. We plan on staying past our 15 month lease date for sure. The staff is friendly, hard working and responsive to every need we have had. Maintenance crew is awesome! If I were to buy a house with all the amenities we have here I could never afford it. Let me list a few ... 2 pools, a hot tub, 2 outdoor gas grills, a workout room, a pool table game room, a clubhouse room with bar area and big screen TV, covered parking for me and any guests I might entertain, valet garbage and recycling pickup at my doorstep, a front great room with a nice fireplace, outdoor fountains and beautiful landscaping and a locked gated entrance. Oh yes and also a full time staff to keep up the property both inside and out. No need to worry about replacing a roof or even appliances in the future when they wear out. Oh and lets throw in a fresh coat of paint for the entire exterior just for fun eh? :) Yes I have owned several properties in my day and still do own a condo in Ohio so I know and appreciate all that goes into home ownership and I have no desire to return to it anytime soon. Thanks again to all who make Camden Copper Square a great place to live.   P.S. I have used the free wifi often and love the cable provided too. No worries listing and selling on Craigslist when you can meet any perspective buyers in the front great room and they don't have to come into your apartment. Yes indeed it is very well worth the price of monthly rent. Not to mention the close proximity to everything from art and science centers to pro ball teams and great restaurants ... I guess I could go on and on eh? ;)

My wife and I are planning to move from the northside/Desert Ridge area to Downtown Phoenix and this is exactly what we love about downtown! Awesome place to enjoy life! Music, food, fountains, festivities, architecture, pedalcabs, street vendors, art and the fine people we meet every time we come here. We love Phoenix and CityScape!

Updated experience as we now live in the Cityscape Residences above the Hotel Palomar. We love stepping outside right into the middle of our city. We sold one car and ride our bikes, hop on the lightrail or walk to wherever we are going.

Great diner, great food, great friendly service. Love a place that gives you your own coffee pot. Everything was hot and tasty. Only reason for not 5 star rating was the bitter tasting coffee. Arbuckles coffee from Tucson would be my suggestion for superior smooth tasting coffee. I noticed others on yelp said the same thing about the harsh taste. Yes I do plan on revisiting soon. I will just pass on the cup o joe. They did win the best eating place award in their neighborhood this past week and well deserved in my opinion.

Went on line and got a price quote. Called them up and found them to be professional and they gave me a cheaper rate than I was quoted. Made the appointment over the phone and the next day they showed up on time. Professional, courteous and fast. They got my cracked windshield out and new one installed in less than 25 minutes. Excellent service with even a lifetime warranty for stone chips. Five star company in every way.

The ambassadors are an awesome community resource for all who live, work and visit downtown Phoenix. They are here to help facilitate the experience of all. Stop by their visitors information center on Adams St between Central and 1st Ave. They have their finger on the pulse of what's happening every day!

Been here 4 times. Only got in 2 times  Posted hours mean nothing. They close when business is slow. First meal they forgot to bring the bread with my meal. Had to ask for it. It came cold. Second time I got there 2 hours befor posted closing time. Bone fragment in my meat sauce. Could not order anything else because they shut down the registers after I had placed my order. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Based on 2 breakfast visits I must say that I am a fan! Great coffee delicious omelets and fresh salads. Love the outdoor shaded patio. Only improvement I see is that the bike racks need lower loops down the post to accommodate using u-locks for shorter bikes like my Brompton and my wife's folding bike.

What's not to love about the best service and biggest selection of all brands of folding bikes in Arizona? Love it! I bought my Brompton almost a year ago and just yesterday my wife Tammy bought her minimalist dream, a Carry-Me bike! Owners Al and Donna are the best. Thanks for the great continued professional service!

Vintage apartments completely remodeled. Covered parking, gated access, new pool, friendly neighborly vibe. Inside we like the polished smooth concrete floors that show the character of the years gone by. Stainless steel appliances and great countertops. Juan the maintenance guy who lives on the property is fantastic. A good place to call home in downtown Phoenix Az. PS. Have to mention after 1 year of living here we are now dealing with strong 2nd hand smoke coming from the apartment above. This smoke comes in through the ventilation system. My wife has asthma and can no longer stay here. Guess we will have to move on.

What's not to love living here?! The center of downtown Phoenix with great views of our valley from every direction. Quality construction throughout and friendly staff to assist you in whatever you need. The non smoking building policy was exactly what my wife needed as she has asthma. We have owned many homes and have no desire to own any more. Thanks for providing such a great place to call home.   Updated thoughts/concerns after living here a couple of years now. Although we are a non smoking building, we are frustrated that the policy is broken often by residents which aggravates my wife's asthma. Second hand smoke comes into our apartment when the air conditioning kicks on. Maybe it's time to leave?
