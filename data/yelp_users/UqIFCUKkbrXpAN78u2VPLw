This place really isn't half bad.  I have heard a mixture of reviews about it from my friends, but they roped me in with the enticing $3 beer specials.   Though it appears small from the outside, the Vine is quite spacious and definitely capable of providing libations and entertainment to the masses in a quick and satisfactory way.   I decided to venture out here for a co-worker's birthday and was tickled pink that karaoke was about to go down. Cheap drinks, masses of people, and karaoke? What more  could you possibly want on a Thursday night?  The service and selection here is quite favorable. In fact, I'm pretty pumped that The Vine was clean and well lit.  Most bars i've been to have provided quite the opposite experience.   Overall, there is definitely room for improvement... but nothing that will seriously keep me from soaking up all that is has to offer in the next few days. Chug on my friends. Chug on.

The ambiance of this nightclub is quite unique. I mean, rooftop party, in vegas? Seems normal... but VooDoo takes it just a slight step further...  The music is surprisingly good and the drinks are top of the line. Some of which are served in glasses that require two-hands, and an IG photo for extra awesome-ness. (Dry ice drinks?! SAY WHAT?!)   The prices aren't bad, and the space isn't as limited as I had heard it could be. In fact, it's actually a pleasant backdrop for a not-so-crazy, yet still amazingly fun Vegas experience. The staff is well trained in off-the-wall drinks and of course the traditional poisons... but even their flair is actually quite entertaining.   CLEANLINESS: Average. It's dark, and you cold only see so much...but it seemed fine overall.  DRINKS: Unique and traditional drinks served, and prices aren't extreme.  SERVICE: Give and take. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good... and the average wait time for a drink wasn't unbearable either.   LOCATION: A prime off-the-strip location, @ the RIO.   I have VIP passes for the next time I visit, allowing me to avoid lines and access certain areas of the club that others cannot.. but even if I didn't have all that, I'd still go back.

This place is pretty amazing. It is equipped with plenty of tailgating space and has so many beautiful surroundings. Being at Spring training just couldn't get any better.   The complex is spacious and the staff is always  friendly well organized. Once you enter, there are numerous vendors of all shapes and sizes to explore. While I didn't try anything, I can guarantee that a few places smelled too delicious to pass up next time i'm around!   The grass area is beautifully green but also quite warm, so be equipped with a beach towel / blanket and some sun screen if this is your route of view. As a complex wanderer, I can honestly tell you that all seats in the house are the best. You can see well from all areas and the access to players is great for fans of all ages.  Overall, the location is ideal, being that is conveniently located by many other restaurants and bars. And parking is only $5. So you can't complain. It is beautiful, welcoming and filled to the brim with interesting characters that make the experience that much more fun. Rumor has it, Rick Flair frequents the area... so keep an eye out!

So, i'm not much of a coffee drinker... Or better yet, I wasn't until recently.   But even still, if I was a coffee fiend looking for a break, the variety of drinks here is basically never-ending; that is of course, depending on your own imagination.   Every time i've visited Dutch Bros, I have always been given service with a smile and my drink was delivered with the utmost of haste. (As a teacher on the go, this is super convenient!) Did I mention, this location is open 24 hours? Talk about too legit to quit.  I can always taste the difference in quality of coffee from one shop to the next...mostly because I don't drink it often... so I must say... this here... this is the good stuff. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get their coffee fix quickly, and still maintain quality.  I'd also like to give a shout out to the young man who was at the window the other day... His name is Cougar and he is quite the worker bee.... He is a great example of what customer service SHOULD be! It's people like Cougar that make me want to come back time and time again... (especially at this location!)

Good food. Decent Prices. Great customer Service. What more can you really ask for?   While the location and parking situation may not be ideal for this place, it was not enough to discourage me from taking part in all the wonderful food that Thai Basil had to offer.  From curry to tofu pad thai, your options are only limited by your imagination. I visited this location with a couple of friends and was enamored by the variety of flavors and pairings that were offered. The duck with red curry was absolutely phenomenal. So was the panang curry and pad thai. You can completely customize your order with a protein of your choice (tofu, chicken, beef) and a varied level of spice (medium is spicier than I thought it would be! be careful!)   With every bite I could taste the crisp freshness of every ingredient and flavorful sauces to boot. The portions here are large so if you aren't supremely hungry upon entry, you are sure to go home with some left overs.  The food came out quick and was amazingly flavorful. I can't wait to try some other things off of this amazing menu the next time i'm in town!

Oh my god, MOUTHGASM.   That is literally the best description I can give in regards to the flavors that tickled my taste buds once I took my first bite of a Habit Burger.  The meats are so juicy, and the veggies are so fresh, I can't believe I've ever settled for less, before. The fries are just the right amount of crispy and flavorful, without the overdose of salt. I honestly just couldn't get enough.   My favorite part of this place is the ability I have to customize just about anything on the menu. On my last visit, 2/16/15, I ordered a veggie patty with swiss cheese and a side of fries. I'm not even a vegetarian, but DANG! That was one tasty veggie burger!! In addition to what is prepared behind the counter, many of the condiments and "side offerings" on the flip side are equally as wonderful in flavor and variety.   To top it all off, the customer service here was great! The man who took my order was all smiles, very welcoming, and friendly.   While this place is a bit on the pricier side of the spectrum, you ultimately get what you pay for.... and that's just pure bliss.

i'm not one to go get my nails or toes done on a regular basis... but when I do, I definitely care about quality.  Being that i'm away from home and was in desperate need of a pedicure fix, I took to the streets. Stumbling upon this place was the best accident ever.  The staff here is friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Not only did I receive what I dare to call the best foot message EVER, but also pertinent information about my nail health. At first I felt embarrassed for not knowing anything about what the young man was talking about, but afterwards, I was pleased to be enlightened.   Conveniently located across the street from ASU and inside of P!nk's Salon, this place is the mecca of artistic expression. From the decor to the nail designs, your imagination can run wild here.   Best piece of advice for YOUR visit: Call ahead. They book up FAST. Also, be sure to specify what services you want to be done, otherwise you will end up with something you didn't intend to. ***I asked for a pedicure, and I got one... but I wanted to upgrade from the basic to a more expensive / thorough treatment, but was never asked if that was something I wanted. Kinda bummed out, but still satisfied.***

So my boyfriend and I ventured here for some prime time World Cup viewing as well as  some delicious noms (or food, if you will).  First thing's first. This place has the coolest atmosphere  ever (As far as restaurants go). Complete with laid back tunage and retro decor, I was instantly enamored. The smell that emerges from the kitchen is also to die for. Did I mention that they have a weekend happy hour that includes alcoholic agua frescas as well as local pitchers of beer? My goodness... could it get any better...  The food options are plentiful and everything is extremely fresh. I can't even begin to describe to you the wonderful appeal to the senses that each bite provides. My boyfriend ordered a make your own type of burrito and I ordered the chicken.  (Which sounds plain and boring but is anything but!) Inside the chicken burrito was butternut and chayote squash, spinach, mushroom, avocado, corn, queso, tomatillo salsa, pico gringo and aji amarillo. (i'm salivating just remembering it!) I also washed it down with an ice cold glass of some Four Peaks....   Overall, if you aren't in the area, this place is worth the drive. Devine food, amazing customer service, and extreme satisfaction all around. I will DEFINITELY be coming back.

This place was a ---- show. Not very organized or clean and the staff was overtly and unnecessarily rude.   While I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there was no cover and the drink prices were decent, the negatives definitely outweighed the positives for me, here.   Though this place is quite large, it definitely didn't feel like it. If the bar and patio area was not at capacity, it had to be pretty darn close. I couldn't even lift up my arm to drink my beer because it was either close to being knocked out of my hand or even better, my arms were pinned against a number of sweaty strangers.The music choice was not the best and the layout is generally not friendly to people looking to wander and mingle.   If you don't enjoy being shoved into tiny or poorly lit corners and you dislike pop club remixes of songs, this is definitely not the scene for you. I suggest you get your kicks elsewhere.

Holy Moly. With the use of fresh local produce and even more delightfully seasoned proteins this place immediately had me enamored.  I ordered the balsamic grilled chicken panini, and from the moment it graced my tastebuds with its presence an instant wave of happiness and overall satisfaction truly over came me. I don't often have such an overwhelmingly delightful experience with food outside of my mother's kitchen, but this was a foodie experience worth noting.  However, at the time of my visit the place itself was quite barren, and I was surprised at the lack of presence made by the staff. Except for the time that our food was brought to the table, no one came to check up or ask any questions. I mean, Nothing was wrong, but sometimes it is nice to be asked so that we know as customers that we are valued and that the experience we have at that establishment actually matters.   In the end, the gourmet food options paired with an upscale interior feel made for an amazing overall experience. I look forward to visiting again the next time I am in town.
