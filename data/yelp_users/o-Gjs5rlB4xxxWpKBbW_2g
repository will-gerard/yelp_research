Hands down best restaurant in Arizona! My boyfriend and I went with the short story dining experience. Every course was perfection and the service was incredible. 5 STARS

Upon arrival we were upgraded to the gold suites and I could not ask for a better experience. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was spacious, clean, and even included a balcony and huge spa-like bathroom. This morning the gold lounge provided a wide variety of delicious breakfast options as well as desserts and drinks in the evening. The rooftop spa pool was the perfect place to relax and the eucalyptus steam room was incredible. I would highly recommend their restaurant Toro and the pools had great dining options as well. I cannot wait to come back this summer!

I used to love this place :( just waited 25 minutes in the drive thru. Won't be back.

I was so disappointed after seeing many great reviews. I was told to take a seat, then completely ignored and ended up leaving before placing an order. Unfortunately the avocado curry was not worth the poor service.
