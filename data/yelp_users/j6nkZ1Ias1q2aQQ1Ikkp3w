I LOVE THIS PLACE! By far the best tomato soup EVER! The service is awesome, very nice owners. The hummus is great. I come here as often as I can. Good atmosphere and great food. 5 thumbs up for me!

I thought it was okay. The happy hour specials were awesome. I recommend it by far for happy hour. For me I thought the food was okay. I don't think it's really traditional Mexican food. I was very unimpressed.

Just about everything has a happy hr. price and the sushi is good. I came here with my best Friend and we enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Of course we came for the happy hour, the happy hour deals are great! we ordered a heart attack roll, spider roll and the sashimi albacore tuna! All REALLY good rolls, we also ordered edamame, a BIG bowl of miso soup and two Saki Bombers, all for around $25 dollars on happy hour! It was inexpensive and GOOD food! Even off happy hour they are reasonably priced! I will return again! Definitely recommended!

Excellent food, and reasonably priced. The service, on the other hand, was on the slow and inattentive side. We ordered the hummus, It was really good, it's not like the hummus you get at most places where it taste like they took it straight out of the container that they got from a  Sam's Club, it was actually really good, it had a garlic spicy taste to it. I also ordered the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich. It is by far one of my MOST favorite Chicken Sandwiches I have ever eaten! It was REALLY good. My fiancee ordered a Hamburger not sure which one it was but it was delicious, he got the sweet potato fries with it and they were AMAZING as well, they had cinnamon and sugar on them! I would return and HIGHLY recommend it! I would Maybe suggest that they hire a more attentive staff. That for me would make it a 5 star rating!

I adore this place, I'm a BIG fan! I have been here 3 times and I have only known about it 3 months! This place is classy and clean! The first time I was there me and my Fiancee sat at the bar ( Which was a gorgeous well stocked bar) we had lunch we both got chicken sandwiches OMG Delicious!  They have the BEST desert! We are big Fans of bread pudding so we got the white chocolate bread pudding! OMG wow! Very good! We were very impressed. The cost for that was like $30.00 it was quite cheap! We received WONDERFUL service. The next time we went was on a Friday evening and we were celebrating my new employment. They had a date night menu which we decided to order off of. The date night menu Included appetizers, two salad, two entrees  and a desert. it also included a drink, or for a little more a bottle of wine. We got the spinach artichoke dip, which was good, we got there WCG salad OMG so good! I had got the prime rib and my fiancee the rotisserie chicken and ribs... All of it was delicious! Then finally desert we did the white chocolate bread pudding becuase it was so good last time! The price was good we spent $58.00 plus tip so it was fairly inexpensive considering all we got. Again Great service and  GOOD food! The last time i went i went with my sister. She loved it, we got the WCG salad and shared a chicken sandwich all oh so good! This time I switched up the desert. We got the white chocolate brownie! oh my it was tasty! I will definitely return! Every time I go good food, great service and its a cool and clean place!

Meh. It's a cupcake. This was the first place I tried sprinkles..they were good but not OMG the best cupcakes I have had. I tried them in California and they were much better! The ones here are very dry! If I get Sprinkles it will have to be in California. I recommend "Nothing Bundt Cakes" Now that is a moist melt in your mouth OMG cake! lol I don't like waiting in the crazy lines for on "okay " Cup Cake! My dogs do love the doggie cup cakes that's a plus side! lol

I have heard so much hype about "Sprinkles" Cup Cakes, I mean don't get me wrong they are good, (better in California) but I work in the building behind Nothing Bundt Cakes they are  BY FAR better then "Sprinkles" Cup Cakes! "Sprinkles" Cup Cakes in Arizona are dry! These little bundt cakes are so moist and melt in your mouth. I honestly did not have to chew! I could just swallow! The taste  was oh so good! They come in unique flavors like pecan praline, white chocolate raspberry, almond poppyseed, red velvet, chocolate chocolate, white chocolate, lemon,  and marble etc.... They come in regular size, cupcake size, and bite size, they also have bigger cakes if needed. They can personalize the bundt cakes with balloons, flowers, or other cute decorative frills in the middle of the cake, which is then wrapped in cello and a nice ribbon. They are fairly inexpensive and worth a try.  There place is little and very cute, very inviting. They have Daily flavors you can sample. ;-)   Downside,  The lady who helped me seemed annoyed with me, and she was quite rude. She was rushing me to pick a flavor and seemed irritated with my questions. So I was VERY unhappy with the service I received. Will I go again,  absolutely ONLY becuase of the Bundt cakes were so GOOD. It would be a complete thumbs up for me I if I had received better service!

WORST customer service EVER. Extremely rude and VERY unorganized! Will NEVER return! It amazes me how a small business like this would treat customers as they did me and my sister, maybe it was becuase we were women. They told us a different story everyday, about an item we ordered. We finally received it 4 weeks later! When we were told the day we ordered it it would be in the next day!!!! Plus you walk in to the place and there is just stuff EVERYWHERE just clutter and not very appealing at all.

I enjoyed this place, I LOVE LOVE sushi and it was GREAT. There are numerous roll selections and they all looked very good. Each one we ordered was tasty, and of course when you go for sushi gotta have a saki bomber! Cant really go wrong with saki and sushi. It was a little on the pricey side. I would return and would recommend it. The place is set up nicely and is very traditional. I am always afraid of ordering desert at sushi places, becuase I have had some pretty bad experiences. We thought hey look they have a chocolate cake how bad can that be. So glad we did order it becuase it was SO YUMMY! Good place for sure. Will return. I just wish they had a better happy hour!

There are a few times in life when a meal is so expertly crafted and planned that's is nothing short of genius, today   Sammiches made one of thoes meals. I got the Tasty turkey with there house made pesto. It was phenomenonal. To top it off  Chef Jacob and Chef Troy were so very kind, it made the experience that much better. The food was fresh, the staff was amazing I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it.
