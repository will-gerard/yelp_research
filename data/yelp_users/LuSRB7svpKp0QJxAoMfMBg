My favorite taco spot, period.  I usually eat 7-8 (street) tacos in a sitting....the carnitas, carne asada, chicken are my favorites in that order.  Rice and beans finish the job nicely.  I brought a coworker from Costa Rica here.  He didn't like the food in ANY of the local restaurants I took him to because none of the meat had the great flavor he was used to...except for this place.  He was horking down 12-15 carne asada tacos in one sitting!  Insanity, but a testament to how good their food is.    Five stars, every time.

I usually don't like New Mexican food...but this spot is the exception.  Double-down on the warm, green chile salsa.  Put it on everything...you won't be sorry.  Chips/salsa are quite a bit more addicting than most places.  I usually get one of the combo platters as it has a bit of everything and all of them are excellent.  Finish up with a sopapilla (sugar preferred) and you just slammed a perfect meal.

Phenomenal lasagna!  Excellent bread!  This is my go-to place for Italian.  I wish I could  say that I've tried a lot of the menu, but I can't stop ordering the lasagna.  I did try the Baked Ziti, which is good, but it was cheese overload. Nothing wrong if that's your thing, but it was a bit cheese-heavy for me.  The waiter did warn me ahead of time of how cheesy it is, so I can't fault anyone.  I love the lasagna, though.  I don't know what they put in that tomato sauce but it's addictive.    I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants in AZ and this place is my favorite, hands down.

I would eat here everyday if I lived closer.  Excellent tacos!  Pastor, pollo, carne asada, carnitas....I get two of each every time I go.  I'm a pig.  I don't care.

Came here for two therapy sessions on my knee based upon a friend's recommendation.  Everyone here is nice and knowledgable...no issue with the therapists.  What I do have an issue with is the outrageous cost.  I had two one-hour sessions and a half hour initial consultation.  When I inquired about what it would cost me out of pocket, I was told between "$60-100" PER SESSION but they couldn't be sure because they use a 3rd party for billing.  Since I already had two back-to-back appointments scheduled, I went ahead with the appointments but was pensive about returning until I confirmed my bill.  Amount billed to my insurance: $1300 Out-of-pocket amount billed to me:  $300 (HSA, Blue Cross Blue Shield of AZ - deductible not yet met)  After the blinding rage subsided, I opted not to return.  Looked online to see what exercises I can do for self-therapy and, low and behold, they're the exact same ones I learned at my therapy sessions!  So essentially, my insurance and I paid $1300 for approximately 30 minutes of knee rubdown that felt good, but I could have got at a reflexologist for cheaper.  While part of this is the policy of the insurance company's coverage, I don't feel like I got even close to my money's worth for $520/hr.  Would not recommend due to cost.

Just moved into a new (previously-owned) house and the first order of business was to have the locks changed.  Jeff came out the same day, re-keyed 6 locks, and replaced a deadbolt during the time it took for me to eat lunch.  Awesome service and Jeff is now my go-to locksmith from here on out!

Stellar job by Doug installing a dog door in our new house!  He was right on time (actually a few minutes early) and knocked out the task in a little over 30 minutes.  Super clean job and when he was done, you couldn't tell he had just cut into the side of the house...all the debris was vacuumed up AND he provided the panels/insulation he removed in case we ever want to remove the dog door and patch them back in.  My dogs love it and we couldn't be more pleased with the results.  Thanks, Doug!

First things first....I'm a taco snob.  I've traveled all of the border towns from Tijuana to Juarez and have eaten a ton of legit tacos in each town.  I bought the 6 taco Groupon and gave this one a go.  The Good:  Lots of food for the money.  I had 6 tacos of varying types of meat and ended the afternoon legally stuffed.  Definitely a bit bigger than the standard street taco and the tortillas were double-wrapped.  The Bad:  My meal consisted of carne asada, chicken, regular carnitas, and Green Chile (pork).  Corn tortillas with pico, onion, cilantro, and mild green/red salsas.  All but the last one were flavorless.  Like boiled meats.  Like crockpot meat with no seasoning and too much water.  In fact, if you blindfolded me and told me to take a bite of each, it would have been difficult to discern which was which.  I was sorely disappointed.  The only half-decent savior was the Green Chile (pork) which was more spicy than flavorful.  Still, it was something after the five strikes before.  I'd love to recommend some EXCELLENT spots in Phoenix to the people who rate this 4-5 stars, but I realize that's not the point of this post. (You folks have no idea what you're missing, though!)  My recommendation to this restaurant:  Fix your meats.

Excellent job by Robert.  I had him clean the carpets in my house prior to an open house.  The comments from realtors were how good the original carpets in the 15 year old house looked.  He knocked out the job quickly and I have zero complaints about the job he did.  Thanks for the recommendations, Yelpers!!

Excellent ambiance, not so flavorful meats.  Definitely a place to go for happy hour, but not tacos.  And not the grilled corn.  No good.  Sorry guys.

I have to say, I didn't have high expectations for a build-your-own pizza place.  Seemed gimmicky...until I got there and saw all my options...  Excellent pie and unbelievably quick to the table!  Fresh ingredients, loved the crust, perfectly crispy thin crust.  The setup is kind of like Chipotle (assembly-line) and I like that you get to see what's going on your pizza as it's being assembled.  An 11" pie for $7.75...can't beat that!  Add to that a pizookie (oven baked cookie/ice cream) for dessert and you will be comfortably satisfied!
