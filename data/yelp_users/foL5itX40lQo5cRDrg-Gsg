Wow! This place was really amazing.  I made our reservation for a Saturday at 9PM for 8 guests but needed to change it to 9 guests. I called and spoke to Tariq, Owner/GM, and advised him of our addition.  He said that he would have to push our reservation back to 9:45PM, since the table he had for us could only seat 8 people. I was a little disappointed since I didn't want my guests to wait to eat so late, but hey its Vegas right!. Tariq told me that if he could accommodate us sooner he would text me and let me know (in my head I was thinking yeah right) Well at around 9PM Tariq text me and said come on down we are ready for you. (big kudos for the great customer service)  The restaurant is rather small but so intimate and inviting. The decor was beautiful and felt as if you were actually in Morocco. They start off with the traditional handwashing. Then brought out 3 heaping platefuls of Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi which was sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic, it was so good. (two of our guests were vegetarians and so they had sauteed mushrooms which they said was very good).  They then proceeded to serve us the soup and sampler which included  Hummus (garbanzo/tahini dip), Taktooka (Moroccan green pepper, tomato appetizer) Moroccan olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots  The Beef Kabob was so tender and flavorful (veggie kabob for the veg) and the main dish Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken were so delicious.  There was sooo much food and all of it was so tasty. Not to mention the fun exciting atmosphere with the belly dancers. We all got up and tried dancing a little. Overall a great great time.  Would highly recommend.
