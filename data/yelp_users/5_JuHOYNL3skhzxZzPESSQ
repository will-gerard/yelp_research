Met some friends here for a birthday dinner. Place was packed. I was drinking, but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails.  Three of us split a mixed grill plate. Had enough for four as opposed to three. We opted for carne asada, carnitas, and chicken. Everything was prepared well and was quite tasty.

Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great.   The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..  Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.

All the Mexican seafood favorites - shrimp cocktail, ceviche, fish tacos, etc... The shrimp in hot red sauce are fantastic! All around good stuff. Good selection of Mexican beers as well. I went for the 24 ounce Modelo. Reasonably priced as well.

The basics: nice atmosphere and good food, but a bit overpriced. Started out with the interesting cheese platter turns out that it is not $18 interesting. We then split a Roquefort salad. Quite tasty. We split two entrees - filet mignon and lamb shank. Filet was cooked well and sides were very good. Lamb shank was cooked well, but the sauce sucked. Dessert consisted of two tarts - Samoa and Four Berry. Four Berry was really good. Samoa was okay, but not great.  All in all the bill was close to $150 without a drop of liquor.   For that kind of money we/you could have two meals elsewhere.

Food was good, service was lousy. Started out with Edemame and Gyoza. Both were good. Had a mix of nigiri (yellowtail, tuna, salmon, and eel) plus some rolls. All were good.  Alas, food is only half the battle. The service was bad. The table next to us was left dirty for our entire meal. We started adding plates to the mess because our used plates were never picked up. Also, took about 20 minutes to get the check.   Not sure I would return.

Here is what you should have for lunch - Italian sausage with sweet peppers, hot peppers, and cheese. Throw in a order of fries plus a RC cola.   Love it.

Stellar! One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix. Sunday Happy Hour is rock solid - $5 small plates (many) and half price wine.   The menu covers everything you could want - steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, veggies, etc... I have eaten a wide variety of items and have never been disappointed.   You should stop reading this and go there. Pony up to the bar and enjoy yourself.

Pei Wei is adding a new concept to their lineup - "Pei Wei Asian Market". The menu has removed all the soups and most of the noodle dishes. Portions have been reduced and sandwiches have been added to the menu.   The good news - the decor and the layout are quite nice.   The bad news - I just really don't get it. It is like Pei Wei with a few odd items and higher prices. The portions and prices have been reduced, but seems to be more expensive. Also, they have removed the kids menu.

Dropped in for some dinner on a random Tuesday night. The place is nothing to write home about. It is located in a strip center with little ambiance.   That said, the pizza (whiteout) and the bread sticks that we ordered were very good. The pizza was a generously topped olive oil, basil, garlic, tomatoes, romano, mozzarella, and ricotta. The crust was toward the thin side, but crisp and good.   The bread sticks were definitely covered with olive oil and cheese. Some might think it was a bit greasy, but I was digging it.  Not sure, but I am guessing that the bulk of their business is delivery.   N*joy

Been here for lunch twice now. Small little place tucked into a larger center. Menu was different both times that I went here. That said, all the items that I had were delicious! Grilled veggie wrap, lavosh, spiced fruit salad with chicken, and spinach salad were all pretty darn tasty. Prices were reasonable and the service was top notch.  N*Joy...

When in Vegas - grab a cab and get to this place.. Located about a 10 minute cab ride off the main part of the Strip. It is on the 2nd floor of a non descript shopping mall. No extra points for curb appeal at this place.  First - the place was packed. We ended up waiting a few minutes, but it was full up.   Second - Big bottles of Asahi are $5.95. You should get a few of these.   Lastly - the menu crazy! It is on the menu, but it is also plastered to the walls on a ton of little signs. Ramen DX and Fried Pork with Kimchi were amazing.  Bonus - the place is open until 2am  N*joy.....

Why I don't set up a cot and just sleep at this place, I don't know. I have reviewed this place before, but I stopped in a couple times in the last month (yes, I should get my arteries checked).   Chicken = Fantastic, Mac & Cheese = Fantastic, and the Red Velvet Cake = To die for.  However, I wanted to add something I just had. Stupid Fries. These things are great for sharing. Cripsy fries, topped with a chopped up fried chicken breast, cheese, red and green bell peppers and gravy. They are off the hook good.   You should go there soon.

Lost the nut holding my front brake in place. Made a quick trip to Landis. The service was fast and friendly. They even had to cut the nut to size. In the end it only cost me a couple of bucks.  As a freebie, they adjusted my brakes.   Very good experience. Will return.

Not at all what I expected. Stopped in after work for a quick bite. Was expecting a small Mom and Pop type place with the basics. Discovered a modern, minimilistic restraurant. The menu is pretty diverse.   I went for Hot & Sour soup. A bit peppery for my tasty, but still worth a try. Chased it with stir fried veggies and noodles with veggies. Although, I did not order any meat dishes there were plenty on the menu.  The service was good and the food was good. Everything I asked for.

Much different experience than some of the recent reviews. Stopped in for dinner. Cuban joint down the street was closed. Started off with Angel Wings. It is deep fried stuff chicken wing with sweet chili sauce. Never had them before. Quite tasty. Three of them was too much for the two of us. Next moved on to soup. We went for the Gai Tohm Kahn. Sweet and sour chicken soup with coconut. Turned out to be pretty spicy. Good for me, I like spicy food. Finished off our dinner with Rad Nahn with chicken. Big,fat rice noodles with gravy. Not spicy, but still good.  The service was good, the prices were reasonable, and the food was tasty. Would return.

If you have to get your clothes cleaned for work, this is the place to go. Very reasonable prices for dry cleaning and laundry, next day service, and open pretty long hours.   Definitely spartan in decor, but that is not important to me in a dry cleaner.   I have been going here for years and they have always done a great job.

Had heard of Romanelli's, but was never on that side of town at the right time to check it out. This time it really worked out. We ordered two sandwiches - Meatball and The George. Both were on 10 inch hoagie rolls.   The meatball was piled high with meatballs, sauce, and cheese. The George was packed with meat and topped with sweet & hot peppers. The bread was fantastic. It was crusty, but not so hard that you could bite into it.  We split a cannoli for dessert. Crunchy and sweet.   I would highly recommend Romanelli's. Worth the trip.  N*joy...

Not sure why the rating is so low on this place. I stopped in for lunch the other day and it was delicious. Definitely not your typical American-Chinese restaurant. I shared three dishes with a colleague - Hot & Sour Soup, Handmade Shaanxi Noodles, and Shaanxi Noodles with Pork and Vegetables.   The soup was very good. I expected it to be spicier, but it was definitely a mild soup. Not the typical dark brownish Hot & Sour. The Handmade Noodles were excellent! Thick and tasty. Lots of spice in this dish.   Overall, I had a very enjoyable meal. Service was good, prices were reasonable, and food was tasty. Yea, the parking is less than optimal.   N*joy...

Not sure why, but Carlsbad seems to have fallen out of my rotation. Turns out I should put it back in. Stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday with a couple of friends. Service was good and the food was good.   We split green chili covered nachoes to start. Very good and a bit spicy. I had the carne adovada. It was less spicy than the nachos, but still good. The black beans were off the hook good. Spicy! Rice topped with cheese was good as well.  All in all, good joint. Well worth a stop.   CT, you are back in the rotation.

This place rocks! The bread is super tasty and the prices are very reasonable. I had a grilled pork baquette with mixed veggies. The pork had tons of flavor.   One note -  be sure to order double meat on the sandwiches. It only add $1 and is well worth it.  Cash only...

You like beef, chorizo, cheese, and eggs? Well, you can get all of them rolled into a single package at Sierra Bonita.   The SBG Signature burger is off the hook good. The classic tasty of a burger mixed with the distinctive flavor of chorizo. The fries were nice and crispy as well.  Vibe was good, portions were good, and the service was fast and friendly.   Check it out....

Really great experience at Harley's last night. We stopped in for a quick bit of Italian. We started with the Orangine di Patate. It is fried mash potatoes! Definitely a treat. Would get them over and over again. We then split a torched apricot salad. Again, just darn good. Mixed of fresh mozzarella, torched apricots, arugula, and prosciutto. We closed out our meal with spaghetti and meatballs. Simple, yet very well done.  I really enjoyed our meal. I would recommend a stop.  N*joy...

After tasting at several caterers, we decided to select Bruce Brown Catering for our wedding. This turned out to be an amazing choice! Between Susan and Bruce the service was outstanding. When we first tasted at their offices, we really enjoyed the food. However, we like things a bit spicy so we wanted to tweak a few things. Bruce was very helpful with recommendations and options. In the end, they came up with a menu that really reflected our tastes.   The day of the wedding, they were on time and absolutely professional. The set up was done in a very efficient manner, the food prep was inconspicuous, and the service was attentive. We had opted for a family style dinner with large plates to be passed around by all of our guests. Perhaps a bit unconventional, but it was handled with zero issues. The menu included smoked steak, pasta, chicken, and salad. All very incredibly tasty - especially the smoked steak!   The final praises came from our guests. They all said the food was amazing, original, and plentiful.   I can't recommend Bruce Brown enough. You will be in great hands with Susan and Bruce.  N*joy

You should be eating here more often.   One of my favorite spots to dine. Happy hour absolutely rocks! Here are just a few things that you should be eating when you go there: meatballs, flatbreads, fingerling potatoes, and baked goat cheese.   Quick tip: the upstairs always seems a bit hot to me. Might want to opt for sitting downstairs.

Dropped in for a quick lunch during the week. The place is no fancy, but it was darn good. Fairly crowded, but typical quick serve type place.   I opted for the falafel salad and a side of hummus. Turned out to be way more than I could eat. The falafel was really good. Some places tend to over cook it and it gets really dry. This was cooked to perfection. Also, came with a side of tahini sauce.   Would recommend.

Not too far from my office. Been here for lunch a few times now. All in all a pretty good spot. Quick and relatively cheap (for sushi).   They have a wide selection of items. All of which whisk by you on a conveyor belt. There are even some just plain funny items - cream puffs, jello pudding, canned fruit, etc..   Agree with some others that the service could be better. However, splitting checks is easy and I have never had a problem getting everything I asked for.   Have not been here for dinner so could be different.   The photos of tables with plates stacked up are pretty funny.

Hmm. The reviews seem to be all over place. My experience was very good. We arrived around 7pm. The place was really busy. We had to wait a bit for a table, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We decided to eat family style. We had a few different kinds of nigiri - albacore, salmon, spanish mackeral, etc... All were well portioned and tasted fresh. We completed the meal with a Lotus on Fire Roll and Hamachi Box Roll. The sauces that came with both of these rolls was excellent. A mix of sweet and spicy.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and I would return. Service was fast and friendly as well.   - Chris

Watched the Fiesta Bowl Parade today. Decided to stop at America's Taco Shop on the way home for a quick bite. Have to say that I was disappointed. The food had almost no flavor. The Carne Asada tasted like lime juice and the Al Pastor taco was overpowered by the mango.  I have definitely had better.

Stopped in to pick up a new pair of running shoes. Was not really sure what I wanted, but the staff was really, really helpful. Gave me a lot of options and explained the differences between all of them. Also, they did a gait analysis on my stride to help narrow the field of choices.   All in all, a great experience and I would highly recommend to others.

Stopped by this place on a lark. Never heard of it before and never seen the reviews on Yelp. It was around 2pm on a Saturday so the place was not crowded. The food was really fresh and really good.   We had guacamole, veggie burrito bowl, and chicken tacos. Everything appeared to be homemade and well seasoned. The service was fast and friendly. The mushrooms in the veggie bowl were fantastic. Not sure how they are prepared, but just a unique taste.  Menu is pretty straight forward and place is pretty small. I would definitely repeat.

True - they don't serve meat. True - the lunch buffet is reasonably priced and darn good. Have eaten here several times. Dishes change everytime I have been. Not a huge selection, but I left full and quite happy.  Noticed a bunch of comments on the service. My experience has been that the service is fine. I would not call it stunning, but it is lunch buffet after all. My needs were fairly low - water and some bread. The servers have always been helpful in explaining what everything is when I have asked.   N*joy

If you like wings, this is a great spot. Good choice of sauce and I love the fact that you can get the wings grilled after frying and covered in sauce again. A must have.   The burgers are good as well. Have not tried the other items. Beware the free peanuts, you can end up eating a ton of them.

Ok, I don't think that this will be spot that I go to all the time, but the Happy Hour is strong to very strong.   $5 dollar bar boards. You get to pick four items. I had two sliders, a deviled egg, and a grilled cheese thingy. They were all darn good.   Sitting outside is definitely a plus. Cool vibe and a great setting.

Saw the Grand Opening sign and decided to stop in. My meal consisted of a jerk chicken sandwich on white hamburger bun, an order of festivals (small cornbread type things), and juice drink (mango and pineapple juice mixed with simple syrup).   The jerk chicken sandwich was tasty, but really small. Not sure it was worth $5.25. The festivals were really dry. They could have used some sauce or gravy to go with them. The juice thingy was quite tasty.   In the end, I spent about $14 dollars and left hungry.   Did give feedback to the owner. Not sure if they will act on it.

Been here twice now. Think I have sampled a bit of everything. Tried three different kind of tacos (chicken, beef, and fish), a burro (carne asada), and a quesadilla (ground beef). Everything was really good.   The quesadilla is quite a bit different then other quesadillas I have had. Much thicker. More like a stuffed gordita. Was really good.  Small place. No wait was I was there, but I can easily see there being one. Salsa bar is fantastic.

Took a cab form the Cosmo over to The Quad. First things first - The Quad has been renovated, but still has a long way to go. That said, Hash House is fantastic. We arrived around 10am and the place was packed. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to eat.  In the end, it was well worth the wait. I opted for the veggie hash. It included sun dried tomatoes, potatoes, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. It was huge. Far more than I could eat. I did not order them, but tons of people got pancakes. They looked out of sights.  N*joy...

The food is fresh and well made, the atmosphere is okay, but reminiscent of a Scottsdale nightclub, and the prices are quite high. 3 rolls and 4 orders of nigiri was $96 with tax and tip. No drinks, just water.   Same food with better prices can be found elsewhere.  Side note - 10 minute wait with half the tables empty. WTH.

I have reviewed Richardson's before, but I wanted to give a quick update on Happy Hour. We came from seeing a play at Phoenix Theatre and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had always heard about the happy hour, but never caught it before.   Turns out that we were very lucky! During happy hour the small plates are $5, glasses of wine at $5, and draft beers at $5. This makes the place fairly reasonable. As for the food, we had Green Chili Sliders (outstanding), Carne Adovada Sliders (outstanding), Chicken Skewers (darn good), and Tostadas (crunchy and tasty). There are maybe 4 or 5 more things you can choose from.   The only hitch is you have to sit at the bar or in the cove (a closed in patio area). Small price to pay.  N*Joy...

Five stars for food and three stars for prices. I love the Ruebens (yes, they have multiple kinds of them)! I am not so much in love with the price tag. Rueben with drink, tax, and tip comes in around $15.   That said, I have eaten at Chompie's around 30 times. I really do like the service and the food. Would recommend for others.

Have been planning a trip to Peru for the spring. Decided to try some local Peruvian food to see what I was in store. Quite the pleseant surprise.   Started off with deep fried mash potatoes stuffed with ground beed and raisins. Not a texture that I am used to, but really good. Would definitely eat them again. Dinner was seared beef strips with rice and fried yucca. I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but included the word "saltado". The sauce has soy sauce in it. Really unique flavor. Again, I would definitely eat this dish again.  All in all, I would highly recommend. Not crowded, reasonably priced, and really good food.   Side note - The night I was there they were all out of roasted chicken. Kind of a disappointment because it was pretty cheap. $12 for a whole chicken plus fries.   Enjoy!

Hot dog, hot dog, hot digggity dog this place is tasty...  Had the Lava Dog Shaggy style and the Island Dog with hot sauce. So, so good. Who knew that coconut and bacon would taste good on a hot dog, but it sure does!  Two dogs (big) plus fries and a drink end up costing me about $12. Well worth it.

Stopped in for a quick plate of tacos. Had the Living Social deal so seemed worth a stop.  Menu is small, but contains a pretty good mix of tacos. Each plate has two tacos plus rice and beans. Chicken, pork, fish, and veggie were all availble in one form or another.  I opted for the chicken street tacos. Tasty, tender, thigh meat topped with veggies and cheese. Winner, winner chicken dinner in my book.  Would return and likely booze it up a bit as well. The changing colors on the bar were a bit funky, but place has a good vibe.

Quick update: Stopped by the past weekend. The claypot chili wings are top notch. Some of the best wings I have ever eaten. A solid choice.   Looks like a good addition to the Bethany Home & 16th St area. Really cool renovation of an old mechanic's shop. Slide up garage doors and fold up windows give the place a really open air feeling.   On to the food! The menu is pretty sparse, but covers the standard pub type fare. Salads, flatbreads (pizza), wings, burgers, etc...  We had an order of deviled eggs to start the night. Yea, never seen them on a menu before either. They were good, but a bit tame. They could be spiced up a bit for my taste. For dinner, I had a bacon cheeseburger. The bun was super tasty. Brioche bread and toasted a bit.   Beer and wine list was lengthy and reasonably priced.  I would return and would recommend.

An excellent choice for breakfast in the Valley. We stopped in for breakfast on Father's Day. We opted to share the Chicken in the Coop and Breakfast Enchiladas. Both of savory options topped with eggs. Really like both of them. They are very large portions and very well prepared.  N*Joy....

Stopped in for some late night munchies after catching Love at The Mirage. The decor and the ambiance is fantastic. Just a really comfy feel. The menu is small, but packed with lots of interesting stuff.   Be aware that everything is basically tapas. Small plates, but really good for sharing. We ended up with 5 items for two people. Roasted beets (excellent), bacon wrapped dates (divine),  grilled hanger steak with mashed potatoes (fantastic), flatbread (tasty) and some kind of chocolate mousse dessert (very tasty and rich).   All around good experience. Can be sneaky expensive if you are not paying attention to what you are ordering.   I would easily good back. Especially for late night dining.

Who is up for Cambodian food? Well, apparently, it was me and a couple of friends. Here comes the two parter:  First - The Location - It is actually a bit difficult to find. North side of Indian School between 12th St. and 16th St. Used to be Fellini's Pizza. Maybe Mexican food and/or hot dogs as well. Once inside, the place is nicely done. Very comfortable.   Second - The Food - Quite tasty. No insults intended, but it is best described as a less spicy version of Thai food. We all started out with fresh spring rolls. They contained shrimp, pork, rice, carrots, etc... Very well done and very good. One was plenty for me. I had Katheaw Cha. It is fried noodles with beef and broccoli. Again, very tasty. The two companions had crepes (looked more like a folded omelette) and noodle shop. Everything was really good.  I would go back and I would recommend.

Have been to Sweet Salvage a couple of times now. Yes, it gets crowded. Yes, some items are pricey. Who cares, the place is pretty darn cool. It is only open four days a month. Thursday thru Sunday. I would suggest getting there sooner rather than later.   It is definitely a more upscale place then some of the other vintage shops located on 7th Ave. Even so, it is worth a look  N*joy...

Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ.   It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty.  The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time.  Good joint. Would return.

Reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I must have eaten at a different restaurant. I order two spicy tuna rolls with brown rice. Both had zero flavor and could have been molded from Elmer's paste instead of fish.   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Seems like a good concept.

Undiscovered gem! This place is fantastic. The restaurant sits in a nondescript strip center on southwest corner of Indian School & 24th St. Since it was the first time we had been there I decided to try a bunch of different items and see what we liked.   Chicken Tikka Masala was rich and spicy. Very good.  Chicken Malai Boti was green (yea, green), grilled, and really flavorful. Vegetable Briyani was standard rice with veggies. Still good. Mantoo was the highlight! Little dumplings stuffed with meat. They are topped with a combination of curry and yogurt. So, so good...  You should definitely check this place out. The ambiance will not overwhelm you, but the food certainly will...

Hmm, the reviews for this place seem to be all over the place. My experience was all good.   Stopped in for late lunch on a Sunday. We kept it pretty straightforward. I had a Charr Burger with Cheddar Cheese. It was nicely cooked to medium rare. My girlfriend opted for the Chicken Grill. Both turned out to be good choices. The garlic knot bun for the burger is unique and buttery good. The meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but still had good flavor. The truffle fries were an excellent companion piece to the whole meal.  In the end, our waiter, Gino, was kind enough to give us some extra garlic knot buns to take home. Had a sandwich on one for dinner that night.  The burger world is the crowded spot these days, but Charr does have a home in it.

Quirkly good... Aligned with other reviews, it is similar to a Chipotle, but with enchiladas as the main fare. The ordering process is a bit clumsy, but the results are darn good.  I opted for a mix of veggies enchiladas - smashed potatoes, spinach, etc.. They are hand rolled and topped with the sauce of your choice. They add a few options - cheese, pico, etc.. that you can choose from.  The end result was top notch. Spicy, but not overpowering. Hot, but not so burning hot that I could not eat it immediately.   The chips was really good as well.  Stop in, piece together enchiladas your style, pop a squat and enjoy. I will be back....

Stopped in for Saturday lunch with my son. The place was fairly crowded. Although I think that there were more employees then there were customers.   That said, we share a couple of tacos, a burger, and some fries. All were good. The burger is very much in line with In & Out, Five Guys, or The Habit. Not like what you get a Deluxe or The Grind.   Nice decor, good service, and good food.

** Add another restaurant to the rotation **  Wow! Stopped in last night and was delighted. We decided to just share a bunch of stuff. We had guacamole and chips, steak tacos, pork tacos, bacon torta, goat tacos, roasted turnips, mexican style rice, and roasted beets. The guacamole was fresh and filled with citrus overtones. Very tasty. The roasted beets and turnips were all locally sourced. They were a mix of sweet and tart. Never really had anything like it. Darn good.   The prices were reasonable and the service was top notch. I would highly recommend a stop at Otro Cafe. I will be returning shortly and bringing some friends.

Had heard about this place from a few friends. Decided to give it a try. Overall, our experience was very good.  Started out with a couple of beers. We opted for, sorry can't remember the name, a fruit flavored summer brew. LIght, but refreshing. For dinner we split the fish and chips and an eggplant pizza. I think the fish and chips were better than the pizza, but both were good.  Overall, I was surprised at how nice the place is. Seems like this area needed a good place.

From the folks that brought you St. Francis. A quick Friday lunch was on the agenda. Public Market Cafe was new and seemed interesting.  Unlike St. Francis, you ordered at the counter and the food is brought out to you. The menu is interesting, but not overwhelming big. We opted for the Del Real Sandwich and the Roosevelt Row Bagel. Both were brought out promptly and done very well. The Del Real had a subtle sweetness to it. The bagel was a two different tastes. Guacamole on one side and hummus on the other.   The decor resembles that of St. Francis. A bit utilitarian and semi-industrial. That said, the place was comfortable. We did not check it out, but there is a bar you can sit at as well.

Four person rundown:  Grilled Veggies - lightly grilled veggies served with a side of seasoned olive oil. Very light and very well done  Caprese - fresh and light. Worth a try  Mango Salad - Citrus meets tart. Topped with creamy balsamic vinegar.   Shrimp Salad - A good bit of shrimp and a very nice dressing  Toto Sapore (meat pizza) - delectably crisp with just the right amount of toppings  Wonderful service and just an all around good experience. Will repeat.

Small, but tons of fun! unremarkable strip center with an unremarkable facade. However, what lies inside is quite good. A small place almost completely consumed by the bar itself.   Large selection of beer and wine. We sat near the front window. Chatted it up with a bunch of other patrons. You can't help not talking to people. Just a fantastic vibe in the place. Every so often a classic comes on the stereo and the whole bar starts singing along. Join in and have some fun. Try your hand at Rock'm/Sock'm Robots as well.   N*joy....

Dinner for 4 on a Saturday night. We got there a bit early and the place was starting to fill up. The decor and the ambiance are tip-top. The menu is very unique. An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings - Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well.   We had a mix of entrees. Scallop special (only 4 scallops, but well done), Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami (spicy and delectable), Kimchi Fried Rice (a bit salty, but well done), and the Roasted Pork Noodles (very tasty).   I think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there.   N*joy

Stopped in for bunch on a Saturday. The place is small, but cozy. The menu is small, but offers quite a bit of variety.  We decided to split a platter for two. It came with fried sweet potatoes, fried pork, and tamales. All were very good. The sweet potatoes on the bottom did get a bit salty. We also threw in a Peruvian version of torta. Unfortunately, I can't actually remember the name of it.   All in all, the place was excellent. Great service and great food. Definitely a winning combination.  N*joy...

The reviews seemed to be mixed, but my experience was quite good. Stopped in on Monday night for some grub. Place had some patrons, but not crowded.  Our server showed up promptly and was quite friendly. We started out with Queso Fundido. Their version of cheese dip. It was very good - spicy, but not overpoweringly so.  After that we moved on the obligatory taco plates. You choose either 3 street tacos or 2 gourmet tacos. There are other options, but that is the general gist of the place.  I opted for the 2 gourmet tacos. There is a pretty good selection of meat options and, if I remember correctly, a veggie one as well. I went for some meat options - 1 short rib and 1 shredded pork.  They were definitely juicy! Drippingly so.. That did not stop me from devouring both of them. The short rib was downright fantastic. Well flavored, generously portioned, and just the right amount of spice. The shredded pork was also very good.  In the end, I had a great meal at a good price.  N*joy.

Sadly, I will not be adding Paz to the list of restaurants that I frequent. We were on our way to Phoenix Theater to see a play. Decided to stop at Paz for dinner prior to the show. Luckily, we gave ourselves plenty of time.   The service was down right horrible. The hostess sat us at our table and we were basically ignored for 15 minutes. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. So, 30 minutes into this affair and we had managed to get some cocktails.  I would comment on the quality of the food or post photos of it, but sadly after almost 90 minutes mine had not arrived. Lucky me, it did arrive just as we were leaving. I took it to go and lovingly placed it in the trash can at home.  The owner was kind enough to comp out meal (or at the parts of it we got).   Without question, there are better places to find Mexican fare in Phoenix. I suggest you try them.  N*Joy...
