Great spot. I would def recommend this spot for comfort food. The fried chicken sandwich is not to be missed & the fries are amazing! Just ask for extra crispy. Can't wait to go back & try a burger they looked amazing!!!!

Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed.

Great service by Emily! Check in & u get $1 off a beer (nice!) ordered the Sun Up salad w/grilled chicken and it was very tasty. I just recommend they serve it in a bowl instead of a flat plate, it was kind of hard to eat. Hubby's fish & chips were great' he chose onion rings instead which were big Ol' amazingness.   Will be back!

Been here a handful of times throughout  the years.Last night was my most recent visit. I was in the mood for noodles something..we started off with the app of potstickers in an extremely spicy broth. Holy crap this is extremely spicy hence the name of the dish.   I ordered a beef udon dish with veggies and udon.. it was okay. husband had chicken parm. Shocker! prob wont be back for awhile spent $40 bux and had better at YC's Mongolian today : )

My gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a Sat. This place sucks! The bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol. Wont return again. It also smells like cigarette smoke from before they banned smoking in the bars. Gross! better dive bars to be had

So this is such an undercover type place it's where you go to hide and eat pretty darn good Italian food at a cheap ass price. My husband loves this no frills spot that has moved to the hotel from 7th ave a few years back. Where else are u going to get Veal parm for under $15? this is the spit for true Italian food at a cheap price. Definitely worth checking out. Had some split pea soup last night and it was very good. They have wings, salads, sandwiches and plates that come with salad or soup and bread.

I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal.

NASTY! Gordon Ramsay would have ripped this place apart. I'm imagining that's why there were only 6 people in this fairly large awkward restaurant on  a Friday night.  Completely outdated overpriced food. $26 for the grossest chicken Francese I have ever eaten. What a ripoff! Also their house wine is $10 a glass ( barefoot brand) will never return.

First time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time.

Best tucked away spot in Arcadia. I go there for the friendly bartenders, cool crowd and best wings in PHX. You need to order "The Works" wings (secret menu) Julio is the cook and he does a great job! You will find JT sitting at the bar usualyy drinking with the patrons. There's a juke box and great daily specials such as: 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesdays. A can't miss spot.

I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner. I was eating light this night so ordered a salad which said : field greens, apple, berry, fresh mozzarella, and I added chicken. This dish was an embarrassment to salads. Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice.   Husband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it.   This is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY. It is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by.

Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1/2 stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.

OMG. I have not been to this restaurant ion over 3 years and it was always good but never really think about it much. Tonight I visited and it received 5 stars for a number of reasons. The first foremost is the food is outstanding! we sat at the bar like we do at most places and weer quickly greeted by the giddy bartender. I ordered wine husband a lemon drop martini. The bartender made the lemon drop and added a splash of Rasp liqueur in at the end to make it "extra special. Quickly a hot basket of garlic bread arrived. Yay luv garlic bread. We ordered stuffed mushroom to start. Not my choice but hey they were good. It was so difficult deciding what to order due to their amazing menu. I finally decided on a shrimp fettuccine dish that was prepared with cognac, cream, wild mushrooms and shrimp. Orgasmic doesn't cover it. These were huge lump shrimp that tasted like lobster. By far one of the most memorable dishes I have eaten in years. Husband ordered Gnocchi. Wow amazing delicate covered in tomato cream sauce, made hrs before our arrival. The company of the staff mixed with the amazing authentic food bring me back to this place prob in the next week. I advise to to go this place for some amazing hands down top notch food.

Fucked up my order. Told me they would write me up in the book so I can get compensated with my correct order. Drove 15 miles there today to find out I wasn't in the book! The guy "Anthony" wasn't working so couldn't get compensated for my wrong order. Not a happy camper, someone better get in touch with me soon!

Holy crap! just tried this place out for the first time. I had a gift card for ten bux and decided to use it. This place is the shit! I am soo stuffed as I write this up.  You walk in and the bubbly hostess/mgr offered our assistance b/c we had no clue what to do. Very clean place. She walked me through the line to show us how to add the protein of your choice (freeze dried?) and all the veggies, noodles and she added my sauce concoction. I chose dark meat chix, chix breast, tofu and beef. For veggies onions, mushrooms, brocc, tofu, whole wheat noodles, rice noodles and whatever else I could pile on. Than I told her I like Sweet and hot sauces so she added mine on top. you swing to the cook and he takes your plate which at this point you can add pineapple, peanuts, cilantro. 4 min later walla food is done! you can go to the bar and get soup, crunchy Chinese wonton thingy's (the best) and a drink. Dessert is froyo!!!! all for $8. Go hungry and take home leftovers. I did!

Best French Fries in Phoenix  hands down. Order the Parmesean garlic fries and any burger on the menu and you won't be dissapointed.  Wed nights they run a $5 burger special for one of their burgers but you need to ask them about their special.    Cool Local/Ind resturant for wine and good food.

Just had my first sit down dinner here after carousing the bar once before. I can tell you that this place is cozy, comfortable like that broken-in feeling you get in an old couch. We dined at the bar b/c we don't like tables :) we started off with a crostini that was amazing!! beautifully played with salame, and olives.. I opted for duck with fig compote and smashed butternut squash and husband ordered the gnocchi. It  as wonderful. The dessert was the best part for me. Rice pudding/salted caramel sauce OMG OMG I cant wait to go back and have it again. The bartender makes prob some of the best hand crafted cocktails in the city. Dont miss out.

NY'ers Get in your car and head here as fast as you can. Chinese is my ultimate fave food. I tried this place after hearing about it 4 years ago and haven't stopped going since. Yes its a hike from Arcadia, but who cares. Order the peking duck, egg-rolls and whatever else looks good to you. I eat here most Valentine's and Xmas. PEKING DUCK i love you! owner is cool as hell too. make a reservation b/c this place is packed whenever you go.

Haven't dined here in way over a year until last night. Had a fabulous experience sitting at the bar.  Didn't catch the servers name but he was awesome! Had a bunch of sushi rolls on happy hour and shrimp with lobster sauce as an entree. Was very pleased. Definitely great Arcadia Chinese restaurant.

Stopped in for an impromptu dinner & honestly from service to food everything except one dish was 5-stars. I haven't dined at Chang's in a very long time & their HH menu is pretty solid. Chicken lettuce wraps ($6) glass of decent wine $6 (big pour) lot's to choose from. HH is M-F 4-7pm. If you want a classic. Old school flare & your in the neighborhood, I highly recommend  this location. Comfortable, friendly, efficient & professional.

Wanted something simple yet fulfilling & I chose to have dinner here tonight.  5 stars for service. Very hands on & friendly. 3.75 stars for overall food. 4.5 stars for value  Trout almondine was HUGE & really delicious. A definite keeper. I would have preferred a little less oil/butter for health reasons.  Prime Rib- great value!   Salad bar- included with meal. Very kitsch, old school feel. Basic; lettuce, onion, cucumber, tomato, olives, macaroni salad, coleslaw, beets   Lettuce a little watery/yet I helped myself to 2 servings.  Free potato skins with check-in on yelp and then he also (I think owner) brought us a chocolate dessert (a little icey) yet we devoured it.   I will definitely return here and get fish again.  Thanks for the awesome hospitality!

Pita Jungle was one the first places I ate when I moved here 14 years ago. It was right by ASU and delivered on those days I was too hungover to get out of bed which was a PLUS. Since then I have really enjoyed their grilled chix pitas, smoothies, and tsatziki. I was grateful they opened up an Arcadia location a few years ago..Whenver I want a consistemtly good chicken pita this is my goto spot. But as of late I have been attending their reverse happy hour which starts at 9 and goes till close which is around 10. They have a list of 10-15 tapas for $1-3 per item. I get the shrimp which comes with 2 ($3), plate of thyme and herb pita- 1 buck, trio of hummus 2 bux..u get the point. Its the healthy dollar menu!! check it out if u want a late night snack.

I have eaten here half a dozen times and I still can't decide if I like the chix pita better her or at pita jungle. I had dinner last night and ordered the chix pita. It didn't seem like the chix portion was as hefty as Pita Jungle's.  That would b my only complaint. The service is quick and friendly and they have a drive thru! I wouldn't recc you order from there and wait but you can pick your food up from the drive thru not leaving the car. Check this place out. They have great french fries, salads and pita sandwiches. A combo meal: drink, side and sand is 7.95

Great service this morning.   Looks like the menu has expanded since my last visit which was ages ago. Will be back soon.

I love this place! Stacey the tender is hit or miss on crankiness but Thurs are 2 for 1 drinks!! and there are always dollar jello shots. Cool bar but stay away if you are a homophobe. It is primarily a gay bar. Ive had many men buy me drinks here which is always a plus. Divey yet hip at the same time. Could use a wash down kinda sticky..no food just chips or beef jerkey u can buy for a cpl of bucks. Really good music.

I really like this place. I have been numerous amt of times and I keep wanting more. The friendly bartenders, the exciting chef  (Eddie). The best part of this place besides the good food and comfort level is their ALL Night Happy Hour. Yes All night $5 dollar specialty cocktails like an espresso martini or wines of the day. All first courses (apps) are half off too. The apps includes, lambchops ($19), Tuna tartar with wonton chips ($9) and so much more. Great s[ot and yearning for more since last night.

Since I am a happy hour junkie I rarely do sit down "fancy" meals. Husband was out of town and a friend had wanted to try Christopher's. being that is is in my backyard I never think to go here. I have done happy hr at Crush and his old place on the other side of the Biltmore but haven't had a sit-down here. Anyway it was so cozy at the bar where we sat. Friendly server and amazing menu. There is not one thing that didn't look appetizing on the menu. We started with the wild mushroom soup with foie gras and the escargot encroute. Both fantastic! for the main we shared the bone-in prime rib ($60) and a side of truffle frites ($8). To be honest the fries didn't taste like truffle to me?? and they r double fried so not a fave.   This spot is for me a special occasion place. Dinner would have been $200 with tip if we didn't have a restaurant.com cert. But needless to say with the discount its  a steal! I will be back to try dessert next time. We were so stuffed after a btl of wine and 2 glasses of bubbles. I also wanna try the burger on happy hour : )

Good service, great atmosphere. My only pet peeve is that my nail tech nicked my cuticle.,the sting sucks!!! I always have a fear when my gel polish is being removed Via nail file that they will file my cuticle area, yep it happened ugh! Other than that super friendly. I honestly don't think the service is worth $50 for a gel mani & would not of went if I didn't have a living social deal.

I'm embarrassed that I have only ate here two times and I live in very close proximity of this restaurant. Ate here tonight and it was perfection.  The server was so genuine & amazing! Lettuce wraps were delish along with the inside out quinoa burger. I was so impressed with start to finish. This is on my new rotating list of places to eat.

Stopped in here for drinks during "happy hour"  and there seems not to be one here. Not quite sure if they think they are too good for it. I dont mind spending $12 on a drink if its worth it but um...their drinks are 4 sips and $12. Their Margarita was blech too.. sorry Mission wont go back! didnt give it 1 star b/c the food looks promising.

First visit & I won't be back. HH food prices are overpriced in my opinion. $8 for 2 pieces of average bruschetta, no thank you ill goto Postino instead. Had a gift card they wouldn't accept on cocktails??? Who does that? It was a gift! Much better places to go & enjoy.

I have wanted to try this restaurant for over a year & tonight was the night. Great looking restaurant, nice bar, nice wine list.  Very attentive staff and meat was very good quality. I personally don't dine at buffets or all you can eat establishments so take this review in consideration.  I ate very little off the salad bar and definitely wouldn't come here for just that. It's great & all but why spend $30 at a salad bar? Make sure to eat the ribeye & filet. Don't waste your stomach space on chicken or pork or sirloin. IMHO. The little devilish bread biscuits you get are yum!   We were stuffed after this meal! Dessert was pretty good too.  I think one visit here is plenty. I prefer to spend my $ at a fine dining establishment with one steak versus 1o diff cuts per seating. Also, the sides could use some work.. No one really touched them.

Finally made my first visit here today for a gel mani. The reviews were spot on for this amazing salon. By far the best mani I have had in Phoenix. I had Demi as my nail tech and she was fab.  The little extra perk is they out sunscreen on your hands before they go under the light to protect you. I just thought that was super! Can't wait to go back in a couple of weeks again.  They also carry the Essie gel pool yah which is very rare.

Stayed here for 4 nights and the accommodations were over the top. Aveda bath products, sultry wood floors, amazing bar/restaurant in the lobby. I can go on and on. They were also nice enough to upgrade me to access the executive lounge for free breakfast in the morning; bacon, eggs, pastries, coffee and happy hour from 5:30-7 every night with complimentary wine, cheese, different apps every night such as orange chicken, potato chips & onion dip.  The staff was some of the most professional and sweetest people I have ever met!   They also welcome you with an alcoholic beverage and bite of a different app every night in the lobby. I stayed there for business and had catered lunch everyday along with muddle of the day snacks. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.

Been wanting to go here for awhile now but I'm not a huge fan of any Vietnamese I have ever tried. I went for it after all the good buzz about this place.  I ordered the spring rolls (fried) delish! and a Pho with meatball. I decided to order it to go but should have ate in. The soup is delish love all the condiments u add in..made mine super spicy. Had a iced Thai tea. very sweet and yummy but prob opt for the coffee next time. They sell coconuts for $2!!! i am so getting one next time. I look forward to going back again.

Just had my first pedi here due to the ratings on Yelp! Great pedi ($22) for the reg spa pedi. Other pedi's avail for $25 and up. Had the owner Lea and she is a relexologist, facialist etc.. amazing foot massage. This will be my new goto place. The only reason it didint get 5 starst is the choice of colors are not current.  Bring your fave color with you if your picky like me : )

I feel bad giving this 2 stars but I'm basing it on other burger joints in the area. I recently Had a fab experience at Zinburger so this is why they are only getting 2 stars. Sat at the bar and ordered the cowboy Burger and adult choc milkshake ($14) pretty pricey and tasted just like a reg choc shake?? The burger bun on the bottom was extremely mushy and was not eaten. Overall I just have had better. All the burgers are $16, luckily we said "happy birthday" which is a deal thru today May 4th 3-6 PM that makes one burger free. Prob wont go back.

This place is in walking distance from my house and they had a smartshooper deal for 50% off a month ago. I was in like Flynn. Had Cassandra who I must say might be the best waxer I have encountered in Phoenix. She also does nails at their sister etablishment Suddenly Slimmer.  I have been here twice for waxing services and it has been very good and competitive in price. Cassandra is only at Suddenly Slimmer now : ( for a lil extra I would try her out.

Ordered my first garage door for business and I must say they are by far the best deal around. I called multiple vendors and they were by far the least expensive by a few hundred dollars. Corey was very professional as well. Try them!

The best service I have received from a local restauarant in a LONG time. Greeted at the door and qucikly you can feel the positive vibe circling the room. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and a palmaire cocktail (awesome), Hubby had a painkiller and mini grilled cheese with side of tomato red pepper soup. You get a hot fresh bread basket along side of honey butter. TO DIE! definately worth another visit even if it's for drinks and dessert.

My husband decided to surprise me and take me here a few months back. I wasn't surprised because I bought  a restaurant.com coupon a few hrs earlier without him noticing. I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us. Anyway we walked in and sat at the bar. Very cute modern rest. friendly bartender and I believe I saw the owner as well. We orderd springrolls. chix pad thai dish, pork dish. All exceptionally good. A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer. It's kinda like a PF changs style but thai. I was enticed by this place and bought 2 more gift certificates which will make my meal 12 bux next visit.

This Place is Gorgeous! It's like walking into the W hotel. Classy! I enjoyed the trio of burgers, the specilaty cheddar popcorn and the prickly pear margarita poured into a martini glass so you can take the shaker and drink with you while you go watch a movie. Peferct date night.

I have been a regualr here since Lulu opened. Today she came in an hr early to fit a mani in for me. They have all the newest gelish, orly, shellac and OPI colors. Place is soo girly and pink and they are always offering a glass of bubbly. If you like gettong your nails perfected go see Lulu or Cookie. They are fun and will entertain you the whole time.

I was extremely excited to check this NEW restaurant out. I was craving BBQ and their menu was very enticing on-line.  I stopped in on a Sat night at 8:30 and it was pretty quiet.  Great menu options but very poor food, I had a combo plate with rubbery texture ribs  YUCK! and my Hubby had the pulled pork sand which was tasteless.  I would prob not go back.  Stacy's BBQ in Phx is much better as well as The Pitt's Again in Glendale.  Sugarbowl next door made up for the horrid meal.

This place is one of the finest NEW hidden gems in the Valley. Four Months new and hidden on 19th ave/Glendale area near a pizza joint.  Two visits and I am hooked. From 1.50 fish tacos to 6.50 shrimp burros this is a NOT miss spot.  The food is fresh, flavorful and full of kick.  This will be my regular rotation spot.  It is BYOB if you want some cerveza.  The owner is originally from Pasadena, CA and was with Roy's Restaurant at the Marriott for 12 years. Check it out if you want cheap, and fantastic food.

Another one bites the dust..newbie isnt gonna cut it with me. Nice clean space but not going back for the food.  Ordered a chicago dog with french fries. Husband had italian beef sand. Hotdog was boiled and not hot with a dill pickle sliced on it with relish, mustard and relish. BORING! fries were good though. The cost for 2 dogs and fries was $7 and sand was alright but wouldnt go back. Goto Luke's instead

Looks like I'm not going along with the majority here. I experienced JUST happy hr here a few months ago and was not happy with the service. The bartender was very unpleasant and not quick on her feet. Needless to say the hh drink specials can be hugely improved. Very weak selection. The food on the other-hand was good. We ordered the soft pretzel bites $5 which can feed a family of 4! and the antipasto platter was not as good. There was only 2 slices of tiny bread to eat with the cheeses, jams, etc..if I didn't have the pretzels I would have been pissed. Brussel sprouts came along side antipasto, they were prepared in a balsamic like marinade and were pretty damn great! Prob would go back fro pretzels and brussel sprouts but that's abt it.

This place is adorable! I was very excited to try it after hearing great reviews. Went in for lunch yesterday and ordered almost a lil of everything on the menu. Started with the wings ($9) in fish sauce. OMGGGGG best thing I ever ate. I would come here alone just for the wings. MUST ORDER. they were crisp and flavorful and made to order. Ordered spring rolls fried and not fried one with ahi tuna, mango, avo and other with chix and basil. Loved the tuna one more. Husband ordered the banh mi pork sandwich we were stuffed at this point. Huge sandwich $9 comes with choice of fries or ...We got the garlic fries. This place is fab I will be back to try their soups and other spring rolls.

First visit was a few weeks back. I was highly impressed with the space but than again Postino family does me no wrong.  We ordered a watermelon cocktail - It was eh. ($9) and the loaded potatoes as an app. They had bleu cheese, onions, and bacon on them and were handmade cut potato chips. Huge portion! got stuffed and decided to share a burger with the hubby. The burger was juicy and med-rare just how I wanted it. We got a side of church potatoes which were creamy delicious potatoes almost like a gratin. I had a glass of wine which they are all on tap here. It was okay..Definately wanna go back and try some other food options such as the Crabcake BLT and halibut Banh Mi.

I was very excited to use a groupon I purchased at this place. After hearing great reviews on twitter I decided to check it out. I ordered a chix pita, app of hummus and hubby ordered the filet sand kebob..both came with fries. (not a fan) the hummus was definatley lacking something was very tahini flavor. The chix was a joke. maybe 2 small pieces on the pita. The filet was horrid!! tasteless and just not good. Save your time and go to cyprus pita, pita jungle or Z's greek..

I am a fan of this great bbq joint. 2nd visit today & their brisket is awesome! I tried the creamed corn & it may be one if the best things I have ever had.   The spicy bbq sauce is delish & comes on the side in squeeze bottles. Parking could be tough during lunch hour but worth the trip! Food comes out right away & everyone is quite friendly here.

Gave my new neighborhood place a shot for lunch today after hearing a good review on twitter. If you are not familiar with Pakistanian food be ready to ask about everything on the menu. Prices range from $6-$12 and everything is made to order. Luckily it wasn't busy when we were there or we would have been looking at a 30 min wait for food. All in all it was very good. Husband played safe and went with the gyro which comes with fries. I got a chix, rice dish. The chix was orange in color and a bit spicy. We ordered some naan on the side as well. I will prob go back but again be prepared as there are NO descriptions of what the items on the menu are. People seemed to be asking tons of questions.

Oh my Ribeye!! Skip happy hour and go straight for the steak. Yes, the deviled eggs and Philly egg rolls are a notch above Applebee's but.. The steak was everything. It's price tag ($39) matches the quality. They perfectly cooked it med rare and was very impressive.  We ordered the chipotle Mac n cheese which was tasty as well.  Definitely if u live in the area and want to splurge this is is a perfect choice.

If there was a NO star button I would have posted it. I am not kidding when I say this place is a freaking nightmare. I honestly felt like I was eating breakfast at the Drury Inn. I soooo wanted to be excited about this place BUT... I am extremely scared of this place. First off it was Sunday and I was craving pumpkin pancakes.Saw they had them on the menu via yelp. Well no reg menu on Sunday's, just brunch. Ok fine, $10 a person and you can get an omelet, waffles (made to order cooking station) then the scary part. There is a dining area set up with sliced deli meat, potato salad (wtf), mini cupcakes and who cares what else. I wanted to run for my life. I ordered an omelet and all my veggies were raw in it. Disgusting to say the least. My waffles took forever cause they didn't spray the waffle iron so it stuck. I don't have all night to write this review but I will not be returning for any circumstance.

First time here and so underwhelmed. Haven't been to the original location in years but with all the other exotic Mexican restaurants in the area I will not be back. Ordered the shrimp Veracruz (blech) watery sauce and cheese looked horrible! Not filling either. Kick ass margs taste like laundry detergent. So sorry to report this place is a total disappointment.

I love this place! The price is aggressive 4.80 on avg and the place is clean and great service. I tried their tuna Sandwich and was thrilled! I am picky about tuna but there is is perfect and I actually cant stop thinking about it.  The sandwiches are about 6 inches are all toasted. YUMMY! they serve milkshakes and some salads as well. This is definitely in my rotation for quick lunch.

Seems service is lacking based on all the reviews and I agree, Not service by the bartender, service in the kitchen for to food taking way too long when it's quiet at the bar. Ordered truffle frites, flatbread pizza and escargot ( 10 min later) gor the escargot FIRST cold, and tasteless and frites finally came out with flatbread 20 min later??? gorg spot and live close by but mediocre at best.

Visited last night for dinner and I thought I should post an update.  The service was spectacular & the chicken parm ( bigger than a house) was incredible!!! It feeds at least 2 people and has a nice arugula salad on top with a side of tomato sauce. It also comes with a side of mac n cheese. I highly recommend this dish for some comfort.  My hubby had the bolognese and was huge fan as well.   TIP: They offer Sunday brunch with $15 all you can drink mimosa's & bloody Mary's.  I know where I'm headed for the weekend.

First visit this evening & it's def not my last. Wow! Chef Jesse knows his food game here. It may be far for most but it's a great place to indulge in comfort food at its finest. We had an array of apps to start: pretzel knots that taste almost like challah bread, fantastic! Mussels in a spicy coconut curry, portobello shrooms in a gruyere sauce & fried green tomatoes were perfection. I opted for chicken & waffles & they were to die! The porchetta special was a stand-out as well. Just go & taste why this is one of AZ's finest.

My new fave place. Honestly best happy hour! Half-off all wine including bottles. The food is superb, fell in love with the complimentary buckwheat biscuits w/vanilla butter. They are to die for! The sweetbread nuggets are a fave as well. The menu is extensive & genius. I can't wait to eat my way through the whole menu eventually. I also tried the mussels & okra w/pepper jelly, both fantastic.

If you have a large group & want to be loud this is a perfect spot to go. Nick the owner is extremely professional & accommodating to all your needs. You must order the Burrata & bolognese pasta! The group of 14 I was with all loved their food. Great location in old town Scottsdale & fun inviting atmosphere. Look forward to future visits.

I absolutely loved this restaurant. Visited from out of town on business and dined here last night. From the decor to the service to the food it is a must goto place! I had shrimp & calamari as an app. The pizza looked incredible but I didn't get a piece..bread was delicious! I had the seabass over rostr potatoes and veggies wow! Soooo good. We also had dessert: mini doughnuts filled with nutella were a stand-out plus I really liked the tiramisu. Make this part of your meal plan if your in the area. Can't wait to visit again.

I so wanted to fall in love with the cuteness of this place but unfortunately I walked out pissed off & underwhelmed. First off, 30-45 min wait.. Not worth it. They might give you complimentary coffee but then they charge you on your bill $5!!! The server said I had the coffee at my table?! Yeah, I just poured a cup!!!! While I waited, why wouldn't I bring it to my table? Who charges 2.50 a cup anyway? Coffee is free refills at Overeasy ( best bkfst) .  Dried up chicken sausage and blueberry Danish pancakes was very underwhelming. Will not be returning.

I never thought I would be writing this horrid review but here it goes.  Dined here tonight and ordered the porchetta .  50% of the meat was moist & tasty & the other 50% well, not so good for that matter. I thought I would leave my feedback to the server (not my original server) and he told me he had been there 7 weeks with no complaints... Yeah and? He said "are you full?" I said I'm fine. He then proceeded to tell me to come back next week & that there will be paella! Uh, what??? He also said he would have the chef come out. No chef came out so I went in. Met the manager who was a complete arrogant human being! He said "what would you like me to do?" I said I guess nothing! He went on and on telling me he was taking some porchetta home for dinner tonight & telling me I was wrong! Hmm the waiter just told me you were sold-out of the porchetta. I will NEVER return here agai.  What horrible bed side manners & food not worth paying for when there is far more better in town.  Also update your menu on your website! We went there  for 2 items that are not even on your menu!

Ugh. I really didn't like the hipster or owner that served me coffee today. That being said, the cold brew was pretty much inedible. I was hoping for a better experience than my 1st visit (when they opened their doors) but there are way better places to get my coffee buzz on.   Also, it was SO hot integrate at 10am this morning. They need A/C!!!   Sorry Sip, I'll skip your Arcadia location too. Even though I live a hop, skip, jump away.

So happy I popped in here for lunch on Friday. I had the red chile chicken salad... Grilled chicken cooked perfect and great layer of flavors. My only suggestion is that I would pay more and add more chicken to the salad. I didn't find it that filling.  My hubby had the BBQ pork sandwich and it was really tasty! Loved the flavors. It is such a cute comfy place ( the most comfortable chairs) I can't wait to try other things on their menu.

Fab lunch here this week. Started with the chicken & Waffle (steamed bun style/taco) hot, fresh right off the stove. Also I sampled the pork belly bun--YUM   Lunch was a bowl of ramen $5 then you add your add-ins egg, pork belly, Bok Choy w/many other options as well.   Overall everything from the service to the food was very good. I want to try some cocktails one evening in the near future.

First visit last night & was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the food. I have read some spotty reviews on here, therefore I didn't rush to try the restaurant until now.  We were greeted by the chef within 5 minutes of sitting at the bar which was very welcoming. We decided to start with the pork belly & Burrata. They are both huge portions and the Burrata is brought in by Gina's Homemade which I have been a fan of for many years. Delicious creamy Burrata served with a tomato jam & arugula salad.  The pork belly was good as well. Next time I will try a few other things because the menu is quite lengthy. I was going to try the lobster bisque which is their Friday Soup of the Day.   Overall everything was great including the atmosphere.  I do appreciate not having to ask for water though, it should be given mandatory. It is a personal pet peeve.  3.75 stars- check it out!

Wow, wow, wow! What a great new addition to downtown phoenix. Ross Simon the owner is a cocktail genius  & is ready to please your palate on so many levels. From a Book O' Cocktails to the food menu this is going to be the new hot spot in town. I was lucky enough to enjoy a sneak peek Friday night and started off with a Singapore Sling & the house popcorn (amazing!!!) the marshmallow dessert comes on a graham cracker stick served with a side of melted chocolate! So amazing. The cheese/charcuterie board is complete perfection. The ramen with cuttlefish is like nothing in Phoenix. Make this your first stop when they open their doors on May 30th. It will be a must go to place!

Stopped in for a quick drink last night & decided to order the Korean wings as well. Here's my take on this spot.  A. 9:30 on a Friday night and we were the only people there  B. Never head of this place until recently & they have been open 4 months!!!  C. Wings were bland as could be! I make better wings. There was no seasoning on them whatsoever.  D. Cheap eats from 7-10 PM $5 apps & $7 drinks (very girly overly sweet drinks)   No need to go back.

Checked this spot out based on being in the area & yelp reviews. We were the only people here but it is a very traditional Italian restsurant & comfortable place to grab dinner. I was disappointed they didn't have pizza like the pics I saw on yelp... They are changing out their ovens so they should be installed in 2 weeks.  I ordered chicken Vesuvio which was really good. I'm not a huge eater & I was able to eat it all! Delish cream sauce with garlic served with penne. There is serf room for dessert or an app if you have an appetite.  I will go back again and check out the pizza.

First visit on a Saturday night & this new spot has no problem packing a place! Beautiful decor. Started with a passion fruit cocktail which consisted of Mezcal tequila, passion fruit and ginger beer it was served in a stainless steel mug.  The presentation was not only beautiful but refreshing and delish. My patron margarita unfortunately was too sweet and my counterparts agreed.   We ordered quite a bit of sushi & it was all lovely. The nigiri needs some work but the rolls were very good, small & petite, the perfect bite.  The Korean steak tacos got an A+ from 2 of my dining companions.  Another standout is the green mojito. Wow! Tastes like  a coconut boozy milkshake. I would order it for dessert!   Our server was Chelsea and she was attentive, and was very good at her job.   I look forward to going back again and trying more of the menu as well as happy hour.

First visit this evening and I must say Dustin can make a cocktail! First off, if u go on a Tuesday it's 30% off mescal (my fave spirit) as well as tequila.  All I can say is the talent behind the new Mabel's is a keeper! All around a comforting environment & in loved sitting at the bar. I have a sweet spot for a bartender to give recommendations based on my palate & this is what you will receive here.  Happy Hour is 4-7 with half-priced specialty cocktails. Please make it your next cocktail destination & see Dustin on Tue, Thu and Saturday. I can't wait to go back again.

A very well deserved 5-stars. Checked out my new neighborhood spot last night & was overly impressed with the level of customer service & the amazing shrimp in trifecta sauce ($12) with a level medium heat. They know how to bring the heat! Be careful when ordering your heat level.   The interior is fun and lively. I think the pricing is very fair & I look forward to trying out lobster, and fried clams!   What an amazing addition to the neighborhood! Keep up the good work.

Ugh. Really wanted to like this place. Service was below par to put it nicely. 15 min to get drinks on a quiet night is not acceptable.  Will not be returning for many reasons #1 bad service #2 food was mediocre at best. Had the chips & guac= meh. Poke tuna was unmemorable tacos I heard were meh but not worth heading back. Service was horrendous! Margarita was ew. Not much more to say.

Amazing delicious fresh clean food. Order anything and you will be pleased. I had the chicken couscous and it was awesome! Complimentary hummus and bread and date shakes! Love this spot.

Free lunch on a rainy Monday, yes please!  Thanks to the Thirsty Lion for the invite. We shared the Scotch eggs (first time trying these) very Delish but high in calories of course! I opted for the seared ahi salad, very good amount of tuna and wasn't able to finish more than half. My date had a burger that was devoured. Perfectly cooked med rare and nice & juicy. This is a great place that offers everything! Big screen TV's for the sports fanatic too.

Late night hidden gem. You need to go see Micah & Keifer & enjoy some of the best, inventive, creative cocktails in AZ. Their hours are only 10pm-2am. It is next door to Cowboy Ciao and is the perfect place for a late night date or just a good time. Go enjoy!

Friendliest staff  Clean Fabulous healthy food  I absolutely live this place! Make your own salads with locally sourced tomatoes & lettuces. Yes, please. I tried the Ty Cobb with the low fat ranch and it was perfect. Citrus grilled chicken (I think), bacon, egg, red onion, tomato, lettuces. I will definitely be making this part of my weekly lunch rotation. If your into freshly squeezed juices, this is the spot too! Price point is on point. Can't wait to enjoy another meal here.

Loved this event! I'm obsessing over gin right now. I loved learning how to make these fabulous cocktails. It's the perfect complement to the AZ heat. I look forward to entertaining by making the gin lemonade one very soon!

Fantastic brunch! They just opened their doors and this place is packed to the gills! Very hospitable, comfortable, and most of all killer menu/food.  Smoked beets with ricotta & pistachio- phenomenal   Chimichanga- fantastic  Bacon- meh. Not worth ordering, flimsy & didn't  seem to be thicker than Oscar Meyer.  Skillet pancake (special) pretty amazing!   Just go! I. Abt waiters eat through this fantastic menu.

Great cold brew! Tried this spot for my first time today. Friendly owners and great tasting coffee. They have soft serve ice cream which was vanilla bean flavor. I look forward to sampling other items on the menu. I would of given 5-stars but parking is not convenient. 3 meters to park at across the street or good luck finding a spot!

Checked this out last night & I must say that it might just be my fave new place for cocktails. Wow! Hunter is the mixologist there & this guy knows how to mix a cocktail. You must order an old-fashioned from him and I loved the dog hunt ( not sure the name) cocktail!!! Can't wait to go back for more! Had the fried green tomatoes and biscuits and sausage gravy, both solid. Wed night is fried chicken night & I need to check that out!
