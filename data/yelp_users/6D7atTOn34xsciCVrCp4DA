First time dining there last night.  Eggplant Parm was great although prepared differently than most.  It came looking like a piece of lasagne which the waiter did describe.  It was very tasty and had a little crispness on top which I like.  Linguine accompanied the dish and it was cooked perfectly.  Marinara was excellent.  Add some cauliflower and brocolli and it was a perfect dish.  A small field green salad was included although the salad was nothing special.  My wife had a special which was sole with a lemon caper sauce.  She raved about it.  Hers also came with linguine and some sauteed spinach which looked great and tasted great, too.  Atmospher was terrific.  Dark, warm and friendly.  Service was terrific.  Greg the wwner circulates and greets all his guests.  Many knew him so he must get lots of regulars.  Singer/keyboard in the lounge at 6:45pm so we only heard a little bit since we had to rush off to the Symphony.  But the performer was very good and NOT LOUD which was wonderful.  Just some night background music that seemed to match the older age of the customers.  We've driven past this place many times wondering what the food was like.  Glad we bought a Local Dines deal which was our incentive to try it out.  We'll definitely return with or without a coupon.  Two entrees, two glasses of wine, 1 cup of coffee = $90 (inl. tax and tip) before coupon.

Great selection of furniture at very good prices.  Our salesperson, Lea, was FABULOUS!  She was very helpful without being too intrusive or aggressive.  It was a real pleasure doing business with this store.

Unbelievable how helpful and friendly everyone is at this store especially Paul who helped me with a difficult match.   I wouldn't go anywhere else for paint.

I'm not big on sports bars but today I wanted to watch the Broncos vs. Giants (AKA The Manning Bowl) and the only way to see the game was at a place like this.  I had GREAT nachos which I shared with a friend.  She had a couple of frozen margaritas and I had a beer.  That wasn't a huge tab for spending three hours at hour table watching the football game.  and they never tried to rush us or up sell us on more food or drink.  We could have sat at our table another three hours and it would have been OK with them.  They have a great menu for a sports bar.  Can't wait to go back and try some other things.  They have a huge patio with many screens and the patio is dog friendly which I'll take advantage of when it cools off.  All in all it was one of the friendliest sports bars I've ever visited.  I think I found my new neighborhood "Cheers".

How cool that Jennifer responds to each and every review with individualized comments not a boilerplate reply.  She reads each review and her comments relate to what the reviewer had to say.  That really shows they care about what their customers think.  Good job KO's!

Best fried class outside of Boston.  Full clams with bellies.  Cooked just right.  A little on the small size but a generous portion.  Nice steak fries and cole slaw come with it.  The cole slaw was OK but nothing special.  The waitresses were fabulous - very friendly and genuinely happy I chose this place.  Made me feel right at home.  The New England Chowder was better than average though again nothing special.  An excellent menu of all things New England.  You can't help but find something terrific to order.  It's hidden away in an obscure strip mall so be sure you know where you're going or you'll have trouble finding it.

Had many dentists in many communities but Dr. Clayton is ny far the best.  Genuinely cares about his patients.  Soft touch.  Office runs like a Swiss Clock.  Never wait for Dr. or hygenist.  Dr. calls patients at home at night after procedures to see how they are doing.  EXCELLENT!

Did a great job.  Finished in half projected time because they had two guys working on the car.  The place is not impressive and kind of dirty but they seem to do good work.

The worst part of this place is that it is 45 minutes from our house :)  We took a chance on Great Wall because it was close to a theater we were going to in Queen Creek.  We figured "How bad could it be?"  Well, it was FABULOUS.  The best Chinese food I've eaten since moving to AZ 10 years ago.  The place was pretty full for early on a Thursday.  But the lines of people waiting to pick up or order TO GO had to be seen to be believed.  If you live in the area you're lucky so try it you'll like it.  And if you live far away like us, it may even be worth a Sunday drive to get a delicious dinner.

We had solar screen's made and installed onsite at our home.  Fast, efficient, reasonably priced, wonderful to do business with, Marty, the owner, did the install and he is meticulous.  This was a fabulous experience and I couldn't be happier with the work.

John and Leo were wonderful.  They moved us without a hitch.  And they wrestled a very unwieldy sofa bed t through a window and over the patio fence then through the apartment to the truck.  They didn't bat an eyelash and did it with a smile and a lot of muscle.  Not a dent, not a scratch.  Two very good natured and capable guys who couldn't have been friendlier or more efficient.  Camelback was recommended by Lea, our sales person at the Room Store.  I had my doubts but they lived up to and beyond expectations.  The price was right and the service was fantastic.  Thankfully I won't be moving again but if I needed something moved I would call Camelback Moving for sure.

Owners treat everyone like their most valued customers.  They are friendly, chatty and genuinely warm and welcoming.  Nothing is ever a problem.  The food is wonderful and they do very creative things with meat substitutes.  Generous portions, excellent prices, high quality dishes that are served pleasing to the eye, nose and mouth.    Great to have a top notch Kosher place in North Scottsdale.

Worst thing about this place is that it's 20+ miles from my home.  Wish they were in North Scottsdale :)  Food is amazing.  They're really magicians with the various veggie products they use.  Presentations of plates is excellent.  Portions are large.  The place is nothing to look at and not a lot of seating but sure worth going for some terrific vegetarian and vegan food.  They're moving soon and will be a little further north but they need to move another 20 miles for this to be one of my regular haunts for lunch and dinner.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We love NYPD. My girlfriend thinks they have the best gluten free pizza and I love their eggplant parmigiana sandwich. The other night I picked up our regular order and when I got home we discovered that there was an error in the usual pizza toppings. After dinner we called NYPD to let them know. Without batting an eyelash the NYPD staff person apologized and said they wanted to send us a coupon for a free pizza the next time we ordered from them. In a couple of days a $20 gift certificate came in the mail. WOW!!! Talk about great customer service. Thanks NYPD!

I admit I would not have tried the place without their "50% off the bill" coupon but we did eat there last night.  Only one other table had guests so that may explai why our service was so attentive.  Pat, whose family owns the place, could not have been more pleasant and enjoyable.  The food came out in a timely way.  The sushi was wonderful.  The rolls were presented in a beautiful way and each had it's own little special twist that made them stand out from other modestly priced competitors.  The Tom kar soup was very good but could have used a little more coconut milk.  it was a VERY generous bowl for a very reasonable price.  The rice paper spring rolls were unique and delicious and came with a warm peanut sauce for dipping.  The three rolls were cut into nice pices so each piece was mouth-sized.  Except for the too dimply lit room and the feel of a Subway sandwich place converted to a Thai/Japanese eatery it was great.  It will definitely be on our list of regular places to go for mid-week grazing.  can't wait to try some of the many other interesting sounding dishes.

Tonight was our second visit and it was even better than the first.  Glad to see the place was very full.  Hope it continues if they stop running their coupons.  Ginger salmon was very good.  Miso soup was served in a large bowl and for $1.50 is pretty amazing.  They are even able to modify it so it is strictly vegetarian.  They are VERY accomodating.  Pat stopped by our table to refill drinks more times than we could count.  Even with one server we never felt neglected and the food came out promptly.  Spicy tuna roll was excellent.  Other sushi was also very good.  The most amazing part is that having only been there once before Pat remembered us.  She even guessed that I was one who wrote a Yelp review.  She really takes pride in knowing her customers.  It's definitely on my list to talk up at work and elsewhere.  Wish they'd increase the lighting a little more since it's very dimly lit.  Except for the spring roll which we had on our first visit, all items tonight were different from the last time and we look forward to trying even more items from their menu on the next visit.

Back again last night for a third time.  I love it when a restaurant can accomodate us by modifying an item.  The Grilled Chicken soup was converted to a strictly vegetarian version and the bowl was HUGE.  My wife finished it because it is favorite thing to eat.  They added tofu and changed the broth to a miso-like broth.  Mmmmmm!  It had numerous pieces of fish cake.  Great udon noodles and loaded with vegetables.  The sushi was good as always.  And Pat makes you feel like you're an old friend.  We always leave happy.

The entire staff from front desk to techs to vets are fabulous.  They genuinely care about every "patient" and family.  They are competent, fun and wonderful to be with.  I've taken my new Maltipoo there twice.  First visit was a well-dog checkup and chip implant.  We were treated well and promptly and not rushed at all.    Second visit was because of what turned out to be a slipped disc.  Dr. "Casey" spent lots of time explaining what was going on and setting out a treatment plan.  She went over the ex rays in detail and explained everything we needed to know.  24 hours later Emmie is feeling much better and is starting to get back to normal.  It's hard to imagine how much better care and service could be for my dog than at McDowell Mountain Animal Hospital.  What a great sense of security knowing that an excellent vet team is close by when they're needed.

I know very little about Scotch beyond my enjoyment of Chivas Regal which is a blend.  I wanted to try a single malt that would be close to the taste of Chivas but better.  And I didn't want a bottle that would break the bank.  Bob, a manager at Total Wine took me under his wing and gave me an actual class  Scotch right in the scotch aisle.  It was like going to Scotch school.  Bob considers himself  a Scotch  expert and I was eager to learn.  Bob could have sold me on a bottle for $50 more but instead he recommended a bottle for lessthan $30 which he said was EXCELLENT.  I was treated like a guy about to drop hundreds of dollars not a customer looking to buy one modestly priced bottle.  Bob could care less how much I was soending.  His goal was to make me and educated and happy customer.  He succeeded big time.  What a wonderful experience it was shopping at Total Wine.

Went here many months ago and had a terrible experience.  Very few people in the place on a mid-week evening and yet it took forever to get our food.  Sushi came out item by item instead of all together so people had to wait until their order came while others were eating.  Food was OK but service was horrible.  Thought I'd give it a second chance tonight but they are nothing if not consistent.  Took 45 minutes for first of three rolls to come out.  Then  10 minutes between #2 and #3.  Meanwhile my guest ordered salmon and that was finished before my first roll appeared.  When I let it be known that I was not pleased the waitress actually tried to convince me that we waited too long to decide and because there was only one sushi chef other tables got their orders in before ours.  Wait, it was my fault?  I don't think so.  Two strikes and your out.  Every place deserves a second chance but not a third so this place is scratched from my list of places to go for dinner.

Amazing new Greek restaurant.  We've been waiting for a place that understands Greek food and the way whole fish should be cooked and prepared Greek-style.  Superb whole black sea bass, saganaki was terrific, excellent Greek salad.  Our waitrerss Jenna had enough energy to light up a small town.  Low noise levels which is important to us.  Priced right for such high quality and ample portions.  Can't think of any improvements needed.  Our new favorite place.

Great place for breakfast.  But as good as the food is, and it's terrific, the wait staff and owners make you feel right at home.  Super service.  Bright, clean, large 50's-style diner.  Lots of regulars.  The customers know the staff and the staff definitely knows their customers.

Good food... worst service on earth.   Staff has no idea what is in their food.   Manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors.   Too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good.  Walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is.

My new favorite restaurant near Grayhawk.  How could food and service be so great after just one week.  Amazing value!  Staff is superb.  German, who owns the place, walks around and genuinely engages with his customers not in the usually patronizing or obilgatory way.  Wait staff is actually enjoyable to talk with.  This place has really figured out how to make you feel welcome.  And the food was amazing.  My only fear is that we may be going so often that we'll get burned out.  But if so, it will take a long time.  A fabulous experience in every respect.  Welcome to our neighborhood, Local Bistro.  Please stay for a long, long time.

I've been to this place 4-5 times and NEVER had a decent meal.  Service is slow with totally indifferent servers.  The food I've had has been dreadful but today was the worst.  I went reluctantly with a friend who needs a Kosher place to eat but this is the last time.  I had the simplest dish possible - lox and eggs and onion scramble.  The eggs were cold.  I needed a magnifying glass to find the microscopic bits of lox which I probably could have counted on one hand.  The toast was overly toasted and may even have been less than fresh bread.  It was ready to be broken up and used as croutons.  I asked what could be substituted for the salad that came with it.  Who eats tossed salad with a breakfast dish?  They brought home fries which were dripping in cooking oil.    And all this for a mere $16.  I'd like to be able to support a Kosher restaurant even though I don't keep Kosher but this tests any desire to be loyal to Kosher establishments.  Never again!

Great food and would have given it 5 stars but it is painfully loud.  The music does not fit the demographic of the customers.  Please tone it down even if you insist on playing the same awful music so we can come back and enjoy our dinner able to have conversation instead of yelling over the music.

As these types of places go it was well below average.  A.better choice would be YC's at Indian Bend near the 101.  This place was not big on being clean and tidy.  Ingredients were not fresh looking on bar.  Presented a bowl that host had his fingers in.  Asked for another and was accommodated but he looked stunned.  All in all a mediocre experience.

Oh dear, what can the matter be?  EVERYTHING!!!  What a train wreck of an experience.  First, very difficult to find.  Unfortunately, we found it.  The place was empty at 7:30 while all other nearby Borgata restaurants were full.  That should have been a clue.  Had a Deal Chicken certificate so we had one appetizer, two entrees and two non-alcoholic beverages.  Appetizer was an overly toasted cardboard-like english muffin with some cream cheese, avocado and sundried tomato.  They said Bella! Bella! Bella.  I say, insipid.  Raspberry Lassi drink was good but strawberry spritzer was not.  Two glasses of warm water were delivered.  I asked about ice and waitress said she'd see if they had any.  Had any?  Really?  Salmon entree sounded good on menu but they were out.  Tilapia sounded good but they had no tilapia and were substituting sole which was very fishy smelling and tasting.  Supposed to be served with millet but they were out and substituted brown rice which looked like a very pale, pasty, tasteless grool.  Single fork wrapped in paper napkin.  No spoon, no knife, no salt/pepper on table. Sign on door written in crayon said that there might be some delays since four staff left suddenly.  Smart people.  They abandoned ship before the sinking.  Glad I used the Deal Chicken certificate now because if I waited much longer they will surely be deservedly dark.  Can't remember laughing so much and so hard over such a terrible dining experience.

It's a little loud but otherwise a comfortable place.  Good selection of made-from-scratch Italian food.  Generous portions, very reasonable prices, attentitve and knowledgeable wait staff,  great flavors.  All around a very positive experience.  Glad that there was a gluten free menu for those who have issues with wheat-based pasta.  Modifying selections was not a problem.  Looking forward to eating leftoveres for dinner tonight which made the price/meal a great value.Glad to see a restaurant in D.C. Market busy since many places just don't make ti there.  Hope Mia Francesca is around a long time.

Other than being a very noisy place we loved Cuttlefish.  We bought a $67 Living Social deal for a $133 prix fixe dinner for two.  Great deal!  Geno was a terrific server.  We ordered oysters, Caesar salads, lobster ravioli and sole putanesca with gnochi and ripini sides.  Portions are very large.  Fish entree could have served three people easily.  Food was excellent.  Came with dessert and we chose panna cotta which was different but very good.  The limoncello was actually made from mandarin oranges and it was OK but if you like limoncello as I do it was disappointing.  Very reasonable wine list in terms of selection and price.  All in all a great place for a nice dinner out in the Gainey Ranch area.

A nice change of pace.  I like the fact that the dishes come with brown or white rice or rice noodles.  The noodles are not chilled as advertised but room temperature which is OK.  The tofu is very lightly fried but be careful if you don't want your dish to be spicy ask for the tofu to be prepared without the seven spices which makes it really hot with a powerful kick.  Toppings are nicely done, fresh, and plentiful.  The price is certainly good and the portions are large.  A nice large covered/shaded patio but it might be hot in the summer since there didn't seem to be misters.  The concept seems to be catching on since places like Pelini, Fired, Which Wich and others are all giving you the opportunity to customize your meal from a variety of toppings or add-ins.  I'll definitely be back.

Surprisingly good food.  Excellent service and prompt preparation of food from sushi chefs and kitchen.   Not very busy on a Saturday night which makes me wonder if they'll be around for a while.  I'm sure that our bill at a regular sushi restaurant would have been $100+ but the tab for the two of us was $40 plus tip.
