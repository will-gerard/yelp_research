I am so surprised that this place has such mediocre reviews!  Maybe I had a fluke experience or something, but everything about it was phenomenal!  I must admit we didn't have sushi, we had edamame, lettuce cups, a teriyaki chicken dish, and the horseradish mashed potatoes.  Oh my gosh, it was all lick-you-plate-clean delicious!  I mean the sauce that came with the lettuce cups was really incredible - a TON of flavor! The horseradish had the perfect "hint" or horseradish so they weren't overpowering and the teriyaki chicken was far from average!   We had drinks and for 2 the total was $50 bucks or so, and we had a great, attentive, funny server.  I have nothing to fault the place with.  I'll keep going, and hopefully my standards stay about the same!

Ok. I have to give a shout out to the guy working the ticket booth. Me and my friend Megan almost peed our pants we were laughing so hard. Plus, he gave us student prices without hesitation. BIG perk. He made us feel young. Plus, I think he had a man-crush on my boyfriend... that's a compliment, right?

So it was my first time to the Metro Park area, and my first time at Mimi's Cafe...  and I must admit that for a chain, this place is just great!  We sat on the patio, I had the "Chicken, Fruit, and Baby Greens Salad" and it came with one of the best spiced muffins I ever had!  The salad was DELICIOUS. I mean like top 5 salads of my life.  Like way up there. Every bite was a little different, very fresh, perfect amount of fruit and feta cheese. Wow. I loved it.  My boyfriend had the Tuna Salad Sandwich and wasn't a RAVING fan, but he still liked it.  Our server was Kimberly, and she was cute and really great. She understood my frustration with the Strawberry Lemonade (WAYYY too sweet!) and recommended a delish Arnold Palmer.    Last, we told our server that it was our first time to a Mimi's, and she brought us a free sampling of muffins for us to try!!! I mean like an entire box of huge, complimentary muffins.  I don't think a simple Sunday lunch could have gotten better!

So I have completely been MIA lately! It makes me sad, and I realized that I haven't not been going to as many new places or seeing new sites without Yelp's guidance! So this is my return.  Old Town Tortilla Factory was a-ok in my books! I had the enchilada and it was truly delicious. It was almost tex-mex and not truly a "mexican" enchilda, but it was still tasty! The sauce had just the right amount of kick, the tortilla appetizer was delicious, and our server was friendly and gave us space. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's not TRULY mexican food...  The only thing I would change? It was cold and windy and the heater wasn't close enough to our table to really warm things up ... but if that's my only complaint it wasn't too shabby. :)

Location, location location...  But this time, the location is the thing I DON'T love!!!  It seems to be mostly true that Scottsdale = "Snotsdale."  Most of the girls I've met laying out or in the gym seem stuck up and wayyyyy to cool hang out with anyone but their "tan, buff" boy toys - gross.  Maybe I was wrong to think that I could make friends in an apartment complex with 400 apartments ... but geeeeez, I'm glad I like my roommates or I'd be one lonely lady!  Anyways, back to Crown Court...  I think it's nearly impossible to give an apartment a TRUE 5 star rating... there's always going to be the little complaints: loud neighbors, people driving to fast through the parking lots, dirty pools, maintenance not responding fast enough, and old appliances.  Sure, all of these things happened, but in all fairness it has been a really good experience.  I've never seen a bug, the office ladies have actually been really great, and it's across the street from a new park area...  We're getting ready to move out and I think I'm having a slight little tinge of sadness.  It could just be because I sort-of loved blaming my high maintenance on living on Princess Drive.....

5 Stars- Seriously, FIVE STARS FOR THE SWEET POTATO ROLL!!!!!!!!!  Now, it's probably not a traditional roll, but man is it tasty!  5 Stars- Happy Hour prices are seriously out of this world - 15 dollar TOTAL for 2 people with drinks, edamame, and 3 rolls!!!  3 Stars- I'm sorry, this was SLOOOOOWWWW, for service  = 4.5 Stars! Not quite "as good as it gets", but pretty darn close. I will definitely be back!

The only thing saving this place was the bruschetta!  It was delicious, and I'm really a sucker for the stuff...   After seeing all of the good reviews, I was really excited to try this place.  We walk in late Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago without a reservation (God forbid!) and get attitude from the hostess who looked me up and down right when we walked in.  "Uhm, I think we will be able to get out you in. Do you want to sit outside?"  Anyways, we got a small, cozy table in the corner which is my favorite!  Our server was fine, nothing to complain about, but he really didn't do anything to make an impression.  I ordered lasagna, and I was really pumped for it.  But then I almost spit out the first bite! It tasted like overcooked, processed Spaghetti-O's! The pasta wasn't right, the sauce was dreadful and watery, and the spices seemed like they were only trying to cover up the horrible attempt at lasagna.  Disgusting.  My boyfriend liked his entree, but we agreed we wouldn't want to go back.  If you go, MAKE A RESERVATION and do not get the lasagna.

I really cannot believe the beating my body took hiking the camel's hump...  I mean, I thought I was in pretty good shape!  But this cute, little Chihuahua kicked my butt on the way up!!!   I'm gonna keep doing this, because the view from the top is worth it.  Oh, and because I want to take friends to Camelback when they visit ... and I can't stand to be beat by the tiny dog anymore!

I'm a fan.  I must admit it because my favorite accessories are def. IKEA.  And I get compliments on them.  And I really like that.  Now, if their employees (namely the bi***y girl at the cashout) were as nice as the nick-nacks, they would have 5 stars.

So I only went here because it was 10 on a Sunday night, and I guess all mexican restaurants in the area close before then. So this was the last option.  And I was REALLY surprised. The manager offered us free drinks, I had the best tostada in town, and the chips and salsa were really good too.  Overall, we paid 10 bucks for a great meal.  By the way, if you like people-watching, this place is a must-go. My boyfriend and I were entertained the entire time!

I cannot believe I haven't given a review of Pita Jungle yet! This is our lunch spot! And apparantly the rest of Phoenix considers it their lunch spot too....  Good luck finding a parking spot ... Have fun waiting for a seat ... ... because it is going to be busy!  We've started parking at the Walgreen's close by because it's ALWAYS packed. Annoying as it might be ... it just shows how AMAZING this place really is.  The hummus is sooo addictive. Seriously. I can't go a week without it! Their beef gyro puts Greek restaurants to shame. The cucumbers and tomatoes that come with the hummus are just scrumptious.  No matter what you're in the mood for - Pita Jungle will satisfy!

I love living here! We're almost a year in, and I am so sad that Grigio Tempe Town Lake has such mediocre reviews! Everything about our living experience so far has been amazing; plus our apartment is gorgeous! I'm always excited to go home to our lovely abode!  Grigio Tempe Town Lake definitely capitalizes on being a luxury apartment. They have generous outside parking, a double-gated parking garage, THREE pools and hot tubs, a sweet rooftop area you can hang out at and chill and watch sunsets, and an amazing gym (Hey - I even canceled my gym membership because it is seriously that nice.) Plus, I feel REALLY safe here - parking spots are easy to find and it's bright and well lit. There was also a news story about how Gray Development does crazy background checks on all new rental applicants!   The rent does seem a little more expensive at first, but when you factor in FREE cable (high-def if it's built into your TV!), Direct TV, DVR, high speed internet, an amazing 24-hour gym, pool, and hot tub (no gym membership needed here), a sexy rooftop hang out area, a technology room with printing, the community center, the high-end units, and the amazing customer service, it is really worth the cost.  My favorite part is that every inch of space in the apartments is completely usable. They are dynamic layouts that let you really play with the design of your home. Plus the bathrooms, closets and storage are laid out so well.  I also love that the location is less than a block away from Starbucks, YogurtLand, and In and Out!   We also lived in apartments in the Old Town Scottsdale area in the last few years, and I can say with confidence that Grigio Tempe Town Lake is head and shoulders above the quality you get anywhere else in the S. Scottsdale/North Tempe area. Honestly, if you are looking for a new apartment you have got to check out Grigio - you will fall in love too!

Let me preface this by saying that I really like Zipps. I love their foccacia, 1/2 and 1/2 side, and cheap happy hour drinks. Usually we go to the location in Old Towne, but we met a friend up North and figured it's always a safe space to go. Our food lived up to our expectations.  The 1-Star rating goes to the full credit of our server who was stuck-up and unhappy from the get-go. My food came out wrong, she charged me extra for asking to have the dressing on the side, and she insulted my mathematical intelligence by writing and circling our total bill on my credit card receipt because my friend paid cash. All of this with frequent eye-rolls. She even managed to make me feel bad about my food coming out wrong - without so much as an apology.  As a summary, here are words that I would use to describe her attempt at serving: 1. Rude 2. Uninterested 3. Arrogant 4. Nickel-and-dimer 5. Inconsiderate 6. Disrespectful 7. Insulting 8. Impatient 9. Neglectful 10. Blatantly immature  Because of her poor service, I talked to the manager about our experience before we left (Take my word for it, it really was that bad). He apologized for our experience, and was quite friendly. She responded by saying rude things about our table to over 5 of her co-workers within earshot of our table.  This experience was a disgrace to all of the great times we've had at other Zipps locations, and my only hope is that this is an isolated incident.

OH MY GOSH!!! If you have not tried Bertha's Cafe, you, my dears, are sorely missing out.  Great lunch. I mean really, truly great.  If I could give Bertha's 6 stars, I would, darn it.  From the adorable "scrapbook"-like table numbers they hand out, to the homey restaurant, to the mini-red velvet cupcakes, to the best pasta salad I have ever had, this place has it down to the "T".  They have perfected their sandwiches, the "cracked pepper and sea salt" chips are tangified and kettle cooked, the Chicken Tortilla soup had just the right amount of "kick" to it, and the harvest salad was enough to make me come back every day.  Bertha's Cafe is a quaint, quiet delicious nook of a restaurant where everything is home made, no trans fats, home made dressings, you get the gist.  They have unique sandwiches and fabulous salads that come with a bag of chips AND a cookie! Seriously! I felt like I was stealing from my grandma because it was all too good to be true.  Just a tip: Get there before the end of April!  They will be closed from April 24 - June for a remodel and they will reopen on Indian School and 32nd Street (the owner told me all about it today!).  The new place will be bigger, and hopefully the restroom won't be in the back of the kitchen!

I really love Sushi Brokers! I've been over 5 times and I've always had pretty good service! The Sushi outshines the service, hands down.  Only go for happy hour - it is overpriced for normal hours. But the food is seriously VERY good. All of these other reviews are just hatin'.

Love a free sweet corn tamale! It was sooo good. And so were the housemade flour chips! I wish they were the only representation I had of Jalapeno Inferno because this review would look much different.  However ... and this is big ... the $75.00 on 2 margarita pitchers was totally a RIP OFF.... are you kidding me? Not cool, Bistro Mexicano, not cool.  They offered pitchers for the group - and we're like "WOW, that's great." And then they charged us for 8 individual overpriced margaritas that they dumped into glorified glass mugs... I guess "bistro" is like code for snotty bartender, overpriced drinks, slow service, and "B" at best mexican food.  I'd go here again, but I'd definitely have to pre-game the Margaritas beforehand... otherwise the first 30 minutes of the night will be signing an "official document" verifying we're of legal age. And then top it off by throwing down a Benjamin for two measly margarita pitchers...  I wanted to love it. And I just really didn't - not at all.

My teachers always said "Don't judge a book by the cover." And Z's Greek completely proves their point!   A co-worker suggested Z's Greek, and I obliged since I was feeling quite indecisive. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I immediately regretted that decision. I was brainstorming excuses left and right of the reasons why I "wasn't hungry" or was worried about how greek food would "settle."   Then a lush, green, scrumptious looking salad came out of the kitchen. I ordered one. Pronto.  It had tons of lettuce, a really tasty dressing, the perfect amount of cheese, and gyro meat... and I didn't want the lunch to end! The salad itself is to die for, the lettuce is always crisp, the tomatoes always juicy, and the pita points on the side just finish it off perfectly.  Granted the wobbly booth wasn't the most comfortable seat, and the ambiance was sort-of nonexistent. But man, their food and friendly service will keep me coming back.

I was surprisingly impressed with NoRTH!  Our waiter was Eric, and even though the service was a little slow, he redeemed himself with his drink/wine recommendations.  We're picky with wine and he nailed it! It was the best Zin ever! Loved it!!!  The tomato-melted bruschetta was amazzzzing, but it was a REALLY small portion! I had the chopped salad which had a really unique dressing and my boyfriend had the halibut feature... the orzo side with it was delicious...  We finished with a Cranberry-Basil sorbet which was refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet!  If you're looking for a trendy, italianish restaurant, NoRTH is really top class!

WOW! This Jo-Anns rocks!!! I couldn't believe the great stuff you could get! I don't know if I was there during an extreme sale, but everything was 25-60% off! I mean scrapbook stuff, baskets, canvases, and a whole lot more! The girls working there were very sweet too!  If you like crafts even a little bit, this place will totally suck you in!

There was nothing I didn't like!  I was totally the annoying customer that tried all 50 flavors!!!  I couldn't help myself though - each one was more distinct and unique than the one before.    I just wish you could get half scoops or something so you could get more flavors in one cone!  Just a tip: they even heated up my boyfriend's cookie so it was warm and the chocolate chips were all melty!

Ok, so we knew the chef and he hooked us up with a huge sampling of the best of everything (no exaggeration!).  But I think that even if we paid full price, and only got to try a few of their appetizers and one Paella, I still would be giving Imagine Spain 5 stars.  It was really slow, and I felt sorry for the staff ... they seemed bored ... so all of you yelpers, go check out Imagine Spain.  It's delicious and more importantly, unique.  That's sometimes hard to find with the mass of cookie-cutter restaurants around here....

I wanted to like this place a lot. I really did.  I stayed here for work & it seems like an overpriced, wanna-be luxury hotel. It's like they don't quite have the luxury hotel feel or execution, but they want to charge for it.  i mean, the pool and rooftop bar are the only thing really keeping this above a one-star rating.  It was disappointing that they just couldn't nail the simple things. For example, a friend ordered a burger, and got it on toasted bread. The server explained that they ran out of hamburger buns. REALLY??? $300 a night and they can't do a hamburger right?  I appreciated the modern designs and look of the place, but the feel of it all just doesn't match.

This is my VERY first "build your own yogurt place" and I must admit that I LOVE it!!!!!  I got four different types of yogurt: oreo, vanilla bean, raspberry, and a "tart" one with sprinkles and all sorts of other goodies.... it was soooo delicious.  Plus we had a 1/2 off coupon.  I don't think it gets much better than that!!!!

This was the first time I left the dentist's office feeling better than when I went in!  I am not exaggerating when I say that I usually hate going the dentist.  I hate the air vacuum that dries up your mouth, I hate the water that sprays indirectly all over your face, I hate the sounds when they're cleaning you're teeth, I hate how your jaw hurts for the following week because of "opening wide" for x-rays, and I hate how the dentist talks to the assistants about your teeth in all sorts of code like you don't deserve to hear what's going on with YOUR teeth.  With all of these things to despise about going to the dentist, I am surprised to be writing that I actually enjoyed my experience at Simply Dentistry.  Dr. Tran and the assistant both spent 5 minutes getting to know me, sans any forced, awkward conversation. They were friendly, gave me a tour of the office, asked what kind of mouthwash I like, and didn't make me feel bad for procrastinating on my cleanings.  Dr. Tran is understanding, friendly, and incredibly good at what she does. Both the assistant and her were patient, explained what they were doing, and seemed genuinely interested in making my experience as comfortable as possible.  If you're looking for a dentist, Dr. Tran at Simply Dentistry is top notch.  Her office is green and eco friendly, there is a ceiling-mounted tv to keep you distracted, and she'll make jokes and share stories along the way.

I've never actually stayed here, but I frequently grab a drink or meet friends here! They have great "loungy" areas inside and the patio is small, quaint, and comfy. The music always fits my mood, somehow, and the service is very friendly and upbeat.   The bar itself is worth the trip - it looks like granite but it changes colors! Call me crazy, but I am so easily distracted whenever I am here.   Love it.

Dear Yogurtland,  You are my truest love in Arizona. You always manage to satisfy. You can cheer me up when I am down. You make me crave the perfectly sweet, but not overdone flavors and toppings. You make me fall in love all over again, every time.  Your employees are friendly and adorable. Your flavors are just the right amount of sweet and tangy. Your toppings are always fresh, clean, and crunchy. Your fruit-flavored water always quenches my thirst. Your yogurt is to die for.  I especially love your perfectly sweet Tart because it mixes with anything. I love when you have Mint because it is my favorite color green. I love how I can shamelessly enjoy the NY Cheesecake. I love your seasonal, delicious, fruity flavors! I love your juicy kiwi and strawberry toppings.  I just love you, Yogurtland!!!!
