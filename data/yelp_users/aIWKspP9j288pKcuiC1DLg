I came for a wash and oil change, was sold over the phone for a fluid flush and change for steering and brake fluid. Then a monsoon storm rolled in and the store closed early. I live right down the street and was expecting a call when my car was ready, but it became clear after a few hours that no one was calling me. Apparently they closed due to the storm and when I showed up to pick up my car no one knew who I was or what my car was there for. It took 4 employees and 20 minutes to find my keys and the car was not washed, I'm not even 100% sure the fluids were changed. After paying over $250 I had some trouble getting them to not charge me for the wash. I will never come back here again, even though they are right down the street and have always used them for car washes. VERY POOR SERVICE!!!!!!

I have enjoyed everything I have ordered from this place, the food is always cooked well and presented tastefully.  Last time I was here I had the French Onion Burger, it was one of the better gourmet burgers I've had in a long time. These guys do a great job with baking, so the burger bun (brioche) held up like a champ and did not fall apart, despite the burger being loaded.   Green Chile Pork is delicious, fried egg on top is (in my opinion) the only way to try it.   Baked goat cheese is a perfect appetizer.  Moroccan Meat Balls were great, the plate was much bigger than I thought it would be.   I look forward to the next time I'm here!

I'm not an expert on Peruvian food, but I thought the food here was really good. Service left a lot to be desired, as there are only about 6 or 7 tables in the place and somehow it still took our server over 5 minutes to bring us water and about 30 minutes to put our order in. What could have been a 35-45 minute meal turned into over 1 hour... not sure if I'll be back.

I like this place for its' location and ambiance. The staff has always been very friendly and knowledgeable and the food has always been above average. Just about my only complaint is their "seat yourself" policy, which can create a bad experience if you are with a large party or if the place is crowded.    Overall I would recommend this place, nice beer selection and solid food with great atmosphere.

My father and I stopped in for a quick dinner and we were very satisfied with this place. Complementary chips and salsa if you dine in is a nice touch and you have your choice of three salsas, all of which are great. I had a braised brisket taco with green chiles and the pastor taco, both were delicious. My dad had the steak carne asada burrito, the meat was tender and flavorful and the burrito didn't fall apart.   I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu, definitely recommend!!

Loved the food, location, and I especially loved the cocktail list. The BEST charcuterie board I have ever had!

My new favorite restaurant! I've been twice in the last week and can't wait to come back. Fried green tomatoes are great, the pimento cheese that comes with is so good I could eat it by itself! First I had the cider brined pork loin, served with whipped sweet potatoes and collard greens. I found this dish to be best when all three elements are eaten together rather than separately. For dessert I had the bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. This is basically a thick piece of French toast with bourbon caramel sauce, all plates were cleaned.   Second visit I had the fried okra (along with fried green tomatoes) and the blackened flat iron steak. This steak is a nice thick cut served with buttered succotash and marble potatoes. This is an amazing dish with great flavors and was perfectly cooked by the chef.   As for the building itself, I love the way it was remodeled and decorated (outside you can still see the original Beef Eaters stained concrete). The patio is comfortable, large, and has a nice fireplace.   I cannot wait to come back to try the fried chicken, meatloaf, catfish cioppino and the duck.  **UPDATE**  I have now had a chance to try the cioppino and the fried chicken. The cioppino was great, the catfish was cooked well with a nice corn meal breading. The cioppino was thicker, not too soupy, with large chunks of deep red tomatoes with a nice amount of acidity.   The fried chicken was great, the breading was thicker and was a little over-cooked but I will definitely be ordering it again.
