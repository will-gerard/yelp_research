I'm seriously impressed, took my mom's Accord which sits in the sun everyday for the past 7 years in which the paint job has some serious oxidation (and unfortuantely some of the top coat where the sun hits the most is already gone).    In 3 hrs (quoted 1.5hrs but this car was in bad shape), the Exterior Detailing package was worth every penny.  The car looks shiny, like if I redid the paint job vs abusing the poor car in the AZ sun.  Their package is much cheaper than anyone else's and puts Danny's orbital wax to shame($$$, what I did 4 years ago, the last time I got my hands on mom's car).  No pushy windshield chip people either (chills).  They kindly offered to drive me to the Arizona Center... don't do it, that place is dead and all outdoors (not fun in muggy July), ask to be dropped off somewhere else, even if it's a Starbucks down the street for wifi.

You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.  I love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated.

As a first time puppy owner, you buy too much to figure out what you need.  What I am glad to have bought here:  1.  Grandma's Bitter Apple Spray (only used it a few times to keep the pups from chewing wires and furniture legs but glad to have it on hand)  2.  Pizzles (Costco is cheaper by bulk)  3.  Nature's Miracle (my godson had a bloody nose on the dog beds, and this worked better than Resolve.. I'm going to start using it on my clothes.  Also use it inside the kennels post rinse.)   4.  if you like Kongs and its snacks, best pricing here  5.  The large tufted bedding, it's machine washable and b/c I get the larger sizes, it doesn't throw my washing machine off balance.  6.  Really HUGE cow leg bones or knuckles (search hard).  I have them cut into 2-3 pieces at home, pups gnaw on them forever.

Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it.

Always enjoyable, great ambience... and the folks are kind, even when I brought el cheapo wines when I first started eating here...  We come a few times a year for the past 4 years... if the menu rotated more often w/ variety (not just changing from fish dish A to fish dish B), we'd certainly increase the visits.  Especially love the interesting cheeses plate (more or less the same combo as far as I can tell these past few yrs) and the pate!

This is the go to place (almost by default I will kindly say) for the traditional Asian fruit layer cake served at basically any wedding / birthday / "insert-Chinese-event" here in the valley.  Taiwanese owned, this family has been at it for years.  I don't often get to their store location, but when I do, I pickup the custard cream puffs (not sweet, oddly chewy puffs) and enjoy their different steamed white buns in the bottom case.  But I've certainly consumed several of their cakes over the years in the Valley...

I'm breaking my default 3 star furniture store rule as I made no purchase, but this place is impressive.  Bookmarked after Sarah K reviewed, I'm glad I made the looooooong trek to N. Phx (not too hard if you get off the 101)... there's a huge variety of furniture w/ some bargain prices.  If you've shopped around, prices in your head start getting reset higher (furniture conspiracy?), so coming to this place is refreshing where prices seem at the most reasonable and w/out worrying if the furniture will fall apart.  The claim is this is model home staging furniture to be cleared out.  Until my home is furnished, I'll make a point to swing by to see how the inventory changes and snag me a good deal.

4 stars because when the weather is good in the Valley, we should be outdoors eating in a shaded pecan grove... rather than playing on the Wii or walking inside the mall.  Came here for a baby shower hosted by another... so I haven't tried the full monty for food, but it's in my mind for any event I might have to host...

The only draw here is the view of the city lights.  I used to kiss the boys here in the parking lot during college, but now that I can pay to eat here... it ain't all that.  The music is way too loud, we could not talk or hear each other with a group of 8.  And you definitely get 'tourist' feel, especially when you see the buses pull up... though luckily they seat them in an adjoining room away from view.  Get the cutesy steer horn paper hat from the hostess, it was sort of the highlight for our table.  That said, 'nuff said.

While at ASU, I ate here all the time w/ then Hong Kong boyfriend.  He's many years gone, but the restaurant remains in my heart... I've bounced all over the menu over the years, these are the must trys:   #263 Two BBQ Combo Rice Plate:  The BBQ chef is a genius, it's the best Chinese bbq in town -- I go for the roasted white pork and roasted duck, passing on the red BBQ pork.  The rice plate (vs the app) comes w/ sauteed cabbage and natural sauce from the roasted duck... oh my yum.  #172  Spicy Green Beans with Minced Pork:  not spicy at all, eat it as soon as they place the dish on the table.. so you get the 'breath of the wok' before it disappears...  #202  Beef Chow Fun w/ Egg Sauce:  wide white rice noodles with a saucy soft egg sauce w/ beef.  Eat with the Siracha or hot oil sauce...  #220  Seafood Chow Mein, upgraded HK Style Pan Fried Noodles: DO THE UPGRADE for the crispy yellow egg noodles.  Comes with scallops, tiger shrimp and calamari...the sauce soaks into the noodles, and it's delicious!

Pregnancy cravings!  BEST Chinese roast duck (sui op) and roasted white pork (sui yuk) in town.  I live down the street from Phoenix Palace, but I make the drive here.  In the appetizer section, you can order the 2 BBQ combination.  In the rice plate section, you can choose one of the plates and it comes with rice and some vegetables.  NOM NOM NOM.

I never considered that the offerings might differ from store to store, so here's my tip:  for knob pulls and handles, there is a larger variety in this location than the Alma School/Chandler crossroad site.  I'm a HD girl myself, people are always friendly and make a point to help me out as I ogle or stare glassy at something.  If you don't find a home decor item in the style you want, won't hurt to ask if there is a greater variety at another location.

If you read my Sherwin Williams revew re: screw top lid awesomness, HD's Behr sample cans also are screw top for $3 each.  OMG... I am going to do all my samples here for testing.  Only comes in flat finish though.  BenjMoore couldn't sample, so I had to spend $17 for a quart of paint I didn't like (anyone need Pottery Barn's Sparkling Wine?).

My fave place for Vietnamese...  also being Chinese myself, I adore won ton and I can combine my love for noodle soup and won ton here.  #22 is my fave for pork/shrimp won ton and noodle soup (#23 is more won tons, no noodles... might be a new tactic for the 3 of us, get 2 bowls of #22 and 1 bowl of #23 and divvy the noodles and won tons accordingly).  Their broth is very good, not oily and greasy on top, and something I'm willing to sup down with edible ingredients (I tend to leave broth in the bowl at pho shops).  In the summer, I always get one of the refreshing "desserts" which I really treat like cooling drinks... the seaweed or longon versions.

Soggy and bland deep dish pizza?  Dry crumbly brownie dessert?  2nd chance for redemption, I think not.  They did have several bottled root beers to choose from, but I wouldn't pour it into the glass they give you besides.. I'm sure it's not normal, but mine had that old dishwater taste.

Never never liked Mexican food growing up, until my NM transplanted friend took me here.  No other joint has touched this place in my heart.  --Hatch green sauce, there is nothing like it... --Chips and 4 dips and sauces, omg. --Cheese enchilada plate (better than the chicken), chicken tacos or the flautas. omg x2. --Sopapillas, omg omg omg.  It does not get better than this.  Any out of towner who wants to try (NM) Mexican food, I take them here!

SEVERAL years ago, this was the place to grab dim sum.  But much better have popped up and the crowds moved on, and this fell to the wayside.  You can tell easily by the lack of (Asian) customers.  On a whim, tried it again.  Meh.  Egg tarts were the best part, but there is so much better dim sum not much farther away.

Besides all the typical reasons that I can find all the Asian goodies and fresh seafood, it's really an INTERNATIONAL market.  I travel out of country every year, so I make a point to hit the aisles beforehand so I know what I don't have to bring back... Being a crazy food collector, I need to save some baggage space for non-perishable souvenirs.    I'm seriously tempted to take digital pictures of the food aisle representing the country I go to next... we brought back a few brands of yerba mate from Buenos Aires... taking away precious space from their version of dulce de leche... Lee Lee's had every brand of that funky drink at home!

The new home is going to be repainted in several rooms, and the painter prefers Dunn Edwards.  I was going nuts to/fro trying to coordinate color samples to the some of the current colors in the home.  Finally I asked if I may borrow (have?  they said i could borrow for as long as I like) a palette deck...  This deck is 4-5 inches tall, my gosh there has to be more colors for sure in this deck than in the itty bitty store display (disappointing when I first saw it).  So extra star for their generousity and now I feel good there are several colors to choose from... if I can't find some core colors in here, then for sure I'm hella picky.

WTF... half an hour total to get a color match paint in an empty store?  Even my friend got testy with the whole experience (that says alot when a completely uninvolved person is annoyed).  The lady brings the can to the back area, and I hear her chatting away forever, until I start haunting the employee area does the can actually get to me.  And then she forgot to tell them the original formula was 125% strength, which I'm trying to figure out if she did it right.  She snatches the can from me just as I'm trying to validate the old vs new label, and I don't see her again for 10 min... and she never comes back out to tell me if the formula was right or wrong.  I'm just left hanging around w/ no other avail employee (someone else actually walked in)  to at least ask pls followup w/ the lady in the back, who I can still hear chatting away w/ the paint matcher guy.  Seriously poor customer service.  Worst part, they did not mix a new can of paint... just squirted in 25% more tint and slapped another label on the can...chinzy and it was her error.  I went to Dunn Edwards (vs my standby) cuz I needed to color match what the original home owner's used, but no screw top lid + poor customer service = not coming back when I'm applying new paint.

Read everyone else's review if you want the "I know it's a chain but..."  I do really like Mimi's Cafe!  I come here only 2-3 times a year, but my feet hop-skip-to-it when it does.  1.  Love their carrot raisin bread (google it, you can make it too) 2.  When I'm ill, sometimes I only want to eat is their french onion soup and the white rolls dipped in it 3.  When I'm craving liver (heckle me, it's ok)... well this place wins as a default cuz who else serves it?! 4.  Brunch is great especially for the money (last time it came with fresh squeezed OJ) 5.  Just tried their $9.99 Lunch 2-course menu, the grilled shrimp and asparagus was very good.  Beat my expectations!

I have no clue why I was expecting zen-like music or a Japanese bamboo deer scarer water fountain... but instead found jazz music with 2 non-Asian sushi chefs.  I shouldn't judge, I make an awesome spaghetti carbonara.  Ask the chef what he'd recommend for the day off the white board.  The sushi & sashimi is uber fresh and probably the best in the E.V., with the kampachi (Hawaiian yellowtail) being the fave... delicate taste and firm flesh (doesn't mushy fish gross you out??).  Next time I'd save my $ on the toro to get more kampachi!  The rolls were great, Big & Spicy and Futomaki!  That said, I'd stay away from the panko anything.  We did the assorted platter -...worst.deep.fried.Japanese.ever.  The oil tasted old or the panko off (is that even possible?), but we had the gamut of salmon, pork chop, vegs, a shrimp and oyster... it was just plain bad.  You're going here for sushi and sashimi, stick with it!

Searching high and low for Spanish ingredients, I would pick up an odd or end here and there ... and there isn't much in the Valley, so I mostly ordered online...but AJ's was the best one stop shop locally for imports from Spain:  1.  Bomba rice for paella 2.  Variey of tinned items - squid, octopus, tuna, sardines 3.  Three varieties of hard chorizo, including hot 4.  Assortment of sherry vinegars 5.  Tortas de aceite - olive oil tortas (this version was rosemary flavor) 6.  $$$ 2-3 Spanish cheeses, ie. manchego is easy to find but this quality was nicer than Costco, TJ, F&E if you're really willing to spend $17-20/lb  Sur La Table in the same plaza also has a few items.

Currently my fave Thai, and I regularly go to the one in Flagstaff after a day of snowboarding (ok that isn't sooo often).  At lunch I go for the pad thai w/ soft tofu, #2 spicy, egg ok.  My vegetarian pals love the joint as well.  BTW, if noodles sound a bit heavy today, the Mee krob appetizer is like the pad thai w/ the egg & shrimp but with the airy crispy white noodles w/ sweet sauce to hold it together.  Dinner I go for the regular pad thai and the steamed fish.  The curries are tasty but small portions.

I forgot how much I like Kona, having gone to several throughout the valley especially for reverse happy hour in Scottsdale.  The patio at the Chandler location is really chill.  Jalapeno yellowtail sushi and salmon wasabi sashimi are awesome from the Chef's menu... I'm so glad someone else ordered it during Happy Hour, cuz my cheap toosh probably wouldn't have.  Sooo good, will order those next time and eat it all for myself!

My coworker likes to eat here when we're at the mall over lunch, and honestly, the place had to grow on me (seriously half a year).  I've worked out my formula -- a half sandwich (winner: roast beef gorg) and a pastry or dessert (winner: palmier but I'm working thru the ho hum case).  What has won me over:  fresh, chewy breads, the mgr who is bussing tables alongside the rest of the staff, the bussers themselves are friendly, a microwave if you have to heat up small kid's food, even a courtesy phone!  They really try to make your whole experience pleasant... the level of detail to customer orientation is pretty amazing, it's all in small ways but adds up.   Actually the phone is what gave it the 4th star... it's just soooo... courteous.  Goodness forbid I'm without my cell or the battery is dead, but I will appreciate that phone is there one day.. I'm sure.

I am such a freakin' troll here... I always swing by any W&S location and check out what their food and kitchen items are for sale... they run great deals...  I collect food when I travel, and it's nice to find them here: 1.  Maldon salt -- if you have bought into the sea salt craze (really it does taste different straight on the tongue than regular table salt  http://www.slate.com/id/2117243/), try this English version 2.  La Salamandra dulce de leche -- if you like caramel coffees, try this as your sweetener.  The best brand I found in Buenos Aires... 3.  W&S truffle mayo -- omg this is good w/ french fries 4.  Panettone -- beautiful red tin only during the Xmas holidays, glaceed chestnuts (holy crap this is $$$ in Europe)... need I say more.

I'm repainting an entire house... little paint chips sometimes just don't do it.  Flip thru the PB catalog and paint colors are listed, but also you can go to their stores (inclu the PB Kids next door), and the walls itself will identify which paint color from Benjamin Moore they are using.  The stores also have the current season's paint fan decks, free for the taking.  Awesomeness.

Handsdown, Anthro is my favorite store ...  every major city I'm in, I map out Anthro to see what is in their sales racks.... Boston, Chicago, SF, Austin..etc etc.  This is the closet of a roommate I've never had, she is so decadent cool w/out flaunting it.  Always adored the sales rack, but most recently the finds have been for home area... knobs, pulls, face plates for light switches as we refurbish a new home...

It took a year for an Italian joint to accidentally spill the beans on their tiramisu source cuz they wanted me to purchase via them... some lackey let it slip.  It's my absolute favorite, and it's Honey Moon's!  Then an old flame actually surprised me w/ an ENTIRE tiramisu cake (the scroll and fruit topping is std and beautiful), and I've been dying to come to their storefront since then.  Passed it accidentally today and made my current flame throw gears into reverse (I kid you not) and back into their parking lot.  I'll pay the prices for their dessert... lemon meringue (oh my yum), mini lime tartlet, fruit tarlet (oh my yum x 2), and a choc almond tort for later.  If you bake and you bake w/ quality ingredients, you know making from scratch is not cheap.  I'm willing to pay for goodies I won't make myself....  some girls mani & pedi, I splurge on eats...

I just want to park myself in this orange and brown blob of a place and stay and forget the world outside.  And not knowing what it is to experience doughnut nirvana before, it is here.  It is here with the plain sugar doughnut.  Very very friendly counter service.  And they have vanilla creamer if you ask.  I've seen this place for 20 years and only started stopping here in the past few months.  Amazing that I will go to little dives off Roadfood dot com everywhere else in the country, and it took me this long to go to the one right in my old hood.

I thought I was just the uncool kid not in-the-know.. but I quickly scanned the reviews and didn't see anyone mention... Rock Spring's Cafe HOGS N HEAT!!!  Every first Sat of the month, it's all you can eat BBQ at their outdoor patio (you can't see this HUGE patio / BBQ smoker area from the freeway)  with live music... bikers mixed w/ families and obviously those in the know.  Apparently they do it all year, hot or cold... but the weather is sooo awesome right now, I'm rating it 4 stars for only decent bbq but relaxing atmosphere and toe tappin' muzak.  I don't know if it's a regular thing, but there were $1 pie slices for charity.. .the peach crumb rocks!

If you're not a makeup junkie, this one will be hard to follow.  ;)  When I hit pan on the Cinema Secrets Kit #1 palette (great for NC25), I wanted to try out a few other stage makeups and hopefully w/out blindly ordering off the Internet.  Easley's has the complete lineup of Ben Nye testers of their foundations and concealers, and the cool dude was providing me handiwipes as I was swatching colors.  Unfortunately no Graftobian palettes, my wishlist item.  No returns, so swatching was a great way to checkout the lineup... fyi, the Ben Nye Shinsei line is specifically designed for Asian skintones.

If you're going to be grabbing a Copenhagen piece, it is always worth to swing by the clearance center and see if it's avail here.  Another tip, since you're bargain shopping anyways, I've seen many of their pieces on Craigslist for Phx and Tucson area....    Coming from the East Valley, I take Grand's Camelback/43rd Ave exit, it looks like I can't take the left onto 43rd (no left sign there), so I always cut into the Home Depot parking lot to get onto 43rd...

Bring your checkbook, because you are going to pay handsomely for these doors.  This certainly is no review for a steal of the century, but here's my tips:  1.  It's 2010, hurry up and get the door before the Federal energy tax credits expire (up to 30% or $1500 max)  2.  You can custom order the door thru Lowe's for the same mfg leadtime which is cheaper than Pella direct (b/c they want to make money in the install), OR you can use your contractor's ROC license to purchase at a discounted rate which makes it cheaper or on par.  3.  We went all out, cellular blinds in btwn glass + screen doors... the French doors is probably my favorite feature of my home and I obnoxiously point them out to e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e (don't you LOVE the doors?!).  We did not just spend thousands renovating our home, to put in a cheap dinky door.  4.  If nothing else, listen to me... PAINT THE FRAMING BEFORE THE INSTALL.  if you're getting new framing done, paint the trim (yourself or contractor) before installing!  I was grumbling to myself the entire time, when I was taping the area off... it's hard to not get paint on the door and fit the tape over the tight spaces where the door swings on.  Go stare at the floor model doors and you'll get what I mean.

Uh... wow.  If I ever decide to go Martha Stewart beserk and upholster furniture or make my own drapes, I would come here.  Meanwhile this place was a suggestion from a flooring store.  I swung by to purchase a linoleum remnant (sold out back) to put under our new puppy's pen.

The counter lady was uber nice, letting the three of us sample the ice cream flavors.  The rum raisin was my favorite, but the textures from the ice cream consistantly was a little gummy.  And the bright food colorings reminds me of being at a happy circus but, perhaps in my old age, I prefer things a little more au natural.

Aug is the start of New Mexico Hatch chili season!  My go to spot for Hatch chilies, though many places sell it... Food City sells the 1 bushel bags (~25-30lbs) in mild/medhot/hot or already roasted outside in the parking lot.  No guessing, wondering what you're getting.  If you buy bushels such as I, let the cashier know so they will charge you appropriately (10cents more per lb) and the guy outside will roast for you w/ receipt.  Roasting at home is a long and tedious process when you're talking 30-60 lbs of chilies on a normal grill.  I personally like to mix a bag of mild and medium to freeze for an entire year of green chili goodness.  Don't forget to pickup the cojita cheese and crema as well, apparently Food City is award winning for their corn and flour tortillas which this location does make on site.  Sometimes I purchase some of their watery fresh fruit juices if it's avail as I walk in.  Worst case if the chilies are out, you can go across the street for already roasted and bagged (about double in price) but you don't know what spice level chili you're buying.. so ask if you can sample.

Oysters.  That's all there is to it, 15 deep fried oysters.  That is all I want, that is all I order.  Of all the P* Fish and Chips, this breading is the thinnest... I was thinking it was all pre-fabbed, but now reading Jared A's review, perhaps the secret is hand breading!

Pregnancy cravings!  They say your body knows when it needs nutrients, and there's time when I just need to eat liver or oysters (I'm guessing iron right?).  Liver is rare and out of fashion, so I precall my order in to avoid the wait... and then crunch down on the 10 or 15 pc oysters ALL BY MY LONESOME.  nom nom nom.

I've come here many a time straight off a hike off Camelback Mtn, so yeah, my buddies and I certainly ain't looking pretty.  Never felt slighted.  I always get the Quick Start Conscious Breakfast, depending on someone else to order the dessert style breakfasts (Cinn Challah w/ fresh berries.. mmmm) to snag a few forkfuls from there...   Today was a first for lunch.. the place was so relaxing and never felt rushed.  The turkey wrap was surprisingly good (not healthy boring), and the sweet potato fries should be the std for all such fries in the valley.  OMG.. I'm ordering that as a side forever more here.

For MONTHS, we did not know there was a menu... just ordering off the 3-4 specials listed on the chalkboard.  OMG.. once we knew, we go every other week driving up from Chandler.  LOVE this place as a dairy intolerant person.

This place has been here for YEARS... my first time was at least in 2000.  1/4 grilled beef + extra flour tortilla is less than $6.    I find the chicken dry and sometimes the steak might be over cooked... immediately move those slices into the salsa fresca and let them marinate, as you build your tortilla like tacos one by one.  So good!

You already know how you feel about TJ's, so are you really reading reviews to see what others think?  Food voyeur that I am, I google around to see what others are recommending.  My buys: 1.  Wines ... google "jasonswineblog" for his infamous TJ's Top 10 2.  Rittersport... dark choc w/ hazelnuts, $2/bar beats all other except sales might match 3.  Rumford baking powder... alum free, why not, it can't hurt 4.  Haricot vert... when Costco's fresh version is much too large in size, these are petite 5.  Mozzarella balls... large or small 6.  Gingerroos... I can't duplicate the deliciousness of these cookies for either taste or cost...mmmm.... 7.  Choc croissants... wow, really it's like having a mini bakery at home 8.  Gorgonzola gnocchi... we add in our own homemade frozen pesto or shrimp and peas, it's our emergency meal 9.  Wild Mushroom and Truffle Pizza... buy this in bulk  I suspect many shop here b/c they like the TJ's feel of semi-exclusitivity or belonging to some insiders club.. I've found my share of loser products here, but admit it, there is a few items you just love to get here too.    It's no (public) secret they are owned by a German corp (http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/20/news/companies/inside_trader_joes_full_version.fortune/)... and I've always been amused by general product recalls which also list TJ's as impacted... then it dawns here is another bulk supplier buying the same recalled nuts as Walmart and Costco, but are you blaming TJ's for finding a successful marketing niche that works.   The employees seem enthusiastic about the products they sell and contribuate to an overall warm feeling to the store... so a happy family (faceless corp or not) is just good business.

Wub wub wuuuub AZ88 b/c: 1.  Never been rushed, EVER in the years I've been going here.   2.  And we spend alot of time enjoying the Burger Au Poivre (peppery and wine-y) + Picnic Chicken + St Petersburg app 3.  Out of towners staying in OldTown, this is walking distance for them for a meetup. 4.  Drinks are Scottsdale prices, but the food for sure is not... a great deal for this chill atmosphere!   Is the over diligent Give-Money-for-Pet-Charity man still lurking in the parking garage??  I've stopped parking there a few years ago for the Buckboard parking lot -- dude, I love helping out but that little old man was worse than a used car salesman...

Whenever I'm about to hop onto an airplane (do you want your last meal to be crap plane food?), going snowboarding or hiking for the day... this is my go to place to grab a sandwich for the pack.    Grilled pork w/out the "mayo" when it's being packed away (is it really mayo??).  Sometimes the fried 5 egg roll deal comes on the trip too.  Hot summer days is nice to sip on an iced chrysanthemum tea with black grass jelly.  BTW I saw a location just a few miles from Disneyland, if you're planning to pack in a little there too.

It's one of those mixed blessings.. do you eat/sample at the Farmer's Market or eat breakfast here first and then feel too full to impulse buy from the market later...  But if I'm driving 1/2 hr from EV to hit Phoenix's Farmer's Market, then it is totally worth the stop here.  This place is an awfully darn good breakfast joint that sources from locals... the last time I checked:  Bacon -- the Pork Shop in QC Jams -- Cotton Country Jams Coffee -- C4 aka Cave Creek Coffee Company Breads -- MJ (drool)

Came to a humbling realization of how arbitrary reviews can be.  Freak experience, random event, whatever..c'mon, it DOES affect our reviews... and apparently for me, temperature!  Got a random assortment - scone, tea cookies, peanut butter bar, brownie, apple bar + loaf of bread.  Driving home in our warm weather and letting the goods rest on the counter, everything tasted ok.  Good but no-rock-the-world great... though the apple bar frosting was resplendent in vanilla flavor (yes, big word for big frosting!).  We just sampled thru everything and packed the remains into the fridge.  From there, a magical transformation occurred... cold temps firmed up those heavily butter laden goods... the peanut butter bar and brownie elevated from enjoyable goods to luxurious pleasures.  PS.  All my heart and stars, if nothing else, goes for love of MJ's Bread!

FINALLY... I found our go-to pho place in the West side.  Excellent portion sizes for the price, ton of menu items, and airy atmosphere (good chance you won't smell like the food when you leave).  Only went here once, but definitely good enough to rate it now.  Food updates after a few more eats.

Now I know how non-Asians feel inside Lee Lee's...and the best part?  They sold me pure fat for 0.99cents a lb (best to call ahead, though I caught them in the middle of a butchering and they happen to have a slab handy to chop for me immediately), which is wonderful for adding into your own homemade sausages.  I used to purchase the fat pre-pckgd at Lee Lee's but could no longer find it in the past year, so I am glad to have discovered this place!

When an avid cook tried to tell me about Penzey's, I wrote it off as the Mary Kay of spices... until a year later, she took me.  I've been hooked since.. the pricing is much better than the McCormicks in the grocery stores though not as good as bulk from LeeLee's or an ethnic Middle Eastern market for example.  I keep going back, b/c I've gone OCD building Penzey bottles and bags collection.  I've justified the bulk bag purchases by buying their mini empty jars and creating spice gift baskets for house warmings and birthdays... it's a sick and wonderful obession.  My faves: Smoked Paprika -- buy this now, buy in bulk. Sunny Paris -- great on eggs and also baked sweet potato fries (doused w/ olive oil and smoked paprika) Shallot Salt -- ok I just sniff it, I can't really taste the shallot Ginger -- for holiday baking Fennel -- I've never seen seeds this green elsewhere

It is just dismal those few times you want something to eat at the coffee house, and your choices are sad breakfast offerings or overpriced bakery items.  But I am vouching for Steve's food!... bacon, jalepeno & cheese frittata (w/ thin sliced potatoes as the bottom layer) as well as the ham & cheese stuffed brioche!  You do have to heat yourself.. luckily the microwave does have power settings, so go PL-7 or 8 to avoid overcooking as you heat.    These guys are open early (5:30am M-F and 6:30am S-S)... so this is going to be my new go to place to grab some food when I have an early morning  flight or roadtrip.

If I could close my eyes and eat with chopsticks w/out stabbing myself, I could pretend this was dinner while on vacation...   The waitress was gracious, immediately sharing recommendations when she learned it was our first visit.. and continued to help us thru as we ordered addtl dishes later.  The dishes were visually presented such as in a high end restaurant and I don't think pricing is out of line at all for this style of food (Japanese IS expensive).  The garlic miso clams in risotto was so clever in presentation and extremely rich and savory (cilantro alert!).  We just enjoyed our meal from beginning to end.

It figures it would take me 7 yrs before I go to the empty strip mall down the steet, right before I move out of the neighborhood to try this place.    IT'S GOOD.  Got a red pizza with sausage with a great fennel taste and mushrooms.  The crust... geez, it's good.  Definitely better than Rosati's and a few others in the area...

Contrary to everyone else, we really enjoyed our free movie experience.  Super friendly grand opening staff ... almost bordering on Disney-esque enthusiasm. Hope the energy stays on!  We definitely would come here again, larger seating, quieter atmosphere due to 18+ age group, and decent dining without scary airport-like pricing (entrees $8.99-12.99)...  Food quality is Applebee's level, so set expectations accordingly...  Chicken tenders - run of the mill normal strips, no hint of coconut but there was the odd ponzu sauce.  Battered shrimp - received 7 large tender (not overcooked) shrimp, better but the ponzu sauce is corn syrup scary.  Allowed me to sub the typical fries for a small side salad (romaine).  Chicken fried steak - ok, came w/ hearty portion of mashed red potatoes and snap peas.  Smokey salmon sandwich - would order this again, came with chips  Triple berry stack - unmemorable  Chocolate brownie and ice cream - warm and delicious

My favorite dim sum in the East Valley... generally the best of the best rotates every other year... as chef's move or some new hot shot comes in from Cali or HK...  for the moment.. it's here!  Another cool part is that, though not as fresh by the time you take it to go, is you could order dim sum off the menu... or on the right as you enter, some of the dim sum is there ready for you to take home for an impromtu meal or snack.  Haven't done dinner here yet, sort of scared too in case the dishes don't live up to the spectucular yum of its dim sum!

Return trip this time for dinner and brought a new tastebud (aka boyfriend).  Ok seriously, amazing friendliness from the cashier girl.. she leaves the register since we were standing a distance away while we decide on the menu and comes up to talk to us...I asked what she suggested but told her I'm decided on the Cubana and bf is up in the air... she had the that's-a-nice-torta-but kind of look and then proceeded to try to describe a crunchy taco and its filling.  It didn't interest bf, so he went with a classic burrito filled w/ pork (pastor).  While we're waiting at a table, the cashier lady (who turns out to be the server and busser later) nonchalantly swings by and drops off in front of each of us a crunchy taco filled with potatoes dressed with red sauce and white crumbled cheese.  With a very surprised thanks, we got to them... OMG, from now on I'm ordering these Taco Durados (only 99cents each!).  Later when we tried to thank her again, she was quietly pleased and told us they come in either beef, bean or potato.  Probably will be my next meal.  Classic burrito w/ pork reminded me of bacos mixed with rice. The Cubano could of been good (salty but forgiveable, it's breaded steak, ham and who knows what else..I better be reasonable), but it was no match for the taco sample.    Definitely extra star now...we're excited to come again and what kind, friendly service to make us feel comfortable!

It's worthwhile if you're buying a pricey home item to check if BBB sells the same item online.  Online they don't take the 20% coupon, but you can go to the store to help you place the online order and receive the 20% off (expired coupon is ok too!).  I purchased the Wine Enthusiast branded fridge "online" at the store ( same retail price found anywhere else) with the 20% off plus free shipping promo going on currently... noone can touch the price.

Big 5 reminds me of Big Lots of sporting goods.. It's a bit jumbly and messy, and the quality is middle ground to low end.  So alot of the items here would be cheaper, fine if you want a headlamp that's just good enough to eat your meal in the dark while camping or cheap snowboarding gear to start with let's say...

If you are breaking down large amts of meat for freezing, Fry's sells freezer paper.  No luck at Target, Walmart, Costco, Bashas (where I try to do most of my grocery shopping in some effort to support local)...  PS.  The butterscotch muffin in the bakery section is sugar high good.

Not all Ace's are alike, as they are franchised.  I've been to some where it feels dead and the staff lacking, but this location has always been consistently helpful.  I pick an Ace for knowledge and helpfulness, b/c there is enough of them around I can be picky.  I come here:  1.  Sheer convenience of walking in/out 2.  When I can't find what I'm looking for at Lowe's or Home Depot -- Selection actually varies btwn the 3 stores (ie. metal shower drain thingy when you look down at your toes...).  3.  Paint colors (this franchised Ace doesn't carry the BenMoore Pottery Barn colors though)

Not for the young and stylin'.  I am not saying I fit either category, just warning you.  :)  If you're targeting the high end designers, look for the... 1.  small dedicated rack of (some well past their prime) shoes, ie. Gucci, Prada. 2.  purses locked up on the bicycle chain loop 3.  wallets under the counter glass

I know!  Why am I reviewing a chain sandwich shop... it's not that I'm reviewing this specific location, I'm here to expound the delight of the Veggie Max!  I've always ordered the Italian BMT but loaded w/ tons of veggies.. but an Indian veg friend clued me in to the Veggie Max (not the regular.. MAX).  Comes with veggie patties, which mentally and seems to be physically filling as well...     tip:  This sandwich isn't meant for saving and eating later... few hours later, my cold veg patty is as hard as a rock... not sure if I should wonder why...

The disclosure here this is great for shopping for guys... I don't even bother looking for myself or any other dept in this clearance center.  My bf has a very short tolerance for shopping so the gameplan is I quickly sift thru the very organized (kudos!) dress shirts and shorts.... hand my boyfriend 10-15 options, he picks out what he likes (that doesn't mean I don't empower him to pick out his clothes right?  :D  I prefer to call it a joint decision making process), and end result is painless shopping for great pricing and quality dress shirts for work and events.  $10-20 per, depending on what addtl % off sale is going on, we generally pick up Kenneth Cole / Hugo Boss / Perry Ellis / BCBG dress shirts.  (Near the inside mall entrance is the guy's long sleeved shirts in S/M/L and go deeper back twds the suits to get the fitted dress shirts for the higher end brand names).

Paid for termite service and over the 2 years, company has come out 3 times... the Termidor and foam does not appear to be effective.  Basically the termites have kept moving all around the house and reappearing elsewhere, rather than the termites ingesting the poison and supposedly kill the base colonies.  Of course there's alot of potential reasons they are suggesting such as maybe I'm dealing w/ multiple colonies (a NEW colony appears in another part of the house consistantly?  doubt it), new landscaping (no), or new builds (no, well established neighborhood of 10+ years).  The 2 year warranty is up of last week, and of course, there is a new termite tunnel now in another room of the house.  I would pay for the $99 renewal to extend service if I had faith in the product or services.  But now I'm especially concerned w/ the customer service, as I received alot of pushback from the office manager to speak with an "inspector" before they physically come out.  She was extremely argumentative and talking over me, insisting an inspector cannot speak to me via phone as they unable to "treat" over the phone.  Understanding that, I had to keep repeating I would like to discuss if there are new techniques, methods or chemicals as obviously the past 3 treatments were ineffective.  While she kept talking over me (at one point, I asked her to let me finish talking) and obviously would not listen (I finally was driven to talk over her), I simply kept restating the request for the "inspector" to call first so I can address concerns and set expectations.  That went on for a long time, seriously, is it that hard to ask for a phone call first?  Maybe for any reason termites are happily munching on my drywall to this day that is beyond this company's control (doesn't that make you feel confident?), but it's the extreme lack of customer service and care that has driven this to a 1-star review.

If you like babysitting, you will love working w/ them.  3 more visits, THREE!  #1:  The inspector of the East Valley turns out to be Paul the owner himself, so I (gently) chide him for not returning phone calls.  And I let him know my grievances (3 termite treatments and they are still eating my walls!) and my concerns w/ the mgr's customer service.  He apologizes, we have a nice looong chat (he's actually personable guy but does that mean the company is competent?  You'll have to decide for yourself)... and he agrees to treat the ENTIRE house (funny how I just came to realize the initial ~$500 only treated a portion, not the whole house) ..so I shell out another $99 to extend my warranty.  Yes I'm that nice.  Le'ts say I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that termites are THAT hard to treat and it's normal to treat in sections only (put down your raised eyebrows...)  #2:  The guys come, treat the entire house.  I leave for work, come back and noted they left an open trench on one side of my house and a few open holes drilled into my foundation.  Called and spoke w/ polite staffer with request to please finish the job.... apparently this wasn't a 2 day job, this was an apologetic "omg-I'm-so-sorry-we'll-send-someone-out".  #3:  I inspect after #2 (I have a day job, I can't babysit as much as I need to apparently).  Trench now is covered up.. but the exposed holes into my foundation still have not been filled in w/ cement.  Really?!  Please leave "Welcome Termite" sign.  Called again, talked to staff again.  Someone must of come out again and filled up the holes.  Final inspections, looks like the job is done.  I'm done too.

Chloe's is indy-owned now, bought by Sam Fox's former general manager.  Swung by 10min before a Sur La Table cooking class was due to start.  There was a to-go section of one lonely sandwich at 6pm Sat (so the good news is sales must be brisk), but we took the risk of ordering a hot sandwich = longer serve time (6-7min for a hot, 3-4 min for a cold.. I swear, I quote).  Though I teasingly hinted any expediting would be great (no other in line in front of us), I didn't see that communicated from the cashier to the gal making the hot pastrami and swiss.  Can I really fault them, no probably not.  And really, the cashier guy was uber nice from beginning to end.  I asked them to wrap the 2 halves separately for sharing, and it was a tasty pastrami.  The casual patio atmopshere will definitely have me come back when I have time for a sit down.

The husband / wife / dogs are knowlegeable and friendly... they will continue to offer tons of advice if you keep asking.  Exotic varieties.. they also had the same brand (Dave Wilson) and some other unique variety of the fruit trees found at Bakers.  I kept staring at a 3 variety peach tree w/ low chill hours, but alas we already picked up our trees a few wks ago.  Good luck to our baby avocado tree, and I better not catch you Yelpers picking the fruit off (in a few years)!  :D

D&B has Wednesday Havana Nights on their roof top patio!  With temps dropping down, it was great to start the free lesson at 7p followed with dancing at 8p.  Most of the crowd is probably the ASU salsa class and friends, as its their instructor leading the lesson.  That said, it is a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere... I didn't see any of the die hard salseros, so perhaps they left this venue for the newer, fresher crowd.  Great place to take beginners to medium level.  DJ also played bachata!!!

I'm rounding up to 4 stars because they were nice enough to split our dishes, as I really enjoy eating in courses (wish-I-was-in-Italy-poser).  I'd have given a full four stars, but they forgot it was my boyfriend's birthday (noted at the time the reservation was made)...  I am not going to be one of THOSE people (except for pointing it out in yelp reviews...har).  Starter:  Scheiner's sausage pizza, love they are supporting local purveyor's (ok who isn't?).  I'd come back just b/c this kicks Sauce's around the corner from here. Primi:  Gnocchi w/ veal, great flavor and tender shredded meat.  Disconcerting was the equally tender gnocchi, little mushy. Secondi:  Sea bream with broccoli rabe and polenta.  They respect their fish. Dessert:  didn't go there, was way too full.  And thanks again for graciously letting us split our plates and eat in courses!

Anyone searching for seating benches?  Trying to add one to an already existing (expandable) dining table, so that you can have more space when necessary since you don't want to add more random chairs (or store them)?  Dual use, we can push the bench to an empty wall to decoratively hold books or odds n' ends when not in dining holiday use...    It's a difficult search!... the best options were Cost Plus (limited, smaller sizes), Pottery Barn (most variety, finishes and sizes), and finally ending our hunt at Crate and Barrel (beautiful solid wood, mult sizes)!

Sitting at one end of the motel(?)-converted-strip-mall adjacent to Buffalo Exchange, finally found Cartel.  Ironically I heard a rave about it from Jeff M last year, and I'm glad I didn't have a chance to read his recent review.  I'm your typical social coffee drinker, so maybe I would of felt undeserving to grace the doors based on the flack, but my gal pal and I got no attitude what-so-ever.    In fact the blond barista definitely knew her drinks and graciously explained away.  I didn't have to worry about an order faux pas with my iced mocha, but my friend definitely didn't get any flack when she hoped for a caramel macchiato offering.  Once advised it's not a la Starbucks style, she was gently steered into an agave-flavored ice latte.  Besides both drinks being awesome, I agree w/ Jeff -- it IS about service -- and this barista hit it right on.

Would you be impressed if I told you we've been dining at home with elk burgers served with fries and black truffle aioli?  And then would you smirk when I admit the fries are from McD's drive thru and the aioli is jarred from William Sonoma ($18 soo good)?  Delicious meal and great ambiance... if I get an opp to hang at the Princess again, I'll humbly cut my cloth to fit my means when it's outside of Restaurant Week.  Catch me bellying up to the bar for a burger, trio of duckfat fries w/ the adored truffle dip, and finish w/ the 18 year old butterscotch pot de creme with beignets.  Unfortunately was not wow'd by the truffled mac and cheese, but I own a few bottles of truffle oil myself... I know what we'll be serving at home soon...

NW corner, if you couldn't eyeball it very well from the Google map.  Our lunch group of 12 came, and not one bad review.  The girl sitting next to me could not stop helping herself to my fries, they were seriously that good.  These were no normal McD good quality fries... this was gourmet fries... if they had a drive thru, I'd come here for the fries alone.    Ok but seriously, 12 of us had a large variety of menu offerings and everyone was gobbling it up.  The waitress completely surprised us by being willing to split our checks, how cool is she?!

Really nice counter service for our to-go order, got a hodge podge of their menu.  Both spring and crispy rolls, a rice dish and a wonton pho soup.  The rice dish was charbroiled pork plus shrimp which were pretty small and sort of dried out looking (flash deep fried?).  They gave you romaine lettuce as the veggie accompanied instead of the typical picked veg, which was disappointing.  The different rolls came w/ 3 each which was nice surpise over the typical 2, spring roll was better than the crispy.  Pho was ok.    Total $29, a little pricey though conveniently located to do shopping in LeeLee's afterwards.

I am on the hunt for oysters, any way, any style.  I get odd cravings for iron (I'd say "blood" but that would be instant freak status... oh crap)... so I hunt for oysters or liver (I am the only person my age who eats this as far as I can tell... freak x 2).  Deep fried oyster platter with fries, got 7 oysters and it was ok.  The meh rating is for the all other, rice & beans and the etouffee.  I'd only came back if I'm craving oysters in the area...

My friend's refrigerator died this morning, so we ran around quickly during lunch for some quick appliance shopping.  Here's the findings:  1.  Home Depot -- free delivery but not hookup, but you get the impression it's shipping from a centralized location as the soonest quoted delivery was for another 2-3 weeks (w/out even checking the computer), maybe sooner if someone cancels their delivery date (had nothing to do w/ product avail but rather uber busy due to all the recent holiday sales).  2.  Sears -- $69 delivery + $10 disposal fee of old unit, former is refundable via rebate which will take 8 wks or so (to make sure you don't return the product I'm sure).  3.  Best Buy -- baseline models are higher than HD and Lowes, but they did have floor models w/ scratch and dent avail if you find the one you like.  $30 delivery or free if you buy the $159 geek squad warranty plan.  4.  Lowe's -- free delivery AND hookup (ie ice line), next day avail if appliance in stock.  The inventory actually is sold by store and on premises, hence why they can deliver so quick.  Ding ding, winner if your model is here!

Because there were 3 of us sharing from each cup, I did not feel completely guilty about sampling most of the bottles in those mini plastic cups  (grabbed those wood coffee stir sticks and broke into pieces for tasting).  We sampled about 12 while waiting for our lunch order.  The sister started pouring (!) the plain white balsamic vinegar over her 'wich with each bite -- she ended up getting the White Balsamic Herb Crema and the Blood Orange for salads at home.  The white truffle oil is going to be my new go-to for pan-poaching my egg whites -- my Italian itty bitty bottle remains for drizzling.  Our take home was the 4-pack variety pack of olive oil "muffins".  I seriously had doubts about the cake version of the recipe asking for basically an entire bottle of oil (what cake needs over 2 cups of oil?!).  These suckers were heavy, but now that we're at home, I am so surprised at how great these are... moist (duh) and no grassy olive oil taste.  Since I'm not going to purchase a bottle to pour into an entire cake, these "muffins" will be a definite purchase item every time I go back!

Another find via Local First AZ Independence Week, the place gets an extra star for being a co-op style boutique... this has got to guarantee variety and uniqueness (so I hope, I'm often in Glendale visiting family...bonus the 60/Grand Ave entrance is right around the corner).  The place did make me wish I was a decade younger, as they trend twds punky chic to gothy (cute) skulls.  I'm not so cool to pull off that look, but there are some good finds here.  Some of the clothes definitely reminded me of the items you find in the cheap Hong Kong street markets as well, cute but disposable.

Never used movers before, but my bf was not relishing moving out of his place in near triple digit heat... plus we were trying to beat the end of month rental clock.  So we had friends and family help us w/ the small boxes and furniture the weekend before, leaving the big daddies for the movers (and as it turned out, there was plenty of leftover space in the truck, so then anything after that even down to small potted plants).  It was great.  As all the reviewers stated before, the 3 guys that came were friendly and professional.  Did the job well and fairly quickly.  They definitely met expectations (never having hired anyone before), and I'll be calling them when we're moving out of my home.

Us:  75% of the time we eat out, we eat at our gamut of favorite ethnic Asian restaurants.  My dad is an indy business owner, so I have a special place in my heart for that.  I suspect my boyfriend would say 50% good food / 50% cheap prices.  Read the previous reviews, and you know this isn't some tiny hole-in-the-wall.  So the first 10 min sitting there, my bf frequently mentioned the menu seemed seriously overpriced for Thai food which made me feel guilty for picking out the place... but redemption!  So take this to be true, it really should mean alot when by the end of the meal, he thought the food was THAT good and agreed we'll be back.  How authentic?  I have no idea, we're Swaddee regulars (judge us).  Thumbs up to the Musaman Short Rib and Penang Curry... the sauces were creamy without being cloying coconut sweet, still letting the spices shine thru.. the latter is a winner especially if you like the flavor of kaffir lime leaves.

A group of 18, and as the lunch group staggered in intervals, the 2 waitresses could not be nicer or accommodating (even up to splitting checks, wow).   I took the concensus, most everyone really enjoyed the offerings from the $11.50 4 course set menu... some freaked out over the pandan green sauce over the crispy bananas, obviously rubes not familiar w/ SE Asian flavors... I bet they were expecting Hershey's choc sauce.  :D

Tried 2 years ago and forgot about it.  Recently been visiting family in the West valley, and all the sudden, I've gotten to try many dishes from here.  The Chinese roasted white pork and Singapore noodles are particularly good.  Especially for $1 more than the pho joint across the street, I'm getting alot tastier food and heartier helping.

My new favorite place, tons of designer clothes, many with their original price tags for great prices.  Not college student budget style cheap, but if you earn a pyacheck now and find Nordstrom Rack more your style, go. here. now.  THANK YOU whoever cleans this store slightly smelling of bleach and does not use incense to cover the smell of dingy clothes.  Ok one more time, THANK YOU.

Since the change of ownership, the food is only OK.  So it wasn't ever on my go to list for pho, but after a long day and returning from a biz trip... this is the closest pho joint to my home.  The owner (I assume based on previous experience) sat me down w/ a menu.. and there I sat.. sat ... sat.. and finally the owner goes out w/ a buddy to drink a beer and has to walk by me.. as I continued to sit (first table by the entrance).  At the 10min mark, I gave up and returned the menu to the bar area.  As I walked outside, the owner was like "Are you done already?".  Obviously not, you sat me 10 min ago.. so I found that question pretty condescending.  I told him I didn't receive any service after 10 min, and to his credit, he apologized.  So 2 stars for the ho-hum food, 1 star overall for poor service = erasing knowledge of the existance of this restaurant.  FAIL.  ORIGINAL 10/28/2010 (4 star): I come here occasionally, which means the food is tasty enough.  My personal consensus is the pricing is higher than what I'd generally pay to get a no-soup vermicelli fix (their bowls are huge, yum #20)... This place is good for taking newbies (the atmosphere and decor is modern and inviting) and folks who are judgemental about divey looking joints.

Our 3rd visit, and with an ever rotating menu...if you see the Wagyu Corned Beef.. GET IT!  I have never had a piece of meat so tender and sweet sliced pickles... served atop MJ's pumpernickel bread.. When I heard "MJs", my heart sang a little...  BF had the Chef's Tasting Menu w/ wine pairing, while I only added an addtl main + dessert.  Definitely we left full, and they gave me a copy of the menu so I can hunt down the wines we liked for home.  One thing we've always noted is how attentive service is but in a behind-the-scenes way... you may notice them constantly working around you but not intruding at all.  That take skills.  They changed the flatware so constantly, I started feeling a little guilty for the pampering.

This is a much more manageable version of Forever 21, where you don't feel overwhelmed by the variety and super long lines... but the quality is pretty much on par and a little more expensive.  I like the cute gift and odd/ends items, good for misc bday stuffers.

Yes yes yes, for every reason all the 5 star reviews state below!  Multiple trips to wine country with more than my (small) wine fridge will hold, this is exactly the place I want to crack these bottles open and let the atmosphere and food wash over me.  Hey...though I love to cook at home, I admit my meals do not justify these bottles' price tags. :P  So bring your beautiful wine and enjoy the evening away...  actually bring 2-3 bottles and decide what you are going to pour once you hear the menu  ;)  PS.  Just talking to Chris on the phone, he has more personality than some folks exhibit their entire lives!

Thumbs up to the beef brisket (smoked 14 hrs) topped w/ the spicy sauce!  Friend polished off his pulled pork sandwich.  The beer battered cheese curds reminded me of mini mozza sticks, never had them before.  Green mac & cheese was sludgy (the taste didn't win me over, so I'm weirdly fixated on the texture), but I really enjoyed my first taste of sweet cakelike cornbread.  Definitely we'll be back to work our way thru the menu...

Noticed a full parking lot at their other location at Southern/Dobson, so one day after alot of yard work... decided to head back to this closer location to our home.  Unlike the other location, unfortunately there is a lack of people eating inside... but quote the BF.. "I'd take good food over atmosphere".  The green chile pork tacos special of the day, it wasn't bbq but who cares, it was that good.  I just kept stealing the bbq tastes off my bf's plate (beef brisket still wins!)... this time got the baked potato salad.. nifty presentation, I'm going to steal that idea for a future backyard party.

Initially I was concerned that the half sandwich / soup lunch special wouldn't actually allow me to sample the Cuban flavors... but it does, and you can not beat that $5.99 price!  Plantains and the potaje garbanzo soup was really flavorful (ended up dipping the dry tostones into it).  The pan con bistec sandwich was a tough steak cut but not too bad.. will try the medianoche (on sweet bread) next time.  The jupina pineapple soda, as the waitress said, it really does take like a liquid lifesaver (sugar buzz).... next time I'll save room for one of the homemade desserts and a cortadito to finish.

A 2 hr Homemade Cheese and Dairy Workshop!  Seriously would you not be impressed if your dinner host served you homemade mozzarella in the caprese salad?  My bf signed us up, and I wasn't aware of how much he dropped on the class until I saw the cooking class calendar.  At first I had my doubts b/c other classes I've taken has primarily been watching vs hands-on.  I'm hooked, hands-on is way better than just watching food programs...  The class was worth every dollar...  1.  Hands on made 2 types of cheese, mozzarella and queso blanco or ricotta.  Honestly I don't think you can learn this simply by watching, how do you know when the curds have really formed until you're sticking your face in a steaming pot?  And squeezing the whey... when is too much too much, it's not like you get feedback by just watching...  ;)  2.  While participants are actively working at our group stations, demos are going on... homemade butter is simple, creme fraiche I've always paid too much for.  These are skills I can keep for a lifetime.  3.  Our class was served tasty tidbits throughout the class, ie. freshly made compote butters on artisanal bread... and at the end, it was a huge hors'derves extravaganza... incorprating our newly made mozz, ricottas, butter... etc...  that was filling enough we cancelled our dinner plans but don't bet on that one.

LOVE the fruit topping style cakes, great for special occasions and (non Asian) people find it especially unique.  Not in love w/ their single cake slices w/ the mousse pudding, cake is dry.  GO FRUIT CAKE ALL THE WAY!

Ghetto, cheap shoes and the quality right along with it.  There are stores in the (low end) malls that sell these shoes for much more, I'm sure, so no wonder some people think this is a steal.

Although I've only been once, my sister now goes regularly based on my recommendation.  Take your Japanese hair mags over, cuz he can do it... including the hair perms required for them (bonus haircut is included).    Jim cuts fast, so fast you almost have a perverse desire he'd take a little longer.

Never went to a cosmetology school before but came on a recommendation.  3 Dermalogica facials later, I am hooked.  A sub-$20 facial for an hour+ is great for my budget, my face, and for the future estheticians of America!  After a skin analysis w/ both the instructor and student, they will decide on the best treament for you and go from there... on my 3rd visit, this particular student gave a relaxing foot massage while letting the masque set.  Immediately afterwards I sched my next appt  before her graduation, b/c I enjoyed her facial/mini-massage so much (thanks Trish)!  Each time the instructors/staff made a point to ask if I had any questions or if I was pleased with the service.  It's no luxury spa experience, but it's a school at reasonable prices, so set expectations accordingly.

I unashamedly adore this place.  And it's not b/c I spend gobs of money here... it is b/c I don't have to drive and zig zag all over the Valley to sample (and decide if I like) many of our infamous local food offerings...  Essence's macaroons from Tempe, Tammie Coe cupcakes and MJ's breads (what I always look fwd to) from CenPho, growing selecting of gelatos from all the places you read about... it's a one stop sample shop (ok, you pay for it), and a place I always hit when I'm up in N. Scottsdale.  The $5 cheese boxes are great, a mini variety of 3 cheese in their to-go section is a great way to try new cheeses w/out risk.

On the Whole30 food challenge which is a stricter version of Paleo.  After 2 wks, I needed something quick and not scratch cooked from whole foods.  Googled and found this tasty item, which the cashier really kindly and very friendly entered in:  **Double meat w/ mustard, onion (raw), extra tomato, chilies, protein style (aka wrapped in lettuce).    I'll hold the chilies next time, little hot for me.. but I didn't even know that option existed!

I'm starting with the typical "I feel bad, my first 1 star review"... oh yeah, it was bad.  Tues night, the joint was dead (which made us backstep slightly but what the heck).  I had high hopes for this place since it's been advertised in the Chinese local papers, which is a tough crowd.  The community wants good food, preferably seafood, and for cheap prices.  The food offerings had the dried-out-exposed-to-air-look-long-time-look.  I could of forgiven them if the seafood didn't taste either fishy or completely bland (how does crab legs lose their salty brine flavor?).  They used the cheap high U-count shrimp in their dishes as well, but I did enjoy their oysters with black bean sauce.  Clams, again no flavor.  Variety yes, but what's the point if it doesn't taste all that.

FYI there is no lunch menu so be prepared to order an entree during the day.  Figure $12 w/ tip for lunch, but you'll enjoy the leftovers later!  Yelp'd around and saw iain's positive review, so here I came.  Thai egg rolls are just like the Chinese veg ones except this also had ground chicken, served w/ sweet and sour sauce... nothing special.  But the pad thai was great (less sweet and saucy compared to Swaddee's for ref) and also the fresh bean sprouts were on the side to be mixed in (kudos, we all should say NO to limp overcooked shoots!)  I'll be hauling people here for dinner when in the West Valley, or even if it's myself at lunch.

I am humbled by the saying "If you do something right, noone hears about it.  And if you do something wrong, 10 people will know."  Because this review is 2 years late.  Referrals from trusted people always are the best way to start (as how I found Debbie/AZ Gold), but if you're reading this on Yelp, you probably are wading thru reviews to find your starting point.    So as compared to "marketing" my 2nd property w/ a West Valley based company, I realize what a stark distinction in customer service and attn I was fortunate to receive in working w/ Debbie Mann/AZ Gold Realty in marketing my 1st property 2 years ago.  Responsive, helpful w/ candid advice re: rentals, LLCs, market conditions, get-over-yourself-that-your-property-is-a-gift-from-Heaven, and went above and beyond (I now realize) in meeting prospective tenants.  I wish Debbie did support the West Valley, as now I have a comparison to another company how sub-par or (maybe) standard service I am getting ("we'll call you") for my 2nd property.    I work for a company of 5k+ Type A people who thoroughly vet / praise / condemn the folks they contract with.  And often many of them come across my Yelp reviews and asks me for referrals privately.  Well here I am publicly referring this outfit anytime you need services for marketing a rental or for full fledged property mgt... Debbie Mann would be the 1st person I would turn to (in the East Valley). :)

It truly is a BOUTIQUE, decorated very nicely.  Clothing, shoes and accessories are upscale and sophisticated.  This is not bargain college shopping (are you outgrowing Buffalo Exchange too?)... these are designer clothes and dresses you can wear to formal parties and for work, I will constantly be checking this place out to see how inventory turns.  To give you an idea, both dresses I drooled over were ~$100 but Betsey Johnson and BCBG also normally retails a few hundred.

A team lunch, and 3 of us has gotten food poisoning.  I was the first, called yesterday and spoke to manager Christian who sounds like a high school kid who only kept saying "we'll look into this" and "go see a doctor".  Finally I said I'm calling you in good conscious that there's an issue with your food, and finally I told him I will know when I need to go see a doctor.  Talking to this guy was like being in a car accident, where he kept side stepping to admit any responsibility or even basic acknowledgement that the restaurant could make you ill within minutes of leaving.  The next day, I learned 2 more coworkers are ill, one who is ill with fever and throwing up.  I just called again to update Christain, and literally I quote him "awesome, excellent.  We'll look into this".   FOR THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM OR COURTESY, I will not be eating here again and will redirect my peers to do the same.

I've been half ogling Le Creuset for a few years (Cook's Illustrated rated as best dutch oven for braising) but the prices are outrageous...  But I was on my way up to Flag, so why not randomly peruse the outlet.  Apparently the factory store runs a theme sale each month, and the color I wanted was on sale (cherry red, last month was blue and yellow).  The sales guy was so kind, he checked all the inventory so I could piece out the best lid and oven combo and feel confident in my "factory seconds" purchase.  Basically just some minor scratches, though there was one that was missing a huge piece of enamel...    This might be leading down a path of expensive cookware... but at least I'll call ahead to see what color is on sale if I'm making the drive...

$12.95 lunch buffet (no fresh seafood offered during lunch).  I've been curious about casino buffets, and with a friend visiting w/ Malaysia, I used this as an excuse to try going on the Loop 101N on our mini AZ roadtrip.    Yes: Prime rib (no casino buffet should be without it plus you get an offering of creamy horseradish or the plainer, intense one) Cheese selections (snob appeal to have a cheese course after my main and prior to dessert) Berries & creme anglaise on puff pastry (this was soooo good, I sat here an extra 15 min relishing this with coffee) 14 flavors of gelato/sorbet (go ahead, that really nice counter lady will kindly scoop several mini tastes into a platter for you...hehe)  AND YES REALLY: Shrimp wonton soup!  I was digging it... but kept quiet cuz really, really?a buffet can make wontons this good?.  Then my Malaysian friend said "this is really good" and I got way too excited for being inside a casino and tripped over to get a second bowl.  Though I'm not sure how this place ranks with other casino buffets, this meal has to be an incredible deal when I kept tabs on how much we'd spend on lunch for the remainder of our trip.

So I am going thru first-time-remodeling-a-home-anxiety (hellloo... the 80s called and wants all their light fixtures back!)...  Call me naive.. but where do you go to find light fixtures after Lowe's, Home Depot and Lamps Plus?!  By chance I drove by this store after a Lowe's light fixture purchase that I wasn't completely in love with...  THIS is my holy grail lighting store (does it count if I've only been to 4 places?!  But I don't want to order online... I'm a touchy feely home decorator apparently...)  Many styles without being dated & cheesey and prices of all ranges (whereas Lamps Plus just made my eyes bug).  The sales assoc was so kind and friendly, willing to climb up and down ladders to look at price tags and gave me info sheets on the models I was interested in.    As each outdated fixture goes, I'll be enthusiastically stopping by here...

From the Taiwanese owners of Eba Cafe that was uber popular for their drinks, they are back.  4 stars for the drinks alone, the variety is huge!  I never ate in their previous location, so I'm working thru the menu...avoiding the generic American-Chinese offerings, we've tried the Jap ramen (eh), beef noodle soup (overall combo of flavors are good but the broth itself is very oily), broiled squid (good)...  The owner and tiny tiny waitress are very friendly!  Definitely we'll be back for drinks over and over again.

I'm bouncing around the menu... it's still all about the drinks, but I do like the beef wrap green onion pancake.  Sounds like they are going to start serving Chinese breakfast items on the weekends only (11-2), can't wait to see what it's all about.  I'm hoping for hot soy bean milk w/ butterfly sticks...

Finally a great alternative to the plethora of gelato shops... friendly cashiers will pass out or upon asking, provide itty bitty sample cups so you can self-serve samples.  You'll have to be pretty good about your hand eye coordination to get the samples into those cups, so I started putting in a tiny squeeze to fill the cup and top off w/ a second flavor, so I didn't have to ask for ... oh 12 cups or whatever to try all the flavors (no I didn't, but I eventually will).  :)  Since it's self serve and charge by the ounce (37cents/oz at this time), you get this HUGE generous cup... obviously a good psych ploy to fill 'er up.  Go ahead... it's gooooood... red velvet cake batter and pistachio topped with Heath bars...  taro flavor is coming soon and can't wait to try the mochi topping.    With my 3 variants (like 3 mini cones) + 1 scoop topping was under $3, I'm picking this over gelato in Chandler anytime.

Review is for customer service, not for actual car wash (cuz that's pretty std and can you really mess that up).  If you like wheeling and dealing like in a 3rd world country street market for your car wash services, then this is the place for you.  I disliked the "what do you want, what would you like, we'll cut you a deal" statements and their back and forth,etc.  The site mgr Chris definitely had that shark like attitude, he should work for a 1980s car dealership.  Extremely bad taste in my mouth.

A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed.  Pricey too.  My chopped liver (I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.  i was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's.

Remember the Seinfeld episode where Jerry takes his car to the mechanic who is fanatical about the car, thinks Jerry ain't doing a good job, and kidnaps the car from Jerry?  Welcome Sean of wood and laminate flooring installs...  THIS is a guy you want installing your floor.  Some contractors are really owners who do the bids, and the day the real work is starting, you get some young hires at the door (not that they aren't qualified).  Sean is an owner operated biz, and he talks about floors like they are living and breathing organisms... "acclimating"... "resting"...  He lets you order the floors thru his wholesaler (went w/ Consumer Reports top rated Armstrong laminate), and since I paid the company direct, I bought at cost which was definitely cheaper than the retail (I shopped retail first, narrowed my choices, so I knew what I wanted by the time I went to the wholesaler's showroom).  He also accommodated my budget conscientiousness (to put it nicely), allowing me to buy my own baseboards and paint before he installed.  But let's talk about dedication... Sean really wants the floors to be installed right.  When we noticed a flex in the floor b/c of different levels of concrete where the 2 seams meet, I left him in the house in the morning for a quick tear down job and lay in some filler to remove the flex.  Come lunch time swing by the house to drop off my first Costco groceries for the new place, Sean is still there... he took it upon himself to GRIND DOWN the concrete, causing him several hours of addtl work.  He just wanted to floors to not flex and using filler wasn't working.  Later he calls me and chides me about the temp of the house, and how it's drying out my floors... fanatical devtion I tell you... and I mean it in a very complimentary way.    You want a contractor who loves what they do and does what they do well.  I have full confidence Sean stands by his work, he's been over several times working around other contractors and we've had several discussions re: any concerns (or maybe his concerns...haha).  He was recommended to me by a flooring company whose installers were couple x what he charges, so the nice mgr whispered she'll email me a contact on the side who she has referred alot of biz to... I'm glad she did.

I'm told moving is one of the top 5 stressful things you can do in life, well I'd add home renovation as well.  I'm also told never argue in front of the help...  well technically we didn't, but we certainly had a disagreement right before Robert came to measure the windows.  It was probably our only major full blown "tense" discussion.. hahaha.  When we purchased the home, half the windows were already replaced and upgraded.  The prev homeowner gave us his window contact, stated he was so pleased with this guy and w/ several quotes, he blew the competition away.  We were looking for matching windows for the rest of the home and to take advantage of Federal engery tax credits, so we trusted the referral.  Enter Robert into a highly charged atmosphere.  We gave him our differing opinions, and he said in his gentle and kind way "I'm a visionary, I can see where you are going with this."  He goes on to give us some ideas and inputs, and very very tactfully, goes off into the bedroom to measure the windows there.  Amazingly enough, we needed that.  His inputs helped form a fairly different look and idea that we were both happy with for construction of the wall we were moving and window placement.  By the time he walked out of the bedroom, we were all smiles and eager to discuss the new window addition.  Robert and his helper replaced all the remaining windows in the home and cleaned up the dust afterwards.  Until I posted this review, never went to his webpage but glad to see the awards received for his great customer service.  I'll back that up as well.    And our only major drama is over.  We're going to survive it.  :D

One of those restaurants where you go in, and go "huh, why is it sooo empty".  Albeit it's a Wed nght, but it's also Restaurant Week... I even felt like we owned the entry area of the Theodore.. never saw a soul except a desk guy hidden in an alcove.  Park in the adjacent Buckboard lot, as there was a sign stating Guest Parking $10 though I didn't see an attendant who could collect.  4 people, all a variety of dishes from the very promising sounding menu so we definitely had the works.  It just did not wow.  I appreciated the papardelle pasta was freshly made (but kept tossing overboard to my bf the mushy bland short rib meat... mid week leftovers?) and the meyer lemon tart.  General repeated comment re: our mains... salty.  Now I can see this being a place for lounging and drinks, especially if they were to draw those curtains down around you to cozy up your table.  But I want to like the food too.

They had my heart when I learned they served wine by the half carafes (pichet).  Whenever in Seattle, I dine at Le Pichet and always sigh afterwards in Phx wishing for a place who would do exactly this.  It's upscale comfort food, I get it.. totally.  Scanning the menu reminded me of a coglameration of the Food Network shows post 9/11 to today (when comfort food took a huge resurrgence and cooking magazine subscriptions peaked after the economy tanked)... the menu is inspiring, all within gourmet reach of making at home but you come here to eat it, because they (most likely) will make it better, present it better, or you just haven't gotten around to attempting it yourself.  And so that was how I ordered, to see how does the kitchen execute the dishes for notes on how I might duplicate the deliciousness at home.  Sitting at the table next to us were young children, and it was really great to see how the staff went out of their way to be extra nice and serve little treats to them at the end of the meal.  Comfort food AND a nice homey feeling.

We buzzed down two trees to make room for fruit bearing ones, but we still had the stumps to contend with.  For my boyfriend's time, effort and sweat, it was completely worthwhile to go w/ Zach.  He came recommended... Done in 1 hr and reasonably priced.  Oh yes he's insured, so don't worry if HE loses his finger!

Whenever the fellow jurors plan to grab coffee (Starbucks is at the bottom level of the court house), I get all sweet and doe eyed and uppity state "oh no, let's support a local biz instead!" and we've bounced around a few coffee places since.  I get girly caramel or mocha nonfat lattes, and they are good.  I THINK the pricing is better than Starbucks (after all, how would I know? :D), plus the Yelp checkin deal is really nice if this trial goes WAY TOO LONG (Day 6 so far).  I would of thought this place was a corporate empire, if it was not for the Yelp reviews.  Each time I have noticed the greeting and smiling owner, doing his thing.  Just across the street north of CityScape, if a juror is trying to calculate how much time do they have...

I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...   At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.  The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!  SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC.

We went from BLINDING morning sun on our east facing walls that even energy efficient windows could not completely eliminate the incoming heat to coolness and no more ducking or moving around the sunlight when eating breakfast.  At my workplace, coworkers are diligent and do their homework.. oh ok, and extremely anal... so this one came as a recommendation from one who did several quotes and had his shades up for at least half a year and is still happy with them with the best pricing.  6 colors to choose from..different %s as well.. we did 90% on our ceiling windows and 80% (85%?) on our ground windows.. looks great!  The tan metal trims matched the look of our existing house as well.  Turnaround was quick, customer service was great (he noted the wrong color was installed on some panels before installation, so he came back the next day w/ the correct versions).

2 quotes total, the other was a biz already rated on Yelp.  I was turned off by the other b/c 1) overquoted my sq footage by 150 ft (he did a haphazard very quick laser beam test) 2) suddenly lost eye contact w/ me in determining the price and 3) everytime he talked to me (he followed up w/ me almost daily.. I'll give him credit for that), it seemed like he'd drop the price another $150-200.  By the end, after I thanked him for his time and told him I'm going somewhere else... he called me up an hour later and offered to undercut this company by $100.  By now, we were at 50% of his original quote... SHADY.  It's ok to make a profit and have some play, but constantly driving down your own price in high pressure tactics to get into the door just made me feel ripped off.  My dad is an indy contractor himself, so even w/ the undercut, I thanked him again, reconfirmed I've committed to someone else and couldn't do that to the other company.  Why I went here...  Owner Shannon quoted over the phone, price by sq footage (not a size-you-up-estimate).  When she came to actually measure, all the pricing was std and straightfwd and her good ol' tape measure was 150 sq ft less than the other guy (I did not even tell her about my experience w/ the other guy until the job was done)... I was impressed from beginning to end.  She worked around the other 5-6 contractor schedules I was juggling, with her and family coming in an doing the work directly.  As far as I can tell (since the other guy literally grilled me when I told him I'm passing), she was providing the same exact service and product for cleaning and re-sealing the grout.  What a difference when you choose to re-seal!  Years of grime has vanished under the protective coat (cleaning itself does not save the grout).  Shannon kindly left me some addtl silicone grout and leftover seal, as she knew I'll be needing touchups and addtl repair before all the contractors were done.   Great customer service!

First child, marginally high risk factor (36 yrs old), and my goal was an Ina May Gaskin natural midwifery style birth... so going to a doctor led midwife practice was the best of both worlds for this level of support... urgent medical attention or intervention as needed with the respect and care of midwifery birthing practices.  During your prenatal visits, you have an opp to rotate your visits with Dr. Kells and the 2 current midwives, Lupe & Amy.  End of day, I would of been confident with any of them who would be able to attend my birth.  After 50+ hrs of early home labor and active labor at the hospital with my doula and assisted by Lupe (midwife), complications arose for both myself and child, and Dr. Kells was called in for an emergency C-section.  He did a neat and awesome job, and as some folks have told me, he's 'genius' when it comes to C-section stitches.  Other pros: 1.  Midwife / doula led classes - meet other expecting couples in the same birth month, learn what you may not have read on your own, and they give you food for thought for items you did not think about it.  Probably will develop a great network of friends as well with a shared common bond.  :)  2.  Met my doula - not my original intent, but as I got to know the doula and saw how well she was integrated with the office... it it s great to have a person dedicated soley be focused on you and your advocate thru the entire birthing process.  3.  Dr. Kells is frank and a straight shooter, you could ask a question and he might ask you in return, what would you do with the information, so you understand what it is and why are you asking.  Tests, u/s, etc were kept to a minimum or as needed... it's probably what the rest of the world in low risk pregnancies do... vs my other friends always seem to be doing x, y, z and causing themselves some unnecessary stress, concern or expectations.

Pregnancy craving!  Pre pregnancy, we were eating pretty much eating unprocessed foods at home including breads.  Now I am in at least every other week to pickup Eureka's organic breads.  Tip:  If there is the monthly flier, they have a 20% off coupon for 1 item.. great to use on the Bob Mill's selection.. ie. almond flour for $8/bag is better than Whole Foods $11.99/bag.

Pregnancy cravings!  Relatives of my fave pho place Phu Thanh (now located at the LeeLee's on the West side).  The menu is a bit different as their style, but I'm enjoyable working thru the menu...  my go to Vietnamese place when the need for more light and healthful hits!
