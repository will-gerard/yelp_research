What a great place!! We went in on a Monday night for the Bears game and the first thing I noticed on the happy hour menu was two Chicago style hot dogs and beer pairing. Perfect! Being a Chicago native myself, I'm very particular about my dogs! Let me tell you, they didn't disappoint! We also found out from a super friendly staff member that the head chef is from Chicago and also features Italian beef sandwiches for happy hour on Mondays. They were so nice that having found out it was our first time in, they comped our desert and gave us a ten dollar off coupon for our next visit.   Aside from the fantastic service, their menu was extensive from pizzas to salads, even a jambalaya pot pie.. We'll definitely make San Tan out regular Monday night stop!

Rude service and uninformed manager.. I went in on Saturday and as always, this tiny place was packed.. Line out the door. Not feeling the best, my fiancée and my best friend and I went to the bar to order bloody Mary's while we waited. Apon giving the bar tender (long blonde hair, in 30's) my ID, she studied it skeptically and not thinking it was me(I have brown hair in my pic and I'm now blonde) and after a few awkward moments she asked if I had another ID. I told her no, that when I travel, I only bring one ID so I don't loose any of others I have. I'm 29 years old.. My best friend is 32, and my fiancée is over 40! We don't look young! She didn't ask me to verify any personal info on the ID as they're required to do, but instead stated the obvious that there's no expiration date. News flash: there's no expiration date on AZ state ID's bc they never expire! We tried to inform her of this, and come to find out, she was also a manager that didn't know this information! Her customer service skills were horrible and she didn't even apologize but instead made the drinks and had this attitude like she was doing me this huge favor. No thank you even when I still tipped her 20%. I understand she was trying to do her job but she could have done without all of the snobbiness.  I'm never coming back here again. The food was mediocre and my bagel was stale. The wait just isn't worth it. I recommend Morning Squeeze right up the street on Scottsdale rd.  They're always friendly and the food is ten times better with a lot more healthier options.

What's great about this place is that it's a sports bar/restaurant and literally has tv's everywhere! If you're a sports fanatic and have early morning games to watch, this is the place for you. Family friendly and offers a full bar as well.  Their Benedict's are out of this world and the service is always spot on. This is definitely worth checking out!  Great little gem in Chandler!!

This is hands down one of my favorite places! If you love homemade pasta and good quality authentic Italian  food than Evo is for you. Servers are awesome not to mention the owner Nick coming up and introducing himself to everyone., super friendly and inviting staff. Atmosphere is trendy and intimate. Grapefruit basil martinis are a must too! Def worth checking out!

Hands down the best bloody in town! Saw Evo's Insta post advertising a unique octopus Bloody Mary and knew I had to stop in. They use a smoked salmon vodka, Reservation mix which is soooo yummy, even sports a mussel! Brunch menu is on point.. Food is always excellent here regardless the time you stop in. Hanging with Dom and Jake two of the nicest bar tenders, great convo and super friendly service! Always nice chatting it up with the owner Nick too! It's like family here! Love Evo!

Super friendly service! I went in on a busy Sunday with my boyfriend for pedicures and they got us in very quickly, sitting together. The massage chairs were fantastic and the staff was very helpful explaining the settings. We got the $45.00 all inclusive package and with the leg mask, hot foot wax, sugar scrub and massage, I was in heaven! My boyfriend was very comfortable being the only man  work done! Definitely going back next week for a gel fill!

This place is somewhat hidden behind Nandos, located in the same building so be sure to drive around to see it! The remodel on this place is awesome, very trendy and sophisticated. Because I'm obsessed with spicy seafood marinara pasta, I ordered the spicy mussels and added angel hair pasta. The mussels were buttery, melt in your mouth good! They tasted very fresh. I was hoping for a more 'brothy' spicy sauce over the thick marinara but the mussels were so good it didn't matter. My husband ordered the Greek pita and he inhaled the sandwich he loved it that much. We shared some Greek fries that have lemon and feta on them that were amazing too. For dessert we had tirimisu which did not disappoint! We are coming back! If u love Greek them eat here!
