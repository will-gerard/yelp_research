Dolce has been my go-to place for spa services since I relocated to Scottsdale. However, this soon may change.   The first time I visited the Borgata location I was taken aback by the stylish decor of the two story spot equipped with a hair salon, nail salon, makeup boutique, and a variety of unique purses, jewelry, clothes, gifts, etc. The front desk staff was incredibly kind and helpful, immediately checking me in and showing me to the locker room to change, and then to the Relaxation Room to wait for my services to begin. They even bought me lunch from Blanco once they realized I was going to be there for a full day. After a 1 hour Organic Facial, 2 hour Swedish Massage with Aromatherapy and Hot Stones, Spa Pedicure and Manicure, Shampoo/Conditioned Hairstyle, and full Makeup application I left feeling like a total Bitchin' Rockstar, ready to ravage the clubs in OldTown to celebrate my birthday.  Since then, I have been in multiple times for different services: massages, mani/pedis, spray tanning. Each of those occasions I noticed that the quality of services stayed exceptional, while the customer service was not as great. Today, I had the worst experience with Dolce at the Borgata and I am considering not going back.  After waiting for 30 minutes on hold, I finally scheduled my 90 min. Organic Facial and a 2 hour Swedish Massage. I was told to arrive early at 10:15 to check in and relax in the Relaxation Room, and my facial would start at 10:30. When asked if I wanted a complementary shampoo blowout and makeup touch up, I happily accepted and eagerly anticipated my long overdue day of pampering. When I arrived at 10:15, I was not greeted with a smile, a hello, a head nod, or a "i'll be with you in a moment". Instead the Client Coordinators were chatting among themselves with their backs turned toward the door, and as a client I was the one who had to get their attention. After one of the girls checked me in, she told me to take a seat and someone would be with me shortly, then continued to chat with her coworkers. After wandering around the store looking at hair products, makeup, skin care, and accessories I checked my phone and it was 10:35! Irritated, I interrupted the Client Coordinators' discussion notifying them that my appointment was supposed to start at 10:30, and asked if I could at least go back into the locker room to change.   Finally, my esthetician Jordyn found me and brought me to back for my facial. Amazingly, she was courteous and friendly!!! A welcomed change from the other staff. Her analysis of my skin and choice of products was right on point, and along with a High Frequency breakout treatment and Eye treatment, I left the room with my face feeling like it was kissed by angels!   Next, my 2 hour Swedish Massage with Josh. Best masseuse I have found so far!!!! After reviewing my target areas, he started with a Fiji Coconut Oil Scalp Massage, and continued with my requested blend of Peppermint/Eucalyptus Aromatherapy, Spot Deep Tissue treatment, and Hot Stones. Needless to say I left the session floating on Cloud 12, leaving all the stress and tension from my neck and shoulders, as well as pain in my lower back, in the room behind me.   On to my complementary shampoo styling with Elise, who did a fantastic job maintaining friendly and interesting conversation, and following through with my request for a voluminous blowout. Too bad I can't say the same about my complementary makeup touch-up with  Jewel. As a touch-up, I didn't expect much, but the mineral powder applied was at least 2 or 3 shades darker than my skin tone. Topped off with a dark bronzer and a maroon lipstick/gloss that reminded me of something my grandmother (god rest her soul) would have worn!!! Needless to say, when I returned to the locker room to change, I immediately had to do my own touch-up to the touch-up just so I wouldn't be humiliated while checking out and walking to my car.  When checking out, I presented Client Coordinator Rachel with a Groupon worth $80 of services, along with the Fall Menu with Special prices listed, a hair styling product I wanted to purchase, and my Dolce Discount Bag. It took Rachel at least 15 minutes to calculate how much I needed to pay after looking at the regular menu and Fall menu multiple times. After returning back home, I looked at my receipt and realized that Rachel had only given me a $40 discount for my Groupon. I paid $40 dummy...it wouldn't be a Groupon if I only received $40 worth of services!!! I had to then return to the Spa to ask her for an explanation and for a refund for being overcharged.  It's sad that the Dolce brand is being jeopardized by Client Coordinator staff members who have no concept of customer service, or basic math skills for that matter, even though the facial, hair, massage, and nail professionals always meet or exceed my expectations. I sincerely hope management takes action ASAP!!!!

I can't say enough about one hairstylist in particular. Julia is the ONLY one in Scottsdale who I trust to touch my lovely long locks. She listens to what I want, but also contributes suggestions. She is a color genius, creating stunning dimension that can be subtle for a less noticeable grow-out over time, or dramatic and bold. She is meticulous, and proud of her work. She also makes the time fly by making conversation and overall treating you like you're talking to a friend you've known for years. Overall time in the chair is a little long, but I'm willing to spend a few extra hours to walk out feeling like doing a Beyonce hair flip
