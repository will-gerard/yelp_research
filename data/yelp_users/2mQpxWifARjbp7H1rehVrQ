I took a chance and booked a room at 4 star resort on hotwire.com for $55 a night.  After booking, when this particular resort was revealed, I knew it was worth the gamble. $55 is a great deal, even with the $16 resort fee.  I loved the nice big rooms, lush greenery, and interesting spaces for socializing, especially the pool area and huge fire pit outside of the bar. I didn't really make the most of the other resort amenities since I spent most of my time by the pool, but my primary goal was to soak up some sun and catch up with old friends here, so it was money and time very well spent. I'd stay at this resort again in a heartbeat.

We booked this hotel on Hotwire.com a few hours before we arrived at the hotel.  We got a pretty good deal.  I didn't think it would be anything special, but as it turns out, I loved it.  It was easy to find and not too far off the path from Minneapolis to Chicago. The room seemed to be designed with my habits in mind.  First of all, it was nice and spacious.  There was one queen bed (my preferred size) that was firm - in a good way.  It had two well-lit vanity areas; one inside the bathroom and one outside of the bathroom.  This is perfect, because I tend to spread out a lot when getting dolled up.  The closet area is with the vanity area, just as it should be.  The room has a mini kitchen area with a microwave and a small fridge.  I love this because I always travel with fresh food or end up with leftovers from some great nearby restaurant that I can't bear to throw away.   There was also a coffee maker.  Hallelujah.  I just want to stumble from the bed to the coffee maker and make it myself within moments of waking to avoid having to interact with the outside world in a pre-caffeinated groggy state (I'm pointing fingers at you, expensive boutique hotels!!) The room did not have a fancy TV, but who cares....the best perk of all was the free wi-fi, which is all I need for entertainment in my room. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

This restaurant is pretty...but not dazzling as some other reviewers have indicated.  When we came here on a Saturday night, I was surprised to see that other patrons had clearly put on their best sparkley outfits just to dine here.  This is in a strip mall, people.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the many upscale Asian restaurants in Minneapolis where you can eat, drink, dance, mingle and lounge in your best outfit all night long.  On to the food... First of all, why doesn't Takeda Thai have fresh spring rolls?  This was my first disappointment.  I settled for the lettuce wraps for my appetizer instead - which they happily veganized for me - making it with with tofu rather than chicken.  The flavors and textures were really blah though.  I wouldn't recommend that appetizer to anyone. I shared my main entree with my boyfriend, not realizing how teeny-tiny the serving would be.  We had the Thai Basil with tofu.  The flavors were amazing.  Although,sadly, the entire dish was made up of about 6 pieces of tofu and 6 thin slices of red pepper.  I would've been a lot more impressed with this dish if there were more vegetables involved.  When the dish was set in front of us, I actually felt misled by the menu's description.   I also think the up-charge for brown rice here is a little ridiculous...but at least they offer it. Our server was spectacular.  He knew we were in from out of town and did his best to impress us.  At the end of our meal, he asked us how we enjoyed ourselves, and I didn't have the heart to tell him that Yelp's phrase was ringing in my head..."meh, I've experienced better".

We were hungry and everything else was closed near our gate (except Wendy's, which doesn't count as food in my book), so we ate some chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  My expectations were low, so I wasn't surprised to be unimpressed. The chips came in three colors - Yellow #5, Blue #1, and natural corn color.  The salsa was completely pureed - no chunks at all.  It was more like hot sauce.  Ugh.  The guacamole was pretty flavorless.  This is not my kind of food. The service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport, however.
