Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.  Canyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.  My first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect!   My fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.  In the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.  This particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old.   I'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,  "Oh, you're not finished?"     No. "Just enjoying the weather?"     ..........  I think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school. This place reeks of complacency. 2 stars only because of the margaritas.

I have been truant with my Dukedom for far too long. A review is due lest I be usurped.  Majerle's (Mar-lees) is one of downtown Phoenix's great sports bar. It's great for pre-gaming before heading down the street to US Airways Center or Chase Field. It's great for post-game festivities after leaving the stadiums. And it's great for just watching any game with friends on any of the multiple HD TVs.  Majerle's has plenty of beers on tap, a solid HH menu, and serves libations until around 2am every night. It also seems like it's a bonafide occupational qualification to be hot to work here, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.   Majerle's is not great with food, however. They shell out the typical pedestrian bar fare, which is highly suitable for the typical Diamondbacks fan, but if your taste buds yearn for something more refined, you're much better off grabbing food at Networks Bar and Grill or The Arrogant Butcher down the street.   In conclusion, Majerle's is the slam dunk watering hole in downtown on a game night. Check it out!

Look good, feel good. Right? Right. V's Barbershop did not disappoint in the least bit. According to my mental tally of top five haircuts, this one ranks second in my long career of barbershoppering. Well done, you've received a new loyal customer.  Kuddos to Josh for his fine attention to detail with the fades!  A tip to everyone out there. Please wash your hair before going to the barber out of respect for the staff. No one wants to finger through greasy, vermin ridden hair.

This Target is a bullseye!  I have always had a positive experience across the 50+ times I have been here!  Parking is easy, perusing the aisles with complimentary Wi-Fi is a nice touch, and the checkout aisles are ran very efficiently. David appears to be one of the shift supervisors, and always displays a high level of professionalism and expertise. Well done!

This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.  It is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal, but I have to say I have missed Target.    When I walk through the front doors I just feel miserable. The 'energy-saving' automatic lights make me seize. The narrow aisles make me claustrophobic. The overall dinginess consumes me. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with an anxious feeling similar to when I brought a bad report card back to my parents. Or when I had to confront an ex-gf's parents about why the Pennsylvania State Troopers were calling them at 4am.   My pace quickens. My pupils dilate. The lump in my throat expands. I try to gasp for air, but the weight on my chest suffocates me. I feel lethal; on the verge of frenzy. My mask of sanity is about to slip. Sweat beads down my back. My aggressiveness becomes visible. The curmudgeon at the self-checkout grunts at me. Darkness comes over me...  I reemerge 36 hours later with no semblance of reality. Fry's is a catalyst of my psychosis.

*Cash Only*  $5 for link removal! I was in and out of this place in literally 2 minutes! Trust me, I timed it on my new chronograph watch I was getting sized.  I Yelped watch repair places in my local area, and found some options closer to me. However, this place has 4.5 stars, and it held true to its rating.   I will be bringing all of my future online watch purchases to this place to be sized.

If I could buy this entire store I would. My eyes say yes, but my wallet says no. For now.  The sales associate was so helpful in helping me pick out a Global knife for the girl's bday. Even though the store was busy with post-Christmas shoppers, I was well taken care of. I told her what specs I was looking for, what price range, and for what occasion, and we agreed on the perfect knife. I went to check out the cookbooks while the associate grabbed the packaged knife from the storeroom. She told me she'd have it at the counter for me when I finished my shopping.  In the meantime, I grabbed a thick French cookbook with plenty of pictures (the best part), and proceeded to check out. The associate helped me right away, and away I went, another happy camper.   FYI: you can buy these knives or any utensils cheaper at a restaurant wholesaler or online, but hey, Williams-Sonoma is a bitchin' ass store.

I drive well out of my way to go to this Midas. I think that says it all.   I was so upset with the lousy service from the associates at the Big-O Tires on McDowell and Scottsdale that I needed to take my business to someone who treats their customers with respect and appreciation.   The associates at Midas are very courteous, expedient, and very thorough when reviewing all your car's information with you. I apologize for not knowing the gentleman's name at the front counter, but he is a true service professional.   They have earned my loyalty, and I hope more people come to this Midas to experience how auto mechanic shops should be run.

No need to read any other review. This place is a gas station. You don't come here for an experience. You stop here to get gas and take a leak while driving in/out of Las Vegas. Multiple pumps and easy accessibility back onto 93 N and S. Boom.

It's 11pm, my friend and I have been shooting craps for about 3 hours, and we're both up a sizeable amount of money. We cash out, I Yelp to find steakhouses, and I find Gallagher's at NYNY is still open. I'm sold. I want to dine like a winner.  The calamari, filets, and glasses upon glasses of champagne were nothing short of heaven. I have no complaints about Gallagher's. It's really hard for me to complain as my friend and I were indulging ourselves courtesy of casino winnings, but that's not to discredit the food or service here, which were both excellent. I HIGHLY recommend the filet. It's aged and seasoned perfectly.  Gallagher's. Where the winners eat.

There really couldn't have been a better 'moment of truth' than when the elevator opened up to an immaculate kitchen with the brigade prepping, firing, and plating all the decedent entrees. This set the tone for the dining experience.  Unfortunately I wasn't here to have dinner. I had just met up with my former casino professor turned good friend, and we were thirsty.   We sat at the bar in a way where we could overlook the LV Boulevard and the Bellagio fountains. As many of the other reviews state, the view is exceptional. A perfect date spot with that special someone. However, we were here to get lit. He started with some gin martini, I went for the manhattan on the rocks. At $20 a pop it doesn't come cheap, but if you were to imagine the perfect manhattan, this would surely be it. After a couple drinks each we were feeling all warm and fuzzy.  We ordered the French cheese board and crab salad to hold us over. The cheeses were phenomenal! I don't recall exactly what cheeses they were, but they covered a broad spectrum of cheeses. From bold and pungent, to creamy and luscious. The bartender also supplied us with plenty of extra crostinis to accompany our cheeses. We also had the crab salad. The crab was so sweet and wrapped in thinly sliced cucumbers, and surrounded by a small bed of greens. Definitely not filling at all, but a nice treat.  Overall a good experience. Pricey, but worth it. Bon appetit!

C'est un joli restaurant!  I made a last minute reservation for brunch using OpenTable, and luckily got the time I wanted. Patio seating cannot be reserved, but I wasn't bummed. I lose my appetite if I watch the LV street carnies too long.   I ordered the Benedict and asked if I could substitute the ham with salmon.   "Certainly, Monsieur," said our server, #51.   I say #51 because they have numbers in place of their names. I asked why this was. I was told each number corresponds to a different Arrondissement of Paris. I thought there were only 20, and I saw numbers upwards of 70, so who knows if that's the real reason. Servers should have names on their name tags, not numbers. It strikes me the wrong way. Anyways, I'll get off my soapbox. His name was Rey, and he was boss.  We started with a carafe of Frangria. Their French spin on sangria, which got me sufficiently buzzed. Delicious. Smooth. Indulgent. In fact, I'm having olfactory memories of the rosemary sprigs in the Frangria. Nostalgia.  The salmon Benny was literally perfect. The hollandaise was light, the salmon fresh and a proper pink, and the yolk a well executed poached egg; oozing after a slight application of pressure. The accompanying hash browns were well seasoned and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   We had a wonderful table along the glass partition next to the server's wine station. It felt exclusive, intimate, and very conducive to private conversation.   I want to go to Paris...

After a long and stressful work week, I wanted to enjoy a delectable Sunday brunch with The Lady. Being fairly new to Phoenix, I had to search Yelp for brunch spots in the valley, and read rave reviews about Chelsea's Kitchen. I called to make a reservation on the patio, but unfortunately CK doesn't take them. Hmm, ok.   Having worked as a valet for many years, I understand the importance of the first impression. Kudos to the valets for their engagement and sense of humor.     Much to my chagrin, a patio table was a 20 minute wait. If only CK accepted reservations...We opted to be seated right away. We weren't disappointed with our table in the least bit. It was a perfect spot to look across the entire restaurant with our backs to the morning sun shining through the windows behind us.   The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. The Lady described it as being very 'homey, intimate and quaint." The background noise was very minimal, due in large part to the openness of the restaurant and the nice table spacing, even despite the open kitchen being smack-dab at the main doors. To be honest, I did have a beautiful woman sitting next to me, so it was hard for me to focus on anything else.   Our server was great. Very friendly, always smiling, and expedient. She was there when we needed her, and gone when we did not. The French press pot she left on the table added a nice upscale feel to the coffee, and the mimosas were a perfect blend.  The Lady ordered the Eggs Benedict, which I was going to order, so I had to make an audible at the line of scrimmage. Chilaquiles it is. The atmosphere set the bar high for the food, but sadly the food left a little to be desired. Maybe add a little more seasoning to the chicken in the Chilaquiles. The Lady's poached eggs were actually medium boiled eggs. That poor LGO English muffin didn't get any yolk! Simmer water and crack an egg into it and you're 90% on your way to poaching an egg.  All in all, a great overall experience. I am curious to taste what else CK has to offer for lunch and dinner!

If my nocturnal adventures cross paths with Shady's, then it's safe to say that I will have some office-roaring stories the next day, as well as a hangover that will last until after lunch. Every rose has its thorn.  Every great review of the Old Fashioned's are absolutely correct. I ask for mine with a dash less bitters, as Shady's makes them a little spicier than I prefer.  Come with some quarters to shoot pool and jam to one of the best Jukeboxes in town!

After being sat and neglected for approximately 15 minutes, we left and were delighted by the friendly service, great food, and overall very cool concept that is Joe's Real BBQ just down the street.   Thank you for making this review so easy. That is all.

This place is legit! A friendly and efficient government service. As a taxpayer, this makes me somewhat hopeful, though not reallyz.  I packaged a box with my items and went straight to the counter, with no line. The guy told me if I put the stuff in a flat-rate box it would be $5 cheaper. Sweet! I thought it was already in a flat-rate box, but apparently not. He grabbed one for me and transferred the items.   It's quite a paradox. If USPS had a good business model they would be pulling in more revenue to get themselves out of the red, but who wants to be upsold at a USPS? Not me. I often try to avoid USPS's and opt for private industry just based on principle, but this place is so close to me, and remarkably good. It's the needle in the haystack.

You can literally make a day out of this place between all the shops, restaurants, and casino action. Don't let the thought of shopping on The Strip keep you away! The options and prices at the Miracle Mile will satisfy all walks of life. Oh, and they have a huge self-parking/valet garage attached right on Harmon Ave!  I got 50% off everything at The Gap on Black Friday. I'm a happy boy.

I'd like to assume most 'dining active' people in the Tempe/Metro Phoenix area would know that just because La Bocca is on Mill Avenue does not mean it is like other establishments on Mill Avenue. For any tourists or visitors reading this, I say this because Mill Ave is associated with being rowdy and obnoxious, which is perfectly fine for the college scene. However, La Bocca is a refined wine bar with a customer base not like the ones seen on the stereotypical Mill Avenue.  The restaurant itself is very pretty. The main dining area is very comfy with high ceilings, candle lighting, and seating conducive for more intimate dining experiences. The street-side patio is great for people watching, but it's obviously louder during the night. You may also have a vagrant asking, "Are you going to finish that?" The patio couches around the corner are my favorite places to lounge, relax, eat fancy cheese, drink organic wine, and think about my first world problems.   I've only dined here a few times, and every time I've had the bruschetta accompanied by a bottle of wine or two. Light eating, but absolutely delicious!  What I think La Bocca needs to work on is their communication of specials. There are no table tents or chalkboards visible to the main dining room to let diners know that Sunday night is half off all bottles of wine. If you have specials on other nights then I don't know them after dining there a few times. Maybe the server says it in their spiel, but leaning on the side of overcommunication is not a bad thing,  All in all, La Bocca is a very cute restaurant. Yes I said cute. It's a nice date spot and the bruschetta is executed well.

I'm sort of embarrassed to admit, but this was my first In-N-Out experience! First of many. Growing up on the east coast, I frequented Five Guys and until this experience, had been too stubborn to try In-N-Out.  "Watch and learn," Stacey said as she spouted off the order. She's a pro. 2x2 Animal Style, Animal Style fries, drink substituted with a Neapolitan shake.   The food was great for the price point. I still prefer a Five Guys burger, but the Animal Style fries, and Neapolitan shake were fantastic!

These hot dogs are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Need I say more?  My friend introduced me to this place the other night after our time at the Yard. Now I'm sold. Apart from an authentic Chicago dog I grew up on, these are the top dog. Yes, I rate hot dogs. That's normal right?  You must stop!

Hanny's does it right.  Whether you're stopping in for an after work drink, or painting the town red, the drinks and vibe at Hanny's are sure to please.  First and foremost, the bartenders are spot on. They're so cool and collective while shelling out cocktails. It's very enjoyable to watch the reserved professionalism. Ask for Wayne or Matt, you won't be disappointed.  I love the music the DJ mixes on Friday and Saturday nights. Put me in a bar where they're mixing Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin with EDM and I'm a happy boy. It creates an atmosphere that makes me stay longer and enjoy one too many of their fantastic $5 martinis.   In conclusion, Hanny's nails it on all aspects one wants in a bar--service, atmosphere, and drinks. Oh, and the restrooms are pretty sweet too.

Hanny's will forever hold a place in my heart....and my liver. My after-work abode. My home away from home. It's the consistency that's key here, and it's what's kept me coming back again and again.  The Old Fashions and the BLT are unbelievably good. Try them both together to gauge your manliness.

Serendipity: (noun) the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.  We came here by chance (because the other restaurant had a 45 min wait), but nothing was beneficial. You should change your name.  They stop serving breakfast after 11am. I repeat, they stop serving breakfast at 11am...at the crossroads of probably one of the highest concentrations of foot traffic in Las Vegas. It's tough to wake up in Vegas. I just wanted French toast :'(  There's only one reason to be in this human sized doll house...The frozen hot chocolate. It's absolutely delicious and fun to share.  However, if it's good food you want, or a glimmer of a menial smile, you're better off going somewhere else.   It was tough watching my Reuben sizzle in the window for literally 11 minutes. I wanted to grab it, because the OH had a flight to catch, but I didn't want to be 'that guy'. We became the 'waiters', instead of the patrons.  Skip Serendipity 3 if you can. There are much better places near.

I will start off this review by stating that I do not frequent spas. I have been to two spas for a total of two times, so I am no connoisseur. Both times have been couples massages with my girlfriend, wherein we have undergone treatments and regular use of facilities. What I do consider myself very seasoned in, however, is customer service and analyzing operations, as I would hope my reviews would reverberate.  This day was a very special day, as is any day that begins with me at a spa. We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday, and a daylong spa adventure was just what we needed.  We arrived promptly at 9:30am for our 10am massages, and were greeted by a few very cheerful spa staff, who, with my quick mention while making the reservations a week ago, wished my girlfriend a happy birthday, and we were on our way to our respective locker rooms. I received the quick rundown of the facilities by a very professional gentleman who appeared to be one of the managers. It was 9:35am and it was time for pleasure.  I quickly slipped into something more relaxing and explored the facilities. The inviting hot tub with a very picturesque desert mural adorning the wall set my spa adventure in motion. I exited the healing waters before I got too wrinkly, and walked a few short steps to the large vacant steam room. With each breath I became more relaxed. Inhaling the hot steam, exhaling the accumulation of toxins from my lungs, and best of all, not having a glimmer of thought about work--the ultimate relaxation. After the beading turned into profuse perspiration, I rinsed off in one of the multiple waterfall showers, and relaxed in the room, where I turned on Pioneer Woman and waited for my massage therapist, drinking organic limeade, and wishing I had time to cook brisket like Ree Drummond.  My massage went just as expected, and I emerged a much more tenderized version of myself, primed for some grill marks in the late afternoon Arizona sun. We retired to our respective locker rooms, and again I went through the hot tub and steam room routine as I chugged the cucumber-infused water. I was disappointed there wasn't a private pool specifically for spa patrons. The Hyatt Regency Gainey Ranch has a FABULOUS private mineral pool, which holds a competitive advantage over the Agave Spa. Nevertheless, we walked across the sidewalk to the 'adult pool', adjacent to the Kierland pool complex, and were immediately greeted by some highly attentive staff members. I believe Chris was our attendant, and he did a wonderful job in ensuring we were both properly hydrated, with our Long Islands and Mojitos never running out. He was very professional in his speech, and overhearing him converse with his colleagues, he seemed to be a team player. Kudos to him.  The 'adult pool' left a lot to be desired. It was really just a hole in the ground. No waterfalls, no swim-up bar, no cool grotto areas. Just plain. Again, a far reach from the facilities at the Hyatt Regency Gainey Ranch, but the service in this area was its saving grace.   After a few drinks and some nap time, we eventually made our way to the pool complex complete with a lazy river and slide. Again, service here was great and Leslie was very quick to assist us with whatever we needed. Consider adding french fries as an automatic side for the cheeseburger. I can imagine 90% of your customers wonder where the fries are when their cheeseburger arrives. The facilities were fun, and the lazy river was a nice touch as well!  In conclusion, the spa facilities are very good, but the service helps to carry the Agave Spa as a contender for top spas in the Valley. Please send my regards to the aforementioned associates who helped make our day highly enjoyable.

I've been a monthly unlimited user for a few months now. In that span I'm guessing I've probably received about 20-25 washes. Way more than the average person should get, but just the right amount for us 'Clean Freaks'. I consistently frequent the 44th St and McDowell location, as it is close to home, and the service professionals at this location are wonderful.  A basic wash will run you a measly $5, or you could upgrade to the unlimited starting at $16 month. This makes total sense to upgrade if you're getting your car washed every weekend, or more. Plus, you get to fly through the Fast Pass lane and point and laugh at all the schmucks waiting in line.   Keep some shammys in your trunk to dry off your car in one of the many covered parking spots. Complimentary vacuums are provided at each parking spot as well. Clutch!   Tip: Don't be the person to blare your music while vacuuming out your car. No one wants to hear your poor taste in music.

Wearing quality dress clothes is very important to me and my position, and Brooks Brothers gives me the confidence I need to look good and feel good. It all started when I was 16 and my dad bought me my first BB shirt at the Madison Ave location in NYC. Homecoming was a week away and I donned a pink slim-fit shirt which complemented my date's dress perfectly. I have been allowed champagne tastes from an early age to which I will forever be grateful.  This review is not a review of the quality of Brooks Brothers products, but rather of a certain individual at this location. Everyone who's anyone knows there is no doubting the exceptional quality BB has been crafting since 1818.  I have encountered this certain individual twice at this location. Both times, this less than stellar representative, has been pushy, hovered around making me feel rushed and uncomfortable, and made what was perceived to me as a sarcastic comment.   I always know exactly what I want. 16.5/35 slim fit non-iron dress shirts, both button cuff and French cuff. Easy. I am a frequent customer, more so online, but nonetheless I love to see the products in store. But when I go into this beautiful location and am pushed to buy the three shirts for $229, it just puts me off. I know how the industry works, and I am aware of suggestive selling. Duh. But this is Brooks Brothers, not Macy's. This is the handcrafted sports car, not the assembly line produced economy car. This is the luxury segment of men's fashion, and I expect the associates to be ambassadors of their brand.  So when this hipster looking associate, who isn't even wearing Brooks Brothers clothing, follows me around the store like my shadow, making suggestions as to what is fashionable, I just want to leave, and spend my money elsewhere. He is not an ambassador to your brand, and as a loyal customer, I am irked that you think he is. I inquired about whether BB had more of an English spread collar, to which your associate said, "We don't carry those because they aren't really in style." The hipster couldn't be further from the truth. Companies like Charles Tyrwhitt have been gaining market share because they embellish the 'proper gentlemen' look--nothing that this three-sizes-too-small, tortoise shell glasses wearing, poor representation of your brand knows about.   Let's go Brooks. Tighten up the shop. You've been doing it well since 1818. Now is not the time to let off the gas. I find it hard seeing myself return to this location with this schlub at the helm.

I literally stumbled upon this place after a long NFL Sunday day-drinking session with a buddy. My fantasy team let me down again and I needed to wallow in a large bowl of ice cream.  I've been eating a lot of ice cream.   The place smelled fantastic. Just like freshly baked wafflecones. I'm not even sure if you bake your own there or if it was a wafflecone scented air freshener, but dang that was good.   I ordered the Nutter Delux and was pleased. A little stingy on the toppings, but great nonetheless.  A tip to everyone: Don't be a ice cream taster abuser. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7S9kJEfvI0  Cya again soon.

Old fashioned, hand dipped ice cream will forever be a bringer of joy.   My first official job was at an old school ice cream shoppe in York, PA, where I worked for four years along with other jobs until my studies conflicted with my work schedule. It was the best job I have ever had. This job taught me the value of a dollar, and how having a passion for service results in more money and a feeling of self-fulfillment. My parents liked it because they had a never ending supply of ice cream in their freezer.   "Don't come home unless you have a hot fudge sundae."  Yes, Dad.  So many great things have already been said about Churn, so I will just reiterate what has already been said. Churn rocks! Grab one of their awesome delicacies and enjoy them on their patio seating in the rear of the building. I particularly love the  S'mores sundae--it's huge, the graham crackers are fresh, and the butane torched marshmallow is its cherry on top, so to speak. It sucks there's only valet, but I'm glad there's parking nonetheless.  The service was exceptionally friendly, and the gentleman behind the counter told me I could sample anything I wanted. I refrained as I thought, "What would Larry David do?"  5 stars for a top quality product and great service!

I have frequented Thirsty Lion many times both by myself and with friends, and have always enjoyed it, but have not written a review. My apologies Thirsty Lion.  The bar is beautiful to look it. With over 50 beers to tap, beautiful flat screen TVs, attractive  and personable bartenders, and a beer list like a Tolstoy novel, what's not to like?  I've had the pleasure of enjoying the NW Pub Burger, one of TL's Signature menu items. The horseradish and peppered bacon combo was superb! A well prepared Reuben sandwich is the way to my heart, and the Classic Reuben I have had at TL did not disappoint. If a behemoth Reuben or burger aren't your things, then be sure to try one of TL's many entree salads. My personal favorite is the Grilled Steak salad, with a large portion of tender garlic marinated steak, Gorgonzola cheese, red onions and a chimichurri sauce. It is a winner if you don't have a hot date after eating it.   I plan on trying many more things on the menu.

It would be remiss of me not to mention how distasteful my Peppered Bacon Cheeseburger was the last time I ate here. Salt and pepper is beef's best friend. The overly soggy fries didn't bode well either.  Don't worry TL, I still love you and all of your endearing qualities. However, in conformity with full disclosure, I have to dock you 1 star, because honestly, now I'm apprehensive to come here solely for the food.

Sephora came through in the clutch.   I spent a good amount of time perusing Miracle Mile Shops for a last minute Christmas gift for my younger sister. I really had no idea what to get her...I'm a bad brother. I can't keep up with these things!  After burning through an exorbitant amount of scent strips, I thought Ralph Eau de Toilette was a good choice. I know my sister appreciates a good perfume. Shouldn't we all?  She loved it, and I'm still brother #1.

What a playful little dive bar!   Let's try to look past the hodgepodge of an interior (which may be difficult), and focus on what TLW does well.  TLW does well at getting me soused. The bartenders are quick with the drinks, and are really good about cocktailing the lounge areas. I always had a tasty cold beverage in my hand.  TLW does well with the 'play section'. I could play foosball for hours! It's fun, competitive, and you could make it into a drinking game. The skeeball and foosball are great ways to interact with other patrons, especially of the female variety.  All in all, it's a great place for my friends and I to pregame. I'll definitely be back.

The Arena Poker Room is probably the best card room in Arizona due in large part to the friendly competition, variety of tables, exciting splash pots, an awesome TV layout, and the newly added Poker Audio Wi-Fi. Service can be slow sometimes, but I'm there to play poker so it doesn't bother me. I also met Phil Helmuth one night!  I picked up NLHE my freshman year of college after a good friend of mine told us about some successes he was having on online tournies. Over the course of the summer while we were both parking cars and waiting tables at the country club, he raked in around $16k. I couldn't learn the game fast enough. It's easy to learn, but it takes a long time to master. I spent the next few years grinding and honing my skills.  The Arena Poker Room fires on all cylinders. Good luck! But don't be too lucky...

This place is a gem of a hotel lobby bar. I'm sure they hate being referred to as a lobby bar, but it is what it is. It's owned and operated by Kimpton, but with the atmosphere and offerings comparable to other successful gastro-lounges in the  Phoenix area, I think this place would also do well if it were a stand-alone operation. Come for a cocktail, or two, grab some 'gastropub tapas', and wash them down with another cocktail, or two.   Service at the bar can take longer than you'd like, but understandably so. The mixologists aren't just shelling out drinks, but rather, handcrafting cocktails that fire on all cylinders--presentation, taste, and price. I love the bourbon-heavy menu, with the Lawless and Old Belle being my go-to cocktails. Yea, they're up there in price, but Old Fashioneds are $6 on the HH menu Mon-Fri.  As stated in most reviews, the Kimchi Pork Belly Sliders are pretty bomb! Most of their bar menu items can be ordered in different sizes as to promote sharing and sampling of more menu items, a definite plus.   Unfortunately, I think the bartender told me the kitchen was closed when I was there on Sunday. I think I hit the lull between lunch and dinner service(3-5pm). It was definitely a bummer. Of course I don't know what your numbers look like, but I hope you have all the variables factored into your equations. I would've stayed and ordered another drink if I had food to go along with it. One drink alone would've covered an hour worth of kitchen labor. You should consider posting a sign that says,  "We apologize to our patrons Sat-Sun 3-5pm, but our dreadful attempts at saving four hours of labor per week result in a disservice to our customers. We'd rather you eat and drink elsewhere."  All in all, 5 stars for the drinks and food (when I can get it). 1 star deducted for teasing me with a cocktail, and not pleasing me with food.

Pizza and Prosecco is one of my new favorite combos.  We came here late Tuesday night for some pies after just stumbling upon it while walking around the Palazzo.   Our server, Victor, was very helpful in suggesting a pie for us. Sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, fresh basil leaves, and jalapeños (just on her half). Nothing out of the ordinary. Just good ole fashioned pizza toppings.  The pie itself was great! Came out piping hot and it was very large, and I believe we ordered a small. We wound up boxing a few pieces that we couldn't eat, and helping out a man on the street. Karma.  Grimaldi's. Solving the world's hunger problem one slice at a time.

Steak 44 was the apogee of a majestic Saturday spent at the spa and lounging poolside. Through word of mouth and reading other rave reviews, I knew dinner would be good, but I wasn't prepared for it to send my palate to heaven.   Steak 44 was SO good, in fact, that I find it hard imagining myself eating a steak from any other restaurant! I do not exaggerate when I say their bone-in Rib-eye was the best steak I have EVER eaten. 22 ounces of pure bliss cooked medium per the Chef's recommendation so the marbling could melt into the steak. Add in some lobster mashed potatoes and baked cream spinach, and you have pure food porn.  The hostesses seemed a bit dazed, as we arrived for our 8:45pm reservation. My finely tuned F&B ears picked up some confusion in the seating arrangements, as we waited awkwardly for about 12 minutes. Something about a large party being broken down and a couple already sat at 606, the table where we were supposed to be sat. Nothing major, but then again, nothing that your customers, especially at such a nice establishment, should be hearing. But after this little setback, the food and exceptional service provided by John blew us away, and we had a wonderful evening!   If Steak 44 wasn't on your bucket list, it should be now!

There's not much to say about a DMV. Expect to wait a long time, deal with lethargic government employees, and feel the pain of forking over more money to the gov't.  This was my second time at an Arizona DMV, as I was having a title transferred and registering my car in AZ, lest I get pulled over by the AZ police.  I was pleasantly surprised to see this government office with hours that actually coincided with that of the American populace--M-F 8-5. I arrived at 8 so I could be into work at 9, and I was. The process was smooth and cost less than I was expecting to pay, and that's always a good thing. Giving the government less of my money is always the goal.   Compared to other DMVs I've had the pleasure of wasting my life in, this ranks middle of the road. PENNDOT in Pennsylvania is utterly terrible. Do yourself a favor and take a Xanax before stepping foot inside. However, the DMV in Clark County, Las Vegas is surprisingly efficient, especially for the extreme volume pumping into that place.   Adding a coffee station inside the waiting room would detract from the perceived wait time and be a nice touch as a whole. Get on it gov't.

Does anyone else fist pump when an unexpected check-in offer appears? Squid Ink Sushi provides Yelpers with 50% off the purchase of your first beverage.  We stopped in around 5pm for some Happy Hour sushi and wine. We sat on the patio, which wasn't the best choice with the constant noise of the Metro buses stopping directly in front of Squid Ink, and the vagrants who could hit you up for fifty cents so they can "catch the bus"--but that's not Squid Ink's fault.   I'd like to recognize our server Stephanie for the great service received. She was very personable and timely with everything.  We had the Tempura Calamari appetizer, which was satisfying in regards to the freshness of the squid and the complement of the spicy aioli, but the batter was just bland and lacking in any form of seasoning. We then split the Horry Fook and Philly rolls. Horry Fook roll had great texture with the firmness of the jumbo shrimp and the crunchiness of the tempura breaded jalapeño, but again the tempura just lacks in flavor.   Unlike most places downtown, Squid Ink has Happy Hour seven days a week from 3-7p.

I don't always go to Chop Shop, but when I do, I add unreasonable amounts of sugar into the iced tea. I always binge on the iced tea, as there are usually four fruit flavors to choose from. All joking aside, I really like Chop Shop!  To the outside observer, my eating habits may appear to be disgusting--riddled with too many late night Cheetos, insane amounts of candy, and an over abundance of red meat. I like how Chop Shop makes me feel like I'm eating healthier.  The kale Caesar with shrimp is an absolute must! And the grilled tri-tip is best as a wrap. With juicy pieces of steak, plenty of lettuce and vegetables, and just the right amount of horseradish, the tri-tip wrap provides plenty of protein in a substantial, but otherwise healthy meal.  The Tempe location is great, with both nice indoor and outdoor seating options, but be wary of wait times when classes are in session. Enjoy the summer slowdown!

The wonderful reviews of Bei were all of a sudden verified when we walked through the doors to multiple staff members looking up from what they were doing to smile and greet us.  Our server, Manami, was so friendly! After we had narrowed down our selections to the Arizona and Volcano rolls, she suggested the Checkerboard Roll, which was the piece de resistance of the evening! The combination of the tuna, Escolar, shrimp tempura, and wasabi aioli was absolutely delicious and I look forward to having it again soon.  Thank you for the great service and delicious food!

Avoid. Go somewhere else. Me thinks not.  This bar is the only conceivable place for Michigan State fans to huddle on gamedays. At least it's better for them to be here than anywhere else.   I was here on the first college gameday weekend and four of their big screen TVs behind the bar were not working, which just screams complacency to me. How could management/ownership allow that to happen on one of the busiest weekend coming out of the summer slowdown season in Phoenix?   Other bars down the street were utterly packed. Some even had a wait! This must mean there's been a continuous disregard for customer service, there's better gameday/weekend specials, and people have developed a loyalty elsewhere.  Service is lacking and inattentive, pints are never filled completely, and a lack of decent specials all mean I will never be here again.

Local business openings always excite me. It's been great to watch V's, and the ownership, from opening day to now, hone their craft and create a loyal following by providing great customer service, attention to detail, and satisfying the need for another barber shop in downtown Phoenix. I see this customer loyalty increasing further when the shop cuts down on turnover.  One of my favorite sayings when it comes to service is, "Make everyone feel like they're the only one." Serve the masses, and make personal connections while doing so, and you'll not only rake in the money short-term, but plant the seed to create a loyal following who will promote your business for the long-term. The staff and ownership at V's share in this philosophy.   I think it would be beneficial to create some form of customer loyalty/appreciation card--that's both the marketer and consumer in me talking. Who doesn't love being rewarded for being a frequent customer? And who doesn't love having their shop frequented? It's a win-win!  All in all, V's has all the old fashioned treatment you'd expect from a neighborly barber shop with all the modern luxuries of giant HDTVs and $2 local craft beers. I always went to the one in Arcadia, close to my home, but since the CityScape location opened, I've been hooked. Bravo to the attention to detail!

I hate to buck the trend, since I have no doubt the Cultured Pearl is a fabulous dining experience. Unfortunately I did not stay after our server, who was very pleasant, informed us they were not serving alcohol the remainder of the night, and probably the rest of the weekend. We appreciated the notice and took our business elsewhere.  An AZ Liquor Control Board infraction is the only thing this could be, which must have occurred just before we had arrived because everyone else was nursing drinks.  There is no excuse for this. Lack of training, and ignorance of liquor laws is a lethal combination for any restaurant, and particularly one in an area of such a young demographic. Loss of revenue plus fines. Ouch!  I will hopefully improve my rating after my next visit, but in the meantime, this 1-star review will serve as a reminder of what happens when you get lazy and don't abide by principles.
