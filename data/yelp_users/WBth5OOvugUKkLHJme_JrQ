I've tried time and time again to like this place, but the pizza ,,,hmmm..is mediocre at best...the pazookie ice cream cookie is great and so is the atmosphere..

Been into Indian food lately, a friend suggested this place..i was skeptical because its hard to find good indian food places..however once i tasted the food i was delighted, i have finally found my favorite indian restaurant in Phoenix. The food is very flavorful & rich..

Great dealer to work with, if your going in for Sales or for Service...  When it comes to sales I'd highly recommend dealing with Dave Schnirch ..Direct# 480-538-3846 if your looking for a new or used Porsche, this guy is one of the best salesman i've encountered & really knows his stuff & will take his time with you.  As for Service Department Dan Sheridan Direct# 480-538-3892  is an excellent Service advisor & a former Porsche tech so knows what is up,  & is willing to take the time to trouble shoot issues with his customers & will never try to tac on additional repairs as some service mgrs at other dealers usually do.  As for Dave Zoloto (which i believe was finance mgr at the time) , i only talked to him once a couple of years ago & he treated me like i was some young punk that couldn't afford a Porsche & was there to waste his time, total douche as i'm on my 2nd 911...but again maybe he was just having a bad day!   All in all, great dealership to buy from & also get your 911 (when under warranty) serviced there.   ***PS*** The angry guy Dion E, below   complaining about paying high hourly rates must be living in La-La land...What do you expect when you take your Porsche to be serviced at the dealer?? Of course rates are high at ANY DEALER, thats how things work genuis, thats why if you can't afford them or want to save you goto an independent mechanic...very unprofessional childish review, look at all his 9 reviews all for dealers & calls all of them thieves & talks about getting ripped off.. not sure how yelp lets people like this stay on, you only leave bad reviews for businesses all over the valley?? what a J erk Off.. the guy probably drives a 1999 Boxster anyways ;)

Chompie's used to be one of my favs, i used to eat there all the time a couple of years ago, today i went to the shea location, which i always used  to goto & it was pathetic..ordered the "aaron" sandwich, the sweet potatoe fries were so bad & soggy even the waiter said, taste those & tell me if they are good before i said anything..they replaced & still were horrible..the bread tasted stale..there was literally a smidge of cole slaw instead of actually having cole slaw on the sandwich..it was just horrible..i wasted my time & my apetite on junk..oh ya plus $25 for a bad time!  ps: the place is looking pretty run down & didn't smell too good inside (which another reviewer also mentioned)  i'm not sure if management changed or what.....how ever the service was good & the manager came to ask me if the food was good after the waiter told her about the fries being so bad, but i just said, yes all is good thanks...didn't want to sit and complain!

Ordered flowers through an online site, Cactus flower was the local florist which would deliver, they called & said couldn't deliver on the day it was scheduled, said for sure next morning, next day...nothing, i call at noon, they say its on the truck, i call at 2pm then at 4pm and still nothing...& they were also very rude to the online service that would inquire with them...FLOWERS ARE FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS, IF YOU CAN'T DELIVER ON TIME DONT EVEN ACCEPT THE ORDER!

I don't know what happened to this spot, atmosphere is still great, but I was there for lunch a few days ago, ordered vegas roll + spicy tuna & they were both terrible..literally my friend and I had maybe 1 or 2 rolls each..bland, no taste & stale..hard to find good sushi in this town these days..

Been to a few dentists, DR Katz is the best i've experienced & his staff is amazing..the practice feels very cozy & friendly.   Dr Katz has gone as far as calling me himself to checkup on me after getting a crown put in, now thats a Dr that cares about his patients!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! This place is great! First of all the owners are a very nice Lebanese family, the husband and his wife are the ones always working, they are so nice and friendley!  The food is amazing, their beef shawerma is very different than anyone elses, they actually use FILET MIGNON for their shawerma, which is a nice change sometimes from regular beef shawerma.  Their Baba Ganoush is so good, you might eat your fingers after it *Egyptian saying, sorry, lol*

If your looking for a nice painting to place in your house, this seems to be the place, i was in there today and was actually very impressed, the person working there "DAVID NOONAN" was very helpful and had great taste. They will not only sell you a painting at a descent price but if you ask for David Noonan come out and professionaly hang it for you for a small fee.

Excellent dealership, i went in to take a look at a few vehicles, greeted by Joe Girvin who was one of the most knowledgeable & patient sales people i have ever dealt with, Joe made my experience shopping for a car great & took his time explaining the features, pros & cons of each vehicle i was looking at.  Ask for Joe Girvin if  your shopping for a Mercedes at Schumacher & want a top notch sales experience.

SIX is not the greatest club, actually its not really a club its more a lounge, i have given up on all the scottsdale clubs now that i'm a bit older, but if i do go to old town SIX and PCL and maybe Crown Room are the few places i would go.   The crowd has changed alot since 4-5 years ago, but this is evident all over scottsdale.   I would recommend sunday night or wendsday night, when they play old school hip hop music its also a great time.

Was able to get a reservation for Valentines day, this place is "private" & Small, you really feel like your in someones dinning room about to have amazing italian home cooked food...i loveeeeeeeeed the food & the atmosphere...this spot is a hidden gem!  Service is 5 star & food is great..i was surprised when the bill came, you'd expect at least a $100 bill from a place like this, but it was much less, great value & had plenty of left overs!

Love this Gym! i was working out at another Gym in Scottsdale, paying $100 a month, and it was more of a "show off" spot that it was a gym. Was referred to Maximum by a friend, its very inexpensive, great personal trainers & its never too busy!   I'd say its an Old School, rugged & raw Gym..you go there to WORK OUT!

Great place to eat seafood, now i'm from Alexandria, Egypt on the meditteranean born and raised, so sea food is in my blood, i was very impressed with this place, the rockefeller oysters were great, and the atmosphere is very cool.  The place is a bit loud and busy but that just adds to the experience!

I hate to write a bad review but this place really rubbed me the wrong way, About a year ago i was looking for a 5-Series BMW and they had one online, i went to check it out, and they were not exactly on the ball, they took forever to find the keys, didn't know much about the car ect..which was ok, that was not a big deal. I came home and i called the owner and asked him about the car, he said it was in perfect condition and had never been in an accident and he's give me a good deal on it, mind you this was the OWNER of the dealership, i asked him about the car fax report and he said he would supply it and that it was clear!   So just to double check i ran a carfax and it came out clean, but then i ran an AUTO CHECK *similar to carfax but more detailed* and found out this car had gone through the auction as a suspected salvage vehicle, mind you the car did not have a salvage title or anything so i don't understand what the exact issue was but obviousley THERE WAS AN ISSUE which the owner tried to hide from me, now if i would have bought this vehicle then tried to sell it a few years later i would have been screwed on resale value when this came up!   I hope euro imports does not try to do this to all its customers because sooner rather than later their reputation will be ruined...worse than it already is!

Ok so i'm Egyptian and my Grand mother is Lebanese, so i love both foods, Byblos in Vegas gest 4 stars because i must say the appetizers weren't that great, the spinash pies and the meat pies weren't good and the humus was mediocre!  BUT THE REAL ENTRE WAS DELICIOUS, I orderd the Chicken and Kebab mix, it was great, and my uncle tried the Kofta so i had a bite of that as well, it was also delicious!

If your in the mood to be around people in a nice atmosphere, and share great food this is the place, even though it could be a bit crowded at times, the place has a great "ambiance" i'm not into their sushi but their other dishes on the menu are great!    I also find it a great spot to take a first date, i don't know why, but its my numero uno spot for dates! lol

Its not only a market, its also a restaurant, their Beef Shawerma is UNBELIEVABLE! and their service is great, If you shopping for mid-eastern arabic food you can find almost anything there, from Tahini to Molokhiya *traditional Egyptian food*  The neighborhood its in is not very good but thats ok!  again TRY THE BEEF SHAWERMA!

Went to this place today with great expectations, NOPE! BIG DISSAPOINTMENT! First the rice &amp; fried bananas they brought out were cold, old and stale...then came the meats, definitley not fresh, the only thing that tasted good was the Roast beef, otherwise nothing was good...maybe cuz the place was empty the food was not fresh, but i barley ate, paid over $40 and left still hungry because the food was no good!  I hate to slam places but this place deserved this slamming!

Excellent food & service- Chicken is so fresh & the workers there really show that they love their job.

Very honest and full of information place. I picked up a 745Li & before buying had it inspected at Babbits, Eric made it very easy for me to get it in without prior notice & they inspected everything. Then after i ended up buying the car they ended up applying my inspection fee to an oil change so i got an oil change Free from them, its a service they offer, GREAT!

This place is great if your looking for a nice middleastern meal, and also mid-eastern atmosphere, it has taken off since oasis moved, and they have revamped the place, i would highly recommend it, its very authentic, and if your looking for "Halal" "Kocher" food they have it as well!  The owners are lebanese and cook in true lebanese fashion!   You can also sit down and enjoy tea and a nice Shisha *Hooka*

This place has real professionals working there, couple of year ago my Porsche 911 was hit in a parking lot & they painted the fender & it was perfect,.  so in the past month   i've gone through a couple of cars, i called Tyler who i usually deal with (great guy, knows his stuff)  E63 M6 that i had them paint and install a roof & trunk spoiler on, they did an excellent job, then just last week took them a custom front bumper for a 650i to have installed & painted, they finished the job within less than a week & the paint and install was perfect, mind you this car was silver & silver usually isn't easy to match!   Thanks!

I was impressed with this place, even though i'm not into bland foods like turkey sandwiches and so on, i still liked this place, the american  Grilled cheese (substitute the pork *yuk* with Turkey)  with a side of tomato soup is GREAT!, Just do the "Dip" and you'll love it!   A little expensive and the service is so-so, the waiters are young kids that seem like they came out of the "Dazed & Confused" movie set! But the cooks are hard workers!

Huge thumbs up to this place, i don't understand how 2 of the reviews are so bad? how does one person say the meat is microwaved when its actually cooked infront of you either on the barbaque if its kebob, ect..or on the Big skewer for Shawerma?   The owners are from Istanbul, Turkey and i have been there myself, their food is very authentic and has a great taste. Turkish food is very similar to Arabic, mid-eastern food and its full of spices and taste, ect...  Their red special secret sauce is incredible and i have not had it before!   I suggest you try this place!  Also i don't get how the owners are not friendly *although i have heard this before from someone* they are usually very nice to me, i think sometimes if you go at night when only 2 people are working and they are very busy they are a bit tense!  Try this place you will love it, order the Beef Shawerma!!!

First let me say, i'm not a Frozen Yogurt guy, i'm an Icre Cream, more GELATO guy..my friend told me to try this place & i did, thinking it would be like other yogurt places & plain old just have no flavor...I WAS WRONG! This place is GREAT, clean, excellent service...i got the Salted Caramel & put some nutella as a topping & BAM..all this by the way was only $3.50 i'm impressed at what you get for your money!!   1 more thing, TO THOSE THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT PRICE...Have you ever been to a Gelato shop? This is much cheaper, this isn't a Klondike Bar folks + STOP FILLING UP YOUR CUP & TOPPINGS LIKE A P I G then when its time to pay you complain oh its $7-$8...my total was $3.50 and i had a nice amount that filled me up  highly recommended!

I must say, i'm very very impressed by this place! I'm originally from Alexandria, Egypt so we have alot of greeks & greek food there, this is the closest i've ever had to authentic greek food in the USA :) Really feels like home cooking, just the right spices & ingrediants....The staff is super friendley...and the price is very low compared to anywhere of this stature..less than $40 for 2 of us with an appetizers & even had a full leftover plate! if i could give this place 10 stars i would!

Had some parts i needed painted & installed on my 911 & had a tough time finding a reliable place in or around Phoenix that i'd trust to do the kind of clean job i wanted, i was recommended to check Elite out & couldn't be any happier.  These guys know what they are doing, if you need a body kit, or paint etc these are the guys to go see, specially if you drive a lambo, ferrari, Porsche, etc..  Chris, Johnny & Chip did a great job on my car..

This place is great...i was skeptical at first, because i thought "microwavable" would suck! however i gave the place a chance & i've been eating these great already portioned tasty meals for the past 2 weeks..  The food has alot of flavour & i'm so surprised it still tastes so good in the microwave..this is perfect for bachelors, people on the go, or trying to manage their weight.  Service is excellent as well. Love the concept!

Mediocre job..Got my Porsche 911 repaired there, service was "OK" car needed a simple front bumper fix no structural work- They ordered a new OEM front bumper for my car, and installed the 3M clear bra on it (my old damaged front bumper also had 3M clear bra)  Upon receiving the car, i noticed after a couple of days that the bumper color did not match correct, its silver (ofcourse not an easy color to match) I'm a reasonable guy & i understand that brand new paint on plastic will not look the exact same as older paint on metal...but there is a clear difference very noticeable to anyone, the color on the bumper is a shade lighter than the rest of the car.  I went to the shop, spoke with the manager & he tried to convince me its because of the 3M clear bra, i had the bra on my damaged bumper & there was no difference in color, 3M is clear- doesn't reflect, sun, ect & even if so the color should not be that noticable.  I went to 2 other shops which confirmed the color could have been matched much better, called Greulichs, emailed their customer service & gave them many chances to take care of this issue, but got no help, so have no other choice but to post online.  In conclusion if your a car guy & care alot about your car, specially if your an enthusiast do not get your car fixed there, job is mediocre, i'm not driving a pinto, i'm driving a porsche which i worked very hard to buy & maintain.

This place is a gem! Was looking to get my BMW M6 lowered with H&R springs & get a front lip installed, was getting ridiculous quotes from other shops, I was recommended to call Jason at Parts Score, they got me in rite Way, charged me half what other shops were quoting & did an excellent job.  What impressed me with this place is the attention to detail they pay..Jason the owner takes great pride in his work.  These guys also do service on cars, I will be bringing my BMW here for all my service.   Thanks for the great service & reasonable prices.

Great source for vaping, walked in based on a recommendation today, Taylor the owner was very helpful, i'm new to the vaping thing, and had many questions, he took his time & went over everything with me.  I got to try out many different flavors & devices till i found one that suited my needs & price range, Taylor didn't try to upsell me or pressure me into buying anything, he was informative & guided me towards the best product for me.  Overall all A+ experience here, i wont be using any other shops for my vaping needs, good luck with the business, from what i've seen, i'm very impressed. Thanks
