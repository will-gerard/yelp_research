I've heard a lot of good things about this place but never got around to trying their food until today. Food was amazing and everyone was really friendly! I will definitely be coming back and I'd recommend this place over Pita Jungle anyday! Thank you for the yummy food and awesome service!

After a long day at work,  i just wanted a quick bite to eat. I ordered a small order of plain chicken wings with hot sauce on the side and a small dinner salad. My husband and I split the dinner and it was the perfect portion. All the employee were so friendly and happy and the food came out relatively quickly. Their wings are the best,  hot and crispy! Glad to have a great pizza place right down the street!

Made a reservation online and come to find out their online booking system had a glitch.  We had the email confirmation on our phone but nothing showed up on their end.  End result was that we would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated in the hibachi area.  They didn't offer to do anything to keep us besides say sorry so we didn't hesitate to stay there and wait.  We walked right across the street to Firebirds and had a wonderful dinner. Walked right in to Firebirds w/o a reservation and was seated just like that.  Osaka, please think about having more than 2 chefs on a FRIDAY night as no one in our party of 6 will be returning.

Their donuts are really good! I brought these donuts into the office twice and they're gone in less than an hour! Way better than any Dunkin donuts or your retail grocery store. Their thai tea is delicious, real authentic fresh brewed tea! There's nothing i love more than to support local businesses in the valley with good food!
