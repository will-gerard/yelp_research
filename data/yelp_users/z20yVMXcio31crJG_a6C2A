Place is garbage the only thing that made it worth a star was the devils ale thats it.... I was there w.my girlfriend and we ordered food it was cold and to add to it one of there employees got off work while we were eating and decided to make dirty remarks to my lady ... He was drunk and making an ass of himself and his company.... Will not be returning i almost had to punch this idiot and our server just thought the situation was funny avoid this place

I give it 3 stars because the food was delicious, our server was so sweet and accommodating. She always kept drinks coming and checked on us frequently. We moved to the bar afterward so as not to take up her table.  We were greeted by a bartender that was such a snob, i get it you have a bitch face but that does not entitle you to be one. She snarls as she takes our order. Demanding id which i couldn't find right away. She instantly assumes we were never carded and proceeds to tell the busser and other bartender. As i frantically dig for it she barks, who was your server. Ok whatever quarrel you have with your coworker does not involve me, why don't you focus on your customer. I finally find it and she ignores us the rest of our stay as if we ruined her chance to reprimand a server. Fucking awful bartender service. Period. Dot dot  Ps my Id was out of date dumbass
