Small place, maybe room for a dozen sitting customers so i got mine to go. Food is good i think i dealt with the owner, he was really nice all his employees seemed to be in a good mood which made for a pleasant atmosphere the 3 minutes i waited for my food. To recap, good food, nice staff and good prices. 4 stars. Thanks!!

Many places make burritos however Burrito Express hits the spot much better than its competitors with its oversized and delicious burritos.

This store stinks. I needed to make some copies for my small business from a file in on my SD card and they could not help me. If this mom and pop store wishes to compete with larger office supply stores they should invest in equipment such as memory card readers that have been in existence for almost a decade . When I asked about emailing them the file, like I have done several times at OfficeMax, they told me that the one person who has access to the email account was not in . When i asked about passing them the file via my phone and a usb cable they told me "its against policy". My experience was frustrating and a poor one.

Solid choice for lunch. This restaurant is consistently great with their food and even when at the peak of the lunch rush they still get my order quickly (which is typically for me and a coworker). You won't be disappointed eating here.

I went in the other night on a calzone craving. I was a little disappointed to see how limited the menu was in that department and to top it off the restaurant wanted to nickle and dime me for every additional topping. By nickle and dime i mean $1 or $2, per topping, for small or large calzones, respectively. The most frustrating part was how small the large calzone was. It was maybe 7-8 inches in diameter, the dimensions of a small calzone at other Italian dives.   The upside is the interior has been completely redone. The comprehensive makeover they gave this place really made it nice for the tier of restaurant this place is in.   I havent tried other items on the menu but im the kind of guy who typically orders a calzone so its unlikely I will choose to come back here. Sorry

Aqui encontraras un servicio excelente! Very friendly staff and delicious food as well. Food is made to order in plain view which i always enjoy. I tried the carnitas burrito enchilada style and loved it.

Delicious pizza! I just enjoyed a slice of pepperoni and Italian sausage with the perfect amount of grease on thin crust. Best part, it cost me less than $3.50. Will frequent for lunch.

If you like everything over cooked then The Devils Advocate is your place. I came here with two friends and our fries, onion rings, hamburger buns and hamburger patties were all over done. And the water tastes terrible. The only reedeeming quality was the plethora of different NCAA football games on Saturday

I decided to give this place a second chance and i was pleasantly surprised. The food was cooked very well and was delicious. The waitress i had was very attentive and my overall experience was a good one. I'll definitely be back for college football games this year. Go Sun Devil's!!

Came in looking for some Mexican City food, and they got it!   I ordered the Huarache with Al Pastor which was huge AND delicious. The inside was real simple, but i go to a restaurant for the food so i didnt really care.   I recommend this place if you're tired of wannabe Mexican restaurants that typically offer the same fake americanized version of the real deal!!

Is the pineapple supposed to be hard and the orange juice taste a little spoiled? Other reviews seem to agree. I should have double checked this place before spending over $10 on breakfast.

My wife and I like coming here for the authentic tasting elote and other Mexican snacks/desserts so for the quality of food I'd give four stars but I'm taking two away for poor customer service. The two employees seemed to be more occupied playing around and wasting time than taking care of a lengthy line of customers. Several times we were asked to repeat our order and I saw the same happen with other customers. Overall a negative experience.

Just as good as the one I visit often in west Mesa. If its your first time, try the Breakfast Burrito Supreme.
