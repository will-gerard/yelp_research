I hate to be a Negative Nancy, but I just want to persuade people to run from this place. For one, food is way overpriced (my street taco platter and soda was over $10!), second, the food was sub par and relatively flavorless, and third, the environment of the restaurant was appalling (it seemed like people were living in the back). Other things to note: the salsa was watered down and flavorless, there are no napkins except the two they give you, and the food took forever to come out.

Best tacos in Phoenix! I spent a summer in Guadalajara, Mexico, and these tacos remind me of a gourmet version of their street tacos. Soooo delicious! I go here at least once a week! I recommend the Pernil tacos and the Carne Asada, but I just recently tried the Empenadas and found them to be the tastiest that I've ever had. The people are great there and the cocktails are exceptional. They have some very unique cocktails like one with wasabi, but also have old favorites such as house-brewed sangria. Come at Happy Hour when everything is really cheap: $3 tacos and $6 cocktails.

If you like spring rolls, you have to go to Rice Paper. For those of you who don't know, spring rolls are the non deep-fried type, rather, they have fresh lettuce, mint, cilantro and such inside a rice paper shell. Think of it as a Vietnamese Burrito. At Rice Paper they have it set up almost like a sushi bar. You have your choice of about 20 different spring rolls (all priced under $4). You check what you want and they make it in front of you. The spring rolls come in all types from sushi grade tuna, to fried crab, to shrimp and vietnamese sausage. Each comes with a special dipping sauce catered to the roll. If you don't like spring rolls, I recommend the Bahn Mi, which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries. Or try the Pho noodle soup, or even (I can't believe I'm saying this since I hate salads) the salads are great. They make cocktails infused with lychee fruit like the Lycheejito (a twist on the mojito). You can't go wrong here, and the great thing is is that everything is so refreshing and healthy, you feel great afterwords, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day.

While searching for a Ninja/T-Rex restaurant I stumbled upon this gem. It more than satisfied my carnivore needs despite letting me kick chairs in half. It's not always about me. Now on to the food. The first time we were there we had the Cuban sandwich and the pulled pork Sammy. Holy Velociraptor Fellas! Took me from 6 to Midnight if ya know what I mean. I've had a lot of pulled pork sandwiches across the south and that was either the best or the second best I've ever had. Thank you for the cheese on it! The chef is a super friendly, albeit Cowboys fan, who grew up outside of Cincinnati and spent his later life in the south. The food speaks this. I've never seen anyone stupid enough to put chili on spaghetti before except Cinci peeps and ASU students who are 3 bongs in, but I tried his chili, and SQUEEZE MY PINKY TOE it was amazing! I'm running out of my big words here, but just like Courtney Love, give this place a shot! Oh, and if you go during the day, watch for the funniest bartender ever. Miss Jodi! She goes by Tigerhawk and she'll make you laugh your ass off like an old Paula Abdul video.
