I called today to ask for a quote on mounting and balancing two tires for my Honda Rebel. I knew which tires I wanted (Pirelli MT66) and was trying to find a labor quote because I planned on purchasing my tires online. The man I talked to was very rude. I had only asked for a quote and the first thing he told me was to call back after I'd called everyone else. He then told me that the total cost of the operation if I didn't buy tires from him would be too low for him to be interested in my business. I don't mind being told that my bill would be too low for him to want to work on my bike (understandable) but I do mind being treated poorly for asking questions to determine if I'd like to give him my business.   This is the second time I've called them in the last two years. When I first purchased my Rebel (two years ago) I called them after a couple months to get my 1000 mile service and the response was similar. I had hoped that the attitude would change but I guess not.  Perhaps this business isn't paying attention to the economy? I don't think there is anything wrong with trying to get the best bang for your buck and I AM willing to pay for stellar service. However I'm not in any mindset to fork over 200 dollars so I can be treated rudely.

I love Old Chicago! I started going here for Karaoke with my buddies and it has certainly become a favorite hang out. The servers are all super nice and are very familiar with their products. Canyon is a great bartender and is very accommodating. Their beer selection is constantly changing and they do a pretty darn good job of keeping the crappy beers off there. My current favorite is the Isolation which is part of their mini winter tour.   The food is pretty good for bar food. I love their Cesar salad dressing and the small plate Mediterranean salad is great. The pizza is also pretty good but you can get better other places. I also think they do fries PERFECTLY. They are the medium ones between small and steak fries. Their tarter sauce is also really good (important if you like fish and chips!).  On Sunday starting at 9pm they have Karaoke and it's totally worth going! I love the crowd and the woman who runs it, Sheila, is awesome. :)

So for dinner tonight I decided that I was craving Indian food. I have tried several places here in Tempe and while I enjoyed one of them, the rest were fairly mediocre. So I decided to go to the Indian restaurant with the highest ratings. So Royal Taj became my destination.  I was definitely looking forward to my meal, and trust me it did not disappoint. The service was excellent and just the right amount of attentive and time spent away from the table.   No one ever just refilled my water, they asked and then polity reached to get the glass. I was even offered more ice!  As for the food I bought Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice) and garlic Nan. The rice that came with the curry was perfectly cooked. So was the Nan, which was simply delicious.  The curry was amazing. The sauce was rich, and flavorful. The spice level was perfect. The chicken was nicely cooked and tender. It was not dry.   This was hands down the best Indian food I've had since I moved to Arizona.

First I want to say that I went to Top of the Rock during restaurant week and was able to purchase a whole meal for $50. The restaurant was beautiful and driving up to it was very fun. We got a table right by the window and looked out over Tempe for our meal. As far as the view goes it was amazing and I would go back just for that.  The inside of the restaurant was lovely with a very unique type of glass lodge decor. The vaulted ceiling is beautiful.  The hostess was very friendly and seated us quickly. Our server on the other hand was just a bit annoying. He was loud and swore occasionally. Now while I don't have anything against swearing it was weird for it to happen here, even though the words were very mild (hell, damn). He had another table right next to us and they were so loud. He contributed to it and eventually it just became something my boyfriend and I watched while eating our food because it was just, well, there. It was annoying because most of the rest of the restaurant was empty and I really wanted to move because of how loud it was. We should have asked to move but I always feel awkward about that.   Now the food was a completely different story. It was amazing. My boyfriend had their Scottish salmon dish and I had a filet of beef. Oh my it was amazing! My food was so good I would willingly pay $30 for it again. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the fingerling potatoes and the thin slices of sausage. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce meshed well with everything on the plate.   I really enjoyed the food and after the loud table left and out server went and bothered someone else I had a great time. I would definitely go back but if we get the same server I'll ask for someone else!

Not very good. Lady behind the counter was really standoffish while I was asking my questions. Best part of the whole meal was the side of sliced avocado. Beans and rice were unflavorful and the beans taste canned. However they gave me a ton of food, so if you like quantity over quality this place might be good for you.

Super expensive. Half this stuff you can get online for 3/4 cheaper. The people who work here are also pretty rude and almost none of them are knowledgeable about their products. It's like they get their stock from adamandeve.com and then hike up the price 60%.

Service is iffy. Sometimes I get a great waitress, sometimes a terrible one. The beer is great but the food is overpriced and some dishes are really not good. My friend had to spit out the calamari. I thought the quesadilla was gross (had the taste of processed cheese).   Some dishes are good though. Burgers are good, the beer bread is great. Their pork and bean dish is very good (but the beans are bland).  And the parking situation, oh lord, don't get me started. Prepare to park 1/2 a mile away on the street. Seriously. And turn in your side view mirror or some drunk college student will break it off.

I've been to Khai Hoan two times now. The first time I got the number 5 and the second time I got the number 15. Both were excellent!  The service is fast, we didn't have to sit at the table for long before someone came over and took our order. Even getting the food didn't take to long. The beef in the number five was perfect, sliced thin and rare when it was put in so that the broth could cook it.   The broth wasn't overly oily and you get a big plate of 'fixing's (like bean sprouts, lime and basil) for your soup.  Overall, this place was great--though I think the soup needs more meat on average.  I will go back for sure!

Delhi Palace is hands down one of the best Indian places in Tempe. Only beaten by Royal Taj (which is truly wonderful and I suggest you try it).  The service is so-so. Half of the service men don't come by regularly but there is at least one guy who is super attentive and does pretty well about re-filling drinks and finding out if you are doing ok.  I've had many of the dishes there including their Chicken Tikka Masalla, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo. The garlic naan is fantastic. The best dish of what I tried was the Tikka Masalla. The vindaloo is off somehow, it used to be my favorite dish back in San Francisco but I haven't found an Indian place here in Tempe that does it right. However, their Masalla is amazing. That sauce with garlic naan is MMMMM.  The decor is very authentic, so is the smell of the restaurant. As with a lot of good Indian places it can get kind of cloying but if you are into the Indian culture and food you can easily get past it.

Green is probably the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to. And I've been to quite a few. Living in San Fransisco for two years gave me the experience of restaurant hopping.   When my friend asked me to go I was quite hesitant. I didn't believe that good vegetarian could be done outside of a food hub city. Boy was I wrong.  We had the vegan chili fries, the green burger and the ice cream. Every single item was amazing. I was basically licking the chili out of the bowl. And the soy ice cream was better then any Haagen Dazs I've ever had.   I wouldn't consider myself a vegan/vegetarian or even a person who is generally interested in that kind of food. But Green was completely worth going to, and I highly recommend it to anyone--vegetarian or otherwise!

For a Wendy's, I really like this one. Everyone is always really nice to me, and the store is super clean. No complaints.  Also, these chains need to start posting their hours!

Terrible--to be honest if the mixed smells don't scare you away the obvious addition of food coloring into everything breaded should.  I've eaten here three times and every time I've been violently sick, off two chicken dishes and one pork.  Any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant is better then this!

Horrifying!  I tried Chopstick express because they deliver to my apartment. I was going between it and another place--what a mistake.  I ordered Sweet and Sour chicken and moo shu veggies. Everything smelled great when I got it but I was keenly dissapointed just by opening up the boxes.  My moo shu pancakes? Tortillas. I'm not kidding, actual tortillas. Not rice paper, or won ton wrappers. Tortillas. And as I opened up the box with the actual veggies in it, it compleatly broke and smashed all over my carpet.  Moving on. The quality of the chicken was the worst. My first bite was filled with fat and the veggies wern't even cooked. (Huge pieces of raw pepper and onion).   Absolutly horrible, I will never, ever order from here again. It was a waste of 23 bucks!

God the food is SO good. The gobi manchurian is my absolute fav. I will go back to this place over and over. Trust me, even if you're a meat eater you WILL enjoy the food here!  Only thing I'm never too happy about is that the service of the manager is really not nice. He's confrontive, rude and doesn't like to admit his own mistakes. But since I hardly ever see him, who cares!?  Seriously. Go. Eat.

As a resident of San Fransisco for almost three years I can say easily that I know Thai food. I lived an breathed it. I know what good Thai tastes like and I can easily judge the worth of a Thai restaurant by the taste of their pad Thai, or their yellow curry.  When I moved to Tempe I was unsure that I would ever even find passable Thai--let alone good Thai food. So after trying three other Thai places (on other people's recommendation) I hesitantly tried Lemongrass. I ordered the Yellow Curry with an extra side of white rice.  It was fantastic--everything was cooked perfectly and the curry sauce tasted exactly like it should--and had the correct thickness (not to thick but not runny at all).   The only complaint I have is that the potatoes are obviously not cooked in the sauce and they should be (you can tell because outside of the outer layer of the potato pieces the potato isn't yellow). But even though they weren't cooked in the sauce (or even half cooked in the sauce) they were cooked perfectly, so the complaint is fairly minor.  I highly recommend this place.

I've been going here with my two best friends for several years now. We always sit at the sushi bar and we always love what we get. The only times I haven't enjoyed this place as much is when I sat at a table and had to deal with the regular waitstaff. So I highly recommend (if your group is small enough, or you're on your own) that you sit at the sushi bar.   My favorite roll here is called the Sunshine roll. It has a bright, light flavor that I have never found anywhere else. The salmon plus lemon is a perfect combination that makes me wonder why no other sushi restaurant has thought of it.   If you're into something spicy, try their version of the Las Vegas roll (it's my second favorite). The fresh jalapeno and dot of Sriracha takes this roll from great to f****** amazing.   Frankly, there is something to be said for a place that consistently puts out the same amazing product without ever slipping in quality. For that alone this place should be recommended.   Though fair warning: this place is not cheap. There are cheaper sushi restaurants in Tempe/Mesa/Chandler but I guarantee that none of them taste better than this place. So if you're willing to lay $10+ down per roll, come here.

I live right next to this place and I've always wanted to try it. I finally went in today and found it pleasantly packed. The restaurant smelled good--though a person could be turned off by the run-down condition of the restaurant.   I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was quite good. The tortilla was firm, and delicious. The guac is clearly homemade. The beef was of good quality but not that 'shredded' it was more like chunks of easily pulled apart beef.  I enjoyed what I ate but I'm still left with the feeling that the food was missing something, I don't know what!

I've ordered from Silver Mine Subs four times now. Every time I order I get something I like and many things I don't like. And it doesn't seem to be getting better. Because of this I think I'm done with Silver Mine. Here are my reasons:  The Good: -The Veggies: I've never had bad veggies. They are always fresh and quite generous. I am excluding the avocado. -You can order late either over the phone or online for delivery or take-out.   The Bad: -The Bread: it's overly soft and squishy. While it holds up under sauce it gets really squishy really fast and is quite tasteless. -The avocado: well, it's more like avocado spread. And it's tasteless.   The Ugly: -The chicken: it's often full of fat and questionable tasting.  This place just isn't good enough to get my business anymore. If the food was more flavorful and the chicken wasn't so gross I would be willing to try the food again.

Best. Taco. Salad. In. Phoenix.  Seriously, that stuff is amazing. This is probably because they make all of their own salad dressings. I get 2 or 3 of them on the side with every salad and that works so well for me. I get to taste a range of amazing flavors, appreciate the talent of their chef, while moderating the amount of extra calories I'm eating.  Another plus? The steak on it is amazing. Lean, pink in the center and tender! I really have to give it to them for producing such an amazing salad. Puts everyone else in PHX to shame.

As far as this type of restaurant goes I vastly prefer Genghis to YCs. There are a lot of reasons why I prefer this place. One of which is that their meat looks much better then what YCs puts out. Also because it's not frozen there isn't a ton of suspended water content which means that when you get your food back it tastes better and the sauce isn't overly watery. Not to mention there is no freezer burn!  The veggies here almost always look more fresh then what I've come across at YCs. I love my onions and here they are crisp and freshly cut.  The portion sizes are a bit smaller, there is no denying that. But as far as flavor goes this place takes the cake from YCs.

The Facility:  MCACC is a fantastic 2 pound (and 2 outside location) system. They have two pounds one in Phoenix (2500 S. 27th Avenue) and one in Mesa (2630 W. 8th Street).  The facility in Phoenix is MUCH larger and nicer. This is because they got to make a whole new facility in the last couple of years and they replaced the old pound that they were using. The one in Mesa was built in the '50s and wasn't made for adoptions, so it is much darker, smaller and over-all depressing.  The Phoenix pound has kennels A and B which are adoptable dogs, C-H are all strays/owner holds etc and are not adoptable. Any animal inside is adoptable (this is where they keep puppies and cats). The facility also has many 'Meet and Greet' rooms for potential families to meet these cuties.  The Mesa pound has 4 wings (I think), and mostly has dogs. They seem to have fewer small dogs then the Phoenix pound. And the  Mesa facility seems to have more 'huge' dogs.  The PHOENIX shelter is CLOSED on Wednesdays. The MESA shelter is CLOSED on Thursdays.   The Volunteers:  In both locations look for people in RED shirts that say volunteer. These people know a lot about the adoption process (I'm one of them :) ). The ones in blue are there for facility and animal care, less on the adoption side. But they can help you, it's just not their area of specialty.   The Animals:  Most animals up for adoption are strays. However a good portion are from owner surrender. When you look at a potential animal for adoption all of them had to pass two types of tests: health and behavior. The health test is to screen for OBVIOUS only medical problems, the behavior test is to screen for things like aggression and fear.    Generally, any animal put up for adoption is in good shape. A lot of them may have small problems which are easily fixed (both behavior and health problems).   When you adopt an animal you get a free vet visit within 10 days to a vet of your choice. The facility will give you a list. MCACC can not verify the health of any animal but they do do their best.  PLEASE consider adopting a shelter pet. Animal boutiques and pet stores OFTEN get their animals from shelters or backyard breeders. MCACC gets a ton of purebred animals, and the selection in breeds is extensive at any given time.    Adoption Fees:  These change semi-regularly due to environmental conditions. They are very reasonable and include: all necessary shots, registration for dogs (not puppies or cats), and a free vet visit.

So I went to US Egg because I really wanted an omelette. So bad did I want an omelette. And I figured, what better place then a restaurant called Egg!  When I got there there was a 5 minute wait at noon, which was fine. I was seated and got my water pretty quickly. I had already looked at the menu and I got the Hawkeye. Which is chicken, avocado, tomatoes, bacon and jack cheese. I added onions.   It arrived fairly quickly and was amazing! The hash browns and English muffin were really good too. (I mixed the omelette stuffing that had fallen out with the hash browns--yummy!)   However, the service was bad. Pretty bad actually. My waitress seemed to almost ignore me. It took almost 10 minutes to get a side of salsa from her AFTER I asked for it (which took forever as well).   Then, when I'm not even halfway through my meal she brings me my check. I was sitting there, fork halfway to my mouth when she just sets it on the table, says "no rush" and walks away. I don't know how long she's been a waitress but you NEVER bring a check when someone is still eating. Certainly not when they have just reached the middle of their meal.  She never came back until (she decided) it was time to pick up the check. I had been sitting there, with my credit card in the sleeve, with an empty plate (silverware neatly on the plate) for more then 10 minutes before she took it.  Needless to say I did not tip. Which is sad because I'm a 25-30% tipper on average.   So, overall, very good food, very bad service.

Worst service I've had in a long time. The waitress was snotty and literally couldn't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill (gave her a $20 bill and she sat there like 'um, 20 minus 12.44 is....uh....uh....'). Pho broth was overly salty. It took more than ten minutes to get my bill and I had to go up and ask for it. I will never, ever, go back.

I was really looking forward to eating here this morning when I got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking. I had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast.   They had a great selection of hot tea. The people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions. The French toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy. They also proved that they can really cook eggs well. They also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us.  I also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was AMAZING.  The service was super fantastic! I will definitely come here again. :)

I'd heard a lot of good things about this place, and so I drove out there yesterday to see what 'it's all about'. Pulling up to the place encouraged me. Holes in the wall are often great finds, and believe me I was in the mood for a hot dog.   The people who were there were awesome. They had great personalities and one of them offered me a chili sample when I was going between two things to order. It was great--not the best, but great.  I ordered the chili dog and I asked for no cheese--they only carry processed cheese and I hate that stuff.  It was on my hotdog anyway when I got it (and keep in mind I was the only person in there and I thought I had been pretty clear about what I didn't want). I took a bite and I couldn't eat anymore. The cheese was all over and disgusting. The meager hot dog bun disintegrated under the weight of the chili and the whole thing doped out of my hands in a soggy mess.  Very disappointing.  So while the service was good (except the mistake) the food left me hungry. I immediately left and went to dinner at Sweet Tomatoes--so I could get the cheese taste out of my mouth.

Ok, so I wrote a review after going to Lobby's the first time. I had a bad experience with the food but a great one with the employees.   After receiving a very nice letter from one of the managers (or owner, not quite sure) I returned to give Lobby's another shot. For the first round I got the Italian Beef sandwich. Here's the rundown:  1. Beef was very very tender and there was no fat present. It just fell apart. Lovely. 2. Very, very salty. I stopped eating everything except the beef because of this, and I still refilled my drink twice. 3. The bun withstood the juice much better then the hot dog bun had. I was pleased.  So as far as that goes, I dunno. It would have been better if there wasn't so much salt. I give it a C+.  But because at this point I had tried a hot dog, and a sandwich I figured I should at least try the burger before writing this place off (again).   Good decision!  The burger was fantastic. Run down:  1.The beef was perfectly cooked (and seasoned).  2.The lettuce was crisp and fresh, the tomatoes were thick cut and fresh.  3.The grilled onions were amazing.  I took one bite and realized that Lobby's Beefy burgers are amazing. And I would definitely return for one of these. I give the burger an A+.  And as always, the service was nice and friendly.  So if you just want a good burger, and don't care about the other stuff (fries looked good but I didn't get any), Lobby's may be a good choice. But if you want a hot dog or sandwich it may be best to get that somewhere else.  PS: The store is VERY clean.

I love Eddies.  Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here is why:  1. They are open till 5am and DELIVERING until that point. So as far as late night delivery this is a winner.  2. Their unlimited toppings extra large pizza for 8.99 is a fantastic deal. The vegetable toppings are tasty and fresh (and copious!), the meat toppings are delicious. One of these can easily feed 3 people.  3. They deliver fast. I've only had one mistake and one late delivery and I've ordered 20+ times.  4. They buffalo chicken sub is super good! I always get a salad instead of fries and the salad is always fresh and crisp.  5. They keep you in their system. So you don't have to tell them all your addy information every time. Which is great if you have a long addy or difficult directions.  So this place is definitely worth a try. Even if you've eaten here before, try it again. It's worth it.

Wow! Robbie's is fantastic! It is hard to say what this restaurant and bar hasn't done perfectly. The decor is amazing, filled with anything nad everything that has ever inspired Irish culture. Looking for something awesome? Then check out their bar. It was brought over from Ireland and was the actual bar that a famous IRA leader was shot in. The bullet hole is still there in the glass. Talk about classy and interesting!   The food is great. The fish and chips are pretty darn delicious and I've heard the lamb stew is to die for. My boyfriend loves the shepherds pie and almost always gets it when we go there (if he doesn't get fish and chips).  Their bar is extensive and they have a lot of Irish whiskeys from 8 dollars a glass to the vintage at 30 bucks a pop. I don't drink whiskey but for my boyfriends birthday we went there and he pretty much tried everything. Robbie's doesn't carry the shit whiskey and his selection allows a new person to try things for reasonable prices.  The only complaint I have about the place is very minor. They have a server there, a blond foreign woman (her accent is pretty thick). She can start to get really rude. I've sat at one of her tables twice and both times she got a little snippy after I requested something. This last time it was when I ordered the burger and asked about sauces. Now I don't rate this into the review because she is only one person and I think she has the ability to be great if she could just 'chill' a bit.  Anywho, 5 starts Robbie, this place is great!

This restaurant was the first one I tried when I moved to Tempe. I had spent 6 weeks in the Bahamas and though the regions are not the same there is some similarity--and I was craving Bahamian food. I was hoping there might be some crossover that would satisfy my craving.  I have since been the restaurant many times and every time it's fantastic. The baked goods are amazing--they melt in your mouth! The family that runs the store is so friendly and every time I go in I have a conversation with someone.  I highly recommend the lunch fish sandwich and the plantains. My friends love the Ox Tail and the smells this place emits is almost as good as the food.  Totally worth trying!

I was quite skeptical of Republic Ramen at first--not because of how it looked, smelled, or what I had heard but because why would there be a restaurant charging 8 dollars for what I can make for .14 cents?  Man was I wrong. My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful.   The menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!  And the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen.   The goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.  Though I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths.

I love this place. Why? Because they seem to be open every time that I want a hot dog. Every time.  I get their special, it's a hot dog with tomatoes, onions, beans (and normally mayo but I don't get the mayo). I then sauce it up with Tapitio hot sauce and dig in. Fantastic!  This cart is clean and always well patronized. So if you're up late and want a great meal, head over here.

I read the reviews and thought I should check this place out. It sounded good and I've never been to a Thai Buffet so I thought I would go.  The place is definitely a hole in the wall, but it's the good kind!  The place was clean and unique looking. The owner (I don't know her name) was super duper nice. And she made sure we had everything that we wanted.  The food was excellent. We started with a strawberry salad and this hot and spicy chicken soup with lemongrass and mushrooms which was absolutely fantastic. Then she gave us a plate of two different kinds of chicken wings and filled up our plates with rice, noodles, and 4 different types of curry. All were fantastic!  And as a special finish she made sweet rice with mango and HOMEMADE pumpkin custard! And a generous scoop of ice cream on the side. It was so good that I think I'll be going back JUST to eat that!  Cost was 9.99 each and absolutely worth it!

I ordered Mister G's last night (Sunday) because there were one of the only restaurants open. I've tried almost every late night delivery place in my area at this point but for some reason I always skipped over this place.  I wasn't expecting much, but I ordered the stuffed shells and half a pastrami sub. The prices were reasonable for what you get, and everything was quite tasty. The pastrami was perfectly seasoned and there was plenty in the sub.  I really recommend this place. Haven't had the pizza yet but I expect it will be good!

I have continued to eat here after my initial review, and it just keeps getting better.  The wings are AMAZING. However, if you are getting delivery they do not punch holes in the container and steam makes them squishy. I have tried several time changes (for how long they are cooked) and 15 minutes (which is 5 min over how long they normally cook them) is the best time for the wings to still be crisp when they get to your door.  The pastrami is great, the garlic bread is amazing, the delivery drivers are awesome! Their pasta is great.   Still haven't tried the pizza but it looks good.  Mister G's may be my favorite delivery place in Tempe.

Consistently amazing. Consistently tasty.   Best thing in the house? The Arizona burger. Fresh guacamole, fresh jalapenos and the most amazing chipotle sauce I've ever had on a burger.  Do you want a good burger? Come here. No place better in Phoneix.

So I really enjoy the Oliveo Grill. So when I looked on their website and they weer pushing their new store Oliveo Pizza I decided I should try it out. I used a promotional coupon for 1 14in pizza with 2 toppings, garlic bread sticks and 8 wings for 13.99.  The guy on the phone was very nice, so I was happy, customer service is not something that a restaurant should ignore. Especially not when they're new. So I'm glad to say that the customer service is great.  So here is the rundown:  Pizza: -sauce was marinara (I wanted white but they wouldn't do it for the coupon) and was pretty bland, it's on the sweet side -crust is tasteless, not bad and not good, on the soft side -the chicken was great and spicy -the onion was too thin but not bad at all  Grade: C- , it wasn't bad it just wasn't, you know, good.   Wings: -crispy, just like I like them! (I requested extra crispy and I got my wish!) -there was no extra sauce in the bottom of the container, and I generally want some to roll my wings in before eating - the amount of sauce on the wings was fairly thin, which may be because they bake the wings to finish and it probably cooks off -I ordered sweet and spicy and the sauce is really just sweet, the spice is super mild  Grade: B-, they have a lot of potential to be great, but they really need more sauce.  Bread sticks: -flavorless, just a smattering of flavor on the top (they dust them in some kind of Italian spice mix)  -thick, soft and crispy around the edges, pretty good -marinara was barely above lukewarm when it got to my place  Grade: C+, because they are just bread sticks and the only way to make them really great is how much butter/Italian spice is on them, they were fairly disappointing. However, if they stepped up the spice they would be great because the bread really is cooked perfectly.    Overall Grade: C+  Overall Thoughts: This place has a serious potential to be good because they already have great customer service and they KNOW how to cook things, it's just the 'finishing' of the food that really drops their grade. I also like that they deliver late.  I'd be willing to try again in a month or two to see if things have changed. :)

I don't know why this place has gotten so many bad reviews. This place is right next door to my apartment complex and I've been in here several times. The atmosphere is fun--though a bit on the older side. All of the staff have been really friendly to me and my boyfriend and I have no complaints on that.  As for cooking times I think that they are normal. Not too long or too short.   I really like their pizza and I get little personal ones all the time. They come with one topping and I think that's pretty great! Their garlic knots are pretty good but could often use more seasoning and more marinara! They give you one cup but there really needs to be two or three.  All in all I have no complaints and I think that this place is actually a really fun neighborhood joint.

The food here is amazing.  The authentic smell and limited menu make this place a real keeper. I've tried about ten things on the menu so far and I have no complaints. The servings are generous and the garlic naan is amazing!  Prices are extremely reasonable, generally a bit cheaper then other Indian restaurants in the Tempe area. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is inviting, I highly recommend this place!

Best shrimp tacos in Mesa! Hands down. Everyone who works here is so darn friendly. I love this place! Best Mexican food in PHX as far as I'm concerned.

Called today, Mike the mechanic was very nice and had a great attitude. Unlike Eastside Performance and Apache Motorcycles (who were both exceedingly rude when asked for a quote). I will be getting my motorcycle tires mounted and balanced here. I'll review again after the service!

Salty, salty, salty.  Could have been so much better. I got the grilled cheese and it was so salty I had to gulp down my lemonade just to eat it. Which is sad because it was cooked perfectly and looked so tasty.   Maybe it was just a one off accident?

So, I posted a review last week or so and it wasn't very favorable. At the bottom I suspected if my poor food experience was a one-off fluke. I'm happy to say that that seems to be the case.  Both times that I've been to Pesto Prima the customer service was excellent. The women in the front were friendly, answered all my questions and even gave me a sample when I was curious about the mayo content in the chicken salad.  I got the same thing I had before, a grilled cheese and a curry chicken salad which (from reviews) seemed to be a favorite. This time the grilled cheese was perfect, and the curry chicken was excellent.   I'm glad that I had a reason to come back, and that my earlier review proved false.
