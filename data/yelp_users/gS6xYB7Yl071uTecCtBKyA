Love this place.  Not much to look at but the tub and hot water over looking the desert is the bomb!  Recommend to anyone who loves hot springs.

I have to say this place is not what they advertise.  I thought I was going to get a facial and a massage and it was all machines.  No real people and the machines suck.  Then you had to buy a ridiculous membership to try the others.  What happened to real therapist?  I wouldn't recommend this if you want either.

This place has the worst customer service.  You walk in and they act like your disrupting them.  I don't say thank you or even appreciate your business.  Most of the food is decent, the prices are way too high.  I paid $50 bucks for 2 large pieces and they were not worth that price.  But being treated the way they do every time I have gone in there I wont go again.  Pizza Hut has better respect for the customers and they don't charge like this.  I would think for the price I should be treated like a King!
