Went there with a group I'm in.   I had been there before and wasn't all that impressed, but it has been a few years so I thought I'd give it another shot.   I had the yellow chicken curry.   It was okay.   They add some kind of thickener to the sauce, which I don't like it when thai restaurants do that.    Just let the sauce stand on its own.   You don't need to thicken it.   Thankfully, the chicken was not boiled, which is what I had in another Asian restaurant I reviewed.   Ughhh!!  Gross!!   I think twice is enough to try it out, no matter how many years in between.

Went here with a friend.    I had the "market salad," which included prosciutto, pomegranates, persimmons, among many other ingredients.   It is amazing  how putting the right ingredients together affects the dish one eats.   It was one of the "specials" of the day.   Marco, the brother of the owner, was most attentive.    The person I went with is from New York.   Marco is from NY.    He is quite friendly, and is very good at making his guests feel welcome.     My friend told me about their pizzas.    Next time I shall not be distracted by their specials of the day and order the pizza.

My friend and I went there for lunch yesterday.   I have been there for happy hour and dinner, but this was my first time for lunch.   I had the PCG pasta, and my friend had the small Bethany Home Salad.   The flavors for my pasta were beyond great.    The chicken consistency was a bit on the soft side.   Was it "real" chicken?    Dunno.   It was good, though.    I just found the consistency strange, as though it was chicken that was, what, retextured??   Notwithstanding that fact, I loved the sun-dried tomatoes and the broccoli along with the pasta.    There were crispy tortilla strips in my friend's salad that she didn't want so I put it on my pasta.   This is a hint to the restaurant:   Maybe put those strips on the pasta??   The crispness and flavoring of the corn tortilla strips were a nice compliment to the texture and flavoring of the pasta.   If her salad was "small," I hate to see how large the "big" salad is.   I thought it was large enough for a full meal, and she did, too.    She liked her salad.    I tasted it.    I'm not a salad person, but the dressing was good and the ingredients in the salad were appealing to the eye as well as the stomach.    Since the restaurant is sort of in the 'hood, I definitely would go there again.

Went there the other night for dinner.    I had the special of the evening, seafood linguine with shrimp and crab and lemon capers butter sauce, .   WOW!!   It was great.  In fact, beyond great.    I was trying to figure out how the pasta was flavored with every bite I put in my mouth.  I think I shall call the restaurant and find out.    It was the right mix of ingredients, not too buttery, which would make it oily/greasy.   The right amount of capers, which, if there's too many, overpowers the other flavors, and the right mix of barely knowing it also contained lemon.     Oh, yes, he had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.    Since he is on a "low carb" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can't give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.    No, I don't follow the white with the seafood/chicken "rule."     I like cabs.    It was good.    I shall go back, you can count on it.    I sure would like to have the flavoring mix of the pasta.   I had called the restaurant to find out the name of my dish since it was the special of the night.    I was told it used to be on the menu, and they try to mix it up.    My opinion?     I think it should go back on the menu.    It was delish!!

I'm not a runner, don't pretend to be, don't wanna be, ain't happening, but I do need shoes for walking the dog, which means walking on streets, sidewalks, up the hill where I live, which is not a trail and has extremely uneven, rocky surfaces.   I had bought a pair of shoes,  oh, I don't know, a couple of years ago at this store.   I didn't want to go to one of the "big box stores," cause I knew I wouldn't get any sort of help on what to buy.   I don't know who helped me, but he took an inordinate amount of time helping me get the right shoe by letting me walk with them down the sidewalk, around the corner, and I guess they trusted I'd return.   After doing that to a few pairs, I picked a pair to purchase.   I was told there is a 30-day guarantee, which I figured, I could walk the dog for a month, if the shoes hurt my feet, I'd return then and get another pair.   As it turned out, I didn't return them, and kept them till my feet started hurting again.   So back I went, taking my shoes I bought prior, and he helped me pick out  another pair or two.    I settled on one, and now I hope to be in business in walking the dog without my feet hurting.

Okay.    This is an update to my prior review.   Either I don't care for their "southwestern" food, or it's just not that good, but this time I tried the beef tenderloin served over pasta.    YUMMMM!! is all I have to say for the meat.    It was tender and flavorful.    Tender in that it did not have that strange consistency of beef that was of lower quality and tough, therefore, "tenderized" with I-have-no-idea what, which makes me wonder what it would do to my insides after I ate it.  Anyway, back to the review.   The pasta was not of the white, bleached to near non edible that most pasta is now days.    And it was cooked to oh, so slightly al dente.     Of course, the flavoring for the pasta was just about perfect as well.     I topped it off with a couple of glasses of their zinfandel.    I don't remember the vineyard.    I just remember it was #27 on the wine list.    My companion had some sort of chicken skewers with beans and rice.    I've had the chicken skewers before.   And beans and rice on the side is not something I'd write home about.   So I didn't taste it.     He seemed to like it so I guess that's all that counts.

Yummmm!!   Took a client there for lunch.  Both of us had salads, me the grilled chicken salad and he the kale salad with chicken.    Came out in a jippy.   Must be ready to go with a toss of the dressing.   The seasoning for the salad was perfect on both counts.    He said his was really good and mine was GREAT!     Just the right amount of crunch and veggies and dressing and chicken.   Added all together, and it can't be beat.   Love their food.    I would definitely return.   One thing I would suggest, since it is so noisy with customers, I think they can turn off the music when it is busy.   It adds to the din and makes it a bit hard to hear conversations.

Went there with my gal pals for a birthday bash.  Veronica (or was it Victoria??) was our server.    Very friendly, competent, and professional.   Since it was happy hour, we decided to try a few of their appetizers:   fried mac and cheese, pot stickers, buffalo blasts, sweet corn tamale cakes, egg roll sampler.   Huge quantities of each, to say the least.    If anything CF has going for it, it is the size of the servings and the menu selection.   I thought everything was over-fried and rather bland.   I mean, I love mac and cheese, but it was over-fried and hard.   The buffalo blasts were all batter, ughhh, could barely handle the tamale cake, couldn't say anything positive about the egg rolls, and the pot stickers were hard.   I am only giving it two stars instead of one because of the server and the cheesecake.   Our birthday gal did get a piece of cheesecake and we all had a few tastes of it.   Now, that was yummmmy!!   Would I go back?   Not if I can help it!

Took my daughter there for her birthday.    After reading the reviews, I decided it wise to make reservations.   A wise move on my part.   Even though it was in the middle of the week, the place was packed and people waiting.   I was a bit leery of going there because I assumed (wrongly!) that it would have a lot of the Americanized sushi with all the surprise elements mixed in the makisushi, which I dislike.   If I am going to have nigiri sushi, I want a bite size piece of rice with whatever fish or product I pick put on top.  I ordered the sushi dinner and my daughter ordered sushi ala carte from the sushi menu.   The fish was fresh, definitely.   I can't say any more than that.   I LOVED it!    Presentation is, of course, outstanding, as one would expect.   Ambiance is almost what I've seen in Japanese restaurants in California.    The service was attentive, friendly, and impeccable.  Darn right I would return.   You betcha..

Went to Roaring Fork for happy hour with three of my gal pals.  Darrell was our server.  Very professional and competent and friendly.  Had a few of the happy hour menu items.  All were good.  I had previously taken clients there for dinner.  Fabulous dinner and service so definitely wanted to try the HH.   Definitely a place I'd go back, and I'm sure my friends felt the same.

Took my daughter 'cause I had a Groupon.  I had the BBQ ribs and my daughter had the prime rib.   I can't say the ribs were anything spectacular.  In fact, it tasted quite ho hum and there was barely any meat on the bones.  My daughter's prime rib was anything but great.  No au jus and the creamy horseradish had waaaayyyy too much cream and barely any horseradish.   The bus boy was trying to wisk our dishes away before my daughter was even done eating.  Was that a hint that there were more paying customers out there and they needed our table???  He came back two more times trying to take away our dishes before we were done.  Someone needs to teach the bussers how to bus!  Having "saved" $20 by using the groupon and spending over $70, not worth it at all.

I went there last night after being "enticed" to return after writing a prior review that wasn't what one would refer to as all that positive.    Well, I must admit, it was a much better experience than prior.   Jeff F was our server.   Even though it appeared the restaurant was quite busy, he was very attentive.   After checking the wine menu and  giving his advice on what was a good cab, which I solicited, I started perusing the food menu only to see there were bar suggestions.     I quickly had him flagged down and he helped me order my all-time favorite, which the bartender managed to make to perfection.   Ahhhh.    A good start, indeed.     We ordered the cuda cut prime rib and the spicey broasted chicken.    The cuda cut was cooked to perfection and very tasty.   The spicey broasted chicken was flavored with the right amount of spices.   For our sides we ordered the chicken soup, which had large pieces of chicken and well seasoned.   Also ordered were the baked potato and french cut fries.    I liked the fact the baked potato was covered in spices.    No plain jane potato here!  The fries were so-so.    I think it would be a good idea to add a little seasoning to take it out of the ho hum category.       I would categorize my return visit a success and would probably visit again.

Went there for happy hour last night.    If my review was all about the views, I'd give it a 10.    Stunningly spectacular.     Otherwise, I'm giving it a four because of the server.  I'd give it a three if it was about the HH food.   I don't know if the server was sick or what.   My companion felt bad to even make her talk cause her voice sounded as though it was going.    We had a hard time getting a menu, number one.     Once she did show, it took a while to get service.   We had to keep asking the busperson (or whatever he was) for things, and he would  have to tell us he'd get our server.   She didn't bother to come back before happy hour was over, and we had to flag her down 15 minutes after it was over (She was nowhere to be found prior to that.) to order.   We definitely asked that we be given the HH pricing.    We ordered the jaded wings and the charred  edamame, and I ordered the long island.   They were so so.    Nothing spectacular.    He ordered beers.   I would go back because of the views, that's for sure.   There were a couple of musicians.   They sort of had a country feel to their music, something I'm not particularly fond of so we left, especially since we couldn't really have a conversation after they started performing.

I went here for my birthday with my guy pal.   We decided to give it a try cause I have the Passport Unlimited card, and it seemed to get good reviews on Yelp.  So why not.  WOW!!!   Was I ever pleasantly surprised.   I had the Bouillabaisse.   Lots of seafood and the broth was out of this world.   Would I LOVE to have the recipe for the broth!!   I'd make it.   My guy had the Cashew Nut Encrusted Salmon.   Of course, I tried it.   I'm not a real salmon lover, but the crust on the salmon was absolutely delish.   It was on a bed of, I think, mashed potatoes and greens.   If I was going to eat salmon, that's how I'd want it fixed.   I'm taking my daughter there.   I love, love, love the food!   If I could give it more than five stars, I'm so there.

Went there to celebrate my birthday month with one of my gal pals.  We sat on the patio and listened to Alexis Juliard.   What a pleasant surprise it was to hear him.   It was his first time there performing.    He played the guitar and sang a fine mix of tunes,   The weather was perfect.    Just a bit of a chill in the air (It was probably in the low 80s.  Brrrr!)   We had a mix of appetizers, ordering three items:  calamari, soft pretzels and macaroni and cheese with chicken.   Okay.   I don't think the mac and cheese was an appetizer, but my friend said it was fabulous.   WHOA!    We should have just ordered one item, there was so much food.   Quite a generous portion of each.   I paired my meal with a fine cabernet suggested by our server, Apri.   That's April without the "i" she said, and it sounds like "Apree."    What a fine server she is.   Very personal, efficient, helpful, professional.    Her service added to the enjoyment of the evening.   I would like to return with my guy pal for a full on dinner.   It's been a while since I had been there, but I shall return.

I was referred to Tracy's shop by my auto broker friend, Mike Mullan.  By the way, if you want to get a screaming deal on a vehicle without playing the idiotic games they place at dealers, use Mike.  But that's another review.   I backed into a concrete mailbox that jumped in my way, tearing out the whole back light package and put a HUGE dent on my SUV. Owner Tracy had my vehicle ready before he said he would and at less than half and a third of the other quotes I got.  My vehicle is a year old, and when I got it back, everyone looked at it and agreed, yes, we couldn't tell where the damage had been.  PERFECTO!!!  PLUS, it appeared they cleaned and detailed the interior.   I couldn't make it out to their shop before closing, so he brought the vehicle to me.  I "rented" my daughter's car, but they had offered to take me to the car rental place where they get a discount.  Do you think I'd use them and refer them??  I've already told my friends.

Went there with out-of-town guests cause they were staying in the west valley, and it had been recommended to me.   I had the chicken burro plate with rice and beans, he had the same version except with beef, and I don't remember what she had.   I give it two stars for the salsa, but that's about it.   If that was chicken in my burro, I don't know what kind of chicken it was.   It surely didn't taste like chicken.   And the consistency was basically unappetizing.  It came with rice and beans.   The rice was tasteless till I poured the salsa over it.  In fact, that is what I did with the burro to give it some flavor.  The refried beans is typical refried beans out of a can.   My relatives said it was good.   I mean, they were my guests.   What are they going to say.   Plus, they are from a city that doesn't do Mexican food well.   Would I go back?   A resounding no!

Went there with my honey this past weekend only because it's been around so long and had heard of it and thought I'd like to try it to see what it's all about.     Well, I'm glad I did.  And, no, I wouldn't return.  I'm surprised it's still in business what with the lack of quality and presentation of the food.    I had the half fried chicken, and he had the deep fried icelandic cod.   My chicken had a nice crust on it, but it lacked any sort of imagination or flavor.   Very bland and boring.   It came with clam chowder, which had so much flour it was hard to find the potatoes and the clams.    In fact, if there were three or four pieces of clam in the cup, I'd be surprised.    The dish also came with french fries.   Again, boring and lack of imagination in taste.   UGHHH.      My honey had the fish, as I mentioned.  It, too, had a nice batter to it, but, again, alas, lack of flavor and/or presentation.   Very so so.   It came with tartar sauce, which tasted like some nondescript brand out of a jar.   It had a tiny plastic side cup of coleslaw, which was falling out of the cup and slopped in.   Again, ughhh in flavor and presentation.     Other places close by had full and packed parking lots.  The Horny Toad was basically empty.   There were groups of people so I'm thinking there were families there from out of town.    Too bad the food is so nondescript, blah and boring.

We went here because my companion lives in Cave Creek, and I thought we'd try it.   The restaurant and decor reminds me of a small-town kind of place, you know, kind of "homey."  Paige was our server.   I asked her if the bartender could make a french martini.   (Not all places have the ingredients.)   She asked him, and said he could.   Perfecto!   We asked for suggestions as to what was good.   She gave her opinion and we selected the whiskey penne pasta blackened and jambalaya blackened.    YUMMMMM!!   Both were cooked and flavored just the way we liked it with the right mix of ingredients.   We saw a gentleman going from table to table greeting and talking with his guests.    I asked Paige if he was the owner.   Yes, was the response.   When he stopped by our table, I told him  how great the food was.  He sat down and we talked at length.    A very, very friendly person, just what one would expect in a small-town kind of place.   Paige is very efficient and friendly, and we enjoyed having her as our server.   Would I go back?    Absolutely!!

Clients of mine said they'd like to take me to lunch, saying, "Bonnie, you pick the place."  Kierland was sort of in the middle, so I said, "How about The Greene House."  Wise pick on my part.   I had the turkey on grilled flat bread.  The bread was very tasty; seemed flavored, not like the bland flat bread I've had in the past, and, yes, it is grilled.  The turkey and lettuce was delish.  I would have liked there to be more turkey than lettuce, though.  It felt a little like a salad in a sandwich.   Considering it was so tasty, I won't complain about that.  The parmesan fries on the side were hot off the fryer.  The sandwich was definitely good regardless of the amount of lettuce.   My clients had The Greene House Salad.  Well named.  Everything about it was green.  She said it was very good, and she liked the combination of flavors.   Another had the iceberg wedge salad.  I must admit, I'm not an iceberg lettuce kind of gal, but she really liked it.    Lastly, the fourth order was the Asian Chicken Salad.  He said it was quite tasty.  It looked as though it had the right amount of chicken and other ingredients.   The service was fantastic.  I think the manager even came over and asked how we liked everything.  Nice touch on a busy work day lunch.

Went there last week with a friend for lunch.  Yumsters!  She had the caesar salad with chicken and I had the pasta special.  Both were absolutely delish.  Just the right amount of salad dressing and lots of chicken in her salad and my pasta dish was perfect.  I am definitely going there for dinner and/or happy hour.  Oh, yes, we mustn't forget the service.  The server and the hostess were quite friendly, efficient, and professional.

I have been to this restaurant many, many times, esp. since I have the Passport Unlimited card, which gives me the two/one deals.  I've taken out-of-town guests there as well as I've gone with family and friends.  This place cannot be beat.  It isn't what I would consider a Mexican food restaurant, which is what I like about it.    I have never been disappointed in any of the dishes I've tried.  The wait staff is friendly and professional.  The ambience is perfect in the fact one can actually have a conversation without having to talk louder over the din of other diners.

I went to the spa because I bid on and won a gift certificate at a silent auction with Gaston Andres.     I showed him a photo of the haircut I normally get.   He looked at it and showed me a picture on the wall of a cut he said would like much nicer, but I'd have to understand the cut may be a bit more "severe" than I'm used to.    I told him to go for it.    I love my new style.     I get compliments on it all the time.   And I can actually make it look similar to how he styled it, which is a surprise for me.     His tips on using the blow dryer was the first time I've heard them from a hairdresser.   He is 35 miles from my house, but I would definitely return.

Went there last night with my daughter.  WHOA!  This place is fabulous!  Ask for Jordon as your server.  He's very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  I had the two corn tacos with tilapia.  Yummm!  Just the right amount of fish and veggies, and the flavoring couldn't be any better.  My daughter had the curry rice with grilled chicken.  Very large serving -- took most of it home to enjoy today.  (I think I'll eat it while she's gone.)  It had the right mix of spices and the chicken was grilled to perfection.  We also tried the chips and salsa.  Jordon said the salsa is spicy hot but could be toned down.  Since we both like hot, we said no to that suggestion.  He wasn't kidding!  It is hot!   I put it on my tacos, and it added just the right kick.

We went here during happy hour.  We had the cashew calamari and the Texas gulf oysters.  Loved the calamari!   Gently fried and seasoned.  Thank goodness the calamari wasn't fried to the point of hard and nonexistent.  The veggies in the rest of the dish were perfectly seasoned.  The gulf oysters were obviously fresh, and had three types of condiments, which truly added and not over-whelmed.   The Grey Goose drink on the happy hour menu was the best I've had.   Because the food and drinks and service were so fabulous, I suggested our next gal pal birthday party event be at Wildfish on the Waterfront.

This is my second review.     The first was during happy hour, this time it's for dinner. Was going to order a glass of wine, but in the end we decided to get a bottle.    It was a 2011 cab.    Sorry.     I can't remember which one, and I don't see it on the online menu.    They brought warm bread and butter, which was a nice touch.      I'm not much of a bread person.     I tried it, and it was good.   We ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna for myself, and he ordered the Pacific Swordfish for dinner and the Classic Caesar Salad to share.   My tuna was cooked and flavored to perfection.    It was lightly seared on the outside and the accompanying veggies were a perfect companion to the fish.    I don't normally like swordfish because I've always found it extremely dry.     Not in this case.    Moist and tender and most definitely they know how to give it the right seasoning to bring out its flavor.   The salad had the perfect mixture of dressing, and plated in the most elegant fashion for each of us.   The staff is friendly and oh so efficient.     The manager came over to ask how our meal was.    Always one to give my opinion, I told him it was one of the best I've had.      And, yes, I shall mention the hostess.     Of course, she was welcoming and prompt in placing us at a very good table.

Went there last night.   Definitely good food.   The server, Srdjan, was a bit on the "stuffy" side, but I suppose that's his personality.   Gets the job done and is competent and efficient.   I asked his opinion about the wine.    He suggested the J Lohr, which suited my palate exactly.  Had the calamari fritti as an appetizer.  It was good.   Not great but good.   We ordered the linguine vongole and the linguine fruitti mare.   I had the linguine fruitti mare.  Since I am not a tomato sauce fan, I talked to Srdjan about it, and he asked if I would like it changed to a white sauce, which I did.   I was great!!   Had quite a bit of shell fish.  The pasta was cooked to perfect and flavored just the way I like it.    My table mate had the linguine vongole, and I was told it was very tasty as well, absolutely no complaints.    Would I go back?   Definitely .  The food and atmosphere is great.

had the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast and my daughter had the Angus GriIIed New York Strip Steak.  The short rib roast was melt-in-your-mouth absolutely delish!  The NY strip was so so.  The meal comes with two sides.   We had the sides of  Green Chili Cornbread Casserole, Maple Chiliglazed Carrots, Sauteed Organic Green Beans, Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes.  The carrots and beans were so so but the potatoes and cornbread, YUM!  Next time we're ordering just the potatoes and cornbread.  The server was attentive and pleasant.

Went there for lunch the other day.    I must admit, I have not found a good sushi/Japanese food restaurant on the "west side" till now.   Therefore, when my companion suggested it, I went there with trepidation but thought, "What the heck.   Why not?"  I had the six-piece chef's choice nigiri and he had one of the rolled sushis, which I can't remember the name, but, you know, typical rolled sushi, which, if you have read my prior reviews on sushi, I don't really care for rolled sushi that is mixed with heaven knows what.   I did try it, and noticed it had cream cheese in it.   REALLY??  Cream cheese in sushi??   He also ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, which I found quite good.   The batter was light and fluffy and not overwhelmingly batter and one has to play, "Where's the shrimp?!"  My nigiri was good.   It was a fine selection of "chef's choice" as far as the product.  For $9, it was a screaming deal.   It came with the six pieces of nigiri, rolled sushi, a salad, and miso soup.   Quite filling for a lunch.   Too bad they don't have a closer location.   I would definitely frequent it more often.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how good this place is.     Starting with the big bowl of chips and salsa, the salsa was flavored with the perfect list of ingredients.   I ordered the Ultimate Chimichanga and my companion, the Baja Fish Tacos.    I am not real big on fried food, but the chimichanga was not greasy at all.    I ordered it with the chicken, and it also contained beans and various cheese and seasoning.    Yummm!!    My companion had the crispy version of the fish tacos.   It came with a sauce, which was completely unnecessary.     The flavors couldn't have been better.    Would I return?   You betcha!!

I have been here a few times, both for lunch and dinner.  It's a small, looks like mom and pop type of place.   I have had their bento lunch with the sashimi, tempura, and I think it's a California roll along with some traditional Japanese veggies.  The sashimi is always fresh, and the tempura is fried to perfection.  The California roll is good, but from my other reviews, you will notice I don't really care for sushi that way.  The service is adequate, not that great and not bad.  Definitely well worth eating here.

I tried Bertha's Cafe from a groupon.  WOW!!!  Is the only word there is to describe how fabulously tasty the food is.  I tried both the chicken pesto and the ham and havarti panini and the chocolate chip cookie.  The pesto on the chicken pesto sandwich was seasoned perfect, and the chicken is tasty and juicy without being dry.  The ham and havarti panini combination on this sandwich couldn't have been better.  I ate the chocolate chip cookie while I was waiting for my order.  I had planned on saving it for later, but one bite led to another and then another and it was gone before I left with my sandwiches.  And I usually am pretty good about exercising self-control, esp. when it comes to food.  Next time, I'm not even going to take a bite of my cookie so I can REALLY save it for later!!

My daughter and I went a couple of days ago for lunch.  We were using a groupon.  I ordered the "teriyaki" salmon and my daughter had the spicy tuna roll.  I must admit, I've had better at a MUCH cheaper price!!  The salmon was grilled farm salmon, very bland, and on the side was a dish of what appeared to be bottled commercial teriyaki sauce.  It was very thick and ho hum.  My daughter's sushi was nothing special.    The service was great.  I think the only thing we were paying for was the beautiful bathroom!

I went here for lunch with a client, expecting a lot.  I mean, It is Eddie's, and he has been around a long time.  I am sad to say I was quite disappointed in the food.  It was mediocre at best, and it was expensive for what we ordered.

Took my cousin, her hubby, and a friend there the other evening for dinner.   YUMMMM!!  is all I can say for what I had.    I ordered the seafood volcano.   I love the fact they don't add some kind of thickener to the sauce.   I loved the veggies and the shrimp.   Prepared perfect, and the seasoning in the sauce is something I wish I could duplicate.  I wanted to save some to take home, but it was sooo good I ate the whole thing.   Darn!  My mates had the drunk fried rice, the seafood ginger stinger and the imperial veggie dish.    I tasted them all.   I would definitely order the seafood ginger stinger and the imperial veggie dish when I return.   The server was attentive, efficient and friendly.

Okay, I admit, this is my second review for the M Bar, but it's that good.  I went there for my birthday with some of my favorite gal pals at the M Bar.  Truly, this place knows how to treat a gal and make her feel special.   Executive Chef Michael came out almost as soon as we were seated on the patio and proceeded to make us all feel welcome.   A round of champagne for this group was drunk with pleasure.  Of course, we just had to have a photo taken with Chef Michael.    We ordered off the happy hour menu.   The drinks were superb.   We were hungry, and ordered the mushroom flatbread, grilled prawns, caramelized cauliflower, and the white bean hummus.    Every single item we ordered was lapped up with pleasure.   The sous chef came out to wish me a happy birthday.  Another photo was taken.  Then we were graced with two, count them, two absolutely scrumptious desserts, Dulce de leche bread pudding and, hmmm, sorry; I can't remember the name of the other dessert, commemorating my birthday.     Yes, by that time we were stuffed, but you can bet we enjoyed the dessert immensely and almost licked the plates.   Of course, another photo taken with server Ben who brought the desserts.   Corey, the valet, hearing of our merriment on the patio, must have been wondering what joyous occasion was being celebrated.    Another photo.  Thank goodness the couple sitting next to us, who was visiting AZ from WI, got in on the occasion as well, helping take photos and celebrating my day as well.  Allison was our server.   She was professional and helpful and very sweet.  And even though we were there six hours, they always made us feel welcome.   Would I go again?   Of course!!  Have I been there before?   Of course.  That's why I picked it for my special day.

Went there last night with my daughter for her 21st birthday.  I asked for a window table with a view, which they obliged.  We watched the people romping at the pool as the sun set.  Peaceful and serene, as is the ambiance of the whole resort.  The service was superb with Jose and I can't remember the woman who filled our water glasses and whisked away dirty dishes.  They started us on their complimentary black bean hummus and large crackers.  Sorry.  I can't remember the name of it.  Both were great and we almost filled up on those before the dinner came.  I ordered the fillet mignon and my daughter the new york strip.  Mine was perfect.  It came on a bed of mashed potatoes and steamed spinach.  It was moist and perfectly seasoned.  I am not usually a meat eater, eating a hunk of meat maybe twice a year.  I'm glad this was the hunk that I chose for the year!  My daughter's ny strip was seasoned with something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it was good as well.  Her steak came with finger potatoes and a side of creamed corn.  It was barely creamy, which I didn't try since I'm not a fan of creamed corn.  Her potatoes were good as well, but I'm a fan of mashed potatoes.  It was topped off with their dessert of pretzel bread pudding.  YUMMMMM!!  I was stuffed from the appetizers and dinner, but I took one bite of the dessert and we both finished that as well.  I'd definitely  return.

Met a client/friend there for happy hour.  Sat outside till the sun went down and moved inside.  The ambiance is nothing short of phenomenal, both inside and out.  Our server was Allison.  She knows her trade.   She is extremely friendly and helpful, and knows when we need service and doesn't sweep our dishes away as we have the last bite at our mouth.  She also does not continue returning asking if we needed something nor ignoring us completely and leaving us to ask, "Where the heck is our server??"  There is a large sitting area outside with firepits.  The M Bar is a large, curved bar with plenty of seating both at the bar and around it.  Whoever designed it knew what he/she was doing.  I didn't have a chance to drink their signature cocktails this time, albeit my friend did, and I tasted both.  One sip doesn't help me write a review, nor are they the types of drinks I'd order.  I ordered their happy hour cab and merlot.   Both were good.  I had the grilled prawns and bruschetta.    I thought the prawns were perfect.  They truly were grilled and I wished I had more.  There were two brushetta pieces, one with tomato and the other with small chunks of blue cheese and quinoa and I think some kind of preserve.  I really liked the blue cheese bruschetta.  The tomato one, it was good but didn't particularly stand out.  I can't wait to go there again for the atmosphere, the service, and the food.

Went there for a roller massage, and Natasa was my massage therapist.   It is a combination of hot stones and massage.   Since I had had a hot stone massage in the past, albeit it was a good massage, the therapist spent a lot of time walking back and forth to the hot stone container, and I thought it was a waste of time since it was taking away from my session and I was paying her to do that.   This time, Natasa had the hot stone pot within reach, and no walking back and forth to get stones.   She applied the right amount of pressure and the use of the stones combined with the massage was oh, so relaxing.   It was so relaxing, I caught myself falling asleep a few times.   Too relaxed or too tired?   Don't know.   All I know is I was sorry to have my session end.   Patrons are able to use the rest of the spa facilities while there, which consists of a gym, hot tub, steam room, both wet and dry, showers, etc.   I relaxed a bit after my massage with a cup of tea and a magazine.    I could not linger too long since it was a work day.   I would LOVE to return.   Perhaps Natasa will still be there.

This is definitely THE place to have a romantic happy hour with that favorite person.  Sit on the patio next to the fire, enjoy the ambiance of the views of Camelback Mountain and the food and drink on the happy hour menu.  The servers are efficient, friendly and personable without being intrusive.

Took my client there after we celebrated her selling her house.  We shared the pan seared scallop appetizer; she had the mahi mahi special and I had the prawn linguine.    The scallops were good, nice and plump and not over-cooked and seasoned just perfect.  She said her mahi mahi was delish.   Cooked to perfection.   I don't know what it came with, but she gobbled up the whole thing.   No, sorry, I didn't taste it.   She offered, but I don't know why I declined.   My linguine was el perfecto!!   It had a distinct garlic taste, that is for sure.    Good thing I didn't have any appointments that afternoon.   I love garlic, and the linguine was cooked and flavored just the way I like.   If it isn't anything worse is over-cooked pasta.   UGHH!!   When it says 'prawns,' it means 'prawns.'   Very large shrimp, quite a number of them, also flavored to perfection.   We each had a glass of wine.   Yes, I know, it's happy hour somewhere.   Since we were celebrating her house selling, and her moving on to the next phase of her life, hey, why not.  It was a major step and decision for her.  Should have had a couple!   I will definitely go back.   I had been there quite sometime ago with a former BF, and for some reason, I was not mesmerized with that visit.   Maybe it's cause of the person I was with.   Dunno.

My coolest gal pals and I celebrated my birthday at Frank & Albert's at the Arizona Biltmore Resort.  We went during happy hour to take advantage of their lower pricing.  Unbelievable time all of us had!!  There was enough of us in attendance that we were able to try everything on the HH menu.  The food, the drinks, the service was beyond belief.  It truly lives up to the name and reputation of The Arizona Biltmore.  Of course, we shall go again and again.

I had an opener that has been acting up for quite a few months, and it got to the point of too irritating to deal with anymore.   So I checked with some of my colleagues as to which company they'd recommend.   A colleague whose opinion I trust recommended Franklin Evans.   I called and made an appointment.   He came out when he said he would, took the time to remove my old opener and install a new one.   I picked the belt- operated model versus the chain since there is a longer warranty, longer use period, and quieter.   I LOVE my new opener.    It is definitely quieter.    He explained how it all works, cleaned up his mess and left.   Would I recommend Franklin to my clients?  ABSOLUTELY!!   His website is: http://greengarageaz.com/ and it appears he works valley wide.

I had one of those wondrous discounts via Deal Chicken.    Good thing I did.   With a $100 value, didn't get much.  My daughter was still hungry and I was mildly  "full."    I loved what we ordered, but my daughter did not cause she wasn't used to "authentic" Japanese dishes.   Sorry, hun.   I'm third generation Japanese American,  she's fourth.   She LOVED the tuna sashimi; therefore, ordered two dishes of it.   I ordered the octopus, which was cooked to perfection.    One would expect, with the owner's reputation, he would not overcook it; therefore, making it tough and chewy.   I ordered the soft shell crab.    I liked it.   Cooked to perfection with just the right seasoning.   She wasn't used to seeing shrimp with heads.   Another, sorry, hun, that you were "grossed" out.    I ordered the crab salad.    It was good, and, thankfully, she liked it as well.    Would I go back?    I don't think so.    Not at that price and for what we got, but I can't argue that what we got was good.

I am writing an update cause I had the opportunity of sitting on the porch of the restaurant the other night with a companion  cause it was pouring down buckets.    It happened to be First Friday.   We had ridden the light rail downtown to the AZ Science Center and thought we'd walk around to see what, if anything, exciting was going on.   The owner's, Nobuo, wife served us.   I ordered wine and I don't remember what my companion ordered.   Either a beer or wine.    I didn't pay attention.   I believe Nobuo's wife's name is Sarah.   My companion mentioned to her that he had met the owner prior, whereupon Nobuo came out to say "hi," and we had a short chat.    Both are such friendly and charming people.  Very, very gracious and not the typical "full of himself" type of person that I've experienced with other restaurateurs around the valley who are world renowned.

Went here to celebrate my birthday with some of my hot babe friends, which happened to be cinco de mayo.  Rachel was our bartender/server.  She is very friendly and helpful.  We asked for her recommendations as to what was popular and good.  There was seven of us so we had an opportunity to try quite a few items on the menu.   We ordered the fried sausage ravioli, the coconut chicken tenders, the chicken lettuce wraps, tempura vegetable medley, and the chef's sliders, all from the appetizer menu.  We also tried the mac 'n cheese with bacon and the pork chop dinner.  She makes a great French martini.  I must admit I didn't like the margarita.  I guess it's cause I don't like it with ice, and I like more salt on the rim, but probably my fault since I didn't tell her I didn't want it on ice.  Everything was fabulous, but if you're going to order anything, absolutely a must is the mac 'n cheese with the bacon.  The bacon really adds to it.  And the pork dinner had the right amount of "gravy."  I don't know if I could even call it gravy, but we were practically licking the plates of the mac 'n cheese and the pork.  I really liked the ravioli and the sliders.  Since I'm not all that big on fried food, all I can say is that they were good for fried food, but it wouldn't be something I, personally, would order.  But that's me.  Just like I wouldn't order lamb, but we won't go there.  I'd absolutely return.  reBAR is across the patio, and is the bar.  We dropped in there to see what it looked like.

I have been to this restaurant quite a number of times for various and sundry reasons since it is in a convenient location.    The service and food has been spotty (to say the least!!!) in the past, and I know a new manager and chef was brought on board a few months ago.   I met a client there for drinks, and we ended up having dinner.    I had the Five-Spiced Short Ribs and he had the Cuban Reuben.   The side we ordered on his reuben was the sweet potato fries, since I LOVE sweet potato fries.  Yumm!!   To say my short ribs was delicious is an absolute understatement.    Is there hope for this place??   With this dish I would say 'YES!"   The meat was melt in one's mouth.   The sauce was what I would consider lickable.   I actually ordered some extra of the sauce and left it on the table and had to go back.   No way was I eating the meat without it!   (Oh, yeah.   Forgot to mention that I took part of my meat home.)   The dish was topped with spinach -- I am assumed steamed and lightly seasoned -- and maybe polenta??   It was sort of a cornmeal dish.   I would have preferred mashed potatoes, but the polenta -- if that's what it is -- was good.   Perfecto accompaniments.   He said his reuben was good.   It was quite thick as far as the bread and meat.   I am not a sandwich eater, and I was enjoying the fries and my meat too much to even care to sample it.   Unfortunately, the dishes, when brought to the table, the fries were cold and so was my meat, signaling to me it had been prepared and not immediately served.   What a shame.   You know that sweet potato fries are ONLY good when eaten right out of the fryer.   And, as I stated, my meat was cold as well.   Service is still a bit on the slow side.   There is hope for the restaurant if they can get it together.   My dish was really tasty.   Let's hope the service will improve.

Went there for lunch with a gal pal.  We both ordered the salad with salmon.   I don't know the exact name of the dish since I don't see it on their online menu.   Presentation was very good.   The salmon came on the side of the salad plate with the greens being presented in sort of a glass enclosure that was removed once the dishes were served.  The dressing was light, not heavy and not too much nor overpowering as far as flavoring and amount.  The salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection.   Not dry -- which I hate and makes me dislike fish.   Very moist and flavorful. Perfecto!  Alexandra was our server.   Very pleasant and efficient.   The dish makes for a light lunch as long as one isn't too hungry.   I must admit, I came away a bit hungry, and that could have been because there really wasn't any sort of starch to fill one's tummy.   I would return and try some of the other dishes.   Perhaps dinner or something else on the menu for lunch.

I would have given this five stars if I like beef short ribs.    Since I'm not THAT carnivorous, I will give it four stars.   Sorry to those of you who like that much beef.   Went there last night with a friend.    We ordered the mozzarella pesto as our appetizer, and his main course was the short rib and mine was the chicken penne pasta.    The appetizer had quite an interesting presentation.   The server did quite a show of stretching the cheese and, then, presenting it in a designed manner.   It came with tomatoes, which seasoning was exquisite,  and pesto and some type of dry toast/cracker.    Seriously, we had been at the adjoining Salt Lounge for happy hour, and even though I thought I was starving, by the time we finished the appetizer, I was FULL!   The mozzarella, put atop the cracker, with the pesto and the prosciutto  and the seasoned tomatoes, I would kill for that recipe.   I make a darn good pesto -- if I say so myself -- but theirs was fabulous.   And the flavoring of the tomatoes, I wish I had the ingredients.    I would definitely make them myself.    Getting to the dinner, I LOVED my pasta.   The ingredients in it were the right mix.   I've had plenty of pasta with chicken, but this dish had the right mix of veggies, olives, seasoning, chicken, dunno.    Perfect with a capital P.   His short ribs, he loved.   Me, uhmmm, I'm not that much of a beef eater; I thought it was good, but considering the fact he loved it, I'm thinking it was good.      Would I go back?   You betcha!

Went there today with my four-year-old granddaughter, step granddaughter and daughter-in-law for lunch after having gone to the circus.  I had the beef short rib stew; she had the pork carnitas; the girls had the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich with added bacon from the children's menu.    I tried the grilled cheese sandwich with the bacon.    Yes, it was good.    I didn't try the mac and cheese.   I tried the pork, and that was good.   What I had was delish.   It had enough chili in it to make it a little spicy, which I like.    I think without it, it would have been rather bland.   It came with cornbread, and yes, quite tasty as well.   The restaurant is part of the Fox family of restaurants.   Therefore, would it be anything other than good.   Every one of their restaurants I've tried is good.    Would I go there again?    Yes.    I don't know if there are any other locations besides the one downtown, but I'd go.

Went there a couple of times with my gal pals.    The first time was to celebrate a birthday; the next evening with an additional friend and two friends from the prior evening just to hang out and listen to the music, which was provided by a trio that plays every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.   We were able to make reservations during happy hour, which is unusual.     We had the various HH drinks, which my gal pals seemed to like.    We ordered the lobster tacos, calamari salad, oysters on the half shell, spicy tuna roll sushi.   The lobster tacos were yummy!   Not the "street" taco size but regular.   The sushi was a-okay.   I mean, spicy tuna means they put a bit of fish in with whatever restaurants mix it with.    Me, I like my sushi where it is just the fish and not mixed with anything. That's the way I grew up.   The calamari was good.  I was expecting more, but it came with a salad mix.  That's when I found out it was a salad.   Would I go back?   That's a big definite YES.    The first time our server was Alex, short for Alexandria.   The second evening it was Michael.   Jody was the hostess who helped me make the reservations.  All very accommodating, pleasant, personable and professional.    Oh, yes, I forgot to mention we had to rearrange the dining room cause I had originally made reservations for four but added two.   The staff was very accommodating in this as well.  I would classify it as one of my new favorite places for happy hour.

Went there last night with my guy pal.  Having never eaten Cambodian food,  I felt some degree of trepidation but thought, "What the hey.  Why not?!"  We ordered two dishes to share.  Unfortunately, since the menu items on their website aren't posted, I have no idea what the food dish names are, but the one dish was beef and the other was chicken.  The beef dish was served on a bed of veggies.  Both were quite good and were seasoned to perfection.   We tried the tapioca dessert.  I was stuffed so barely did a taste test.  It was okay; I'm not a big fan of tapioca, but he liked it.  It is a family run operation.  Mom and Auntie cook and son and cousin serve in the dining hall.  We talked to son, Yut.  He told us the history of starting the restaurant. My suggestion for them is get better signage.   Unless one has one's eyes peeled, it is hard to see.   I'd definitely go there again.

I went there last night with some of my gal pals.  I had been there a few weeks ago with a guy and thought it wasn't bad.  Alas, this time out, not the same.  Two of the women I was with said the server was rude.  I thought, hmmm, not possible cause when I was there prior, the server seemed nice.  Well, unfortunately, they were right.  She seemed in a hurry and we had to practically chase her down for service.   When she came, she acted rushed and each time rushed off before the words were completely out of our mouths.    The appetizers we ordered off the happy hour menu were mediocre at best.  So sad that it was a complete disappointment to all of us.  I was hoping for better. ...

I went to this salon on a Groupon for a cut, style, and color.    I was assigned to Genesis.   I thought, "Hmmmm.     I hope I get a good cut and color."    I'm telling you right now, Genesis is my new go-to gal for a cut and color!!   She is young, I think barely getting started in the biz, but she's got a natural talent.    My color is perfect.    I showed her a photo of my cut that I wanted, and usually the style looks good on me when I walk out of the shop and it's downhill from there.  Two weeks later and my style still looks good.    I think people notice the difference as well.   They say they like it; that it looks good.   Normally I don't event get a reaction that I got a haircut.   I hope Genesis let's her customers know if she ever changes shops.    I'll definitely be a follower.

Went there the other day for dinner and I had the Strozzapreti.    Yummmmers!!   It is pasta with grilled chicken, and pine nuts, spinach, mushrooms, and parmesan .   The chicken was grilled to perfection.    I like the flavor of pine nuts, and it could definitely be tasted.   It had the right amount of coloring with the spinach and since I like a creamy Italian dish versus the tomato, the cheese added the right flavoring.   My partner had the chicken parmesan.   As mentioned, I'm not into tomato sauce except on rare occasions.   I thought it ho hum.   It was what I considered typical chicken parmesan.    Nothing I'd order.   I think it came with pasta.   Sorry.    I don't remember.    I just remember what I had and that I loved it!    We also had the calamari for appetizers.   It was nestled in a bed of arugula -- How do you like that word, "nestled?" -- and had a light lemon vinegarette sauce.   Not greasy, and since we like arugula, thought the combination was a good.   We made reservations and waited a tiny bit for our table.   I'd go back, that's for sure.

I have a flat roof, therefore, no attic space.  I heard activity in my master bathroom around the vents; it worked it's way around to the front of the house and decided it liked it there best.    I had recommended this company to a neighbor of mine, who was completely satisfied with them.   I would have used them initially as well except the cost he told me they ended up spending was around $650!!   WHOA!!   And double WHOA!!   That included, I understand, trapping, smoking ($250), eradicating, repairing the drywall that had to be cut and painting.   So I went with another company initially.  That company set bait stations, which to me meant the animal could eat the poison and go somewhere to die.    UGHHH!! if that "somewhere to die" location happened to be in my ceiling area.   (Remember the flat roof??)   I had a problem a few years ago where a couple of dead rats fell down my dryer vent.   I covered all of the vents on my roof -- except one that was hard to get the hood off; therefore, I didn't cover it.   Fast forward a couple of years and I hear the activity mentioned above.   I did the bait stations a few days and decided it was for the birds and I bit the bullet and called CritterTech.   Jason, one of the owners came out.  Looked at my vents.   Set a few traps around the vents at no cost.   He told me I could check the traps myself and reset them or the company could do it, which I gather they only come out once or twice a week.   Maybe once?   I figured I was going to check them once or twice a day so I'd do it myself.   I did that for a couple of weeks and I could still hear something.   I called and had them do the smoke test.  Scott, the co-owner, and his sidekick came out.   Luckily, there were no breaches so it was a matter of resetting the traps and being patient.   I was patient and my patience paid off.   I hear nothing now -- knock on wood big time!!! -- so I covered the one remaining uncovered vent and hope never to have that problem again.   And, yes, I caught a total of five or six rats, but who's counting.   Being a Realtor, I am called on to refer vendors.   Will I be recommending CritterTech again?    You betcha.   In fact, I had referred them to check on a house I had listed where I could hear activity in the ceiling.

Went there for lunch with a client/friend.  We both had the roasted chicken with cavatelli pasta.  Upon first bite, I could taste goat cheese.   YIKES!!   I know I had scanned the description of the menu item.  I hadn't seen anything about goat cheese.   I was thinking about sending it back cause I CAN'T stand goat cheese!!   I gingerly took a few more bites.   I didn't taste it anymore, thank goodness.  It had a tiny bit of shredded roasted chicken.  Tasted like the roast chicken we pick up in the local grocery store.   The dish had a somewhat creamy sauce.  I don't know.   I didn't find anything about it that was especially exciting, but to top it off, afterwards I had stomach cramps, something I get when I eat food that has bacteria.  Was the chicken left out too long?  Was something old in the dish?   Would I go back?   I very strongly doubt it.

Went there with one of the tradespeople I used, using my Passport dining card.    I had the smoked salmon cobb salad, and she had the drunk bread.   The server, Anthony, old me the buttermilk dressing it came with has goat cheese in it.    UGHH!   Do NOT get me anywhere near goat cheese.    He suggested substituting their lemon vinaigrette, and it was perfecto!   The salad has the right combination of bacon, avocado, tomato, egg, with a decorative display of salmon.   Of course, it included lettuce.    I loved it!   Her drunk bread did look good, albeit I didn't taste it.    As I remember, it had cheese and mushrooms, and I don't remember what else, and sat atop a large piece of bread.    If I liked bread, I probably would order it.   She really liked it.   Our server was very helpful and efficient and gave us professional service.  I would definitely return.    I see they have happy hour.   I would need to check out their HH specials.

Went there last evening with a friend.    I looked over the menu, thought, hmmm, they have chicken curry.    Interesting.    This isn't a Thai restaurant, is it, I thought?   Well, I happen to like chicken curry so I ordered it.    It was quite good.    I asked for chili peppers on the side since I like hot.    It had big pieces of chicken, potatoes, julienne cut green beans, onions, mushrooms and plenty of sauce that could easily be mopped up with the rice.    Definitely would give any Thai restaurant a run for its money.   He had the grilled cheese sliders.     I don't normally like bread, but I saw it was bathed in plenty of butter or ??.    Anyway, it looked good, so I had a couple of bites.    Plenty of flavor to cover the fact that I don't like bread, and just enough cheese and bacon that I MIGHT consider ordering it.    I had a glass of their merlot.    I can't remember which one it was, but it was at the top of the wine list.   I had had the pretzel bites in the past with the cheese.   That is really good if one likes soft pretzels.    Yummm for sure.     We sat away from the crowd, since happy hour was still going on.    It was a bit noisy, but we could have a conversation without having to say "What??" or shout.   There is seating on the patio with plenty of misters.    I didn't feel like taking a shower so we sat inside.   Anyway, it was cooler since the temp for the day had been 114.   Would I go again?   Probably if I was on a date.    I don't care for the fact we  have to valet park our cars, but it wasn't my problem, and they do make it especially convenient.

Went there last night with my guy pal, armed with a Deal Chicken.  The place was packed and lots of fun energy abounds.  I ordered the salmon roe sushi and salmon roll.  He ordered teriyaki salmon with veggies and white rice.  The teriyaki sauce is good.  I'm glad to report it doesn't taste like that whatever that awful stuff is that comes out of a bottle like another Japanese restaurant I've been to, which happens to be trendy and expensive.    He isn't JA and likes his fish cooked.   Alas, it was cooked on the outside, but not on the inside.  YIKES!   We called over the server, Rachael, and she was most apologetic and asked if he wanted to have the same fish cooked more or a complete new meal.  My guy said, "Whatever is easier."  (He surely didn't want to upset the chef!)  Well, they brought out a complete new dinner.  Nice!  Unfortunately, this time it was a little bit too cooked, which could be that the chef wanted to make sure it was cooked, which my guy appreciated.    Back to my sushi, the salmon roe smelled and tasted a bit too fishy.  Those who know what salmon roe tastes like know what I mean.  Yes, it is fish eggs and it is supposed to be fishy, but it's like fish that is heading towards the end of its edible life.  The salmon roll was good.  I'm not real big on those type of rolls.  Me, I like the seafood plain and plopped on a bite-size bit of rice and wrapped in nori.  That's my way of eating sushi.     To make up for the teriyaki and its uncooked condition, the restaurant was kind enough to give us pears with ice cream and whipped cream, topped with a flavorful sauce.  YUMMMM!!   That was fabulously wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't order a lot to eat!   Getting back to our server, Rachel -- Notice I spelled it two different ways since I don't know how she spells her name? -- she was very professional and friendly   When I go back, I hope she is our server again.  She's extremely gracious.  I would go back.  The next time I go, though, I would try the tuna sushi -- no not the rolls; remember, that's not my favorite way of eating sushi -- try the salmon roe sushi again, and whatever else strikes my fancy.

I went there with my guy pal and I'm only giving this place four stars cause we had the dinner AND dessert.   If it was JUST the dessert, I'd give it more than the maximum five stars.  First the dessert:   I had the Irish crumble and he had the lemon tart.  WOW!!!   The Irish crumble flavor, texture, and aesthetic appeal was nothing short of phenomenal.    It was layered with two different types of chocolate and heavy cream.   Very light and airy and just the right amount.   I don't know what else it is made of, but I'd sure like the recipe.    I wonder if the owner will share it??!!   The lemon tart was fabulously wonderful as well.   Yes, my guy pal let me have a bite, but only a bite.   Lemon desserts are not my favorite desserts, and I count chocolate as one of the major food groups.   So you know which dessert I liked better.  The bakery is adjacent to the restaurant.   So much to choose from.   All of them are a work of art.   And I bet they taste as good as they look.   The perfect place to get that special someone a wonderfully delicious dessert.     As far as dinner, I had the seared jumbo scallops in white wine creamy garlic sauce with fresh veggies, and he had the Budda beer and burger special.  The scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked.   Geeezzzz, I hate it when places overcook the seafood!  Not this place.   El perfecto.  The sauce had the perfect blend of creamy sauce and garlic.   If I had some rice to go along with it, I would have sopped up the sauce with the rice.   Hey, I'm Asian.   What can I say??  His burger was good as well.   I'm not a real hamburger kinda gal.   But it was good as burgers go.  The owner is truly from France.   He is friendly, and makes it a point of going to each table, and talking to his guests.   He wrote his name and number down, but, for the life of me, I can't read his writing.   He told me he is half Japanese and half Chinese.   I found it quite interesting that an Asian speaks with a French accent.    Guess I need to get out more.  I'd definitely go back, especially to try the many other eye-appealing desserts.

Went there with a guy pal during happy hour, and was pleasantly surprised.   We had the salmon and tuna nigiri and spicy tuna roll.   The prices for the nigiri are really reasonably priced.   The fish is fresh and firm, the rice not dried out and hard.  We tried some of the happy hour drinks.   Not to my taste.  Too sweet.   I don't like my drinks that sweet.  The restaurant is tucked into a shopping center, and it was full during the time we were there.   It gets quite a crowd.  Especially for what we get, I would definitely return.   It's a great happy hour nigiri choice.

Went for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the meal was.    As the first course, we ordered the farm salad and the simple salad.    I definitely enjoyed my salad with the creamy dressing and the cheese and other items, although I must admit, for my taste, they could use less of the dressing.   It overpowers the salad.   Next time I will order it on the side.   My mate's salad was more on the plain side with balsamic vinegar, and it was great, but a dressing I could enjoy at home.  For the main course we ordered the flat iron steak with fingerlings and grilled veggies.    Just the right texture and flavoring.    I am sorry I didn't learn what was in the sauce for the flat iron so I could duplicate.    For dessert we ordered the pumpkin budino and red velvet cake.   Oh, my goodness!   I was stuffed, but had to finish what I ordered, which was the pumpkin budino.    My mate absolutely loved the red velvet cake, which comes with ice cream.    Our server was Elijah.    Very personable and efficient.   I would definitely go back.

Soooo mad and disappointed at the service we received last night.    I don't know if they were short help or what.   Maybe so since it appears the parent company has filed for bankruptcy reorganization.   I didn't even see a hostess on duty when I came in, and I didn't really see one as I walked back and forth from the dining room to the bar.   Why was I walking back and forth?   Well, I was there for a party.   I guess the people hosting the party thought they were getting the back room as they had done last year.   Nope.   So they were talking to whomever (I presume the manager), and we stayed where we were.    Oh, well.   No big thing to me.   What was disappointing is the fact our server was busy elsewhere; therefore, I had to go to the bar to get my drink since I wanted it on the happy hour pricing.   Then it was getting close to the witching hour;  still no sight of a server,  so I went looking for someone to see if he could have our server come to our table so we could order.  She came.   Since it was a minute or so around 7:00 (the witching hour of when HH is over), I asked if my order could be had at the HH price.   She said she'd see but didn't know for sure.   As it turned out, it was.   We had to keep flagging someone down to ask the server to come to the table so they could order.   My water glass sat empty for a long time till I finally got it filled after asking two or three times.   Then at the end, when I was paying with my gift cards that I had bought during the restaurant's promotion, she told me I couldn't use it for the tip.    I told her I had used it twice prior and had no problem.   She argued with me about that.   Then she came back with the, I assume, manager, and she told me the same.   WHAT???!!   Then the server wanted to know when did I ask for water and not receive it.   WHAT??!!    Is she calling me a liar???!!!   I have been to this restaurant numerous times in the past, and I do mean numerous.    I do love the shrimp bites they have on the appetizer menu and some of the other items.   I was there less than a couple of weeks ago for another party.   What the heck.   I hope this is not a reflection of what service is going to be like since the BK filing.   What a drastic change in service.

Went there today for lunch.    I had the PAN SEARED SCOTTISH SALMON forbidden rice, shallot vinaigrette, and my companion had the PRIME BEEF BRISKET.   Yummm!   The server asked how I wanted my salmon.   I said I wanted it completely cooked but not over-cooked.   He kept asking me if I wanted it well done or extra well done or whatever.   I DON'T know!    I just want it cooked all the way but not over-cooked.    Yes, I like salmon nigiri if I am having sushi, meaning my salmon will be raw.   Having it seared and raw on the inside, UGHHH!!!  Grosses me out!   Anyway, I digress.  The salmon was cooked and seasoned to perfection.   It wasn't overcooked and was moist.  It was seasoned perfectly.   I don't know what it was seasoned with, but it was a very good combination of spices/herbs.   It sat on a bed of black rice, which had the perfect blend of seasoning as well.   I have no idea why it is called "forbidden rice."   He had the prime beef brisket.   The BBQ sauce was on the side.   I tried the brisket.   It was melt in one's mouth.   Very good and tender.   Served on the side were tortillas, and he ate it like a wrap.   I was not impressed with the BBQ sauce.   I thought that was good but rather ho hum, but, then, what can one do with BBQ sauce -- except ruin it.   It was good.   So that's a plus.   I would go back for the salmon.    I'm not what I would consider a beef eater so perhaps, if there is pork on the menu, I would try that.

I went to The Yard the other night.   To say the place was crowded and loud is an understatement.   There was a band playing and wall to wall people.   We were going to eat at Culinary Dropout, but since the place was so crowded and noisy, we decided to try Little Cleo's.   Somehow, I dunno, we wanted to have a conversation.   I tried the cajun shrimp, and my honey the linguine and mussels with squid ink pasta.   Before I go much further, our server/bartender was Casey.   We sat at the bar since the wait was longer than we wanted for a table.   Of course, we had to wait, anyway, but that's okay.    I didn't mind.  My companion didn't know the name of the drink he wanted; he described it to Casey, and, voila!   Casey came up with not only the name but the drink described.   My companion said it was perfect.   Good to hear.    Casey did mention that the cajun shrimp  was a bit salty.    Yes, it was, but very good, nonetheless.   The flavors were perfect, and the accompanying sides were a good compliment.   Casey described the pasta -- when we inquired since we had no idea what exactly the description meant -- was homemade and had a minute touch of the squid ink, which meant it was what one would consider either a light black or dark gray.    He liked the pasta.    I tried it.  Yes, very tasty.   He tried my shrimp, and agreed it was very good as well.    I was not impressed with the mussels.   They were on the very small side.   The kitchen is right there so no secret about food prep.   The three gentlemen working the kitchen:   head chef, sous and ? were busy.   I don't know the formal names of chefs so that's the best I can come up with.   When Casey wasn't busy with his customers, he's very personable and friendly in talking to the guests.   Would I go back?   I probably would.

Went there with a friend/client last night for dinner.   Luckily, we went rather early so it was still happy hour, which ends at, what?? the early hour of 5:00.  Well, glad we weren't planning on ordering any food at that early hour, but we did order drinks from their HH menu.   I had the lemongrass yuzu mule, which, when I asked our server -- more about him/them later -- if it was similiar to a moscow mule.   He said, "Yes."   I asked if I could have another vodka besides Smirnoff.   He said, "Of course."   My companion had the house reisling or something.   I don't like sweet wine.   When I tasted it, it confirmed my opinion.   I liked my mule.   I asked that the second drink not have quite as much fresh lime, since, to my taste, it made it too tart.   The bartender did cut back on the lime, so the second drink came out el perfecto.   I had the Bouillabaisse  and he had the Traditional Fish & Chips.   I tasted his fish, which was fried.   It had a thin coating of batter, and the fish was plentiful and fresh and flavored just perfect.   I didn't try the fries.   I like sweet potato fries not the other.  Besides, there weren't that many and figured he might want to have them all.   My bouillabaisse was great.   It has shrimp, mussels, small bits of I believe clams? and was in a light tomato base sauce, which was quite tasty with a tiny "kick" to it, which I like.  Our servers were, I think, Shad and Casey.   So cute and efficient, personable, and professional.   Always made a point of giving us perfect service.   This is my second review on the restaurant.   I would definitely return.

Went there recently for a late morning breakfast during the week.   Had to wait a bit for a table, which is no problem.   I had the blueberry danish double pancakes and he had the snooze classic.   My favorite pancake is blueberry.  They were light and fluffy with a light blueberry compote drizzle over the top.   There was a sweet I don't know what on the inside of a portion of one of the pancakes.   I'm not sure what it was, but if a small part of it is eaten with the other parts of the pancakes, it cuts down on the too sweet flavor.   I tried his hash browns and bacon.   Yumm on the hash browns.   The bacon was thick and crisp, just the way I like bacon.   I believe it had sort of a smokey flavor.   I would definitely return.

Went there for dinner.   My companion made no reservation so the hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the bar.   Since the wait would be two hours otherwise, why not?   It wasn't so bad in the bar.   There are TVs in there and one could get sidetracked by the number of different shows if one wanted.  Since we were not interested in what was going on -- the final basketball game between ? and ? with ? winning -- it wasn't a distraction.    He had a salad and I had the braised short ribs.    YUMMM!     I am not usually a meat eater, but this was melt-in-your-mouth good.  It was flavored with a bourbon carmel sauce.    And the side was mashed potatoes.    Another yummm.   Flavored just right.  I don't know what salad he ordered.   Since I am not a salad person as a main course, I paid no attention.   We ordered a bottle of the Rickshaw cab.    Not bad wine.   Full bodied, the way I like red wine.  Would I go again?   Absolutely!

Okay.     Following my review for lunch, I've been here a couple of times for their happy hour cause some friends were raving about it, plus, it's fairly close.   I've had the truffles edamame,  the almond chicken, pork pot stickers, and the orange puff.    You must absolutely try the truffles edamame.   A tasty mixture of spices are added to the truffle oil and the flavors pop in one's mouth.   The sauces for the pot stickers and the almond chicken are on the mark.   The martinis of the day were the mango, which I changed from being made with gin to vodka, since I enjoy vodka more than gin, and I'm glad I changed.   It wasn't too sweet, and had just a hint of ginger.  I don't like my drinks too sweet.   Yummm!!  The martini of the day, the prior day, unfortunately, I can't remember the name.    All I remember is it was pink.   Sorry!   Our HH server/bartender the first time was Chase, and the second time Diana, whose Vietnamese name is My Lien.   Why she goes by "Diana" is beyond me.    She is actually a school teacher, and this is her summer job.   Too bad she can't work there all year.    Diana is especially nice, friendly and helpful.     I asked Johnny if the food is fried in peanut oil, since both of my children are allergic to nuts.     He said no, since a lot of people have a nut intolerance/allergy.   I think he said they used olive oil, but I can't remember.   So that's a good thing, not using the peanut oil for frying.  I would go back.   The only thing that bothers me, is when I am with nonAsian friends, Johnny (the owner) totally ignores me when we are having a conversation.    Should that bother me?    Dunno.     I wasn't the only one who noticed that.    Just saying. ...

I have been here a few times for lunch, and I will say that every time I have been pleased with what I have.   I always go for the sashimi or sushi that does not have all  the whatever mixed in it.   That's what I'm used to and that's what I like.  Pleezzzz!   What is that stuff that is mixed with the fish that people seem to like??!!   Anyway, I have had the assorted sashimi dish, which always has an assortment of different fish, and it's always fresh.   Or I have the sushi combo.  With that dish I eat the sushi, and I give the "California roll" to my companion.  Yes, the restaurant is a bit on the small side; therefore, we go early so we don't have to wait.   Waiting at lunch time equates to eating somewhere else since my lunch companion is on a time clock.   The staff is friendly and professional.

I have now been to The Beverly three times, twice with friends and on a date and once with my gal pals when we celebrated my birthday bash.   The servers are always quite friendly and efficient.   The HH cocktails are great.   I ordered the drink that has the word "aspirin" in it.  I can't remember the exact name.   It was soooo good that three of my four gal pals ordered it as well.  We had the mac and cheese, the wings, deviled eggs, margarita flatbread, truffle fries.   I like the wings, mac and cheese and the fries.   I didn't care for the eggs.   Too much pickle.   I don't especially care for bread, therefore didn't really like the flatbread.     The furniture is rather dark and heavy.   One can sit on the patio in the front as well and watch and listen to the traffic.   I like the atmosphere albeit it could probably seem "hot" in the summer because of the darkness of the decor.    A musician was setting up when we left.   Next time, I shall have to stay for the music.

Went there for lunch today with one of my buds.   I had the la pasta di leonardo and she had the linguine con vongole.    YUMMMM!  is the only word to describe my dish.   It had the perfect amount of seasoning and the pasta was cooked just right.   The chicken was cooked to perfection, and it had just the right blend of pine nuts and roasted bell peppers.   She loved her dish, yes, she did.   I was stuffed to the gills, but she wanted to try the desserts.   We tried the pistachio cheesecake.   That's where the rating falls.    To me it had some kind of what seemed to be a metallic taste.    I couldn't put my finger on it.   And the consistency of the cheesecake was very thick.   We were hoping it was made with ricotta cheese.    Oh, yes, I forgot to mention that the drinking water needed to be run through some sort of purification system.    It had a chemical taste.   So if I hadn't tried the cheesecake, and if the water didn't have a chemical taste, I think my meal was perfecto!

I was first introduced to this restaurant at the annual Devoured event at the Phoenix Art Museum.   If you haven't checked out Devoured, you should.   Lots of restaurants, etc. give a sampling of their food and drinks to introduce prospective customers to their establishment.  I liked what I had at the event so I went there with my friend afterwards. And since I had such an enjoyable experience, I chose it for my birthday bash with my favorite gal pals.    I didn't get around to writing a review for those events, but I will now.   Prior, it was cool enough to sit on the patio.   Not today.   Too hot!   Sat inside with a friend for happy hour.   I won't write about the drinks we had but I will about the food.  We had the CHINESE CHAR SIU RIBS and the KOREAN PORK STEAMED BUNS.   Yummmm!!   I have had the ribs on the two prior occasions.   I think it's my favorite.   The meat just falls right off the bones and the flavoring is perfect.  It's lick-your-fingers good.  I wasn't sure about ordering the steamed buns, but I thought, "What the heck."    WHOA!    Double yummm on those as well.  The bun is soft and fluffy, and the the pork is flavored with a sort of Asian sauce I couldn't quite put my finger on.    I would definitely order that again.   The owner Shawn/Shaun/Sean is a definite hands-on owner.   He is friendly and greets the customers as they come in and talks to them in a very nonintrusive way.   Yes, you can bet I would definitely return.

I am giving this four stars only because of the dessert.    Otherwise, I would give it three.   I went there the other day for lunch with a friend.    I had read about it on Yelp, saw that it had decent reviews, and suggested we go.     I had the fettucchine della casa with chicken and she had the lasagna.      First, my review of her lasagna.    I am NOT a fan of tomato-based sauces, therefore, that is why I don't order those type of dishes.    She LOVED it.     I thought it was okay.    Tasted like lasagna.   My dish, on the other hand, was good.    I wish it had more chicken, since one has to pay extra for it.    Thankfully, it was not boiled.    UGHHH!     I hate the taste and texture of boiled chicken!   It was either fried or roasted, and was good.   The flavors in the pasta were good.    Not fabulous but good.   My friend wanted to try the desserts.   That's how much she loved her lasagna.   She wanted to experience more of the menu.   We ordered the .   WHOA!!!    Yummmm!!     If it would have been polite, I would have licked the plate.    Jaime, the son of Pedro, the owner, told us everything was homemade, including the desserts.    I will believe it.    I would have liked to have ordered it for my complete lunch or, at least, taken some home, but I could not imagine how many calories it has.     Since we were the only customers in the restaurant, Jaime was able to talk to us.    Father was clearly visible, but didn't come over to say "hi."    Must be shy.    Jaime said the restaurant had only been open three months, and was very busy for the dinner hour.    They are going to have music later.    There are murals on the wall, and he said they were going to have more.    Hopefully, not too much, or the walls will look too busy.     I would definitely like to order the tiramisu to go.    I wonder if I can order a whole cake??    Hmmm

Went there for lunch with a colleague the day after opening.  It was a late lunch, and there were plenty of servers around, including the manager.   I can't give a review on the food since I didn't eat.  There was plenty of wait staff, and a lot of them came by.   Went back a couple of days later for happy hour.   It was a Friday.  Whoa!!   Chaos!   Plenty of servers, again.  We grabbed a table in the bar, got the appetizer menu (Food is not part of happy hour specials), and were told by four different people what was on the happy hour drink menu.   Since the information didn't coincide with what we were told at lunch, I talked to the manager.   He had to go to the bar  staff to get what was on the bar happy hour.   We ordered the mussels, which my companion had had in another Bonefish location.   They were mussels.   Nothing special.   The tables for two were taken by the time we got there; therefore, we sat at a table for four.   People kept stopping by our table and asking if they could join us.   Uhhhhh, hello??!!   No!!!   He was so irritated by all of the different responses of what or was not on the happy hour food menu and the fact that people kept wanting to sit with us that we ended up going to another restaurant for dinner.   Well, six days later I went there with another friend cause I thought it would be good and since it was not a Friday, I figured it would not be as busy.   I had the basil fettuccine, and he had the lobster grilled cheese.  I tried his lobster grilled cheese sandwich.   Meh.   He loved the lobster bisque that came with it .   I didn't try it cause he had a cold.   He said the salad was good that it came with as well.    My fettuccine, meh.  So so.   It had a lot of artichoke hearts in it that I didn't especially care for its flavor.   I love pasta, but this fettuccine left a lot to be desired in its flavoring.  I ordered it with chicken added.   Another meh.   I don't know.   Would I go back?  Probably not.   There's a lot of restaurants in town, good ones to boot.  Not worth it to go to a mediocre restaurant.   If I did go, perhaps would try one of their fish dishes.

Went there with a couple of friends for happy hour.   I can't find their menu on the 'net so I'll have to describe what I had versus the actual name.   We had the dilly beans, which we agreed was interesting but we barely ate it.   Since none of us is from the south, maybe it's not something we're used to.   String beans which tasted a lot of dill and deep fried was most interesting but to us not palatable.  We had the smoked chicken wings, which we agreed was quite smoky, but otherwise was not too tasty.  Left some of that on the serving platter as well.   Quite frankly, it could be it is not our collective tastes in food, but I know I, for one in our group, would not return.   The server was very efficient and friendly, and we liked her.   Very friendly bartender and helpful as well.

I must admit, I was expecting a lot since it is owned by LGO.   Went there last night after a show.   Since it was after 10:00 p.m., I asked about the reverse happy hour.   I was told only drinks are on reverse happy hour.   Okay.   My companion ordered the Aunt Charlie and I guess it's an okay drink if one likes sweet drinks.   We ordered the scallop entree ($26) and the troife pasta ($23.)   There were three large scallops surrounded by a sauce and sauted veggies on the side.   The scallops dipped in the sauce was mehhh okay.   The veggies were seasoned with an overpowering array of seasoning.  The troife pasta had what appeared to be pieces of shrimp, not the whole shrimp.  Few small pieces of sausage and some kale and sundried tomatoes.   I have no idea what kind of pasta it was.   It looked like small broken pieces of thin spaghetti.  That dish was nondescript as well.   In fact, I thought the seasoning was a bit bland.   I tried it by putting some of the veggies from my companion's dish on it.  It didn't help at all.   Both dishes were not very big.   I don't eat that much, but if I was a bigger person, I don't think I would have been full.   Would I go back?    I doubt it.   There are much better restaurants out there.  And I feel the food is outrageously expensive for what one gets.

Went there with some of my gal pals for brunch.   I am not familiar with "southern" food except to have the belief it's greasy and basically unhealthy.   Well, not true!    My gal pals had the fried green tomato benedict and croque monsieur.  They added eggs.  We shared beignets as well.    I had the camelback salad.   The display of the salad was enticing.   Every item was separated and not just thrown within.   I asked that it not be drowned in dressing, whereupon our excellent server, Jordan, informed me it is lightly tossed.   And it was.  The green tomato benedict was good.    The idea of a fried green tomato did not appeal to me initially.    I must admit, it didn't even taste like a tomato.   It was lightly fried and seasoned.  The bread of the croque monsieur was tasty albeit I am not fond of bread.   The beignets were good although I didn't have anything to compare them to having never eaten it prior.  Not something I'd order, though.  Bread with powdered sugar?   Nahhh!   Not my type of food.   One of my friends ordered the breakfast bloody mary.    She pronounced it quite good.    One of the other friends tried it and agreed.   Jordan, our server, was great.   Most helpful with his advice and very professional.   Even though I had trepidation about going there, I'd go again.
