I'll be honest, this wasn't our first, second or even third option for breakfast, but when it came to early Sunday grubbing with a group of six, this was pretty much the only place didn't have a two-day long wait.   In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet.   The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure.   One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.  I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two).   Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment.   PS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.

If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh.   What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.  If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after.   No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.  I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.  We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.  On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with.   Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are.

I didn't bring a black light or anything, but from the naked eye's point of view, this place is totally legit and a whole heck of a lot cleaner and nicer than most of the hotel's I've stayed at in recent times on my own, non-business-trip budget.   I stayed over the weekend in one of their double-queen rooms with 3 other people and were able to get the government rate of $120 a night thanks to a friend of mine having a fairly reputable job with perks that knocked around $80 off the standard rate for the hotel without the government discount. The room was spacious with plenty of room for the four of us, no crusty stains and pretty clean smell. The bathroom was large with a single sink outside the room so one person could get ready while another showered (or puked their pants off in my case). The room could have used more mirrors to make it a little easier for me and the other girl to get ready without rubbing our butts together at the sink area, but I guess it was fine since I came down with some form of the plague over the weekend and no amount of primping was going to make me look like a respectable human anyway.    The area the hotel is in seemed like a pretty central one for happening things and not too terribly far from ish, but their $20 nightly parking fee adds up. We're cheap so we opted to save our wallets from being raped of any Andrew Jackson's and parked at the meters surrounding the Marriott that run from 9-6pm each day. Just remember to set your alarm so you can have your quarters in the meter before the clock strikes 9am EST or you'll end up forking over $20 for a parking violation anyway, and the hipster meter maid man in this area was noticeably diligent. On Sundays the parking on Aiken right across from the Marriott and in front of that church is free, so we made it a point to snag a spot there so we could sleep in on our last day of Pittsburgh-ing.   They have an indoor pool, free coffee and computers usage in the lobby, free wi-fi throughout the whole hotel and conference rooms should you need that sort of thing for work as well. I had checked out a few hotels and rates before we went and for what we got and how almost-stain-free** the place was, this Marriott seemed world's better than the rest of the lot in our affordability price range   ** I (accidentally) left my signature Candice calling card, an orange-stained pillowcase. Sorry, Housekeeping! A little bit of bleach and that sh*t should come right out.

The Saturday before Halloween is apparently not something the good folks of Madison, Wisconsin take lightly. #Freakfest  I found myself in town visiting friends who live in the Madison-metro area and make it a point to celebrate the State street festivities every year. They live about 5 or so miles from the actual fest and because drinking and driving is never in style, they'd gone ahead and arranged a day in advance for 2 cabs to come pick our group of 7 up at their place of residence at 8:45pm.   Now, this was my virgin visit to Madison at Halloween time so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, though I can't say I wasn't warned. I knew streets would be closed down and blocked off and this wouldn't be your typical Madison experience, but without seeing the Mad city madness first-hand, it was hard to anticipate just what we were up against when it came to our group versus on-time transportation on this hallowed eve.   Union Cab did miss the mark as far as sending the two cabs that we'd ordered more than a day in advance to arrive at 8:45pm. The first cab arrived at 9pm to pick up the first half of our group off at the fest, but when the first group arrived at said bar and realized that the second group had still not been picked up, they asked if that cab could go back and get us, ya know, since there was supposed to have been another cab there 30 minutes earlier anyway. But the driver said they were unable to locate the second cab and that it was against the rules to come back and pick up the second group who were still waiting since they were not the assigned cab. Makes very little sense, but at the same time is sort of understandable on such a crazy eve, but the reservation should've counted for something.   When we (the second group still at the house) tried calling Union, all we got were busy signals being that it's one of Madison's busiest cab nights of the year. So naturally, we did the only thing we could... crack open another beer and wait and chug and wait and chug and wait. It was just before 10pm when our cab finally arrived. The driver was super fun, quirky and costumed for the holiday and quickly made us forget about how Union had failed to provide us with transportation until over an hour after the previously scheduled and agreed upon time.  Also worth noting, because it won Union back a lot of stars that would otherwise have been missing given the tardiness, is how immaculate the shiny, gleaming Toyota Prius cab was. It smelled divine, and not overpowering or like it had something to cover up. And -get this- it had cloth seats. CLOTH SEATS. It didn't smell like sh*t. ZERO crumbs. Sans stains. Not even a whiff of urine or vomit. Where the hell was I? Bizarro World, surely.   So, while I don't know that I'd trust Union as my chariot on a big day where I needed to be somewhere in a timely manner (ala the airport), they were plenty fine for a casual booze-bender and the amenities (no puke stains or pee smells) made the ride a pretty enjoyable one.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport: The portrait of inefficiency.   Phoenix is a legit city. It's bustling and friendly and there's no shortage of reasons to come visit, in fact I can only think of one thing that would keep me away and that's having to snail walk through security check-points with not nearly enough security personnel and an incredibly outdated system.   I've never been in a slower line anywhere. Their machine takes forever to reset in between people, the security agents bicker with each other or general airport rules, and they have no idea how efficiently use their staff and equipment for the betterment of everyone's experience and manner.   Beyond the total failure to be able to process what was actually a pretty short line of people through to their gates, the food and beverage options are abysmal at best.

Bewbz, Boobies & Tittays.  Now this. THIS is art I can get down with.   On a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper.   Now, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch.   What I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song.   Another exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t.   The exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room.   The doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over.   The room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.  The mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in.   There's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it.   If you're in Pittsburgh, defo pencil in the Mattress Factory for a 2-hour art excursion.

Canoe rental, small but sandy beach, fine fishing set up and great place to spot co-eds sunbathing!  I know that last bit made me sound extra perv-y, but it's true and, I figured, worth a mention.   This humble park, rest area, playground, picnic site and more was the perfect after farmer's market madness respite and a cute place to day-date with your boo, and it's totally free to enjoy, unlike a lot of the somewhat comparable(ish) Chi-Suburban beaches and Indy shoreline beaches and I LOVED that for an extremely nominal fee you can rent a bicycle and ride up and down the lakefront.   I don't know that I'd eat any fish out of here, but we did see a number of people (mostly couples) fishing off the lakefront walk and there were people who had set up grills to cook up some grub as well. Everyone here less maybe one old 'girl-watcher' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raJWuz7qQVc) seemed to be young and fresh off campus, looking to fill the day with a fun, fresh-air, outdoor activity.   Not gonna lie, I love where I live, but I wish there was something out by me. I know Chicago and the 'burbs have a number of beach fronts, but on a nice day, the last place you want to be is the crazy-crowded beach with polished glass shard sand. James Madison Park, though tiny and not comparable to a Lake Michigan gathering area in any size-able terms, seemed to be exactly what the Ills is missing.

Radish, rhubarb, cheese curd. Radish, rhubard, cheese curd. Radish, rhubarb, cheese curd.  I think it was a mixture of my having been to very few farmer' markets + reading all the reviews and likening it to adult Disneyland, that made for my being disappointed in the Dane County Farmer's Market.   I guess I should just be happy that it was a nice day even though the weather forecast called for rain. But with that sunshine came droves of slow walking, stroller pushing stop in the midst of a moving crown and gawk while shoving food in your mouth crowds.   The scene was lovely and the square held such potential for what businesses and goods I'd find inside, but really, I found a lot of the same ish at 85% of the tables. We did get some cheese curds from a place a Wisco lad said was the absolute best (but I'd had better when a friend brought back the dill curds from another vendor at the very same fair), but other than that, it was really just a fair for plants and people selling radishes and rhubarb. How many things can you make out of radish and rhubarb as the main ingredient? Is this a Wisco thing? Because I don't think we Illini have put much stock in the dietary nourishment of radishes and rhubarb as a main ingredient.  I guess after having been to farmers market out in the SoCal area, it's probably hard to compare, but is this one really all that much superior to other farmer's markets? Maybe I went on an off day but I just wasn't as excited as I expected to be. I'll go again, but I'll have more level expectations this time, for sure.

As an out-of-towner I have to give props the Monononononongahela for being a viable form of public transportation in a city that seems to be struggling a bit in that sense, but as for being something super amazing for tourists to see, I wasn't terribly impressed.  At $3.50 for a round-trip ticket, it'll by no means break your budget, but I don't know that it was necessarily worth the headache of trying to buy a ticket at the top with one attendant on duty and what appeared to be a line full of people who had never seen a touch screen device before.   The view was pretty cool but the realization that the incline isn't a ride and is a form of public transit is sobering.

My experience at East End was a pretty lame one, though to no fault of the brewery. I was the kind of sick that typically involves a deathbed and a Cholera diagnosis, so while everyone else drank deliciously hand-crafted brew, I crouched against the brick wall, in a dark corner of the brewery behind a bucket of coasters and naked Christmas tree, clinging to a sample of their Ginger-ale. Pretty sure it was the plague, because anything less and you know I'd have been all up on those taps.   So basically, this is going to be the lamest review of a brewery in the history of history, as I had only two sips of beer and then promptly went back to hunching over in my dark, concrete corner with a sample glass of ginger-y goodness, because OF COURSE I would get super sick for the first time in years on the day of our fateful road trip to Pittsburgh, that was taken with the purpose of spending time with old friends and drinking lots (LOTS!!!) of beer. Of.F*cking.Course.  Aaanyway, blah, blah, blah, my single sips of their winter white and Nunkin (no pumpkin) seasonals were dreamy and didn't make me barf at all--not one little bit. But the real star, and I know you guys are going to laugh, is that freakin' ginger-ale. OhMahGah it's so good! Seriously, just smell it. It's the most potent ginger scent outside of eating a bushel's worth of ginger root and puking it up so hard it comes out your nose. What? No. I mean, that's totally never happened to me... not with ginger at least (saganaki is a different story). But back to that ginger-ale: it's unreal. And luckily, exactly what I needed to fend off the urge to purge from my mystery illness (please not morning sickness. please not morning sickness. please not morning sickness.).    And while I loved my ginger-y ale and did end up leaving with a growler of it, the process to get said growler and aforementioned samples was pretty f*cking annoying and made even worse that there's not a single place to sit so because I couldn't bring my sick, sad self to even stand up straight I had to keep myself from yakking all over their merch by squatting in a dark, cave-like area as if I were some 21st century Smeagol. There was only one man working at 4pm on a Friday and a ridiculously long line wrapping around the register, merch and tasting area. The lone worker was filling growlers, answering questions, checking IDs, explaining crazy-ass Amish liquor laws, providing a sample of everything to everyone and running the register, which consisted of an iPad, and I'm not sure how familiar you are with businesses who use iPads as registers, but it's slow as f*ck, they have to type in every number and is a great way to really hold up an already mile-long line.... Ain't nobody got time for that! It's Friday f*cking night, scrape up a second employee and get the show on the road.

Friendliest F-ers (FedEx-ers) I've ever encountered!   Well staffed with employees who actually want to help you and aren't there to try and gouge you in upgrades and weights and ish.   Maybe that's just how Wisconsin folk are, though. I got something printed at this location for $2.50 that according to the Illini F-ers, was going to cost me AT LEAST $39.99... whatta buncha crooked copiers.

Me: Is that half a dead rat sewn to half a dead pigeon? Mr Arm: Yes.  Me: Oh. Then what's in the jar next to rat-bird? Mr Arm: That's 3/4 of a dead dove sewn to 1/4 of a deceased shark and that over there is a German Shepard penis. Me: Neat-O.   Mr Arm: Can you guess what's in that jar? Me: A cat sewn to a bat?  Mr Arm: You're half right. Me: A bat-bird?  Mr Arm: Getting colder... Me: bat-bunny? Mr Arm: Colder Me: **squinting eyes to decipher the remains floating in the jar of embalming booze** Mr Arm: It's a cat. Just a cat. No hybrid here, the hair's just gone. Me: I see.    **These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**  First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by.   All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM.   The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor.   Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some.  - Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox - An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod - A cat on a hat - Legos - Colon photos - 100+ year old stuffed fox - Old electro-shock machine - Jar of human teeth - Jar of human skin flakes - Jar of human finger and toe nails - Tentacles - A family of amphibians - A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five - Steampunk bears - Bindle stick bundles - A gerbil named 'poop' - Ray guns - Gimp-type masks - Original Addams family goodies - Carnival treasures - Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse - I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats - And soooo much more...  When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.

To whom it may concern: They do not serve sugar-free red bull.  And while the above statement doesn't affect me in any capacity. I took great pleasure in hearing it repeated over and over and over again by the bartenders of Roast, as they hurriedly worked to serve alcoholic beverages (and one hell of a fry basket) to bar full of patrons while surrounded by walls covered in a masterfully compiled craft beer list... for a college bar, that is.   It was in this moment that I finally came to appreciate the phrase, 'with age comes wisdom'. I was older than everyone in this bar and for one of the first times in recent years, I was okay with being the grandma of the bar scene as I sipped my tastefully brewed draft beer amongst the stacks of Bud light left on the tables and otherwise tasteful and trendy decor.  Now, I told myself I wasn't going to review any of the bars I went to during Freakfest, but Roast managed to avoid the holiday hell and promote themselves in a way that seemed like it was fairly representative of what a normal night out here would be, and I appreciated the heck out of it.  Of all the many bars and businesses we went to that evening, Roast was the only one you'd find me patronizing on my own volition on a regular day... plus, (as mentioned earlier) basket-o-fries. Yes. Count me in and count me in balls deep. Fry me.

I'm not super big on holiday sh*t. In fact, I f*cking hate it. But when I hear there's a market that has hand-made this & that and beer aaand outdoor grilling... well, now you've piqued my interest.   Right off the bat I liked this event because I got a free full-size Fuze beverage thing before I even walked in the door. I'd never tried Fuze before and I'm also very poor so the idea of being able to get something tasty for $0 was, as you can imagine, a pretty big draw for a hoodrat like me. moving on...  On a late Saturday afternoon the market was reasonably packed, but not as bad as some the hand-made markets with beer that I've attended back home. I like that the vendors were set up a bit segregated so anything with or for kids was kind of off to the side since kids are infamous for gumming up the works at crowded fests. The separation helped me avoid any situations where I might have to explain myself after "accidentally" kicking some child who's not yet mentally capable of recognizing the unspoken but agreed upon social flow of the marketplace, and over all kept the babies and their P's out of my impatient hair though there was at least one mother(f*cker) who thought the busy and crowded market was the perfect place to teach her 10-month old how to walk, and for that I mentally sentenced her to death by antique steam-punk firing squad... which conveniently there was a booth for.   There were a few really neat vendors but because it seemed like most or all were to limited to their area of one standard-size folding table and the space behind it. I don't think shops were able to display too many items and I'm going to assuming that because of the table-size limitation. Vendors had to pick and choose a limited variety of stock to bring/display and that caused a lot of the vendors inventory to look really mis-matched and random. As an example, it seemed pretty par for the course to see one single vendor selling art prints of movie stills, knit owl barrettes and steam-punk business card holders, and while I'm sure there's a market for all of those things, there was a disconnection in the goods that translated to making the table look less desirable.  On the other hand, because vendors had just a single table space and not an area where they could create a store cubby type nook with multiple tables and curtains, there was no getting grid-locked into a booth and not being able to get in or out or even see the goods. You were able to walk straight through the three main aisles and pretty clearly see what kind of stuff each vendor offered without having to squish in and fight for a spot to view the table, which was really nice and saved a lot of time, though it did mean that each shopper spent less time looking at a vendor's goods than the cubby/nook mock storefront way where you sort of get sucked in and trapped in into looking more and buying more.   My favorite booths were the craft beer candles that smelled fantastic and were in old glass beer bottle that had been sawed in half and smoothed over as well as the super crowded jewelry vendor in the very back. I ended up getting (or being gifted by a very special someone) this bullet necklace I'd been eyeing.   This market was great because while the shopping was all indoor, there was a beer tent outside, a hula hoop station (also a vendor) and multiple local restaurants had brought their goods and set up shop to grill on the plaza outside the market. And while everything smelled like delicious, smoky heaven, the lines were wrapping around the nearby businesses so we opted to wait it out and grab food elsewhere.   I would definitely recommend I made it market to anyone with an urge to shop local and an hour or so to kill. It's not a destination or all day type thing, but it's a great mix of quality craft and the community, as well as being far from any super boring Holly Hobby church craft fair type thing. Check it out when it's in town. It's totally free to attend and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends, fam, kids or just yourself.

Fox was fine, I guess, thoughI totally feel like they would have tried to pull some shady sh*t had my friend and I not known better.   The service you'll get will be subpar and at a snails pace. If you're lucky you'll get there when there isn't a rush because just a few people in line ahead of could easily mean back-ups of over an hour.   It's definitely a budget car rental place, although we paid only a nominal amount less than we would have at one of the shinier more nationally known rental places thanks to spring training.   Make sure you get a sheet to mark down where there are scratches and any damages to the vehicle before you leave. They initially didn't give us one and kind of tried to play dumb about it until realizing that we weren't idiots. I was glad we didn't just trust them because while our car was fine for the most part, it had considerable scratches to pretty much every part of the car, some far worse than others. Luckily, we marked it all down before getting in the vehicle and weren't charged for anything.   Beyond some better staff training, I'd suggest Fox not give you an unbreakable key ring with all 3 sets of giant keys attached. If all the keys are together, you don't really need 3 of the same key. Just give one. Or, present the keys like a normal human being would and give the renter two separated keys so they have a back up and so they don't have to carry around 3lbs of of the same car key on a massive bike lock ring.

I can't even tell you how badly I wanted to steal the desert animal throw pillow from the bed but I refrained.   Probably only 10% of the refraining came from being a non-degenerate while the other 90% of the reason I didn't steal the pillow was because A. It wouldn't fit in my carry on, and B. there was so much cool stuff in the room/hotel I would've felt I was cheating the other stuff by not stealing them away with me, too.   It's connected to a cute little modern-ish diner called The Normal and an excellent taco bar called Tapacubo, but beyond that I don't think this area is too much of a happenin' place. Luckily, I was here for work and scheduled from morning through night so I needn't worry about growing bored. Plus, they have a nifty little pristine pool and hot tub that I 100% would have been fine spending my entire stay at.   Oh, there's also a rooftop bar area where they sometimes host rooftop yoga (we took a class and it was super fun) and probably the best and least stuffy conference room I've ever been in.  Large floor to ceiling windows facing the world, coffee and snack bar, and a giant projector with probably the best picture display I've ever seen.   Before coming here, my friend and I had a mini spa weekend in Tuscon at sprawling resort and golf club... and I honestly liked The Graduate better. I'd come back in a heartbeat... just save me a lounger in the sun by the pool.
