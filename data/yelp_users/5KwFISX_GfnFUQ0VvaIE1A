I've seen two movies here, and wouldn't have returned today if the movie weren't free... (We were seeing an advance screening of Super-8 today!) Though I doubt I'd return even for a free film after today's experience. Without going into a detailed story:  -The seats are mildly uncomfortable but distractingly noisy - they squeak whenever anyone adjusts position in their seats, so all film long. -The popcorn is priced as though it were premium, but even the "actually premium" flavored popcorns, at $7 for a medium, are not fresh, which was a major disappointment for the price. Their standard popcorn was mediocre.  WORST: They have all-digital projection, which I usually prefer, but the projector in the theater I was in today (#2) was out of alignment somehow. The distance between the red and blue light, on the right half of the image, was enough that it felt like I was watching one of the old red-blue 3D films; the colors were all off and there were colored halos around anything high-contrast. If I had paid for tickets, I would have walked out in the first minute.  Annoying seats, mediocre concessions, and to top it off bad projection? I guess if you were drinking at their bar, you might not notice? Ugh.

Had a dinner date here & it was one of the highlights of our trip to Vegas last week--it helps that we already love both pub food and British fare in general.  Briefly: The shepherd's pie was excellent, and my wife devoured her lamb burger with much love. We think the real highlights were the starters and desserts, though; the "Pub Spots" (sliders) were phenomenal, and we think well worth the price. We ordered 3 desserts to share (though it turned out to be too much by that point in the meal, and we left a little at the table) and while all were bliss-worthy treats, the sticky toffee pudding was the standout favorite (and the only one entirely finished).  A bit pricey, but more affordable for us than, say, Gordon Ramsay Steak and (we think) worth it. The service we received (it was relatively early; we arrived around 5:30PM for dinner) was excellent, and we never felt we were waiting long for anything--and there was always someone to hand to take a plate or refill a drink or whatever was needed.   After watching Ramsay on TV for a few years, it was nice to be able to see that he really does run (or at least put his name on) well-run restaurants with great food and service. We probably won't return, but it'll be because we've saved up for Steak, next time we want to do Ramsay in Vegas!

My wife and I have been members of Fill A Seat for almost two years now, and we love it. We could never afford to be regular attenders of the symphony, ballet, plays, or concerts; maybe a couple of performances a year, within our limited budget--but with Fill A Seat we regularly attend them all! I can't recommend Fill A Seat enough, to anyone interested in taking in some of the broad range of culture Phoenix has to offer.  There are a couple of venues whose shows we avoid due to mandatory parking fees or drink purchases, but we get more than enough value from our membership without them--and if you're already used to paying for drinks & parking when you go out, you'll get even more value from your membership than we do.  The closest thing I have to a complaint is that we have to check the site/app several times a day (during the season--not much going on in the summer) if we want to be sure we get tickets to the best events; there's almost never a notification when an event is posted (and when there is, their site sometimes can't handle the traffic), and sometimes only a few tickets are available, so it's easy to miss out on a hot ticket. We just make it a part of our normal daily routines, now, and have seen 95% of everything we were interested in over the last year--not a big deal, but something new users ought to be aware of.

Very happy with this location & the quality of care after 2 annual visits; hoping to continue return every year. Prompt service, easy appointment scheduling, covered by our insurance. Staff is very friendly and, in the brief period spent waiting (while my wife is having her exam & vice versa) they're pleasant to chat with. The actual exam process is quick, clean, and efficient.   Admittedly, we don't have complex needs (yet)--single vision, glasses (no contacts), no other eye/vision problems, so YMMV.
