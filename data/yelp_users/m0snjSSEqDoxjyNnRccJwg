The best service I have ever had at a mobile phone store!! We thought we were going to lose all of our info on a phone and they were so helpful that we were able to salvage everything. Kegan was especially helpful and we couldn't be happier with the our experience.

I had a phenomenal experience and I had so many compliments about how great my hair looked. I have super curly hair and wanted somebody else to straighten it because I was having surgery the next day and didn't want to fuss with my hair for a few days.  I am so happy with the service I highly recommend coming here and I will be back frequently.

Worst chiropractor ever!  I had two obvious herniated discs that he missed and I had diagnosed later that week with a much more competent doctor.  Walked into his office and limped out.  After I explained the position he put me in was already painful he continued to crack my back which left me in extreme pain and much worse than when I got on his table.  He only partially reimbursed me and let me limp out of the office.  I was a collegiate gymnast and broke many bones with surgeries  so please don't think I have a low pain tolerance I just want you to be aware of this quack.
