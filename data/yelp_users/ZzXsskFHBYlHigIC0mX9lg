I've seen a lot of these stores both in Mexico & here in the Phoenix area since I've lived in AZ for decades, but this is the first time I've been to this one. WOAH - looks small from the front & then it unfolds room after room, then more outside in the back. It really is a comprehensive store for items from Mexico. I guess the owner does a route thru MX to his vendors in various places - it shows.   You'll see every item you regret you didn't buy on that last vacation to Mexico. Except the 8-foot metal T-rex. I had to ask, as I have fantasized for years about planting one on my front lawn just to see how long the very strict HOA would take to get that warning letter to me.  The guy at the store told me they don't bother buying the big dinosaurs because they rarely sell (guess I'm not there only one who snaps back to urban reality at the point of sale).   FYI, if you want a giant metal T-rex, go to Mesa - there's been one for sale for a few years on E Main St  :-)   (Edit) LOL - Aileen's compliment made me realize I forgot to say YES, we bought a lot of things!  We were there for the latest wave of outdoor patio decorations. Left with 2 big pots, some various wall art pieces, & a leather belt. They came down in price some at the register.  Not like deep MX bargaining, but enough to make DH happy.

Date night, wanted to try a new place. Called to see if getting a table at 8 pm on Sat night would be a problem, she said no, come on down. We wanted to love it, as it's not far from home. It hurts me to give a place with a new owner a mediocre review. But I have to be honest.  Happy that we caught Notes from Neptune playing music which is only once a month; they were REALLY good. Relaxing yet upbeat, nice sax & voices, & not too loud to hold a conversation; well-done choice of entertainment.  The blonde server helped me choose a wine, let me try one I was considering, which I appreciated.   My husband got beef sliders. They were tasty & toasted buns were a nice touch. They came with a few (a FEW) fries that seemed to be made from delicious, creamy potatoes, but were sadly soggy even though they looked pretty well-done.   I ordered two apps instead of a meal - the sweet potato chips (server said they are delicious, made fresh to order) and the brussel sprouts.   We did have a staggered order, as I took a while to decide on my food. Slider order went in first. But once I did order, I waited a LONG time for the chips, much longer than the turnaround for my husband's sliders. The menu says "hand cut," so maybe they actually grab a raw potato and start carefully slicing when the order makes it into the kitchen?  However, I would then expect them to be uh-oh hot. When they arrived, they had NO heat at all. Given my history as a server & restaurant manager, I'm guessing then they were left in the window a while before making it to our table.  The sweet potato chips were a shockingly small portion for the $5 price - I had to hide my surprise when they were delivered. You gotta know, we are NOT "big portion" people, we often split an entree when we go out, as we are not fans of the "more is better" concept.  But for $5, this was ridiculous, a HANDFUL. My husband sincerely said to me, "I planned to have a few, but I'd feel guilty, as you won't have enough." I should have counted, could have very easily and quickly, but didn't think about it before I dove in since I was hungry. They are thin-cut, come in a cutesy little mini-deep fryer basket lined very loosely with waxy paper that therefore holds them up higher than the bottom of the basket (like the gift basket trick of putting in a false bottom to lift up the gift items). Therefore, initially they look mounding out of the little basket, with a honey dip ramekin nestled in there with them (taking up yet more space NOT full of chips). Once I removed the ramekin and looked inside, I could no longer deny that yes in fact this was a - forgive me, owner - rip off. I know what a sweet potato costs, even an organic one bought at retail price at "Whole Paycheck" grocery store. I'm all for places making a nice profit, but honestly... I felt kinda "taken" by that app. If it had been delicious, maybe if it had "wowed" me (I LOVE sweet potato anything), but they were un-warm, not much flavor, and the honey aioli didn't improve them for me at all (I set that to the side after two tries).   The brussel sprouts for some reason took another 15 - 20 minutes PAST the chips to arrive (no exaggeration, the band took their entire break & went back to playing while we waited for the brussels). But when they finally arrived, YUM! we agreed we should have skipped the chips AND the sliders, and just had multiple order of the brussels. (But that would be weird, "Hi, just 2 orders of brussel sprouts, please," - not a reason to return). They were delivered hot, and their weight pushed that little piece of wax paper all the way down into the cutesy basket, no space-robbing ramekin, so I'm happy to say said basket was joyously full. We didn't mind paying $6 for those!  (Surely the brussel sprouts cost more than a small sweet potato?? Don't understand pricing logic here).  Music really saved the whole experience from being really mediocre. Server was very nice, but either she screwed up my order and 1. left my first item in the window and 2. forgot to put in my second item for a long time, OR this is normal kitchen flow (she didn't say anything like, "sorry for the wait," so maybe this is normal?). Either way, unimpressed.   SUMMARY: We agreed nothing to bring us back. However, we could see it's potential. If you hit it for happy hour prices and the music is good, and maybe when the patio is open, and the kitchen and servers are humming along, it could be a fine place to go, as others describe.  Moving on...........  P.S. - Funny, I just saw that "Phyllis" mentioned an odor the same night we were there. We were not sitting near either bathroom. I asked my husband at one point, "Did you fart?" He looked shocked, swore no (and he's pretty trustworthy on that Q.) A little while later I smelled a waft again... and I realized it was the same sewage smell that happens in public bathroom drains from time to time.

Wonderful locally owned place, no wonder it's survived 20 years! I have been here a few times over 10 years & forgot to check in. Feel bad I never wrote a review until now!  Happy hour is 3-6, Good drink deals. $5 house wines that don't suck, $4 Mich Ultras, & a GREAT list of $5 food items that definitely fills me up for "dinner." However, CHECK OUT the specials... They are impressive, gourmet.   Service is friendly, genuine. The owner Debbie is AMAZING, she CARES. Like a friends' place. Atmosphere is classy, relaxed elegance. There is background music playing, but you can have a conversation without raising your voice.  SLEEPER TIP: CHECK OUT the cocktails menu!! I've always ordered wine. Finally saw the cocktails list - these are NOT the boring cocktails. These are CRAFT. The owner made my Hibiscus Kick all fresh. I was SHOCKED at how delicious & balanced it is... I expected too sweet... I'M delightfully WRONG!  In a sea of chain restaurants, I LOVE this neighborhood place!

I drink simple brewed coffee, prefer dark, bold & rich. If a place doesn't have something like this brewed, I might order an Americano. Therefore, I judge coffee places on their.......COFFEE.  The Bean has GREAT brewed coffee.  They are fantastic with samples of whatever they have brewed, and I find there coffees very smooth. They are actually the only place where I sometimes ordered the day's flavored coffee; for some reason, their flavored actually tastes good to me with a little half and half, while most places taste like fake-flavored coffee, overdone on the additive flavor.  The baristas ALWAYS offer to make a fresh pot of flavored if it's past 11 and I'm interested in it. I think that's amazing... but I can't let them seemingly waste a whole new pot of it on me?  If I ever have to wait for a new pot to brew, they are always amazingly nice about it, no matter what location I go to.  I like the living room feel of this location, the couch, comfy chairs, and big "conference" type table. I also like sitting outside if it's not too hot; somehow I enjoy it out there, even though I'm looking at a parking lot & Chandler Blvd. Maybe the coffee is just that good to me...  I can run a card for that simple cup of coffee, which yes I have had to do before. They never give me any grief about it.  Love the company, period!

They are a REAL costume shop all year round! You can pick up some cheap, fun costume items, or you can spend big dollars buying or renting show quality wigs, outfits, accessories, etc. They are really helpful with helping you locate items in the look and price range you need. You can also just rent single pieces to complete a look, such as a hat, or pair of shoes.  When I just got too busy to return the item, I called and they were great about extending me another day at no extra charge, THANKS GUYS!

Set your expectations accordingly. I will note I don't go during "prime time" like Saturday - I seem to end up there off hours.  I usually ONLY get toe nail polish (no pedicure, no thx), because as others said, the hand-painted designs are AMAZING and long-lasting. HUNDREDS of designs to choose from of ANY style-type you are, themes for every holiday, every season, interest, color-scheme, even Hello Kitty, cows, beach scenes, various fruits, sports teams, etc.  Crazy-good. Design stays on for MONTHS... they don't actually "wear off," they are actually half grown-out before they look so bad I have to go back!  I have also gotten gel fingernails twice now, and the do fine and it lasts 2-3 weeks as they promised.   It's not "luxury," the girls work very fast & don't chat much due to language barrier. But this isn't spa pricing, it's good pricing, fast work, long-lasting nail work.  I would NOT recommend it for a "spa" experience, which seems to be the reason many Yelpers are disappointed.

BLOWN AWAY.... This eye doctor CARES ABOUT HIS PATIENTS like they are loved ones! I took my son to Dr. Woolf regarding orbital implant issues (he has a prosthetic eye). My son is 16 yoa. Dr. Woolf talked to HIM, asked HIM all the Qs (knowing of course that I was listening too and would fill in any blanks).  He stated that the logical and right initial approach was to try the least costly, least invasive method of solution, versus ordering expensive tests right from the start. I was swooning right there - how refreshing.  Unfortunately, our initial efforts didn't solve the problem. We then played phone tag for a few days regarding setting up an MRI. Each call was from Dr. Woolf personally. After a few days of missing each other, he left me his PERSONAL CELL PHONE # to call if I had any questions beyond the voice mail info he was leaving.   I know it's truly rare and impressive to have a call back from a doctor themselves... I didn't know ANY docs in the USA ever gave out their cell # anymore......  WOW.    Every employee in the office is a "real" person too, very NICE people working there. They also have a retail optical shop for glasses and contacts - consider giving them your biz instead of the giants.  They deserve a huge flood of business!!!!!!!

ONE STAR DINNER - I wish I could give this a higher rating. The 2nd star is ONLY for the flamenco show, which was fun, and a little 3-yr-old flamenco dancer stole the show.  We used the Entertainment coupon, 2-for-1 dinner up to $20. "Greeted" at door by a sour-faced older white guy who made it VERY clear we were late for our reservation & he didn't approve. We noticed, however, that the seating was very empty, and even at the end of dinner, there was no one waiting for tables.  Friendly waiter, but got busy and never asked if we wanted another round of drinks even though my glass sat empty perched at the edge of the table.   The sangria... Meh. I ordered it here about 5 years ago, it was better that night. Tonight it tasted like red wine, a little fruit juice, and water, as if it used to be iced down, but it melted. My husband agreed. I was going to order a different drink, but the waiter never asked.   The meal - we didn't want paella, which is supposedly something they make decently. We got a steak and a chicken breast dish. The steak was "fine,' not good flavor but edible. My 2 boneless chicken breasts were perfectly uniform under a mushroom sauce. The mushrooms were sadly just canned, button mushrooms - I expected savory sauteed mushrooms, I got a weird pickled twang. The chicken was WEIRD. Reminded me of institutional cafeteria food, couldn't place it. After two bites, I quit. My husband tried it - they were so "uniform" because they were like large un-breaded McNuggets - like pressed chicken, we think. GROSS.  The cookedveggies were actually fresh, but sadly doused in so much garlic powder I couldn't do more than a few bites.   Even though I didn't eat the chicken dinner, no point in asking for a refund, since it was the $20 of the 2-for-1 (although the coupon does charge 18% gratuity on full price before discount, so the waiter got a couple of extra pity bucks. it's gotta suck to serve such bad food).   SUMMARY: I cringe to say this, but that was the worst dinner I've had in a LONG time. ONLY GO FOR THE SHOW!

As a real Yelper, gotta say I think some of the 1-stars are b.s... Esp  those with few other reviews or others who say "go to xxx instead." PLEASE....  ANYWAY... FANTASTIC Village Salad (horiatiki) - feta chunks, greek olives, etc, no lettuce, real Greece-style. The dressing has red wine vinegar but it doesn't have the stinging bite, absolutely FANTASTIC. Also LOVE the chicken on skewers, tender, flavorful, WONDERFUL. BONUS: SANGRIA ROCKS!! I try it a lot of places & the way thru do it here is Mt favorite style... Strong bite yet sweet. The fettucine Alfredo is GOOD if you like it LIGHT - we do! Not gooey, more milk consistency, nice nutmeg touch to it. FRESH veggies as a side, nice & crisp, sauteed lightly, which is what we prefer.  2nd time here- different chef, we can tell, but just as good!

I heard of Penzy's, but thought, "How big of a deal can a spice store be?" Then I came to Penzys... And now I understand. The quality is unbelievable, everything has such incredible loud flavor for whatever it's supposed to be. Every item is available to smell or taste in the store. When you read about the lengths they go to to source spices and keep them fresh, they're kind of insane. And I'm great with that. I cook A LOT & I make really flavorful dishes, so I can't bring myself to buy spices anywhere else now!  The employees are clearly passionate about spice, and really helpful with suggestions.  TIP: make sure you sign up for their mailing list, as on the catalog you'll consistently get coupons for free spices throughout the year, as well as some great recipes.

The bookstore averages much better than a 1 star & overall deserves it - all the wonderful reviews will keep it's overall score high. I have always loved this place, happy to support local over big chains... But tonight I received HORRIBLE closing-time customer treatment & thus the 1 star is a review of tonight.   Apparently I had the audacity to enter @8:45pm. I needed to pick up a business book or two for my husband. I was friendly to the girl pushing carts in from the sidewalk, "Are you still open?" "Well... We close in 15 minutes." (great, that's plenty of time to get what I want).   Another girl walks directly to me in the isle, no smile: "Ma'am, we close in 15 mins." umm... Okay, I got it. Feeling the pressure & trying to be respectful of their closing time, I intercepted the same gal a minute later to ask for guidance in where to find the section I needed. (If getting me out was so important, I was surprised that I didn't get a "Can we help you find anything?" from anyone on the floor).    5 mins later, the same girl walks right to me with the same dead-pan expression: "Ma'am, we close in 10 minutes." My reply: "I don't want to sit & read, I'm buying a specific book." (again no offer to HELP me find what I'm looking for to speed me along). She just replies, "We have to tell you every 5 minutes," and turns & walks away.  Sure enough, 5 mins later, as promised, she walked toward me... I watched her walk all the way to me. My 2 chosen books are in my hand. I smiled at her as she approached, thought maybe she'd crack a smile of recognition that this-is-sort-of-weird-but-I'm-supposed-to.... Nope. She just said u-know-what. It was so weird that I just sort of laughed & started toward the register. I was OUT THE DOOR 2 mins before 9pm, CH was up by my $28.   Cashiers there are usually friendly, but he was flat too. I have committed no customer-crime, people, YOU WEREN'T CLOSED YET!!! You're a BOOKSTORE, not a restaurant- it's not like my scanning the shelves kept you from cleaning a grill or sweeping floors. No one seemed to recognize that my purchase just paid for a few hours on YOUR PAYCHECK.  Maybe the guy from Ratt that spoke tonight was mean to all of them. Maybe middle-aged Ratt groupies swarmed & threw their  panties all over the store, & I arrived just as they picked up the last of them. I don't know, but that was just unanimously  poor customer treatment & next time I'm shopping for books on line; we can wait 2 days for shipping.   Check my review history - very rare I give anything less than stellar reviews. Changing Hands, you sure "got me out of there" tonight... And forever more.

Update Aug 2013  I made this review, got a response from a manager, replied to him, and then nothing more. I forgot about it, as it didn't matter to me anymore. A few months later, I got a call from a woman manager who said she apologizes, they didn't see that I had replied to another manager's comment to my original 1-star review. She was embarrassed so much time had passed. She said the actually listened, realized managerial influence was light at closing, and don't know things had gotten this way. They actually appreciated my constructive criticism & have CHANGED things at closing. That is actually what I HOPE FOR with every not-good review I leave. She enticed me to come back with a thank you gift for me at the desk. Already used some of it, good for her!  Ritz Carlton knows that the best way to make a customer for life is to take a bad situation and make it RIGHT, makes people even more devoted than when everything goes fine. Seems Changing Hands has done some loyal customer homework...

I LOVE SAVERS. I don't know how they do it, but they manage to not feel "icky" our have that SMELL the other thrift store chains have...   Well organized, best deals if you get their free Savers card & pay attention to discount days. The employees are nice & actually have some fun together in this store, with the announcements on the mic. Makes me laugh. Bonus for a thrift store.  Go being open to finding treasures, feel for good fabrics, check labels & you'll score. Oh, & eat first! Too many times I went in for a quick trip, got sucked in, & 3 hours later I'm ready to chew my own arm off.  IN TEMPE, DO NOT PARK IN FAST FOOD PARKING LOT! THEY DO TOW!!!

Monday... BIG screen football, volume up, don't come here Mon night if you don't want to be immersed in football. $5 burgers that are reg $10, combined that with happy hour deals 4-7 pm every day of delicious GOOD drafts for just a bit over $3 & all flatbreads & apps 1/2 price. At normal prices I would feel more 3-star. But if you know what you are getting into & come for deals, it is great for what it is.  Waiter was VERY knowledgeable of menu, helpful with suggestions.    Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors, big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks, interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets, with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in.

Saturday 5:15 pm. Our first time here. Service prompt, very polite. Servers checked on us as a team, no complaints at all! Food all came out in good timing.   Egg rolls delicious, very crisp, fresh inside, not greasy. Chicken wings... tried them only b/c of the Yelp comments... They really are that good, nice & crispy, & the sauce that comes on the side is addictive! Thom Kha soup FANTASTIC, chose chicken in it, & as others mentioned, this places uses great white meat!  We both ordered Thai iced tea, sweet but not overly sugared. Then switched to hot tea which was unsweetened & surprisingly delicious in flavor, what the heck?!   Our appetizers were so shockingly fresh & good that we skipped an entree & simply ordered another round of wings & egg rolls.  WE WILL BE BACK!

They are open 24 hrs. The employees are always nice and helpful.  Always neat and clean. They have some groceries including cold and frozen. This location has a liquor dept, and the other chick is right - FUNNY older guy there often. Totally talked me into buying whip cream vodka when I just went to the counter to buy a wine opener! I don't even drink foofy booze. I came back home & my husband was like, "HUH?" ha ha  (and yes, it's good, the guy was right).

THANK YOU, YELPSTERS, for giving us the "courage" to branch out! We are having sooo much fun trying independent places instead of big chains; we are discovering a new world of great places right here within a few miles of us...  Based on what others say, I think we made a good decision in going when Teharu is busy, a Friday night. 2 of us waited about 15-20 mins for seats, which was fine. Because they were so busy, all of the sushi we had off the belt was fresh & delicious, lots of variety. It's not super high-end gourmet sushi, but we didn't expect that from a volume revolving place. A nearby diner ordered special custom items & said he's happy every time & that the staff is wonderful about special requests. He also says the variety is constant, regardless of traffic flow.  We tried a bunch of different things. We like the belt, as we branch out from menus; "What the heck? It's $1.50/$2, let's try one!" Although of course personal preference plays into it, all were really good in flavor & quality. I had plenty & my teen stuffed himself (that means a lot of plates), plus a soda & a $4 big asian beer, all totaled about $24. WOW.

The BEST veggie pizza I have ever has in my life! I'm not a vegetarian. The flavor is nice and strong, not wimpy like most. Teen son tried it & asked to keep the rest of the slice - crazy good for anyone. His black bean quesadilla & side salad was delicious & neither of us love black beans... Our service was great, red haired younger woman, very friendly & helpful. Great world music playing. LOVED IT.   We felt energized by the good quality food, environment & company.  Wish they were closer to us!  No, it's not cheap - but that quality of ingredients isn't cheap for them to buy.

In the mood for something different than Mexican & sushi. Saw the 4.5 Yelp review, not a fan of anything British as a general rule, but what the heck, all the Yelpers can't be wrong, & they served food until MIDNIGHT!  Frankly, I expected it to be "good, but not my style," as I prefer lighter, healthier food for the most part, NOT a "meat & potatoes person."  Went there alone since my family wasn't with me. I was a very "un-hipster" 40-ish yr old female alone. As I walked up I noted the loud patio, people having fun/drinking, hmm. Inside: dark but not in a seedy way, real wax dripped down the wine bottles holding the candles. Church pew seating as mentioned. Pretty cool, but the tables looked huge & daunting for this SWF diner. The outside looked too "party".   No one really approached me right away, a few people said hi, but they all looked so casual sans uniform, I couldn't quite tell if they worked there or just walking by?  Didn't know if I should wait to be seated, but there was really no obvious place to wait for such guidance, as the front door leads right into the dining room. After a few awkward seconds I identified that guy as definitely an employee & threw myself at his mercy, "Hi. I'm new. How does this work?"  He was great, sit anywhere. Grabbed a seat at the end of the raised bar. As someone else said, a good place to bolt from if things didn't go well. Also had a good view of the dining room, the kitchen prep area & the servers work area.   Friendly Serena stopped by, I warned her too that I was new. She was great! Since they clearly have a great, well-chosen list of ales & beers & that seems an obvious British accompaniment to pastys, I told her some of the beers I normally liked, such as IPAs, Kiltlifter, Dogfish Head 60 & 90. She lit up & said she's bring a sample of one she thinks I'd like. Love the service already!! I love love love when they bring samples of something so you can truly decide before committing. She NAILED IT - On-tap Green Flash Hop Head Red. Never heard of it, LOVE IT.  Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good. Waited the 15 mins or so. Noticed that the servers have fun, the kitchen is friendly like everyone says, the crowd is diverse.  The music is great, stuff I like, upbeat, some good swing-dancing music, Stray Cats, etc. Only thru Yelp reviews did I learn it's now "hipster" music, ha ha. Then arrived the pasty...  SOOOO much better than a typical calzone crust! I love how thin but sort of crisp the crust is! Nothing even close to doughy, it's lightly holding the divine insides. The Chicken was moist and chunky, the tikka masala sauce was spiced but not "hot," really savory flavor.  The side sauce was perfect with it, nice touch that they all have various perfect accompaniment sauces! I asked Serena for a box right away to take the other half home to family. Good thing I did, or I would have stuffed myself with it because it was sooo tasty & been in pain later.  I'm also not really much of a dinner-out dessert person, as they are usually too over the top gooey sweet for me. But the Banoffee Pie with bananas caught my eye. Home-made caramel? In home-made graham crust? What??  Argh, okay....  I can have a few bites & take the rest home.  Serena was again brilliant, telling the kitchen to "build it" in the to-go container. Once it arrived, I could see why, truly awesome suggestion, as moving it would have messed it all up. The guy behind the counter asked,  "Just bananas or also strawberries?" I deferred to Serena the Expert... "Plus strawberries."   He told me when busy, he doesn't have time to create this masterful work of art that he made, but tonight he was able to do so. It was beautiful, and tasted 10 times better. I couldn't stop. I didn't know why. Finally, another server stopped by and we chatted about it. The secret is: the caramel is sweet, the graham crust is both sweet & salty, & the whipped cream isn't sweetened at all. The balance is WONDERFUL! Scary-wonderful: "...just one more bite, then I will close the box..."  Thanks, Cornish Pasty, will be back with many others really soon!!!

I'm not into hotdogs. I'm DEFINITELY not into twinkles.   The Twilly Dog is a dessert like thing, not the main course hotdog. A hotdog in a Twinkie, with peanut butter, & it WORKS. IT'S GOOD. If you are a health food person like me who prefers the Whole Foods hot bar over any fast food, just don't think too much about the Twilly, get a friend to order it, and take one big middle bite. It will confuse you, because by God It's truly tasty.  If you want a great story of inspiration from the Food Gods, ask Randy how he came up the Twilly.  Randy, the owner (no, his name isn't Willy), greeted us like we just entered his home. His daughter helped us choose the best dogs for our tastes. Ask them, take their recommendation. Whatever we chose was the BEST hotdog I've ever had (something with bacon, I don't know), including compared to a Chicago dog from a lakeside cart in Chicago, and a hotdog off a cart in NYC.    Read the articles on the wall by the door, this guy is passionate about not dogs, and is on a mission of more than food....

NEW OWNERSHIP as of JULY, 2013!! I first used this place in 2011, great pricing, fresh bulbs often, immaculate, quick. The girls that worked there were always nice & still are, but the previous owner constantly put people off by seeming very unfriendly/flat-line personality, as some have commented in reviews before 7/2013 (I continued anyway b/c I like everything else about it).  I thought she just disliked ME until I realized, no, it's just her personality, ha ha!    Under new ownership, the place is still IMMACULATE - like EAT OFF THE FLOOR CLEAN. They give you no grief about coming in at end of night, every employee & now owner included is CHEERFUL, and even the decor has been cheered up just a bit, more color added.    I hear there's a place nearby that is going for "cheap" but you have to clean your own beds & quality control is poor... I'm willing to pay just a bit more, still a great deal, to put my bare skin onto towels & beds that I know are cleaned very well between every client, and a tanning bed that will be well-maintained, cuz let's face it, we're kinda microwaving ourselves naked.... LOL

As a Yelper, I feel bad I've never reviewed SCNM  before!   I've been taking my family to Southwest (not "Scottsdale" as one bad reviewer thinks it's called) Naturopathic Medical Center for 15 years. I appreciate that they ask EXTENSIVE Qs to dig into the root of the issue, unlike regular MD office visits that just ask symptoms & slap a creme or pill on it to make the symptom go away! (Something CAUSES the problem, & it's not a deficiency in the body of antibiotics or steroid creme...)   I appreciate that they are coming from the perspective that our bodies are designed to heal themselves and be well, and when they aren't, we need to provide support.   They have a beautiful "green" facility on Broadway just west of the 101 - convenient to get to.  It's a teaching college, so I always agree to "student visits," (students come in with the docs) as it saves on the cost of the appointment. Private practice naturopaths have to charge more. Considering we don't have health insurance, I find SCNM's appointment costs VERY fair & reasonable for the time and true CARE they extend!   We have seen many of the docs over time. Different personality styles, but all have procured effective solutions to the problems presented. Have to say, though... we LOVE Dr. Sims! She's not only a great doc, her attitude & energy is awesome. She's actually fun to see :-)  Most recently, 3 mos ago, we brought my husband in for rash on his neck that had been going on for months. He'd NEVER had anything like it in his many decades on Earth. He went to the VA (it's free for him), they gave him steroid creme which would back down the rash for a while. Said the reason was "Probably a virus, chronic, you'll never get rid of it, just use the creme."  I know it's not good to use those forever, clearly there's an issue causing it - so we went to SCNM.  They immediately asked about changes in personal products, clothing material, and diet. They suspected the problem might be eggs. They also prescribed items to help re-build his digestive system, since this sort of issue really tears it up.  My husband has eaten eggs all his life & seemingly been fine, but in the past year+, he's eaten a LOT more of them - both whole eggs & egg white protein powder. We stopped the steroid creme, removed eggs from his diet for 4 weeks, and the rash died down! In the meantime, they suggested the dietary blood panel to test for food sensitivities. (They offer the same test through LifeTime fitness, a high-quality gym - it's not some "alternative thing" that is a scam for money as the other reviewer thinks). Sure enough, it came back reactive to eggs, mushrooms, & yeast.  It does NOT mean he can't ever eat them again - he's just "overloaded" and his system is pushing back. A month or two off, then slow re-introduction. Another reviewer "doubted the results" of that test, but it doesn't mean "allergy" like anaphylactic shock or diarrhea... it can be subtle yet have a big impact inside!   One morning he had eggs while out of town - 2 days later, rash crept back for a day or two.  Since then, skin has been looking great, then last week he flared up again. We knew he didn't have eggs, what the heck? We checked the list of food sensitivities - OOPS - brewers yeast! He almost never drinks beer, but with a friend visiting, he had a few pints at a sports bar during the games. 2 days later, there was the rash again for a day or two.  THANK YOU, SCNM, for once again finding the ROOT of the problem. I trust you with the people I love the most - my husband and and son!

I'm not a regular convenience store goer, but when I go, I look for QT! This place is SPOTLESS inside & out, including the BATHROOMS, yay! The beverage selection is THE BEST of any convenience store - in addition to any normal drink you can think of, they have drinks "on tap" that I've never even heard of! I'm a coffee snob, and I was delightfully impressed by their dark roasts - rich tasting & they keep them fresh.   They even have a section of actual healthy items, protein bars, etc. One day I spent a while going through all the isles, and I'm pretty amazed at what you can buy inside a QT market, check it out for yourself.  Checkout is cheetah-FAST, like the cashiers are ready before I've even dug out my wallet! All the employees are really nice & cheerful, I like that they always say hello.  BY THE WAY, as of Sept 2014 this location has the NEW DELI KITCHEN THING, IT'S DELICIOUS & they have soft serve ice cream!

I have used Carnation twice & am booked for my 3rd visit.  I am pretty clean, often doing sinks, toilets, floors, hand smudges etc as things get dirty. But sometimes I just want it ALL CLEAN AT ONCE, which is something I frankly never do. So about once a quarter I want this plus the things done that I don't like to do, such as scrubbing the shower walls, dusting ceiling fans, etc. I pick up all clutter before they arrive, as I want to make the most of my time/money with them CLEANING not picking up stuff in the way. (frankly I'm surprised at the posted photos, I had no idea people leave their house so exploded with their personal crap when cleaning crews come... You're paying good money for someone to throw away your old fast food bags & fold your couch blanket, really?? -shrug-)  I have used various cleaning people (individuals) & discounted "services" from Groupon, etc, and all those experiences drove me to simply call Carnation. I'm tired of individuals having car trouble, not bringing their own supplies, kid-problem cancellations, no call/no shows, telling me their life problems on my cleaning "clock," = lack of professionalism. The experience with the coupon businesses has been AWFUL - I was lucky to get my money back from one that turned into a big scam that even made the news last year.   I was trying to save money in both cases; "I can get it for cheaper." I gave that up, called Carnation, willing to pay more for quality/professionalism. I have known Eugena, the owner, for many years, knew what she did & that they were a final-cleaning provider to a big home-builder for many years. You can't hold an account like that without providing consistent professionalism.  Both times Carnation has been here it has been the same delightful experience. They are a system, the individual employees can have car trouble, kid issues, etc but it doesn't affect me as the customer - I'm now willing to pay Carnation more to deal with those hassles & just CLEAN MY HOUSE. I have had a different cleaning crew both times, which is fine with me.   They came in a team of 2 in a car with the company name on it, uniforms, blue booties on their shoes. After a quick intro and tour of the house, they verified what I had said I wanted done per the phone setup, and got to work. They bring EVERYTHING they need to do the job. They worked fast, clearly had their duties split already (no confusion between them), and only talked to me when they had clarification questions.   Everything was PERFECT. They did the extras I asked for (cleaning the fans & baseboards), they did all of the basics (like scrubbing shower walls), and then they approached me at the 2-hour mark I had set up on the phone, and gave me an option - there was still one thing to complete on the list. Did I want to buy more time for that or leave it?  That was GREAT with me, as I saw them working fast & hard all 2 hours - my requests simply added up to more than 4 (wo)man-hours. So yes I happily agreed to add on 15 more mins. The office called to verify it with me (no opportunity for employees to scam). My final amount was charged to my card by the office - no awkward paying the people who just cleaned.  I am sorry to hear that the other reviewer had a poor experience and "emailed" ... makes me wonder if Mary Ann ever saw it?  I'd suggest if there's any problem at all, CALL (as in pick up the phone) IMMEDIATELY - this is not the sort of biz that will ignore dissatisfaction!!

Great prices, huge selection. Today Saturday afternoon we were exploring laminate & bamboo flooring, and 2 separate emplyees there were REALLY helpful with all of our Qs, really patient & approached US asking if we had any Qs or needed help.  Impressed.  We will be buying it there!

He's tinted 4 cars for us over 4 years time - a BMW X3, a 740 BMW, a Mercedes SL500 & another SUV. I didn't know him before I hired him - I called because I saw his website on his car in our neighborhood. Awesome work, professional, right on time as promised every time, good price.

I cannot believe people say the steak at Outback is better! If you appreciate the QUALITY of meat at a mice steakhouse, ignore those opinions. Last couple of times I went to OB, ordered the filet, told my husband I just don't want to bother anymore, as the meat is very blah, not worth it. Thus VERY happy to have found DC in the last year! If you are a sucker for seasoning salt flavor, you might not appreciate DC. If you can feel and taste the quality of a high-end cut of meat, you might be pleasantly surprised by the price point here. Steaks are 1/3 to even 1/2 what the big guys charge (depending on which high-end chain you compare price to).  We have been to DC 4 times now, great quality meat (filet, NY, Porterhouse) NOT camouflaged in "seasoning" to hide mediocre quality like Outback. Good glasses of wine, sides are typical steakhouse good, but about 1/2 what the big dog chain steak houses charge. Bread is fresh & warm. Atmosphere is nice, warm, dark-ish but not cave-like. Classy but not fussy. Great wall mural, nice use of historic space. Happy to support a local biz when we want a steak night for less than $100. I jump on the coupon every time it gets released, as we are happy with full-price here. Discounted?! AWESOME.  Basically, when we want the steakhouse experience (rather than grilling it ourselves) with a good quality cut of meat, we head to DC. Great balance of quality & price.

I love Oreganos... Been coming here for 15 years! It's a default restaurant for my family,  & the pizza cookie is a MUST on bdays - you get one for free! Great food quality, server friendliness,  interior design, t-shirt puns. Pizza cookie (chocolate chip, lightly done!). The salads are the best, even people who don't like salad like the Pablo Picasso every time.  The thin crust pizza is fantastic,  the boom dip. .. OMG. The meatballs are amazing.  The DRINKS, oh geez, the bellini is the a BEST one I've ever had!   Flavor note - Big thing for me - I DON'T LIKE SWEET TOMATO SAUCE/marinera. Oreganos sauce is savory,  not sweet. YAY! They are actually my fav marinera anywhere.

1st time here, came in 45 mins before they close, but Krista was great about us staying until 7:20 to finish our cheese plate & prosecco. She was willing to chat about cheese & their shop as long as we would engage her, even though she had things to do for closing.  We had the cheese board, and Krista cheerfully replaced a newer Gouda with an aged Gouda we had enjoyed sampling. She suggested the prosecco with our choices, which was a great idea. We had Ewephoria, a sweet, mild smooth sheep's milk Gouda; Gorgonzola Picante, a cow blue cheese; and an aged Gouda we didn't take note of, but it was butterscotch-y, crystals throughout (yum), and very orange.  They do have a great selection of beers and wines, olive oils, jams, etc, and they have great product & offerings expansion ideas as the business profits... WE WILL BE BACK!

Needed my quarterly cut and partial weave. Just didn't feel like spending the almost $200 for the resort spa salon appt, even if it DOES include all-day access to the lovely spa & pool... In the past (3+ yrs ago), I used to get my hair done at a hair school @ the C-Institute on Rural & Southern. Read it's recent reviews here & saw that place isn't rating too well, AND they dumped Aveda, changed to L'Oreal, WTH?  THANKS TO YELPERS, I CALLED TONI & GUY!!  Didn't even know about it till you guys reviewed it for me...  I called on Thur, got in for Saturday morning 2 days later, I was shocked they had space for such a long appt on a Sat a.m.  The told me if you REALLY want availability, go during the week (open Tue-Sat) - they are hungry for people to work on!  I got lost finding the place, they say "Pavillions by Mountainside Fitness." Turns out Mountainside isn't obvious - Pavillions is BIG and covers 2 sides of Indian Bend. Go to SOUTH side, west-most area of shopping center (closest to Pima Rd.) Turn south off Indian Bend at Hooters  :-)  Like everyone says, it's clean, bright, modern, and I love the big floor to ceiling windows that are in view of most stations. Walking in, it looks like a real salon. I apologized for being lost/late to the check-in guy at front desk who was friendly and nice. I noticed only the Manager lady at front desk didn't smile/greet.    Kelly was my stylist, Travis was the instructor overseeing her. Stylist Kelly was upbeat, friendly, asked a lot of questions about what I wanted, and really listened. When Travis came over to review, they had an exchange about coloring choice & method that made me feel confident about both of their abilities. As she got going, Travis came by and politely corrected her on how she was sectioning my hair, and she responded to him appreciatively. A nice exchange over my head, again adding to my confidence.  My hair turned out GREAT. She did highlights 2 to 1 with low lights, thin strands so it looks natural, and gave me a great cut resulting in exactly what I asked her for. I actually can't tell the difference in outcome from the resort salon!    I learned that if the students don't maintain at least a 90% in their courses, they're out. T&G has impeccable standards, and it shows. I also noticed the students weren't standing around gossiping or complaining out on the floor as if the customer is a mannequin head - a VERY nice change from the other school. It seems maybe T&G actually trains students to behave in a professional manner when out in "public," not sure?    I brought snacks and something to drink knowing I would be there a long time. I was there total of 4 hours, frankly only about 1 hour longer than when I go to my salon in a Paradise Valley resort.  I was out the door for $57 + an easily-afforded, much-deserved generous tip for Kelly.

We were here because of a conference being held here.  Restaurant was fine. The service was very lack-luster, but it's summer (slow) and I assumed she was new to waitressing. Turns out she isn't, she just isn't very secure with herself & doesn't understand customer service. More afraid of "getting in trouble." (verified by the manager who came over later).  They ran out of their happy hour wine, so our friends waited 20 minutes for the manager to "get a new bottle." (not exaggerating that time, actually 20 mins). Guess she got one, then realized it wasn't going to be cold soon, so finally they upgraded the wine but served at HH pricing. Good move after such a long wait to get a glass.  Unfortunately, when we asked for another glass, we were told "they are out, the manager won't let me give you more of that one." In other words, the manager didn't want to pour anymore of the upgraded wine at HH price. Okay, so we ordered the red HH wine instead.   We ordered the prime rib special. It was "fine." No complaints, but everything was very average. Part-way through dinner the glass got knocked over on accident, more full than not. We asked to get another, they made it VERY clear we would have to pay for it since it wasn't their fault it spilled....  Well they were right, but we were the table that waited 20 mins to get the first one, then were told we couldn't have any MORE of that one... In terms of food costs, how much is a few ounces of a cheap bottle of red? It lacks logic, unless they are being beaten up about budget.   I ran to the restroom to wash the red wine out of my clothing. My friend asked if they had a towel or something at the front desk, explaining wine had spilled all over me in the restaurant. They gave her a Shout wipe, which really helped. She went back to get a couple more from the front desk and was told, "We can't give out any more,  they are expensive. You can but them if you want." (hear the theme?)  She charged the little shout wipe packs to her room for I think $2 each!    Basically, I feel like what is most important to this place is survival, and they aren't doing well. The focus on the customer isn't the priority - feels like someone in the hotel's management is makiing decisions based on penny-wise, hammering fear of losing (more?) money into all the employees, thus missing where it dings the customer's experience.

Went on a Saturday night using our Entertainment coupon (which listed old address, had to call for new, they gave a nice apology). There was a party going on behind screens, all Pakistanis, women & girls in traditional wear, balloons, lots of children that were literally running though the restaurant, squealing with delight. Very glad we were not expecting a romantic dinner... We approached it as cultural diversity, chose to enjoy the loud, festive atmosphere. OK... A little annoyed when one of the little girls did a few particularly high-pitched repeated squeals, & one kid bumped my chair as they chased each other across the restaurant...  It was less than an hour of closing, so we asked if the buffet was not such a good idea (been out a while, no fresh coming). The kid waiter went to ask, and we appreciate that he returned reporting that the menu would be a better choice to insure quality.   Ordered lentil soup & sesame naan (new & listed on back pages). Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.  Then ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best. I'd prefer a bit spicier, but perfect for my husband.   We brought our beverage with us, after calling to make sure it was okay. Nothing is mentioned on the website one way or the other. They were very accommodating for this, brought us glasses, and offered an opener to use. I am under the impression there's a seating size limit to such places & not sure they don't exceed it, so I'm going to stay vague so they/we don't lose this option! It was GREAT - kept our bill nice and low.  If it wasn't for the Entertainment coupon, we wouldn't have known to try them... Now we will be back!  4 stars not five because it was really good but not mind-blowing... It would take a big wow to have me give 5. Children thing doesn't affect score, as I know that was a celebration exception, and again chose to see it as a cultural experience. Omar works part-time, very nice, friendly, good customer service. He apologized for the chaotic environment, which was nice.   Saw grumpy uncle at counter, no smile, but we didn't have any interaction with him. We were waited on mainly by a nice kid with puffy black hair, seemed a bit timid but did fine with everything. Omar came to us and chatted at the end of the evening.

Dan at Stasis is AWESOME. He's taken care of our RO system for 2 years. I love great tasting water - I'm a water princess! He has a personality, he's good at his job, he recommends only what's truly needed, not pointless up selling. I know this because I researched THOROUGHLY what my system needed at it's age... He was spot-on. His process are better then if I drove to the west side to pick up my system's needs.

Savers ROCKS! Clean, doesn't have the creepy vibe that a lot of thrift stores have. Funny to me that one reviewer said, "...go to other stores where you can get new at same price." Sure, you can get a new tee at WalMart nearby for the same $8, but there are some GREAT quality brands here, not just "cheap" stuff. This location receives donations of a lot of high-end brands/good quality stuff. I have gotten Chico's, Ralph Lauren, Tommy, Banana Republic, Nike, Hollister & more.

THE RIBS.... no bones, huge hunks of meat, smokey savory sweetness, no knife needed. And with GRITS, I LOVE grits!! With HUGE perfectly-grilled asparagus spears. Tried my friend's sautéed chard, it was done perfectly.  The desserts were good & HUGE, 4 of us didn't completely eat 2 desserts. But we were pretty full from the generous dinner portions.   Nice, easy service, didn't catch his name but he did everything needed.  It is nice inside, soothing but by no means a snoozer place. The bar is in the middle, looks like a nice after-work place to me. I saw a patio too, always a plus in the right weather. If I lived nearby, I'd be here often...

This is a simple, clean, bright, open warehouse space in the industrial area. It's off a side street to the north of Broadway, follow the BIG ARROW for the street #, and look for the actual unit #27.   Just got a 31cf LG from these guys on Friday LOVE IT - didn't know I could be so happy with a kitchen appliance!  I did my price research before arriving, so I know what my fridge costs without dings - we saved almost $1,000 by being okay with a few dings and scrapes & 1 year warranty vs. manufacturer 10-year.  I'm FINE with that - LG rates really well, it's trust-worthy.    I like that the fridges here are NEW, just got roughed up in transport. After researching the purchase, I'm wary to buy a random used one without knowing where it was kept or what rotted in it... this is a good balance of quality/condition vs. cost.  The guys are surprisingly young & sharp. They went straight to bottom line price, saving time & hassle. They offered to switch out a handle that was exceptionally dinged up, set us up with a freezer drawer that lined up perfectly, and had it delivered Monday.  We actually had fun with them joking around as we made the deal.  The dog on site is a bonus if you have to bring your kids with you... she might be the most calm dog I've ever met, likes everyone, & will be just the right amount of distraction for your kids while you shop.  The delivery company they use had 2 giant guys show up that were astoundingly polite. They were incredibly careful to not ding any corners from street to install, apologized for leaving the door open & letting the hot air in, set up the fridge and the water line, cleaned up the floor from his water test & kept referring to me as ma'am.

I saw these reviews and thought, "How in the hell can a CARPET GUY get so many 5-stars?? It's CARPET CLEANING."  And then he called (late, like someone else said, after a long workday). And then he was able to come out within a day or two, like someone else said. And then he & I had a convo about Yelp and how wonderful it is & I got a discount for being a committed Yelper. And then he showed up and I was schooled...  Until Rob walked in, I have never met anyone who is actually PASSIONATE about carpet cleaning. He's been doing it a long time, and it still actually EXCITES him. He talks about carpet stain victories like an enthusiastic fan talking about his favorite winning team. "I Clean Carpets" isn't the name of his business as much as it is his bold proclamation to Planet Earth (or at least metro Phoenix), water vacuum held high in victory stance.   He's nice, personable, really careful with stuff in the house, brought a great assistant who was just as nice. And when Rob talks dirty carpet, you can tell he's FIRED UP. He's not acting, he's not making you feel good, he's genuinely PASSIONATE about cleaning carpets.I know, I keep saying it, using all-caps. But... Huh. Who knew. Like learning about a sub-species of humans I never knew existed.  His work reflects it. Enough said - the 5-stars are actually all accurate. Craziest thing.  Only recommendation for improvement: Change the biz name from "I Clean Carpets" to "I CLEAN CARPETS!!!"

Amazing deals! Incredible selection of craft beers on tap & wines by the glass. Wine Wed means $5 wines PLUS a generous cheese plate per person with first glass.   Tell James what your tend to like & he will set you up. The ambiance of this corner of Whole Foods is so good that you will forget you are in a grocery store (especially after a couple of James' generous glasses). 3 flat screens play sports, & you can browse and buy LOTS of different ready-made foods in the food court for nosing with your drinks.

I feel bad for not even thinking to write a review for this store sooner. However, I selfishly didn't really want to add yet another great review, as I'm afraid you'll go buy out my size before I get there, ha ha. But they deserve more biz - I want them to be around a long, long time! So get in there and buy a lot like I do.  I fell in love with it when I walked by the window 2 years ago & had to have one of the cutest cover-ups I've ever seen. I was terrified to find out the price, since I was at the Quarter. Incredibly, it was WAY LESS that I expected, and WAY LESS that what a similar item would be at the other nearby active wear store - you know, the "fruit" one...?     I am on the email list for CKP & I hold myself back to shop again until the great discounts hit, then I do my sweep. I'm actually not much of a clothing shopper, yet this place has managed to get my dollars every time I go, because they have such GREAT items, CUTE designs, comfortable, well-made, and just a bit different in details. I am like a poster child for this line - more casual days that not, I'm sporting their stuff! I get a LOT of compliments on the items I have from this place. I have thus far introduced 5 or 6 friends here who are now also hooked... if I got referral credit, I think my whole wardrobe would be free :-D  As everyone says, the employees are INCREDIBLE. They are all so genuine & friendly, fun & helpful, and as mentioned - VERY VALUABLE - they will actually tell you the truth when something looks good & when it doesn't!!

AMAZING (fried) CATFISH, WTH???    I don't like fried food much, and I don't really like fried fish, like fish and chips - ugh, not my thing.  This is DIFFERENT, it was light and fluffy, delicious breaded coating that was crispy and had flavor, not greasy.  "Juicy and melt in the mouth tender" as DinerGirl says, and LOVE THE HOT SAUCE, so glad my fellow Yelpers told me to use it!  Nice big patio out front with tables to watch the light rail zoom by, nice big parking lot out back.    Wish Charlie and his wife (who are really NICE people, by the way) would relocate to the east side, as we almost never venture to their part of town, darn it!

It's a smoothie, in a bowl, so more frozen, with nothing but GENUINELY healthy ingredients, but it doesn't taste "eww, healthy"  !!   Yes, it is somewhat more expensive than ice cream or a frozen yogurt, but it really is due to the quality of ingredients. NO fillers, no dairy, no sugar, no "fake" sweeteners... your body will truly thank you.    And really, you have to get a BIIIGGG bowl with lots of extra stuff to get the price up over $10... It would be a serious M E A L ....

LivingSocial coupon deal went BADLY. Owner is way over his head with the sale of these deals - they never showed & I received a refund from Living Social.   If you would like details as to why I cannon recommend this company, please message me. I would normally post all the details, but they have my address, and I am uncomfortable with that.
