I went looking for a kolache and discovered the kolaczki.... a little flakey pastry filled with fruit or cream cheese and dusted with powdered sugar. :-)  There were a LOT of pastries to choose from as well as a few aisles of Polish grocery items. I purchased a few kolaczkis and a few mini strudels. I'll be back to try more. It's a good thing they are not close or I'd try something new every day!

I am not sure why I haven't reviewed Rosita's yet!  This is always our go to for authentic Mexican food that doesn't disappoint. I love the chicken flautas or regular chicken tacos. Kids love the cheese enchiladas. And apparently they make their red chile with beef fresh daily with a wonderful recipe that is favorite of my husband's and the server's.  The chips and salsa are full of flavor, especially when you mix in some of the hot sauce.  The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the water... It's tap and tastes terrible. Thankfully they have Pepsi products and gigantic cups to feed my Mt Dew addiction.

Quick, friendly, and reliable! I usually get my oil changed at Walmart for the convenience, but sometimes I get a coupon via text (yes, I signed up for these so it's okay), or sometimes I need other services for my car. They are close by and I always get right in. I'm glad I went in this day... Walmart had a line and the text deal was great at $17.95! Brake Masters got me right in. Oh, they also noticed a belt was going bad. I thought maybe they were trying to up sell me, but the mechanic brought the old belt in for me to check it out (I didn't ask him to, but it brought peace of mind!). Unrelated to the actual service, the water from the fountain was so good! Tap water in AZ is pretty nasty so whatever filters they have work wonders, lol. AND the energy drink was a nice touch to my day. Thanks!

Overall good selection of inexpensive, mid-quality furniture. If not for one salesperson, my review could have gone another direction. He was very helpful and came up to me several times. The other salesmen seemed to flock to the families and elderly who looked like they might make larger purchase.

I was greeted warmly. The menu items were explained well and I was even offered a sample when I couldn't decide what salad dressing to get.  The salads that were being prepared looked pretty delicious! Time to pay...  Before ringing me up, I informed the cashier that I had a Groupon to use. She said I had to have a voucher printed out. Then, she showed me a handwritten post it next to the employee phone that stated coupons must be originals, not from an email or phone. She told me it must say that on my Groupon... So I showed her. She said to me, "See! You need to follow the directions and it says 1. Print Groupon." I kindly showed her the following statement which says, "(or pull it up with our mobile app)."  She said, "I don't know how to do that. It probably is for a Phoenix location. THIS is not Phoenix." Duh, I knew where I was... exactly where the Groupon directions led me! LOL.   Anyhow, we went back and forth for a bit and she rang me up. I told her I wasn't going to get anything and she was livid... She called me rude for ordering and walking away. That's not exactly how I see it happening. She told me that she has never heard of a company giving a discount without proof of a voucher, that it would be like giving something away. Huh... sigh.   So basically my review is about customer service and not the food as I didn't get a chance to try it. Generally, Quiznos is pretty tasty too. :-(

I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews... But I love Streets of New York. The only weird thing about this location is that they have candles on the table which the pizza is usually sitting over (I think they are supposed to keep the food warm)... But none of them were lit, even ours as he set the pizza down. Ah well, it's the only pizza I ever crave and since they shut down the location close to me, I'll be back.

This restaurant is small, but crowded. I could see how waits could get long as other reviews stated. However, it was Sunday brunch time and we got right in as a party of two. The portions are HUGE and very tasty. We had the cinnamon swirl French toast and Breakfast "222". When the waitress said the French toast was a large portion, we were expecting Texas toast sized... She said, no, we use monster bread here lol. Anyways they are hand dipped and grilled, then topped with more cinnamon and honey butter. Yum! The other breakfast was two scrambled eggs, two delicious strips of thick cut bacon, and two gigantic pancakes. Even the pancakes were super thick and fluffy. I'll be back to try other items.... The California eggs Benedict looked good and German chocolate bread pudding? Omg sounds amazing!

Let me start off by saying that I love Taco Bell! This particular one, however, is at the bottom of my list. I've been back a few times, but it's always bad. The order is always wrong, usually due to the person taking the order.  This last time I got sooo sick after being the only one in my family to eat the chicken. This was my only meal of the day and about 5 hours later, I was stuck in the bathroom for 4 hours. I have no doubts it was Taco Bell as I hadn't eaten anything else that day... I won't be back for sure.

I know it's a chain, but it's a good one. This location is always clean and the food is fresh. I've never had a bad meal. The chicken is good as is the turkey. Spiral Mac and cheese and mixed vegetables are my favorite sides, but they have many more to choose from. It's nice to have a close fast food option that doesn't include a burger or anything fried.

L8 night Bingo was fun! I hadn't played since.... I was in elementary school, lol, you know the kind they do at school functions? The staff was very informative and helpful. The late night atmosphere with live DJ made it even better! They even had people up doing the Cupid shuffle, haha. I will definitely go again!

I'll give them 4 stars because they got the job done... Docking one star because it wasn't in a very timely manner. But then again, I haven't found a "timely manner" tire shop since I left he Northwest and the ever reliable Les Schwab. The warranty is great on their tires and everyone was nice enough. Just please don't say and hour to an hour and a half ... Then tell me after 2.5 hours that it's almost done, would I like to wait and get the alignment check still or come back another day. Hey, at least they gave me an oil change coupon for the hassle!

Not quite 5 star worthy, but definitely worth the trip. It's expensive ($31 for adults), so definitely try to score BOGO coupons. Also, there are a couple small rides inside that cost extra. Bottled water... $4. Yikes it can really add up! My favorite part of the whole zoo is feeding the giraffes. Not only do you get close enough to feed them, it's close enough for them to wrap their slimy blue tongues around your hand! So gross but so cool, lol. The kangaroo area is free range that you walk through, love it! Anyway, lots of animals. Warning: the indoor attractions are hot and smell horrendous :-/. Also, it's great if you love birds because there are soooo many. Oh look, more birds! So I'm not a huge zoo person... Just walking around looking at animals in cages... But this one is worth the drive for some good close ups.

Yay! I never get a donut craving, but my husband is a pastry guy, so some weekends we get donuts.  It's so nice to have an option other than Krispy Kreme and. Dunkin Donuts ... Both to which I'd prefer a bowl of cereal or some yogurt.  These donuts are so big, doughy, delicious, and not overly sweet. The hours are great for us night shifters too! 24/7!   Bosa also has kolaches! I can't wait to try them.  Now if only they'd make fruit and cream cheese kolaches, I'd have heaven less then a mile from my house, lol.   The knockoff for one star is because I'd heard about and couldn't wait to try their specialty glazed blueberry cake donut. The girl kept trying to give me a blueberry muffin. I told her no, it's a blueberry donut. I saw the buttermilk donuts and a couple others that were on their website menu listed as their specialties. She just said, "Oh, idk what that is. Blueberry muffin?" ... Weird since I see other reviewers talking and tipping about it. Lol.  All in all, great fluffy pillows of dessert we like to call breakfast, 24/7. :-)

King Tapes runs Groupons and Yelp deals often. This is how I found them. They estimated about 3-4 weeks, but called with my finished product after less than two weeks. I have used other companies, but am glad I found this one for my VHS converting needs. The quality of my old home movies are crap, but now that they are on DVD, at least they are not gone forever! Thanks so much. :-)

This is your typical breakfast/ lunch only place. I chose to go because I love one of their omelettes ... that is unfortunately now no longer on the menu. I guess they got bought out by a national change and made some budget cuts here and there. The waitress was nice enough... And after she spilled my juice all over the table, she took it off the bill (I should hope so since it was $3 for juice and she never refilled the spilled portion lol). Accidents happen so it's not because of that, but because of the "meh" food, that I won't be back.

I have been on the hunt for a new salon and I think I've finally found it! The vibe is great, the decor is trendy, and everybody seemed to work great together. Altered Ego was full of clients today, but I was about to get right in. Now let me be honest... when I made my appointment and the man on the phone said, "Okay, you're all set up with Thomas," I almost cancelled. Now this is just my own deal to get over, so I kept the appointment and headed over. The last time a man cut my hair, he nearly brushed my earring out and was soooo rough with my hair, it made my eyes water! Let me tell you, this was NOT the case with Thomas! I work nights and was pretty sleepy. He said it's okay if you pass out, lol, and I nearly did... especially during the head massage at the shampoo bowl. :-)  Thomas asked me what I wanted, confirmed partway through and asked more questions. He offered opinions and listened. I was nervous, but would not be in the future. I trust him with my hair after only one time. So I got caramel highlights, my poorly cut growing bangs blended with the rest of my hair, and lost the bluntness of my long hair in the back. I'll be back and will ask for Thomas again. Judging by the reviews though, I am guessing I could go with anybody available and walk out a happy girl!

There was a Groupon a while back that got me looking at the Yelp reviews. Though I didn't buy the Groupon, it stuck out due to reviews and the fact they are open 24 hours. My friend suggested we go and I'm so glad she did! We've been back several times and even ordered delivery at work! Working nights, we don't have many midnight delivery options, but now there is this one! I got the roast beef italiano (roast beef, garlic, spinach, and provolone) and it was so good I have yet to try anything else. They bake their bread daily and everyone agreed that the bread makes the sandwhich. Recommended for sure!

It's close, clean, delicious, and open until 10pm! That's 5 stars in my book. I love all things peanut butter and chocolate, so when the guy working suggested peanut butter Oreo, why not? I now have a new favorite dessert! Thanks, guy. They also have a lot of other flavors, some made with milk and some with water. You can try as many as you'd like, which my stepdaughter gladly did even after she had her bowl filled and clearly wasn't buying any more. We will be back. :-)

Okay so I've never really been a fan of Popeye's. I tried one in Vegas and another connected to a gas station. Blech! But this one changed my opinion. The spicy chicken was delicious and the mashed potatoes with gravy (with jalapeños in it!!)! So good. The Mac and cheese had no flavor, the mashed potatoes made up for it for sure. This Popeyes is a keeper!

Macy's, Nordstrom's, The Apple Store, and Sephora! I love this mall. Clean, pretty, gigantic, and all my favorite stores. Let me tell you, I HATE mall shopping... But this one is my favorite if I have to go. There is a movie theater, valet parking (I thought this was such a crazy thing at a mall, lol), and restaurants galore. I love the fountains and outdoor seating.

Harkins is my go to theater, especially for matinees. Their popcorn is always delicious, the seats are comfortable, and they always have a good selection of new movies with varying times. Coming from a state where Regal and AMC were my options, Harkis was a huge step up! The multiple popcorn flavorings were the first thing I noticed, lol, which are now all over. Parmesan garlic!?!? Yum. :-)

They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm ... Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general...

I love Chick-Fil-A... the spicy chicken sandwhiches, the lemonade, the soup, the brownies... So I am a bit biased due to it being one of my mom's favorite fast food joints and a special out of town treat growing up (we didn't have these in my home state of Washington!). There's just something about chicken, pickles, and mayo that works. :-)

I chose Firebirds as my birthday dinner. It's a bit spendy, but not the most expensive steakhouse in the area. I promptly signed up for the email club and even though I got the birthday coupon for $10 off the night before my birthday, it still read, "happy belated birthday." I gave it to the waitress and told her it's actually my birthday today, but she still kept saying "belated birthday" lol. So as for the experience and the food... We went without a reservation and got a table as a party of two in less than 5 minutes. It's dimly lit and looks to be more of a casual dress place. The panella bread with butter was delicious! Sure, it's not the soft rolls with honey butter from another steakhouse (my husband likes those better), but I think it's just as tasty! My prime rib was soooo good and the au jus was salted perfectly. I opted for a baked potato and sautéed spinach as my sides.  The prime rib comes with a potato already, but it's $6 for any additional side. I probably had enough to eat, but really wanted a vegetable (even if it was coated in oil and topped with cheese). The food and service were great and I even learned of a food I've never tried. Jicama. We thought they were onions and picked them out of the salad lol.

This location was a Groupon find... Won't be back. The girl behind the counter was nice but even though I had the groupon right in front of me, she had to read it several times and I had to explain to her what I was supposed to be getting with it. The red light therapy is a nice idea... But the room the bed was in was lacking. They should hire an exterminator, not leave sticky bug traps down with dead bugs all over the floor where people generally have bare feet... Yuck!!

This is my Walgreens of choice based on their location, hours, and pharmacy. It's nearby and they are open 24 hours. The pharmacists have always been helpful and they have yet to mess up my prescriptions (other Walgreens in the area have given me nothing but problems when it comes to generics and billing). The only thing that creeps me out a bit about this location is the employee who is always picking ice off the freezer items.. and eating it! LOL, I don't come for the food anyway so it's quite alright if not amusing. :-)

I'll be back.

It's a busy place. The line was long, but went fairly quick. Seating is limited and it was loud. I can let that go though as it was lunch hour in a rather large plaza.    The sweet pork tacos were what I went with because all the tips pointed me there and, well, that's what I went to try!  They were good, but the chicken tacos were so much better! I prefer salt and spice over sweet though, so choose accordingly. The salsa was full of flavor and the tortillas are handmade right in front of you! The chicken is grilled behind the counter... Looked like it might be dry, but it most definitely was not. And the rice... Cilantro lime rice. Honestly, I didn't taste the lime, but it was great anyhow.   Delicious! I was afraid to admit that I found this place on Yelp (my bf threatened to ban me from Yelp after two disappointing picks, lol). Even he was satisfied with this one! :-)

Amazing dessert selection and freshly made sushi! I love the selection of items you can't find anywhere else. However, things like milk and cereal or any other everyday items are way overpriced. I'll still to larger chains for those, but AJ's is my go to for bringing something unique or special to the table. Love it!

I'm in love with Crackers & Co. I've only been there a couple times, but I can't wait to go back! This particular location gets a star knocked off for management. Maybe it was early in the morning before a holiday rush, or whatever the excuse, but another group was treated so awful over their reservation. However, once inside everything seemed to run smoothly. Service was great and so was my omelette. :-)

I had high hopes for this place.. Great price for all you can eat crab! Unfortunately, families were swiping plates of it as soon as it came out. They were kind enough to leave a few scrawny, soggy legs for those of us who are not greedy vultures and trying to enjoy our meals. It pains me to say this, but out of an entire buffet, I mostly enjoyed the sticky buns (sweet rolls similar to donuts). I tried a little of almost everything too. Okay... And the bathrooms? Disgusting. I am glad I didn't go in there before I ate. Their saving grace was that the server was nice and seemed to know the regulars. She did take a long time to get our drinks and never explained anything to us newbies to their buffet. BUT she was nice lol. I won't be back.

This is usually my take out place of choice. It's quick, inexpensive, close, and delicious. I usually get the shrimp lo mein. Now I'll be honest, there are so many white and green onions that I smell like an onion for hours! But I still get it, it's so tasty! :-)  It's a little too crowded and noisey for me to want to stay and eat if it's after 3pm. The fact that it is crowded is a good thing and says people like to eat their food, however, it's cramped and things are always being dropped and people are always pushing past your table.

I have not eaten here recently, but I'd like to throw my two cents in as to why. I used to love the Elephant Bar when I first moved to AZ.  The atmosphere is cool and they had some special lobster sauce. But after my initial two times, the food was terrible. I took my mom, stepdad, and little siblings there... They were not impressed. Then I took my dad and stepmom there... Again, not impressed. Furthermore, I had been raving and even my food was terrible. The fried food was so dark and greasy that even the kids wouldn't eat it. The sauces were different both times. It took forever for the food to come out. Their only saving grace was the coconut shrimp... Which quite honestly, is no better than the frozen costco version so not enough of a save to bring me back... Ever.

This is your typical McDonald's fare in a food court setting. It was definitely the least expensive meal of the weekend and I was happy to see that they have normal McDonalds prices, including the dollar menu (a lot of touristy places do not).  The line moved quickly and my order was correct. No complaints here!

It's expensive for a gym, but the amenities and hours make it well worth it. I have yet to try the salon, spa or cafe, but the gym, pool, basketball courts, and locker rooms have gotten significant use from my family. There are membership included classes as well as paid group classes offered. Personal training is offered and while they bombard you with emails and specials, I haven't been pressured by anybody while working out which is super nice! I hated that about other gyms. As for their personal training, it's super expensive, but worth it when you can get a good deal. Honestly there is so much to do there, you could make a day of the gym lol.

I am not a huge pizza fan, but I trust the opinion of my dad and husband in that it's "meh" and okay. That's my reason for docking one star.. It is after all Callifornia PIZZA kitchen, lol. I do love their Italian chopped salad though, which is the only thing I've ever ordered there since I found it.  Actually it'd been years since I went there and just had it twice this week. Yum! I also discovered their new Fresh Strawberry Mango cooler. I will choose a place to eat based on the drinks alone... For example, I'll opt out of places with Coke products for a place with Pepsi, even if the coke place has slightly better food. Anyway back to my review... The server was kind and quick enough. The food was good and timely. CPK is pretty consistent as a chain and I'll be back.

I'll go when I'm craving seafood... But it's really not good seafood. Everything is in some kind of butter sauce or deep fried. It smells fishy as soon as you walk in the door. The crowd is generally elderly folks and it's just a blah place. Shrimp Fest is the only time worth going... All you can eat for a great price!

I'm still breaking in my sushi palate, but I'll still review the place as I see it. Happy hour specials make my addiction to their tempura shrimp a little easier on the wallet! Service can be a little slow and music a little loud, not just during peak hours either. Other than that, the food is delicious! So far I've only tasted the California roll.. Once I broaden my horizons, I'll update my review. Mmm...

Huge slices for the price, that's about the best I can say. The atmosphere was nice enough for a small place, however, since I ordered ahead for take out I am reviewing based on my food. Let's start with the garlic knots. After reading other reviews, I guess I was supposed to microwave them per instructions on the box? Mine came in a styrofoam container in a brown paper bag and I didn't know (no instructions for me), so to my disappointment, they were cold. Yuck! Now for the pizza, it was just okay. Thank goodness our stomachs were growling and neither one of us had breakfast! When asked if the new place was a thumbs up or down, my boyfriend replied, "Meh, I've had better. But I've had worse too." The ham looked like cut up sandwhich ham that was bunched up across the pizza. Also, the crust was tough towards the outside and it was lacking in sauce. I was hoping for better based on the Yelp reviews and given our usual go to pizza place is no longer right down the street. I'll keep looking.

I found this place on Yelp through the check-in deals. I'm so happy I did. I have had a couple therapists and though their styles of massage very different, all were very good. I have been other places, but never felt so comfortable. It's clean, quiet, and welcoming environment made it my top choice when deciding what to do for my birthday. They have fresh strawberry infused ice water in the lounge area while you wait. There are organic products to look at and sample and magazines to browse if you are early for your appointment. Also, they were very accomodating for last minute appointments. I have never had any booking issues as I have with other places. Outstanding customer service and massages!

This Dairy Queen could get 5 stars for their blizzards and staying open late! Unfortunately, find my picture and see that I'm reviewing the food and wait time. It was a 15-20 minute wait for two chicken strip baskets. The one pictured was my 4 piece (count them, only 3!). Not to mention, they were more like nuggets, measuring just a few inches long. Now, this is not the DQ norm and I was embarrassed because I assured somebody that they actually have good fast food, not just soft serve. Lol. Fail!

I've been to a couple Massage Envy locations and have never been satisfied. I wanted to like this one because of the good reviews and it was recommended to me, but I just didn't. I have a massage place i am very satisfied with, but Massage Envy was running a pretty decent Valentine's Day special.  There were two of us, and both of us said ... The massage therapist was nice, but the massages were mediocre. Why ask where to focus if you're just going to brush over the areas? Also, the hour massage includes 10 minutes for changing, so don't expect a full hour. Maybe I've become spoiled by another place, but I was disappointed with the comfort of the beds (sheets not soft at all, no arm rests, and no heated beds!). I was cold the entire hour and each time new lotion was applied, it was freezing and I got goose bumps all over again. Unless you are a member, expect to pay $78 plus a tip for an hour massage. For $20 less, I'll stick with a much cozier and more effective massage place. Thanks anyway. Two stars are given because compared to other Massage Envy locations, the rooms were quiet. For once, I couldn't hear people walking, talking, and doors closing the whole hour.

I used to live down the street and had been on the lookout for a good mechanic. An elderly couple swore by Bob's shop and since I was tired of getting impersonal, overpriced, and incomplete service from the Chevy dealership, I made an appointment at Sunland. I haven't looked back! Sunland is such a reliable, honest, and complete shop that I go there still even though I have moved to Chandler.

I'm not a huge pizza fanatic, but this location was my go to on pizza nights. I was sad to drive by and see they were replaced by a sub shop! :-(

I originally signed up with another glass company to replace my windshield. Two days in a row they didn't show up AND couldn't find me in their system. I called Blue Chip (formerly Gorilla Auto Glass) because I had a cash back coupon and they had great reviews. They came out the very same day and I got a check from them within two weeks. Quick, friendly, and quality work!!! :-)   P.S. This review is a few years old, but was removed because the company changed their name. I'm just putting it back up because they should get all the reviews they earned.

The burgers... Taste like real beef and not fillers! Delicious! The fries weren't my favorite part of the meal. I had the Cajun, which I'm sure were more flavorful than the regular... But still nothing to write home about. They make up for it with the tasty burgers and drinks. Who doesn't love any place with a Coke Freestyle machine?! :-) I'll definitely be back.

I wish I could give this family ran franchise more stars. They get two for being on time, early even. Also, they were nice enough people. I found it odd that when it came time to install, it was a family affair and their daughter (I'm assuming) came with and followed from room to room. But hey, it's a family business so okay. What I don't like about my purchase is the actual blinds. They are very cheap for the price I paid. It's been less than a year and the end caps have been falling off so often they finally just got stepped on or "hmm wonder what this random piece of plastic is" and thrown away. The trash from when they installed them was left behind and shows where they ordered the blinds and I'll make sure future companies I do business with do not bulk purchase from the same place.

Okay, so I use to live on a reservation in Washington state. The tribe could smoke a mean salmon, but the local frybread joint left me not a big fan. However, thanks to Groupon and other Yelp reviewers, I got a taste for some. I'm glad I did because this place changed my overall opinion.   Pros: For being frybread, it was not greasy at all. There is a variety of choices from vegetarian to desserts. Here is what members of our group had - BBQ beef and cheese frybread, two red chile frybread tacos, a side salad, and sweet frybread with honey and powdered sugar. YUM!  Cons: The new location is in a rundown area and located next to a liquor store. Plastic utensils just don't cut it here. I ended up tearing my food apart.  Also, nobody acknowledged us when we came in and sat down. We weren't sure if someone would take our order or if we had to go to the counter because we hadn't been there before.    As long as you go in not expecting anything fancy and over the top, you won't be disappointed. It's a family owned restaurant with faithful customers (we were greeted by one when we accidentally went to their old location). All four of us left full and satisfied with our meals.

I had heard stories about hour long waits, but that was not the case for us on a rainy Saturday morning. The regular line looked to be fairly short, but since we filled out the info online, our line was non-existent! There was a couple at the window, then it was our turn. Bring cash to avoid the debit card fee.  There are hustlers outside, trying to lure you to their chapels. If you are on a whim and don't have one picked out yet, I guess you could score a deal! Otherwise, just let them know you have a place already and they back down.   As for parking, there is paid parking on the street. We dropped in two quarters just to be on the safe side... They watch and the fine is $20, so don't cheap out on that quarter! Lol. :-)

I have been going to this dentist for a few years now and have been very satisfied. I chose Dr. Higgs by his name, lol, don't ask. I'm so glad I did. They have state of the art equipment and great customer service skills! On my first visit, I was taken on a tour of the office and was quite impressed. The dental assistants have always done a great job and are friendly (oh, and they have amazing teeth as well, lol). The nicest touch about Dr. Higgs is that he calls patients at home the night after any procedure. This is just a nice place to go and even though I no longer live in the Chandler area, I will go out of my way for a good dentist.

The decor could use some updating, but it's a cozy little place. They have a couple old school video games and some little league sponsor pics on the wall. I do love that they support local causes.  The sandwiches are filling. The bread is fresh.  Any sandwich place that has sprouts is a winner in my book! It's nearby and way better than subway. I'll be back.

Great new find! I saw The Amazing Spider-Man here in 3D and in the DBox seats. The only downfall was that their popcorn was disgusting. It seemed stale and burnt at the same time. There is a cafe and full bar as well as many lounge areas inside and out. You can have a dressy date or a casual night at the movies here. I love the versatility. Now, the DBox seats have me hooked! For action movies, they are so fun and I will definitely be back, haha. The guy next to me laughed every time they kicked on, lol, and I giggled some too. My bf had a huge grin on his face as well so I'm guessing two thumbs up from him! I'll be back next time there is a superhero movie for sure.   There are also other screens here which offer $8 tickets. You get reserved seating and food is served throughout the movie. Sounds distracting, but maybe I'll give it a chance at some point.

Maybe their dogs are better, but breakfast sandwiches at Nathan's are disgusting! The English muffin was spongy, the eggs greasy, the bacon undercooked... And all premade and wrapped ready to melt together into mush with the cheese. Yuck!!!

I heard about this store after purchasing a Groupon. The website really piqued my interest and I had high hopes of a "country market" type store with local produce and fresh products. Initially, I giggled to myself when parking because of the cute little building and gravel parking... I felt like I was in Idaho! And then, I went inside. :-/. Okay so the store had only been open a short time, but it looked like a ton of customers had sampled the tester salsa bowls (with the lack of customers, one would have to assume that they were not all that fresh). Gross!!!  There were some tasty looking bottles of Olive Oils and other local items, but nothing you can't get at the farmer's market at a lower price. The worst part was out back, the nursery and picnic area. I do not want to support a place with animals (a goat, a sheep, and 2 chickens) wading around in mud, standing water, and their own poo! Hopefully the hot 100 degree weather will help with the water issue... But without access to any shade, I doubt the animals would hope for the same. Thank goodness Groupon was understanding of my lack of interest in making any purchases here. They refunded my account in no time.

This place is great! I have somewhere a little closer to me that I usually go to for convenience, but I think I'll stop being lazy and make this my regular. They are clean and have really nice chairs. The employees are always so kind... "Your skin is like baby's." is always something a woman wants to hear lol. Points for you! And the massage and hot stones with the pedicure?! Yeah, since I usually just do my own nails, I opted for this one. Sigh.... :-)  The owner was there on this day and was waxing eyebrows like crazy. I mean, the place is in a bad location and they never seem to have a lot of customers. There were several people who came in and gave her so much praise about how she always does so well... So when my nails were done, I asked her to clean me up too. Very nice. She didn't get any in my hair, lol, yes that happens where I usually go... And they looked great! Oh... And no greasy cooling lotion to wash off when I get home.   I'll be back on the regular now. And you should go give them business too!!!

I'm SO relieved to get my claws back in order. I've been so rough on them after just painting and moving into a new house. They are nails once again.  This place recommended the perfect color for me and walked me through my first ever gel experience! Yes, I know I'm a bit behind the craze, but I generally just cut them short and throw the color of the week on, lol. I guess 45 minutes isn't enough time to get both my fingers and toes done separately, but they asked if I minded a technician working on my fingers and toes at the same time. Of course not... I am not one to be pampered for long without getting antsy, so that was perfect for me.  Anyhow, my nails look great and I'll definitely be back. Not that I don't love my old place, but I wanted somewhere a bit closer after my move. Thanks, Yelpers, for coming through once again!

Coming from the Seattle area where there are teriyaki stops on every corner, I've been on the lookout for a fast food teriyaki place nearby. This comes close... What would make it better? Delivery and not a franchise lol. The teriyaki chicken is delicious and comes with the right sides of salad and white rice. The yakisoba is so good as well. The only thing I've had there so far that I'd advise you to skip... The tempura shrimp. Absolutely tasteless. Otherwise, it's a go!

Just an update... I tried their chicken teriyaki and it's just how it should be! Char grilled chicken, just enough rice, and the sauce was delicious! They still get 4 stars!   However, I took California rolls to go and ate one at home later. My lips began to swell and tingle and my tongue too! I've never had an allergic reaction to a California roll in my life... So idk what it was in there, but I had to throw the rest of the order away. :-/

The first time I went here, I was not impressed. I ordered my usual breakfast... Bacon, eggs over easy, and hash browns. The eggs were way over cooked and the hash browns were burnt.   That experience aside, it's close, so I checked it out again. The castroville omelette is my go to at The Good Egg. Soooo good! Spinach, mushrooms, onion, tomato, artichoke hearts, and jack cheese. Get it!   They are open from 6:30am - 2:30pm. It's generally chilly inside, so bring a sweater unless you like cooler temps.

They have never once gotten my order right at this KFC. There is always sauce when I ask for none on a sandwich, the wrong dipping sauce for my strips, etc. Okay, maybe they did get my order correct once... But it was awful! Check out the pictures to see what I'm referring to.

Blech. How can you mess up a turkey dog? I could've nuked mine at home and it would've tasted better than this. I won't be back. Also, I ordered a meal in the drive through and they forgot the fries.

The prices are comparable to all the other area car washes. They are close and they do a great job. I especially love the turtles out back, though they probably need a bigger swimming area since there are so many. There was no wait at all.. In and out and finally have a clean car! No complaints. :-)

Meh. Two stars for arriving on time, initial friendliness, and speedy job. Minus 3 stars for the lack of bothering to screw the vents back in thoroughly, the hard upsell, and the short temperament after I declined more services. Yes, there is more dust beyond the reach of your vacuum (which is why I hired someone to clean them in the first place). Yes, I know the dryer vent is dirty... And the groupon says for an extra fee, you will unclog it, but apparently not because the vent exits the house on the roof. Sigh... Like so many dryer vents!   Lol. Had I paid more, I wouldn't be LOLing, but he told me my house was probably 30 years old (not even since it was built in 1995) and had never ever had the AC filter changed. It was not even as dirty as the filter in my apartment gets in a month. He vacuumed out my vents at least from a strong van mounted system. Idk what more I expected for the price of the Groupon... But I'll pass on that next time.

I had this place bookmarked for months before I finally made it. The place was packed and lines were long, which means it must be worth the wait! I felt a little rushed through the ordering process, but they made it work and it was definitely fast service, which was great because I was on a break from a class across the street. Oh yeah, the seating arrangement was a pain though! The place is huge but not big enough for everyone to sit down, causing people to turn to seat vultures, eyeballing you to hurry it up with your meal they don't have to stand there anymore.  Now the food... It was delicious! I had an Italian beef (dipped plus hot peppers) and a bottle of water. My co-worker was kind enough to share her fries with cheese sauce and I only had a few, but let me be honest in saying I could make a meal out of those! Yum. So, I would be back for the fries alone.  Let me tell you why the two stars and why only the cheese fries would get my business. I was soooo sick to my stomach the rest of the day. I could feel the grease from the "gravy" sitting in my stomach and was belching the taste through the next day. This is not normal for me and so disgusting! Like I said earlier, it was delicious, however, after that bout I am too scared to give the sandwich another shot.

My first experience had me less than thrilled... I am not a fan of the egg fried rice. Also, the garlic shrimp I had been looking forward to looked nothing like the picture. Well, another night I had a craving for takeout and my husband suggested we try them again. I'm so glad we did! My teriyaki chicken, rice, and miso soup were very good. I like that they use thighs for the teriyaki chicken, but some may not... My husband said it tasted weird lol. I actually liked his order of sesame chicken more. The miso soup was delicious and will be remembered next time I'm under the weather.   It's a small, family owned place so don't expect a huge restaurant. However, it's quiet, cozy, and they also have takeout or delivery ($2) if you're not feeling the environment.

Meh... When faced with Fired Pie or the many other new "build your own pizza" joints out there, even their "Pookie" can't save them. I gave them a fair shot, but the minimal pre cooked and sad looking toppings, tasteless crust, and tiny expensive cookie didn't get high marks in my book. I try and not rate my restaurants by comparing to others, so even as a standalone place... I didn't like the food and won't be back. Customer service was good and the place was clean, so they can have a couple of stars.

Quick and friendly service at the drive thru. The chicken fingers are huge, more like strips, and fresh chicken breast meat. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.   The only good part of my meal was the coleslaw, which is usually my afterthought and gets thrown out. The chicken was tasteless, as were the fries and watered down lemonade. The sauce? While I understand it's a hit, I HATE ketchup ... The sauce is mostly ketchup, mayo, and pepper ... Yes, I know there are other ingredients. BUT they really should offer alternative sauces since the food is so bland by itself.   I'd like to say I'll try something else next time, but just like no other sauces, they have no other food either lol.

The mesquite smell as soon as you enter is so enticing! I loved my carne asada quesadilla and the salsa bar had so many options. I love that you can choose between canned US Fanta or bottled real sugar Fanta... Nice touch. :-) It was not very busy, but the weather was pretty bad, so hopefully that was the reason and this little local joint gets enough business to stick around.

Drive thru salads made to order... what's not to like?! I've only been here once, but I can't wait to try more combinations. The salads are $7+ but they are huge and I could easily get two meals out of one. They also have some unique drink options (blueberry rosemary lemonade), sandwiches, wraps, and smoothies. I'll be back for sure.

Five stars! I don't even like pizza much, but you can get white sauce or pesto (I got both). So basically it was a thin crust garlic bread with cheese and veggies. I think of it as a subway of pizza. You pick your sauce, veggies, meat, cheese... And they wood fire it for you in no time! They only have thin crust, so that's the only thing you can't personalize on your personal pizza, by that helps with how quickly they can serve you. It was thumbs up from everyone in my family, so we'll be back.

Don't let the boring name or dark decor scare you away! We were actually going to the sandwich shop next door, but they were having their floor cleaned. The guy cleaning the floor came out as we were deciding where to go instead and suggested this place.   The menu didn't seem to appeal to my family, so we all reluctantly ordered a safe choice of a cheeseburger. Oh my... I have been craving their burger since we walked out! They use grass fed beef from Iowa, part chuck and part brisket and you can order it cooked medium or even rare if that's how you like it! I may have to do medium well next time as the medium rare was a bit too red and juicy and my bottom bun got soggy. But seriously, is a juicy burger something to complain about? I'll be back next time I have a hankering for some red meat.   Thanks Sidewinders for cleaning your floors! (Don't worry, we will still patronize your establishment for sandwiches).

I love this place! They get four stars only because they charge an extra $1 if you aren't paying with cash. Oh yeah, and you can't add the tip to the card!? Craziness. So as long as you remember to go to the ATM first, this place is awesome. Clean, nice massaging pedicure chairs, and super nice staff! I showed up just as they were closing and they still rushed me back to get my eyebrows done. Hooray! They needed it, lol. And even though they were closing, the girl didn't do a rush job, and topped it off with their standard temple and neck rub to boot. Thanks so much!

Not all Starbucks' are equal. This one is brand new, spacious, has a drive through, and is open until 9:30pm. No complaints here! The baristas are super friendly and helpful to a late-blooming coffee lover. :-)
