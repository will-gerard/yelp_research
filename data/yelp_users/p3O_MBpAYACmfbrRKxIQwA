Ordered a large garlic, fresh basil, and fresh sliced tomato pizza asked for it crispy. A Cesar salad, and an order of hot wings last night. After all of the fees added up it was around $40, after waiting for an hour we called to find out where the food was, and the employee barked at us that the driver was on his way. The driver finally showed up after 2 hours with a cold pizza, cold wings, and warm salad. The extra ranch and hot sauce we were charged for wasn't there,The pizza was soggy had no garlic or basil, the box was soaked in grease and the wings were dry and burnt to a crisp. The driver almost dropped our entire order as walking up to the door, he also had an attitude and didn't keep the food in a delivery hot bag.  If your looking for cheap food when your drunk, get a cab and go somewhere else or even get a frozen pizza, that at least won't give you food poisoning the next day.

As a hole in the wall restaurant, this place offers some of the best food in the valley, great pricing, and great flavor! If your a fan of Spicy try ordering your food "Thai Hot" but be sure to get some green tea ice cream afterwards because your mouth WILL be burning! Over all amazing experience, the food is incredible, drunken noodles, or garlic noodles are a must.
