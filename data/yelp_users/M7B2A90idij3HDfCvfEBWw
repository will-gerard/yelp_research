Apollo's is like a neighborhood gay bar.  It's small and has a patio for smoking.  the parking lot is bigger than the bar...lol.  Come on Mondays from Drag bingo.  That's right, it's bingo hosted by a drag queen.  The game itself is naughty with perverted bingo games and adult prizes for winning.  Mondays are also two for one, so see Hannah behind the bar and she'll take care of you.  Also, Apollo's is fun on Sundays for their various drag shows and strippers afterwards.

Rainbow Cleaners has become my new dry cleaner.  I tried them out because they are close to work, and decently priced.  I quickly found out that they do a great job and the service is friendly.  This business is also family owned, which is a plus in my book.  Rainbow also has a taylor on site to help with buttons, hems and such.  They can tackle items that require special care too.  I have a few shirts with suede designs on them and the team is always able to follow the instructions on the garment so that it comes out looking great.  If you're needing a new cleaner, check out Rianbow Cleaners.  Rainbow Cleaners accepts Visa and Mastercard too, which is nice.  My old dry cleaners wanted cash, which was sometimes a pain.

Duck and Decanter "the Duck" is freaking awesome!  I like the store like atmosphere and the friendly staff.  Aside from fabulous sandwiches and sides they have lots of other great stuff too.  They have unique dishes, gormet foods and sodas.  The Duck also have a large wine room and beer selection.    They can get busy during lunch, but the staff are very friendly, and quick!  This is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait!

Houston's is one of my fav's.  I think the part I like the most, is that they do not allow cell phones in thier dining room...according to the bottom of the menus anyway.    I have never had a bad meal here, and the service is really good too.  The bar is a bit crowed after work, but the drinks are good.  Parking can be interesting if you don't like to valet (I don't), as the garage can fill up quickly.  If you like steak, ribs or burgers, head over to Houston's.

I get my hair cut at Salon Surreal.  I've been going for a while now and I love it.  Each time I go, Lauren, who's at the front desk knows me by name and makes me feel welcome.  Bobby cuts my hair and does a great job each time!  He always makes sure that I like when he's done and gives the greatest washes ever!  he also styles it when I leave.  :-)  The salon is clean and bright and full of color. There are usually cookies and beverages available too.  Aside from hair, Salon Surreal also offers nail services, massages, and waxing.  Salon Surreal is great because it's casual and offers great services at decent prices.  Go and treat yourself!  Also, walk ins are welcome.

One of my favorites!!  Houston's is always consistent with great food and wonderful service.  Definitely make a reservation as the place is always busy.  My favorite is the Hawaiian Ribeye!

Nordstrom Rack is my go-to spot! I love the Rack! Designer clothing, discounted...retail heaven.   I have gotten great deals here on jeans, shoes, and shirts.   The Rack is usually well organized and you won't have to worry about clothes being stained or ripped like you might at Ross or Marshall's.   I have been to both of the Rack's in the valley, and I like this one the best. They have a great selection, and friendly staff.   The line can get a little long on the weekends, but this is definitely a great place to find great pieces to complete your wardrobe!  Also, The Rack accepts Nordstrom gift cards, credit cards, and points.

Charlie's is not my favorite place, but I go a lot because I have a ton of friends who like to go.  There is something going on at Charlie's.  Whether it be strippers on Monday nights or Pussy LeHoot and friends on Sunday.    The bartenders pour a strong beverage, so be ready!  Drinks are three for one on Sunday afternoons, and two for one on Thursday evenings.  There are three other Charlie's locations too.  Las Vegas, Denver, and Chicago.  I have also been to Charlie's Denver.  I believe that Phoenix has the biggest one of the four.  Huge dance floor, plenty of space inside. Out back the patio is colossal! There is a volleyball court back there too!  One of my favorite things about Charlie's is the taco stand!  They have the best tacos and burritos ever!  Tacos are small and only a buck each...perfect for a snack.  the burrito is five bucks and worth it!  You can get food inside the back patio or directly from Camelback.  I recommend coming on a Sunday night.  Have a taco or burrito and see Pussy LeHoot!

Okay, so I have a little bit of bias towards Nordstrom.  I freaking love Nordstrom!    The store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly.  I have never had such good service anywhere else.  I especially love that Nordstrom will return or exchange an item with no questions asked.  Aside from the service, the selection is very nice.  I always go during the half yearly sale, so that I can get some good deals on my designer duds!  I am big on shoes and the selection is very good.  They always have some cool shoes that I can't seem to live without.  Also, the staff in the shoe department are very good on helping to make suggestions when I am not sure what I want.  If you go, go in June or  January when the sales are great!  Make sure you check out the shoes!

So, I was introduced to Pasta Brioni about two years ago by one of my best friends and her sister.  We trying to decide where to eat, and they we're like "Let's go to Pasta Brioni because the servers are sooooo hot!"  So we went, and yes the server was very good looking.  The girls were pleased.  Aside from the staff, the food has been good every time I have been there.  I always get the four cheese rigatoni, and it is very good.  If you go...get the crab cakes as a starter.  Go for the food, the "soooo hot" staff that I have heard about has been hit or miss.

Tempe Mission Palms is a great hotel.  The prices are not too bad, and it is in downtown Tempe.  ASU is right next to the hotel.    It can a little noisy if your room is at the front of the hotel, as it will most likely face the clubs the are on two sides.    There are shops are restaurants with walking distance which is really nice.    They have a great breakfast too, which perfect after a good night on Mill Avenue.

Okay, so I'm a mall person.  I come from a family of born shoppers, and all of my frineds are shoppers too.  My boyfriend...he is not a shopper, which is nice, b/c one of has to save.  Scottsdale Fashion Square is pretty close to retail heaven, in AZ.  I love upsacle malls, and have been to South Coast Plaza (Santa Ana, CA), Cherry Creek Mall (Denver, CO), and The Galleria (Dallas, TX).   At Fashion Sqaure, one can find all the luxuary essentails: Burberry, Chanel (via Neiman Marcus), Cartier, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Carolina Herrera, Tiffany, Jimmy Choo, and more.  there are also department stores like Nordstom, Neiman Marcus, Dillard's and Macy's.  Comming soon: Barney's New York!  Can I get a Wahoo?  Aside from luxury and botique stores, Fashion Square has all the regulars we all love, like Express, Gap, Aldo, Abercrombie and Fitch, etc.  So, when you're in the Phoenix area and need to shop, get yourself down to Fashion Square in Scottsdale.

Any place that serves the full menu until 2 a.m. is awesome!  Aside from food till 2 a.m. (that's every night by the way), the food is fabulous.  So are the drinks.  I'll admit that I've only ever had the burgers, but damn they're good.  This place is on the pricey side...but who can put a price on a great burger?  Also, they have a to-go side too!  Make sure to try the red velvet cup cakes, if you still have room after the burger.

Padre's is a nice little Mexican place that has it's own spin on Mexican food.  It's not the standard fare that you will encounter at Macayo's or Manuel's.  Fresh food and a great menu. The entrees are delicious.  I like the Padre's is a small place that has it's own charm.  There is a big bar area and dining as well.  I won't write too much more, so you'll be able to experience Padre's for yourself.  Enjoy!

So, I finally ate at the Maggiano's that is in the city I live in.  Previously, I had only enjoyed the take out from this location, but had never eaten inside.  When I was in Denver, I ate at the one in downtown.  The Scottsdale Maggiano's did not disappoint!  I reciecved the same wonderful service as I did in Denver, and my meal was great too!  Now, please be advised that you can order half portions or full portions.  Half portions seem to be more then enought for most people.  Now...if your cooking skill is like mine (I make really fabulous reservations, but not much else) you may want to opt for the full portion, so you'll have left overs.  YUM!!!!  Great service and great food!  Maggiano's is alway consistant...no surprises!  Go and enjoy!

Visted The Vig yesterday for the first time.  I dined with a friend who is very fond of the place.  We were seated quickly, and our drinks were good.  I had chicken fingers from the kid's menu and she had a salad.  The food was good.  The place was nice...rather trendy.  Full of people as the Suns game was on.  Over all a great experience.  I'm sure I'll go back soon.

So, I now frequent The Vig.  If you go, talk to Jason, the bartender.  He's quick with the beverages and funny.  Enjoy yourself.  You deserve it!  This place can get packed during dinner hour, though.

Stopped in this evening because we had never been. Good carne asada tacos. The corn has a cheese rub on it that I had never had before. It was very unique and different. Great prices too. If you're on the mood for some tacos, stop in.  Parking is rather limited though.

I have been wearing glasses since I was eight months old...it's been a long time.  For several years now, I have been going to LensCrafters for my frames and lenses.    This location (at City North) is the newest one in the valley.  I was in yesterday to get my glasses adjusted.  the store was immaculent and the staff were friendly, curtious, and helpful.  They were both smiling and they let me look around with out coming over to bug me.  I ended up buying some sunglasses while I was there.  I have not had prescription sunglasses in a long time.  Everything was clearly explained to me during the entire process.  They even hooked me up with a discount that I did not even know I could get.  Overall, this was one of the best experiences I have ever had buying glasses.  However, not all LensCrafters are the same.  I don't live close to this location, I was just in the area, but for great service I'm willing to travel.  if you need glasses, go see the staff at this LensCrafters!

A fun eatery in uptown Phoenix!  Hula has great happy hour, dinner and brunch!  I'm a fan of the tacos and the two egg breakfast.   I don't think I've ever been here without a group of people, so I've always had either a Scorpion or Volcano bowl.  Both are super strong and have 151 in the middle.  Bring your friends!

The bf got his truck washed here and raved about it!  He got an oil change, car wash, and leather treatment for his car.  It did look amazing when I saw it right after the wash.  I was impressed.  So, I went this past Friday to get my car washed. I got "The Works" car wash.  I will say that the outside of my car did look fabulous when it was done.  Here's where they went wrong:  First, IU was informed that my car was not shiny like it is supposed to be.  The guy compared my car to a freshly waxed black car.  Of course my silver car isn't going to look the same as a black car that just got waxed!  I was irritated to say the least.  Second: When my car was "finished" I went over and got in.  As I started the car, and pulled away from the drying area, I realized the dash of my car was dusty.  It had never been wiped down.  What car wash vacuums a car but doesn't wipe off the dash?  Looks like I'll be going back to Los Olivo's or Danny's for my future washes!

I've been to Modern Steak three times, for three different occasions.    The first time was for dinner.  I left rather unimpressed.  I felt that the steak was decent, and my bf's pasta dish was a little on the small side.  I was sold on the desserts though.  The second time was for happy hour.  Great apps and champagne is always a winner with me!  Definitely check on the happy hour.  Most recently, I stopped in for lunch with friends.  This was the best.  The patio was fabulous.  I had the mac n cheese which was perfect for lunch.  My friends had the hot dog and the burger, both of whom raved about their meals.  Stop in to Modern Steak if you you're hungry!  Go for the mac n cheese!

My grandmother was taken here, instead of the hospital emergency room.  The staff was polite and very kind.  The doctors and nurses explained everything and made sure that my grandmother recieved great care.  If you live in this area, I'd definitely go here before the hospital.

I was not impressed.  The atmosphere is alright, but nothing special. The service was alright, and our waitress seemed to be a little off.  She was unsure on what came with different entrees.  The pricing seems a little high for the area too.  I had Lobster Mac N Cheese and it was pretty good. I felt that there are other places I could have paid the same price and enjoyed myself more.

Halim took me here while we were shopping one day.  Delicious burgers and black cherry soda.  This is one of those green restaurants too, which is nice.   We both had burgers and had no complaints. Nice atmosphere, decent prices and good burgers.  If you're in the area check it out and enjoy!

I just had the front windows on my 2013 Lexus RX tinted, as the rear windows had tint, but the fronts did not.  Eric was prompt in responding to my inquiry via yelp and answered all of my questions.  He came to my office to install the tint which was a huge plus for me.  he had samples so I would know what the tint color looked like once installed as well.  My car looks great and Eric is awesome!  If you need tint, give Eclipse a shout!

I ask for a table and there are 8 of us. The hostess informs me that we cannot be seated. They cannot accommodate large groups.   I've never had a restaurant tell me that before. I expected to have to wait, but not to be told I couldn't be seated.  I'd give zero stars if I could.
