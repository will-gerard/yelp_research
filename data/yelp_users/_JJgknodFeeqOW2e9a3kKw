Went there for lunch and had a Chicken chopped salad.  There was not a lot of chicken and it was not cheap!  Everything is already made and it is re-heated after you order it.

They really make travel easy.  Not only is it cheaper to park at Pre-Flight than to park at the airport, it is also more convenient.  When you arrive, they give you a section to park in.  Within a matter of minutes a van picks you up from you car and a friendly drive loads your luggage into the van.  When you arrive at the airport, the same friendly driver take care of your bags again.  Upon returning, you go to the designated curb and a van is never more than 10 minutes away.  They take you right to your car and will even load your luggage into your trunk.  Excellent service!

Good little hole in the wall.  The tacos were very good.  I was surprised how spicy they actually were.  Also for as busy as they were at lunch, they got the food out to you pretty quick.

We had a wonderful family staycation.  I was impressed by the staff and the resort as a whole.  We had a great time at the waterpark and enjoyed our comfy suite.   The only negative is the outrageous prices for food at the waterpark.  Yes I do realize that they want to make money, but you should be able to at least bring in non-alcholic drinks and snacks.   We look forward to many return visits!

We really do love this place.  However depending on how busy the place is, your experience can vary.  Sometimes the staff just goes through the motions and they try to rush you.  Also kids eat free through labor day!

My daughter had her 6th birthday party here this past weekend and both my wife and I were so overly impressed by the entire party.  My daughter and all of her friends had such a wonderful time.  She is already planning to have her 7th birthday party here next year.   The entire staff treated my daughter and all of her friends like little princesses.  There were so many activities the time just flew by.  To sum things up, this is the best money that I have ever spent on a kids birthday party!

We went here since we had a Living Social deal expiring.  The service was pretty bad and half of my meal was cold.  They do offer all you can eat sushi for $20, but not even sure if it would be worth it.

For a taco shop, those were some pretty tasteless tacos!  I was so uninspired with what I was served that I did not even take a picture. My wife had fish tacos that were dry and also tasteless.

It has been several years since we went here.  My wife wanted sushi so the entire family decided to head on over for dinner.  They have happy hour until 6pm so that was an added bonus.  My wife ordered several sushi rolls and loved them all.  My son and I each ordered a combo meal.  The food was delicious!  We all enjoyed our meals.  The service was great too.  The only negative was they do not have a children's menu.

My wife wanted to do something special for Mother's Day.  So we took  the entire family on the dinner cruise aboard the Dolly Steamboat.  What a fabulous time we all had!  First off the scenic views on the drive to Canyon Lake were amazing.    Once we got to the dock we got our tickets and boarded the Dolly.  We took our seats up on the second deck and our wonderful 2 1/2 journey began.  The sites were amazing and and the music was very relaxing.    About an hour into the cruise dinner was served!  The caterers prepared a delicious champagne chicken and roast pork loin.  It was severed with salad, roasted veggies and the most amazing scalloped potatoes.    But the best part of the trip, was the crew.  Captain Jeff and his entire crew were all amazing.  They were all very friendly and very helpful.  We are looking forward to our next cruise on the Dolly Steamboat!

What a great place to have a fun dinner with the family.  Did not really know what to expect but I am so glad that we went.  The staff is so nice and the food is great.  It is served all you can eat family style.  You get Ham, chicken and ribs.  It also comes with bean, cole slaw, green beans and fresh bread as well as drinks and cookies for desert.  You eat off of metal plates with metal cups just like the miners did back in the day.  The kids loved it as much as we did.  There is a cute two man band that plays and keeps everyone happy.  Also I can not say enough about the staff.  They are all so friendly and helpful.  This is now our new spot to take out of town guests.

The food is over priced for the size of portion that is received.  Also no chips and salsa except on Friday and Saturday night.  But the worst thing is the owner.  He is such a rude jerk.  I have dined here for the last time.

A great place for the entire family to have fun!  IT is not the best food out there, but it does the job.  More importantly the kids love it and we always have a blast when we go.  We also love all of the different rooms that you can have dinner or a snack in.  We usually end up in the movie room.

The company needs to make some serious customer service improvements. I was shocked as to what took place this morning.   The driver showed up to my house early and when my wife told him that he was early and that I would be ready in five minutes, he yelled at her 545!  I came to the door three minutes later and he was gone. He then came screeching down my street another five minutes later came to my door and started yelling at me and said are you ready now!  I told him he was early, he yelled back no I was not. You can read my screen. He said this is my van and I can do what I want!  We then exchanged expletives as I told him to let go of my bags.   Darryl in van 608 is a menace and should not be working with customers.   So happily took an UBER to the airport.

Customer service does not get much worse than it is at this place.  After my wife spent over four hours working on a nice plate for our family, we found out that it was broken from others that attended the event at the studio.  She called to speak to the owner and after a week of not hearing back she finally got her on the phone.  The owner said that as a policy, she does not call customers back.  I am fine with that as we are no longer customers.

Whatever you want they have it.  All of the asian food that you can think of.  Fresh sushi, and mongolian bbq too if you are in the mood.  On the weekends they also have crab legs.  This place is well worth the price and wait (if there is one).

I am writing this review on behalf of my dog Rocky.  On a tip I went here to get some treats for my dog.  They have an entire freezer of items for dogs.  I picked up a big bone and some broken down ones as well.  The bones are smoked and I am guessing delicious .  My dog is in haven when I give him a new bone.   The next time I will also be picking up some treats for me behind the counter.

After reading all of the negative reviews, I felt that I had to submit a review based on all of the fun I had at Bounce U with my kids.  I purchased a Groupon and finally got around to using it this week.  I went with my two kids (4&2) to family open bounce on Wednesday (5pm-8pm).  We had a blast!  When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted by several staff members.  We signed in and gout right to bouncing.  After an hour we switched to a second room and the fun continued.  All of the staff members were very friendly and were playing and having a good time with all of the kids.

We love this place!  Great staff , excellent service and yummy food cooked right at your table.  This is a much better option than Benihana.  The chef's always put on a good show, and have lots of fun with the guests at the table.  Also if you like sushi, it is some of the best in the Valley!  Additionally they have a very generous happy hour everyday until 7pm.

My wife and I went to Mastro's City Hall for our 10 year anniversary.  We had never been here before, and we wanted to treat our self out to a nice dinner.  The service was excellent.  Just what you would expect.  On to the food.  The fresh bread that they bring to the table was delicious.  We started with the Tuna Tar Tar tower.  It is hit the mark.  Then it came time for the main event.  Of course we went with the lobster mash.  yes they lived up to the hype.  So delicious and filled with lots of lobster.    My wife has a wonderful bone-in rib eye steak.  It was cooker perfectly and tasted delicious.  I went for the chefs cut NY Strip.  To my disappointment it was cook well done and not medium.  The cooked a new one for me, but still missed the mark.  The steak was very charred and closer to rare than medium.  However I did not let this run my meal or the evening.  After dinner was over the wonderful waitress set our table for dessert.  We had not placed an order, but she severed us their famous Butter Cake.  It was simply delicious.  My wife agreed with the waitress that it was life changing.    While I was sad that my steak did not hit the mark, I was still very pleased with the evening.  Besides my was was extremely happy.  So happy wife, happy life.

I have been a fan and customer of Benihana for many years, which makes this review so sad to write.  I was totally unimpressed with our meal.  The chef at the table just went through the motions and it was nothing too special.  He under cooked my wife's shrimp and did not even cut my steak good.  There are better options available if you would like to dine out for Teppanyaki.  So Sad...

Pretty cool place.  The food was good and we all had a great time.  The kids loved making smores after dinner.  Be sure to bring your supplies.    I am glad that we went with others that had been there before as we would have been lost.  You do have to wait in a long line to place your order, but the food comes out pretty fast.  The one thing that bothered me was having people swarm over your table while you are still trying to enjoy your evening.

The food is great and the staff is friendly.  I love that you can eat peanuts and toss the shells too.    They have some great early bird specials served until 6pm, it is worth the price.  I am going to make more of an effort to dine here more frequently with my family.

Don't be alarmed if the restaurant looks empty, they do a ton of take out.  If you are in South Chandler and like Chinese food, you must dine here.

I have been here a few times, and had a good time.  However this last visit was a bit disappointing.  The acts were not as good as in the past.  On a positive note, there is no longer a two drink minimum.  Added after abuse from owner: I tried to keep things nice and offer some constructive criticism.  But the owner Howard is too much of a baby to even see that.  So if you want to see an ego manic owner try and do stand up comedy, this is the place to go.  Otherwise, check out one of the other comedy clubs in the Phoenix area.

Went to DC Steak House for dinner with my family on a Sunday night.  This place was packed!  I am glad that I had a reservation as people were being turned away.  Getting seated was a bit of an issue.  Two parties that came in after us were seated before us.  I had to speak to the hostess to ensure we got seated.  The food was great we all enjoyed our meals.  What I did not enjoy was a lot of additional charges.  I did not find out the "small charge" until the bill arrived and no substitutions are allowed.  So if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a vegetable.  Even though they are the same price on the menu  These extra charges increased my daughters meal almost 50% and this is not acceptable.  The food was good but the service issues may prevent me from returning.

It had been a year since our last visit to Old Spaghetti Factory.  What a difference a year makes!  My dinner was not too impressive.  Actually no one in our party of four was thrilled with their meal.  Very small portions and the food seemed like it was not even cooked fresh.  Don't think that we will be back any time soon.  I am pretty sad about that, as I have fond memories of OSF.

If you wait an hour to get seated, the food and service better be good.  Well the service was pretty poor.  At least the food was good once we all got it.  Also we were there for a birthday and the waitress knew it, but did noting special for it.  However she blew us off when we needed something to go and sing at another table.

Decided to stop on for dinner and drinks. Happy hour deals are not that much of a deal. The wings were a pretty big disapointment all together. First off they were not hot and the sauces were all pretty saltly.   We will stick with Buffalo Wild Wings next time.

Went with my family for dinner and it was a total disappointment.  It took almost 20 minutes to get two milkshakes, then appetizers and salads all came out at different times. But the worst part was our strippers were incorrect.  Both my wife and I ordered them.  When they came they were not what we had thought we ordered.  Instead of boneless, skinless strips, they were basically chicken fingers.  I was told that that is what they are.  However that is not what the picture in the menu looked like.  In fact they were the same things that my son had ordered off of the kids menu.  We asked the server and she said yes that is what the strippers are.  She said that we should have said naked and grilled.  When we told her that is what we wanted, she tried to talk us out of it as it would take 20 minutes.  We said yes we will wait as we were not going to eat what was brought to us.    While we were waiting, the manager came over and spoke to us.  She even said that she would take the items off of our bill.  SO after about 20 minutes, the new strippers came and they were basically chopped up pieces of a chicken breast.    Then the bill came and the two orders of strippers were on the bill.  When I asked the waitress about it, she asked the manager about it.  She told us, that they did not charge us for the 1st order of strips that we did not eat. WOW!  I was too in shock to say anything else.  I paid my bill and left.  $85 for a horrible dining experience.  I will not be back to this location.

My wife introduced me to this place and I absolutely love it!  I am hooked on their Greek Salad with Gyros.  I do not dine in often abut utilize their take out service as it is quick and just as delicious.

Great place to go with the kids and with large parties.  Great wings, and you can order as many combos and flavors as you want.  Thursday is .35 wing night!

Went here one night for a birthday dinner with a few friends.  To say we were unimpressed, would be an understatement.  Several items that we ordered we were told that they were out of.  The food was good but not great.  Two of us ordered the side wedge salad with our meal.  We laughed when it actually came on our plate. For the prices on the menu, this place needs to step it up.

I went in for lunch yesterday and the food and service were amazing.  Possibly the best brick over pizza in AZ.  But don't forget about their salads.  I love their Caprese salad.  It is so simple and so fresh!  I love this place and need to dine here more often.

Stopped in after a dbacks game with some friends.  The place was packed as a UFC fight was on.  But after 15 min we got a table for our group.  We enjoyed some drink and apps and everyone had a great time.  Lots of TV's so this would be a great place to watch sports.

This is seriously some of the best coffee around.  Stopped by for a quick cup of coffee with a friend.  The staff was so nice and the coffee was so good, we now meet here weekly for coffee and to catch up.

The Pita Jungle has delicious but healthy food.  My son 8 year old  is the one who originally  turned to this place.  They even offer healthy meals for kids and educate them on how to eat healthy.  I need to make sure to visit the Pita Jungle more often.

The food is really good.  However the service is horrible.  While this is expected at an airport restaruant, this should not be the case since is is a FRC establishment.

I have been to the original in Detroit and this place does it just like the real one.  Open 24 hours to get a good taste at anytime.

I had been wanting to try this place out for a while, so i was happy to get and then use a Groupon.  I am happy that I finally made it here.  We dined on great steaks and had fabulous service.  I will defiantly be back as this is a great local steakhouse.

Another great place that my wife turned me on to.  Lots of tasty options on the menu.  Not to mention the great chips and salsa that they serve you upon arrival.  The services is fast and friendly as well.

My family and I just love this place!  There is so much to do and it is all so fun!  Be sure to get a meal at the cafe as the food and service are great.  Also the one day special that they run each summer is the best deal in town!

I am so happy that I finally made it to Zipps.  The bar staff is very friendly and the beers are big and cold.  They have great happy hour prices and all of the food that I have tried has been great.  I look forward to many return visits.

We went here because I had bought a Groupon.  I am so glad that we did.  The food and service were great!  We started with a couple of cocktails and the Humus Nachos (based on other reviews).  Yum!  My wife had a grilled sandwich and I went with a burger.  We each enjoyed our choices.  One thing that we did not care for was upgrading our fries to "Salut Style"    We finished things off with Smores for two.  All and all it was a great dinner and we look forward to coming back again soon!

I am so glad that I deiced to check out this place that is so close to my office.  I have yet to order something that I did not like.  The tacos are amazing!  They also have a great salsa and condiments bar.  You are able to dress up your tacos however you want.  Don't forget about taco Tuesday!  Get three for the price of two.

Who knew that you could get such great pizza in Downtown Las Vegas.  First we order an assortment of appetizers and a few salads to share.  We then ordered a Romana pizza.  It servers five people and is like getting three pizzas.  So you get lots of different tastes. They also have lots of good beers to choose from.

I was lucky enough to have our company party here this year and it was amazing.  First off I will admit that I love chocolate.  But CVB takes chocolate to the next level.  For our dipping party were were presented with both milk and dark chocolate. We then had the opportunity to dip or cover various items in this delicious chocolate.  The chocolate is so good, that even pepperoni dipped in chocolate was excellent.  Now if you are not there for dipping, their display cases are filled with so many delicious items you will just have to get a few to take with you.  Additionally you can get a fresh Belgium waffle cover in chocolate too!  This place is definitely a treat, so be sure to visit it when in the area.

Went here for lunch with a group of co-workers and was very appalled by the managers' unwillingness to modify a simple salad to meet my diet needs.  I was really at a loss at how dismissive the manager was and did not care one bit about a paying customer.  I can tell you for sure that I will not be coming back here.  That is really a shame as I prefer to support local businesses.

The B gates do not have as many options for grab and go food.  This was my first time here and I enjoyed the wrap that I took on my flight.

Great rich and flavorful food is in abundance at this little place.  The menu changes, but some  of the best items are always available.  I suggest coming with friends, so you can try lots of items.

This is based on my visit to the walk up counter in the mall to the sit down restaurant.  I got a Sonora dog and it was great.  I also liked that I was give chips and salsa just like I was in the sit down restaurant. Maybe next time I will go inside and see what else they have to offer.

Just love this place. It is a top notch facility. It is a great place to go with family and friends. You don't have to be a golf pro to have fun here. I come here with my kids all the time and they have a blast as well.   Also the food and drinks are great too. Lots of good deals depending on the day or time.   The staff is very helpful and extremely friendly.   If you get a chance, sign up for one of their tournaments, they are a blast and a great deal.   Sonif you are looking for something fun to do, as well as a place to get some good food and drinks, you should head over to Topgolf.

Went in for a few drinks before going to the comedy club next door.  The bartender made something up for me based on what i wanted.  Very cool.  The place is huge and looks like there is a big food menu as well.

I love that this place has opened up so close to our house.  We took advantage of their opening special and still have a membership.  We are getting great use out of it.  The staff is always friendly and full of smiles.

I should have read the reviews before we went here. Lesson learned. This will be my last time here.
