The lady bartender   who sounded like a man, appeared to be drunk and had an attitude.. All I wanted to know is if I paid her for both drinks.. She said really. Hymned and Hawed irritated she had to look for my tab. She kept saying her whole family are red heads and they are nothing.. She was the manliest rudest female I've encountered.Not going back ever....BTW I was right. She only.charge me for one drink..I knew it! Ha

I'm absolutely disgusted with this place.. Flies are all over, I'm swatting them as I type.. The food is cold ,no flavor, grossest items like chicken feet, cold crawdads, mushy  skinny watery crab legs, fish with eye balls,mushy squid , cold stretchy baby octopus .. I feel sick  ...Not to mention this is an Asian place and our greeter at our table didn't speak a lick of English.. Since I have never been there before I needed to know how it works what it costs ect... She kept saying " you eat" omg

Love  this place! It has a restaurant /bar  ( red embers)  to the left when you walk in. To the right are the arcade games and laser tag..walk straight through and you get to the bowling alley that glows in the dark, to the right of that is a 21 and over bar/bowling alley with couches and High top tables ect... There's also another bar just outside that tucked between the bowling alley and arcade.. Food  is always  amazing.. my favorite is the chicken and vegetables... It has  grilled chicken, asparagus, artichoke hearts , red and green peppers,onion and lots of yumminess. ..... Bonus  for me is that there is karoake with a live band on Thursday nights .amazing sound system and the host is a favorite local entertainer/singer that makes it extra fun. Yes... I love this place!
