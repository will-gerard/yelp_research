I'm a big fan of the doughnuts but I have to say the girl that usually works the drive through at the Arcadia location can be really unfriendly for no reason....  Everyone else that works there is great but I think she needs a vacation...

Went to the new FEZ on Sunday.  Very hungry and ready for a good burger.  Sat outside which was nice and had a good server but she was really busy.  Asked for her recommendation and ended up with the Blue Cheese Burger with a fried egg on top.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done.  The egg on top literally could not have been more over done.  It was more like a hard boiled egg.  The smug little man that brought it to me acted like I was crazy to have wanted my egg to be runny.  Is it me or isn't the reason you get an egg on a burger to have the yolk run out.....!?!  I don't know, maybe I am crazy.  I asked to have it redone and the egg and the burger both came out raw.  I didn't have the energy to send it back again but I should have.  I was able to get half of it down (starving at that point and everyone else was basically finished eating) and paid the consequences later.  I did think the fries and side salad were good though.  Don't usually post bad reviews but for some reason felt the need on this one.  There are a lot of places for good burgers in town and this was definitely bottom of the barrel.  The thing that made me most angry though was the condescending, sarcastic guy/manager/food runner that acted like I was crazy.
