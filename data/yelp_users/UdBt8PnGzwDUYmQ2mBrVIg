Love Biltmore Ophthalmology! Dr. Bob Bullington is a wonderful physician. After trying several other practices, I found Bob Bullington. I was immediately impressed by the front office staff: they are friendly and very helpful. I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my scheduled appointment. Dr. Bullington spends a lot of time with you, performs all the exams himself and he has a fabulous bed side manner. You do not find physicians like Dr. Bob anymore. I trust him implicitly. I have referred several people to him and they all have had a great experience at Biltmore Ophthamology. I would not trust my eyes to anyone else! A rare find indeed!

Love Dr. Forney and his staff! I wouldn't trust anyone else to take care of my teeth! Even when I moved, I would come back to see Dr. Forney for my dental care. I have been with Dr. Forney for over 18 years! He is the best! I love Karen, my hygienist- I trust her implicitly. The office is super clean and front office staff is so helpful and friendly! I can't stay enough good things about Dr. Forney & his wonderful staff!

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!, I will NEVER rent from this company ever again! The truck was in horrible condition- very difficult to drive and needed maintenance. The truck broke down the second day I had it and it 2 1/2 hours for roadside assistance to come- throwing off my moving schedule and canceling other people who were going to unload on the other end. The coverage they up-sell you on is a joke! I was told "it covers everything up to $80,000." I purchased it and when I needed it, I was told I purchased the "wrong coverage"! How would I know this? The agents were very unhelpful and ran through all the paperwork so quickly and did not explain the coverage properly. They were rushing through all the paperwork- "initial here", "decline here", etc. bad customer service and trucks that are in poor working condition. With so many other options, I would never return to this location or perhaps Uhaul altogether.

I have been going to Jean for manicures and pedicures for almost 6 years now! She is fabulous! Over the years, I have gone from natural nails to acrylic to gel to natural and back to gels- she does it all and does it great! Jean is always flexible with her scheduling and is always willing to do what it takes to get me in even with short notice or if I have a "nail emergency" :) I get so many compliments on my nails and my mani and pedis last for 3-4 weeks- which I love! The  atmosphere is fun and lively back in the nail area which makes it feel like a a mini gal pal get together!

I can only rave about the treatment I have received from Dr. Hobgood. Dr. Hobgood is extremely passionate about the work he performs and  spends a lot of time with each client to make certain he understands the cliemt's wants and desires. He has a wonderful bedside manner and is extremely pleasant and easy to talk with. His office staff are extremely warm , friendly and efficient. Dr. Hobgood is a true thought leader in his field and I give him my highest recommendation!

UNPROFESSIONAL, UNCARING and RUDE!  As a healthcare professional and having owned and managed several pediatric clinics here in the Valley, I was shocked and disgusted with the lack of professionalism and to the indifference to the needs of patients demonstrated at the FastMed URGENT CARE Clinic!  My Husband injured his back and was unable to walk or sit. He was in constant agonizing pain. I made an appointment at FastMed, we arrived early and filled out the necessary paperwork. We waited 40 minutes past our scheduled time while the pain my Husband was experiencing increased in severity and had become unbearable. He fell to the floor and was lying on the floor unable to get up. The front office employee, Dana simply ignored the situation while others in waiting area looked on in horror and some even asked Dana if "there was someone who could  help the man on the floor". Her response over and over was simply, "Someone will be right with him". After I took care of him and tried to make him more comfortable, I went and asked Dana if my Husband could go back and lie on an exam table as he was unable to sit. It was awful to see him  lying on the floor in so much pain in the waiting area! With much reluctance, she got up to ask someone if he could come back. So, after 55 minutes, my Husband was brought back and he was allowed to lie on exam table. We waited for 15 minutes for someone to come into room to check on him. I then spoke to someone in the back to let them know we had been waiting OVER an hour and my Husband was in extreme pain. Again, I was told, "The doctor will be right with you".  About 10 minutes later, a medical assistant popped her head in and said, "The doctor will be with you soon". When I tried to tell her how much pain my Husband was in, she ignored me and walked out of exam room. The Physician Assistant, Jie Ding came in about 12-15 minutes later, looking very annoyed and without looking at either one of us stated, "What is all the moaning about?" - his bedside manner was abhorrent and rude. After everything we experienced up to that point, along with the treatment we received from the PA, Ding, we opted to leave immediately and go to an Emergency Department. (We chose FastMed because an ED generally can be  busier with extremely long wait times along with higher co-pays.) Upon entering Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn ED, the nurse and aides moved quickly upon seeing the condition of my Husband and came out to assist him to a room. The physician immediately came in assessed the situation, ordered X-rays and gave my Husband medication to ease his pain until they were able to view the images and fully examine my Husband to make a proper diagnosis. The nurses and physician were efficient, caring, competent and knew how to address the needs of the patient. We received OUTSTANDING care at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn.  NEVER again will I ever step foot in a FastMed Urgent Care clinic!
