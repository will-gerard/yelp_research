After all the issues we've had finding food sushi in Phoenix, I was worried about beginning to Indian food venues.  Luckily, we were much more successful with this type of food. The Indian Delhi Palace was absolutely scrumptious, and just as awesome, it was incredibly affordable.  The Samosas were perfectly sized and scrumptious.  I wish that they'd brought the tamarind sauce out before them with the chutney, but it did go perfectly with the samosa.  I got Malai Kofta.  Not exactly what I was expecting (it's my favorite dish), as it was a bit different than other places I've had it, but it was still delicious.  My partner got a good ol' favorite; Saag Paneer. It was a bit too spicy for her (her fault for ordering it medium), but we wound up mixing the two sauces together, and it was perfect. Portions were generous, especially given the affordable prices.  The service was so-so; our glasses stayed empty for some time before they got refills.  I wish I'd gotten a mango lassi, but it was a bit pricey, and we chose the Samosas instead. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the naan was sold separately, but I guess that's the way lots of places are going now.  All told, it was delicious, comforting and satisfying Indian food, and we were quite impressed! I can't wait to try their lunch buffet.

Absolutely delicious, and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.  The menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.  Everyone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.  One thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill.

We're not big fans of chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory is an exception.  You always know you're going to get tasty food, and a large serving (usually enough to share or take home half).  Plus, they've got a huge menu with a good number of veggie options (veggie burger, salads, pastas, sandwiches, etc).  I love love love their avocado eggrolls.  So much deliciousness wrapped in wonton skins and then fried, with a yummy cilantro sauce. MMMM.  Their corn cakes are also good, but the sauces on them aren't veggie; just ask for salsa instead.  I also love the brown bread they serve with all meals, even if you're just getting starters or cheesecake.  Speaking of which, they're actually pretty good, says my cheesecake snob partner (who is from NY), and big enough to share easily.  I've actually been over-serviced at multiple cheesecake locations, which I guess is better than not getting enough.  On NYE, we went here for Cheesecake, drinks and the free champagne toast; we had two almost identical servers who clearly didn't communicate, and the two of us wound up with four classes of bubbly instead of two. I'm not gonna argue.  They may have their off days for service, but their food is good, their menu long, and their servings big. It's hard to argue with that.

I like Walgreens overall. I've used them in AZ, CO, PA and FL, and until I started using this one, never had a problem.  However, in the 9 months I've been here, this one has proven itself more inept than all the other pharmacies I've used in my life...combined. They've lost prescriptions, entered quantity and refill numbers wrong, had their automated system call me saying I had something to pick up when I didn't and not call me when my pills WERE ready (I mentioned this to the pharmacist -- his answer? "It's a multi-million dollar system, so there are bound to be some errors"). They haven't known the answers to some questions, have sent me on a merry chase, have charged me for three nuva-rings when they only gave me one...need I go on?  As soon as this last prescription they've messed up (without telling me) that I'm waiting for comes in, I'll be switching pharmacies. I should have done it months ago. Ugh.

I wish I could give this place five stars, I really do. I've been to all vegan (this place is no, but is close) Chinese restaurants in NY, Philly and Boulder, and was hoping that this would be similar.  It took us three tries to even get to eat here, as they have odd hours to start with, and seemed to be closed sometimes when their sign said that they should be open.  The first time, we were the ONLY people in the whole place, and it still took us 45 minutes to get served, and another 20 from when we were done until we could get our check. The second visit, there were other people there, but there were more servers, and it took, no kidding, over an hour to even get our soup. AN HOUR.  Our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that.  The food? It's ok.  It's not amazing, but as a vegetarian, it's nice to know that you can eat anything on a menu. The Mushroom Hot Pot was ok but a little bland. I liked the steamed dumplings, but the sauce was a bit odd.  Don't forget the odd TVs all around the place playing interesting cult-like clips about Supreme Master Ching Hai and his biddings. Which is kinda cool to begin with, but when you're sitting there for an hour or two, it gets a bit old.  I really wanted to like this place, but I can't. We won't be going back unless they get a big overhaul.

Great food, great prices.  Not so friendly for computers; not a ton of outlets, and the internet was a little shaky upon the few times I used it.  However, they have delicious knishes and ruggulah, and this little Jewess has to give them mega points for that, as well as their $.25 refills on the daily iced tea, and their amazing photos/books of animals waiting to be adopted. Broke my heart a little, and I almost went home with a 4th fur kid, but I love coffee shops that are actively a part of the community.  My favorite barista Meschelle doesn't seem to work there anymore, but I love the atmosphere of chill during the day, the books to read, and the drink AND food menus.  Great local, indie owned coffee place. I do wish they had more than one iced tea option, especially since kiwi strawberry seems common, and I'm not so much a fan.

Delicious and awesome is really all that needs to be said about this place.  Yes, it has yuppy prices for many things. Yes, parking is absolutely ridiculous -- only one available handicap spot, about 10 other spaces and the rest is valet ($3).  That aside, this place is amazing. Whether you sit in the more cozy indoor area, or the warmed-by-heaters-in-the-winter outdoor side, the atmosphere is fun and welcoming. The staff have always been incredibly warm and attendant, and the food?  As a vegetarian, I've tried all of the non-meat bruschetta, and while the apple and brie, and goat cheese with red peppers both remain my favorites, they are all amazing.  My partner and our friends love the salami one as well.  The white bean dip and artichoke spread opening course are also delicious.  Their sandwiches and salads are both the perfect size, and I was lucky enough the other day to try a cup of soup; tomato gouda. It was divine!  If you go after 8 on Monday or Tuesday, they have a "bruschetta sampler" (4 kinds of your choice) and bottle of wine deal for just $20.  A little steep, yes, but the food and the atmosphere are more than worth it. Oh yes, their alcoholic drinks are tasty, and their tropical iced tea is also delicious.  Highly recommend!

After over a decade of migraines, and at least 7 or 8 neurologists across the country, I have finally found a place that is actually able to help and treat my migraines, not the symptoms.   Both Drs Hetrick and Lovell are wonderful in working to find the right combo of meds (including getting me off the one that caused me to gain 30+ lbs in the past 6 months), but also in a full spectrum treatment.  They're the first to tell me that my severe TMJ might be a main cause of my migraines, and are working with stretching and mouth guards to help alleviate pain. Plus, Dr. Lovell introduced me to trigger point injections and "spray and stretch." Yesterday, for about 3 hours, I had no migraines, and more importantly, no residual underlying headache. It is the first time I've felt this kind of relief in almost 4 years.  I would highly recommend this practice, particularly Dr. Lovell and Dr. Hetrick. Together, in only two appointments, they have made my headaches more manageable than they have ever been. Plus, it doesn't take three months to get a bloody appointment.

Doctors were wonderful. Billing office was a complete nightmare. They are now calling me in the end of April 2011 regarding an insurance claim in 2010, drug me through a whole rigamorale regarding having a new insurance provider and when I finally asked for exactly who they needed me to call and what they needed me to do, they told me nothing for now. Then they did the "oh, PS, we need your address to bill you for $1200 worth of services from early 2011. We just found out TWO MONTHS ago (March 3rd) that they are not going to cover it.  I would never recommend such an office to anyone that has medical problems beyond a general check up. It appears that I am going to suffer the consequences of their loosey goosey billing office in the form of hundreds of dollars of bills.

I've been to a lot of paint your own pottery places, and with the exception of my favorite place in the middle of nowhere Montana, this one is the best.  Why?  They have a great (and actually affordable) selection of items, from soap dishes to mugs, giant serving platters to cupcake boxes.  Many items are under $15, which is better than some other local PYOP places I've been to.  The studio fee is $8 for adults, but you can find a coupon for $2 off online, so it's not too bad. We painted our stuff on a Saturday evening, and were told it was set for pick up on Tuesday after 4pm -- not a bad turn around.  Better yet, the staff as awesome, friendly, and Tom was a rockstar! He taught us some awesome new techniques, was helpful about bringing examples over, and really made for a fun and fabulous date night with two adults painting holiday presents for family.  We had a freaking blast, and absolutely cannot wait to go back!

I found this doctor near my work via Yelp and Aetna, and was a little worried when I walked in; the TV in the waiting area had on Glenn Beck.  Was I a little scared? Yes. However, the nice receptionist was kind enough to keep me there.  The theme of everything is the Hawaiian Islands, which was nice and fairly relaxing.  I waited a bit longer than I thought, but I wasn't in a hurry, so that was ok.  The nurse taking my weight, blood pressure, etc was a little brusque, but nice enough, and then Dr. Loo came in.  He's nice, believes what you say (I'm a 24 year old with arthritis, 3 surgeries behind me and 4 to go, yet most doctors can't seem to understand that it is painful for me to walk), and had good suggestions. He actually gave me a PT script instead of making me find an orthopedist out here. I really appreciated it.  All in all, a good visit. Just loses one star for scaring me with Glenn Beck.

I love coming here in nice cool weather and enjoying the lake view on the patio, although the ducks are not always the most polite of dining companions.  The last time I was here, I branched out and got the pesto pizza. Basically, it was a pita with pesto, a bunch of raw, barely cut up veggies (including an entire mushroom), and cheese, just melted for a moment. I was unimpressed.  Luckily, it wasn't my first time. Their gazpacho, tomato and red lentil soups are all amazing, and my favorite is the spinach feta quesadilla. Best quesadilla I've ever had. The iced tea is delicious, they're quick to refill, and will often offer you a travel cup to go.  Service, while a bit slow, is very friendly, and I love the number of vegetarian options.  Price point can be a bit high, but the food is good quality, and except the pita pizza, it is DELICIOUS. Looking forward to being a continuous customer.

I was actually really impressed, even though I didn't think I would be.  I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy.  They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).  I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.  My server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding.  I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!

Thank the mooses, we've finally found a decent, affordable, not too yuppy sushi place in this state.  We found it by accident; some out of town friends inviting us out the dinner. After our terrible sushi experiences were, I'll admit, I was nervous! I mean, we've have fish scales in food, 3 hour long waits and more.  Not here. They have a huge menu of both sushi and other Japanese delights, and between the four of us, we tried a lot.  Let's break it down: Edamame -- perfect. Goyza -- not bad. Eggplant in ginger miso - DELICIOUS and gone in 2.5 seconds. Cold tofu w/  ginger -- not worth it. Wouldn't order it again. Could make it at home easily. Yakisoba -- Lots of veggies, lots of noodles. Great! Philly roll -- delicious Sweet potato roll - AMAZING Avocado roll - MASSIVE amounts of avocado, greats size, great taste Spicy tuna roll - Tasty Sprimp tempura roll - Yummy The weird "mountain potato and sour plum sauce" veggie roll -- sour, salty and sweet all in one. None of the three of us liked this one, but it was worth a try.  The service was pretty snappy, although our server did have to go back and ask a question or two.  Overall? A great time, with good service, delicious food (and fresh tasting fish, according to my co-diners), and very affordable when the final bill came.  I just wish we lived closer...although that could be dangerous!

We came here earlier this year for a friend's birthday -- what a pleasant find.  Not only were they queer friendly (which seems to be a difficult find here in AZ), but the pianist was really amazing, the atmosphere was classy yet relaxed, and the service was impeccable.   I'd brought my friend a bottle of her favorite wine as part of her present, to save for later. The server saw it under the table, and asked if we'd like to have it chilled for dessert; no corkage fee! I was very impressed with him being so kind and helpful.  It was pretty vegetarian friendly; I wound up with an AMAZING bowl of mushroom-brie soup. Just to die for.  My partner started with a different soup, which she liked, but was a little spicy for me.  For my entree, I got the bruscetta, which were good; about on par, or a little less awesome then Postino's. My partner got the turkey sandwich and devoured it.  Our friends both got wraps; one said hers was a little try, so the server brought her some mayo, and she said it really made it excellent.  We're bringing some out of town friends here this weekend -- I can't wait to try something new.

I've been to a few Ren Faires in various states (my favorite is in Larkspur, CO), and this is towards the top of my list.  First of all, they have their shit together. From signs all down 60 assuring you that you're going the right way, to having a specific Ren Faire lane to a plethora of parking attendants, everything was organized perfectly.  Before I talk about the Faire itself, I have to say I was incredibly impressed at how disability accessible this place was. Between tons and tons of handicap park, ramps into each store, first aid people walking around with red cross flags so you knew where the first aid was, and even handicap reserved seating at the joust.  I give them an A+ on that.  The shops were great; found an excellent variety of things for sale.  I got a great cane, candles, incense, jewelry and more. Food was good too; lots of veggie and meat options. We got broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl (soup was ok, bread bowl was super delicious!), falafel (good), chocolate covered nut rolls (delicious!) and a good juicy pickle.   Drinks were huge for the $3 we paid, and could be found all over.  I also liked how much seating there was, both in sun and shade.  We were able to stay longer because of being able to take breaks.  The staff themselves were nice, but I didn't feel that many of them were as "into" their rolls as other faires I've been to.  I'd say "good morrow" and get "how are you doing?" in return.  Not a big deal, but just would have bumped it up to 5 stars.  Worth the $18 the tickets were at Frys? Yes, but just barely. I hope they don't raise their prices!

Love love love this grocery -- only wish it was closer to my home.  They have ridiculously fresh produce for an incredibly cheap price (better than Safeway or Frys), and their employees are always so friendly and full of info about anything you might need.  Are their organic/all natural products a bit high priced? Some of them, yes, but their tofu, soy milk, etc, is on par with any traditional store. I also appreciate them being willing to order things in if they don't have it.  I love their potted herbs, their fresh bread, their bulk section (including delicious granola), their fresh coffee...I mean, what's not to love about your friendly neighborhood Sunflower?

This is my 100th review, so I was waiting for something I could give 5 stars to.  This place, it deserves 5 stars. Ergo, it wins my 100th review!  We went here on a Friday night, having gotten a couple for $8.99 bowling and shoes for 2 hours. Upon entering, we were told it was extreme bowling night (basically, cosmic bowling), and that they coupon didn't count. However, she went to check with her manager, and they honored it anyways. I really appreciated that.  While I brought my own ball, my partner doesn't have one, so she needed to use one of theirs. Instead of rows of balls where you have to go pick out the best you can find, they have a finger hole sizer, where you tell them which size finger holes you need, and in what poundage. Like "medium holes, 9 pounds." or "extra large holes, 12 pounds" and so on.  I was impressed.  Once at our lane, we were greeted by our server, who handed us the menu. I have NEVER seen a veggie burger on a bowling alley menu, along side regular burgers, pizza, wings, spinach dip, and more.  Again, impressed.  While the drinks with alcohol looked divine, we stuck with iced teas. Served in huge glasses, and quickly refilled, the service was great.  Bowling was fun, as always, and we stayed for three games before heading out. I loved the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff (special shout out to Maria at the front desk), and the fun, laid back atmosphere. I also loved the mix of "today's" and 90's music - I liked hearing a little Ace of Base, Sublime and Offspring mixed in with Rhianna and current rap.  We'll definitely be back. Great for either a date night or hanging with friends.

We ended up here one night after grocery shopping, and craving Italian food (my partner is full blooded Italian -- Olive Garden just doesn't cut it).  The prices? Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.  The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.  The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.  I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.

My new car needed an oil change, and this Midas is right on the way home (and next to my favorite Phoenix area Dunkin Donuts), so I stopped by. They told me they could do it, no problem, within an hour. Price was 19.95. Great. GIANT sign/banner out front said that all oil changes included a free tire rotation - score!  I dropped off the keys, and headed over to Dunkin Donuts for an iced tea and bagel while I was waiting. After an hour...I finally walked back over, because I never got a call. My car had obviously been done some time -- it was waiting in a parking space, and all the lifts were down.  When I went to pay, my car suddenly needed a new synthetic oil that my last mechanic either hadn't told me about, or charged me extra for. Another $10 bucks. Ok. Fine. Thanks for telling me, but at least its done.  On my way out, I double checked: "so you rotated my tires too, yes?" The answer? No. Despite the sign saying FREE TIRE ROTATION WITH EVERY OIL CHANGE, you have to actually ask/sign up for a tire rotation. They don't just do it.  Ken Bohl's place on Thomas does have the longer hours, but they have better prices, better service, and something like a free 20 inspection AND tire rotation with every oil change...and you don't have to ask for the free things they promise. I think I'll head back there next time.

Absolutely amazing! We accidentally discovered this place our first night that we moved to Phoenix while looking for a place for our vegan and gluten free friend, and have gone back at least monthly ever since.  The portions are perfectly sized, and the prices are ridiculously low. The food is incredibly tasty, both vegetarian (even vegan) and meat alike. Whether you're in the mood for straight up Ethiopian, or wanting more of the traditional falafel, they have both options.  Their house iced tea is a spiced chai (remembering that chai actually means tea), and is really refreshing. I love their lentil soup as well.  And then there are all of the delicious veggie options; I like to get the sampler with 5 choices for around $8.50, but if you only want a main one and 2 sides, they are all under $7 (for the veggie ones). The injera is fun to eat with and very tasty.  Also, we love the staff.  Always friendly, willing to make suggestions, help a newbie to Ethiopian when we've brought friends, and more. We actually celebrated our anniversary here because we like it so much; complete with raw, vegan pumpkin pie.  Best pumpkin pie I've ever had, and there wasn't even any pumpkin in it.  Blue Nile has stolen my heart, and I'll be going back quite frequently.

The staff here made the place awesome. They were friendly, on top of things (including when I lost my cell phone), and didn't really blink an eye at the crazy antics of the adult webmasters.  I loved how close they are to food, bars, and even adult romance store on Mill -- I could just walk through the court yard and hit Rula Bula and RA.  However, I had two things I didn't like as much. A) there wasn't enough non-outdoor, non-sunny space to hang out in. Yes, it's Phoenix and people come here to get tan...but I live here, and burn ridiculously easily. Yet everything was in the sun, because there was no large, sun-free area.  Also, b) while the lobby, courtyard and seminar rooms were nice, the hallways and actual hotel rooms seemed a bit outdated. Also, trying to find the pool with no signs? Not so much fun.  All in all, a nice hotel and the perfect place to hold a pervert conference. I'm sure I'll be back at some point!

This is your average, run of the mill (no pun intended) Irish Pub. And it doesn't try to pretend to be anything else, nor does it need to.  The outdoor patio is especially nice, both on nice days, and even in the winter (they have epic heaters outside).   The happy hour is great, both for food and booze.  They don't have a ton of vegetarian options, so I've been using this place as more of a bar than a place for food.  However, their bread pudding is surprisingly delicious, and worth ordering. Also, in the winter, they have alcoholic hot chocolate, which is AMAZING. Really, really amazing.  Staff is nice and helpful, really fun. Wednesday night is trivia night, so they'll be packed. Be forewarned.  This is a great place to meet friends for a pint (they have cider too!) and have a good time.  Not a great place for vegetarians to eat.

Good? Yes. Great? Perhaps, in time.  I'm just still missing Watercourse Foods in Denver, and it's hard not to compare.  The vegan wings here were ok, but nothing like other places I've had. We were hoping they'd be more like buffalo wings, but the sauce was far more Asianic.    That said, everything we have ordered (dumplings, samosas, stir fries, sandwiches) has been good, just not quite outstanding.  I love their Thyme fries though -- delish.  Service was a bit slow, but I've learned that this is standard fare in vegan/veggie places, so it didn't bother us much. The people watching, plus artwork on the walls, made the time pass quickly, and the staff themselves were incredibly outgoing and friendly.  I definitely want to go back and try an Tsoynami -- they're just a little pricey.  Will have to wait till I'm really craving.  I love that they have lots of vegan items for sale; they have some hard to find things that lots of my vegan friends love. It's hard not to overspend.  I like their tea/limade/tamari drink options as well; can be fun if you mix them, and I love that their cups are compostable!  All in all, a great vegan spot to get something comforting, but can be a little pricey for a "quick service" style place.

Avenue Q was brilliant.  Keep in mind, however, that Avenue Q comes with a traveling cast.  The Gammage Auditorium itself?  Not impressed.  From the outside, yes, it looks really cool. Some of the lights are out, but over all, it looks really cool from the outside.  Inside? It's a bit outdated. The bathrooms are gross, and half of the floors are completely handicap inaccessible. Of course, they don't tell you this when you get your tickets.  We showed up, and asked where the elevator was. Rudely, we were told there wasn't one, and if I had wanted accessible seats, I should have bought full priced orchestra ones.  I walk slowly and with a cane, and while I can handle a few stairs when I must, the 2.5 flights of stairs nearly killed me on the way up, and then I didn't go to the restrooms when I wanted too at intermission, because there was no way in hell I would have walked back up there.  I almost burst into tears as it was.  I then had to rinse and repeat to get down at the end.  Again, multiple flights of stairs, people pushing me, and rude ushers chiding me for not buying outrageously priced orchestra tickets which were accessible.  Way to be classist AND ableist at the same time.  Funny, isn't it, that such a tongue in cheek commentary on discrimination should be held at a place that both architecturally AND verbally discriminates?

I was really really really hoping that this was going to be *the* place. Since moving to Phoenix, I haven't found any good sushi places, so I was hoping.  Shouldn't have bothered.  Not only was there epic construction making it difficult to get to (not their fault), but I felt like I'd walked into a time warp. Our table was towards the back of the completely empty restaurant, and you could just smell the cigarette smoke wafting in from the lounge. Gross.  There was a great happy hour drink menu...that the waitress then pointed out to us was no longer valid. Ever. Not because we weren't there in time, but because it just didn't apply.  Heavens forbid they take the time to take out the piece of paper, and turn it around to the white side (as I did).  Their menu had prices blacked out on the sashimi (I kinda get this -- market price changed, and they didn't want to re-print the whole menu), but also on the edamame.  Um, what?  We were all sat by 6:35.  By 6:45, we were ready to order. Nada.  Finally, at 6:57, one of us took our order up to our waitress chilling at the bar (no one else at tables at this point) to make sure we got our order in before 7pm, for the happy hour sushi specials. Greeeeat.  As far as vegetarian options, I got the agedashi tofu, miso soup, and invented my own roll (cucumber, avacado and cream cheese).  The menu had only a cucumber roll and a garden roll (that came with egg in it). Don't expect them to be veggie friendly.  My cohorts got their rolls, and all of us did enjoy the sushi, hence this place getting more than 1 star.  I placed a to-go order for my sick partner. They didn't have a regular Philly Roll on the menu (what?), so I asked if they could make it.  After much debate, they said they could. And then charged me NINE DOLLARS for it.  Let's see -- my friends got half price, special rolls with roe and salmon and shrimp and veggies and eel sauce and more for $5.  But salmon and cream cheese is $9. What?  Oh, and the ads in the bathroom? Expired in 2007.  Food was good. But between the prices, the service, and the weird menu issues, I'll not be coming back.

Glad I waited almost a week to write my review. Had I written it Sunday night or Monday, I would have given them 4 or 5 stars.  However, now I've seen how they operate in the long term, and have accordingly dropped my rating.  The salesman, Albert Salman, I liked. He was nice, helped me find the car *I* wanted instead of trying to sell me some piece of crap I didn't.  He wasn't able to get quite to the price I was looking for, but it was worth it having a nice, honest, open salesperson, so I decided to go with Chapman.  That is where the good experience ended.  We were put in a waiting room to wait for financing for more than half an hour, while other staff members wandered in and out, talking about golf, tv, etc, but completely ignoring us and avoiding eye contact.  Finally, we got Ernie, our finance guy.  We really wowed us with the numbers, and in not a good way. My partner recently bought a 2009 from a Chevrolet dealer in Colorado. Her extended warranty? About $10 extra a month. Mine cost about $40 extra. Yeah. I brought in my last month of paycheck stubs, but he told me he didn't needed them.  Was he pushy about trying to get gap coverage and all of that? Oh yes, but only between stories of shooting, having his guns and truck stolen, etc. Made me feel real safe knowing he had all of my personal info.  But fine, we finished up.  The used car (2009) I bought was missing a mirror cover and a keyless entry, and had a few dents. It was Sunday, so service was closed.  Albert told me they would call me about bringing it in this Wednesday (yesterday) to get all that fixed. No call. Still driving a car with dents, a scrape on the front bumper, a missing mirror cover and no keyless entry (which means no alarm I'm paying $10 a month for).  It gets better. I get a call Tuesday night from good ol' Ernie.  He tells me he's no longer sure my income ($2500 a month...with $3000 down) will cover it...don't I possibly have some more income.  Let's see here...NO.  If I had any, I would have mentioned it Sunday to lower your high numbers.  Now he wants me to fax in paycheck stubs. The ones I HAD on Sunday that he didn't want.  I have no fax.  After a good cry about all the drama, I go way out of my way to get to a fax to fax him my stubs on Wednesday, asking he call me when he got them.  No call. I called at 4, left a message to double check. No call. I called again at 7:30pm (he'd been there till 8 the night before). Left another message. No call.  Finally, today, at 2:00pm I called AGAIN. He finally picked up. No, he hadn't gotten my paycheck stubs. Yes, he'd gotten my voicemails asking whether he'd gotten them. No, he hadn't gotten around to calling me. No, he wasn't going to be in on Friday.  I called the finance department manager. Left a message.  Called my salesperson (Albert). Left a message. Still have yet to hear back from either.  I'm incredibly disappointed in Chapman, and if I could go back and do it again, I certainly would take my clearly undesired business elsewhere.  I'd give them just 1 star, but I really do think Albert is a good salesperson.  **Edit: I got a message from Albert who said he was looking into both the service issue and the finance issue.  This only further proves my point that he is the only one there that even halfway cares about the customer***

I had never heard of this place, and honesty, rarely venture West of 7th St.  However, we were having a centrally located, queer friendly group meeting, and Lux was suggested.  I was pleasantly surprised. There seems to be a dearth of cool, laid back, not-too-hipster indie coffee bars in Phoenix, but luckily, there is Lux.  With delicious baked goods (I had a date scone...I don't really even LIKE dates, but the scone was delicious!) including cupcakes and handmade drinks (and you can choose disposable to-go cups or earth-saving ceramic -- love it!), it's adorable. All of it, not just the adorable woman working the register.  We wound up sitting outside, but there was a good deal of room inside too, where people of all backgrounds were busy working away on their macs, with a scattered PC here and there.  Parking was plentiful, something I'm always on the lookout for, and while I did have to wait in line to order, it moved quickly.  I look forward to checking out the Lux a little bit more.  I bumped off a star because my chai was only so-so, but will be back to try cupcakes and a different hot drink

The only reason we ended up going here was due to a fabulous deal on Groupon, and it was quite worth it.  A little overpriced in my book, it was still fabulous. The atmosphere was great, what with trees indoors, and fire tables, and more.  I like fire, ergo, I liked this place.  We'd made our reservation online with Open Table, and got there 7 minutes early. We were told we'd have to wait, despite there being multiple open 4-tops. Finally, 5 or 6 minutes AFTER our reserved time, we (a group of 4) was lead to a 5-top.  Um, ok?  Menu was awesome. I liked that they had a vegetarian section, and that they mention they can use tofu in many of the other dishes.  However, please note that having tofu = $3 extra. Yeah.  I was pretty pissed.  Drink menu was also good; a friend had the mango mojito and it was DELICIOUS.  Food wise, everything tasted good. Not amazing, but good.  My partner had the sizzling chicken. Enough to eat and take some home (with a wonton soup, which she said was ok).  Our friends shared the duck and the miso steak.  The duck was deemed to be tasty, although on the steak dish, they said the rice underneath was better than the steak itself.  All in all, 3 entrees, 1 app (egg rolls), 1 small soup, 1 lettuce wraps (plus $3 tofu), 2 iced teas and 1 mojito = almost $100.  That, to me, is pretty high priced, considering my meal alone was less than $15. But that's what you get in Scottsdale I guess.  I'd come back with another coupon, or perhaps for dessert and drinks, but not for a full price meal.

Thank goodness I read the yelp reviews before going out to meet some friends here, or we would have NEVER found it. Ever.  Even with the tip about it being behind a big dirty parking garage, it took us a while, and then, we couldn't find the bloody entrance, not realizing that you had to go through the patio to get in. Ridiculous. Also, there are two 12" square signs with the name of the place on it, hidden amongst climbing plants.  I guess they're going for the secret cool spot vibe.  Surprisingly, we (a group of 6) were sat fairly quickly on a Saturday night...it helped that we had a couple of 20-something stereotypically hot girls with us. We were on the patio, which was nice, and had interesting art (giant lit up potato wedges?) up above, but got pretty chilly around 10pm and there were not heaters.  The waiter?  Snarky, witty, and I loved him. Good service and just enough attitude to make it fun, but not have him be an asshole.  The drink prices? RIDICULOUS.  I shouldn't have to pay more than my meal to get a nice St. Germain drink ($14!) -- and all the drinks were served in pretty small glasses, including my iced tea, of which I needed about 7 million refills.  I did like the plethora of veggie options, and my partner liked the meaty choices. She went with a BBQ sandwich, while I opted for a dinette sized AZ 88 salad and the fries with dipping sauce.  The salad? HUGE, esp for $5, and delicious.  The fries? Almost as tasty as the dipping sauces.  I didn't like the spicy ketchup, but the remolade and the buffalo blue cheese? To DIE for. Yum! All 6 members of our table gobbled their meals.  The furniture was interesting...not super comfy, but sit-able.  The women's bathroom? Odd. Really odd.  Mirrors all over, and splashes or urine on the mirrors next to the toilet as if the mirrors had confused someone as to where to actually to pee.  I did, however, LOVE the gender neutral bathroom, and how queer friendly the whole place was.  Versus the rest of Scottsdale, my partner and I actually felt like we fit in.  While the drink prices were outrageous, the rest of the stuff wasn't, and we'd totally come back, especially now that we know where it is.  Also, their music selection was excellent!  We found out they had a live DJ spinning, and how amazing is that?

I ate here the other day as a last minute "I'm early for my appointment and am super hungry" thing.  Glad I stopped by.  The seating? Meh. It's a bit crowded, and I sat at the community table. The purse hooks are nice, but sitting on a stool for an hour long meal was not good for my back, and my shoulders cried out in pain.  The menu is good; however, online they tell you if the soups are vegetarian/vegan. They don't mention it on the in-store menu. Good thing I'd looked it up, and that my server (Meschelle) knew her stuff.  I was in a bit of a hurry and not ready for a whole sandwich, so I got the gazpacho and an order of sweet potato fries.  Which come with ketchup and a house aoili, but the server let me know it had mayo in it, which means eggs.  So instead, she brought me ketchup and a nice mustard (they have 4 kinds) for dipping. I appreciated that a lot, and also her asking me about whether I wanted the goat cheese that came on my soup or not.  The fries? Delicious. Some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever been blessed to try.  I may come back just for those.  But then, I had my soup? Oh! It wasn't anything like what I'd imagined (it was way more chunky, and more like a tomato salsa than a traditional gazpacho), but it came with goat cheese and avocado on top, and it was to DIE for. So freaking good.  The service was excellent; my drink was always filled, food came out on time, and the check came out when I wanted it too, rather than too early or having to ask. The food as delicious. My only beef was having to sit on a stool and lean over a hot (because it was lit) table.  I'll be back with my partner for sure to try the burgers (her) and sandwiches (me)!

This is the first gay friendly restaurant/bar in Phoenix that I've actually really liked, and can see myself frequenting on a regular basis.  We visited on a week day night, and sat at the bar.  Our bespeckled bartender was sweet, sassy, and kept our drinks full. I also appreciated her know what was and wasn't vegetarian, and providing a delicious recommendation for the veggie/cheese enchiladas.  The chips and three kind of salsas were a yummy starter, and disappeared almost as soon as they were put in front of us.  I had a diet coke, my partner a beer, and our two friends went with mixed drinks; everyone was quite happy.  The food? Oh god.  Delicious. The first vegetarian Mexican food I've been able to find in AZ.  Everywhere else seems to have beef stock in their red sauce, but not here.  DELICIOUS! My partner got a chimichanga, and our friend one of the HUGE salads, and were all cleared our plates in no time flat.  The decor was fun, everyone was friendly, and I noticed my partner eyeing the brunch menu. Nothing like a little gay-tastic weekend brunch to really get you going. We'll most definitely be back!

The service and the heat knock this place down a star...not having A/C in AZ just seems like a horrible, horrible idea, especially in such a small space, with no waiting area, and tons of bodies packed in.   Our server (after our 25 minute scorching wait) was very nice, and kept our drinks filled...but took 30 minutes post-finishing to bring us the bill, and just as long to pick it back up with the cards...all the while, I was schvitzing and sweating.  That said, the food is freaking amazing. I had the Mushroom, Spinach, Walnut Soup, while my co-diners enjoyed the Leek soup - both were lick the bowl clean, as was the bread served with the soup. I appreciated at barrage of vegetarian Pasty options, both more with veggies (like the delicious balsamic portobello I had) as well as with faux meat, Quorn brand (yum!). My friends had the bangers and mash and the chicken greek pasties, and both were beyond satisfied. One took an order of Shirley Temple Pudding home -- if I wasn't visiting from out of town, I would have too - it smelled godly.  Would suggest visiting during an off hour, as there are no seats for waiting, and it is ridiculously hot. Plus, make sure you have lots of time for freshly made food, and medium speed service. Food is totally worth it!

I was actually really impressed with this Harkins. As one of the few theatres in the valley playing 9500 Liberty, I expected it to be tiny and unkept, like many old school indie theatres I've frequented.  But my expectations were blown away in just a moment.  The bathrooms were nice, clean and serviced, the theatre was fairly big and super comfy. I liked it. I will most definitely be back.  The only thing I have to say I didn't like (other than the high prices, but that's movies anywhere - god, it makes me feel old) was that I heard they refused to show the version of 9500 Liberty with Spanish subtitles. Given the content and purpose of this film, as well as the people who live in this state, I think that is more than slightly ridiculous, and I plan to inquire about this next time I'm in.

I've gotten to the point there I come by here almost once a week. Yes, it's addictive.   Their lunch specials menu is not very veg friendly, and neither is their free soup you get around lunch.  That said, almost everything else on the menu comes with a choice of meat, or tofu and veggies.  I LOVE both the Tom Kah and Tom Yum soups; even the half portion is huge! The salad rolls are also a great deal for $3.  If you come when it's crowded, the service is a bit slow, but it is given with a smile, and the food is great; taste and selection.  Their lunch special prices are super good, but even the non-specials are on par for a Thai place. Clearly, I come back again and again.

Fail. Whale.   Ok, I know this is not twitter, so there isn't REALLY a fail whale. But if this was, they would get one.  We got a menu from them on our door, so after getting back from vacation and being completely jet lagged, we ordered.  I was on hold on the phone a while. No biggie. Finally, they took my order.  We both went for calzones. I figured it was the easiest way to ensure it was vegetarian.  WRONG.  Not only did it take over an hour to show up, AND they charged us a delivery fee (so two calzones became over $20!), but the sauce had a very heavy meat taste. One bite, and I couldn't eat anymore. Not only that, but because they put the sauce IN the calzone as well as on the side, I couldn't eat anything.  I tried to nibble the crust.  My partner, who is not veggie, LOVED her calzone, and killed in in about 5 minutes. Both of us then spent the rest of the evening in bed, moaning and groaning with stomach aches, and there may have been a few trips to worship the porcelin gods as well.  Fail.

I'm not going to lie -- I don't like the monthly thing.  I kind of got conned into the sign up back in Denver, and I'm not sure I'll stick with it, especially since finding out that the therapist themselves get very little for the $49/month (plus $39/per extra massage) that is being paid (or so I heard from a former worker at a different location).  That said, they do have a great variety of massage therapists, from those focusing on relaxation to trigger point, deep tissue to cranial sacral.  My favorite at this location in Talisha - she's AMAZING. I'm sad she recently changed her schedule so I can't get in to see her, but she, for a while, really worked me well and limited how many migraines I was getting. I've had one session with Monique, and am looking forward to seeing her again on Monday to hopefully kick this current migraines ass. We shall see.  The front desk staff is nice...sometimes they take a little longer than I'd like, but always friendly. I do like that you can put a tip on your credit card or leave it in cash; options are nice.  Sometimes, it's feels very corporate, others a lot more intimate. As long as you know what it is, you realizing that is what you're getting, and it's a pretty good deal.

Saw Monique the other night after a 4 day long, ER inducing migraine.  I was worried, because I knew Talisha was able to make latent headaches go away for at least a week, but her schedule no longer messes with mine.  Worried for no reason -- Monique is awesome.  Not quite as friendly and chatty, but an amazing massage therapist, and I feel much better having seen her.  Front desk staff was very nice and efficient.  For those having issues, if you can, book Mondays, as they seem to have a great staff on board those nights.

I am furious.  In the last 12 months, I have had at least scheduling issues, from them calling me at 8AM on a Saturday morning (my 1 day off) to cancel my 11am appointment to last Saturday, when I went in only to be told someone had messed up, and actually booked me for the NEXT week, and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am, they couldn't get me in until maybe that evening, and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissue/medical massage. I was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then, but Ashley the clinic manager promised me that they'd give me my next week appointment free of charge, and that she'd personally be certain there were no more issues.  As I literally couldn't turn my head to the left due to pain, I took her up on that. BIG MISTAKE.  Yesterday (the Friday before my "correctly" scheduled massage, I went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment, to try and avoid last week's debacle. According to the woman who answered the phone, it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off, but she went to talk with her manager, and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok, and that she'd call with any issues. Then yesterday evening, I got ANOTHER confirmation call from Massage Envy, confirming and reminding me of my 11:30am appt on Saturday with my preferred therapist. GIven that I've had 3 migraines this week (versus my 0 or 1 when I get a massage the weekend prior), I really absolutely needed to get in, so I felt more confident.  Well, I was just woken up at 8am...again. On my day off...again. To explain to me that, big shock, they messed up my scheduling again, and that apparently, my therapist was off today. Despite Ashley's promise of it not happening again. Despite me being pro-active and calling to confirm. I am sitting here in pain, so furious at this repeated treatment that I can't even go back to bed...and the best part? They don't even have a manager on duty I can complain to.  My treatment at the hands of the booking/front desk staff has been any thing BUT relaxing. I continue to walk out of there frustrated, angry, and occasionally in tears. I know they say Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me, but I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty screwed for today and the next week, but luckily, an Elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area. At this point, it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy. As much as I love Talisha and Aisha as massage therapists, getting a massage should feel good, and not like you're just a number to them, not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend IN the appointment.

I didn't realize Harkins was a local chain, but I always like supporting local businesses.  Tickets? Still a bit pricey, but I guess that is everywhere now. I did love the concept of the popcorn t-shirt and the refillable cups, as I like the savings and the lack of paper cup waste. Plus, they had great food options, like actual FOOD instead just soda and popcorn.  Seats were comfy, the movie played well and on time, and the bathrooms were clean. I can't argue with this.  Wasn't quite super special enough for a 5 star rating, but it does get a very solid "I like this place and would come back" 4 star rating.

I can't believe it has taken us 5 months to find this place since we moved here in November.  Given how much we miss our home back in Denver, Colorado, Boulders was like a little taste of home; laid back people, friendly staff, bikes and rock climbing gear scattered about, veggie friendly menu and more.  I have a few things that bumped this down from a 5 to a 4:  a) They have Fat Tire all over the place; fat tire coasters, fat tire decoration on their specials board, bikes here and there, etc.  But when my partner was so delighted to be able to get her favorite brew, Fat Tire, and tried to order it, they explained that they didn't *actually* have Fat Tire. She wound up getting an Odell's (another CO microbrewery), which was good....but was very disappointed.  b) The menu had some intense mis-spellings, things that if they'd ran a spell check, they would have fixed. Like vegitarian. As a marketing person, errors like that always annoy me. Nit-picky? Yes. But that's how I am.  c) Our first waiter made this whole deal about how he was going off shift to drink with his friends, and would have someone else take care of us, and bid us farewell. And then came back not, once, but twice. A little odd.  d) The bathrooms were a bit gross, and the ads expired in 2008?  However, the food was delicious. Our server Lindsay was new, so she had to check on a few things, but was friendly, timely, and made us feel very welcome.  While the people who came with us weren't impressed with their wings, the dip we got was delicious, and our other friend was super happy with their pizza.  We felt like we were at home. What a nice feeling.  Yes, I'm a bit picky about little things, but over all, we loved the atmosphere, the food, the microbrews, and the friendliness. I think we've found out local bar until we moved back to CO.

This place took us a while to hear about, and then even a little more time to actually get out to,  but totally worth it.  Finding a Thai place with a legit vegetarian menu full of deliciousness is pretty difficult. This one has one, and more!  So much goodness on the menu, and they even made me something that wasn't on the menu, going above and beyond. Plus their vegetarian Tom Yum and Tom Kah soups are delicious, as is their tofu satay starter.  Service is OK, but that's there they lose a star.  Once it took ups almost 40 minutes to get our soup, and our water glasses often stay empty way too long. Plus, at least in the winter, it's always freezing in here.  However, the food and fairly affordable prices plus excellent vegetarian Thai selection make it well worth braving the mediocre service and chilly temps.

Their food is a little pricey, but their tea prices are right on par, and their selection is pretty much out of this world.  Moreover, their staff actually knows their stuff, so if you have a tea question, they can answer it for you instead of just making stuff up.  Sometimes it takes a bit longer than it should (no tea I know of takes more than 10 minutes to brew), but it's worth the wait. You can get them made hot or cold, with milk (or soy!) or without.  Add to that a nice sandwich or cupcake, and you have a perfect afternoon snack/luncheon.  Their chai selection is wonderful, as are some of their black and herbals.  If only I had the time to try everything!

Prompt service (iced team refilled after about every other sip...with only one or two exceptions), a menu the size of my novel, and a fun atmosphere makes this place a fun restaurant to come to.  Great vegetarian options, including a DELICIOUS mushroom burger and salads that not only fill you up but leave enough for take home. The fried pickles in the bar were a bit disappointing (waaay too thick), but the mushroom flat bread redeemed the bar food.  Each table is given a basket full of both wheat and sourdough breads, and they are part of the highlight of the experience. Fresh and hot, I couldn't keep my hands off the bread.  It's a chain, yes. It's in Scottsdale, by the mall, so remember to take it with a grain of salt (and keep in mind that their parking lot is a mess to navigate). However, it's a good place to come and hang out while reading, or to meet a group of friends. I'll definitely be back.

I was so excited to come here, especially after seeing their menu and pictures online.   I went with my partner and some friends to see the Samba Project, which was live music on the patio.  First of all, you had to pay $5 IN ADDITION to food and drink in order to listen to the music. Keep in mind the food starts at $10 a person, so with drinks, you're now paying at least $20 to listen to good, albeit not great music.  I walk with a cane. Our friends had gotten their earlier, and were waiting for the table, and my partner and I waited with them. Standing. For over 30 minutes. No one offered us a seat, and after half an hour, I had shooting pain, so I went to ask the hostess a) how long it would be, and b) if they had a seat. I started talking to her, and explained I was disabled, and she actually said "hold on a bit" and took a party of 2 to go stand and wait. I told her I was just going sit in my car and wait then, and she just shook her head and walked off. What an incredibly NON-disability friendly place.  Finally (having got there at 8), we got sat a little before 9.  Our waiter didn't come for another 15 minutes, and our drinks? around 9:30 or so. My partner and I ordered iced tea, expecting regular iced tea. Instead, it was sickly sweet and peach flavored. Neither of us liked it. When the server asked how my tea was, I let him know I didn't like peach. He never asked if I wanted something else, even when I asked for a glass of water and moved my tea to the middle, and when my partner said no to tea refills, even before the food showed up. Finally, I just told him to take away my glass. The only positive? He took it off the check (but not my partner's).  The food? Let's see, until almost 9:45, we only had one menu. Finally, we asked for more, and got them, and were ready to order at about 9:50.  Again, we had to wait a huge amount of time to order, and then the food took almost a full hour to come out...for 3 paninis and an order of bruschetta.  I mean, did they bake the bread fresh? It was ok. Good, but not great. I'd say Postino's was better by far on both the paninis and the bruschetta.   Then of course, it took us forever to get the check...which then came back in wet check holders, etc.  The atmosphere? Lovely. I loved the wall of candle and the couch we were on was super comfy. But it shouldn't take almost 3 hours to get something to eat (we were sat around 9, left at 10 till midnight), and the lack of caring from the hostess and service from the server earned this restaurant/wine bar one star...the second ever 1 star I've given.

We found this place based on Groupon, and thank goodness!  It was a little hard to find at night, tucked away in the back of a mostly dark shopping center. However, once we found it, we were seated right away in a cute place that wasn't too frou-frou, nor too relaxed. Perfect for a middle of the week date night.  The bruschetta was so so. I liked the caprese better than Postino's (although not a huge fan of the halved cherry tomatoes) and wasn't a huge fan of the tomato jam, although it wasn't bad.  We shared a small veggie salad - delicious! It was very different, with all sorts of tasty veggies in it. As a vegetarian, it's always nice to find *real* salads with lots of vegetables, instead of the oh-so-common lettuce/tomato/carrot combos.  The best part of the night? The pizza. Now, my partner is from NY, and so were my parents. Usually, I like NY pizza, the real stuff, the end. But when it comes to interesting topping combos, I'm happy to try wood burning oven pizza, and it was soooo worth it. The one we got had potatoes, leeks and gorgonzola on it. What with the apps, splitting one between the two of us was sufficient, but I wished we'd had more to take home.  The service was right on point - both our water and iced tea glasses were always full, our server had excellent suggestions when we asked for them, and we were left alone enough to have good conversation without feeling neglected. Win.  Would be go back? Most certainly!

This place is just down the street from my house, so we finally made our way over here to check it out, as my partner and I both love a good brunch.  I don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.  Once seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.  Yeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.  When it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.  I stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my "meal."  Add to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant.

My lovely partner brought me here on a surprise date.  Yes, the drive was a little far, but the weather was nice, it was scenic and there wasn't much traffic.  Sadly, we missed the last tour and the wine tasting, but honestly, I don't feel like we missed out on much. We had a ton of fun tasting all the different oils, vinegars and spreads.  We had lunch there, and it was incredibly delicious. So much tasty, both for the meat sandwich (my partner) and the veggie pannini.  Plus the mushroom bruschetta was tasty. I grabbed some balsamic reduction to add on; delish!  On the way out, we bought way too much; pumpkin cupcakes (SO GOOD!), garlic oil, pomegranate white balsamic and a tasty loaf of bread. Oh! And asiago stuffed olives.  We've been trying to use them all sparingly, but they are so yummy that it is hard.  Guess we'll have to go back when we have out of town guests!

Color me impressed.  Given the quality of sushi restaurants in the greater Valley area, I was worried about conveyor belt sushi here. I mean, if they can't make it right in the kitchen, how is it gonna be on a roving belt?  My worries were for naught.  Despite the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 7:45pm (yes, it was that crowded), and having trouble finding it (there is no sign from the street -- you HAVE to know where it is), it was all worth it.  My companions (all fish eaters but me) LOVED it. They said the fish was fresh, delicious, exciting etc. I loved the seaweed salad and edamame to start, and then went for two dishes of Inari, a place of veggie rolls, and then wound up ordering 3 orders (so a total of 12 individual) avocado rolls, because none were coming around.  All that, plus iced tea, cost me $16.  AMAZING.  My partner ate all sorts of rolls; her favorite was the I Love Salmon Roll and also the Caterpillar Roll, although she enjoyed the Rainbow Roll and Dragon Rolls as well.  Wasn't impressed with the Las Vegas Roll, and wished that they had more exciting, different, unique rolls (they had one; the Haru Sushi, which she did enjoy).  Her total, with iced tea? $18. Seriously. Oh, and we shared a place of cream puffs for dessert.  There were no plates more than $2. The cheesecake had two $2 plates, making it 4, but other than that, nothing, including special orders, was more than $2.  The avocado rolls I had were some of the best I've enjoyed (they were bursting full of avocado, instead of one small piece), and the Inari was delicious. Ginger on the table (as well as unagi sauce and soy sauce), quick to fill up iced tea. I was in heaven.  I do wish they'd have more vegetarian rolls so I didn't have to order them. The whole time we were there, only one veggie roll went by - the one I ate.  No cucumber, avocado, daikon, etc unless you ordered them. I also wish Wasabi was on the table, instead of brought to you in a hunk; I didn't want to use it all at once, but I had to take it out of my dish to save for later and put...where?  Also, I loved the "other" options, like juice, V8, Ramun (Japanese soda), pudding cups, fruit, cheesecake and more on the belt. Gave lots of options.  It did take forever to get our bill, but all that aside, we will most definitely be back.

This was another Groupon find of mine, although I had heard about it (in a not so good light) from a friend. However, I do love me some Indian food, so I grabbed my partner and headed over there.  The Groupon was for $40, and at most places, if get get apps, food, dessert and iced tea, we hit that mark. Not here. We each order the fanciest Thali they had (comes with salad, naan, biranyi rice, desser, chai, mini mango lassis, dal and two veggie dishes), but they were only $15 a piece, so we wound up ordering two more starters (the potato pancake Chaat and fried Paneer) in order to hit our price point. And then we took a LOT of food home.  The mango lassis were delicious, as was the salad.  I wasn't such a fan of the chaat - it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy. I loved the fried Paneer, but who doesn't love fried cheese? It was great with the tamarind chutney.  As far as the main meal, I loved everything (though next time, will go with plain basmati rice). I especially enjoyed the paneer tikka masala and the malai kofta, my favorite dish ever. The dal was good -- I've never seen kidney beans in it before, but I liked it. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the Saag Paneer - the texture was too smooth. However, my partner scarfed it down.  For dessert, I was expecting rice pudding, or the sweet balls. Instead, our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge. We hadn't, so she brought that out.  I liked it, except for the sultana raisins (I hate raisins). It didn't hit the spot for my partner though, and the chai wasn't as strongly spiced as I like (plus I prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it).  We'll be back, for sure. I might go with a small thali, but it's a really good deal, and an excellent amount of good food for the value. Glad I found it!

After seeing a bunch of two star reviews from my friends, I was hesitant about going, but I'm glad I finally did.    From start to finish, the service was friendly.  The hostesses were chatty (but not too much) and super nice, and my waiter was polite, checked in on my, had good recommendations, etc.  The food and drink? Ridiculously pricey. Yes. Tasty though? Also yes.  I had the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza, a combo I wouldn't have thought of putting on a pizza, yet it was delicious.  The Nojito to drink? It was ok, but not really worth $4, especially with no refills.  I loved that they had the menu marked vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. That is always much appreciated.    The atmosphere was nice, although my chair wasn't super comfy. Bathrooms were nicely designed, but not cleaned while I was in them.  I did love that you could see all the food being prepared in an open environment.  I won't be back until we're ready for a fancy date night, but I'll definitely be bringing my partner here to try some of the delicious options!

Dianne is amazing. AH MAY ZING.  You have no idea the absolute amazingness and awesomeness that come out of her brush. From a black/red biker chick rose on my bicep to a crab fighting a shark on a small child to an out of this world T-rex on my friend's cheek, she does some of the best freehand facepainting I have ever seen.  Not only that, but she has an excellent presence, and is sweet, kind, and good with both adults and children. Plus, she had glitter!  I was incredibly impressed with her, and wished that I was having my wedding in AZ. If so, I'd definitely hire her to add a little sparkle (pun totally intended) to our special day.

Keeping in mind I'm new to this whole Frozen Yogurt (fro-yo, if you will) shebang, MoJo was my first entrance into the world of awesome.  Um, fresh mango? Lychee nuts? Tart raspberry frozen yogurt? When does the amazingness end?  Yes, they are a little more expensive than some of the competitors, and I found the acoustics to be a little too loud when my friends and I wanted to sit down and chat.    However, all that aside, they had great flavor options, a line that moved quickly, and I love that they have the little sample cups out and easily accessible to try all the flavors. Tres cool in my book.  The tart yogurts got a little too tart for me after a while, but I guess that just means they are doing their job.  My partner got more traditional flavors, and had no issue scarfing it down, where as my tart yogurt and fruit concoction wound up being a little much.  Overall, definitely a yums up!

I had been to the Mojo on Mill, however, I'd never tired this one.  It had far less flavor options than on Mill, but they had not one, not two, but THREE flavors of mochi and a whole ton a great fresh fruit. I was quite satisfied by the topping selection; if anything, there were too many options!  However, what bumps this three star review up to four was the beanie wearing guy at the counter. He was interesting, friendly, and he actually seemed to care about my responses.  Not only that, but I've been to Mojo a ton of times, and no one ever offered me a punch card. He did, and even gave me an extra punch. Service here definitely made the visit!

Thank goodness for Living Social, or I might never have discovered this place.  As a vegetarian, this was my hog heaven...minus the hog. I mean, I could literally order anything I wanted and would be sure that there wasn't an accidental chicken stock action, or that pork might show up towards the bottom of the bowl.  I also really really loved that they offer both Northern and Southern options -- dosas AND curries!  I went on a Saturday night with my partner and a friend.  For $40, we got 2 starters, a dosa combo plate, a thali, iced tea and a mango lassi...and we took home 3 dosas, naan, and a few other things. Great pricing and lots of food for your buck. Most of the food was absolutely amazing, although I found it to be heavy on the onions (not a huge fan) and some of it to be too spicy.  As far as the negative? The service was awful. When someone came by, they were super friendly...all 4 times through out the meal. It took us two hours to order, eat and pay...waiting for the check took almost 30 minutes on its own. My partner's iced tea was empty for the majority of the meal. Also, not an issue for us, but the vegan items weren't marked, which would have been a problem if any one was vegan.  The food and pricing gets 5 stars. The service gets 2.5. Overall, a 4, and I'll have to go back for the buffet at some point, when I get to provide my OWN service!

I've only recently discovered this huge trend of "fro-yo" having just moved out to Phoenix, and dear god is this place delicious.  It's cheaper than some of the other places (*coughs* Mojo) and it has really great and varied toppings, from fruit to nuts and everything in between. Plus, they have a great variety of flavors (I've love the Taro, Pistachio and NY Cheesecake while my partner prefers their Coffee), including some low fat and no fat options.  So good prices, good yogurt, and good toppings? Could they have any downfalls? They had a HUGE line, making it almost not worth the wait, especially since they only had once cashier and didn't seem to know how to keep it moving.  Plus, they don't have sample cups out -- you have to ask for them, which is really difficult when the line is epic.  Otherwise, loved it, and will definitely be back!

Not *the* most amazing buffet I've been to, and the line is a little out of control, but it's pretty good...for an omnivore. Now, I'm a vegetarian, and chilled mostly at the nacho bar and mongolian wok, since pretty much everything else had meat it it. However, my partner isn't veggie, and she had a blast, trying a plate of this and that. Her verdict is that the Chinese food is delish, the Italian could use some help and everything else was tasty, but not amazing.  Our service was great, with quick drink refills and plate clearing. I personally was disappointed in the dessert section, as that is what I was saving room for, and found that most of the desserts where too dry, too sweet, or tasted wrong. That said, the little shooters of tapioca and tiramisu were absolutely fabulous.  I might come back, but when they're having the lower prices; for a vegetarian, it isn't worth the super high regular cost.

I didn't realize that this place was done by the same folks as Humble Pie before we arrived, but both places get a solid 4 stars. We originally saw 5th and Wine at March's Yelp event at the Desert Botanical Gardens, and when I was reminded of it by Groupon, we had to make our way in.  The place is ADORABLE. Period. We talked about how perhaps we might one day decorate our house like this (minus the dog pictures) -- the red chairs, dark wood tables, mini library and awesome lights? Check.  The menu was good, but not amazing, as I'm a vegetarian. My options here were about on par compared with Postino's...except here I could get 6 bruschetta if I wanted, Postino's only 4. However, there were only 4 vegetarian bruschetta offerings, so that's what I got. The hummus was a little too spicy, the caprese was good (although I'd prefer sliced rather than cherry tomatoes), the tomato jam was so so. The real star of the plate was the apples, agave, fig jam and brie. Best sweet bruschetta I've had in the valley!  We shared fried pickles. I love me some good fried pickles. These were ok, but not crispy enough. I did like, however, that they used thin slices instead of thick ones (Grand Lux Cafe) or spears (Gunther Toody's).  My partner got the prosciutto pannini.  She liked it, but said it helped her to realize that she preferred that flavor combo cold.  Salad that came with was great.  Our service was super, with our iced teas and waters getting constant water refills (plus I loved the water carafe of sorts on the table).   All in all, it's a cute neighborhood, and we'll be back to try different menu items, enjoy the service, and check out their delicious looking drink menu!

Love love love this place.  Wound up getting a Groupon to here a few weeks ago, as we love to cook with infused oils and flavored vinegars. I tried to stop by after work one day, but they close promptly at 6. My disappointment? Huge.  However, it was worth the wait. We went in this weekend, and were floored by the friendly customer service, the varieties of both oils and vinegars, and pleased by the ability to taste each variety. I loved the vanilla and fig balsamic, and we were hard pressed (no pun intended) to decided between the wild mushroom/sage, tuscon herb, basil and garlic olive oils. We ended up with the wild mushroom oil, and it's really added some excellent flavors to our food.  Guess it's time to start saving up so we can come back and buy one of each flavor!

They advertise a $15.95 oil change, 32 point inspection and tire rotation on their sign, so when my partner was out of town, I took her Pontiac Vibe in for a little love.  Even though I was a walk in, they still got it taken care of in about half an hour. They were efficient, friendly, did a good job with the car, and I'd definitely go back. With disposal fees and tax, it came to a little over $20, but for all that I got, you just can't beat the price.  However, the waiting area could use some love. Luckily, I live nearby, and just walked home to wait.

Christie was warm, friendly, and most importantly, a great stylist. She listened to what I wanted (which rarely happens), did a fabulous job with my curly hair (again, quite rare), charges a reasonable amount (hard to find in the East valley, and is LGBTQ friendly, making her my new go-to stylist to recommend to people. Additionally, her salon is clean, well kept, with easy (and free) parking, and nearby other shopping, eateries, etc. I only cut my hair twice a year or so, but I know I'll be back!

Similar to Chipotle, Qdoba and the rest of that ilk, Rubios is a quick service Mexican restaurant, that, in addition to burritos, offers enchiladas, fish tacos, and more.  Think Baja Fresh, but with more options and a bit more delicious.   Prices were good, the service was great (they offered to fresh cook me just mushrooms and peppers with no onions), and the food was out fairly quickly.  They have a salsa bar with mild yet delicious chipotle salsa and salsa verde, and it's all you can salsa (if you take it to go, they have to go cups as well).  Food was good.  Not quite amazing, and I personally prefer Chipotle, but Rubio's is definitely delicious and was worth a stop on the way from Phoenix to Tucson.  I'll be keeping my eyes open for more in Phoenix.

Keep in mind that I haven't actually picked up my glasses yet, but...  This was the best glasses shopping experience of my life. The doctor was nice, open minded, friendly, and explained everything to me, something I've never had another doctor do. I loved to hear about why each test was done, which ones were risk assessments, etc.  Great "bedside" manner.  The woman who helped me order my glasses was incredibly patient, and helpful, as well as knew about lots of different options.  Add to that the receptionist who knew her stuff too, and was super sweet and helpful in helping me choose my frames.  I'm recommending this place to my partner, and any one who will listen. What a great experience!

I was actually pretty damn impressed with this place.  I was looking for an engagement bracelet with my partner (don't laugh; I don't really like rings, so will save that for the actual thing), and was getting discouraged. Everyone either had the bracelet I liked but with the wrong clasp, or had another I liked for an outrageous price. Royal Palace had the bracelet I like, came down to an AMAZING price, and changed the clasp for me while I waited. How's that for service?  They have an amazing selection of all sorts of jewelry (including some beautiful Stars of David; I may be back for the holidays!), and most of it was quite reasonably priced. My partner said she'll be back to get me matching earrings or a necklace for our anniversary :)  Worth checking out!

We just moved here last November, and one of our beloved kitties got a UTI.  Being new, we didn't know where to take him, but I'd been to a Banfield in Denver, and was really happy.  We were definitely not disappointed. Friendly staff greeted us, and even though we got there a bit early, we were put in a room quickly.    The doctor was nice, understanding, and didn't push all sorts of medical procedures on us like some vets do.  He gave us multiple solutions we could try, and let us pick which one we wanted to try.  With the antibiotics, new food and an extra litter box, Jasper was feeling better in no time.  Plus they called two days later to check how he was feeling. They definitely showed us that they cared for animals and weren't just in it for a buck.

I went to the VIP Sneak Peak last night, and honestly, I wish I'd stayed home.  Yes.  I am a vegetarian, but my partner isn't, and she loves hamburgers, so I figured this would be a perfect way to show my love.  We didn't have to wait long for a booth, but ended up with one by the door that was absolutely FREEZING. We both had jackets on and were still shivering.  We went up in the line to order; she got an all american burger and smashfries.  I planned to get Smashfries, a side salad w/ no onions and a cactus vanilla shake. My friend had the veggie frites, and said they were awful, so I decided not to go that directions.  Apparently, the salads are pre made, and there is no way to get them without onions. I asked if maybe they were whole onions I could just take off. No, they were chopped.  Ok. Since they don't have ANY other veggie options (no veggie burger, no grilled cheese, no vegetarian full sized salad), I asked the cashier what she recommended for a vegetarian.  She told me this was not place for a vegetarian.  Was I offended? Yes.  While *I* am a vegetarian, my partner is not. We like to go to dinner together, and they've now lost both of our business.  Finally, I wound up spending 5 minutes negotiating with her to try and have an arizona cobb salad made without chicken, bacon, onions or jalapenos. She finally figured it out, and we went to go wait.  The wait was maybe 10 minutes, and then out came out food. The vanilla cactus shake tasted like a regular vanilla shake; nothing special.  The Smashfries were actually pretty good; I liked their seasoning...but Delux's sweet potato fries beat them any day.  And my salad? HA.  It was a GIANT bowl only half filled...with chopped iceburg, a hint of cheese, a few pieces of tomatoes, and less than a teaspoon of guacamole. I wish I had taken a picture, it was that ridiculous.  Plus, there were brown pieces of lettuce and the bases (the bottom of the lettuce that is hard and dirty) mixed in there. Sigh. And yes, even without any meat, it cost $6.99  I asked my partner about her burger.  She said it was "ok."  I asked her to compare it.  She said it was worse than Red Robin, worse than Chili's, on par with Sonic and slightly better than Burger King. Ouch. That's a lot of money to pay for a burger on par with Sonic.  She did finish the burger, but didn't like the fries.  Will we be back? No.  The food is over price for a mediocre meal, and they have made it very clear that "my kind" (vegetarians) and their friends/partners are not welcome.

Again, we've been on an epic sushi expedition since moving here, trying to find GOOD sushi in Phoenix.  So far, the best has been Sushi on Shea in Scottsdale. However, friends recommended Stingray, so off we went.  Now, we are definitely not this trendy. No Sir.  We felt quite a bit out of place, and while I did like most of the decor (walking over fish looking up my skirt was a bit awkward), some of it was too much. Also, the hostesses wore nothing to differentiate them; it was like being in the emo-ville section of ASU.  Stepping in, we waited a good 5 minutes before we were sat. Once sat, our server took her time coming over too. Between the initial service and the prices, we were pretty unimpressed. Also, the lack of vegetarian sushi options was kind of disappointing.  However, the food, once ordered, was delicious. The iced tea was super tasty, and my partner got a crunchy roll and a spicy salmon roll.  She said both were the freshest she's tasted since we moved here.  Due to the lack of veggie-friendly sushi options, I opted for the Udon soup with a soy broth. Granted, it came out about 10 minutes after my partner's sushi did, but it was worth it. Veggies, noodles and a DELICIOUS broth made it well worth the $12, and I was definitely full.  Will we come back? Yes, but not too frequently. The pricing is a bit high, and we're way too un-trendy for such a place, so Sushi on Shea will be our go to, affordable place. However, for a once in a while date night sushi place, Stingray will top the list.

It's always nice to stumble across a locally owned coffeeshop, and this one is no exception. Not only that, but it's all organic, a place after my own Colorado hippie heart. And if that wasn't enough, they have cupcakes!  Their chai was delicious (although presweetened, so those of you who like to put in your own agave are out of luck), and my partner enjoyed her iced latte, saying it tasted fresh. The made-there coffee cake was incredibly messy, but also incredibly delicious.  I like the decor; great artwork, soothing colors, some chairs/tables and some comfy chairs, and great music that we really enjoyed. I love the easy to access free wireless as well. I can't stand places that charge at this point in my life. I'm no trendy college student.  Prices are good for drinks, but seem a little high for the food items, especially the wraps.  The owner was super nice, but didn't seem to "get it" when I spoke to him about gender neutral bathrooms, which are of importance to me, my partner, and queer friendly groups I would love to have meet here in the future.  I'm hoping he'll change the two single stall rooms to be gender neutral -- eliminate lines, and make everyone feel welcome.  I'll be back, for sure. I have to try the cupcakes!

I love love love Ticoz, enjoy Switch, and am still out with the jury on Fez. Ergo, when there was another restaurant opening, my partner and I were so there.  We went with another set of queer folk, and one thing I love about all these places is that there isn't any anti-gay rudeness that I've experienced in a good number of other places.  The menu is a bit sparse, and pretty much everything vegetarian (all 4 items) was fried, covered in cheese, or both, making for a not so healthy meal. That said, my eggplant/goat cheese sandwich was delicious (although I'm not sure about the iceberg lettuce and onion on it). The fries we ordered as a group? Mediocre. Would go with Delux's fries any day over these.  The rest of the group (the non-veggies) loved their meal (burgers and the fish), except my partner thought the pretzel bun was a bit off, and neither burger eater finished the bun.  They were not yet serving desserts, so I went for a drink. The waiter (Able, great with the service) suggested I try the naked (low calorie) Brooklyn Apple. I did, we all tasted it, and sent it back. It taste like fake sugar and fake apple flavor. However, the naked Vodka-rita was delicious.  Atmosphere? Loved it. Music? AH-MAY-ZING. Parking? Couldn't find it. Add a few more veggie options, and we'll definitely be back.
