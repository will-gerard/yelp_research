You would never think of going here by the looks. Super run down & bland looking. I would almost think it wasn't open. But the food was great. I was not expecting to have an amazing chimichanga here. Apparently they've been there for 10 years!

First time here. I ate the club wrap... lunch meat... hard to find... goofy music. (PS I did not go here recently.. this was old review from 2011 or 12)

I call in early so I can eat quick.. because I'm hungry.. and I need to get out quick. I get in, pay. Then I sit reading for 30-45 minutes and finally realize it's been way too long and ask what the deal is. The terd who took my order was apparently completely out of it and was twiddling his thumbs while my order he took sat right next to him. All of the times I've been there it seems to take quite a bit longer than expected.  There wings are great but this really annoyed me. They get a one star for now.
