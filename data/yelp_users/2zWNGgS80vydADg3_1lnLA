If your love seafood and are craving mexican food, this place is it! Don't let the outside or surrounding buildings intimidate you. The food is well worth the trip!  With free chips and salsa and also a delicious free bit of their ceviche while you order and wait, ya really can't go wrong! Its a bit small inside but perfectly sized for a nice peaceful meal without the room full of loud customes that normally comes with a great restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the mood is colorfully relaxing. I live in E. Mesa and its even worth the drive! :-)

First off, the place is actually called, "New Golden China", and don't waste your time here! They never actually have anyone that speaks clear or decent English taking orders. Though I suppose if you're looking for that extreme authenticity in Chinese food. . . Anyway, on top of that,  out of the three times we've ordered from there, the food is only ok and tends to be on the greasy side.  Then, this last time we ordered, we were promised that the food would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour. It arrived almost 90 minutes after it was ordered, and was completely someone else's order!  Our choices at that point, promised from the Mgr was too get it completely remade, which would take another 45 minutes to an hour! So was able to convey with the partially literate employee that I did not want that and had to argue to get a full refund, which I did finally get.

Coffee is pretty good, and the prices are pretty decent. The place reminds me of an old hole in the wall beatnik coffee house I spent a lot of my highschool and college years in.   I was in there after midnight on a Saturday night, and the atmosphere was pretty relaxing and quiet. Great for when ya need to finish that report or cram for a test.   There's indoor seating, outdoor seating, wifi, private study pods yet they also have a set up for a live band and a drive through for when your on the go. Definately a place that's worth checking out

The pizzas here are delicious. It might not be as great as anything from the east coast but I don't know about that. I've never been there. As for  being in the east valley of Az, its pretty damn great. The ingredients are fresh and the dough is authentically hands tossed.  Everytime I come, the service is friendly. The price is a tad bit on the higher side but these pizzas definately aren't some $5 pizzas from dominos.  If you're ever in the east valley or Apache Junction area, ya might considered trying Ray's.

"Freaky fast" indeed. Its right by my current jobsite and I only have half an hour for my lunch.  This sub shop is always speedy, and their sandwiches are still always made as if they took their time.  Its always clean, the employees are always in great spirits, and they always have great music of all different genres playing that help me forget about work for my brief getaway. If you're in a crunch for time near this place and a sandwich sounds good, this place is great.

We stopped into the Chandler location for dinner on a Monday evening and it was nice and quiet. I'm told on the weekends, there is a waiting list. We ordered a large pie and it was indeed pretty delicious.  The hostess was very friendly, staff was wonderful, and Frank was a great character! A true East Coaster. The decor was great! Definitely feels like you've left Arizona when you set foot inside.  If you're from back east or would like an experience without travelling far, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is definitely somewhere to try.

We stopped in for a Saturday breakfast and this place really hit the spot. The Saturday crowd wasn't too bad but was much like the normal Denny's and IHOP crowd. The restaurant was originally a coffee house so that's the vibe that we got.  The menu was actually pretty wide and I got the meat lover's scramble. It was really delicious, the service was right on and very warm and friendly. Prices are pretty decent also. Apparently this restaurant has a few other locations also. If you're hungry for some decent portions of breakfast I would definitely recommend Biscuits.
