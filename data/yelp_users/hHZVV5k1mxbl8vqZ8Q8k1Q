This store lost my package. I go in to get things figured out, the guy working there who barely speaks English didn't help much. Let me know my package was lost and I have to come back to see the owner at a time that is only convenient for him. Now I have to rearrange my schedule to suit the owner because " he will not answer his phone on Saturday" this is place is unprofessional as they come. Do yourself a favor and stay out of this dump.

Very bad experience here. Paid for a $23 wash and they gave me the most basic wash, the attendant wrote the wrong code on my window. My black vehicle looked horrible after going through their wash, drip marks and dirt on the hood, doors and windows. After I asked why my truck was still dirty after paying $23 They attempted to wipe it down better and it still looks dirty. I'll never consider going here again.

I went in at 10:30 am hoping to try out a new to me local coffee shop, I'd much rather support a small shop than a mainstream place. I waited almost 10 minutes at the counter while I could overhear 2 people arguing over dishes and other duties that weren't getting done. I had to leave as I was tired of hearing the argument and can't wait 15 minutes to get a latte, no one ever came out to help me. Wish I could have experienced the great reviews others gave.

With a name like Chronic Tacos, you'd think this place would serve some bomb tacos, they don't. They should change the name to seedy brick weed tacos.   Nothing was fresh, tortillas were cold, tacos are way over priced and the staff was poorly trained. Management here must be non existent, no one knows what the other person is doing and there is no type of order at all. Had high expectations that were quickly let down.

Giving this place 5 stars is a no brainer! I can confidently say this is the most amazing breakfast I've had in the valley!   I had the Arepas, which is something I've never heard of and it was to die for. Eggs with chorizo, sausage, giant beans and more. So so good.  Staff is friendly, small kitchen and very personable, I thanked the chef in person on the way out for the amazing experience! Very welcoming environment!  I will certainly be back.

Service was outstanding and the food was delicious. The enchiladas and tacos are phenomenal. Would recommend a visit!
