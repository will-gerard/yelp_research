I feel kind of bad giving out my first 1-star review, but hopefully I'll go back and give it another review.  I got a menu from this place in some flier and it's been on my fridge taunting me for the past week or so.  I finally got the pizza craving, and it was conveniently on a Friday when Rosati's offers double coupons, turning a $5 off an order of $20 or more into $10 off.  Definitely not bad, because I think they're a little over-priced and without the coupon/double coupon incentive wouldn't go back. Anyway, I wasn't surprised that we weren't the only ones wanting pizza on a Friday and had no problem with the 1 hour delivery time quoted for my pizza and salad.  An hour and a half later, the guy shows up with the pizza and no salad.  He won't just say screw it to the salad and adjust the bill because then we're under the necessary $20 mark for the coupon, but he says he'll be right back and it won't take nearly as long as the pizza did.  We settled into the pizza, which turned out to be cold around the edges and lukewarm in the middle, and really soggy.  Not soggy like the thin crust was buckling under the weight of the toppings (though probably that too), but soggy like the crust was sitting under wet toppings for way too long and it just turned into mush.  Still, it was fairly tasty for cold and soggy and I could see the potential for a decent pizza.  After 45 minutes there's no salad so we call and ask if it could just be canceled.  She says he's already on the way, so no, but offers us coupons.  I'm guessing more coupons that just came with the pizza.  we explain the shiteous experience and she doesn't sound surprised but doesn't offer to right the situation in anyway either.  Finally the guy came with the salad a little over an hour after his first visit and just under 3 hours after we ordered.  We weren't hungry at that point, but I had the salad the next day for lunch, with leftover pizza crisped up in the oven.  Both were decent. I emailed Rosati's with what I wrote here because I'm honestly not used to this crappy of service.  If they contact me, I'll try them again and redo this review.  If you're reading this, I guess they haven't yet. Bottom line:  Probably good pizza, but there's a catch-22 of being overpriced without coupons and overly busy when coupons are offered.  My advice would be to order in or carry out.

The boyfriend and I found this place whilst driving around last night, hungry enough to be a little snappish but not so hungry that we just said 'screw it' and made a beeline to the closest (and only okay) tacqueria to our house.  Before even getting to the food, I have to say this place earns five stars for the customer service.  No sexy taco girls were working last night (though I did see the family photo on the wall and say Damn!), but as we walked in the door we were welcomed with exuberant hellos and Happy New Years! greetings.  They were really, REALLY happy to see us, or they put on a really convincing show of it.  The cook came from the back to say hi and tell us what's good (everything- I don't think he was lying), the guy in front was excited to tell us about the family that owned the place and the type of food they serve.  They demanded we take some chips and salsa on the house and I'm glad they did- the tortilla chips were freshly fried with that lovely salty, greasy taste without the texture being greasy.  The tortilla equivalent of the best kettle chips.  We left feeling giddy and happy and really fricken excited to get home and eat. Now, the actual food.  We each got a burrito and the boyfriend also got a cheese quesadilla.  Along with the complimentary chips, this was a ridiculous amount of food.  The burrito-forearm comparison doesn't really give these burritos justice.  If my forearm were that size, and I were a guy... well, there's no doubt what I spent all my time doing (possibly thinking about these taco girls?).  The guy asks you what you want on it and wraps the burrito in front of you- I was amazed he could actually close up the burrito!  Also, I'm happy to report that despite the size this is the first place in the valley I've found that wraps their burritos tight enough that they stay erect (what's up with the sex innuendo in this post?) and don't fall apart mid-scarf.  My only complaint is that they were so big and loaded it's hard to tell what type it's supposed to be.  I ordered fish with the knowledge that I wanted to taste fish, cabbage, lime juice, sauce, and a little whatever to fill the sucker out.  Instead I got a kitchen sink concoction that tasted delicious but not really any different from the boyfriend's carne asada burrito.  If I went back I'd probably get some tacos or their delicious, grilled, non-greasy quesadillas.  (Unless I'm starving and just want an ambiguous metric ton of deliciousness.)  I'm actually really excited to go back to try their tacos as the taste of the quesadilla transported me straight to dreamy, drunk nights in Mexico.  Mmmm grill flavor. The prices were slightly higher than other places I've been- maybe a buck more per burrito, but it's definitely made up for in quantity, taste, structural integrity of the burrito, and customer service.  I will definitely drive the extra distance and pay the extra dollar when I need a Mexican fast-food fix.

I like Paseo Trail Park a bit more, but I really love Shawnee.  The main reason I don't go to this one as much anymore is that as it gets hotter everyone's regular times at the park get condensed into the early morning and late evening and there's this one douchey dog whose schedule started coinciding more and more with my own.  I've noticed several Shawnee converts and it all comes down to the same name: Nina.  But enough about my internet smear campaign on a dog. Shawnee plusses: Mostly great owners- people I thoroughly enjoy talking to and who do well keeping an eye on their pets.  I really like the agility area, which Paseo Trail doesn't have, and how the park is broken up into different areas so dogs can run laps around it if they want or you can find a less populated area to chill and let a less active/socialized dog get used to the atmosphere.  There are two entrances too, which is again nice if you want to let an excitable or shy dog get acclimated before being approached by other dogs.  Lots of shade and areas to sit, and the place is pretty clean.  I never notice an odor when I walk in and most people clean up after their pets. The negatives: A lot of dirt.  The grass has a hard time with constant traffic. Paseo has two areas that are alternated to let the grass recover, which is nice.  The hours aren't amazing but I consider it a fair compromise with houses nearby.  Also it's really quiet most the time outside evenings and weekends, even when the weather was cooler, which is probably nice for some but for me I'm going for my dog to play and socialize so I like how at Paseo you can pretty much always count on a good crowd. A last note on dog parks in general. I recently moved to the area and haven't had a lot of luck meeting people outside of work.  I really love the people I've met here as well as other parks and, having never lived anywhere with dog parks around, really consider it one of many assets to living in Chandler. (That and Cho-Dang and the flammable pile of tumbleweeds we call a Christmas tree.) Overall I really nice, well-run park.

My grocery list invariably reads something like this:  A buttload of various meats and cuts usually based on what's for sale, a ridiculous amount of eggs, a crapload of a bunch of different types of vegetables, the occasional staple or dairy product. The meat here is decent and priced fine, as are staples and such.   Their prepackaged veggies don't have the prices or variety to really suit my needs but they're okay in a pinch.  The bagged salads are better priced than most places.  The bf likes coming here because his creamer is always on sale and only likes their strawberry yoghurt.  I like coming here because when he gets crabby I can stuff one of their ever-present free samples into his mouth.   But the best reason by far to shop here is the clearance section.  Seriously, how freaking amazing is it that I can buy a whole roasting chicken for $1.42?  I like to go and buy up any decent looking clearance meat I see and put it straight into the freezer at home.  I sometimes get vegetables or try their premade salads and such (all good so far) from the clearance section if I know they'll be used soon.  This reason alone is why I freaking love this place. I kinda wish I didn't tell you about the clearance section.  I already have enough competition from crazy old ladies that seem to hover there all day waiting for a salesperson to put something in there.

I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals. Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.

A solid 3.5.  I thought of rounding down because the bill surprised me a little, but the service won out in the end. I was expecting a Native New Yorker-type place so I was flustered when I saw the extensive beer list- I quickly ordered something the waitress just told me they were out of, then changed it to just a Blue Moon, then asked what stouts she recommended before settling on... a pear cider.  Then I sat and pouted as I read over all the other beers I should have ordered instead, daring not change my order yet again and confirm all suspicions that I'm a jackass.  Fortunately, the inner turmoil was quelled when the drinks came- the cider was excellent. The boyfriend and I ordered 10 wings, a burger for him, and a patty melt for me.  The wings were great- I never order boneless so was surprised to basically get chicken strips, but juicy nuggets of meat with a crisp, sauce-basted exterior works for me.  The boyfriend said his burger was great and I thought the patty melt was just about perfect.  My only complaint was that the grilled onions were just this side of raw, but it's not stopping my mouth from watering thinking about the leftovers currently sitting in my fridge.  His fries seemed average but my chips were great, though not hot which is nice for homemade.  10 wings, 2 beers, and 2 sandwiches came to just under $40 before tip, but this was a Saturday night with no specials, not the usual circumstances under which I frequent wing joints. Next time I'd try to go during a happy hour, but I can definitely see a next time.

I'm a girl so this review may not be as useful as it could be.  Nonetheless, the bf needed a haircut and we were in the area so this is where we went.  Definitely a guy's place- all employees were pretty girls in short skirts/shorts that flirted shamelessly with the men whose hair they were cutting,  Maxim in the waiting area, personal TVs tuned into ESPN at each hair station.  I got the feeling it wasn't often a girl customer was present, even just waiting, but everyone was pleasant even as they fawned over my bf.   The prices seemed good.  Don't quote me, but I think a basic cut was about $15 and there were options for a wash, head massage, shave with a straight-edge razor, etc.  The shampoos they use smell awesome and I was quite pleased with the bf's haircut.

Previously Dairy Queen, same owners, similar menu, just let the franchise drop. Nice people working here, but still basically DQ for better or for worse.
