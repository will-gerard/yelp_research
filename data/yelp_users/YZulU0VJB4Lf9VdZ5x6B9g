Rude cashier, I believe her name was Erin (short blond hair). We use this gas station, but dread having to go inside because the service is always so poor.

Every time I walk into the store the service at the register is the worst. One person they'll give a complimentary eye shadow (for your trouble) the next person they won't all the while they have a box filled with them behind the register. I go here when I'm pressed for time and I can't get to Sephora. Oh how I wish we had a Sephora in north Phoenix. Yes, ulta has coupons they all have exclusions. What's the point!!!?

Enjoyed a yummy lunch and had great great service by Kirk. He recommended the Costa Rican Tilapia and I'm so happy he did because it was delicious.  It was busy, but the service was so great by everyone that it didn't affect our experience.

I'm so dissapointed!! I had to wait a day to cool off. My family has been seeing Drs Justin & Michelle since our move from San Diego (4+yrs) Although, I always felt like I was being sold when it came to frames Drs Justin & Michelle have always been amazing and know what they are doing. Unfortunately, my experience yesterday was "the straw that broke the camels back"  with the office staff. My sons glasses broke. I scheduled an appointment and since he couldn't see very well and back in school I asked to be put on the cancelation call list. An appointment cancelled I accepted the date & time of 9am. 20min before my sons appointment I called (8:40am). I believe I spoke with Tricia. I let her know I was running late & I would be 5-10min late had to get my son checked out of school (I can't foresee traffic & office delays). She said "no problem we will see you then". We arrive running through the door at 9:19am and I was told he had to be rescheduled. I understand policy etc....what made me so upset was that I called 20min before my appointment to let them know I was going to be late (the appointment was very important) I was NOT aware of policy & I was NOT told or given a courtesy "if you are late 15min you will be rescheduled". I was told "I'm sorry. As you can see we are busy, but I'd be happy to reschedule you" no thank you. They lost 4 patients!!

I was referred by my previous optometrist due to some some issues with Iritis. The iritis was under control, but my vision was still off and very blurry. After Dr Levin examined my eyes......he informed me that I was actually dealing with really bad case of Dry Eyes. I started the regimen he prescribed to deal with it and within two days vision was back!!!! Every single person/staff I came in contact with was not only courteous, but I could feel they genuinely cared. Professional, polite, caring and clean office. Thank you to Dr Levin, Regina, Erik, & Sandy for such a great experience.

First time here. Service, icecream & cookies were superb. The vanilla milkshake did not taste creamy. Possibly due to the fact that skim milk was used to make it.

Cool atmosphere, games available jenga, uno etc.... Being our first time here we had questions, but the girl at the register was not very helpful nor was she friendly. We got a Taro (coconut milk flavor) w/pineapple and condensed milk topping it was ok sorta left an after taste. My friend got the Milk cream (vanilla flavor) w/strawberries and nutella topping...hers was yummy. It would be helpful to offer a sample to first timers.....

4years living in AZ looking for good Chinese food & I think we found it. First time here and this place is delish and the service is great. Jose was awesome!! The citrus chicken & veggie noodles were my favorite.

I was surprised to experience such great service with the place being as busy & packed due to MNF.  Despite the craziness we received good service. The buffalo chicken salad was delish!!!

Love this place!!! Food and service is always on point!!!! Marc, Aaron & Ty are always so friendly. Sunday nights are quite the treat with half off bottles of wine. Great ambience, homemade pasta, wood fired pizza not to mention their sangria.....this place is a must try!!!

Very disappointed!!! The service was horrible. The young guys behind the counter had no customer service skills whatsoever and were rude to the customers especially an elderly gentleman who was asking a question about his cocoloco. They completely ignored him.  I felt so bad. The items we ordered had more ice than ingredients.
