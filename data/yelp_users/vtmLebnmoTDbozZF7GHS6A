Went in for my regular order of a philly chicken pita and draft beer. Not sure what has changed, but for some reason placing my order and then getting my food took, what seemed to be, twice as long as usual. I know summer can be slow, but for us regulars, it's nice to know that when we stay loyal during tough times, that our restaurants also stay loyal to us customers by having adequate staff.   My food was good as usual but being there almost an hour to place and eat a simple order was a little long.   I'll be back I promise and hopefully so will the service level.

Great Pho, great drinks and great service. Definitely a place to check out when in Phoenix.
