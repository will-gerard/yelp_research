BOMB breakfast! We must have arrived at the perfect time because when we left there were people waiting on tables and chairs outside.  Great service and everything was authentic!

Truly as good as it gets.  Fast (even when extremely busy), cheap, and delicious. It looks like an absolute DIVE, but damn it if it's not some of the best mexican food in the state.

I remember it being much better a long, long time ago.

This place must have completely given up now that they are closing. The staff doesn't smile or provide good service and the kitchen staff has become a fan of serving cold food.  The salad tasted and smelled like it came from a bag. As well.  No joke, I have been served better food at chain restaurants like Texas Roadhouse.

Don't even bother. The beer guy somehow gets great, rare, craft beers but that is literally the only good thing about this place.  Bad food, the worst service from immature and unprofessional "food servers" and a genuinely bad vibe.  This place would be out of business in a week of it were in the East Valley or Phoenix.

Best beer in the East Valley, hands down. Some of the best food, as well.  I hated mustard until I tried their spicy mustard. True Story.

Good selection, terrible prices. Honestly, anyone who purchases beer here must not know it's less expensive literally anywhere else in he valley.  The 5 cent wine sale is awesome, so are the craft beer glasses, but that's about it. Their hours suck.

Probably my second favorite place in the valley after OHSO.  Awesome selection, decent food, service can be a little slow occasionally but still 5 stars.  I hear they have good breakfast during football games, but have yet to try it.

The bouncers are dickheads for no reasons. There are plenty of better places to go on Mill.

I gotta admit, the first time I came here I was not as impressed as the second time.  That was before I got the Grilled Italian, a game-changer of a sandwich.  It was a 50/50 shot I went to this place again instead of going to Firehouse Subs in the same plaza, which I knew would be good. Holy hell am I glad I went here instead!  The ten minutes I spent waiting for my sandwich didn't take too long because they had NBA on TNT playing on one of the TVs (I'm a huge fan of Sir Charles).  Those ten minutes were well worth the wait once the sandwich arrived. The sandwich had plenty of grilled onions and peppers which really helped. There were both sweet peppers and hot peppers with the Italian meats - AMAZING.  After this sandwich I can't even recall what I had the first time, but it was obviously inferior. If you love Italian sandwiches, this is the way to go!  I can't give it five stars because it's hard to give a place five stars. Especially when they play Katy Perry and other garbage over their speakers. Get real, Capriotti's.

If they had a better (craft) beer selection, this place would be exceptional.

The only thing holding this back from being a five star review is the bad service. Great beers on tap.

One of the best places/breweries in PHX. They let some of us home brewers have a "brew out" with the Brewpunks. Fretzy knew what was up! Top notch.

Five stars without a doubt. My favorite spot in the Valley.  They offer dog treats from their spent beer grains.  Their beer is mediocre, but the service and experience more than makes up for it. Plus, they let ASH members put their beer on tap. VERY friendly to home brewers, and that's what counts!  For me, this is Heaven.

This is a cool place and the inside is pretty nice. I will say that the interior is much nicer than any other brewery I have been to. The Pale Ale is Bush League, but the Nut Brown and Hefe were amazing.  The manager, David, was very knowledgeable.

I have not tried the food, but the bartenders are great and the service on the patio is good. They have great beer selection for a restaurant.  They also had a chalk board displaying what beers would be on tap next, which was a great way to lure me back!

What a joke. I thought Subway was stingy with their meats until I came here. Sandwich wasn't bad, but there was practically no meat or toppings on it.  I've heard the bbq sandwich is a lot better than the Italian, which I got.

Great beer selection, but that's about it.  Overpriced, poor service, and unbelievably small.  How did they expect to hype up an establishment called "World of Beers" in one of the biggest cities in the country (and right next to ASU) while operating in a building this small? Seriously?  They must have screwed up my order because the beer I ordered was definitely not the beer I received.  To their credit, I did go on opening week, and maybe it will be better in a few months. The first time I went was the day after it opened, and one more time on that weekend.   I would give it another shot, hopefully when it's not nearly as busy.

Run how a microbrewery should be run! Equipment on display. Limited, but decent food (minus the Irish Nachos...), attentive wait staff, good service with the staff being unapologetic for unanticipated demand in beers leading to limited beer choices. And, most importantly, a welcoming place you could call home.  What more could you want?

Some of the best selection, service, and prices around. They have some of the best craft beers and wines available in the state. The growler station is awesome, too. They constantly share on their facebook page the new selection and tasting they are having. Top notch!

Deep fried French toast. Nothing more need be said.  Actually, this review was a little short for Yelp's taste so I must blab on for some reason.  Get the French toast. It is deep fried and they call it "San Francisco style."  Again, deep fried French toast.

The service is extremely hit or miss.  The first time my girlfriend and I went here our server was great - everyone else ... the other 4 people who brought us something or sat us... were bad.  At first we were going to brunch down the street, but they were on an extremely long wait. Then we walked past Postino's and decided to try something new.  Our server was attentive, yet the chips and salsa were slow initially and for refills. The food was delivered by what seemed like a manager and she did not ask if we needed anything else or offer to refill our empty waters.  Great beers on tap, the tacos are very good, and the servers make up a little bit for the overall way too laid back service. The decor is nice and the location is great, but get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait.
