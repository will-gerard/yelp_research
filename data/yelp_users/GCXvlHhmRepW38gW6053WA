Hands down my favorite East Valley Restaurant.  The staff is always friendly and professional, the food is always delicious, the place is clean, and I love the vibe!   I can't get enough of their sweet potato salad, and the baked goods are amazing!

Rude, dirty, disgusting. My laundry is done washing for 10 seconds and the attendant removes them and throws it in a filthy cart. The neighboring load that's been done for 20? Untouched. Sorry, but she deserves to be fired.

I work near this Jamba Juice, and love to get a smoothie on my break or to substitute for a meal occasionally.    When I first started going here, they were great-Fast, friendly, and professional.  They made suggestions and reminded me I could add free boosts to my smoothies.  I was so thrilled I even bought a reusable cup to get 10% off of all future smoothies.   This place has gone substantially downhill in the past two months.  It seems grimey now when I go in, and really, who wants to consume something from a place that can't wipe the counters or mop the floors peridodically?  They have messed up my smoothie order the last three times.    Once, they accidentally poured my smoothie into a disposable cup, I said not to worry and I'd just take that, and they proceeded to pour in into my reusable cup...which only ended up 2/3 full.  So...where did the other $2 worth of smoothie go?  I raised my concern, and the man who made it just shrugged.  The next time, they forgot my discount, and when I asked they just said "oops, we'll get you next time."  Um...I bought your silly  cup, I don't think the 20 Cents you're ripping me off for is really helping you much. I let it go since I was running late for work.  This smoothie also wasn't blended well and I couldn't get much of it through my straw.  I had to use a spoon on the final 1/3 of my smoothie to get the fruit pieces and ice chunks.   On my last visit, the moron who took my order must've been drunk, disabled, or both.  She was completely perplexed by my order, which was straight off the menu.  I had to repeat it multiple times, and then she couldn't comprehend what size I wanted.  I showed her my cup, and she still had to call a colleague order to get it entered right.  She also refused to give me my discount, saying she didn't know how.  She didn't take my cup, and I needed to remind her twice I had a resuable cup.  She then asked "What should I do with this?" once it was in her hand.  They then poured the wrong smoothie in my cup.  I had to wait for four other smoothies to be made before mine was finally made, and mixed with the remains of the wrong smoothie they had poured in first.  (Yes, I did request they rinse the cup out, but they didn't.)  I called the store and left feedback on their survey after this last visit, yet I received no response, apology, or even a coupon for a discounted smoothie.    Love your products, Jamba Juice at Gilbert & Germain, but I can't justify spending my money somewhere that can't get simple products and basic customer relations right.

This is where I get my gourmet cupcake fix!  Love the cupcakes, lots of unique, delicious flavors!  The edible glitter just speaks to my inner girlie-girl and makes me happy!  The coffees are great- I calorie splurged and had a Spanish Latte on my last visit.  It was the perfect sweet-bitter combination!    I've only eaten breakfast here, but the menu looks great.   I love the atmosphere-very industrial meets antique meets country.  It can get a little loud, but I blame that on the rude people who don't watch their children and scream into their cell phones more than the business.    Staff has always been friendly and efficient!

We decides to check out San Felipe's to satisfy a fish taco craving. It always looked pretty busy having walked by on other occasions.  Since we were planning on seeing a movie, it seemed convenient.  We should've followed our instincts and turned around when we saw the skankily dressed and over made up waitresses smoking outside the back door.  We were given the option of inside, bar, or outside. We opted for outside, and loved the cell call service for when the table was ready. There was no mention or indication of there being a band on the patio.   The hostess put us on the same side of a sticky picnic table. We had to move a couple of smokers who were sitting on top of the table before we could sit down. Note, WE had to,the hostess did not. At that point we realized a band was about to start playing.  Luckily we were able to get prices and place a drink order before the screeching started.  The drinks and our appetizer of chips and salsa came quickly, but our waters did not.  The music was so loud we couldn't even focus on reading the menu.  We asked to be moved inside, and the waitress obliged. The hostess (also the manager?) came out to move us, and made it clear in her facial expressions that we were severely inconveniencing her. She took us inside, and I caught her rolling her eyes at a waitress as she re-seated us.   About 15 minutes later, we finally had a waitress approach us. During this time we had discussed dropping some money on the table and leaving, but we were too hungry and figured the experience could only get better from here.  We couldn't have been more wrong.  First request, the water we hadn't gotten yet.  We immediately placed our order, and it came out about 10 minutes later.  It was dropped by a surly food runner with zero personality. Water?  Still missing.  I was stuck sipping my weak margarita and by boyfriend had nearly finished his beer.  When we were halfway done with our lukewarm meals, the waitress came to check on us.  Was she carrying water?  Nope.  Finally she followed through on something and brought them.  During this time we were subjected to the horrible music coming in from outside.  I'm fairly certain the band's singer was both tone deaf and unable to keep a beat.  I have heard better music at last call in a backwoods karaoke bar.  The baja sauce was disgusting. It's basically watered down mayo with a little hot sauce mixed in.  I should've taken to heart their sign that said "if  the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards."  Well, we finished our meal and waited for our check....for nearly 25 minutes. Between the bad music, bad food, and bad service, we nearly left without paying. Its clear nobody would've noticed.  Since we have manners, I got up and asked the 4 waitresses standing around at the entry for our check, since our's was MIA. They scurried off, and I assumed they were finding her.  After ANOTHER 10 minutes, she finally showed up with the check.   AND she had the nerve to say "see you guys next time!" Never again.  Save your time, save your money, save your ear drums. Avoid San Felipe's Cantina.

We had a great lunch at Latitude Eight.  We were promptly seated, and had iced teas within moments.  Our waitress was great at refilling our glasses and being available.  Both of us decided on the Lunch Special for $11.50.  (Appetizer, Salad or Soup, Entree and Dessert.)   The spring rolls were fresh and had the perfect flavor and texture.  The Green Papaya salad was one of the best I've had, none of the creepy chemical flavor that some can have.  The light peanut-chili dressing on it was great.  I had the Yellow Curry for an entree, and it was good.  I'm not a big fan of super-spicy food, and this had a nice amount of kick. The veggies were obviously fresh, and everything was cooked well. Dessert was the cutest little fried banana "egg roll".   The proportions were good, and we both left feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  The decor was clean and modern... "Zen" if you will.  I would have liked our table to be a little bit cleaner, it felt like it hadn't been cleaned/santitzed after the last guests.  Overall it was a good experience, and I'll definitely be back.  We'd love to try the happy hour specials!

Great sandwiches on fresh bread.  I can't get enough of the Hub Deli.  Their friendly staff always greets me with a smile, and makes my sandwich just as I want it!  Even with my substitutions and modifications, they always get it right.  The fresh chocolate chip cookies are a great bonus!    The garlic sauce is more like a pesto, heavy on parsley and garlic.  It adds a great kick to the sandwiches!  The pepper sauce is spicy, but good!  I suggest getting it on the side to control the level on your sandwich.  The Hub's sandwiches are generously sized... If you're not fee;ing super hungry you could definitely share one!    The menu is simple but creative, and there's something for everyone.  If not, they'll adapt it for you.

This is hands down my favorite bar in the East Valley.  It has a hip atmosphere, but isn't pretentious.  Whether you're sitting at the inside bar, the outside bar, or at a table, you're sure to have a great experience.   The place is always clean, the staff is always friendly, the service is always fast, and the food is always delicious.  Mixed drinks are strong, and tap beer is served at the right temperature. Although I haven't ordered wine there, the list is long enough that there's something for every taste.  The burgers are unique and delicious and the cooks actually cook them to the done-ness you request.  Love, Love, Love their sweet potato fries!  The chicken pot pie calzone is comfort food to the next level.  Margarita pizza-well, it's hands down the best I've ever had.  It's obviously made fresh, and has the perfect amount of garlic.  Staff is conversational, and usually other guests are too.  It's been great for date night, great for happy hour with the girls, great for lunch with friends, great for dinner...    Though, I must admit happy hour with the girls was the best because we appreciate the looks of the hottie bartender!  Don't worry gents, they hire far more cute girls than beefy guys. :) On the happy hour note, the prices are great... $3 Drafts, $5 Wines, Discounted appetizers...  Good for the budget and good for the spirit and good for the belly!   I highly recommend the Public House Garage!

Atmosphere...Dirty. Tacky. Poorly Lit.  They had half of the restaurant closed...but for no apparent reason.   Service...mediocre, at best.  The bus boy and bartender were great, our waitress was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  We had to ask three times for silverware.  Seating...We had a party of 7, and were sat at a table that was meant to seat 4.  They added extra chairs, but never thought to push an extra table up, even though they weren't even remotely busy.  Drinks...Good.  Strong and tasty.   Food...Spicy but cliche.  Nothing that really sets them apart, adding some extra chiles does not an amazing meal make.  The "fresh" chips were burnt and rancid.   I've had better food with exponentially better service nearly everywhere else. I doubt I'll be back, especially not to this location.
