I freaking love this place. I went for the first time with a group 2 months ago and every time anyone suggest meeting for dinner or lunch I always suggest here. They have really good enchiladas and you cant beat a $5 margaritas on Fridays.

I just left Pink Polish and I have to say I was completely amazed. The salon is decorated very nicely with comfy waiting chairs so my husband did not mind the wait. Joy did my nails  I really enjoyed getting to know her and my nails looked amazing. She is definitely the reason I will be back soon.

The food was okay. However, the service wasn't. Our waitress acted like we were not even there. She didn't check in at all. After a long wait she took our orders brought us our food and later brought us our checks. We had to ask for the desert menu and after we got desert she had to reprint our checks.

Hubby and I had dinner last night and the food was amazing. I took a star away because the service was just okay. The people who brought our food out were super nice. However, our waitress brought us our drinks and disappeared. I had to ask another server to bring us our check. We had planned to have to desert as well but it took so long to get our check we skipped it.

Its awesome to be able to see some of my fave comedians locally.  They have a two drink minimum and seating is a little weird but I def cant wait to go back.

The server was amazing the food just was not seasoned well. It would be better if they cooked the food in the seasoning.
