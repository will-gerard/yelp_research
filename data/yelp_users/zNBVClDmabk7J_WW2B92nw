This local company gets it. I used them to work in my chiropractic office for a small job and was so impressed, I had them set up my home system. They were able to do everything I described, which wasn't easy. We had to hang flat screens, bring power, they did it all! The customer service was right on point. They were polite, clean and accessible. My family has now used them and we will surely use them again in the future.

This place is now called Roadhouse. I'm an AZ native, so cave creek biker bar and grills are a staple.  We sat at the bar for about 10 minutes. No one even made eye contact or acknowledged we were there. They were busy, but we sat and watched the two bar tenders pass by us about a dozen times without so much as a "I'll be right with you". It's also over 100 degrees and they have the doors all open. It was sweltering. It was hard not to feel like they didn't want us there for some reason. We eventually got up and left. No one seemed to notice. Look for this place to change hands yet again in the near future.

I love Joyride. Cold Mexican Beer, and good tacos. Service is always great at the bar. I always want to go there...my wife...not so much.  Why?  They charge for chips after the first bowl. Tacos and Mexican food is a traction in AZ. You charge for chips and salsa. It's a rule. If I'm eating and drinking, there are a million places in Phoenix who will be happy to make sure I have some chips and salsa without haggling me over a couple of bucks. It's more the principal than the price.  Also, the cheapest Chardonnay is $10 a glass. Unless this is some punishment for mixing wine with tacos...which I understand...I don't get why they charge fine dinning prices for wine.   All-in-all...I still like this place. But, in AZ, the margin for error in Mexican food is super thin; and Joyride commits some unforced errors.
