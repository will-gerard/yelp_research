Ted's is awesome.  It gets busy, but that's because it is awesome.  If you like "American" food that tastes great, give Ted's a try.

Guedo's has been around forever; I remember going there a few times probably before I was 10 years old.  However, while the food is decent enough, it's overpriced.  Take the tacos, for instance. The beef and chicken taste pretty good, but not for $3 a piece (more if you add on cheese, etc), especially when there is no service involved, akin to a fast food restaurant.  Factor in that it's a hole in the wall type establishment (which I'm absolutely fine with) and the prices should definitely be more reasonable.  The fact that they charge for using a credit card is also absolutely ridiculous.  I didn't receive a spiel about how transaction fees are killing small businesses like some of the others here (and everyone, including the owner, was nice enough), but the fee they charge their customers is obviously inflated and aimed at turning a bit of a profit, despicable.  The transaction fees they pay are part of doing business and should be incorporated into the overall prices of their food (which are already too high).  This sort of practice will harm their business far more than the transactions fees they have to pay ever would.

One of my favorite places to eat here in AZ.  The food is always amazingly delicious and the staff are always super friendly!!!

Note to staff and management, maybe don't package hot food with sushi for take out orders, leaving hot food containers with/on top of the sushi while the order is all bagged up and waiting for pickup.  This has happened to us the last two times ordering take out, leading us to throw out the sushi.

Seeking overpriced mediocrity? Buffalo Wild Wings is the place for you!  The wings and rest of the menu are decent enough but nothing special and the wings themselves don't stand up well to the competition.  That being said, even if the food was a bit better it would still be overpriced.  Service has always been mediocre as well.  Staff are more interested in chatting each other up than tending to their tables, and when they do it feels like the last thing on earth they want to be doing and can't get away from the table quickly enough.

Which Which's store is like a grimy 5 year old: dirty  and sticky.  We've been to this location a few times and it has been a mess each time, from the table tops not being clean to food on the floor to even the glass doors being covered in smeared food finger/hand prints.  Oh, and they are ALWAYS out of napkins (i.e. paper towels).  What gives?  I can't speak for other locations, but this one needs to clean up its act.  If not for the dirty store, I would probably give 4 stars.

I liked this restaurant a lot.  The bulgogi is pretty good (though not the best I've had).  The galbi was great.  It's a little expensive, which is the only reason I hold back from giving Gogi 5 stars.
