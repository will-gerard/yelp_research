My latest shopping experience was very disappointing at the Dillard's in Superstition Springs Mall this last week. Mind you, this has been my go to store to purchase make-up, shoes, clothes, etc. for as long as I can remember.  My work shoes broke and I needed to purchase a new pair. I was in a hurry and found just what I was looking for.  At first I saw only one woman working in the department.  She was extremely busy helping the 20+ people needing shoes.  I then noticed a male sales person who was standing behind a display talking to some younger girls (early 20's).  I waited for over 10 minutes for someone to help me.  After it was obvious the male sales person was not paying attention to the rest of the customers, I approached him to see if they had the shoes in my size.  He proceeded to roll his eyes and continued his conversation.  When the girls left, without purchasing anything or even trying on a pair of shoes, he proceeded to help two other young girls. After receiving no help, I finally had to leave the store without the needed shoes.  While a cute 20 something year old girl is fun to flirt with I suspect it is the rest of us keeping Dillard's open.

The first time I walked into this quaint boutique I wanted to buy everything!  They have such a huge selection of fun and unique items I find myself going back there quite often.  Not only do they have the perfect gifts they have seasonal fruit, breads, jams .....  The owners and employees are always helpful and friendly even on their busiest days!

Phoenix Rock Gym is by far my favorite place to go indoor climbing. Whether you are a beginner or highly experienced you will find the perfect route for you.  I really enjoy how the staff wonders through the gym helping you improve your skills and making sure you are using the equipment properly. The only negative for me is that it is so busy.  Sometimes you do have to wait for a turn on for the routes.  Then again, I have met some very nice people while I have waited.

I have used Watson Flower shops for several years now.  They are always helpful and their arrangements are amazing! Yesterday I sent flowers to my daughter-in-law who had just had twins.  The arrangement was gorgeous!   Not only that, last year I had a last minute "flower emergency" and they made several arrangements for me without hesitation, same day!  Just like that no flower emergency!
