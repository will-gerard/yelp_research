This place is awful as you can see the reviews on here are old, I would never recommend this location to anyone, go and see for yourself and witness managers cussing at employees in front of customers. No respect at all these people clearly hate the career path they have selected.

I have been the unlucky man to get a DUI but that is not the least of your problems. You also have to instal an interlock device in your vehicle which can be very annoying, I have had great service with Hector at Arizona interlocks and also very acceptable phone service when I had a question about billing, I would recommend this plays to friends because they build a relationship with you and make the process as easy as possible i mean after all you have a DUI. This is the best service around to make the process an easy one.

Food was great but the service was terrible, I went there on a team builder with my company and the bartender was rude and the servers had no idea what was going on. Probably won't go back.

I don't understand some of the reviews on here, I took a chance on this place because I don't listen to someone's opinion until I find out on my own and I'm glad I did, lunch is cheap, you get a huge Slice of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks and the wings are decent, it's a quiet place I'll be back.

This location has to be the most unprofessional location I have ever visited. I have went on several occasions and received the worse service, now that being said there are a few nice employees who I feel sorry for because management and the mechanics treat them like shit. I only revisit because it's close to home, I went for an oil change one time and was not sure what an alignment was and a nice employee asked his manger if the alignment station was open and he yelled at the poorer kid in Spanish because it was not open, right in front of me. Also my car has 3 wheel drive so my car can not have the tires rotated and I didn't know that at first. So when they had to change the tires back the mechanic cussed at the employee right in front of me and stated "he should know how the fuck to balance the tires" so unprofessional I would say they are giving pep boys a bad name and making our Hispanic culture look terrible.

Wow what can I say about this wonderful gem. One day driving with my lovely girlfriend we stumbled upon this awesome place and decided to be spontaneous and give it a look. We were greeted with a smile and great service. We had the Sonoran Torta and a some great drinks, we have been back since then on the night of a live band and lovely dancing. The vibe was amazing and so was our date. We will be back.
