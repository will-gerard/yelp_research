Fido crapped in the corner? Fifi stinks? Comet chewed up his leash again? Tired of spending obscene amounts at the local Petco/PetSmart joints? If you answered Yes to any of those then head down to Ryan's.  Its not fancy and totally a warehouse. No fancy shmancy shelves here, just bare bones metal racks filled with a ton of various products for your pets. But of course if you wanted nice racks you'd gone to Petco, no? (Or perhaps Barcelona, but its a different story outright)  So, anyhow. Stuff there is about 40-60% less then local pet store and they do have a large inventory.    Only crappy thing is that they do not have each item labeled with price and you have to rampage through free catalog to figure it out or be like me and say "Fuck it! Can not be THAT much!" and walk out with over $100 worth of doggie stuff. But who cares, right? You did save a bunch of money over pet store.   Check it out if you get chance (Make a point to) you will not walk away disappointed.

Easily one of my favorite places in urban Phoenix. I am a member and we go often. What is there not to like? Its unique. It changes. There are events by a bundle. Even food is semi OK, for such place.   Go there! No i mean it. Go! Stroll through major "Roads", venture to some smaller once, talk to those nice elderly (For the most part) volunteers who will teach you about surviving on Prickly Pears or how Succulent is different from a Cactus.  Do not liter, run around or yell like an idiot, please. Besides that - HAVE FUN! This place is awesome.   "I like" "Very nice"  Eugene

Is super awesome! You come there, check your bags, hangout, get on the plane and leave. When you comeback you repeat whole deal in reverse. Get it?   As Graham C. said "I have a 100% success rate of leaving Sky Harbor on an airplane.  Stop reviewing the fucking airport. "  I ditto that - Stop reviewing fucking airport!!!  PS: So, let's suppose airports sux. Ok, fine. What are you going to do?? NOT use it and drive to Chicago, NYC or Florida? Yeah, right! Who cares if its good or not - there is no other option!!!

Should be 3.5 but i am bumping it up.  Went there for lunch with my friend. He swears its his 2nd most favorite Mexican food place. So, we went. Real small homely looking joint. WHAT?!? 1c tap beer with any Lunch Special? ($6.75) That is awesome. I had some soup and cheese quesadilla. Both were simple and good.   Very much home cooking there. Not a fancy shamncy stuff but your good down to earth grandma's cooking.  If you happen to be there, or work there, or drive through that shady neighborhood, i would totally recommend to stop by and try something there. It surely would be worth it.  "I like"

Totally can not talk crap about this place. There was no line today at all, food is very tasty and fresh, service is nice. Quite interesting experience if you have not been there and absolutely worth checking out.  Not 5 starts for price and upkeep - i feel both cold be somewhat better.  "I like"  Eugene

Quite very good lil' neighborhood joint.   You order your food at the counter but they do bring it out to you. They have special for every day of the week! Like today its Tri-Tip sandwich, pretty nice. Their margaritas are honest and good tasting, and bunch of different kinds of beer does not hurt either.  However, we came there for their $.99 street tacos and were not disapointed even a little bit - tasty, fresh, warm, jucy, delicious little things! "I could be eating those whole day long, man!" - Is what one of my friends said. "When are we coming back?!?" - Was reply from the other.  I also had been there before on my own for dinner, and it was delicious. Fact that meet (fish) is broiled instead of fried gives this place an lot of "Brownie Points" in my book. Or maybe its cuz mesquite broiled Mahi is so good? Or was it pork? No, wait! It was salmon! Yes, for sure it was that. Unless it was white fish or chicken. Ahhhhh......... Screw it! I give up. its all flippin' good.  PS: Wait times are kinds longer then expected. BUT........ it IS worth it. However, i did dogged a star for that. There, now you know.

Totally good! Tasty food. Great unobtrusive service. 50c appetizer if you buy a Kirian beer. Very, very good overall!  Minus one * for way too kiddy atmosphere. They were EVERYWHERE!! Like OMFG, just keep families with children in like one side of the restaurant or something.

What do you do Sunday morning when you do not want any eggs or serial for breakfast? Well, we go to IHOP! And so we did this Sunday. Its 8:30am, there are ton of free tables and we get seated right away. Ohh wait! Its our server's 1st day!! OMG Horror! But, hey, you know what - kid was great! He did all just right and did not screwed up once! Kudos to you David!  So, anyhow. Pancakes were good. Coffee was warm and OJ was fresh. There were no hairs in my plate nor weird stains on my spoon. What else can anyone expect from IHOP?   4 stars! If you wanna huge portion of pancakes go to IHOP, they got that!  "I like"

Quite good for this kind of joint. Portions are large and good to share, if you choose to. Our wait was about 5-7 min on Dec 30th, mid-day. Table was clean and server was pleasant. Brought our tea out promptly followed by some tasty bread. Actual food took a bit longer then i'd like but nothing too bad. If not for nasty little kid screaming behind us like he is being murdered, it would be nice little lunch.   4 stars never the less. Good place! Try their 7 cheeses grilled cheese!!!

Good place if you can muster the bill.   They charge $99 for diagnostic and then apply towards your repair. That is not that bad. However, they quoted me $1150 for this repair. I called around and even dealer had cheaper price by $200!!!! Dealer, for crying out loud.  On a positive note they took my car in right away. Drove me to work (I work close). Diagnosed my car correctly and in timely manner. All in all everything was very professional.   If not for the price they surely would be wrenching on my car now. But they not. Ohhh, well.

Its a dump. Mind you - a very nicely decorated dump. If you wish to hang out and yell over music with out much care what goes in your mouth then this place is for you. If you care about your food you should get in your car and go elsewhere, as this is not a place for Sushi/Rolls lovers. Its mediocre at the very best. Bleah.   "I dunt like" Eugene

Good joint. Brought my friend who have not had good Indian food there. He was willing to try again and i took him there. Guess what - He liked it. Whatever he ordered looked like baby's poop - slimy and greenish, but it tasted really good. My own chicken was quite tasty as well. Everyone gets complimentary bread and some chicken (?!?). Buffet WAS unimpressive.  However, all in all this is a real nice place for some tasty food.  "I like"  Eugene

So, i did not buy shit from them. That is right - i did not. But not cuz i did not wanna. Noooooo Sir/Ma'am. I sure as fuckk wanted to. That special edition Sporster was reeeeeeeeeeeeealy sweet and i could totally see myself riding it till i'd gotten a red monkey butt. But i did not buy it, i also did not buy any other bike from them either. Prices on those bite! Big one! Hard.   Well... Anyhow.. Where was I? Ohh yeah. The lady who works there was super helpful and showed me around and answered my dumb questions. Was willing to help me out to source out a used bike when i am done taking my class. Great service. She did not make me feel stupid or anything and was very helpful. Thanks Deb!  I doubt i'll be back, as my broke ass can not afford a Harley and it feels wrong to buy anything else from Harley dealership. But, if you made of money and want one then get your helmet, gloves, some pants and your phat wallet and head down there. Their inventory is big, shop is clean and people are nice. Vroom.. vroom...

That is what i think of their service! Its like OMFG.   I came in da morning to drop off my scooter for some simple adjustments. I called a few day b4 and made appointment for 8:30am but i been told to be there 8 and they will write me up and send me on my way. So, there i am and they like - we not open till 8:30. Butttt. buttt Alright we will do you favor and write you up.  I call for update about 1pm. Oh yeah its TWO hours worth of labor. WTF! two hours? I been told its one. Ok fine.  I call for update at 3:40 and they JUST putting it on the lift and maybe i can come get it tomorrow? WTF, its my ride home. No, fucking do it today. Actually you know - Do not touch it. I called other dealers and they told me its actually only 30 min of labor not TWO hours.  Bottom line - Procrastinators and upchargers. Take you Harley elsewhere.

Pretty good store. Deserves 4 * from me. Well, maybe more like 3.75* but whatever.   Has a nice selection of somewhat a bit more "Off the beaten" path stuff. Anything from picture frames, to pictures, to furniture, rugs, cloth, food and booze. Anyone can find something they like at the store.     Their furniture is cool and often artisan crafted in some back water countries. Makes it unique and interesting. We have a trunk from them and its pretty neat.    Trinkets isles are cool and offer wide selection of useless junk to blow your hard earned money on.    I usually skip food section as its not very exciting, especially with AJs beeing next door.    Now, wine section is something i spend my time on. They have wine from all over the worls from CA to Greece. This makes it a very interesting shopping, especially if you throw in sales they may have at the moment. Wine section is possibly best part of the store.  "I like"  Eugene

Place rocks!  It IS a bit more $$ then ur usual Asian joint but its really good and portions are rather large. You do order your food yourself at the counter, get your number and find yourself a seat you like. I do not see anything wrong with that, do you? No longer then a few minutes they bring out your food to your table. And ... Yummm.. Yummm its good.  Good lil' joint.  "I like"  Eugene

I am not a demending guy but having working AC is real nice when its 115 out. And so i went to The Car Shop to get it taken care of. Looked up repair facilities in the vicinity of my job and those guys came up and they were AAA rated and all. So, i figured - "What the fuck, its just AC repair. What is the worst can happen? It is already not blowing cold." And so i went.  Droped it off and they gave me ride back to work. Real quick too. Called me back within reasonable time and told me something needs to be rebuilt and they can do it tomorrow.  Droped it off again and another fast ride to work. Got a call within 3 hours that its ready for pickup.  Few weeks later got a call from them asking how it works out for me and all. Really surprising and pleasant.   Pretty good repair shop. I will take my car there again if needed.

Went there to try on HJT CL-MAX helmet that i researched to purchase to protect my precious noggin in case of its contact with significantly harder road pavement.  Anyhow, its your typical "Mom-n-Pop" store - Small, friendly, helpful. I was greeted by owner and he helped me around. Since i knew exactly what i wanted it was not much browsing for me, but he did answered all my questions and shown me other products in the store. He was very patient and explained some finer less obvious details for me.   Bleah, bleah, bleah - How is the price? BEST price i found for this very helmet online would be 'bout $170 and they had it for $184 in the store, tax and all. Yeah, a few bucks more, but i got to try it on before buying it, service was good, i can bring it bakc if something is wrong, etc and MOST importantly - If no one buys from local places, there will be no local places to go and see, touch, try, etc stuff. And that would sux. So, i pay a few bux more to support rocking local business. Thanks Todd!!!

I found a parking spot like 200' away! Woohoo! Area around there reminds me of Brooklyn - Shitload of cars and no parking. Bleah, that is so not Kosher! Oh, what? Ohhh right. Yeah, we went there for a Special Occasion (Yeah, my 29 again B-Day beatches!) Since I made reservations we got our table right away. Vine list is INSANE! No, seriously. Its fucking genormous! Not like you want to spend 456 dollars on 1983 Bordeaux, but its there. Together with 27pages of other vine. But you know what? semi-Cute chick who was our waitress did REMEMBERED 3 different "If not" vine options we gave her. WOW, i am impressed. And our $21 bottle of some whackyass unusual  vine was really good too. Food was quite well prepared and good. I personally did not find it super exciting but it surely was good.  That is it. Its a good joint, especially if you like vine. Go!

Went there for dinner. Was not my choice but i got outvoted. And i gotta say i was not disappointed. Drinks were alright, i had some funky ginger beer. Appetizers were tasty, if not somewhat greasy. My hot-n-sour soup was not bad, if somewhat too vinegary tasting. Wife's Singapore Noodles were pretty good. Tiny dessert samplers ( $2 a pop ) were quite good and tasty.  I think they changed their menu very recently as they have some new items i never seen on their menu before. And that is cool.   Anyhow, it was pretty good dinner finished off by nice dessert. It was not perfect but pretty good never the less.  "I like:

Hahaha This place is a JOKE! Not a good one either.   Me and my friend from work went there Tuesday at lunch in hopes to find V-Star 650 for me to plop my butt on. So, we drive all the way up there, 15 miles non the less. We go inside and ... Its like LOL WTF! There are no bikes! I mean there are some but maybe like 5!!! And like 10 sports bikes. Hummm,,,,, Ok, maybe we just not seeing more and some one from sales staff will show us more. Did i say - sales staff? Ohhh i apologize! What i should have said is - Imaginary sales staff! There was no one there to show us around. Like no one! Not one overweight middle aged dude. Not one over zealous pimply greasy teen. No awkward old guy. Not one weird lesbo. Not ONE SINGLE PERSON!!! Only dude there was someone at the counter in the center who was super busy BSing with some peeps there to even give us a look.  So, we wondered around for whole 2 minutes, said "Fuck this" and left.  Only reason for 2 * is cuz i did get to sit on V-Star 1100. Totally not what i was looking for but at least from same family.   Bahhh! Screw you guys from EXTREME YAMAHA, you are a bad JOKE!  "Bahh! I NO like!"

Pretty good if a bit odd.   My take away Pho was rather a bunch of different bowls and baggies full of various stuff to build your own Pho. Cool in an odd way, perhaps?  Also, i got wrong Pho - seafood vs. chicken. Kind of not the biggest deal ever but never then less.

WARNING - Not fit for human consumption!!!   Wholly shitz what a disappointment. My UK friend and I decided to go there for lunch to check it out.  Neither one of us held our breath very much for it but never the less... We did not expect bland frozen square fish product patties with equally nasty previously frozen tasteless fires. Yes, they are not chips per say, just yeacky french fries.  1st stop as we got back to the office was bathroom and even now my stomach unhappily rumbles under the desk. Down boy, down! It will pass with time.   Disgusting all around. Possibly even insulting.   PS: And WTF is up with not taking credit cards? Scamming "The man"?

Now, when i say "Junk" i do not mean Garbage by any means. Its just..... well.... hard to describe. Some stuff is actually made/built, some pieces are parts of other things, some others are indescribable, some are actual junk LOL.

Yes, i am outraged about the wait. Do not tell me its worth it. It is NOT! No food in the world worth 3 hours wait, unless its last food on Earth.  Especially when they jerk you around - "5 more minutes only", "just another 10 min", "just a few more minutes". Just tell me 30 min and let me make my own call if i want to wait or go (I want to go!)  And to add to this - It was not all that great. Yeah exactly! It did not sux by any means but it was not great. Let me clear it - its bazzilion times better then Dominos or PizzaHoot, a bunch of times better then Garlic something or Pappa J BUT I would take Nello's pizza anytime over this and i would only need to wait for 5 min.  I aint coming back. Bleah! They can have some other losers hang out there for hours waiting for their food.

Went there on Sunday with a bunch of people and LIKED it.   Drinks are questionable. My own Honeydew Watermelon something drink was OK but not awesome. Also, one girl said Pom Margarita was too sugary and not really pomegranty at all. Then we switched to wine, which was 1/2 price, and that was good.   Now food was pretty damn good! I had FEZ Burger, and it was one of the best burgers i ever had! Sweet fries were good too, as were some spicy fries. I tried a few other things from other people as well and it was pretty good, but my burger was the best of them all.  Also, service was top notch  and there was nothing to bitch about there.   Place is clean and very urban. Bathroom is nice and clean as well. There was some background music too, but we were way too loud to hear it.   Here is what totally amazed me and made me give this place allt he stars. As were standing outside, catching a breath from all the eating, drinking and yelling, FEZ's security guard comes by with umbrella (Its pouring out) and asks it we need his spare umbrella to walk to our car! He offers us umbrella! Without us asking! Without us trying to hunt anyone down! AMAZING!   "I like" "Very nice"  Eugene

I drove through mad crowds on 4th of July to have my burger there. And it WAS worth it.  Tasty Fez burger with a heap of sweet fries (Thomas, who IS on your fryer??? Give that person a raise. Those are probably best fried fries to my taste!!! Yummm..... ) and glass of cold Stella. All enjoyed in the company of Mr.Smith himself. What else any normal person can ask for!?!  I just wish there was Fez II close to my neighborhood. Ohh well. Give me a reason to visit that part of the town.

Simply put - IKEA kiks major boody :)  From its sub-dollar trinkets, to few dollar foods to multi hundred dollars leathers. My hose is full of their stuff and i am still coming back. You ask me - But why? Well, i say - Its probably best bang for then buck! It is NOT the best, it is NOT the cheapest. But together it is probably best ratio.  I told my friend we got this leather couch from IKEA and he was - Cool but it will not last 25 years as my couch from XXXX. I was like - Dude, i do NOT want it to last 25 years and sit on the same couch all those years.   Go! Go now! Eat a meatball! Drink Lingenberry drink! Buy a cheapo knife! Find matching set of chairs!

My folks are in town and i was looking to show off some of the "Southwestern" flavor to them. So, i did some research and this little steakhouse came up and looked promising. And so it was on.  Its situated inside of a Hilton Squaw Peak resort, just pull in and keep driving until you come upon it. It has a little parking lot surrounded by great cacti, shrubs and palms. Very cool and cute looking, with HUGE purple prickly pear cactus upfront (I am so jealous!). All very well maintained and looking real nice.   Once inside, we were promptly seated and attended by the waiter named "Quick Draw". In 2 minutes we wanted to change tables because of the horde of raging 3 year old, and he was totally cool with that and did not give me a look or anything. So, service was really good then and through out whole dining experience.   Food was good and plentiful. Their sizes are not  to be joked around - they LARGE! Everything we ordered tasted quite good and seemed to be fresh and well prepared. Drinks were good and honest as well. Even dessert had a bit of "Southwest" flavor to it, as we ordered smores, which you make yourself at your table. That was kind of fun.   Ok, so, how come not all the stars? Its in resort by the pool, so there are people in stretched T-Tops and beach wraps, which kind of semi ruins it. Of course there are also wild yells of retards in the pool, and that does not help either. And of course above mentioned raging children, which are always experience killers. With all that said - It was not bad at all. As we came for dinner, tank topped people were at minimal, pool yellers only were heard a few times, and we hid away from the "Ankle Biters" in the corner.   Go there for dinner. Get a table by the fire pit on the patio. Gaze at the stars, munching on your meat. Stare at the mountain silhouette on the background while sipping on your margarita. This is the life you CAN get used to.  "I like"  Eugene

Yay! I'm a fan! BIG time. This was some seriously delicious experience. There are a lot of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern places out there but hanging a few pictures on the walls and putting Hummus on the menu does not automatically make it so. This place is for real. Coming from NYC and Brooklyn i had ate at my fair share of this kinda places and this one surely keeps up the mark.   Think of a college town joint and prices with Scottsdale taste. Service was great too - Never annoying but we could see the guy glancing at our table often to note if something was needed. They even let us keep the car in their lot as we went on exploring neighborhood.   Not a damn thing bad about this place.  Why not 5 stars? I think it could be a bit more authentic and a bit less cheesy. But in reality it does not matter when food shows up.   "I like"

Consider it a hidden gem!!! Shhhhh do not tell no one though.  Tucked away by the south mountain and hidden from a casual observer the resort itself and its restaurant Latitude 30 are not something you accidentally run across, but totally worth seeking out.   Restaurant itself is very nice with beautiful leaded windows and dark wood paneling. It nicely presents itself as a very classy, rich atmosphere lifted from somewhere early last century (And if you kick out all the people with tank tops and baseball hats, it will totally work for the set of some period movie.) Patio is very spacious and adorned with great flowers, trees and shrubbery. Hidden in there corner there is small lit fountain. It really is very romantic and peaceful. That is where we spent our evening - On the patio.  Service was excellent without being obnoxious. We received free appetizer compliment of the chef. Actual food itself was superb and arrived rather quick. Their menu is not huge but full of interesting stuff you might be hard pressed to find easily. Wine list follows same guidelines. Our desert was free, which came as surprise to us, because i told them it was our anniversary, so that was unexpected and cool.  All i can tell you - if this joint would be in Snotsdale it would be crawling with people, line would be insane and prices would be 3x as much. But, as its not, it was 1/2 empty, we had almost entire patio to ourselves, and whole dinner with a bottle of wine was a bit over $100. It was friggin great!!! Absolutely romantic place for a special occasion or a date.  "I like" "Very nice"  Eugene

It was alright. I was there with real good peeps so it made all the difference.   Food was pretty good. Wings were grilled and kind of different. However, i MUST say they forgot Shrimp in my friends shrimp-something-pasta-special. I mean C'mon!!! We did get free desert out of this and of cuz they replaced his dish. My own Miso Salmon was not bad but i think rice it came with was super buttered up but tasted good. And all food came out blazing fast too.   What i was really bummed about that my Mojito as basically lemony water. I sent it back 2x till 3rd one was ok, JUST OK. I did get charged 2x for this though and did not feel like making a scene being with friends and all.   I did not come there for a crowd, but there we some girls in tight jeans there and some dudes, and some couples. I do not care much.   What is unacceptable is that Bar/Tavern has watered down drinks. That is BAD! I mean B A D !!! I am not a picky person but this is BS, pardon my English. AND i ended up paying 2x for this water. Bleah, doubt i will be back.  EDIT: I thought about it, compared to my other experiences i had at some other similar joints and i am bumping this one down a notch! Sorry The Vig, get your act together. Swanky decor aint cutting it.  Eugene

"Tanked Fish" is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often.   Rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there. Price is very reasonable. And drinks selection, if not overly excessive, is "Cool".  Place is not riddled with kids, like many other places are, and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there. One one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list. Its real neat. What else is neat - their happy hour on Wednesday (I am not sure what day exactly to be honest. Call them if you really want to know.), when drinks, starters and most rolls are 1/2! This really makes a huge difference.   I gave this place 4 starts. This is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this.   "I like" Eugene

CK is a great place to have around. We been there a bunch of times and never disappointed. Every single day they have drinks special, and some day food special. Like today is Blue Moon Pint $2 C'mon!!! Its great. Food is also excellent. Fresh, tasty and sizable. I favor their Special K sandwich - it really is very good. Ask for them to wrap it for you instead on the bun. Good stuff. They have inside and outside areas. Inside has 2 pool tables, bar and bunch of TVs. Outside is a nicely sized patio with a TV or 2. They do not mind if you smoke outside.  Just a note - parking lot is usually really full and it may take you a bit to find parking.   All in all CK's is a great place for lunch, dinner, watch a game and/or have a few.   "I like"  Eugene

Consistently good. We found this joint by accident and been there a few times. Food is quite good and they have some items that are a bit hard to come by other places around for some reason - Like Soba Soup.  Service was pretty nice and food came out rather fast and as always tasted real good.   "I like"  Eugene

Hooked me up for FREE! Thanks guy, you rock!  So, my tire went flat. I pump it up and head straight there. Its Lunch hour, but they take my car in within 5 min. 20 or so min later its all over. Fixed where air was coming from, balanced and even put in a new valve. I was gonna pay them, of course but got waived away - "Do not worry about it, have a nice day." WOW Like seriously! Super quick and did not wanna charge me nothing. How can you not appreciate that?  All the stars!  "I Like" "Very nice"

Place is a Mecca for cheapass DIYselfer!   Do not expect a fancy showroom here. Do not expect "How are you? Can i help you with ANYTHING today?" from a pimply teen. Do not expect to see a brand you seen before - "WTF kinda brand is Dixie Picks?!?" Do not expect to drop a ton of cash here - "What? 79c on sale for this screwdriver?!? OMFG i was totally looking for this kind."  DO EXPECT a ton of cheap shit - tools, hardware, garden stuff, machinery, etc Whatever you may need to use to perform some task in and around the house. Its there. None of it is blingy, in shiny wrappers or of superb quality, but its all there.   Bottom line is - If you need something that you are not planning on using forever or hard or ever and do not want to pay real money for it - this place is for YOU! If you need something disposable for one time use and to throw out - this place is for YOU! If you are silly and think $3 China made ratchet will last you lifetime and perform flawlessly - this place is for YOU! If you need something that IS of some kinda brand name and they happen to carry it - this place is for YOU!  "I like"

Well it was open! That made a decision for us to go there vs. nearing Indian restaurant. And guess what - it was totally worth it. Yeah ice tea suxed, do not order that. But rolls were awesome, as was peanut sauce they came with. Other two dishes we got were pretty good too, can not recall what it was.  Service was good without being too annoying or non-present. Place seemed to be constantly busy with slow/steady flow of walk-ins and orders.  All in all, it was pretty good lunch.  "I like"  Eugene

Pretty nice little hole in the wall Mexican joint. Conveniently situated next to Home Depot its out of the way and real easy to miss. But if you come to HD for a ladder or paint or whatever, and happen to be hungry then this little place is for you.  Do not expect anything fancy or special but i do not think you will be disappointed. Give it s shot, it will not cost you much either.  "I like"

Ok, so water pump on VW went south. Bye, bye! Code P0117 BTW. Ok, so it happens, never a good time for such thing to happen. So, i sober up , wipe my nose and start calling for prices. $1150, $795, $950 - OUCH, OUCH and OUCH! Ohh wait $650? And you can have it done tomorrow? And you only really work on quirky VWs and Audis and certified VW tech? And i do not even need to come with the car (Its on the tow truck at that point)? Ok, i am sold!  So, my Bugger gets towed to Steven's shop (Its owners/operators name). He calls me back when truck arrives and lets me know car is safe and sound and that he is going to jump on it in the morning and should be done by 5pm tomorrow. Ok, sounds good.  Tomorrow rolls around. Of course, i am inpatient and i call them about 2pm - All good we are smoothly wrenching on it. Will it be done by 5? Yeah, it should or we'll call you not to come for it. Great!  So, we jump in my Subaru and get there about 5pm. Owner outside. Its a small shop with bunch of vw, audi, bmws outside. WOW Busy for such small place, cool. My Bug is on the lift humming away. Is it done? Yes. Is it fine? Yes. All went smooth? Yes. Ok great, leeme pay for it. We go in the office and take care of payment, where Steve shows me old water pumps he removed and saved to demonstrate this common VW problem. By the time we done car is outside and ready for us to take him home.   All in all it was pretty nice experience - good price, small shop (I do not favor those huge industrial repair facilities), honest service, pleasant owner. What else could one want? I just wish they hosed off the engine or something, it smelled like antifreeze all the way home.   Thanks Steve and your guys. Bug is happy and running fine.   "I like"  Eugene

Quite very good!   We came there Friday night as a small group of 8 people. Service was terrific. I would be hard pressed to find more accommodating personnel! Every one is super friendly without being too obnoxious, that is hard to find.   Its also BYOB, and that is a great plus! They will be happy to chill your beer and bring out a cooler for the table to your wine or sake. Super nice! Food was excellent too. One of the friends referred to it as "Best Ever!", but i do not know about that. It's surely VERY good - fresh, good quality, well prepared. All top notch.  It was a good experience and while it was somewhat pricey, i will not hesitate to drop by if i am around there.   "I like!"

For a chainy place this was good.  Went there for lunch today. It was not bad at all. Sure its a chain, but does it really matter? Their menu is somewhat interesting. Most items have some kind of finicky twist to them. Service was good and ice tea was cold.  It could be cheaper or more interesting but its pretty good as is. Gotta try something new, right?

OK i gotta say - Best theater i ever been to so far. Just like that, yes!!! Its new, its huge, screen is amazing, sound is awesome - What else can one want from a movie theater!! I did not buy any food or drink there, so i can not comment on that, but judging by amounts of food others were hauling in, i would probably say that its not any worse then anywhere else.

We went there a while ago, when they just opened up, so this might be a little dated, but ...  It was not good. SLOOOOOOW service, boring food. Maybe booze is good there but we did not have any for lunch.   All in all, i felt kind of bad that i dragged my guys there.  "I no like"  Eugene

Great place.   Whatever your poison might be (Get it? C'mon ;) ) you will find it there - Beer, wine, hard liqueur, mixers, malts, syrups, etc. and they are from all over the world, from most popular to the ones your go like "Where the heck is that place???". There is also large selection of helper products - cheeses, crackers, spreads, cups, glasses, gift sets, etc.   Reason i am not giving this place all the stars - prices! I feel they could drop them a buck or two and also carry a bit more ~$5 a bottle wines. You know, not everyone can afford 15+ bux a bottle for dinner all the time.  All in all its an excellent store, if you in the neighborhood - drop by and check it out.   "I like"  Eugene

Ok, i must say - i did not drink any tea there. But...... hold you hater... i did sample some of their smoothie. And i gotta tell you kids - its friggin great!  They have a bunch of different smoothie flavors and many different teas, any of which can be had iced or hot (Which is cool, cuz many places only would do a few teas iced, like its really complicated thing.)  Anyhow, it think its pertty good and i will be MORE then willing to get some tea/smoothie from them next time i am there.  "I like"  Eugene

U like greasy teens? U like old dudes hanging out with greasy teens? U like out of the way dinky little plaza? U like good Mexican food? Yes, it IS good. "I shall comeback" kind of good.   Place is dinky and out of the way but seems clean and food comes out reasonably quick and it tastes good. There were 3 of us who went there for lunch and we all were happy with our orders.   Good lil' join to stop by and grab a bite in super non-pretentious environment.  Ohh yeah!!! Almost forgot - they open 24/7. That is right beatches EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY LONG!!!!

Pretty nice. Parking somewhat tight but nothing too bad. Common slew of standard shops with a few once i never seen before thrown in for a good measure. Its nice that you walk outside and i think even in the summer its not going to be too bad as it seems there will be plenty of shade. Of course, its super new so everything is nice and clean and all. I would not drive there for miles and miles, but if its somewhat near by its totally worth checking out.  "I like"  Eugene

Ok, i am going to apologize in advance to all those nice folks who like this place - you got jeeped!!!   This was one of the MOST unappetizing lunch i had in the looong time. Cold rice, bland chicken, non-friendly service, somewhat expensive. "Not spicy 'nogh fo' yo? I bring hot sauce!" HUH? WTF. I do not want hot sauce, i want properly prepared dish.  I never came back and neither i intend to .  "I no like"  Eugene

This place kicks major boody!  Its new, its huge, its very well stocked, there are various free tastings all the times.   We were the Sunday and they had Italian wine tasting. With real Wine Master present, never the less. I tasted and tasted and tasted some more LOL Probably tasted 1 1/2 glass worth of different Italian wines. Of course, i bought a bottle too - can not just taste and buy nothing.   Their prices are somewhat on the higher end of the spectrum, not as high as AJ's of course. But produce seems to be fresh and variety is nice. That theme pretty much goes through entire store.   If i lived really near by i would have gone in there way more often, but for 20 min drive i do not go there too much. All in all, it is great to have such store in the vicinity.  "I like"

Ahhh almost forgot bout this place. We went there for lunch from work when it first opened up. My friend could not shut it about Philly steak and CheezeWiz (Or whatever its called.)  So, they dragged me in there. I could not bring myself to order fat dripping and CheezeWiz smothered real Cheese Steak so i ordered chicken one instead. It was BORING, dry and uninteresting. My granny (One from mom's side who can not cook) could make it way better.  So, while i honestly can not evaluate their main product - Cheese Steak,  whatever i got kinda suxed!  They do draw big crowds now and sometime there is no place to seat, or at least that is what guys from work telling me. But whataver...  "I no like"

Pretty damn good lil' joint.   We went there on Sunday @ ~ 5pm. It was not crowded at all and we got a table right away. Lil' girl came and asked what we want to drink. We shooed her away as we were not ready. But we made up our minds in a few min and she came right back to take our order for drinks. In the meanwhile chips and tasty salsa made its way to the table. By the time she came back with out Margaritas we were ready to order food and did so.   We got some soup and a Burrito Enchilada Style. Soup was properly warmed and sized and tasted good, to boot. Burrito was HUGE! Did i say HUGE? I never EVER seen gianormous burrito like this in my life, and l love Mexican food and consume quite a bit of it. So... it was HUGE! And tasted real good too.   All in all, it was good food for a fair price. I can not complain one single bit and will more then likely come back there.  "I like" "Very nice"  Eugene

Good store. A lot better then Home Depot in my opinion. Much more helpful people and that makes all the difference. Ok prices, nice plants selection, clearance sales often. What else can one say? Its a home improvement store.  If in doubt, go there and ask questions and look around. If you have a handy friend then bring along. I usually do not walk away unhappy from there.  "I like"  Eugene

So, this new one just opened up today! Woohoo! I been wating for it. So, as any dedicated yelper should, i headed there at lunch to check it out. Here is what i found out.  Its not huge. Its well but not over flowingly stocked. They use mostly own brand (Say 80% own, 20% other brands.) There are some things i have not seen in other stores.   Lemme elaborate a bit. This is really a niche store. It will not please people who love to go to supermarket and brow isles and pick up useless junk. This store is small. Imagine maybe three 7/11 stores together and you will get its size. They have most of the thing normal person would need, but probably do not have odd stuff large supermarkets have. Like, they would have 5-6 kinds of their own pasta sauce, 2 kinds of other brands and 2 kinds other brand. That is it. There would be no 32 varieties by 12 different brands.   Because they mainly sell their own brand its possible to find some unusual items. I picked up a jar of Cuban Bean Dip. Never seen it before and have no idea what it would be, but what the hell!!! They also had some Equadorian beer i have not come across before. Not their own brand but cool.  Cool thing i liked - No Member card nor sale (At the moment anyhow). Price you see is price you get, no gimmicks, no games.  It was really crazy there today as its 1st day. But i suppose crowds will die down and it will be pretty pleasant place to shop once you learn their inventory.   "I like"  Eugene

Yeah it kind of sux! Burgers aint that great (Though not terrible), girls aint that hot (At all :( ), place aint very exciting (or clean).  Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind.   They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much "Old times charm" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you.   I do not know, whole thing kind of odd. It would fit my better in like Greer or Page or something, rather then in Chandler.

Pretty cool Euro inspired furniture. modern, light, fresh in color. Not for your Victorian style lovers at all. If i had to gauge it i wold somewhere above Ikea and Euroway. If Ikea is Walmart, Euroway is Traget, then this is Macy's.  We were looking for a chase forever and finally found one there. Were able to pick one of MANY custom fabrics for it too, none of that "What you see is what you get" boolshit.  And actually got 20% off as well, as they have store wide sale happening right now. Did not know that but it took $119 off from already fairly priced item.   "I like"

Ohh yeah, i remember this place. Went there when we just got a house in search of appliances.  I kinda wondered around the stored, groped some fridges and stoves, fondled some microwaves, played with washer/dryers. Interestingly enough no one was interested weather I am there for a tour or actually going to purchase something.  I did not find their listed prices to be amazing, and no one bothered to assist me with possibly better prices, so i just left. Screw them!  "I NO like"

Accidentally found this place. We were totally on the way to the Thai place on the same plaza when Chez Monieux appeared. Cajun food? Hummmm... My friend said he had Thai but have not had Cajun and that sealed the deal.  So, we go inside and place is totally empty. I mean no one is there. WOW What the?!? But no matter, we were quickly greeted and seated at the table of our picking. Chit-chat with the guy and turns out they are like super new. Just opened up and not many people even know about them, and today supposedly weirdly slow anyhow. Ok cool, better for us!! We order up 2 platters and it shows up real quick. They even split it for us as we asked, so we can easily try each other orders. And try we did! It was GOOD! I mean, really REALLY good stuff. And it was lots of it. Did i mention it was good? In fact, my buddy could not stop eating it even though her kept on saying -"I can not stuff anything else in!" But its simply too hard to pull yourself from it.  I do not give rave reviews very often, but this is totally one of them. You should absolutely check it out, its worth it. Yes, it might be in the little plaza next to the freeway and ambiance might be all but non-existent. But who cares?!? Go for food. You will not be disappointed!  PS: Went there a little while ago again with thy wife. She liked it as well. They now have full bar and about 6 beers on tap, including one from New Orleans (Raspberry one, real refreshing.)

I had been waiting for this place to open up for Months. Its right by my Gym and i was stocked to see this new somewhat unusual place is getting ready to get open. Indian food!!! Yummm. South Indian!?! Hummm... Cool. Vegetarian?!? I am game.   So, they finally opened up last week and we went there Friday for a dinner. Its not fancy and all - Just a few sitting stations on the big white room with a few TVs showing some Indian news. You order your food at the counter, take out style. Nothing interesting there. But fun starts when you get it!!! Sizes are large, MANY different things to choose from, there is a condiments bar. And, most importantly, it tastes really good!!! I mean fingerlickinggood!!!   Why 5 stars? SERVICE! It was real good, owner there really friendly, very helpful and even hooked me up with a free Mango Lassi. "Pay next tine, maybe?!" - He said. WOW!  I can not wait to go back and try some other dish!!! I hope they stay in business and i will be able to go there time after time! You should check it out too!  "I like" "Very nice"

Went again for lunch! Yuuummmm yummmmm Polished off a huge bowl of Curry Eggplant! Its so fucking delicious!!! Hawaiian guy and Indian girl i went with loved it as well.   It IS a bit more spicy then your run of the mill average Indian joint. So be aware of that. I am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you, but then, of course, you toning down your experience.   I loved it as is. Its awesome and i am sure as hell coming back!  PLEASE!!! P L E A S E do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non-related shit!!! Stop by and try it. I brought half a dozen people there at various times and not one walked away disappointed - From actual Indian people to Alabama hick, to Scottsdale snob to average Joe.

If you grew up somewhere where there is no dinky little restaurants do not go there - You will be shocked! Shit, i grew up in NYC and i was a bit surprised, especially after living in Phoenix for a while. Their advertisement of NY Style Chinese Food is quite correct - dinky little place between nail saloon and bread store, disgusting dirty dishes on plastic beat up tables, some pimply asian teen who does not speak much English behind a counter, a "Chef" reading Chinese news paper in the corner chair. WOW Home sweet home!   Since i called in and placed my order i did not have to wait too long, perhaps 3-5 min or so. Then i been given a bag with some boxes and told "Want somsing else? Its sere, in corner. Sank u, bye" Great, we will not go hungry tonight!!! So, i take it home and we dig in. Alright cool!!! They did not forget my free egg roll, very nice of them and i did not even need to remind anyone (Alright, i forgot myself!)  At the end it was pretty nice dinner. They had somewhat hard to find Singaporean Noodle dish and i got that and was not disappointed - It tasted quite good and was not too greasy. Amazing Chicken was not so amazing but not too bad all in all.   Not quite NYC caliber Chinese food, but not too bad. As long as you try not to think about sanitary conditions there. But hey, growing up in Brooklyn has its benefits, you learn to see past some things LOL   "I like"

Very nice. Went for Friday dinner there. Had an appetizer, 2 entries and desert. All were very tasty, but unfortunately entrees were drowning in fat. It tasted great but i felt really bad and guilty about stuffing my face with this.  Place seems pretty clean and service was attentive for the most part. It was busy but not annoyingly crazy. Did not notice any liquor there, not even beer. Jasmine ice tea was kinda bland, as was Vietnamese Tricolor Desert. However, wife's Thai Tea was one of the best!!!  Certainly a place to comeback to.

Total sux ass! What a disappointment.   We found out that a new Indian place openning up near by and wanted to go check it out. Came once and they were closed. Came again and they were closed. But finally today we found place open. Ordered some stuff, got some boxes took them home (Its really not an eat in kinda place unless you like dinky tables and Walmart plastic chairs.)  Ohh boy! Ohh boy! Ohh wait! Rice? WTF! Its just a bowl of rice with some very little "Stuff" on top of it. WOW Are those vegetables from frozen pack, cuz it sure looks like it. Tastes like it too.  So, i just paid 15 bux for 2 small bowls of rice with some questionable chicken and some frozen veggies that tasted like fast food Indian.   Damn i feel violated.

I dunt know, i liked it. Hardly best Chinese i had by a long mile, but something that you get at the fast food setting and comes out of the tray... You know - It was not bad. There was some flavor. And it was not grease, which is huge with me. Good stuff!!!

This place is super awesome, if you like this kinda stuff! Its wall to wall stuffed with Southwest/New Mexican/Mexican inspired stuff. And when i say stuff, i actually mean just that - stuff! It is impossible to describe what exactly they sell as they seems to sell it all - furniture, mirrors, antiques, chairs, benches, pictures, ceramics, garden things, house decorations, wall plates, vases, trays, etc, etc, etc list goes on and on.   Its super fun to stroll through the isles there awed eye, looking around trying to find something you have not seen yet. And for the most part, do find that weird something you are hunting for.   I totally dig this place, and have purchased a few odds and ends from them and plan on hitting it back, every now and again, as their inventory always changes and unique things float in sometimes.   I titally can not find a bad thing about this place as their service is always good, prices are fair and more often then not they even have 25%-50% off sales. One can not beat that.
