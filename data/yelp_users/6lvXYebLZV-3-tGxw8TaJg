They are inefficient and sloppy (at running the practice). I've sat twice for over an hour each time when I had booked an appointment. When I called to confirm my appointment they didn't even have my orthotics ready and had to pain me out a month because they "forgot to order it."  Dr zhang is great but his office is a waste of time. I will be going elsewhere. I am a professional as well and I can't imagine making my clients wait for an hour when they have an appointment.  Again I note the dr. And his nurses are great, the receptionist needs to be replaced. Asap.

I see other peoples reviews, you just need to know what you are getting into.  This is used furniture.  I love the place. We have bought a TON of pieces from them.  You just have to be prepared to dig things out in a warehouse and know what you are looking for.  This is NOT new.  This is used, but good quality, and cheap!

I wouldn't take my dogs anywhere else. Adobe animal Hospital has been my vet team since 2001 when I moved to Scottsdale. They have treated my cats, my dogs, and kept me calm during rough times. Thank you so much Adobe five-star all the way! I refer all of my friends and family to Adobe Animal Hospital.
