My fianc√©e and I dined at Roka Akor on a Friday evening.  The manager, Angelo, has the place running great!  Our server, Jesse, created a dining experience for us that was delicious with dishes ranging from raw sushi to masterfully-cooked prawn to a palette-cleansing dessert. We definitely recommend this restaurant!

Over Easy is a great place to eat breakfast or brunch. It has great service (very nice people). Their food is eggcellent!! We are having fun listening to cool music on the patio.

Despite the rumored facial recognition monitoring system keeping repeat customers from coming back, we made it in last night again. Despite Howard's depressing opinion of his act and club, we love going to Stand Up Scottsdale. However, we are the nimrods that have kids and smaller stacks of money than single people. We manage to laugh our asses off despite the place being a little rough around the edges, but I think the point of a comedy club is to laugh - not to be pampered.   I just realized that I used the word "despite" a lot here and I think I know why. This club is fun!  I always have a good time. Howard gets good talent on stage. The high rating it gets here is earned. However, there's one thing that I would recommend you do Howard. Please cut back on the "don't come back" routine. Don't get me wrong, as a parent, I fully get the value of reverse psychology. However, in your case it isn't working for me because it's boring. It's the same routine each time. Mix it up a bit. Drop the sad sack bit and go back to euthanasia jokes or something you can sink your teeth into.   We will be back!

Excessively loud. Wait staff is lost. It takes a while to order and get drinks. The server forgot simple things like silverware and sauce for chicken tenders. The price is not worth the lack of service.

CPR came to the rescue when my daughter's iPod that she got for her birthday broke the first day she had it. They solved the problem with reasonable prices. The staff was extremely friendly. They even put on my daughter's favorite show on their TV while we waited. If you have anything wrong with your phone or electronic device, take it to them. They will get it fixed!

I had a very similar situation happen to me this week. My warranty company assigned them to an issue I had with a leak in my bathtub. The technicians were okay minus calling in sick and forcing us to reschedule several times. The major issue I had with them was their office staff. They were very rude and inappropriate. Ruby referred to one of their clients who was causing my appointment to be delayed as not mentally stable. Then, she asked me to describe the plumbers by race. This company is terrible and I would not recommend them to anyone. I will call my warranty company to request that they remove them as a service provider as well.
