Great, fast service. They have support staff inside of the car wash touching up and scrubbing your car as it's going through the car wash to make sure nothing is missed. Easy to use and conveniently located.

Poor customer service. This is not the pizza place for late night ordering. Save yourself the time and hassle and go somewhere else. I attempted to place a pickup order twice late night around 3:30 am after getting out of work, and both times they placed me on hold and never answered. It's called the freeze out; put someone on hold long enough, they will eventually give up. Gus' must not need the extra business.

This LA Fitness location is an embarrassment to it's company name and an embarrassment as a gym or business overall.   1. This used to be a 24 Hr Fitness, bought out by LA.  The members and their accounts have not been taken care of properly in the transition, which was supposed to be supervised and facilitated by the management team on site.  3. This location is uncleanly, the equipment is not maintained and some is consistently "out of order".   2. The management, or the main female manager at this location is completely incompetent, unprofessional and lacks basic customer service etiquette. She was not knowledgeable on member contracts as well as the contract 24 and La were under to correctly perform membership transitions among the two.   I had moved from CA where I had both an LA and 24 membership. I wanted to use this location, now an LA fitness location transitioned from 24. She not only failed to explain how California 24 Hr fitness contracts varied from AZ member contracts and how this applies to the buy out, but also cancelled the wrong membership for me (canceled LA), leaving me with a CA 24 Hr membership. After being billed continuously for months thinking this was taken care of, I went back to her to see what has happening. She was very unprofessional, interruptive, snappy and replied with "I can't speak for what I was thinking or doing back then, it was a few months ago." She was on her way out to lunch. She resolved nothing but to reactivate my LA fitness membership she had mistakenly canceled, and told me to take it up with corporate. At this point I am back paying 2 memberships for 2 different gyms. In the meantime I have been dealing with both LA and 24 member services which could not help get me reimbursed, saying the transition was not performed correctly (thanks manager at LA). I spoke to over 6 people, waited on hold for hours, and kept getting passed around from one to the other, neither claiming responsibility.   Not only has this one manager at this LA fitness caused me countless hours of frustration and incorrect billing that will not be reimbursed, but the company has let me down overall.   I failed to mention that the day I was in the club in person the VP of LA fitness was there and overheard this unprofessional transaction taking place. I asked another team member if I could perhaps explain my situation to the VP and the ordeal with this manager however he did not take the time to speak to me and passed on the corporate member service number. He clearly does not care about LA fitness members either.   Overall a total disappointment from the bottom up. Thanks LA Fitness. Please take your business elsewhere, with so many competitive gyms now available that have better equipment, facilities and care about their member relationships, why ever go here?
