The pharmacy is the best and David is by far the greatest pharmacist I've ever had! The atmosphere is very friendly and I always feel known and welcomed! Love the staff I would highly recommend using the Rio Salado Target pharmacy!

Fair Trade is great for coffee. The sole purpose of my visit today was for coffee, but the menu looked too enticing to pass up. Unfortunately, only the typography of the menu is delectable because the food was terrible. My tuna melt had such little flavor, I thought about putting salt on it. My roommate loved her tea and desserts, but paid for a full dish of tempeh scramble and got less than a side dish. Good thing, though, because it didn't taste well either. So come to Fair Trade for the coffee, raspberry hibiscus tea (ask for it iced!) and their desserts, not entr√©es.

The wait wasn't too bad. Came in with a list of problems and the doctor was able to quickly assess the issues. Very friendly. I wish they had some complimentary water bottles like some of the other urgent care centers but that is minor. The free prescription for checking in was a great surprise and definitely helped out financially with the other meds I am purchasing. Overall pretty satisfactory visit. I've been going to ASU for four years now and this is my favorite urgent care center I've been to. Highly recommend.

The food is so delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant to everybody! The other day my family was in town and it was a "must" to take them to True Food Kitchen. We ordered drinks (I got the Pomegranate Acai Mojito), appetizers (Shiitake & Tofu Lettuce Cups), and entrees. I ordered the "INSIDE OUT" Quinoa Burger. SO GOOD. It includes hummus, veggies, tzatziki, avocado - all the good stuff. One of my favorite meals i've had in a long time. Everything was so fresh and yummy.

Great atmosphere. Tacos are so incredible. Don't even get me started on the pop tarts! TO DIE FOR. Great to come hang out with a bunch of girls and have a great time. Can't wait to try some of their ales the next time I come here (which will definitely be in the very near future)!

My coworker and I had an hour break together (we work at Fashion Square Mall) and decided to get of the vibe. We went North on Scottsdale road arrived quickly at Nekter. I've never been to a juice bar before but I make my own at home, and they were so delicious. We got one of each kind for my coworkers and I really loved my order of The Greenie. The PB acai bowl was incredible (my favorite was how it was topped in hempseed granola). All-around just a healthy and fresh lunch. We had a great time, the workers are very friendly and the atmosphere is unique. Definitely will be back.
