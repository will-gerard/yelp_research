This office is always amazing. The staff are so lovely and really make sure they do their best to take care of all my needs quickly. I have never had any problems with my prescriptions or lab work. They always contact me with my results promptly. The doctors are very professional & friendly.  I love this office and will always be a patient of Consultants in Internal Medicine. :)

Sooooo delicious! You just can't beat their lunch specials. Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, and 2 Crab Rangoons - for under $5? - Such a good deal. Great food, nice staff, fast delivery! We love Bamboo!

My mom and I just stopped by this place on a whim tonight and I am extremely thankful we did. I get pretty anxious when I'm about to make a big decision so we were just planning on making an appointment for next weekend. Lindsay was absolutely delightful and welcomed us to shop and try on dresses right then and there since she didn't have any other appointments! I took a look around and was astounded by all the beautiful dresses! (It's a pretty small shop so I actually had low expectations) Lindsay introduced my mom and I to Shae who was training so I was going to be her first bridal consult! That was fine with me because I was nervous too. Both of our nerves were gone in an instant once we got to chatting and trying on the fabulous gowns. The dresses were to die for. BUT they were all still within my budget! After 5 dresses I found THE ONE. Perfect fit. Everything I could have ever wanted. My mom paid for it and I got to take it right home! Now it's hanging in my closet waiting for 2/28/15! I could not have had a better shopping experience with the girls here. They were easy to talk to, knowledgable about the dresses AND had tons of references for us for other pieces of the wedding. I'm ecstatic. I'm in love. With my fianc√©, and with my wedding dress! Thank you so much ladies!

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've never been so frustrated in my life. I am no bridezilla. All I wanted was my bridesmaids dresses to match. One of the dresses we chose was from a different designer so we were concerned, but the ladies at the shop ASSURED me that they would match based off some swatches they showed us. I ordered 8 dresses in different styles. (Spending well over $1000 mind you) 7 came in beautifully. The one from the different designer did not match at all. Ok. No worries, We have time... I'll just pay the rush charges to order a different dress. I work in customer service. I know that when the customer is not happy there are SIMPLE solutions to rectify the situation. My simple solution would have been to order a new dress. The one that was a mistake can EASILY be sold off the rack. However, this store does not believe in customer service. They have a "tough luck" policy that they FAILED to mention at the time of purchase. The "manager" Shelley is completely condescending and has absolutely no compassion for a bride in distress. She wants us to pay $160 for a dress that we cant use AND THEN pay another $180 to rush order a new one that actually matches. At any point in time while I was ordering these dresses, if one of the employees made it a point that matching would have been an issue I would have simply made my bridesmaid choose the same designer. On the contrary we were promised there would be no issue. Well there is a huge issue. This company, its manager, and their policies. Do not expect ANY competence, care, or customer service from this business.

Chris was truly the BEST wedding DJ I have ever seen. I am so thankful we got him in our package at the Bella Rose Estate. We loved working with him. His equipment is insane. His music selection is spot on. His personality is amazing. ( And his house is BADASS!)   Great DJ, Great Guy all around.  Thank you for orchestrating the best night of our lives Chris! We were so lucky to have you!   Mr. & Mrs. Marino February 28th 2015

These guys came in our package so we had no choice, and had never even met them before the night of our wedding.  First of all, I accidentally forgot my driver's license in my hotel room and the guy was giving me such a hard time almost wouldn't serve me. (Sorry I am the Bride, had a few other things on my mind. Plus I am 25 didn't think it was going to be an issue at MY wedding.)   Second of all, they were jerks! I had at least 5 different guests mention to me that our wedding was absolutely perfect, except the bartenders were rude.   My family is a big fan of whiskey on the rocks. We are not the type to mix soda in with our perfectly good liquor. Our bartenders REFUSED to pour a drink straight up.  It's not even like my guests were crazy and out of control! I mean I can understand if people were getting sloppy ordering shots shots shots. But this was NOT the case. This was at the very BEGINNING of the night!   The last straw was me, standing up at the bar for at least 2 minutes before either of them even looked over to me! THE BRIDE! While waiting for a drink I overheard a nasty remark one of them made about MY father-in-law coming behind the bar to ask for a drink. HE PAID FOR ALL THE ALCOHOL! Have some respect.  As far as I am concerned these guys do not deserve to work ANY wedding ever.

We have been here twice in the past month and it seems to always be busy. Very small place, seemed like everyone turns their head every time the door opens. Food is GREAT, huge portions for very reasonable prices. Would like to see more drink specials. Great music, Friendly girls, thank god we finally have a little neighbor hood bar close by.

After months of searching for the perfect venue in AZ I was becoming frustrated. At each place there was something missing and the prices were all way out of my budget.   Then we finally stumbled upon this incredible place. It was love at first sight. Bella Rose Estate literally had EVERYTHING I was looking for on my long list of hopes for our big day. (As well as a package pricing option that made it easy for us to afford!)  A huge property with plenty of space for all our guests. A gorgeous outdoor ceremony area. Beautiful garden & fountain settings which made for the perfect background in photos. The PERFECT cocktail area with outdoor bar, fountain & fireplace! (We had a cigar bar and corn hole boards so we needed it to be outdoors with plenty of space.) The Bridal suite was stunning and really made getting ready with all my girls feel extra special. But really the show stopper for me was the ballroom. Incredibly high ceilings with the most gorgeous chandeliers! PLUS the wall colors matched our palette! FATE!  All of the aspects of the venue were absolutely wonderful but what really made our day so perfect were the owners Leslie & Chad. I can't thank them enough for the work they put in to make sure everything went smoothly and beautifully. Even when the weather was looking a little questionable, Leslie's calming demeanor made me so relaxed as I knew she had everything under control. And Chad's fun personality was such a pleasure to work with throughout the entire process.   I look back on our wedding day with so much happiness and love. And I really owe a lot of that to the fact that we had the most perfect venue and service I could ever ask for.  Thank you so much Leslie and Chad for having us!
