One of the cleaner Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation locations I have been too (and I have been to quite a few).  They really kept it clean and fresh here. The food was really fresh, and it was well-stocked. I like the layout of this particular location as well, as it makes it really easy to see what my kids are up to when they get up to get food.

Our server, Fred, was the highlight of this experience. I am a vegetarian, and my husband and son are pescatarians. We don't expect people to completely understand these dietary restrictions, but Fred did. He let us know exactly what to order and not to order. (Fyi... the black bean soup has pork in it).   I had the linguine. It was very good. The sauce had a slight spicy kick, but just enough. My son had the tilapia, which I was grateful to see on the kids menu.   Summer is reggae time. I wish we knew this Saturday night. They have a 5 piece Jamaican band Saturdays, but we missed it. There was a live musician though, who was fun and friendly. Loved the music and the atmosphere at this place.   The Bahamarita was fun and delicious. Even better, they have a virgin version, which made my daughter's night.   When my daughter melted down and wanted to leave immediately (it was late), Fred was super fast getting us out the door. This goes a long way in my book.

I wasn't impressed by this Chuck E. Cheese.  They have no lunch specials available during the summer at all, despite advertising that they have several available when the kids are in school. Well, how about you capitalize on this additional traffic and have some lunch special, even if it costs a little more, so I might actually want to eat with my kids here?   Then, I went to buy tokens at the register because I only had a $20 bill, and I just wanted to spend $10 on tokens. The tokens at the machine are $5 for 15 tokens. Up at the register, you can buy $30 tokens for $10 (essentially, the same thing). So I order 30 tokens, and they try to charge me sales tax. WHAT?   I am not paying an additional $0.52 for you to convert my money into your spendable version of money, when I would not pay that at the machine.  That's ridiculous. I asked for change and did it myself at the machine.   Most Chuck E. Cheese's that I have been to have the little token cups sitting at the token machine. Not this one. I sent my kid up to the guy at the front entrance to ask for one, and despite the fact that he had a stack of them right there, he actually sent her to go wait in line at the cash register to ask the cashier for one. Seriously?  Are you kidding me? I saw the whole thing and was really irritated.   A lot of the machines don't cash out the number of tickets that they say they will be cashing out. I think they bank on the fact that kids aren't really paying attention to that. A couple of the games were out of order. The characters at the front never turned on to "perform" like they do at other ones. They don't have the Chuck E TV thing with the green screen going on up there either.   The one thing I will give this place... at least it is clean.

I wanted so badly to give this place a 5 star rating, but I have a hard time giving it a 5 because the price really is unfair, especially for toddlers and adults.  One adult should be free with each kid.  Charging $11 for me to chase my kids around this place is ridiculous. Charging me $11 for my toddler, also not cool.  He is really only big enough to appreciate like half of it. He should be half price.   But my older children (two eight year olds and a four year old) had a blast. They ran all over the playground which is absolutely the coolest thing ever. I wish it wouldn't let out on the third floor, because it made me nervous that my four year old would wander off out of my sight, and they don't have any system in place to make sure that adults leave with the children they belong with.    The bike area is really cool too.  The noodle forest is really, really cool. Kids had a blast.

Pizza is delicious. Not quite as good as NY, but almost. Wish there was room for tables.

We had ordered slices of pizza at Secret Pizza also in the Cosmopolitan and were looking for somewhere to sit and eat it. Which seriously was only going to take 3 minute.  They have seats outside the restaurant here, kind of in the walk way. They look like places to wait for a table. We sat down and the bar tender let us know right away those seats were for customers. I said, "Okay, we will order drinks."  I look at the menu and realize that the menu sucks. Nothing on tap. Just way overpriced mixed drinks and bottled beers and sodas. We ordered 2 bottled Mexican cokes and a beer. I get them and sit down and within seconds the hostess is all over me with a totally cranky tone. "Are you going to order something?"  Seriously? I just spent $21 on three beverages to sit here. Back the hell off.   Mind you... There was NO ONE in this outside waiting area the entire time we were there (which was all of 5 minutes). No one came up. It was Saturday night when it should have been busy, but it wasn't at all.   If the hostess had walked over and just started a friendly conversation, I might have wanted to return later in the weekend for a meal.   Instead, this collectively made me want to avoid Cosmopolitan all together.

Visiting from out of town and went to this place.  Menu is crazy diverse.  We are vegetarian and although the menu doesn't look vegetarian friendly, they adapted meals for us. We got the chicken Alfredo without meat. It has a tomato cream sauce that was very filling. Excellent service. The house wine was amazing.

With all the great comments on Yelp on the variety of the menu, I kind of expected a more diverse menu, but it is actually kind of all the small side.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and requested that they make them easy on the spinach and kale, more cheese, since I'm not a huge fan of spinach or kale. They did a great job.  This was a great way to force myself to eat some kale, and I actually liked it better than if it was just a cheese enchilada.  The rice and beans were actually quite good too.   The service was excellent as well. Our server had to go to the kitchen to ask a lot of questions about the menu, but then she admitted to us that she actually was sort of moonlighting here -- she is a waiter at another restaurant and is just helping out because they had a big event here this evening. I'm really glad that they did make a point to have extra wait staff, because we had no trouble getting excellent service.   Really like the overall ambiance of this place.
