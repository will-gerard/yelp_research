I wish there were negative stars that I could give on here! Worst experience ever! We just finished dinner here for my birthday and not only did our services suck but the food was even worse! The corn and carrots tasted like they were boiled in dirty water and that water seeped onto my very tough steak. YUCK! So we complained about it and the manager asked if he could bring us out another one but we were no longer hungry from how disgusting  the food tasted. So we sat with our meals in front of us for a good 20 min. When the bill came our steaks were still on it. When we asked the manager to take it off he argued with me telling me that if he had something to take back to the kitchen he could do something.... they just cleared our table. Finally he took them off when we said we might come back but I really don't think that's going to happen. Learn how to handle a complaint.

What an amazing little place! I got the turkey and cranberry sandwich with a coffee today from there and it was to die for! I will definitely be going back for more! We need more little local cafes like this one.

Some girlfriends and I were in old town one night and we took one of the "gypsy" cabs home by mistake and got charged up the back end by a man that could not speak English and took us around in loops. The next week we called Chris with AZ ELite. I will never take another car service home! Chris was polite, punctual, knew the city well, and he is safe! If you ever need a car service this is the one to take... thank you so much Chris!!

It was our first time eating there and not only was the food amazing but the service was wonderful as well.... little bit of a wait for a table but well worth it! Our server Shelby walked us through how the menu work and made sure we enjoyed every bit of our food. She also acknowledged that we had got engaged and got us dessert and yelled it out to the restaurant. If you like crab, lobster, and great service this place is a must try!
