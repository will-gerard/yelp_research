We just bought our first Audi at Audi North Scottsdale.  I love the car and the process...it was the easiest and BEST car buying experience I have ever had! Brian and Nancy fantastic - knowledgeable, professional, and thorough.

It's a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm, so the fam decides to grab a burger and relax on the patio. Well, we relaxed alright...for 45 minutes waiting for our food to come (which never did). Apparently the computers went down and our order was lost. The waiter apologized, but we waited and waited while tables that came AFTER us were served. Our kids were hungry (and so were we), so we left with empty stomachs and a bad taste in our mouth.  My advice...don't bother.
