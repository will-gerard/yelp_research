Best tailor in town.  Excellent work and always comes through when you need him.  I've had pants, suits, jeans and shirts tailored here and i've always been impressed.  Highly recommended!   As some others have mentioned the parking is rough, only three spots.  And he's always busy, but that's to be expected.

After a night out drinking and being completely hungover my GF and just wanted to relax in bed all day, order a bunch of food and watch movies.  I've heard great things about the food at Cheba hut so we decided to give it a shot.  The girl that took our order struggled a bit to get it right, although it wasn't difficult, the 5-0 in the mist with no tomatoes, the AK-47 with aus jus dipping sauce, nachos and a rice crispy treat.  The food came pretty quickly, about 30 minutes, but one sandwich was loaded with tomatoes, and the other was missing the aus jus sauce, so 0 for 2 on the sandwich order.  We quickly called back and they offered to bring some more aus jus sauce and remake the sandwich.  Not wanting to cause to much trouble I opted to just pick the tomatoes off, but asked if they could still deliver the missing sauce.  They promised a quick delivery.  But an hour later, still no delivery of the sauce.  The sauce totally makes that sandwich!  Sad to say a cant really tell if you if the food was good, I hate tomatoes and one sandwich was covered in them, and the other was missing the best part, the aus jus dipping sauce!  At least the rice crispy treat was good.  By the way, we never did get that sauce delivery.

Jack, is the owner. He's always done great work for me at a great price. I took my car to Scottsdale Porsche once and wasn't happy with the service. Came here and got great service. He also wont do work that doesn't need to be done. He is usually super busy though, I had to wait about a week to get in.  I wont go anywhere else!

Hit or miss with food...  The drinks can be the same way.  The turkey burger is excellent, the ahi tuna sliders are great!  Service is decent, the crowd is mixed.  Certainly a bit overpriced at 50$ for lunch for 2.

After reading mostly good reviews my GF and decided we'd give it a shot.  We ordered the kung pow beef, hot and sour soup, shrimp fried rice, crab wantons and orange chicken.  The beef was good... The hot and sour soup wasn't even edible... Shrimp fried rice was decent at best... Crab wontons were pretty good...  The orange chicken was dry and pretty nasty...  I wouldn't recommend this place. I will say however that the delivery was timely and the delivery guy was cheerful!
