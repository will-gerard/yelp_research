Amazing staff! One thing that is crucial, alongside good care (which they also have) is the love they show your furbabies when you bring them in. This office truly has it all! I have 2 babies that I have been bringing here for about a year. They can get you in quick if necessary, they call after an appointment to find out how your baby is doing if they had an illness and they truly do care about your animals. Sadly, we had to put one of ours down 3 weeks ago, that is when they showed their true colors. It was a very difficult decision but they made me feel so much better during the whole process. They reassured me that this was the best choice for her and that they would surround her with love in her last moments. I couldn't bring myself to see her one last time and they eased the pain I was feeling by letting me know that they had been by her side ever since I had dropped her off that morning and that she knew how loved she was. It was pretty amazing how much they made us feel at ease in our time of sadness. Before I left they gave me a clay imprint of her paw, which was one of the sweetest things I could've ever asked for to remember her by. A couple days later I received a card in the mail signed and personalized by all of their staff! Definitely bring your pets here, they truly do love and care for them like their own!  RIP Maya

You better be reading EVERY single fine line on every piece of paper this dealership hands to you to sign. We went in with a pre approved loan through the company that had backed our last loan (the company was even one of larry millers "preferred" companies) they told us 5+ times that they could get us a bigger loan and lower interest rate by running his credit we told them no repeatedly. They finally gave up and we came to an agreement, or so we thought. Turns out one of the papers we ended up signing after we bought the truck had a credit clause that said they could run his credit, which they never ever mentioned. We made Carl explain every detail of the paperwork as we went over it. Happy with our purchase we went home with the truck. When we went to go make our first monthly payment the company we thought we had went through told us we didn't have a loan with them, Larry Miller Dodge had 4 other companies run his credit and put us with a TOTALLY different company for our loan and not to mention with changed terms. When we confronted them with why they had never told us about any of this they simply asked, "Did anyone get hurt? Physically or financially? Bottom line is we need to go with the company that's going to get us our money quickest." Anybody that I know will never buy a vehicle from here and I suggest you don't either

Everything here is good! Trust me you cannot go wrong. My favorite is their Crusted Mac n' Cheese and their Mozzarella Encorozza appetizer....delish! A must try is the Vitamin V Martini, you won't be disappointed! If you're lucky enough to catch Mitch or Mike here be sure to thank them for opening up one of the best restaurants in AZ!  Don't forget to order the dessert pizza at least once in your life, ah-mazing.

Not sure why everyone else has such awful reviews? Went in on a Friday afternoon around 2:30 and the guy at the front desk was very helpful and really nice. I was shipping out Valentine's Day packages to my nieces and nephews some in other states. I sent out the ones in different states (obviously) but he explained to me the ones who lived in state would still take almost 5 days to get there because they go to a completely different state first and then come back to AZ. Weird but that's how it works ! After all this I decided to deliver those myself since it seemed to be cheaper and faster , he cancelled my transaction and was very nice about it too. I had a great experience .

Just had my wedding at Venue at the Grove in February. One word, amazing. Of course planning a wedding is stressful and you don't truly know how many little things go into making the big day perfect until crunch time! We had a few hang ups in the beginning with communication and then we stressed about the time the festivities had to be done by cause we love to have fun (in the end it ended up being the perfect time) but I kept on them and then BAM! Our knight in shining armor Kyle came in. He was amazing and did I mention amazing ? He handled everything and made me feel 110% confident that everything would be perfect on the day of. We talked in so much detail it really made me appreciate even more how much truly goes into these things. He went above and beyond my expectations when we figured out that my seamstress for my wedding dress didn't put a bustle in :/ he tried for so long to figure it out and try to remedy the situation. My aunt and sisters had it covered in the end but the fact that he was concerned and tried to fix it made me even more thankful for him. He is funny, personable and knows what he's doing. This company is lucky to have him! I believe that he is moving into a little different position with the company and will be overseeing a few other venues but anyone under his supervision is sure to excel! My wedding was literally picture perfect (on the outside that is ;) of course many things didn't go as planned but hey that's the name of the game. Get married here if it's everything you ever imagined cause after everything is said and done it is all that and more !

Reserved a unit for a great price online with a great discount for 2 months as well. Fast and easy! Received a call from Jim the property manager within about 30 minutes, he was helpful and polite and made an appointment with me to come down and set up everything for my storage unit. He was even more friendly and nice when we showed up to take care of everything. Picked out a great location for our unit and showed it to us, had some dirt in it from never being rented but if your from AZ you know this is nothing to be upset about! He drove over and swept up our storage unit before we moved a couple of boxes in. Didn't realize this place was so huge! Go 50% off 2 months of month to month lease, can't beat that! Come rent a storage space here!

Best coffee ever! If you are looking for a good, no frills, no pumpkin spice, no cafe mocha stuff just a hot cup of joe this is your place. Cream and sugar keeps it simple. And it's 4 x's cheaper than Starbucks  nice ladies that work inside too they always seem to make me a fresh cup of coffee and if it's not well it seems like it !
