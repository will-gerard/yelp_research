2:30pm:  40 minute wait to get into center and after 45 minutes I am still waiting to get out of the parking lot.  Go to North Scottsdale - would be faster  3:54 pm:  still here.  The only way out of this mall is a helicopter.

Excellent care.  Dr Perez is a patient and good listener.  He took the time to FULLY understand what was going on with me and collaboratively align on treatment options.  I am very impressed!  The team in the office were very friendly and professional.  I think I found my new doctor in Scottsdale
