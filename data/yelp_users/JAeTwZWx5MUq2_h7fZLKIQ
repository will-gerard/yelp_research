I gave Le Peep 4 stars because they have great smoothies!!  This is one of 2 breakfast places I frequent on the weekends.  They have been going through some tough times lately because of the light rail construction, so busy times are hit-or-miss.  Generally around brunch time on the weekends its not too bad, but every once in a while you will hit them at their busy time.    Generally I get really good service at Le Peep.  Lately however it has been slow, bad, or not at all.  I used to see the owner there working every time I went in, but haven't seen her in several months, so I don't know if it was sold to someone else or what.  After I stopped seeing her there  is when I started seeing the servers come and go and the service get worse.  I find the breakfast food pretty good, and like I said the smoothies are great.  I have not had anything for lunch there.  I can recommend the french toast or the mini veggie omelet which is awesome!  They have pretty good coffee and their prices are reasonable.  To top it all off, they give you punch cards good toward free meals.    Le Peep seems to be going through some tough times right now, but I'm sticking with them for my weekend breakfast and I recommend them to anyone in the Central Phoenix area looking for something better than your other choice.....IHOP.

I'm not a runner, but I like to workout and do a lot of walking.  Years ago when I was cross training for cycling I desperately needed a good pair of shoes.  I had heard nice things about the Runners Den and knew they had been around for years, so rather than buying another pair of crappy shoes off the net, I decided to give them a try.    I went in with a pair of New Balance in mind, but after discussing my shoe goals with the sales associate and having him take a look at my feet he informed me that New Balance wasn't a way to go.  At no time did I ever feel he was doing this to try to sell me a more expensive pair of shoes.  He explained that because of  he way my arch was Asics would be the best choice.  He showed me the options in  my price range that would best fit my needs, let me try them on and walk, hop and run on them outside the shop.  They felt good, so I made my purchase.    Because of the friendly and knowledgeable staff I've made every purchase of new cross trainers at the Runners Den.  Their location is pretty convenient, good prices and a pretty good selection of shoes, clothing and other supplies.

This is one of our old favorite standards, and I'm constantly amazed at how many meat-eaters enjoy it too!    We usually try to go for lunch because we love the lentil soup they serve that only comes with the lunch combo.  We usually order something of the same...springrolls and either lemon grass chicken (excellent!), sweet and sour pork, or New York chicken.  Today we were adventurous and tried one of their new menu items, the garlic chicken....wow...it was awesome!  I think it just replaced the lemon grass chicken on my favorites list!  We also checked out their chow mein so we could have some veggies and it was very good as well....a great combo.  They have recently changed the names of their menu items, which I think might be confusing to people because some of the names don't have anything to do with what the actual dish is!  But don't be afraid to ask, the staff is very friendly and they won't be afraid to recommend a dish to you.  The only thing I hate about veggie house is that they are closed on Sunday and Monday!!! =(

I'm not a huge fan of the Pad Thai at this place (see other reviews about my pickyness), but they have a great curry noodle dish!  This isn't something you would find at most Thai establishments here in the valley....yellow curry with mixed veggies and noodles...yum!  Their cute little springs rolls are pretty good too along with the veggie curry and of course sticky rice mango for dessert!  Not too heavy on your pocket and the owner, who is almost always there, is super friendly...if you go there as much as we have she will remember you and your order.  Location is kind of a strange, in an old strip mall in between the Real bar and one of those second-chance high schools.  If you can find it, enjoy!!

Mi Patio has long been one of my favorite places for Mexican food.  Why you may ask?  Well I first started going there long ago when the margaritas were $1.25...now they are $1.75 but you can still go drink all day for cheap...keep in mind these ARE $1.75 margaritas, so it may take you a few to get your buzz on!   What keeps me coming back though is the food, the price, and the service.    First of all the food and the price:  Is it going to win any awards for being the top notch mexican place in the Valley?  Probably not, but it's pretty darn good and better than dreadful old Macayo's or any of the other big chains.  And the value is excellent too!  For $22 two people can fill up on endless chips and salsa, enjoy a full plate dinner each, along with 2 drinks and fried ice cream for dessert!  My favorite is the Spinach Enchalada...anything there with the Baja sauce is mucho bueno!!  As for the service, I'm a big fan of small mom and pop type businesses, and I try to support them whenever I can.  I've been going to Mi Patio for about 9 years now and the same people working there today are the same people who were serving me way back when.  The owner is always friendly whenever he is there just hanging out and chatting with you, and its neat to see the same young men grow from bus boys to servers.  To me this says the employees are happy and treated well, and thats the kind of business I like to support!  The ambiance of Mi Patio is very colorful, and family friendly.  There is a bar, along with a smoking and non-smoking section.  It is usually pretty busy around the dinner hour no matter what day of the week, but I have never gone there and had to wait long for a table, if at all.    If you are looking for a quiet romantic sort of place, keep looking because once this place fills up it starts rockin!

Ok, so when I'm not eating cheese pizzas I'm eating Thai Food.  Much like pizza, Thai (or almost any Asian cuisine)  is something I could eat almost everyday and being a vegetarian Thai food has a lot of options for me.  Why am I telling you this?  Cause eating a lot of Thai food makes me picky.    Whenever I try any new Thai place I stick with one of two standards: Pad Thai or Green Curry.  If you are a Thai restaurant and cannot handle either of these dishes, then you should just close down shop now.  As for Thai Rama, they do both very well.  I'll even go as far as to say Thai Rama is my favorite Thai food in the valley.  It's near my home, open late and the staff is really friendly.    I've eaten here for years and my favorite is the Pad Thai with fried tofu....dare I say the best in the valley??  I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side, not fishy tasting with some flavor, and most Thai places here have the more "traditional" type.  If you like it spicy, this place can comply so watch out!  Their green veggie curry is flavorful, with a good assortment of veggies.    My only complaints would be their hot and sour soup, which is ok but WAY too much ginger flavor...to the point that I couldn't enjoy it.  Also, like so many other Thai places, they tempt you with the mango sticky rice only to never have mango!!!  When they do, its awesome, otherwise settle for the custard sticky rice which is almost as good.

By far this is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley!  Listen to me people, lets keep this simple, Kohinoor style.    If you are looking for a super-fancy, sitar playing, well decorated place to eat then move on because this ain't that type of Indian food joint! However, if you are looking for awesome traditional Indian food at an EXCELLENT price, then this is the place for you!  Kohinoor is located right by ASU in Tempe, so all you college students pay attention, because if I was in school over there I'd be eating at this place all semester long.  It's open until 11pm 7 days a week, and includes the restaurant and a bakery.    When you enter Kohinoor, it's a no fuss kind of place so don't be afraid and seat yourself.  You will be entertained by the big screen television showing one of many interesting Indian soap operas or movies.  Don't be surprised if you are surrounded by a few Indian families, or students because they know good Indian food, and to me that says Kohinoor is the best!  Your server will soon be around with a pitcher of water and two menus for you.  One is the traditional menu you see at most places, appetizers, etc.  The other is your ticket to a great meal...a yellow, single sided, laminated menu with their "specials".  Unless you are ordering an appetizer, stick with the yellow menu.  It's divided into Vegetarian, Chicken, and Lamb dinners, all with about 8 or 9 options...$3.99, $4.99, and $5.99 respectively!  These are no small dinners either people!  These dinners include the main dish, jasmine rice, naan, a lentil side, a chickpea side, and yogurt!  For $1 more you can add a mango lassi.  For dessert you are welcome to request one of the many items from the bakery, but there will be more than enough food with your meal to fill you up, so be sure to bring your appetite!!  When you are done gorging yourself and have had enough of the day's feature soap opera, just head up to the cashier and tell them what you had, pay, and you are done!  I guarantee you will have some of the best Indian food ever, at THE best price ever, leaving stuffed and happy!  You'll never want to pay $40 for an Indian meal again!

Holy overrated Batman!  I've eaten here twice...once several years ago and once just about a month ago...and nothing has changed.  You still have to wait, even if you can get a reservation, the ambiance is horrible, and the selection is limited.  I'm a picky person about my pizza, and don't get me wrong, I enjoy all of the food at Biancos.....however is the best pizza I've ever had?  No....is it better than what you find in New York?  No....is it worth the 4 hour wait?  God no.  Do yourself a favor....save a couple hours of your life and go down the street to Cibo's....the pizza is just as good, salads and desserts are better, atmosphere is better and the longest I've ever waited there was an hour.

Cibo is awesome!  Housed in an old downtown Phoenix home, it has charm and class...good as both a date night hot spot and a casual lunch stop, anybody fits in.  Also has a small bar and outdoor seating (with heaters for the winter).  The pizza, salads and dessert are all fantastic, they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour. I guess my only complaints would be the parking...just like anywhere else downtown it's limited; and it can get a bit loud inside when it's busy.   Thinking about taking your date/out of town guests to Biancos?  Don't bother...head over to Cibos for better food, better atmosphere, and a shorter wait.

This place has hands-down become my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix.  The coffee and cupcakes are awesome, the atmosphere is equally as good, and with free wi-fi and comfortable seating this one of my favorite places to do homework or just chill.  The only issue this place has is the parking.  There are literally 2 off-street parking spots, and the rest is park at the curb...lucky me I am one of the fortunate ones living within walking (or biking) distance.  The coolest thing about this place though is Bill the owner, and the rest of his friendly staff.  I've frequented other coffee shops in the area, and don't frequent them anymore specifically because of the pretentious, snobby staff at those establishments.  From the first day I walked in to Copper Star however, Bill was super friendly striking up a conversation and really making me feel welcome.  His staff always seems to be in a good mood, and if they are coffee snobs like me they don't ever show it.  If you haven't been here yet, stop what you are doing and go check it out now!

Wake up people, if you are looking for good pizza and you haven't been to Cafe Roma then you better get down there!!  This pizza is cooked by a Sicilian woman for crying out loud!  Average?  Whateva!  There are a few locations of Cafe Roma, the only other one I have been to is the one in Tempe which was good but not quite the same.  Go to this one, at the AZ Center, order a whole pizza and enjoy.  They have a huge menu and I'm sorry to say that we haven't tried anything else on it because the pizza is so tasty we just cannot resist!!  They serve slices as well, but you know those have been sitting behind the glass for who knows how long and although I'm sure they are good as well, nothing compares to a freshly made pizza.  I'm also not sure what Jonathan B.'s gripe is with waiting so long...we have never waited longer than 10 mins and for a fresh pizza I think thats pretty average.  For around $13 we get a large cheese and 2 drinks.  They also serve beer, wine and other alcohol but not a huge selection and they do have happy hour specials.  They also have two tvs that always have at least one of the local games on.  My only complaint is that they are not open very late (830 I believe) and they don't have their hours posted anywhere.    This place was dangerous when I actually lived downtown, I'm glad to be a little up the road now so I'm no longer eating pizza everyday!!  ASU students!  Downtown workers!  Drunk hipsters!  Make your way to Cafe Roma!

Sadly, the family that originally owned Cafe Roma sold this location off.  We have only experienced it once since then and have no plans on going back.  Although I like the way the new owners updated the location, they pretty much took great pizza and replaced it with the cheapest ingredients possible and then jacked up the prices.  We didn't even want to finish what we had ordered.  We took it to go and gave it away to a homeless person.

I will continue to support Smelly Dog over that Wag N Wash place, because the people at Smelly Dog just rock!  They are independent, and were established there first whereas Wag N Wash is a chain and moved in right down the street!  Boo!  Seriously though the staff at Smelly Dog are just awesome, they really love our dogs and take very good care of them.  I can always get them down there at the last minute for a wash even if its just before they close.  One time a few years ago my dog Caesar ran away and when I found him he was covered in the most nasty, sticky, smelly garbage ever...I took him down to Smelly Dog and they had to wash him 3 times, but never charged me extra...I tipped big that day!  Smelly Dog also has a doggie day care facility which is nice with sofas and tv's and a play area...and the staff plays with the dogs all day!  They also do a fundraiser every year to support bulletproof vests for police dogs.  These guys are awesome!  Shame on you Nadia for going to Wag N Wash!  Who writes something like that in a review??  Support local businesses!  Go to Smelly Dog!!

We recently moved up to Sunnyslope, so the search was on for a new Indian Restaurant and India Palace was it.  We enjoyed it so much that when they moved over to the new location on Bell Road we followed.    They have all the typical Indian fare, although we only eat the veggie stuff so I can't comment on the meat dishes.  Their Mali Kofta is wonderful with amazing sauce including cashews and raisins and they are more than willing to add Paneer to your Aloo Matter (if you're into that kind of thing).  Great samosas and pakoras, and if you go for dinner they will start you off with some Poppadums and salsa with chutney.    I think India Palace has one of the best Indian Buffets, but that is mainly based off the fact that their buffet always includes a large selection of veggie dishes, almost more than the meat selection! They also always have some interesting selections that you may not see on the menu like Chili Tofu and Curried Pasta.  It's all you can eat including the naan and hot Indian Tea.  Its always busy at lunch time and there is a reason why.  It is located in the corner of a strip mall, but once you enter you wouldn't know thats where you were, as the restaurant itself is very nice on the inside.  The staff is very friendly and if you go as often as we do you will get to know them all because they are always there!!  They also have restaurants in Sedona and Flagstaff, although I recently heard they were going to be selling those and just keep the one in Phoenix.   Enjoy!

I was on a search last night to find a vegan ice cream spot for a friend that wasn't frozen yogurt, and stumbled upon Chill!  This place has an awesome selection of both vegan and non-vegan gelato, root beer floats, toppings and more.  Much more than your standard ice cream spot.  The service was friendly and we both really enjoyed our selections; me the mint chocolate chip/dark chocolate, friend the mango.    We were expecting the typical couple of scoops so both went for the large...go large at your own risk because they pack it in there!!!  I was on gelato overload by the time I was done but it was so so good I couldn't stop eating it!    A good amount of seating inside, a nice place to hang out for your after dinner dessert or on a hot Phoenix day.  Enjoy!!!

Wow, I'm actually really surprised to see all of the negative posts here!  We recently moved back down to SoMo and have eaten at Pan Asia about half a dozen times since August.    I've never had a bad food experience at this place and tonight was no exception! Our favorite things to order are the Crispy Tofu (melts in your mouth with an awesome Kung Pao sauce), veggie fried rice and their Las Vegas Rolls.  I've had several sushi dishes here and they were all great, no issues with freshness.  The decor is nice and its a pretty big place with a nice bar.  They always have good coupon deals and a nice happy hour.  This would be a great place to meet friends after work or catch a game because they always have the sports channels on.  Not to mention they are open pretty late even on weekdays.  We have always had friendly service, although on one occasion they were obviously short a server so the hostess was helping out which made things a bit slow - but this happens at every restaurant at least once.  The chef even offered to make us Mu Shu vegetables one night after we inquired if we had missed it on the menu.  I always leave this place having eaten too much!  There are lots and lots of food establishments in this area of SoMo....but hardly any really good ones.  Pan Asia is one of those good ones.  Forget Sun Asian Kitchen down the road!!  Go to Pan Asia and support one of the few good restaurants in the area!

I continue to be surprised at some of the negative reviews about the food here. This place has become a staple in our neighborhood diet for the last 3 years. We have tried several different items on their menu from soup to appetizers to sushi and the main dishes... And remain impressed! We often bring out of town guests here for dinner and they have all enjoyed what was ordered.   The service has gotten better over the years, although they do sometimes seem shorthanded... I think some of this is compounded by the fact that you never can tell when it will be busy here and when it won't. For example one Sunday night it will be dead and another it will be packed. The place is clean and they have great happy hour specials.

So I came here for lunch based on the reviews and the proximity to my work. There is not a lot of good fast food in the area so I was excited to try it. The reviews on the location are correct, it's in a small hoody strip, but that's usually where the best food is found right?   I got there around 1130a and was the only person in the joint. I wasnt sure they were actually open because they had no food out in the cases, but I did eventually find a few small pies sitting out. I ordered a couple of slices and waited. When the food finally came, it was really disappointing. I swear it was frozen pizza or something. The crust was rubbery and awful. The sauce had little flavor. I forced my way through the first slice because I knew I wouldn't have time to grab anything else to eat on my short lunch break... But I couldn't bare to even begin the second. I threw the rest away and went back to work.   One person did come in to pick up a pizza to go while I was there, so perhaps the freshly made pies are much better... But I won't be going back to give it a second chance.

Its hard to find a good mechanic in this town, but Mike at German Autowerks is the man when it comes to your VW/Audi.  I came to Mike under the recommendation of several members of a local VW club after I had a very unsavory experience with another local VW mechanic.  I drive an 85 Vanagon with a 90 Jetta diesel conversion, so it was important to me to find someone who knew these vehicles inside and out.  Mike has been working on VW diesels and vans since the 70's.    I have limited maintenance history on the van, but I put together a spreadsheet of all the receipts I had from the previous owner....the other mechanic I provided this to didn't even take a look at it....but Mike went over it in great detail so he could understand better what was going on.  The other mechanic told me I just needed to replace the rotors and pads on my brakes, but after Mike looked at it he determined they needed a complete overhaul...and called me to tell me why BEFORE he started the work.  He has completed several big maintenance items for me on the van, always sitting down with you when you go to pick it up and going over each item in detail, what he found, and what you may need to look out for in the future.  I also find his prices to be more than reasonable.    I'm so happy to have finally found a competent VW mechanic and will continue to take my van to Mike as long as he is in business!!

I don't write many reviews anymore, but Chanpen Thai was so inspiring I just had to contribute!  South Phoenicians and Tempe residents rejoice, because this is seriously the best Thai food I've had in quite some time, possibly ever!  Anyone who knows anything about food understands that its the little hole-in-the-wall shops that are the best and this place is no different.  I'm honestly a little worried about when the word gets out because its such a small location, they will easily be packed.    We ordered some of our favorite standards: fresh veggie rolls with tofu, veggie pad thai and veggie panang curry.  Everything was seriously amazing.  Even the heat was just right...we ordered everything at a 3 on a 0-5 scale and it was perfect.  The curry flavor and creaminess plus the veggie selection and giant tofu chunks was the best panang I've ever had.  The pad thai was exceptional, again with the giant tofu chunks.  Serving sizes were great.  I was hoping to try dessert, but the food was so phenomenal I couldn't stop eating it!    They have a pretty extensive menu, and it sounds like they are pretty much willing to make anything the way you want it.  They asked us if we wanted to add tofu to the fresh rolls even though it wasn't on the menu, and made sure egg was ok in the pad thai.  Their lunch specials also look good for $6.    We were also told that on Friday and Saturdays they will be offering DELIVERY!  We are in trouble.

This place is great...friendly staff, beautiful facilities, clean locker rooms, a rock wall and indoor track.  The track is about 1/10 of a mile each lap, so small but a haven for those of us who hate running on treadmills especially in the summer.  They offer a lot of classes and events and the weight room has just about everything you need. This is the best kept secret in the valley...I've never had to wait for a machine or deal with your typical gym bros taking pictures of themselves in the mirror every 5 minutes. I'm giving 4 stars only because the free weights are not as nice as what you'd find at a larger chain gym, and I wish they would go back to opening at 6am.  That half hour makes a huge difference in my schedule!  But these are just personal needs, YMMV.

This has become my go to breakfast spot on the weekends. I discovered it when I made the mistake of venturing out the morning of Fathers Day trying to find a place that wasn't a 45 min wait. It was busy but I was still able to grab a spot. The menu is simple diner food, but in my opinion steps above Joes Diner up the street in terms of quality and taste. The service has always been great for me! The diner itself is fun and cute and a great way to meet neighborhood locals.

We were purchasing a new-to-us vehicle located in Southern California, under a small window of opportunity.  It was way too expensive to fly out at such short notice and we did not want to pay for driving two cars back so we looked into doing a one-way rental.  Fox was by far the cheapest out of any of the companies, but we were hesitant to book based on the reviews here.  In the end we decided the price was too good to ignore and we booked with Fox.  In short, our experience was great.  We picked up the car at 8am from the Sky Harbor location and although we were not the first in line the wait was only about 15 minutes.  The girl at the desk was very happy and friendly, stating that it was a great job and she had been there for about 15 years!  I'm not sure what the issues are with the other reviews here but maybe the key is arriving first thing in the morning if you can to avoid heavy lines.    The vehicle, a Chevy Aveo, was in good condition and clean with no funky odors.  We did not have any mechanical problems with the car, however the gas mileage was not as good as we had hoped and the vehicle did not come with cruise control! Guess we should have gone for the upgrade.  The only thing we had problems with was finding the drop-off facility in Santa Barbara.  They gave us no indication where it was on the Phoenix end even though it said the location was John Wayne Airport.  After driving around a bit I finally looked it up on google maps and found that it was not at the airport, but near the airport although a bit hard to navigate to.  When we dropped off, we were in and out in moments with no problems or extra charges.  The guys there did kind of laugh at the price as I guess it was really cheap compared to California rates.  All in all, a good experience and I wouldn't worry about renting from Fox again.
