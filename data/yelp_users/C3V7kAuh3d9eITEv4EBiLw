It's a good place to get a quick (and yummy) lunch. Their pizza's good and the portions are great. They also have sandwiches and soup but pizza's the only thing I've had from their restaurant and I have absolutely no complains.  The staff's nice too.  Good place to grab a quick bite if you're Downtown Phoenix and want to have some yummy pizza.

Best Mexican food in the valley hands down!!  Their enchiladas are just perfect! As spicy (my mouth's watering now!) as they should be. I find that a lot of Mexican restaurants tone it down when it comes to the level of spiciness they add to their food, to match some American taste buds, I guess but not Carolina's! I've been living in the valley for 8 years now (moved from California) and this is the best Mexican food in the Phoenix metropolitan area.   Their tortillas... HUGE. And I mean it... HUGE, biggest tortillas I've ever seen. They look like XL pizzas! And don't you think they're big only. They're big and flavorful. Reason why they've won awards before.  Now, say it with me: TA-MA-LES. You've never had a better one than the ones they make at Carolina's. Seriously. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I could eat there every day for the rest of my life.

My husband got a Groupon deal for me to stay at this resort as this was my Xmas wish (a night by myself).  The resort itself is dated but charming. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was remodeled and pretty but the tub didn't drain properly. I suspect the plumbing in the building may  need to be redone.  The Groupon had a $50 food credit voucher towards any food place in the premises (taxes and tips not included) so we decided to go to Sangria's Lounge for Happy Hour. Our drinks were fine but we ordered the garlic, red pepper hummus and we were extremely disappointed. The hummus was completely tasteless and it came with stale pita bread. When we inquired about the bread, we were told that they were "pita chips" but we know they weren't. Pita chips are crunchy. This was just plain hard pita bread. They offered to give us something else but we didn't wanna try anything else at that point.  At night, I decided to order room service which is, obviously, overpriced but extremely convenient. The phone in their room, though, wasn't working so I had to use my cell phone to call the reception and have them transfer me to the room service department. They offered to have someone come and look at my phone (and change it) but I didn't feel like dealing with that at that point. Food arrived quickly and it was hot. It was served on a cute tray with a little flower. Pretty.   The next morning, I decided to check out using their check out service on their bedroom TV and a couple of days ago I realized there was a $39 charge being added to my credit card and I didn't know why. I called yesterday and left a message and got no reply so  today I called several times to talk to someone in the accounting department because I was being charged $39 and I didn't know why. After 4 attempts and 3 voicemails, I was ready to give up and to dispute this transaction with my bank but they finally answered and they said the issue was that when you check out on their TVs from their rooms, the system doesn't figure out how to charge your food to your room so they were charging me for the room service I ordered and that they, unfortunately haven't figured out yet how to fix this issue. He was very nice and attentive and he apologized for the mistake.  So, overall, the experience was alright, only. The Groupon deal cost $190 so I was expecting MORE for the price. Even with the $50 food voucher.  OK food, a phone not working properly, bad plumbing and the overcharge on my credit card will probably make me choose a different place to stay next time.

After the bad experience during mt 1st stay at this hotel, the manager was kind enough to contact me to apologize and to offer a complimentary night based on availability so I booked for last Friday the 7th to celebrate my bday with my husband.  We were given a very spacious room with a king size bed and were pleasantly surprised by a staff member knocking on the door to drop off a birthday card and a basket full of goodies as a birthday present for me.  I loved this! I remember mentioning I specifically wanted March 7th because I wanted to celebrate my birthday but I didn't expect the manager to remember or to do anything special (other than offering a complimentary night which is already very nice to begin with).   We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't give my opinion regarding food but the surroundings of the hotel at night are gorgeous. Tons of lights illuminate the trees and it was very nice to walk around. At night,  the fire pits offer the opportunity to sit by the fire and relax.  Some of the premises were reserved for some type of conference so we couldn't check them all out but it looked like people were hanging out,  relaxed and having fun.   In the morning we took advantage of the coupon for free coffee and had breakfast at the hotel. It was very nice to sit outside and to enjoy the morning breeze while drinking coffee and reading the complimentary paper that was left at our door. We also got a cheese Danish and it tasted deliciously fresh.   All in all, my experience this time was much better.  Thanks for giving me the chance to stay there again!

One star because ZERO stars aren't allowed.  It was our first time back after 5 years. My husband wanted to go somewhere else and I insisted I wanted to go to Denny's.  I didn't come back in five years because they argued with me about giving me french fries with the Philly steak sandwich (it comes with fries, waiter said no and refused to get me any fries). We just left because we spent 5 minutes standing waiting for rhe hostess to be seated and N-O-B-O-D-Y acknowledged us. Not even to ask us to give them a minute.  And they're not even that busy.  Well, guess what? This party of 4 is taking their business to another restaurant.   Sayonara, Dennys.

Let me tell you, I never thought I'd spend that amounf of money on a haircut but VOLR is the place to go and that's where I'm gonna keep going forever and ever! $60 to have the best cut of my life? YES, PLEASE!  AWESOME!!  That was my experience with Alex Razo when I went to VOLR to have a haircut. I had been letting my hair grow for so long so I could donate it (and couldn't in the end, but that's a different story) but Alex listened to my concerns, he looked at the picture I brought he advised me as to what to do to make my hair grow healthy and shiny and they never tried to sell me any products (you get extra points for this! I don't like it when business owners try to sell something else other than what I already wanna buy!).  Alex made me feel at ease. He was trying to be conservative and I needed a change and he did it! He made it happen and I couldn't be happier. I'm TOTALLY going back to VOLR and I'll see Alex when I'm due for a haircut.  Super nice location, next to Lola's Cafe. Very modern decor inside the salon and you pay on an Ipad where you can add the tip and everything else.    SUPER MODERN, STYLISH AND FANCY!!) Me encanta!!

Yummy inexpensive Mexican tortas. Very nice staff and extremely clean location. They also have desserts and pan dulce.  My torta wasn't too big but but was very filling.  Not too spicy,  but spicy enough to make my mouth water as I type this review. I got the carne asada torta and I was served with some potato chips. Delicious!   Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!

This was my first time staying there. One of our friends got us a good deal and 7 of us decided to spend the night there last weekend.   It's a nice resort. The suites have everything you need for a comfortable stay. The kitchen's small but this is a timeshare kinda of resort and so it doesn't matter, really. I imagine there's not a lot of cooking when you're on vacation but still the kitchen was fully equipped. The bathroom was a good size and so was the bedroom. The sofa's a pull out sofa and it's queen size so 4 people can stay there without feeling too cramped.  The pools are nice. There's a smaller pool where kids aren't allowed so it's quiet and relaxing. Then there's the big pool with the hot tub (big hot tub) and a splash pad area too. They also have a bar by the pool. Some of my friends ordered drinks and they say they were delicious!  The resort's clean and the customer service's good. I'll definitely go back soon if I'm capable of doing it.

I really like this place. I've been there only once to celebrate a friend's birthday and we arrived just on time for Happy Hour. Their happy hour menu's pretty good. They offer the regular stuff, drinks and some appetizers but everything we tried was very good.  Cute place for dinner too. Their patio's decorated with lights so it has somehow a "festive" touch but it also makes a cute spot for a date. It's really loud, though and very crowded. We were seating outside but all the tables inside were taken too. If a place is that packed, it can't be bad, right? Give it a try. You'll understand why it has so many good reviews.

First of all I'd like to say our server was extremely nice. Very attentive and he even joked with us and out 4 year old daughter.   I'm giving it two starts because the food's just OK. Maybe if we had been there for breakfast or to get some pie it may have been different. We stopped by to have dinner because my daughter could eat for free (she got a coupon at school). She had mac and cheese and a side of broccoli. The side of broccoli's literally THREE broccoli florets.  My philly cheeseteak was a new item on the menu and it was just OK. I mean, nothing really memorable about it. My husband ordered the tuna melt and he said he wasn't impressed either.   The restaurant was almost empty and our food still took a while. I believe it may be understaffed. There was only one waiter and two tables to wait.

TO DIE FOR!  Let me tell you something. I'm not an ice cream person. I couldn't care less about ice cream, frozen yogurt or anything sweet and cold BUT this place's totally worth a visit. The place was packed (it was a Saturday night) and that's a good sign right there. I mean packed, line getting out of the door kind of packed.   It's so good! Seriously, absolutely delicious ice cream! I tried the lime basil sherbet and it was so refreshing! The coconut sherbet was also very good. But, ultimately, I'm faithful to chocolate mint so that's what I got.  The girl behind the counter asked if I had tried their chocolate chip mint ice cream before because it was "different" than your usual minty ice cream. I said I had never been there before so she offered a sample and WOW, she was right but right in a very positive way!   This is the best ice cream I've ever had- HANDS DOWN! Made with real mint, absolutely and amazingly tasty and refreshing.  Remember I'm not an ice cream person but that ice cream was heavenly delicious.

I absolutely love this Super Target Store. We have a regular Target closer to our house but this Target is as good as it gets (well, a two story Super Target is as good as it gets but hey, this is still VERY nice!).  I stopped by last Saturday to order my daughter's birthday cake. I know they make yummy cakes and they were extremely accommodating with the stuff I needed to make her cake just perfect. She's 3. She needs a perfect cake, you know?  So, anyway, the girl that helped me out at the counter was so helpful. She answered all my questions and she even told me about Cartwheel (a fairly new app I had never used before), that helped me save an extra 10% on top of the 5% I get by using my Red Card and hey, I love a coupon as much as I love my coffee in the morning so of course I'm very thankful for this employee and I'll start using Cartwheel more often now :)   The store itself is big and very clean and organized. They have a small Starbucks store and a bigger PizzaHut popcorn station there too. Huge produce and product variety. You can find anything in there!  Also, there are tons of very nice employees willing to help. You don't have to spend 20 minutes wandering around trying to find someone. I'm a fan!!

We began going to Rubio's 7 years ago when we first moved to the west side and loved their food then.  They've recently changed the menu and I must say, although we don't go that often anymore we love sitting outside when the weather's nice and enjoy our food. I usually have their salad bowl and it's plenty of food (I share with my 3 year old daughter).   Their food's good, it's prepared when ordered and they give little kids a little bag with crayons for them to stay busy.

So sad we're moving and I'll have to find a new OB-GYN!!  I've had two kids (one in 2011 and one in 2015) and both times, they were my Ob Gyn. First I had Dr. Mistie Johnson (she's gone but she was great! She delivered my daughter) and then I had Dr. Phil Harmon (also gone from this practice but also absolutely amazing) If you don't mind having a male OB-GYN I recommend both him and Dr. Raymond Suarez.   My Dr. during this pregnancy was Dr. Suarez but I also had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Geier. I can't say enough good things about her. She was GREAT! She delivered my son 4 months ago. She's knowledgeable, compassionate and she'll listen to you and your concerns. She listened when I was afraid of another preterm labor (I had it with my daughter) and agreed to put me on bedrest for 2 weeks just so I could make sure my baby would be full term. A different doctor from the same office didn't listen to me when I went to the ER. My son was born full term at 40 weeks.  I know every Doctor's different and I know this doctor said at 34 weeks they don't do anything to stop labor. Still, why wouldn't she write a note for me to be able to stay off my feet for 2 weeks in the middle of summer after I explained to her that I had the same issue with my daughter and I was put on bedrest at week 32 because she was trying to come too early is beyond my understanding but Dr. Geier listened to me and made me feel at ease. I just wanted to do whatever possible to make sure my son would be full term. I understand nothing could guarantee it but I know my body and I know I needed to stop the madness I had going on at work for a few days or I'd end up having a preemie.  So ladies, listen to your bodies, do not push it and call this office if you need an OB-GYN. Their staff's also very nice and the nurses get back to you quickly after you call and leave a message.

Food's great here. Service not so much. Last time I went there for lunch with my 6 of my coworkers we waited for one hour, (even after we called and told them a big group was coming for a birthday). We didn't get our drinks refilled and barely got our food 5 min before we had to leave to go back to work and one of our orders got lost/was forgotten (most of us only get a 60 min break for lunch so no time to get lunch sonewhere else). The manager was nice enough to not charge us for our food. I didn't wanna go back during lunch because of what happened to us last time but five of us went back today (again, food here's delicious! ) and we had the same issue again. We waited for 50 min, other tables were served before we got our food (and some of them arrived after we did) and 5 min before leaving, our food arrived. We even sat outside just so we didn't have to wait extra time for a table inside the restaurant.   I understand lunch time's a busy time in the kitchen ans the restaurant was packed but this is a recurrent issue every time we've been there. It's unfortunate because their food is very good. My gyro was yummy and very tender. The garlic potatoes weren't all that great today.   All in all, I don't think I'm coming back. I understand this isn't a fast food chain and it takes time to prepare your order but more servers/cooks during lunch time may be a good investment for this restaurant. I work Downtown and I can get yummy food close by without having to drive/wait for over 45 min to end up either eating super fast before I have to go and not enjoying my food (which is the main reason to get out of the office) or taking my food to go and eating it on my desk, which is what I want to avoid when I go out to eat.

We stopped by yesterday to have some ice cream after we picked up our daughter from daycare.  I had a coupon on my phone for a buy one get one free cone of pumpkin cheesecake flavor. I didn't print the coupon because going there was a last minute decision and I've never had any issues showing coupons on my phone before. The coupon had the PLU code and everything and it came from a reliable website I've used many times with no problems whatsoever.  There were two girls behind the counter but I couldn't get their names. A Hispanic blonde one (not natural blonde) and a dark hair one. The blond one gave us an attitude and even told the dark hair one to tell us to print the coupon next time. I'm not sure why she couldn't have told us herself but I thought it was extremely rude of her to do that. Very passive aggressive, if you ask me.  The dark hair girl was extremely nice. Even when the blonde one typed God knows what on the register and the price of both cones was higher then it should've been, the dark hair girl said that was wrong and fixed it , herself. I was shocked by her behavior.  Our ice cream was delicious. The place's small. There are a few tables and chairs inside the store and a couple of tables outside the store. It's just fine for a quick ice cream stop.  I'm giving it 4 starts because the dark hair girl was very nice to us and she tried to help us while the blonde hair one was just extremely rude. No manners whatsoever. I know it may not be the job of her dreams but she should treat customers a little bit more respectfully.

The Groupon deal my husband got for me to stay at this hotel had a $50 food credit voucher towards any food place in the premises (taxes and tips not included) so we decided to go to Sangria's Lounge for Happy Hour. Several items were priced at $5 each.  Our $5 drinks were fine but we ordered the $5 garlic, red pepper hummus and we were extremely disappointed. The hummus was completely tasteless, even its texture wasn't hummus like and it came with stale pita bread. When we inquired about the bread, we were told that they were "pita chips" but we know they weren't. We know what pita chips are and that wasn't chips, trust me. This was just plain hard pita bread. They offered to give us something else but we didn't wanna try anything else at that point.  We didn't wanna complain anymore at that point because the servers probably work with what they have but their food just isn't good at all.   The place was empty (even for Happy Hour, that should've been a red flag) but the servers were nice, though.  $5happy hour=Five star disappointment.

It's very convenient to have this CVS downtown Phoenix, specially if you work there like I do. I can get meds or pretty much any other thing I need in the middle of the day or at lunch time. Their staff's very nice and helpful and they have everything you can think of in there from candy to diapers, to make up, to alcohol to whatever you need from the pharmacy department.  It's more expensive than my regular store BUT the convenience of being able to walk over there pays off quickly.

We've been there twice because I got coupons to try this place. The food itselfs very good but I'm giving it two stars because the service is not great.  First time we went there we had to wait for over half an hour to get our food. Dont get me wrong,  I know this isn't a fast food place but over 30 min waiting when you travel over here a 1h lunch hour is excessive.   The second time we went we had the same problem or worse.  It was the day after Christmas.  The restaurant didn't open until noon and by that I mean the kitchen was also closed so when we arrived nothing was ready.  We ordered at 12:35pm and got our food again over half an hour later. Because of the coupon we had to spend a certain amount of money so I ordered a sushi roll and I was told it couldn't be done because they were very backed up in the kitchen but a couple that arrived after we did got served first and the got not one but two sushi rolls.  Their teriyaki's good and I guess they make their food when you order hut certain things could be changed. Like if you're gonna open at lunch make the cooks go a little bit earlier to start cooking rice for sushi rolls and for teriyaki plates or lunch specials which include rice, have the soda machine ready to go so customers don't have to wait for minutes and in line to get their drinks and somehow in general speed up the process in the kitchen because it's a shame their food's good but people can't wait half an hour at lunch time to eat and go back to work since some people only get a 30 min lunch.

Let me start by saying I don't use/buy accessories. I'm not one of those girls who accessorizes every single outfit I wear BUT if you like accessories, and colorful jewelry this is the place for you!  Everything's organized by color, they provide you with cute little baskets for you to throw all of your cute colorful stuff in there, it's fairly inexpensive (keep in mind it's not real gold or anything, ok?) and they have not one but two floors for you to have fun shopping.

Very good/fast lunch without being fast food.  The food's good (although lately it's been less spicy, I think) . This restaurant's packed every day for lunch so that's a sign that their food's tasty. I always get the pad thai  and it's to die for!  The only  "negative" part about this restaurant's its size. It's ok for a small group but sometimes we're 10-15 people and we have to go somewhere else due to the fact that they can't accommodate a big group, which is sad because their food's very good and I know all of us really enjoy it.

What a great venue!  I had never been there before until last night. I went to see Jarabe de Palo play and I was so impressed.  They have an outside seating area but the inside's also very cozy and welcoming. Our server was very attentive and very nice. Also very professional.   The food they serve's AMAZING! I got a couple of tacos and they were to die for! I  was pleasantly suprised by how delicious the tacos were! They have a good selection of food and drinks during happy hour and that salsa verde they serve with their chips ($1 during HH, unbeatable! Tons of chips, too!) is so, so, so good!!  Parking is the only issue I have with this place. I'm not sure they do own a lot but you can park on 3rd Ave and Van Buren as there's a big lot there. Just make sure you have cash, $4 to be exact, because it's one of those parking lots with numbered lots where you deposit money on slots.  All in all, it's a very cool place! I really enjoyed the concert and the venue's just great for a concert like that. Location's great as it is Downtown Phoenix and they have a nice Happy Hour. I understand now why this is such a popular place.

This is a very nice restaurant. The open kitchen concept's very cute. You can see them working on your pasta, cutting fresh prosciutto and they have all this freshly baked bread on display (make sure you buy a loaf to go- We did it and had some pesto mozzarella sandwiches at home... Delicious!).  The food's really good and I believe it's priced accordingly to its quality. We were there for brunch on Sunday and everyone enjoyed their meal. We were a big group also so we got to try all kinds of different food but their pizza seems to be the queen (or at least for our table it was!).  Make sure you bring some cash to tip the valet parking guys. There's no parking on the street but their valet parking's free (you just tip and that's it). I'm not a fan of valet parking myself but I understand some people like the convenience/feeling spoiled by having someone else bring your car for you to the door, specially when eating at a nice place like this.  It's a cute place for a date or an anniversary or just because. The food's delicious so just go anytime!

My husband and I decided to take my daughter over here for a try out last Sunday. It usually costs $11 (adults don't pay, which is great because many of these other places make the adults pay a fee to enter and basically watch their kids and it ends up being very expensive for a family to afford something like that) but we got a deal for $6 because it was the first time we were taking her there.  The place itself is clean and nice. When you first open the door you can see the little cafe area where they have coffee and some pastries. They have a nice menu which includes sandwiches, salads and kids meals, too.   There are two bathrooms and they were both well maintained and clean. Kids must wear socks at all times and adults also (if you're gonna be interacting with your kid in the play area). If you don't have socks, you can also rent a pair for $1.   There are some sofas in front of the play area and some tables and chairs for the adults to sit and watch their kids or eat their food. They don't allow food or drinks from outside though.  Overall it's a nice place and we'll be bringing our daughter back. There were lots of kids this past Sunday and apparently they also celebrate birthday parties because there was one Spiderman themed party while we were there too. The staff decorated the tables for the little guests and they brought Barro's pizza. I don't know if the pizza's included on the birthday celebration package or what the deal is but the kids seemed to be having a good time.  Check it out! Your kids can climb and run around for a few hours while you just sit and relax. Not a bad deal at all!!

Today's my coworker's last day and she picked this restaurant for her farewell lunch so I called last Wednesday to book a party of 20 people for today at noon. The girl I spoke to asked for my number and a name for the reservation and ok'd it.  We arrived to The Strand today  at noon and I saw the tables I had specified we wanted were all taken already so right away I realized we had a problem (this is a small restaurant and it's packed during lunch, that's why I called in advance to make sure we got those tables specifically.  We've been there before and we know we won't be able to sit together unless we get those tables.  In fact, every time we go we're a large group and we always get the exact same tables).  These two girls we spoke to today had no idea what I was talking about. I'm talking about a reservation for 20 people! Anyway, it looks like someone dropped the ball big time. I feel bad for the girls we spoke to today because they obviously had no idea and they tried to sit us on different tables but the only reason why I called 48h in advance was to get the 4 tables next to the entrance so we would be sitting somehow together (which I requested specifically).  Sitting on different tables scattered all over the restaurant just makes no sense.   I didn't get the name of the person I spoke to last Wednesday (it was a girl, that's all I can say) but she took my phone number and said the reservation was fine for today at noon. And I just checked their phone number again to make sure I called the right restaurant because the girls we spoke to today kept asking if I was sure I had called The Strand that's Downtown and yes, that's the restaurant I called.  We like their food and the ambiance of this restaurant but we ended up moving the party to The Corner instead (which was upsetting because that wasn't the place our coworker had picked) and they were extremely accommodating, we all sat together and enjoyed a nice lunch and a nice review's on their way now.  I understand this was an honest mistake and the girls we spoke to aren't the ones to blame for this but they may want to get a better system to reserve tables so they don't have another big group of customers bring their business somewhere else.

I love this Chipotle location and I won't eat at any other. I actually have one really close to my house and their rice's usually hard so I just stopped going there. I also tried the one in Buckeye once and they gave me so little food, I had to and buy something else to eat when I was done. I know at some other location on the East side the staff makes you pick between rice OR beans, you can only get ONE salsa, etc. So that's annoying.  But this location's awesome!! We go here once a week. I wait and wait patiently until Friday (I could eat here every single day but that's the only day of the week I eat out and I MUST have Chipotle) and it's the happiest day of the week :)  I usually order online at like 8 am as soon as I get to work, (I'm telling ya, I wait patiently all week for my burrito bowl!) and when I get there at noon my food's ready. Sometimes I gotta wait in line because other customers get there before I do but I usually don't have to wait for my food to be ready (maybe it's because they've had my request for 4h but who cares? I really just wanna eat at that point :))  The manager already knows us and I can talk to him if something's not fine with my order. He actually stops by every Friday to make sure we're happy customers. I mean, how many fast food restaurant managers do this? I don't know any!  Their portions lately have been a little bit smaller than what I'm used to, specially when it comes to the amount of meat they serve so I'll keep an eye on that and talk to him if necessary and I'm also having to order extra rice because, well, it looks like they're serving less too. Or it may be the person that prepares my bowl at the to go window, who knows?  In any case, if you're Downtown Phoenix and you want something yummy and inexpensive to eat, GO TO CHIPOTLE!! Lunch hour's busy every day of the week (specially Monday-Friday) but the food's worth it!  If you can, order online and save yourself a few minutes, they're good about it and when they haven't been, I've told them and they've taken care of me (giving me a free meal or apologizing for the inconvenience and not letting it happen again).  Keep in mind this is a fast food restaurant but their food's still great (reason why their line to order food at lunch time's so long). They also serve meat from naturally raised animals and when they don't have this meat available, they make sure they have sing at the door to let you know (in case this is one of the reasons you go to Chipotle so you don't have to wait for 20 min to order your food and find out THEN that your naturally raised meat isn't gonna be the one you're gonna be eating today) so I think that's pretty cool.  The price for extra guac is excessive in my opinion but that's the way it is everywhere else so no different than subway or any other restaurant here.   Now if I could only find good copy cat recipes to make my own bowls at home... YUM!!

Like every Friday, I went to Chipotle with my coworkers. We love it so much, we order online at 8 am as soon as we get to the office. My burrito bowl's ALWAYS perfect but  today it had beans and I have an extreme aversion to beans so I had to go back and tell them to prepare a different one...   Well, I hadn't even arrived to the to go window when the manager saw me waiting with my burrito bowl on my hands and asked if everything was OK. I explained what happened and gave him the receipt for my online order and he, himself, got in the kitchen and made me a new burrito bowl! This guy rocks! He always takes really good care of me and he stops by our table and asks if everything's ok. No need to do this at a "fast food" restaurant but he delivers and this is why I keep coming every single week.   The food's great and so are the prices but the customer service at this location's outstanding, specially at noon when the restaurant's packed, he still found the time fix me another bowl.  I'm telling you, he rocks!!  See you next Friday!!

Very nice restaurant Downtown.  You can eat at the bar, sit on a table or order to go. Service's usually fast. You wait in line (yes, it's that good, they have lines, specially at lunch time), you pay and then you wait for your food :)  Their food is tasty and their selection's good enough that you can find something you will like for sure. They serve breakfast, soups, pizzas, salads, sandwiches... You can also make your own salad and they'll weigh it and charge you accordingly. Nice selection of drinks (wine, too!) and desserts.   If you want a sandwich with chips and a drink you'll spend like $10-$12. It can be overpriced for some but the ambiance at Chloe's corner's so nice so it's worth it! I usually order the chicken pesto sandwich or the chipotle raspberry turkey. Can you spell YUMMYLICIOUS!! I believe their sandwiches are a little bit smaller than they used to be but that's still OK.  They're great with groups too which is a problem when we want to celebrate a birthday (we work Downtown) and you can call in advance and they'll reserve a table for you. Kudos to their staff. Everybody's super nice!!  They used to have coffee for 50c (yes, that's two quarters!!!) but not anymore :( Their coffee's good but for $1,50 it's not a deal anymore since that's what you pay anywhere else Downtown.   Right now they also sell gelato which, let me tell you, I don't eat much ice cream but their gelato's to die for!   And do me a favor, order a toffee chocolate cookie! I like them so much, I've started baking them at home myself because I can't afford buying one cookie a day, ha! (I probably shouldn't either but their cookies are absolutely delicious!!).

The food's great (the enchiladas are, the cubano sandwich, meh) but the service sucks. They give you a hard time to use coupons or deals you get online even if it's something they offer on yelp or restaurant.com so I have one more certificate from them and I'm going to exchange it for another restaurant because although I absolutely LOVED their enchiladas they were so rude I'm not even going to bother going back and trying to use that certificate.

This place's awesome. Yummy, sweet, delicious donuts. Much better than what you get at any grocery store. Prices are fair and their staff's very friendly. Stop by today and grab a dozen donuts for your coworkers. Trust me, you'll make everyone's day!

We went to West Valley Rv & Marine last Saturday 3-22-14 to pick up a Uhaul cargo van. According to the UHaul website they're an authorized dealer. I explicitly waived the $10 charge for CDW during my online reservation and when we arrived to pick up the cargo van we were told it was a mandatory fee and we had to pay for it. We even spoke to the manager who said it wasn't optional yet, the website gives you the option to waive this charge. Had I known this wasn't optional, I would've gone with a different rental company. We're extremely upset because we believe this is extremely misleading. If I'm given the option to waive this charge online, it should be honored when I pick up the vehicle. I'm never renting from Uhaul again.

Bill H. of West Valley Rv & Marine says on his answer that it wasn't their fault that I'm upset and that they had to charge the fee anyway because they were told to do it.  Them telling me when I get there before they give me the keys for my rental doesn't make this right. I had signed an agreement online, given them my credit card information and I had calculated how much it was going to cost. I specifically waived the insurance online because I was given this option. That means I didn't wanna pay for it so them telling me I had to pay for it at the store is very deceiving. It pretty much means, either you pay the insurance or you don't get the vehicle and if I don't get the vehicle, I can't get my furniture. I understand businesses are struggling these days and everybody wants to make a profit but that's a very disgusting way to make $10.  I suppose you think I could've just canceled my rental right there and then and gone to another company but you have to keep in mind I had already driven there with my husband and my toddler to rent the van and I had already made arrangements to pick up the furniture I had to pick by using this van so the fact that I was told when I got there is actually very deceiving, whether is a $10 fee or a$100 fee,  you can't expect me to re-arrange all of this stuff and go to another company when I had made this arrangement to pick up my furniture weeks ago. It was a 3-4h rental, by the way. I just had to pick up furniture, bring it to my house, bring back the van. Done. Arguing with you at the store, posting a review and answering to your very unprofessional reply is taking longer than picking up my furniture and dropping it off at my house.   Bottom line's Uhaul can't give you the option to waive a fee online and then charge you that fee when you go to the store to pick up your vehicle. That's just not what I agreed online and my agreement should've been honored. That's deceiving and that's why I'm upset about.  Stay away from this store. They're not honest at all.

I've been there several times with my coworkers both for lunch and for happy hour.  Lunch specials are good. I had a rice bowl and it was filling and very yummy. Their sushi's fresh and I like their happy hour too. Good prices definitely attract County employees after 5 pm when we're done for the day.  Everything I've tried is delicious and the staff's extremely nice too. Definitely a good place to chill after work.

I love this place! I love sushi and theirs is fresh and delicious. They have some premade rolls you can take to go (or eat there if you like) or you can order from their menu and they'll make it fresh. I believe their price's fair for the quality of their food and they use purple rice which is healthier than white rice.  The seating area isn't too big but they have a few tables. If you're part of a big group, though, it'll be hard for you to find seating, specially at lunch time.   Service is pretty fast, even at lunch time when they're the busiest and the staff's always nice and courteous.  All in all, it's a very good place to get sushi downtown Phoenix.

Very nice and new urgent care/emergency pediatric center.   Our son had very high fever and it was oit first time there. We've been to Goodnight Pediatrics before but this is a much more comprehensive place. My son needed urine and blood work and they did it all in there. We had results in less than 1h and the whole visit took 2h or less.  The staff's extremely nice and attentive and the doctor and nurses who saw my son were very pleasant and professional, gave us tons of information and answered all of our questions.  We never felt rushed.  I prefer this place to Goodnight Pediatrics because although GNP's has been our first choice before, GNP's a good place if your kod's older than 2 or if they won't need bloodwork or a urine sample. Our son's 5 months old,  though so GNP would've told us to go to a hospital because he's too young and there's nothing they can do (it happened with our daughter). GNP though is opened in the middle of the night while Phoenix Children's closes at 11 so there's pros ans cons to both places.  Phoenix Children's newer and their waiting room's very kid oriented, colorful...   Hopefully you never need their services but if you do, don't hesitate.  They're great!

I love everything about this! I love pizza, you can make your own masterpiece by choosing anything and everything from the crust to the sauce, to the cheese, to all the toppings in the world. They also offer online ordering which makes picking up your food so easy. Just show up and get your pizza box and you're good to go. And their pizza's delicious, really. I hope they open a Pizza Studio on the west side at some point. I can only visit the one Downtown and I'm hooked! So good!!

This place's awesome!   Food's great (you MUST try the steak fries! Absolutely delicious!) and my burger was O.H.S.O. yummy! I can't wait to go back. Portions were good for the price. And our waitress was kind enough to divide our bill among 8 and she even divided the cost of the steak fries we ordered on our bill so we all paid for them without having to figure out how much we each owed for it. That's something I've never seen before. Pretty cool if you ask me.  I don't drink beer so I can't speak much for it but I did try the white chocolate one and it was good (I'd have ordered one had I not been 7 months pregnant, ha!) and they had tons of other options if you don't like funky flavored beer. It's a big place, tons of sitting inside or in the patio area.   Also, they're dog friendly and one day a week you can bring your furry pal along and dine in the patio. They have doggie treats to go if you want to bring one for your doggie on the way out. I don't have a dog but I thought this was a nice touch also.  All in all, I'm not sure when I'll be back because we live far away but if and when we're back in the area, we'll make sure to go back. 5 Stars food and service. Everything was just great!!

Stopped for a quick lunch yesterday and both husband and I thought it wasn't all that great.  We both got a burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo. I've had better meat before. It didn't even taste like asada and it was definitely way too salty. I was thirsty for hours.  There's a salsa bar (we tried a red salsa and a green one. Green one was OK. The red one tasted too much like tomato sauce. Nothing special) but you get no chips with your burrito, you have to pay extra for them.  It was our first time there and most likely we won't go back. There are better Mexican restaurants in town.

I love this place. Cool environment, friendly staff, yummy food and always packed at lunch (hey! That's a good sign!) and they offer reservations through Yelp which is extremely convenient. I love going to The Corner. It's always a nice experience.

Hubbie and I decided to go there because I had a Groupon to try this place.   We love Greek food and we eat it every weekend and this was kind of a dissapointment. First of all the restaurant's set up like a sit down place but it's more like a "sit wherever you want- we'll bring your food to your table when it's ready" place.  No problem. Just confusing.  We go to the counter to order our food and apparently they have some kind of points system where you get a latte after like $40 spent there, you get it. Anyway, the customer who was ordering before us wanted to use this point system and he wasn't being given credit for them. He explained to the staff this is the second time he's had issues with this. They apologized in a very lame way and when he left, they proceeded to make fun of him in front of us. Like seriously? So unprofessional!  If you offer something like this for  regular customers you'd think they want customers to come back right?  Red flag for first time customers like us.  The decor of the place's beautiful,  specially outside during a cold night because you can sit by their big firepit or under a patio heater.  The food... Well it was OK. The Greek fries were greasy, so oily and the gyro pita wasn't memorable. They don't fold it and wrap it like you'd expect and there's so much shredded iceberg lettuce on top you can barely taste the meat.  Overall we wouldn't recommend this place and most likely won't be eating there again simply because of what we saw in terms of customer service when making fun of the previous customer and also because their food's not really Greek food.  If you want Greek food you're better off going to Greek Gyro Express by Sams club in Avondale or to Pita Kitchen in W. McDowell across the Costco plaza.
