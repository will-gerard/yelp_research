Usually I love macaroni grill but this particular location sucks. We waiting a good ten minutes before we were even acknowledged, and it was 3pm, restaurant was near empty. Waited another five minutes to be seated. The bathroom was a mess and smelled awful. I've worked in the restaurant business for years, and I know that even on a really bad day, a restaurant should never be this poorly run.

Been to a lot of hookah places around the valley. Pita House takes the cake on service, friendliness, and their hookah tastes better and last longer than any other place I've been to. I don't really like middle eastern food so I've never ordered if here. But I'm sure it's great!

Tried this place for the first time last night. If you're a "beer guy" this is the place to hit. They brew all their own stuff on location. They've only been open about eight months. The employees are great, super down to earth, very attentive, did I mention their beer is amazing? If you dig IPAs, try their Imperial Adler IPA. 12% and jeezus it's so good. Spread the word peeps!
