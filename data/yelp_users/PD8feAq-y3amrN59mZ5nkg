Being a business owner myself, I have always lived by the mantra that the customer is always right. This is definitely not the case with this business. I have a video production company and my crew of 2 contractors is working today at the KROC's Boy's and Girls Club literally across the street from this place. I'm currently in New York over the holidays so I'm doing my best to provide them lunch the best I can with the resources available to me. And being that I searched for "delivery" on Yelp and this place has a "yes" under delivery, I would assume I could get the food delivered. That wasn't the case today. The person that answered the phone said "No delivery driver today". Like, what? Is there a schedule for when I can get delivery and when I can't? So, whatever, no problem. I said, that's fine, I'll just order the food and have one of my guys come pick it up real quick. I told him the situation and I asked if I could just pay for the food over the phone since I wasn't in the area and I needed to get these guys lunch. He said "No, we don't do that." Ok, so if someone orders delivery from you guys (on the on days for delivery at that), I'm sure they take the credit card over the phone and get it dropped off no problem, as I'm sure the delivery drivers don't walk around with credit card swipers. Long story short, this guy obviously didn't want my business because he was the most un-accomidating POS as I tried endlessly to find a solution without having these guys come out of their pockets to pay for a meal that me as the business owner should be providing them. It's a shame too because we have a contract for the next year where we'll be filming at that location one weekend a month which could have equaled some good business for these people over the year, but, being less than a smart business man, this person didn't see it that way. It's crazy to me too because our business isn't even a consumer based company and I can sit on my couch at my house and take credit card from my clients over my phone like nothing, and these guys act like it's no big deal to turn away clients. If you need some delivery, don't even bother reaching out to Tam's. If you're local and are going to eat at this shop, do me a favor and slap this guy squarely across the top of his head for me. Happy days!

I haven't tried Hawaiian cuisine since I first went to Aloha Kitchen, but I have after, and I must say, this is the best Hawaiian food I have ever tasted. Try one of the combos, I like Mix Plate 3 and 4. They have really good macaroni salad that I usually get with the combo as well.

Wow, for a walk up Mexican place, this place is disgustingly overpriced.. I got a two shrimp taco combo meal, and it ran me 8 bucks and change.. They have a chip and salsa bar THAT THEY CHARGE YOU FOR.. They also charge for refills.. This place really nickle and dimes you.. The food was the tiniest portions ever too.. My shrimp tacos, albeit tasty, were in the really really tiny tortillas, I finished my whole meal in less than 5 minutes.. If you want a similarly good restaurant, go to Sorranos, prices are about the same and it's a sit down place, they also give you unlimited chips, salsa and bean dip

The atmosphere was really nice here.. They had Frank Sinatra playing, leather seated and dim lights.. I went there with my parents, but I would definitely consider this for my next date spot.. The food was really good and the waiter was very professional and curtious.. I would definitely recommend this resteraunt if you're looking for a really nice dinner spot.. The special ran about $32 dollars, which is a little pricy for a pasta dish, but the meal was good.

This is the best Mexican place in town. Prices very reasonable, unlimited chips, bean dip and salsa, and great service. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to try a real deal family style mexican restaurant.

Very good food, I had the Curry Chicken that was very tasty. The fried ragoons and egg role were quite good too. I had enough for two servings.

I called Macias Landscaping because I got a letter from the town of Tempe saying they were going to fine me because of my palm trees being overgrown. They were able to come out the day after I called them and was even able to come particularly early because of my work schedule. The palm trees look great and I really appreciated the quick response and fast service. I would definitely recommend Macias to anyone needing their palms trimmed.
