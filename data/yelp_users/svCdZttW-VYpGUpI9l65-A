This Wendy's was recently remodeled. Its very nice, clean, and a lot fancier than a normal one. It has a cool looking gas fireplace, and TV. Some nice wood paneling and glass fixtures. They also have the computerized drink station, which i love, because it has sparkling water for us that don't really like to drink soda. They have a nice living room style seating are with big leather lounge chairs. The staff is friendly and takes your order by name. I come here for a quick lunch every now and then. When i don't feel like cooking, and have limited funds. Great place for a fast food restaurant. Just a little bit above the rest.

I've lived in the neighborhood for a few years now and hadn't tried this place until recently. I needed an emergency pizza, and it is in walking distance for me. The pizza was really good, so my girlfriend and I decided to go there and try it out. It's a nice place, and they had the football game on, so I'm already liking. Then I find out they have Santan Sunspot Gold! Hello! Really? You had me at Sunspot! You mean I can walk 5 minutes and enjoy a Sunspot? OMG! If they can fill growlers I'll really flip out!  Ok, on to the food, did the pizza muffins, since I ate like 5, I'll say good! She got the 3 cheese ravioli and I got the antipasto salad. They were both superb. We got the brownie dessert, and went home and lapsed into food comas. My only small complaint was that the lighting seemed a bit bright, but the service was really good and prompt. The waiter knew the menu and was very personable. The gf is already asking when we can go back. So it's a winner. I also run into friends here and see a lot of them checking in. This will definitely be a new regular haunt.

I was kind of war driving with Yelp and found this little place. It had the best rating in the plaza it was in. I was almost gonna get taco bell and call it a night, but I was compelled to try this place.  The gentleman who was working the counter, I think from the other reviews I saw was the owner. He was a nice man and a little humorous. The people there seemed to know him and knew this place well, I ordered the house chicken combo and a miso soup, I got it to go since I was camping out at home that night. I gotta say, I'm not a big rice bowl fan, but this place was great. The soup was good, and chicken was really good. chunky, lots of mushrooms and flavor, and just enough spice. I devoured it all. I usually don't eat all the rice, but it mixed well with the chicken. Even the egg roll was really good and crunchy despite me stopping at the store on the way home. I would definitely eat here again.

I don't know where to start about these guys except to say Chase Bank = worst bank ever. I had no choice become a customer of these crooks because they bought my home loan from another company. I had no say in the matter. If I had a choice, Chase bank would be my very last choice. I feel much more like a victim of this horrible company than a customer. Their app is terrible and doesn't work right, so they reward themselves for it handsomely with a healthy late fee for themselves. Now, they make me pay my mortgage with a cashier check or cash only, because when they went to "reward" themselves with some of my hard earned money for their gross incompetence, my bank USAA, best bank in the world, denied them. I can't express how much I hate dealing with these guys, and they stand by their lack of empathy and poor customer service. They truly don't care, they make their money off of late fees and tricky practices. If you're thinking of banking with Chase, just don't, they truly suck. You'll wish you didn't. There's a Desert Schools credit union across the street, and they are a much better choice, I have them also, and they are great.

Having moved out to Chandler from Phoenix, I was pretty spoiled on good Mexican food there, so I had to find some places out here. This place is pretty decent. It looks very Mexican with the bright yellow building. You can't miss it. They have a bar area which is usually not in use during the daytime. I've eaten here 3 times so far. the first time I got take out. I always get the number 1, 3 carne asado taco plate. the second time the rice was overcooked and the beans tasted old, but the next time they were good. the tacos are always good, they put some special bbq sauce on the tacos as the owner pointed out to me. I do wish they had self serve fountain drinks, but other than that, as long as I can get some good tacos, I'm cool. Like this place.

This is my Cheers, my neighborhood bar. Owned and operated by friends, this is my go to place when i want a bite and a few really good beers, and don't want to wander far from home. The ever changing craft beer menu is incredible and what caused places like Applebee's to vacate Chandler altogether. They just couldn't compete. The menu, in part originally created by my long time good friend and beer expert King James Swann, is a bit like my old hangout in Phoenix where he also worked, Hazelwoods 1st place. (They were known for their wings ;).       Upon permanently relocating to Chandler, the proximity to the Monk was actually part of my house buying decision. I have to have a good neighborhood bar close by. Its a must. I need wings! The owner Jim is a cool guy, the bartenders are all awesome and like friends. I love the regulars too. People often underestimate the importance of a good bartender/libation therapist. Plus theres like 57 TVs to watch sports on. Go Monk!

I had the Beef Stew with noodles. It was very tasty.  The noodles were fresh and yummy, and the beef chunks and broth were very mouthwatering.  I also tried the beef buns. They were delicious, The pastry was freshly made and very meaty inside. I dipped then in the stew. I was full and satisfied.        The server was very nice and helped me order since I was not familiar with this cuisine. Her picks were very good. I want to go back since there are many things on the menu I would still like to try. The place is not fancy and it's not the dark romantic atmosphere I normally like, but the food makes up for all that, and it's affordable. I highly recommend it! Another great Yelp find for me! Score!

I checked this place out tonight, since I just moved in the neighborhood, I'm still sampling out the local fare. I know this place got some unfavorable reviews in the past by other Yelpers, but honestly, I didn't think it was that bad for what it is. It's a casual dining experience. Since I'm on a budget these days, I can't afford the high end sushi places that exist around town. This eatery is definitely do-able for an after work place for me, and it's very close to home.  Maybe it's not super-duper fancy,  but It is brand new and  very clean.        Although they are still waiting for their liquor license to clear, it's not the end of the world, We all know you can't really have a great sushi experience without a nice cold Kirin or Sopporo and sake. But they should have theirs by August.   They have a bar and TV's already to go for when that happens. I talked to a manager and she told me it is owned by the same owners of China King, which is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. I will definitely be checking back to see how they do. If the China King people own it, I'm sure it will only get better, because CK is absolutely amazing.  This place, and others like it, is kind of like a sushi express, when you need a quick bite that's not too expensive. The portions are smaller than normal places, but so are the prices. It's proportional.  You have plates that are $1, $1.50, $2, $2.50, and $3. Plus if you want something that's not on the go-round, they'll make it for you. The food was good and fresh. The staff was attentive and friendly. When you're talking sushi go rounds, I don't think they were meant to be palaces. Just clean, convenient and inexpensive, and not fast food like.       I think it might be helpful, if you are a Yelper doing reviews, and you don't like a place, to maybe talk to your server or manager and ask some questions about it. Then, if you experience rudeness or indifference, then by all means an unfavorable review is in order.  If not, then maybe (and this is important) provide some feedback! then give them another chance down the road to see if things improve. Believe it or not, they will listen to you. They do see these reviews and are certainly affected by them. This place has only been open a week, so they have a lot of tweaking to do, and they are quite aware of that.
