This place is mediocre at best. Pizza is only good hot and loses its consistency as it gets cooler.  Wings are your normal franks red hot and lucky if the big ones are cooked all the way. I'd say look elsewhere even though they have friendly prices for the cheap.

This place is disgusting. From the food to the place I would not recommend this to anyone. Except for my enemies.

Nice rooms but they don't have room service. And you better be a premiere card carrier or they'll boot you out by 11am. Great place for a staycation in the summer rates as low as $60 four a 3/4 star hotel.

Great prices...awesome food. Captain Bills is an establishment and have been doing business right since day one. Love to give them my business and love their food. Keep us the good work and great place for lunch.

Hands down best mexican restaurant in town! Great atmosphere and amazing food. Service could be better but what restaurants service is good? Relatively cheap. Last time there was 5 of us with multiple drinks with our meals and it only came out to $120. I'd recommend taking outbid towners here or a date.

Thee best za in town. Hands down!  Love to go here and sober up after a night of debauchery on mill. A little pricey for a large but it's worth every dime. The shop on mill is the only one to go to. The rest let their pizza sit all day why mill slices is always pumping them out. Only bad thing about this slices, is the cocky college students always trying to fight you when your in line.  Go at your own risk from 12-2am. Other than that it's awesome.

Best Sicilian za in town! Great place to take a date. But I recommend the one on Glendale (they serve alcohol there).

Cheap drinks, clean bar and great hole in the wall atmosphere. Want a low key night where you can drink and talk it away...this is your place. Not loud, rowdy or crowded. And Roxy the bartender is sweet and fun. Ask her for her taco's and chimichangas. She always cooks it up free of charge to make sure her drunks are taken care of.

Dirtiest club in Phoenix. Your guaranteed to get in a fight or have your girlfriend raped here. VIP is a joke and so it the bottle service.

This place is amazing! I wish every grocery store was like this Fry's. Fruits and vegetables I've never heard or seen before. Love the deli area and all the wonderful meats. Huge alcohol/cigar selection. Can't go wrong when shopping here. And first grocery store I've seen with valet.

The food here is disgusting. No offense to the owner but the wings are bland and the pizza tastes like cardboard.  If you do eat from here just eat it while it's hot. Cold might change the consistency in the food and make it even worse.

Love the seafood fondue. Shit is straight up amazing.  I only take advantage of happy hours here. Service is poor but what do you expect from servers who never get tipped by the lower class.  Great atmosphere, kick ass patio during the winter months and pricey.

This place is disgusting. Too many married or just plain old single men hovering around the mechanical bull with their cameras in hopes they'll see a women's tits flop out or land on their lap. Overpriced drinks, creepy artificial bartenders and too many old perverted men who haven't been laid in some time or hope to cheat on their wifey and kids.

Holy baby Jesus...this za is dank as hell. Idk if you should put Jesus and hell in the same sentence but my brain is overloaded with glee from the delicious pizza that is Best of Italy. Good job and see you again soon!

Love the lodge. Whenever my lady friends want to stray to American junkie I direct them to the lodge.  I'm not up for a 2 hour line while they drink so it's always the lodge to pull the night out. Nothing special, just a good environment.

Love Fogo De Chao! Go here every 6 months to stuff my face with the best meats on the planet. Big alcohol selection if you can afford it and the cheese/salad buffet is a nice side compliment to the meat. This is a place to take your wifey or sister visiting in town. 6 stars if I could!

Not a fan of junkie at all. Love how the women have a 1 minute fast track line to the 2 hours guy line.  Best part is the bouncers trying to exude their authority of standing in line. You work there because of your muscle...not your brains. Shut up and do your job like a professional. This is the epitome of 30k millionaires wanting to hang around athletes and people in the upper class. If you me this is trash and no W.

They used to sell cigarettes here for cheap. Now they're not any cheaper than going to a non reservation gas station. Head up to chaparral or via de ventura for cheap smokes

Talk about overrated. Open a club anywhere in old town and it's a hit no matter what. This place is too fake and cheesy for my likings. And the average age is 37.

Why is it that Oregano's always has small buildings with little elbow room? This isn't Italy. This Oregano's blows compared to the Tempe/Scottsdale one and they're not that much better. Poor service, food is a little off and the building is too damn small.  Might as well go to Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo and have an enjoyable lunch/dinner. Plus they're overpriced due to the valley's sick obsession with Oregano's.

Finally a Chipotle near me! Love this place. Fast good service and delicious tacos are here. I prefer the Barbocoa burrito. You can't go wrong here.

This use to be my neighborhood drink spot  then they went out of business and Tilted Kilt moved in. They did zero renovating and looks nothing like the other ones. The atmosphere is awkward and you feel as if you should be in a classy latin bar that existed there before. The food sucks and the girls are beat. They should step it up to hooters if they don't care about morals or clothing. This was created for the fathers of Paradise Valley/Scottsdale to get away from their wives and family and stare at young woman's tits and ass. Tilted Kilt PV=Fail.
