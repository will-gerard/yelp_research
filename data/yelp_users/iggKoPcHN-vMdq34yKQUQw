Great food and well priced - the owner is very nice and remembers you from visit to visit. Strange decor but I guess it was a formerly a 50s dinner.

I drive to Bell rd Toyota even though this dealer is by my house...enough said . They are typical pushy follow you around the lot sales people.

yum - I like the yogurt and the location a lot. Lots of parking if your not there at the lunch rush as there are tons of restaurants around it.

I am writing this based on my conversation with Chris whom answered the phone when I called. When I got gas yesterday my cc was charged for the $38.02 I got in gas & then again $1.00....I was kinda worried why a second charge had shown up & wondered why...I called Chris answered and was very nice & explained why gas stations often times will show a second charge like that as a pre-authorization fee & that the fee will go away in a couple of days. He was very nice - tks Chris.
