Lots of fun... me and my girlfriend want to go there again and again.  The first time we went we came to late and Morgan (an extremely friendly fun staff member) gave us a quick idea of what to expect.  She gave us recommended times, reminded us about the fun, and kept us smiling.   We returned a week later and had an absolute blast.  Though I will say my talent is sub - par and my girlfriend is an artist in secret.   We should have our painted mugs soon!    Thank you Morgan for a great experience, and too all the staff who helped encourage us to do our best and have fun!

Weekend staff are nice and friendly.  I come here every Saturday and the experience never changes or gets better.  Come early for fast seating.  Late morning equals big wait. Great food

This is my favorite restaurant in the whole world.  The owner Tom is truly a great friend of me and my family.  We have been going there since they opened in 1998.   The food is great and the prices are very affordable, especially for the amount of food you receive.  This one place where the odds slim that you will ever reach the half way point of your glass before they refill it.    I've have taken loads of friends and colleagues here and have yet to hear a bad comment.  I notice during the lunch hours that Golden Valley is a hit for folks who are taking lunch breaks with their co-workers.  I have also seen plenty of families gather to celebrate a special occasions.  This a simply a wonderful family oriented restaurant with a good personality and warm atmosphere.  And we all lived happily ever after..... THE END! :-) ha ha

I have gone here so many time that the folks know me by name and by order.  I am officially 'Mr. Iced Green Tea'.  Well not really, though there are always smiles on the staffs' faces and an willingness to offer suggestions and make things to order.  The WiFi is also strong for those with laptops looking for a good place to work.   Prices are good as any Coffee Bean and for a 32oz iced tea, $3.00 is perfect, especially when I don't have to order it.  See you there!

I am the DUKE of Cliam Jumper.  And I am claiming that this location is offically closed.  For reason I am unaware of.  Our dear server and staff friends who are always friendly have been relocated, thank goodness.    If the service was great at this location then I expect nothing less from other locations.

The Absolute Burrito!  No other burrito company like it and they just started offering brown rice.  I'm officially a life long customer.  Wow, I actually said that!

The experience was absolutely delightful. Our server Keith made us feel welcome and appreciated.  This is so uncommon from most restaurants.  I'm pretty sure the ladies at the table were blushing from his kindness.  The food was made to perfection.  I can't believe we had dessert too.. If you go for dinner ask for Keith.  You won't be disappointed.

I meet here for the Lion's Club every other week.  The staff is always friendly and location for folks traveling is perfect as it borders the I-10 and is within good distance from good hiking trails, shopping centers, and restaurants.

Good craft beer and good heavy pizza.  Friendly service.  Got stuffed with a smile!  Ordered the Triathlon pizza, boneless wings, sweet potato fries, McGarvey's Scottish Ale, and some sodas.

The ambiance says it. A cabin country feeling that is both clean and welcoming. Servers are always very friendly on Saturday mornings (when I visit the diner). The food portions our outrageous in size, especially the homemade biscuits.  The kids will love this place and couples will feel like they took a mini-trip.  Can accommodate low carb Had small portion options Has vegetarian options Not sure about gluten free options

EXTRA BLACK COFFEE!!!   That's All..  Great DD!  The staff are super friendly and always get my order correct.  I typically arrive as many do during the rush period so the fact that my order yet to be messed up shows excellent service.  Yes, I do order more than black coffee here and there.

I've been here three Sunday's in a row now!  I don't know what it is about the Thai Food here!  Wait I know.. The Food is Great!  I am a curry person so my focus here are curry dishes.  They have this Pumpkin Curry dish that is super cool!    For my Spicy Friends - Yes, they can make it very spicy but you need to ask for it.  Typically the server will ask how hot you want it.  For me just a little hotter that Thai Hot is perfect.  For my Mom, totally mild and they are to make it mild.  If you haven't had Thai Food then go Here, First!  Order a Thai Iced Tea get the Pad Thai dish (if you like noodles) and just Enjoy!

Food is good. Staff is friendly.  Simply a good medium sized diner. It doesnt have a big patron following and can get busy and noisy. That's just shows how well the place is doing.

Wow I'm full. Thanksgiving flavors for breakfasting. What is this? It's good. Matter a fact so good it was taken off the menu because of so many orders. That's the turkey and sweet potato hash. I recommend it.    Words to the wise. Come early. This place gets packed. If you order toast with spread make sure to get double spread comes a little on the light side.  Friendly service is always welcome too.

Joy would sum it up.  Beautiful butterflies flying all around. Come for experience rather an expectation.  Four stars because it was fun, interesting, and unique.   Children love seeing the butterflies, photographers enjoy the easy access to great photo shots, most importantly this was a great place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.

Tried the nachos, sweet potato tots, and complimentary corn bread. YUM!! Service was pretty good as well.  Over all very tasty.  Agree with eye candy comment. Ha ha.

Soda machines weren't working. No ice. Hardly any carbonation. The crew wouldn't own up and tell us there was a problem. They just said wait a bit and the issue will resolve itself. We saw many customers bring the issue up only to get the same feedback from the crew. Bummer because the food was decent and staff friendly enough to an extent.

Like an earlier review I am also a frequent patron. I can honeslty say this place is falling apart not just in service quality but also physically. The patio umbrellas are completely broke.  The floors are not kept and I told my group to please wipe there shoes on the pavement before entering my truck.  The food quality was good but not great as it use to be.  I am worried this place may not make it even though it has a huge following.
