Love the PHX Zoo!! All the animals were out and about and looked good. The weather was cooler in Oct. Staff was friendly. Kudos to @phoenixzoo on Twitter for getting us out and reminding us to go!

Never been to a place like this before, but I am a fan of Cuban food now!  I had the paradise pork (see pictures) It was a little sweeter than I had expected, but really good.  Beans and rice were spicy, but really tasty.  I also highly recommend the fried bananas!!  I could eat a whole plate of those things ... my only suggestion would be to put chocolate sauce all over them hahaha!!!    Can't wait to go back and try more.  The service was really good and friendly.   A must try if you are in the area.

First of all, we went at about 2:00 and the place was dead, but we were asked to wait 15 min (which turned out to be closer to 25)  Seriously, there was NO ONE in the place.  Finally we got sat down and the service was good (which is the only reason they are getting a  2 star review)  Getting sat down revealed what I just said too - there was hardly ANYONE in the whole place, yet I still had to wait almost 25 min.  shhheeesh!!!  My food was burnt, and there was not much sauce and it did not taste fresh like the other one I just ate at a few days ago.    In all fairness my wife had the chicken cannelloni and said hers was about a "4" and I tasted it and hers was better then mine, but still I was not impressed with the wait or MY food.  I probably will not be back to this location ... ever again.  I will stick to the downtown Scottsdale location ... they seem to have it more together there!

Five stars for the memory. (hope you all enjoy it) When I was a kid we went here as a family all the time, but one time when I was a baby the organ came out and started playing and I almost bit my moms boob (other parts but keeping this pg for the kids) right off. No matter how many times we go back, nothing will ever get my family to stop telling that story. Lol.  Pizza is decent, and service has always been ok, although I haven't been there in quite some time!

If you own a car that is older and you want it to look and smell new - this is the place.  Our 3 year old truck looks brand spanking new after these guys got done with it.  We also had them tint it and it turned out amazing ... again ... I say again because this is the second vehicle I have taken to them.  That is the main reason I went back - I could not believe how good both my vehicles turned out.  I had the window tint on the other one for about 3 years before I sold it and still to the day I sold it ... the tint was perfect.  They use only the top quality film, and do quality work.  I will keep going back and sing their praises all day long!  If you are looking for a detail job, or window tint, this is the ONLY place you should be looking!  Check out some pictures I took of my vehicles after they got done..

4 stars because they don't take credit cards. Really? In this day and age?  Yogurt and shakes were good, but not the best I've ever had, but a solid 4 stars.

They are getting a 4 star because of great service.  That is not to say that their food was bad, it was a solid 3 star, but normal what you would expect from a old fashion diner like this.  I had sliders, they also served breakfast all day which looked good.  Everyone was happy, but the stand out tonight was the service of this place.  They take care of everything and really are helpful.

I have not been to an On The Border forever now.  We were in the area getting some work done to the Lexus so we decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  The salsa is fresh and the service was great.  It was surprising that during lunch it was not busy at all.... sign of the economy times?  who knows, but I enjoyed it ...  I had the steak and enchiladas with rice and beans and my wife had a salad.  We both enjoyed.  Still not worthy of 5 stars, but I will go back and try other things.  It is one of the better Mexican food joints I have tried in a while.  Good and fresh ... thats the main thing right there.

Shame on me for going to a chain Italian joint, but we were in the area and soup salad and breadsticks sounded good.  I have not been to an Olive Garden for maybe 7 or so years, and WOW have they gone downhill.    Food is ok, not good.   Service was poor at best.  Waited for drinks, waited for food, waited for check much much longer than we should have.    Learned my lesson and will not be going back (to this location anyway.)

It does not get better then this as far as Mexican food is concerned.  I love the tacos here more then anything.  Anything on the menu is amazing, but the sampler plate is the most amazing out of all they offer.  You get the best of everything!  Friendly and fun place to take the whole family for some amazing Mexican food!

I like this one the best out of all of them. My first ever Serrano's where I fell in love with the bean dip thing they serve.  The service here is great, and they are way friendly and I would highly recommend this one to anyone!  I like the Machaca chimi more then any other food they serve!!!

Love this place. I mean it is Buffett but you get exactly what you pay for. There is a ton of old peeps that eat there too. It really is one of the best buffett I have ever had (this style). Kids love it and there is a selection for even the pickiest of kids.

Great place with amazing steak. Kids beg is to go here and service is always good. I hate the wait though. This is the main gripe I have with outback because they usually have more then enough tables to seat you in.

Agree wit previous review. This place needs a minus star. We went in and waited about an hour before we got our food. By the the kids were done so we asked them to box it instead which took another 1/2 hour. This place is worthless. I can't even remember if the food was good because I was so angry at the service!!

All I had was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and hands down it was the best pizza I have ever had in the Phoenix area.   The crust was light and just flat out tasted amazing.  I wish it was closer to me in Queen Creek.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  The whole group loved their pizza too.  Agreed it was some of the best they have had in the area.

Jam packed well after lunch hours. Full of mostly locals - Hawaiian locals that is. (That right there should tell you something.) I have not had island food this good since I left the islands.  I am serious - there is a place in Orem Utah called Matiki's and it was #1 on my list until this place.  SOOOOO freaking glad I found this place.  it will be the ONLY Hawaiian joint I hit up from now on!

One of the best places to eat Mexican food in the area.  Really do enjoy this place, but beware ... it's hot ... well at least for this white boy.   My favorite are the combo plates.  Every time I go I try to get something different just to see, but one of my favorites is the stuffed Relleno .... but pretty much anything I have had here is amazing.  I also like how you get lots of different salsa's, bean dips etc with the chips.  These guys do it right!

Loved it. I had no idea this place was even here. This is one of my new favs now. I had the sloppy Joe (I know) but it was huge, sloppy and amazing.    The man himself "Chuck Reynolds" and I ate here (he introduced me to it) and he had an egg salad sandwich that looked amazing too. I wanna go back and try everything on the menu ... It looked that good. AND they have coke zero. Business that have coke zero - automatic 5 stars. LOL

Had to post another review because this time we took the in-laws - My Mother-in-law made the comment that we MUST come back to this place so she can try more.  If that is not a raving review ... I don't know what is??  Hamburger, Pasta, Pizza, Sandwiches ... all the sides.  EVERYTHING was great.    Good, friendly service doing their best to make you happy - even with HUGE numbers of people - you get good, fast service and they have a system that gets you in & sitting painlessly.  Go. Enjoy. Repeat.

This place is literally a shack and hole in the wall place, but it has the BEST red and green chile burritos in all of QC. They are huge. One will do you although you will want to eat more. Go there today!

Got right in, and this place is not what I thought it was at all.  We thought it was just mainly a bar, but its more like an old Dennys or something.  Very cool stuff on the wall, got the Queen Creek Cowboy feel for sure.  The food is great, and the service is pretty good.  They serve breakfast all day, so you can't go wrong with that.  I will be going back to try more for sure.

Down two stars this time.   Here's why:   First, my son spilt some drink and the waitress came to mop it up and was slinging the dirty mop all over my foot and leg.  Very gross.  Second, Food:  The food is just not as good as it was with the previous owners.  The menu is not as good either.  Really don't want to waste a whole lot of time detailing it out, but I just wanted to add I will probably never be back.

Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.

The farm is awesome but if we are rating the food I would have given one star. I forget what they call their cafe but it really is not that great.   The farm itself is fun though.  There is always something going on.  Fall time it is the best - our kids have a blast on all the little rides, and the food they cook from the farm (pulled pork) not the cafe is really good.  It is a little pricey but I suppose they got to off set costs.

My only tip to them would be to use real guac, not that creamy taco bell crap like they gave me on today. If they would have - 5 stars cause my machaca chimi was dang good.  I enjoyed the machaca more then then anywhere else in the area.  I would suggest hitting this place up if you are in the mood for Mexican Food, and NOT Serranos .... My wife said her plate was 3 stars, but would come back and try more.  based on mine alone .... I will be back!

Tacos and enchilada today. Good flavor & fresh salsa. Fast service and very friendly staff today (even though they were understaffed). You will enjoy Rudys lf you have never been.  Authentic AZ mexican food.

I am doing my best to not eat a lot of sugar anymore, but I had a bite of my daughters cookies & cream ice cream and I must say it is the best cookies and cream ice cream I have ever had.    This place is family owned and operated and everything is homemade.  Very good selection.  My son had a shake and drank it up, while another son had the bubblegum ice cream ... he devoured it.    All the kids said it was the best ice cream they have ever had (they say that anytime I take them anywhere though) but I had to do a review and add my .02 because I did try it .. .and it was amazing and its a little hole in the wall you would never know.    On Yelp and when you drive by its just a place where you think you get water and ice.  Luckily they have started putting out signs directing people.  They are close to "The Deli" the diamond eatery in Queen Creek, so I think they should piggy back off their success and do whatever they can to be more visible on Yelp or other location based social networks.  More people need to know about this place and that is why I am writing this review - I am doing my part!  Now enjoy Queen Creek!!

This review is for the brand new building they just opened up across from the old one that was much smaller and only did take out. (I think)  So HAPPY I found this place.  This is my new place for Mexican Food in Queen Creek.  This food had such amazing flavor.  The sauce was amazing and the tacos were seasoned perfectly.  We had good service, there was a ton of people there - all who were raving about the place.  Anyway - if you are looking for great Mexican Food in Queen Creek you need to hit this place up TODAY!!!  Again so glad I found it ... Enjoy and let me know if you liked it as much as I did!

Only 4 stars because there was lots of stuff broke in the rooms (for a triple diamond hotel and the price paid they need to get that fixed).  I say "rooms" too because several people staying told me the same thing.  Overall amazing experience though.  Great staff, great conference area, great food and desserts.  I really enjoyed the grounds too - it is hard to find a more amazing view.  just flat out enjoyed my time here for the SMX Social Media conference.

This place seriously is the best Mexican food in Arizona (of all the places I have tried)  I have been hearing about this place from my Father in Law, ranting and raving about it.  He was not wrong.  Huge portions and amazing fresh flavor.  I could have drank the salsa it was so good.  It was such good salsa I had them box up the left over salsa so I could take home and finish!!  hahah  I can't wait to go back and try more.  I had the taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans.  AMAZING.  Seriously can't wait to go back and try more.  Also was glad to hear they have a place in Mesa too (that's just a wee bit closer)  Check out the picture of my plate.  If that doesn't make your mouth water - you need to get checked out!  Go try this place - even if its a little bit of a drive.

Highly recommend anyone that is going through Wickenburg to give this place a try.  It is only open from 5 am - 2pm (breakfast & lunch) but holy cow it's good.  I had the 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy and YES it was enough for even me.  I don't know who in the hell would be able to eat a full order.  The gravy sauce is magical and addicting.  My wife loved the french toast too.  Again, if you find yourself anywhere near this place GO GO GO!!!

Went for lunch and got right in!  The service was amazing and very friendly.  I had the ceasar salad (which was THE BEST ceasar salad I have ever had in my life)  Also ordered the chicken parmesan (lunch portion - not the normal HUGE one) and it was still almost more then I could eat.  It really was probably in my top 3 of the best chicken parmesan I have ever ate in my life.  I am a sucker for it!  We sat there for about 2 hours talking (was kind of a business meeting) and they kept refilling us, and it was pleasant.  I love this location (besides the construction going on around downtown Scottsdale!

Ahhhhhh-mazing.  Took my wife here for her first time ever at a Ruths...she said it was the best steak she ever had in her life!  As always mine was so good words can't describe.  They even hooked us up with Free banana pie for our anniversary .... they had anniversary confetti and everything.  We felt like a king and queen ... Cant wait to go back!  I had the filet and my wife had the bone in rib eye .... and WOW I think I have a new favorite over there!  If you have never been to a Ruth Chris ... go ... it will be the ONLY time in your life you spend so much on a steak, but don't even care!!  I promise!!

Great burger, not the best I have ever had, but good. Great service. Good atmosphere.  I had the fries too, and they were steak fries style and nom nom.  They have a huge variety of food to try, and the people I went with had the pasta salad and various sandwiches .... I will go back to this place if I find myself in the area, or if I need another business meeting out in that area of the woods...

Ok, but not as good as San Tan Marketplace one. I had the "poncho villa" and it's basically a red chili burro. Was a little to bitter for me, but wife loved it.  Next time I'll stick with tacos & enchiladas.

I really can't think of another hotel where I experienced better service.  I have stayed at so many fancy hotels over the years for business too.  I really really was impressed with every member of the staff that I dealt with.  I love that the valet parking is free.  Nothing worse that spending hundreds of dollars on a hotel room and having to pay 30-50 just to park per night.  Not the case here ... I mean you do have to tip, but still - that's nothing compared to 30 or 50 bucks for parking.    So many freebies and comforts ...   Tower room was amazing, you get a red card with it and it gets you access to private pools, no waiting in line and a ton of other stuff.  I loved it.  I will go back to the Wynn again without a doubt.  Other than losing a 100 dollar bill on the floor (accidentally) and not because of gambling .... I have no bad memories of this place.

Hands down the best place I have eaten in all of Vegas so far on any of my trips.  This time I had the filet, but also had the sampler plate that has a mix of everything.  Their sushi is good, short ribs, potstickers, desserts ... etc EVERYTHING I have had here is AMAZING.  Do yourself a favor and go there and start picking any and everything off the menu ... I will be back to this place every time I visit Vegas.

Simply too much money for what they offer.  The rooms are old and outdated (at least our wing was) Old CRT TVs, old toilets, tubs with problems and generally a lack of anything being nice and new.  (Again, for the money with what you can get elsewhere in Vegas) I didn't know it was so crappy like this at MGM so make sure you know and investigate before.  One positive is the bed was nice and comfy, but again, just too much money for what you get.  I will be staying elsewhere next year.

These guys messed everything up during a recent trip. Reservations, arriving and leaving dates etc.  The people out front were horrible in attitude and plain rude.  I will never stay at TI again when I go to Pubcon - from now on ... its all about the Wynn ..... nuff said - don't want to get my blood boiling again - oh yea and they charged me for Internet THAT I DIDN'T USE!!!!!  Still haven't reversed the charges...... (like a pirate - no pun intended -- GRRRRRRRRR)

Solid 4 stars.  Huge portions - I had the eggs benedict both times I ate here.  Just too good to pass up.  Not the best I have ever had (thus the 4 stars) but this place is solid for breakfast lovers.  The French Toast plate looked amazing and more food than anyone I went with could eat.  This is a 5 or 6 am place to hit after you have been drinking all night and still have not made it to bed just yet.

Only giving this place 2 stars because of the friendliness of staff and my steak was rubbery .... seriously ... I paid almost 40 bucks for a steak I had to chew and chew and chew some more....If we didn't have such poor service (hardly checked on us) I would have sent it back  - the steak is supposed to melt in your mouth.  They also give a plate full of fries along with the steak and I think I have had better fries at a fast food joint ... sad I know because I paid over 100 bucks for two people .... lesson learned and never again.  Stay away from French Food.

I'm confused, but amazed at the same time. I loved it, and hated it at the same time too. I am conflicted.   The people were amazing. I can't believe they did some of the things they did. True athletes.   The problem: I was lost like I didn't know if I should be getting something or if I was missing it. To many buff men getting to friendly with other buffed men scared me a bit. Some of the costumes were also hard to look at.   In all seriousness. It was awesome and am very glad I got to see a Cirque show in Vegas. Next time, the Beatles.  This overall was a dissapointment and waste of money (see the confliction) ..... thus, one star and I can't recommend it to anyone and would never go to it again myself.

Good food and service again.  I just love everything at Famous Daves.   I enjoyed it with my brother in law, wife and brother and they all said their food was fantastic as well.  Beef - nice smokey flavor but not to powerful, and the pulled pork was just amazing and juicy .... This location seems to have things down pat and I would recommend anyone go here.  Why no 5 stars still?  IMO its just not as good as some other BBQ places that are 5 star worthy, but don't let that stop ya from going to Daves...its amazing.

First of all, they have these little potato hash brown things ... GO FILL YOUR PLATE WITH THEM ..... ok, now that I got that off my chest ... I heard from a lot of people that this buffet was the best of LV ... it lived up to the hype for me.  Breakfast and Lunch was amazing ... I never tried the dinner, but what I had was amazing.  Eggs benedict was fantastic (and not hot) even though it says its made with a jalapeno sauce ... great service, great food ... way too much.  They had so much stuff that I wanted to try but just could not fit anymore in my belly.  I can't wait to go back to this place, even if I am not staying at the Wynn...

There is no other Italian place (in my opinion) in Las Vegas.  I have been coming here for years every time I come to Vegas.  The only way to do it is family style - you get so much food, and they take such good care of you.  The only problem I have is I eat to much - every time I go and the rest of the night is miserable ... I never learn!! hahah

Amazing chicken BBQ sandwich. It was probably the best sandwich I have ever ate - seriously, look at the picture.  You will want to go to Vegas and get one right now....  They would have got 5 stars but we went down one afternoon/evening and they said they closed cause it was slow. FML on a Friday?? In Vegas???  That was a bummer.  My wife had a steak salad thing, which she said she enjoyed, and my good friend and his wife had the same as my wife and I and enjoyed their food too.  I had a virgin pina colada and it was yummy too.  I really wanted to go back and try other things, and spend more money with them, but hey ... I guess they need to STAY OPEN for that to happen!!! hahahaah

The most amazing tri tip and baby back ribs. The chicken is pretty dang good too (fall off the bone).  This is the first Lucilles I ever ate at, and is 100% better then the one in Tempe (sadly)   Every time I go to Vegas, I make sure and drive out to Green Valley to hit this place up.  They did not let me down this trip either.  The service was better then ever, and they went above and beyond to make us happy!  I can't wait to go back to this location again!

5 stars cause this place has stuff for guys to do (cafeteria) and places to sit while our wives shop!! Trust me in this store - the women folk can get lost for HOURS and good luck finding them!  I guess the furniture is cool too (very cheap - in an in-expensive sort of way). I want the closets they have.  Time for a closet makeover I guess.  We went looking for bunk beds and I think we found the one we are going to get!

So much food for so little money, and they have kids meals that the kids will actually eat.  If you do not like what they offer in the cafeteria you can get food downstairs like Pizza and hotdogs...what kid does not like Pizza or a hotdog?  I had the meatballs and mashed potatoes and they were so good.  I wish there was something bad to say about eating in a furniture store cafeteria, but there really is not - it was great food, great service and fun for the kids (there is a play area with a TV that they can eat at too (so the parents can enjoy their food too)  My wife had the herb chicken and it looked great too, and she said it was really tasty too.  She loved it.  The desserts were amazing too, and very filling --- SO MUCH FOOD for SO LITTLE THE MONEY!  I wish it was not so far away from Queen Creek, or I would hit it up so much more often!

What a neat little place.  We went around lunch time, but they serve the breakfast until 5 - I was a little bummed they did not serve their famous pizza until starting at 4 .... oh well, a reason to come back!  I had what was called the commuter sandwich - whatever kind of meat you want, eggs, tomatoes on their home made english muffin ... WOW is all I can say - soft and melt in your mouth.  Not what you would think from a English Muffin...  I also had a blueberry muffin - it was, without a doubt, the best I have ever had.  I wish this place was a little closer because I would be here all the time.  It was neat too, because I also saw Ryan Sandburg (chicago cubbies legend) eating here.  I didn't get my stalk on and ask for an autograph, but it still was cool to see him there.  I grew up watching him LOL.   Anyway - can't wait to go back to this place.

This is where we held the SMX Social Media Epic Dinner AZ .... the staff was amazing.  The food was even better.  I loved doing it the way we did because I got to try a lot of dishes I would not normally order.  Lots of food and dessert and everyone left happy.  Again, I can't thank the staff enough ... they were amazing and paid attention to detail.  Our waiter specifically was awesome.  I forget his name, but he was the one who could pick up an odd shaped M&M with chopsticks .. YOU ROCKED DUDE!

I am a fan of these guys now because they did everything they could to change my mind about the place from my first experience.  I had the pulled pork sandwich this time and it really was good.    HOWEVER:  If I could give them any advice it would be to lower their prices a bit because I still feel for 40 bucks (my experience with my wife and two kids meals added up to $41.50)  I would rather go into a place like Texas Roadhouse and sit down and get served (what I feel is better food too) - rather then have to do it all myself (like this place) for the same money.  Anyway - I appreciate the owner at Joe's for doing his best to change my mind about his place but I just can't write something here I don't feel is true.  It was much better food this second time around, but still feel its to much for what you get.

My mind has been changed about this place, upgrading my last reviews.  I guess 3rd time is the charm, but the pulled pork "jumbo" sandwich and sides were amazing this time around.  I had the mac and cheese (love the crust) and the potatoes were perfect.  Everyone else in the group loved what they got too and had no complaints.  It is pricey for having to serve yourself, but I guess I don't mind as much when its this damn good!

Have to agree with some of the reviews here. You should only go here if you want to lose a lot of weight quickly from vomiting and the other end all night long. Dirty dirty dirty. Everything is dirty and nasty and on top of it all they charge you way to much. Chuckie cheese is a cleaner place then this and I would not want my dog eating off the floor of this place.  I am sorry to be so harsh, but this is the sad reality of this place.  If you own the place and are reading this, fix it up a little - do a better job and more people would probably come.  Think about quality and your kids eating and playing there.

Bummed that I have to be the downer here ... but got a dozen roses for my wife for our 12 year anniversary and feel I was charged way to much for the flowers to start wilting and dying not even a day later ... seriously I have bought roses that looked better from Target several days later than these did.  Maybe if I paid the same price as Target I wouldn't be complaining, but I didn't ... I paid A LOT more in hope that I would have gotten a better product.  (and not be the cheap husband that always goes to Target last minute .. I actually thought this one out hahaha)  The gal that runs the place the the delivery guy was awesome .. even when they delivered they broke a rose and went back and brought us 3 new ones to make up for the one that they accidentally broke on delivery.    The store was an awesome little store too.  Just bummed that the roses didn't last for more than a 24 hour period for what I paid .. that is my biggest issue ...

After a couple more years giving them chances do I feel good about leaving a 5 star review now. You will pay more here (based on ALL other flower shops I've been too), but the roses seem to be high quality & last longer than before when I'd come here (years ago) .... anyway friendly service and delivery right on time. A nice local shop that I hope keeps thriving.

My niece told me this place was the "bomb" so we tried it. My wife said the salad was fresh and tasty.  It looked good to me as well. Staff was friendly and the place was jammed. This place does not have much seating but we were able to sit right down.   Pizza we ordered was the "party" a big 24 incher. Half. Pepperoni half. Cheese. (kids). The pizza was probably, no the best, I have ever had in the Phx area. Go here if you love NY style thin folding pizza (like I do).   Wish I could give it 10 stars!!  Will be back here from now on when I want pizza.

Had the boneless wings this time around. Mild and honey BBQ split (amzing) - truly tasty. Loved it and of course still the best NYC style pizza in the valley.  Fold over gewey-cheezy, greasy goodness.  Do not go here if you are looking for something healthy ... go here to get full on bad for you food!

What a surprise.  Who would have thought a place like this would be found in Gila Bend?   Crazy good pizza.  My 5 star rating is for the pizza only.  I did not have anything else, but everything else looked great that my family was having.  Service was great, place was clean and the staff was super friendly.  I will make sure and go back to this place on my trips to San Diego and recommend it highly for anyone else in the area or driving through.

How can anyone not give these guys a 5 star?  Cafe Rio invented the sweet pork burrito and nobody...and I mean NOBODY can do it better.  I moved here a year ago from Utah where Cafe Rios are as abundant as Micky Dees .... and I was so happy to see the Cafe Rio sign.    I eat there to much.  Its a 30 min drive to get there from where I live, but I love that I don't ever have to wait in line as long as I did when eating at the Utah ones...  Let me help you with what to order:  No serious if you are reading this...go there TODAY and order this -   Sweet pork burrito with black beans, hot sauce, enchilada style with pico and guac ... no lettuce (unless you like lettuce ... I don't)

Because of this NNY I will never eat at another one. I wish I could leave no stars. I got served a hamburger with Brillo pad cooked in it. Then they only gave me 1/2 off the cost of my bill. Worthless. They should have comped the meal because I didn't finish it and was grossed out. Do not go to this NNY

I love PPP but this location SUCKS. Avoid it. If you like their pizza as much as I do then go to the one on Williams Field and Lindsay (I think) as it's much better.   This location for some reason has been off everytime. I had given them 4 chances but after the 4th and the taste being the same. That was it. No more.

Great service.  This is one of the best experiences I have ever had at a Red Robin.  We were in the mood for burgers and something the kids could eat that was close to where we were at when we were out and about.  I have not had anything else on the menu but this is a great place for burgers.  Check out the pics if you want to see for yourself.

I like Serranos and am a HUGE FAN - I think they have very good Mexican food, but I have always thought the Queen Creek one could have better customer service, and do a little more to make their facilities more clean.  Nothing wrong that I would never eat there again, but I just feel they got to relaxed being the only Mexican Food choice out in QC for so long.  They have competition now, and they need to step it up to keep customers from going elsewhere.  I am a huge fan of their Machaca, but they are not consistent.  Sometimes very hot (almost to hot for this white boy to enjoy) and sometimes not hot enough (in case you were actually looking for a food review - ha)  Everything I have had their has been good - especially if you love tacos.  very yummy - just want them to step it up a little.

Top notch, in every aspect.  I would highly recommend going here if you are looking for a honest & intelligent eye Dr.  We came here for my son, as a second opinion and they have much better facilities, staff and customer service than some of the other cheaper options (like Wal Mart or Target)  They talked us through what was going on and all options and made it as nice as possible for my little guy.

You know, we get a lot of crap living way out here, but I really love my town.  I love the small town feel and the hidden gems that you find when you are not looking.  Sure, we have some idiots in office that have made bad decisions, but I think as we get a little bigger (not to big I hope) there will be more voice from the people in this small town.  Roads need fixing for sure, but we chose to live out here, at least I did, so I knew what they were like - so for me to sit and do nothing but complain about it would be idiotic.  You knew what you were getting into people!  Anyway, I really do love it out here and plan on making this my home until I can afford a house on the beach in Ventura (true goal someday)  Even so, I will probably keep my home here and go between the two places - that's how much I love the desert and living out here!  Thanks for helping me have a happy life with my family out here Queen Creek!!

You ever thought of a life without Costco. I know. Scary thought. I love Costco (but I'm also easily amused). It's the only place I can snack (for free) while I'm walking around shopping. Brilliant.  Guys like buying anything bigger. Bigger is better - RIGHT?? Life is good at Costco, and I will continue to spend way to much money there!

Ok, found a new place to eat Chinese food in the QC.  This place was the best Chinese I have had here in the area.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some good Chinese food.  I had the sesame chicken, and we also got the sweet & sour chicken and veggie order.  Everyone was happy and each "single" serving can easily feed two big sized people.

Typical panda express. Great orange chicken and chow mein.  Everything is fresh and just hard to beat when you want this style food fast.  I am just glad they have one closer to us in the further out areas of Queen Creek.

They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.    The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4.

Some of the better pizza I've had. Top 5 for sure. It's a little slow but good priced and worth.  They have some amazing garlic bread ball things you can get before the mean (or anytime I guess) and one time they hooked us up with some free dessert because the food took so long to come out.  So here is the just of it - they had some service issues, but the food and how they tried to take care of us made up for it!  Will (and have gone back) to this place again!

A LOT of hype surrounding this place because of Triple D (the Show on Food Network)  Anyway, been here for breakfast and lunch and always looking forward to coming back.  This morning all the normal breakfast foods were loved.  My kids love this place and are always happy with breakfast.   I love the pulled pork sandwich & ribs and everything else I have ever had here.  Truly a great place.  I have not tried the pastrami and some of the other stuff that has made this place famous, but I will eventually get to it.    This place has a really great environment too - good for kids.  They do have seats inside if you are wondering.  You do not have to sit outside if there are open tables inside.  Every time I have gone there has been places to sit inside.   Go try it if you have been thinking about it.  Really great food and great service.

Really good hamburger with great sides.  You get served a big burger and can share sides....yes, they are big enough.  We got fried pickles, garlic fries and sweet potato fries.  The dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries was killer ... highly recommend you get to just try the sauce.  It is like a tangy bbq type sauce, but holy crap it's good.  It was a really good hamburger, but not the best I have ever had, thus only 4 stars.  A great place to give a try if you find yourself in Vegas looking for something out of the ordinary ... and even though its Vegas and its called "Strip Burger"  there are no strippers in case any of you were wondering.....

Love the playground for kids at this one.  For that reason alone - 5 stars.  I mean its a chick-fil-a and you know what kind of food they have, so nothing amazing, but always good service and good food.  The staff is always friendly and asking how they can help.

I'm giving this one a 4 because I first ate at (and found out about) Lucilles at the Vegas location.  Over there it was spectacular - here its just amazing.  They give you so much food its unreal.  You can try anything BBQ you want or ever dreamed of.  You get these amazing biscuits with this butter stuff that is just like candy before the meal, and almost get full just with these.  SO MUCH FOOD, go hungry and get ready to be amazed.  Some of the better BBQ in the area.  I look forward anytime I have the opportunity to visit a Lucilles.  Just can't wait till I go visit the Vegas one again!

Let's see here, where to begin.  The food is typical buffet - and there were so many choices.  I felt like I had to try everything.  After eating breakfast here everyday we never needed lunch!  It kept us until dinner, and in Vegas - that's important.  They had all typical breakfast food, fruit, pastries, and unique items that I tried for the first time.    Service was good and the price is reasonable (for a decent buffet) about 12 bucks a person (I have had ones in Vegas for 24 that were crap compared to this)  All in All A good experience, and if I ever catch myself at the TI again I will go back!

I honestly don't know how anyone (who ate what I ate at least) could give this place anything BUT 5 stars.  I am giving it 5 stars even though I did not like the salty chips or salsa - that's how good the main course was .... I had the special "3 course meal" thing they had ... started off with some nacho things that were AMAZING ... SO GOOD - pork ones by far were my favorite - then onto the main course which was a steak and enchilada - the meat was so flavorful on this it was crazy, and it was ended with flan for dessert ... very tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.  This is probably  my new favorite spot for Mexican food in the east valley from now on.  GO TRY IT

Horrible Food that has only one thing going for it - a "view" if you are into the "Hooters on Steroids" atmosphere.  This is a place for men, and I mean it.  Leave the kids at home, and make sure to come hungry.  This place has everything needed for success - CONTROVERSY!

Had the rib tips and Georgia style chopped pork, and it was probably the most amazing BBQ meal I have had in a Looooong time.  I am a fan - a huge fan of daves even more now.  Fall of the bone goodness, and amazing sides.   They took care of us - and there was 9 of us, and we all had full drinks, and never had a want.  Worth the money spent, and will go back to this location soon.

The breakfast is what I like about this place.  They have such an amazing breakfast that includes traditional American means and the traditional Mexican breakfast foods.    Everything I have had - pancakes, hash browns, eggs etc, or the chorizo burrito and other Mexican breakfasts - It was all yummy.    If you are tired of only having fast food options for breakfast in the un-incorporated Pinal county (they call Queen Creek) then try this place - you will not be let down.

Look, they are trying to make money and are pushy .... all you gotta do is tell them no, and exactly what you want and they will back off you.  I only suggest this because they do good work and I am always impressed with how my vehicles look after they do a detail (or VIP wash) .... go there but just remember you dont have to deal with the pushy annoying peeps ... just put them in their place and move on!!

***************UPDATE************  they won their law suit and dancing is now allowed at San Tan Flats ... GOOD FOR THEM and shame on the idiots that were fighting them so hard .... don't you guys got better stuff to be wasting our tax dollars on then a contributing member of our community????  SHAME ON THE LAW MAKERS OF PINAL COUNTY FOR DRAGGING THIS ON SO LONG!!!!!  The best place to get a "burger" in Queen Creek where dancing is not allowed.  Yea, get this - Dancing is banned outside in Pinal County.  Can you believe we got a modern day "Footloose" in Queen Creek Arizona?  All we are missing is Kevin Bacon.  Back to San Tan Flats - this is the funnest place to eat in all of Queen Creek.  They got plasmas to watch the game, and amazing food and huge running room for the kids to play and (not dance).    GO THERE IF YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT!

It's different. But it's good and for that reason it gets 5 stars. They have great breakfast sandwiches and anything my wife had had she has raved about. You can tour the place and shop as well.  This would be a fun afternoon for anyone who is bored.

Really do love this place.  One thing to note is there are not a lot of options for kids to eat, but I think the owners would prefer it that way with as many glass bottles as they have everywhere (with olive oil of course)  There are options though - grilled cheese, but not the plain boring kind kids like ... they are the kind us adults like and enjoy hahah.    Anyway - great sandwiches and breakfast options ... great for non meat eaters, they also have gelato now which is a bonus!  This place was featured on food network "Best thing I ever ate" so its got a lot of people ALL THE TIME.  Enjoy though, its a great place.  They have expanded since the first time I went (size and menu) so that is why I wanted to update ... no more just a few options ... they got a full menu with lots of stuff I wanna try.

I love this place, but the only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star is because when it comes to BBQ only Texas Roadhouse gets a 5 star rating IMHO.  Waldos is inexpensive and good, and worth a visit if you have never been there and are looking for yummy BBQ.  Fun environment, and funny pictures with funny sayings on the wall and they ALWAYS have sports playing - so thats a bonus.  Great place overall!

Gone down in quality and service.   Mashed potatoes are horrible now. The meat was still just as good as ever, but two stars cause they changed the portion size (but same price). Don't know if I went on bad day. I'll give another chance since I'm such a huge fan but this was sad today.

My 7 year old Daughter (2nd Grade) use to attend San Tan Elementary, but after every night of her coming home crying because of the lack of discipline in the school I pulled her out, and took the available spot Edu-prize had called me about.  Edu-prize has changed my daughters life, and she is reading better then ever, getting hundreds on her spelling tests, and is even doing really well in Math and LOVES going to school.  She has had such an easy time making friends in Edu-prize, and her teacher Mrs. Gant is AMAZING and I would ask for her if you have a kid going into the second grade.  So far all the teachers my daughter has dealt with at Edu-prize have been amazing and you are one of the lucky ones if you are able to get your kids into this school!

I know I know, Donuts are bad for you, but we went out when we saw the hot and ready - and those are the best ones to get.  They melt in your mouth and are so good.  I agree that I have had better Donuts, but when it comes to right off the press melt in your mouth I don't think anything beats a Krispy Kreme.  Kids love watching them be glazed, get a free hat and just kick back and have some family time.

Some places I wish I could give more then 5 stars because they really deserve it - this is one of them.  The service was OUTSTANDING and the food was even better.    For Starters: I had the shrimp and eggplant (forgot the exact name) appetizer, and my wife had a salad, but this was not just any ordinary salad, the presentation was amazing and it tasted even better.  The bread they give you free along with some kind of tortilla with spices on it - AMAZING.  Can's say it enough, this place is amazing and it is now going to be a REGULAR spot for my wife and I.  For The Main Course: I had the 14 oz. strip with potatoes and veggies.  My steak had such flavor and was in the top 3 of steaks that I have ever eaten.  My wife had some kind of chicken dish that I snuck a few bites off of, and it was very tasty as well.  They served her two huge pieces of chicken, and she could only make her way through 1/2 of one (which was fine for me - because I went above and beyond my call of duty as a man, and helped her out by finishing it.  Dessert: I wish, we were to stuffed to even move.    Final Notes: We stayed and talked for about an hour after our meal was done and they kept our drinks filled and made sure we were ok.  They were not put off by us staying either.  This is a great place and if you have not gone yet - GO!  It is a bit on the pricey side, but WELL WORTH every cent spent!  Enjoy!

Wow. I had the Lasagna this time, and let me just say one thing about it: Amazing. What's funny is the kids spagetti was good too lol - I think next time I will get it ... It was good AND big enough of a serving after eating all the bread and stuff.  I love Brio and can't wait to keep going back and trying more on the menu.

I love this place. The filet is great but the cheesecake is why this place is famous. My wife really does not like the food here but everything I have had is great.  My wife thinks the food is to "rich". I say bring the richness on LOL. Kids love this place too. Be prepared to drop some cash though.

I am giving them 5 stars today (not because of the food - which was very good) but for the excellent service we received.  I was truly amazed and how friendly and helpful they were (even with out stubborn 3 yr old)  The food was excellent - 4 star worthy, not 5 star because I have had better pasta.  My wife got a salad that looked great and my kid got the macaroni and cheese (which I snuck a bite of - and it was amazing)  Good food, better service = 5 stars in my book.  Keep it up!

Love sweet tomatoes. So do the kids so we don't have to fight them to go.  Every time I have been the food has been fresh and very tasty.  Its good to go to a place where you don't get so weighed down by heavy food and sauces.  They have Pizza and Mac & Cheese for the kids, Ice Cream and lots of desserts.  Plenty of soups and chili, and all different kinds of muffins and bread and of course SALAD.  Any and every kind you could ever want.

I wasn't going to do another review of this place, but felt I needed to give a holiday update.  They have this Turkey soup thing with cornbread stuffing that is amazing.  SO GOOD.  I am not sure how long it will be there, but if its still there you have to try it!  Or put it on the calendar for next year.  Adults love this place, kids love this place ... its a win win, and the food (and service) is always great!

This is a brand new Texas Roadhouse opened up closer to me (yea) and I finally ate there for the first time last night.  I do not know if its because its new or what, but the service was out of this world and the food portions were HUGE.  It was probably one of the best Texas Roadhouse that I have ever ate at.   I had the ribs (of course - you don't go here for any other reason) and the pulled pork. and get that most every time I go.  They have the best Chili I have ever tasted, and I just love the service and atmosphere.    If you live near this area and are wanting to find a place with good ribs then STOP LOOKING - you found it.   One other thing to note is that most of the time you eat here you have a wait, but they did this location right.  They did a HUGE waiting area inside with air conditioning, and for those of you that have ate over at the other Gilbert location ... you know that's a BIG deal.  I think they thought of everything, now I just have to remember to not eat so much when I go there!

MY RANT:  So annoyed that they do not accept credit cards online or over the phone.  What kind of a stupid policy is that.  Especially ONLINE .. this is 2010 people!!!  They are probably losing a ton of money by not getting with the program.    When I visit them in person:  PIzza is ok, service borderline - Lets just hope these guys are working out the kinks, but just so everyone knows this is mostly a delivery stop.  I didn't know that it was, but they do have tables inside where you can eat, but I got the impression that they didn't like that???    Again, its good to get more selection out in Queen Creek (even if it is pizza) but lets hope the service picks up for those people who happen to dine in.  Lets also hope the food gets better.  It wasn't horrible, but it was not the best pizza I have had in the QC area!!!

Get ready to pay for it ... but be pleasantly surprised that it will not make you sad after the fact.  This place is  second to none.  I have been to several of these Brazilian type grills & none have provided the selection that his place does.    They serve a filet that is killer ... just melts in your mouth, and they bring you how ever much you can stuff in your face.  Well worth the money spent (even though it is quite a bit).  My suggestion if you love meat - don't waste any space on the salad bar area ... they also bring you mashed potatoes and fried bananas ... so good.  I want to go back and eat some more after writing this review.

Today was the second time I have had lunch at this place and WOW!!  My wife and I were driving around, talking about how bored we were about all the same fast food joints, and how nothing sounded good.  THEN I REMEMBERED - this place has to be the best kept secret of Queen Creek.  For being in the middle of nowhere the place was packed.  Crazy good food and the serve bottled cokes from Mexico which is a plus in my book!!!  I had the creamy tomato soup with grilled cheese and I stole a piece of my kids pizza.  Holy Cow - One of the best tasting pizzas I have ever had.  This place is fresh and good.  A MUST FOR ANYONE.  they got a good variety too so it wont get boring, and a good selection for the kids.  If you find yourself out in no mans land in Queen Creek - do yourself a favor and hit this place up.  Better yet - take the drive .. you will not regret!  Only downside is it is pricey, but very worth it since the food was so amazing.

What are you waiting for?  I can't believe you haven't gone and tried this place yet!!!!!  Get in your car right now and GO THERE ... Just like Monopoly ... do not pass go ... do not collect 200$  .... JUST GO STRAIGHT THERE ...  In all seriousness:  Freaking grand slam again!!! Tried something new again... every time I go I have to try something new here, cause its always been so amazing.    I had the angel hair pasta with meatballs that melted in your mouth.  My wife had the Cuban (I added pictures of them to make your mouth water - sorry bout that)  The meatballs were the tastiest things I have eaten in a while - I can honestly say that I have never had as good of a meatball as this place.  The texture is hard to describe, but it melts in your mouth and is so FREAKING good!!!  Where is the 10 star button, cause they would get it!!!  If you go there and do not like it, I will pay your bill - well no I wont, but I am pretty confident you'll love it!

Back again. Amazed again.  I can't get over their pizza.  it is the BEST pizza you will have anywhere in Queen Creek - hands down.  I am not kidding - Go try it.  Went with Brian L. for a lunch meeting, and they took great care of us.  Let us do our thing, and kept our drinks full.  Never acted like they wanted us to leave.  I love this kind of service.

I am so glad that a Paradise Bakery opened up close to my home in Queen Creek.  If you are looking for an amazing sandwich, salad or a great bowl of soup this is the right place.  Its crazy in Queen Creek, there are not very many places to eat sandwiches or food like this so again, very glad they opened up.  I would recommend the Paradise club, or the Cranberry Turkey Sandwich.  If you are looking for soup then I recommend the Tomato Basil.  I am not a huge fan of salad, but they have everything any salad lover could want.    To top it off, you get a cookie to complete your meal - and these cookies are much better then any cookie you have ever eaten (I PROMISE)    Usually when I go there, the staff is really nice, and the facilities are clean.  The only problem I have is at lunch time and it gets busy and often hard to find a place to eat, but not that its cooling off - maybe I can start to sit outside where they have lots of tables.    This area is growing, and businesses and places to eat are popping up everyday.  It is important we support them because even in some of these brand new areas shops and places to eat are going out of business.  You asked for more stuff Queen Creek, so support whats here!

This time around had the meatloaf and it was much better then anything I have ever had here. The mushrooms and grilled onions were the icing on the cake - oh and I LOVE their rolls they give you before the meal!  Much better experience this time around!

I was talking to a friend about how much I loved Ruth Chris Steakhouse and he suggested I try this place.  My wife and I finished up watching a movie and a steak just sounded good so I wanted to give the place a try.    After finding out it was my first time the manager came and offered me a free appetizer which was way cool of them ... to bad I am not a huge fan of Shrimp cocktails, but the gesture was amazing.  I ordered the 10oz filet which really was melt in your mouth goodness.  Its about 10 bucks cheaper then the filet at Ruth Chris but I have to admit I still like the steak at Ruth Chris better.  BUT DONT GET ME WRONG this was an amazing steak, its just hard to beat Ruth!!!  I also had the sweet potato fries which were amazing served with some kind of sauce that I still am not sure what it was, but it was amazing!!!    My wife had the sirloin and said it was really good too, and we both agree we will be going back to this place.  The service was tremendous and friendly and we got right in and the food service was quick.    A very good place for an amazing date night!!

What a great find hidden in a place where you would never expect it to be!  I love the beans and rice here so much.  Probably the best I have had of any Mexican food in Queen Creek.  The green chile is good too, not to hot, but spicy enough.  I am for sure going back to this place and trying more.  They serve breakfast all day, and it is homemade goodness style.  Pancakes, bacon, potatoes - anything you can image.  Great for the kids who hate Mexican food!  I can't believe it took me so long to try this (no kidding) hole in the wall place!  Can't wait to go back and try more on the menu.

The food was good, and the service was also good.  The lady taking my order even stopped texting when I needed something...  Its just a small little place, but very tasty.  I had the Philly Cheese steak and loved it.  Not the best I have had, but very good!  They serve crinkly fries with all their stuff, and you can never go wrong with crinkly fries right???  They got food for the kids, but there is a lot of Greek food there too that I want to try later.  I just felt like Cheese steak when I went!  If you are in Queen Creek and are looking for a change in food - try this place - it will be a good alternative.

Only had a pizza, but it was one of the best pizza I have had in a while.  My kids didn't enjoy the pizza as much, but hey ... what do they know right?  I want to go back here when I am hungry (we mostly came just to let the kids eat because my wife and i had a late lunch) but anyway ... I will come back and try other items on the menu that have been recommended by Yelpers here....   The place was nice, good environment and fun ... had the suns and world series on .... CANT BEAT THAT ...  I might upgrade them to 5 stars after I try other things, but the pizza was pretty good, just not the best I have had so I had to give it 4 stars.

Again, perfecto!  This place is becoming one of my fav stops. Good thing it's on the way home from soccer. Perfect end to an afternoon of soccer. What's funny is who knew this place would be so good for a cheeseburger.  Yea, they have a cheeseburger on the lunch specials.  Can't wait to go back and keep working my way through the menu.

Fun. Amazing Breakfast. Perfect for families.  We love this place and hope it stays open!  If you are in the mood for something different and some home town style cooking ... then this is the place.  The service has always been good, and they are very friendly.

I'm sorry for some of the experiences my fellow Yelpers had, but just checked out this place again and it was pretty amazing.   The owner was there, and the place was pact. Service was fast and I never felt we were let down. Almost gave them 4 stars this time because of portion size for the money paid. If I am gonna pay 10+ $$ per plate, the food needs to be falling off the plate (especially breakfast). But this food was well prepared this morning, so that is a huge plus.   I had the down south bisquits and gravy with a side of home style potatoes (much better then the potatoe cakes FYI). Everyone else had either pancakes, stuffed French toast, bacon, eggs and fruit and loved it.   I am not a huge fan of cinnamon, so I don't like their pancakes, but if you do, then you will love then.  (my son does)   Every time I have went for breakfast it's been good, so I'm sorry to those that have had bad experiences, but I'd urge you to try them again.

Yuk. Will never eat here again. It was dis organized and food was undercooked and tasteless.  Honestly - that's really all I have to say about this place ... sadly enough!  Will not be going back.

Make sure you have plenty of time to spend with family and talk .... this place takes forever to bring food, but that's not a bad thing.  They did everything they could to keep the kids entertained - bread dough to play with - which they LOVED.  Plenty of bread to eat and refils kept coming.  The food was so fresh and good that I did not mind the wait.  Probably one of the best Italian places I have ever eaten at in the valley.  So glad Queen Creek got this gem, I just hope the location does not kill them until that airport gets a little bigger!  Pizza, Chicken, Pasta ... everything was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try more!

Went at better time. Around 6 on a Monday.  Much less people and even better service.  I used the coupons I had gotten from that 90% off deal and they worked like a charm ... They serve you so much food, I would suggest just getting it split in two before they even bring it to you ... although I often don't do that and eat to much!! hahaha ... amazing service, amazing food and a great environment!  They even had MNF (Monday Night Football) playing on the big screens!! NICE!!

Ok, for starters we had the avocado egg rolls. This alone makes this place 5 star worthy. Even my 9 year old loved them.   They have good choices for kids, for a nicer place. My kids got pizza and had no complaints.  I had the macadamia crusted chicken and it was decent. My wife had the meatloaf but wasn't impressed for the money.   Overall not bad, I would come back for the egg rolls though and give other stuff on the menu a try.   Staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't notice many cougars, but it wasn't happy hour, nor was I at the bar. Haha

I am a fan of this place, but its not as good as it gets.  It is one of the better Chinese food buffets I have ever been to, but only because of selection.  There is something for everyone here, and the people in charge let us bring our kids in and destroy the place and they seem to love em too.  The food is good, but not the best I have ever had, but I will keep going back to this place because of the selection and how easy it is to bring the kids without feeling like you are annoying everyone!

I had no idea it was going to be so hot that I would not be able to taste anything for days after.  I am all for hot food, but this was NUTS!!  Was the joke on me?  who knows, but I will probably NEVER eat at this place again based on how hot the food was.    I had the Green Chili burrito and could taste nothing but unbelievable HEAT.

Really good "I hate Sushi" menu with lots of choices.  My review is for the Beef Teriyaki .... my only gripe is its not a huge portion for what you pay.  I would have loved more of the beef, and sauce to go with the mountain of rice they give you.  The flavor and taste is amazing.  Probably top 5 of all teriyaki bowls/dinner/whatever that I have ever had.  My wife was not as big of a fan of this place as I was, but I will let her do her own review.  I want to go back and try the Sushi, if I don't chicken out again.  I just am not a huge raw food (especially slimy fish kind)  i have heard the Lolipop roll is outstanding.  I do want to go back and try more of the "I hate Sushi" menu because it reminds me a lot of one of my favorite places all time to eat (Happy Sumo)  If you are wondering if you can bring the kids, they have food for them too.  I think everyone can be satisfied at this place.

Pulled pork sliders. FTW and 2$ off on Mondays - how can you beat that?  The service was awesome and the food was incredible ... How come it took me so long to try this place out??  Should have taken Mike F's advice sooner and gone out here (thanks Mike)  Wife loved it and so did my son.  I will be back for sure to try other things on the menu.  So glad I found this place. (with the help of my fellow yelpers that is)

This review is for this experience I just had.  I have had much better experiences before at this place though, but here is my follow up - Don't get the Fajitas.  I know I should know better then to get them at a place like this, but hey, if they are on the menu?  They sounded good, don't judge me!  Service was bad, orders were brought out wrong.  A bad day perhaps?  But this is the problem with these kind of places.  They need to work on being consistent.   Just take this as a warning, don't ever get the fajitas ... (but if you like chewing rubber and never being able to swallow, then knock yourself out)

Read the reviews and kept seeing this place pop up on other sites so I decided I wanted to try.  I am really glad I did.  Amazing service & food with even better dessert.  Kids eat free on Monday & Wednesday so that was a bonus.  Reasonable prices on the ice cream.    I can't wait to go back and try more.  This is a great place to go when you want a "home cooked" style meal.  Great job on this place (to the owners)!

It is kind of fitting that this review is my 200th on Yelp.  These momentous occasions just wouldn't be fitting with a "normal ole review".... it had to be something amazing, or..........embarrassing (well, not really embarrassing - just seriously worried about losing man points here)  Don't Judge Me........  Yes, I went and got a pedicure..........  but let me ask you this - Where else are you going to get a 50 minute foot massage and scrub (legs too) while sitting in a chair that massages you and enjoy good conversation (with my wife) ????   We had friends that go and do this, and my wife said yes (to the double date), hoping I would be down.  I was - we enjoyed a good time, good conversation and I would challenge another man on here to tell me that his wife would rub his feet for 50 minutes and do all they do - It seriously felt good and I will continue to go back and do these.    Does it mean I lose man points?  Maybe ...... but with something that feels as good as it did, I will gladly take the risk.

Just a normal what to expect KFC. Our orders have always been correct drive through or eat in. To me it tastes like every other KFC.  4 stars because service could be a little faster.

Now this is what I am talking about!  This Costa Vida has what the other one was missing!  Huge portions, sauce good and the sweet pork was amazing.  I love this place and am so glad we finally got one in Queen Creek.  The only thing I would beg you Queen Creek is to get off your butts and go so it stays open - you know how food joints have been closing left and right lately so GO EAT HERE and keep it open.    It is amazing and such good food!  The pork burrito is the best, but everything on the menu is tasty!  My wife loves the salads, but they have tacos, enchaladas and its a fun place too.  the kids will love it p ours do.   they have this water mural thing and the kids just stare and stare at it.    Again. the food is amazing and I would encourage you - if you like Mexican food and live in QC - go suppor this place and keep it open!

Sad to give this place a 1 star cause I love the food, and every time I have been to any Carrabba's it has been amazing (food wise) but this specific one gets a ONE STAR FOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.    We got to the place and they said about 5 min wait, and since we have kids, that was perfect - if it was longer we would have went somewhere else....so we wait and wait and wait ... I go ask and they say they are working on getting our table.  Long story short they forgot about us and we ended up waiting almost 45 min before we got seated....we decided to stay so long because we thought it was "almost ready" and did not expect it to turn out the way it did.  Then the waiter got our food messed up - good thing everything on the menu is good because my wife got half of mine, and I got half of hers and then the waiter goes nuts trying to blame everyone else  Very unprofessional!  Horrible service and will probably not go back to this one again unless they convince me otherwise!

Seems kinda silly to only base a review of closing time (they serve mainly breakfast and lunch) but I loved them (in reference to the one star this place got - NOT WARRANTED). Nice friendly owners. It was their one year business birthday. Free cake. They have tomato basil soup (it was just ok) but they have sandwiches, salads, smoothies - sweets and of course coffee .... I enjoyed this place.  It is a weak 4, but still worthy of a 4.  I will probably be back to try more stuff.

Good solid 4 stars. I enjoy the breakfast burritos & breakfast food in general here. There are healthy options too for veggie & vegan peeps. Very friendly & affordable.  They serve baked goods & ice cream too and they have kid options.

Ok, let me give you a real honest review of Carmax. They get two stars cause the guy I met with was awesome (wish I remembered his name).  Other then that ... Let me really tell you about carmax. They give you an appraisal (takes about 30 min) and they say they give you fair value after all marketing costs etc. ORLY?  My vehicle was going to get me 16k for a trade in at dealer across the street, and books at 18,100. Their offer? 12k. It's gonna cost 4-6k to market. I think not.   If you are looking to sell your car, go to craigslist, autotrader or ads or put a sticker on your window. You will get more money.  Fair value? When even a dealership (normal one) offers me more. You know there's something wrong.   My 2 cents is all this is though ...  Oh yea and they will email you results. The info you give them will get you emailed and snail mailed ... Constantly. You have been warned.

I had the opportunity to try out a brand new "hot" spot for the community - Yogurt Jungle, now open at the Queen Creek Marketplace!  My pictures are not going to do the place justice so you will have to go check it out for yourself, but it truly was a fun place.  The kids LOVED IT.  You are able to select the kind of frozen yogurt you want - which has a cool feature - LCD screens to tell you what the flavors of the day are.  You pay per the ounce, and although it was not cheap, it was much more cheaper then say Cold Stone  I really enjoyed our visit and would recommend anyone in the area check it out.  I think on June 26th they will be "officially" open and will be giving away FREE YOGURT to everyone who comes in.  Not a bad little PR stunt to drum up business and awareness.   Again, this is a great little addition to our little (but growing) community!

Agree with Mike F. Amazing how much food for so little. One thing about this location that I like is it's in a strip mall place and newer and nice and clean.   The tacos are amazing and one of the better green chili burros I have ever had.   Kids food too. We can all find something to eat here.

My only complaint with OUTBACK ever is the fact that you have to wait so long to sit down.  It always seems there are many tables open, so why can't they just sit everyone.  Any steak I have ever had is amazing cooked perfect (med-rare).  My kids beg me to go to outback, they love the Macaroni and I have to admit, its not half bad.    The desserts are amazing too - anything they have will tickle your taste buds.

Thank you my fellow Yelpers ... you did not let me down on this one.  So glad I tried this place.   I wanted to find a steakhouse closer that was not San Tan Flats, I mean I like that place and all, but I wanted a Ruth Chris style/The Keg style filet somewhere closer.  Trophys provides and came through like no other!!  Ruth Chris (in my book) is still the best, but WOW this one comes in as a close second .. CLOSE!  It was melt in your mouth 8 OZ. of goodness.  The filet is about 1/2 the cost of Ruth Chris too.  I will be a regular now.    It's cool inside they have a small version of what you could find in a Bass Pro shop (animal wise) very cool - the kids LOVED it and they had a good kids menu.     This steak was by far MUCH MUCH better then anything you can get closer.  Much better then Outback, Texas Roadhouse, Logans ... YOU NAME IT ... I thought this one was better in regards to all the stuff close.  My only gripe was it was a little slow on service.  Our drinks were dry a few times and we had to wait longer then I would have liked.  I also hate when I get my soup, salad and bread the same time as the entre.  Other then that its still 5 star worthy cause of how good it was!!  My wife had the chicken salad of some sort (see picture) and she loved it and said it was very good.  She also tried my filet and said it was really good.  (she's hard to please too - trust me ... I know!!!  haha)  Good job Trophy's .... You made a believer out of me and a regular!  Cant wait to go back!

Again, perfection. Had the 12 oz NY strip this time around. Look at it. It's beautiful. Almost sad to eat it .... Uh jk. Loved it.  As good as it was though, I think I will never stray from the filet again .... I am so glad I found this place and I am glad QC is filling it - this place MUST stay in business - its the best steak within 30 min of my house!  Please QC ... go and you will fall in love like I have, and we will never have to worry about them going out of business!!  Yea!!!

Burgers and shakes. They do them well.  For that they get 5 stars.  No really - anything and everything I have ever had here is great.  You also get to listen to the tunes you want for 5 cents.

Food was good (same as last time - and as always when I go) but they lose a star for service.  Look, you may hate your job, and hate the singing in front of everybody part of it, but YOU signed up for it.  If you don't like it - go get a new job!  Good thing I like their burgers so much or this might have annoyed me enough to not go back!

Agree with the other reviews here ... this place is great.  I took my tire in the other day because it was registering low tire pressure on one of the tires ... found out I had a screw - I couldn't remember if that was the tire I bought from them or not, but they fixed it for free anyway!  Very good customer service.  I have gotten rims for my truck twice before from them and the price was right.     They are always willing to check your air, and assist you and really don't do a lot of hard selling and up-selling .. this alone makes me wanna keep coming back.

Today the service and food was amazing.  Much better then the last time we went.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so after visiting Dicks Sporting Goods, it seemed like the right choice (its right next door)  We had the onion rings for the appetizer and it was really good.  Everyone left happy and full.  Will def go back since they got everything together now.

These guys rule!  I am not exactly the kind of guy that wears a suit and tie - If it were not for Church, I would not even own one.  Business?  Who cares?  You will always catch me in shorts, tshirt and flip flops .... WELL, that said - I know nothing about suits and matching and all that crap.  Went here cause I had need of a suit for something at Church and these guys took care of me, and made this ugly man look presentable.  They were no pressure, they made sure I felt comfortable, and they didn't try to sell me something, or push me into something that I didn't want or need.  And, they got my suit tailored on the same day - ready to go - out the door all in the same day!  Great service.  I also had to go to these guys for my brothers wedding a few months back (to get a tux) and they did a great job again - everything fit perfect and my brothers wedding was a huge success - and again, they even made me look half way decent.  Great staff, friendly and they really do try to help you out and answer all your questions!

Loved it!  This was my first time to this location and they did not let me down.  If you ever go here - GET THE avocado egg rolls!!  WOW amazing, and they give you this sauce that is like candy.  My niece went with me and she does not like to try anything so I got to eat all them suckers by myself!!!  haha..  I had the sliders and wedge fries and there was so much food I had lunch to bring home to my wife too.  Great service and friendly cool environment!  I will be back to try other stuff - their pasta looked delish so I wanna try that!!

My review is for their breakfast buffet - if this were a review for their normal lunch and dinner buffet it would be a different story.  I got a flier in the mail that told me they had breakfast in the mornings now - a buffet - and MAN was I impressed - not even kidding you, the ethnic food they serve buffet is maybe a 2 star so this surprised the heck out of me.  This is one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever been to.  I forgot my iPhone or I would have snapped a few shots of the buffet (which has anything and everything you can imagine for breakfast food)   But if you have ever trusted me as a Yelper, then give this place a shot for breakfast.   The french toast, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, all kinds of potatoes, eggs (way good) and they even have the tempura chef ready to cook to order...  Go there and try it out if you are in or near Queen Creek - so glad we have a place so close now that we can trust for breakfast!  If you check out this place let me know what you thought of my recommendation because I think this place is the bomb. (for breakfast)

Dr Goates is an amazing dentist. We had an emergency chipped tooth with my son (see pictures) and he fixed him right up and you can't tell a difference. Not to mention we were in and out of there in less than an hour! The staff was amazing, they all talked and never seemed put off. The building has a good calm feel to it. I'm grateful that we decided on Dr Goates. We will bringing the whole family here now for our dentist work. It's not a far drive from Queen Creek to Gilbert either. Worth the drive for this level of service and professionalism. Main thing is my son looks good and you cannot even tell he chipped his tooth (and it's a front top one) highly recommended!

Really good pulled pork sandwich with secret sauce made by owner. So. Good. I have also had chicken parmesan here, which I love.  I keep going back because they do not dissapoint. Kids love the spaghetti and pizza too.  Sorry, there is not much more to this review (check out the pics I took that might help) but the food is just dang good and every time I have been its been good.    Why not the 4 stars then?  the place is hot - simply put they have an air conditioning issue and every time I have been I have been hot (even during this time of year when its cool)

I enjoy some burros because it's a good cross between fast food and sit down Mexican food.  The taste is always fresh, and good - the service is fast and friendly, even with a packed house.  It satisfies my Mexican fix and does not leave me regretting life afterwords .... (like Filbertos does)  I have only had this location, but have gone back numerous times and will continue to hit this place up and work my way through the menu ... I had the beef taco and been enchilada today ... see pictures ... you will want.

So, pretty dang impressed by this place for sure.  These guys took the food quality to the next level compared to all the other places serving the same style of food.  I had the veggie lo mein and it was fantastic ... cheap prices too - the lunch menu was big, lots of choices and I think mine was like 5.95 ... super cheap and so much food.  Great service and I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu....everything that all the rest of my group got looked amazing too and smelled so good.  They all said it was top quality and taste too.  MUST GO BACK SOON!!!!

This place ended up being a pleasant surprise, and I am also surprised it is not on Yelp yet.  It's got a decent location, so again not sure why others have not been Yelping it.  I had the Sesame Chicken, which my three year old ate almost the whole plate - SO I ended up eating his Teriyaki Chicken (which was very good) too.  My wife got a Veggie plate and said it was really good too.  Good to have another choice in Queen Creek for Chinese because there are not that many good ones out here.  Go try it, I really don't think you will be disappointed!

This is my fav. in the area.  Main reason?  They have a play school/day care area to check your little ones in while you watch a movie.  Kind of how Ikea has one so you can shop without yelling screaming kids, and the kids have fun too.

Where can I even begin on this one?  Overwhelming does not even describe the amount of food you are brought ... They have no small meals here.  if you are grossed out by insane amounts of food and over the top creations ... this place is not for you.  Lucky for me I am a Man v Food type of guy and LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  WOW ... just thinking back I can't wait until I got to Vegas again JUST FOR THIS PLACE!  I had the chorizo plate, but the pancakes were huge, biscuits were huge, eggs benedict were huge (man v food chicken one was crazy) ...  BEST SERVICE in all of Vegas ... we got taken care of ... my only recommendation is calling ahead and getting reservations ... there is a lot of people that want to try this place so be prepared.    Can't wait to go back and try more - everyone with my group loved what they got and went back to hotel and passed out in a food coma!

I am a fan of Ice Cream! There is really no other place near me (that I know of) that is a good place to go and just get Ice Cream (yogurt aside), so that is why I am reviewing a Cold Stone!  I really do like their Ice Cream too!  I always get the cheesecake fantasy or whatever its called, but it is by far my favorite!  We come here and it is always good, service is always the same, the place is clean and there is never a wait (or a long wait)  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too.

I just don't understand why some people hate on Papa! :-)  Seriously I love their BBQ Hawaiian pizza & pepperoni .... always had on time delivery from this location and if they screwed something up they always gave me a discount or something free (they tried to make it better)  I dig that.

These guys were awesome enough to help me out with some questions I had about some plants dying in my back yard.  Found it its because of some virus they pick up at the nursery.  I have not used them for any tree issues or services yet, but I will FOR SURE come back to them when I have a need - just because of how they took the time to answer my questions and help out (and I didn't even pay them to do so). Very cool when businesses act like this IMO!!!!

Really good pizza and they do a ton of local fundraisers with the schools, so what's not to like about that?  I really enjoy their wings too!  A favorite of mine is the BBQ chicken pizza.  A must!  So as far as chain places go, this one is by far, and i mean BY FAR the best!

5 star for service, and what can I say ... I'm a sucker for their chicken.  Love the way the nuggets taste, especially with the poly sauce.  They go out of their way to be nice, give fast friendly service...I mean, whats not to love about that?

Simply the best Arizona Blinds company you will ever come across!  We recently moved into a new house that had 26 windows that needed blinds.  I thought I was going to go broke just buying window coverings!!!    I was going to just go to Home Depot and buy the blinds etc., but had a friend suggest the fellas at Window Pro because he was telling me their blinds were better price & quality than anything I could get at Home Depot.  They did not let me down.  Just a side note; I had 26 windows to cover so there was no way I was going to afford shutters, but they also offer shutters for those interested.  They have scheduled to come back and measure for sunshades because they do those as well.  The bottom line for me was pricing, but what I got out of it (besides better price) was better quality AND they measured and installed everything.  I didn't even have to lift a finger!  All I had to do was write a check, which again, was a TON cheaper then me having to do it myself at Home Depot.  I can fully recommend these guys to any of my Yelp friends, or anyone who may find this review.  They were quick, courteous, and took care of everything, you should give them a shot if you are in the market for blinds here in Arizona!

So glad a Famous Dave's opening up near me.  I have been waiting for this one for a while.  I blame going here on Man vs Food where he was taking on some BBQ from Texas.  Anyway, I had the beef brisket & Chopped Pork.  They bring it with Corn on the Cob & Cornbread.  My two sides (as if al that were not enough) were the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  Really good meal, but word of advice - if a kid is scared of the dude (or gal) in the pig suit, leave them alone - they are scared of you and Daddy just may get up and punch you in the snout if you make his kid scream one more time.  Just my .02 though.  I can't wait to continue to go here and enjoy being a "meatavor"  Service was great and prices are always reasonable.  Portions are more than enough and again, my only complaint is the annoying person in the pig suit making my kid scream.  It may be fun for YOU, but not ME!

Not a fan of this place at all. Horrible tasting beef and pork. Every time I have ate at this place I have gotten sick. No going back for me.  I know there are a ton of peeps on here that love it, but I guess its all just a matter of preference.  I have not been happy and am not a fan at all!  I have given them many opportunities too.

So, sadly I have had to take my little guy 2 times now to Dr. Brooks for stitches.  What can I say?  He's a boy, and plays hard.  The first time was on his forehead (visible to all) and they did such a good job (a year later now) you can't even see where he split it open.  We took care of it, per their suggestions, but still they did such a great job.  The second time was on the chin and I am hoping it heals up a nicely too, but at least it's not very easy to notice.  Anyway, good staff, friendly and Dr. Brooks is just an awesome guy.  a little over $400 bucks for urgent care and stitches seems a bit high and it sucks to pay out of pocket when you are self employed, but oh well!!!!

Ice cream scoopers are kinda rude sometimes, but awesome ice cream.  This is the franchise I would always go to as a kid so I love it for that, but my main reason for leaving this review is to get the owner to smack the crew into gear and stop being rude.

I grew up in Silver City New Mexico and grew up with a certain kind of Mexican Food taste ... this place NAILS IT.  I love anything green chile on their menu.  The tacos and enchiladas (love the flavor of their red sauce) are amazing too, and more recently I had their red chile plate which because a favorite.  Anything and everything I have had here is amazing.  I love their beans and rice too ... Not much of a kids menu if your kids don't like Mexican food, but they do have cheese crisps for them (just no chicken nuggets or grilled cheese like some other Mexican kids menus do)   Anyway - this place is in my top 2 of go to Mexican Food spots in the East Valley (QC, Gilbert, Mesa etc)  Do yourself a favor and EAT HERE - you will be sending me a compliment thanking me later.

I highly, and I mean HIGHLY recommend the Ribeye dinner they have on their menu.  It is so huge, much bigger than I thought it would be.  Reasonable pricing too.  The service really was some of the best service that I have ever had while eating out.  Everything on the menu looks great and I just wish I lived closer to Scottsdale so I could try more on the menu.  I guess it will just have to come with time and when I have more meetings in that area!!  Everybody loved what they had (we had a decent sized group) and I heard amazing comments with zero complaints!  I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back, but seriously - TRY THE RIBEYE here!  so freaking yummy

It was 8 days old when I went, so of course it was crazy in there.  With that said, they did their best at service and it was pretty decent considering.  Food was good for Olive Garden food and we will probably be back - especially since there are not many options out here in the sticks....still, if you are looking for GREAT Italian food out here, head to Baci's.

I can't put into words how much I love this place. The lettuce wraps are awesome and my favorite dish by far is the Garlic chicken. They use to have a mango chicken dish that I loved but no longer do. I wish they would bring it back but I love them so much they still get 5 stars.

I was driving down San Tan Blvd. on my way to "The Deli" & I saw this new spot open in a brand new building that had just gone up.  I decided to give it a try because I love new local spots, given our limited number of choices out here in the QC.  I also love to support local small mom & pop businesses like this.  The 5 stars is for the pizza I had.  The owners are native to Chicago, so they know pizza right?  YES, they do.  It was not typical Chicago style with thick crust, but it was a pretty good mix of thin crust & thick - pizzaria style - my favorite.  I really did enjoy the sauce, the crust - everything about it.    I had a good chat with the owner too, and they are awesome people ... good service.  They are still working on the look inside, but have some great ideas in getting the local community involved (kids bringing their own sports pictures in and putting them on the wall etc.)  Sounds fun - my kids already have been begging!    They serve BBQ stuff (pulled pork etc. Gyros, pasta, salads - my wife had a salad she loved) lots of choices for everybody and the kids loved all their choices.   Anyway - I can't wait to go back and give some other stuff a try.

5 stars if the wait wasn't so long, and if they weren't so unorganized ..., but this is a place that has some really good food. I guess just one chef & he's the only one that knows the recipes. Way good red chilie. It's on the hot side if you like that (and I do).   It looks like a house, but it's a restaurant ... Trust me. Lots of seating outside, not much inside.  Not much options for kids so keep that in mind, and the menu is not big, but it really is good.

Meh ... seriously meh.  I tried it for the first time on a saturday night around 7 PM ... first clue should have been the lack of people eating at such a prime dinner time.  I tested a lot of the different dishes (honey chicken, sesame chicken with no sesame lol, noodles etc) and just wasn't that pleased with the taste & quality.  I did like the crab puffs though.   I don't know if we got the chef after it being a long day, but I probably won't be going back to this place.

Beware ... this is not a place your wife can just go into "for a minute" You are stuck for at least and hour (if you are lucky) Don't get me wrong its an amazing store (if you are a woman) but don't go there expecting to get out quickly (if you are a man)   This place has any and every kind of decoration possible - prices are good.  I have been to similar stores (even reviewed similar stores) and these prices are a TON better compared.    If you are needing to decorate your home - check it out.  And Yes, they have way much more than just rod and iron works stuff.  Awesome place.

I love how close I am to this place.  We are in Phoenix .. most of the time it is hot as hell here, so having a nice indoor training facility like this is pure AWESOME.  Prices are very reasonable too.  I remember paying 1.50 for 10 pitches back in the day, when you can get non stop pitches for 30 min for 24 bucks here.  They also have other packages too that might end up being cheaper if you do batting cages A LOT.  They have loyalty cards too, where you can get some free time in after so many visits.  I highly recommend this place.   The owners are passionate about baseball.  You can see it everywhere in this place.  They are nice, and very helpful.  If you don't own bats or helmets or anything its ok - they have anything and everything you might need.  They also have clinics on certain days - make sure and call and see when they are.  Lots of willing people to help all the time.

I hate hiring people for stuff I don't know anything about.  It could be $1 problem, or it really could be that $1,000 problem they are trying to tell me it is.  Either way, I'd have no clue.  This is how I felt forever with my air conditioning unit.  I went through 2 other companies until I found Chris Cole, owner of CFR Mechanical.  Found out from Chris that both the other companies were trying to take me for all they could.  Chris is an honest man and he explains exactly what is wrong with your AC UNITs and what isn't.  He also shared some tricks that competitors do to your Units to keep coming back year after year.    I will use CFR Mechanical & Chris for all my HVAC and electrical needs from now on.  He is honest, on time and does what he says he's gonna do.  Also very affordable.

NO STARS. Do not switch to Sprint. They lie about everything. EVERYTHING. The coverage is NOT what the map says in store or online. It's absolute GARBAGE and the lady that sold us is ZERO help.   Basically this is how it went:  Us: This phone doesn't work anywhere in Queen Creek  Sprint: Sucks to be you, but at least we got your money suckers.   We are switching back to Verizon. That whole cut your bill in 1/2 was a load of garbage too. Absolute joke. I will never do business with Sprint again. Ever. I think it would have been less painful to stab myself in the eye than what I went through today.   Uhhhhggg. STAY AWAY FROM SPRINT. If I even just get through to ONE of you I'll feel accomplished.

Never heard of firehouse subs before they got here to Queen Creek, but I am now a raving fan.  I have to be honest, I can't get myself to try anything other than the smoked brisket and cheddar sub ... it's just too damn good to stray.  I like how they give the kids lots of options and give them free fireman hats - kids love that and it makes for a good time, but I digress ... back to the business at hand.  The brisket is melt in your mouth good and the BBQ sauce is perfect combo of sweet and tangy.  I absolutely put this sandwich on my top 5 of all time.  TRY IT!!

The green chile chimi is by far my favorite thing here.  The salsa is a work in progress and they are asking for feedback to make it better (which hat tip to them for doing so and listening to their customer)  The drive thru is a little slow, and when I got home I got a Fajita chimi when I ordered a Green Chile one, but I will not slam them for that here - would be stupid since the food is so good, my only suggestion would be to make sure and not turn into a McDonalds where every drive thru order is wrong - maybe double check and go over again with person while in car?  Who knows, but I would suggest giving this place a try .. really good so far based on what I have had.

I usually don't like Pizza hut pizza, but today my son wanted pizza and since R&R shut down (like everything else in Queen Creek, or un-incorporated Pinal County as they like to call it)  we made our way to this Pizza Hut.  I must say the Pizza was yummy, and the service was top notch.  It was sad for lunch time, and I am talking right in the middle of lunch time (12:30) it was dead ... the only other people in the place were some people interviewing for a job there.  I had to laugh at that too because when I walked by the question was "how are you with a fast pace working environment?"  I thought not much fast paced about this Pizza Hut.  Anyway I hope they are able to stay in business.  The service was really good, and the lady went above and beyond to make me and my boys happy (and they are loud).    The dessert pizza was good, they had a good selection at the buffet and even brought me the kind of pizza I asked for when it was ready.  How about that for service....its a buffet, but I still didn't have to serve myself....ha.

One star for the raw chicken they served me. Nice Pizza Hut.  My bad for going here I guess.  Hope I don't get sick from it.  I take back any good experience I may have had with them because of this.     They did take 50% off the meal, but I was so grossed out it was hard to eat anything else and I think if you get served RAW CHICKEN you should be comped the entire meal.  Sounds fair to me.

I Love paradise bakerys roasted chicken ceaser salad and tomato soup!  I could eat them everyday for lunch AND dinner and never get tired of it.  I have tried to do better and not eat so much bread, so I am glad I found this here because normally I would CHOW DOWN on the paradise club - talk about an amazing sandwich!!!!

For what I got served (Chicken Parm) this is 0 stars, but I am giving it a 2 because whatever pasta dish my wife got was pretty good and saved this place from a horrible review.  Still, if you are in Vegas - go to Maggiano's if you are looking for Italian food, you will not be let down like I was here.  Also, the other reason I gave it two stars was because the dessert was pretty good (but I have experienced better) and that sums it up.

Love this place. It's a little closer to me than the Deli, so I'll probably end up coming here more often. I always get the salads. They are fresh and crisp. Kids love the other foods. Their menu is expanding too. Sandwiches & flatbreads & breakfast foods. Yummy!

Great food. Great service. Owner is a nice lady. They have a great selection. My wife had the hamburger and I had the chicken burger. You basically build your own burger. Lots of kid options too. It did take a little time to come out, but it was worth the wait. The onion rings were great too. Friendly waitresses too. I'll be back. They allow pets. The horses can come ride up. They have water for animals too.

Where do I even begin? This is going to be my new favorite spot, how about there? We had the cheddar ale soup. We had the tri-tip chili. Had several of the sandwiches. (We got several and shared). The Cuban was great. The Pizza looked great. They have a barista that is amazing. They have a salted caramel brownie that I named crack. Wow. I can't wait to go back and try more. One thing that I love is they have a ton of different bottled sodas to choose from too. The candied bacon cream soda was my favorite. For Reals. It's good. If you are looking for some great BBQ. Some great sandwiches. Soups, chilies. Desserts. Whatever.  They have it. It's a place I will keep visiting. I'm posting several pics too so you can see but this place is better than 5 starts. If you live anywhere near Chandler GO NOW!!!

Just opened and I really hope the locals help this place survive because I just had the chicken tacos and they were amazing. The best I've had in all of Queen Creek and they do their hard shells right. They make them. None of this pre made shell crap you find and some other local spots. The guacamole was fantastic, and the salsa was "ok" (not the best I've had) but I do like he homemade chips. They have a kids menu too and looks like a full bar (I don't drink so I'll be useless for info on that) but it looked pretty stocked. I will be making this a regular spot. This location seems to have a curse so Queen Creek let's help break that curse and help this new spot thrive. My wife had the steak tacos and said they were very good. So far so good. Can't wait to go back!!! I posted some pics of the food too.

Dr. Cheng is the best Doc in the whole Queen Creek area.  He's funny, he listens to you, and takes his time.  He does meet with a lot of patients but it always feels he's taking the time for you.  I love that when I have an appointment with him, I get right in (no waiting) and NO I am not kidding.  This seriously is the best Doctors office that I have been to in this area and all of Arizona.  If you live in the Queen Creek/Gilbert area and looking for a good family Doc.  This is the place.
