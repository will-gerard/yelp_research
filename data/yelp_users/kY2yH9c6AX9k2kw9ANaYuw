I had a great experience here. Very fast and friendly staff. Clearly a local business that cares about customers. Tempe was in dire need of a new oil change station and Stinky's is a welcome addition.

Yes, this is a local institution and a place to get costumes year-round. And yes, the customer service is terrible. Not sure why it's self-deemed a "fun shop" with grumpy, rude employees who are be better suited for work at the Maricopa County Jail. With sub-culture costuming bubbling up to pop culture status, a competitor offering a more welcoming experience could give this high margin business a run for their money. Until then, there's always the internet, or better yet, just make your own stuff.

This company came to my house to fix my sink and water heater today. The water heater's heating element breaker was going out so the tech replaced it. I flipped the outside breaker off for him as a courtesy at the panel and let him know I did so. After the installation, he told me his voltage reader was not getting a reading and that my breaker was broken. This seemed odd to me as this was never the problem but rather the issue stemmed from the heater itself.   He then proceeded to attempt to snake out my sink which was backed up. He could not clear the clog, which to his credit, is probably further down the line. Even though he had snaking equipment on him, he would not attempt to clear the line from either the laundry or on the roof vent line or on my dump line outside.   So, five hours and $65 later both the water heater and the sink are the same as they were before Alan S Plumbing showed up. I adjusted my work schedule in hope that I could get things fixed and get dinner going for my gal who is 11 months pregnant who was also returning from work.  Here's the kicker - after Alan Plumbing left i went to the breaker on my circuit box - it was off! He'd never bothered to trip the breaker. So I did. Now at least we'll have hot water tonight, but snaking the line caused my laundry line to overflow, so I've got a real mess on my hands now.  There's something about the quality of service you get from a company that works exclusively with Home Warranty companies whose job is to take your money and refuse as many services as possible ("We don't do electricity.." "I'm not authorized to...").  I've noticed a lot of people on Yelp reviews getting screwed by both Alan S and Fidelity Home Warranty Company so I'm going to be sure and reach out to my realtor and let her know about my experience.  UPDATE: We hired another company to clean up after Alan S's snaking SNAFU today. They fixed the problem in about 5 min. The heating element breaker i mentioned is now not working again, so I basically have the same problem as before I called Alan S. DO NOT USE THIS PLUMBER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

These guys came out to my house today and saved us from the dispatched home warranty mess left behind by another company. They did a very thorough job and made sure our drain clog was clear. Highly recommend.

This is a great little place to grab sushi for lunch. The staff are friendly and the prices are fair. A great alternative to the typical lunch fair.

I work in Downtown Phoenix have lunched here several times. When it first opened, the service was good but as of late it has fallen off. Yesterday I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and no one came out from the back to take my order so I left and ate someplace else.

Visited this place last night. I love supporting local businesses and these folks have decent pizza. I called ahead about an hour and the pie was fresh and hot when I got there from work. I'll be back!
