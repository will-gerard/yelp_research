After eating the burger and fries I quickly decided this place will be a regular for us... Love that it's a dive bar as well .. Warning ! The burgers are very greasy but so worth it ! And the buns are grilled with a little grease too :) I usually don't eat my buns but at this place I did and will.  I'm not hungover but this is prob a really good hangover burger too !!

The food for a Taco Shop is Ok... I got 3 bean and cheese burritos for almost 16$ That's pretty dam pricey if u ask me. I didn't look at the price when ordering so shame on me , but when I got to the window and she took my $ I then asked how much burritos were she said 4.48$ each , shocked and stunned at the price still I didn't have time to do the math in my head , I get my food .. Confused , I pull over to see the menu and BEAN Burritos are 3.15$ cheese is .95 so that equals 4.10$ .. Where did she get 4.48$ ?? And how did it end up 16$ ?!?!  Long story short , BEAN and CHEESE burritos are not on the menu , cheese is a extra cost.  The burrito it's self isn't bad and isn't the best ... Bottom line - do the math before u order cause they don't . I will not be going there again , I can get way better 5$ bean and cheese somewhere else !

Tried this place cause close to home and good yelp reviews... Hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix , but this place was pretty good .. Good addicting salsa , I got the 3 enchiladas platter , which were all good , good sauces, good rice and beans ... No funny flavors. Good happy hour, friendly service  :) good all around :)  I would def come back here when I'm craving Mexican close to home.

This place is just ok , not the worst divey place I've eaten at but not the best .. The wings are pretty good .. Fried Zuchinni not bad. We also ordered a calzon , no flavor .. Tasted like can and jar ingredients and was cold on the inside .. Asked her to re-heat it and still came back cold.. So we just had it boxed and I will put in the oven when we get home ! Staff seemed friendly , although no one seemed over 16 years old :-/

Dropped in for lunch and what a little hidden gem ! Menu outside got our YES to come in .. So many delicious sounding choices was hard to choose from ! Open the door and what cute decor , I was expecting like a taco shop feel or sandwich shop but it's a cute little restaurant hole in the wall place :)  (which I love). We got the fresca pita and world famous with spicy feta fries , so good you just can't stop eating no matter how full you are ! Flavor is good , all the meat is fresh , chicken in mine was all white meat :) no fatty gross pieces . We will def be back !

This place is great ! Affordable to maintain your nails , clean , fast and most importantly nails come out amazing ! I went in originally wanting to add tips but she talked me into just getting gels (cheaper) since I have nice nails to begin with  ... My nails turned out amazing ! Better than when I've gone to super fancy expensive places !! I think my techs name was Mai ?? I won't go anywhere else from now on :)

The worst guest service ever .. Stood waiting to look at sunglasses for 16 minutes while the lady helped someone else without even acknowledging me .. Not even "I'll be right with you" .. Someone from a completely different department came over to help me .. She seemed like she was high and had no idea how to do a simple return , so she called over a "manger" who also had no clue what was going on ....kept looking at the employee to tell me what was gonna happen , couldn't even look me in the face . I had to go upstairs to customer service to have them do it and even they were confused how to return the cash I paid and the rest back on my card . I'm sure I'm not the only person to have ever paid 1/2 cash and 1/2 credit . Not rocket science . So what should have been a simple return took an hour of my time .

We order these breakfast burritos to the office ALL THE TIME ! They are the best in town ! I'm not normally a breakfast eater but I sure eat these ! Flavorful , good soft crispy thin flour tortillas , excellent salsa .. And the delivery guy is always nice and smiley. They're all good but my fav is the Max Bacon ... Mmmm mmmmm good !

Great place ! Food was great , exactly what I expected , we were already planning what we would order on our next visit !! .. Prices are decent and you leave stuffed !! Be prepared to be in a food coma afterwards . Friendly staff . The place is always packed , line out the door most of the time so my tip would be to arrive a little earlier than you'd like .

This place is disgusting ..went here starving and left starving ! Couldn't bare to eat food that looked unappetizing , we got the teriyaki bowls .. Veggies were soggy and looked microwaved , they were a dull color , kinda rubbery too. Meat looked like thawed frozen chicken (not fresh) rice was drenched in sauce. Place was dingy inside , not very clean .. I don't expect much from fast food places but when your starving and STILL can't bring yourself to eat the food that's a bad sign (usually everything looks and taste better ! )  just gross all the way around. If you want a yummy chicken bowl go to Yogis ! They r delish and fresh !! ;)

The most authentic place for that South West Mex flavor in AZ that I've had by far ! You can def distinguish the flavors ! Food melts in your mouth , Spicy I might add but good ... Some dishes even come with the sopapillas for desert .. If you can find a plate that comes with them , I highly recommend getting it .. So good ! Cozy little restaurant with that old school authentic feel .

Excellent all around... Loved the old school atmosphere , seated right away (was Mother's Day) nice friendly service ... Texas Margarita was SO good (just wish it was bigger) Finally , BEST Mexican food I've had since moving here from SD .. Big portion (I coulda shared) .. When we got the check I even got a rose for Mother's Day :) the only reason for 4 star is I think the Margaritas could be bigger. Otherwise it's a great place and I WILL be back.

Wow ! Stumbled across this place and so glad I did ! So so good , service is friendly . He asked if this was our 1st time and offered samples ! Food arrived and to our surprise you even get a free cookie . Food was DELISH ! Jerk rice was amazing , quesadilla with Machaca meat is the way to go ;) and to top it off with a cherry on top I found out this is one of the spots Guy  Fieri stopped at on his show..(I had no clue and I love him) .  We will def be back !!

Awesome little hidden (literally) place ... If your trying to find this place just know there is literally no sign .. Just look for black doors with a sign saying "free kittens will be given to misbehaved children" !  The food is great , full of flavor , so filling ! Can be a little pricey so be prepared . Love the dark atmosphere .. Great for date night :)

This is probably one of my favorite "fast food" places ... Lots of organic choices , I believe the salad bar is gluten free. Everything is fresh and pretty healthy if your looking for fast healthy lunch option. I've had a few wraps , all good. The soups are delish :) .. And love the salad bar !    I always get the Manager special 1/2 sandwich with fruit instead of chips and side salad (which is full access to salad bar) and I'm absolutely stuffed ! You can also go back to salad bar as much as you want . Then you get free soft serve yogurt for dessert ! And to top that off they will give u a to go cup for your soda if u want !!

Descent food, nothing to special or great about it... Had a "lunch special" sign out front for 1 or 2 slices of pizza and soda for 4.50$ or 6.50$ but once inside she said they had no individual slices , just whole pizzas. Ok, so maybe bring the sign in ?????? I'm not a cheapskate but 16.95 for a 12" pepperoni pizza is pricey. If I'm gonna pay that much I'm gonna go to a REAL Italian fine dinning restaurant. Friendly but SLOW service as well.

Just moved here from San Diego and never went to the movies , never thought 25$ was worth seeing any movie, and that's not including drinks or snacks.. The prices here are totally reasonable , matinee prices till 6pm ! You can buy a loyalty cup for 5$ and get refills for a buck fifty !  Also if u get a loyalty shirt you get a medium popcorn everytime , u can upgrade to a large for only 1$ and then bring the bag back next time for a FREE Popcorn !!!!   Needless to say we see All The movies now all the time !

Love Arrowhead location, But this scottsdale location I do not care for at all..... The room i was in was VERY small ( compared to arrowhead ) , upon arriving everyone was very chatty and loud, WAY OVER CROWDED !! about 4 inches between my matt and the person next to me,...certain poses, the persons rear end was no more than an inch from my face (very awkward) phones not put on silent .. Im a newbie at this and purchased a groupon, Im so glad I tried the other location 1st and not this one or i would have never returned, I wish i didnt waste a class at this location. Im giving 2 stars because the Instructor John S. was amazing (wish he taught at the other one) otherwise I'd give 1 star.  My personal tip for newbies is to go to the other location, even if it is out of your way... Nicer studio, bigger room, quiet and more mature group of attendees :)

Since moving to phoenix this is the BEST donut shop I've found ! Don't even bother with Krispy Kreme or Dunkin donuts..  The staff is friendly and smiley , Nice and clean on the inside .. Nice display of FRESH donuts ... Lots of choices and flavors .. They even have a double chocolate donut ! The donut it's self it's nice and airy , not OVERLY sweet , just the right amount of sugar and glaze ;) there's plenty of tables to eat in and a  drive through.  Yum yum yum !!!

I've only come here for lunch and never been disappointed . Friendly service , great food and they even give you a to go drink when your all done :) .. I always get the lunch special with slice of pizza and salad which includes a drink (about $11.50) .. You have the option of gluten free slices and the organic salads are fresh and delish.. This is also the 1st place I've seen with Himalayan pink sea salt at the table ;)  If your looking for a healthy lunch choice this is the place to try ;)

Was excited to try this place as I am a Toby fan ... Cool atmosphere , BUT slow slow slow service . Don't go in starving !! We waited 40 minutes to get our food , nothing special ... 3 burgers and a grilled cheese and fries.  The food was descent , not great enough to go back though.  I can now say "been there done that" .

Nice place , You MUST try the onion rings ! Only 3$ and SO good !!! Place was pretty busy (which we expected for a beautiful day in March) about 30 minute wait but it's worth it .. Friendly fast service , everything we ordered was good , watching others food walk by looked all good .. I feel like I could have sat there for hours just watching people and boats go by and soaking up the fresh air and sunshine :)

Had my 1st ever injection of Dysport here, my fore head was like a shar-pei ! I didn't think it was fixable ... Had the injections done and after just a couple hours I could already see a difference. I was already happy with results but after a few days my forehead is completely smooth !! I'm beyond happy with my results ! Dr. Newman and entire staff were very nice, the actual injections didn't hurt at all , no bruising like I've read about. I will def be going back for more when needed :)

Best service by far I have EVER received ! The staff is very attentive , professional and yet friendly . Atmosphere is upscale, dark and awesome music.. The food is beyond amazing , full of flavor and cooked to perfection . They constantly make sure you have beverage , crumbs wiped off the table and clean napkins at all times . They thought we waited to long for our appetizer and brought a free beignet donut tree after our dinner ! But before the donut tree they brought us hot wet towels to clean our hands . There isn't 1 negative thing about this place !

Awesome little place ! I had the Big Wac and was shocked of how much it actually tasted like a burger ! Also , their their organic teas , black currant and lime juices are very good in the big self serve containers ( dont expect to get soda here) .. I wish I could eat here everyday ! The menu seems so creative , will definitely be back to try more items !

Went here out of convince (shopping in the area and starving)  we had the teriyaki bowls and were very pleased .. Nice clean cut chicken (we upgraded to white meat) just enough sauce to where it didn't make the rice soggy , fresh rice (kinda sticky , just how I like) next time I'll try the same thing with veggies though. To top it off , The lady working was very friendly :) we will def be back!

The juices are amazing here ! So good I could drink them all day everyday , but unfortunately I can't ... The only down side is they are pretty pricey , 10$ a juice. So if u wanna do a cleanse prepare for a good chunk of $$ to be spent :(  I'd give 5 stars if they were a little more affordable for a daily basis.

One of the BEST places I've eaten at since moving to AZ !! Smells good walking in , so many good choices on the menu .. We got the bacon board , turkey leg , brisket sandwich and salmon entree , omg they were all so mouth watering good ! Excellent flavors , paired with garnishes that I would have never tried and so glad I did ! Bacon that melts in your mouth ! Anyone who goes must start with a bacon board ! Oh and our drinks were stiff and good size :) .. Good service and ambiance . Will be back for sure !

This place is Pho-King great !! If you love and live for pho like I do then you must give this place a try ! Fast seating , fast friendly service , fresh ingredients, clean atmosphere .. The pho was so delicious I wanted to go back for dinner !  I got the dine in special , for 10$ you get a bowl of pho , plate of ingredients to throw in , spring roll or egg roll and a soda .. Now that's a great deal ! I will be back , probably in a couple days haha !

I found this place on groupon and can honestly say this is THE BEST groupon purchase yet!!!! The hosts are so energetic and upbeat you cant help but smile and laugh the whole time...Great fun music that you know all the words to (whether you want to admit it or not)... sure to get you moving in your seat and around the room :) Even if your not an "Artist" you will be able to paint what ever your theme is for the night. And having a bottle of wine next to you is the best part ! Fun for the whole family! We will Def be back !!  Personal tip* bring extra bottle of wine :)

So glad I gave this little place a try , friendly staff , clean , good prices and most of all excellent nail results ! My nail tech was Tammy and she did exactly what I asked for .. I have acrylic with gel and I asked to Make them as thin as she could and she did (most places I still leave with thick "pillow" nails) .. My nails look fantastic and thin  , I left more than happy and will be coming back in a couple weeks .

I'm not a big BBQ fan but willing to try it to see if I can develop a taste for it .... This place was pretty dang good in my opinion .. All the meat was tender , not dry like some I've tried... I usually don't like BBQ sauce so even if you don't dip it in sauce it's still good . Not dry or flavorless. ALL the sides were good , couldn't stop nibbling at everything. Cool divey kinda bikerish atmosphere (which we love) .. And there's even a bar ;)

Everything I've had on the menu has been really good , quite addicting , especially when you work 1 minute away ! Everything is fresh , clean establishment ...the wait for your order can be long at times so I've learned to order and pay on line , then it's ready when I get there . It would also be nice if they had a loyalty punch card for frequent customers .

WORST WALMART EVER ! Complete morons that work here ... I've had a few prescriptions filled here and each time I've dealt with a moron cashier , moron "pharmacist" .. Be prepared to wait an hour. Today was told they were in the middle of filling a prescription , 45 minutes later still not filled , supposedly put a "critical" on it this time .. 25 minutes later finally filled ! Guy at register smells like booze. I have no idea how they made it through pharmaceutical  school , let alone get a job.  Not to mention this is a super GHETTO walmart , witnessed a thief trading in her loot for drugs in the parking lot .  This walmart is convenient , that's the only reason for coming 3 times .. BUT NEVER AGAIN.
