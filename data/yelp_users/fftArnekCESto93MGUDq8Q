If you care at all about customer service and being treated respectfully, DO NOT COME HERE. We had a VERY unpleasant experience (leaving this anonymous out of legitimate fear of retaliation in a physical form from them). DO NOT COME HERE. They are unprofessional, pushy, aggressive and straight up harassing. Yelp is welcome to PERSONALLY CALL ME if they want more details of what happened.

I have been growing my hair out for the last two years and avoiding highlighting it. It's become a grown out ombre so I finally decided to get it balayaged. A friend recommended the Waverly and Patty had an opening. I am so glad I went because Patty is a true balayage artist! My hair looks so sun kissed and natural. She blended my old grown out highlights into my natural dirty blonde roots. She also used conditioner to protect  my hair at the roots and did a perfect tone. I will be returning to Patty for now on!

I have an iPhone with Verizon and pay for insurance. The one time in 6 years where I actually need to use my insurance because of a shattered screen and they say it will be $200... Pretty ridiculous since I pay $10 a month for insurance. On top of that you're getting a new phone so you have to transfer all of your information which sucks.   So I found Telepark and for $120 and 20 minutes of my time they put a new screen on it. It's like new, the only change is that the color isn't quite the same. Not quite the high def of the old screen but for the price and convenience, I don't mind :)
