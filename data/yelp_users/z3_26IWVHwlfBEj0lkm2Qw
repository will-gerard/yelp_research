I just got a to go calzone to bring it home and find canned, sour mushrooms in it. It is absolutely mind boggling to me that a restaurant uses canned mushrooms for anything these days, especially as a topping for pizza, calzones, etc. Nothing appetizing whatsoever about this. Plus, my immediate thought after is "what else are you trying to save a penny on?" Take pride in your food. You're a restaurant. Its ALL YOU HAVE.

Rude "Captain" !!! She was very irritated that we sat at a table that wasn't cleaned yet. When she did come over, she wiped the table, made a rude comment telling my boyfriend that if he would move his keys, she could clean our table and left us with a wet table. She was miserable. She never returned to see how we were doing. In fact,  she did the opposite. She avoided us the entire time, had a sour look on her face every time she passed our table. I dont know why we ever come here. I'm never impressed. Used up our gift card. Won't be coming back.

Food is usually pretty good but holy moly the floor in this building is so gross. Its dirty, stained, musty, smelly carpet. I'd be willing to bet that if the owners put new flooring in, the place would not only look and SMELL better, but business would pick up...and maybe they wouldn't have 2.5 out of 5 stars...just saying. Also, the weird little musty room that you walk into before you enter the restaurant needs something. And needs to not smell like that.

This store fails EVERY TIME. OMG. I have a good sized family. 4 children 2 adults.... Never fails. Every time I get home, I'm missing a bunch of stuff. When you spend $25-$30 at Taco Bell, you expect to at least get what you paid for. Disappointing. I even tell them at the window to double check. It can't be that friggin hard.

I love love love this salon. I've been going here for years. Tina is great. Very patient, always takes her time with you, never rushing you to get someone else in her seat. She does awesome nail art too. She really cares about her clients. I've read some I'd these reviews and some of these situations may be a little exaggerated or maybe it was just an off day. Everybody has them. I would absolutely recommend thus salon to anyone and everyone. Its clean, professional, and reasonably priced.

Let me start out by saying, I've been in the food and beverage/ hospitality industry for a long time now so I understand how things work. This review comes from my FOURTH visit. I know people have bad days. Restaurants have bad days. I really tried to like this place. I love sushi, love the concept....  With that being said...the sushi is just NOT FRESH. I've been in there for lunch and dinner now. Each time, me and my company were literally the only people in the joint. The fish was discolored, skimpy, mostly rice, and simply not appetizing at all. My husband told me to grab a Philly roll. I took it off the belt, uncovered it. He put one in his mouth and got this horrifying look on his face. He insisted that I try it. I said no! Lol why would I do that if its bad. I finally agreed. I tried it. It was rancid. Not good at all. I literally gagged. It tasted like cloves and bad fish. I wouldn't even swallow it. It had such a strong rotten taste to it. Hard to even explain. This is coming from someone who loves blue cheese and strong, flavorful foods. I couldn't believe they were serving this. Then we tried this other roll. Dont remember the name. No luck with that one either. My husband said it taste like something out of the garbage disposal and IT DID. Even the color. I'm not kidding.   Anyways, the building is cool. Very clean, maybe because there's nobody going in to dirty it. The ambiance is nice. Its really too bad the quality doesnt match the appearance and location. I'll be surprised if this place makes it another few months. Really disappointed.

Food was amazing. Service was good, will get better. They are still working out the kinks, of course. That is expected with any new restaurant. I hope people read this before writing a crappy review. THIS IS A NEW LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS! SUPPORT IT! Have patience. Dont expect it to be perfect the first time. If you know that you're not a patient person, wait 6-9 months before even walking inside. If you like craft beer and good quality food, this is a great place. If you want Coors Light and a cheap burger, go toTailgater's. Lol DB  We will be back!!!!
