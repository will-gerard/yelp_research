M'Lynne is an amazing server! The prior week my boyfriend and I had poor service making us hesitant to return. Tonight the dining room, were we originally wanted to sit, was slammed. M'Lynne prompted us to sit in the bar area and took amazing care of us. They didn't have the Amber Ale my boyfriend wanted but she was quick to lighten the mood with jokes. Smart, quick-witted, and funny. Will be back for sure!

Brock was amazing. I know beer so I'm always impressed when a server can match my descriptions to one of their drafts. I told him I like oatmeal stouts and chocolate porters and he steered me in the right direction immediately. Amazing food and even better beer. I'll be back and to see him for sure.

I have had nothing but problems. Management is rude and slow to remedy situations. I even reached out to Peak Campus, the parent company, in regards to a discussion with Anthony, the holier than thou manager, and have yet to receive a response over a month later. Water was out for 4 days with no courtesy email to residents. I spent those days staying at a friends, so that was an inconvenience to say the least. Parking is limited and Vertex went as far as to refuse my boyfriend parking with no issue of notice to me. I can't wait for to move out and for the staff to move on. (Only reason this isn't a one star is because the closet is huge and security is amazing.)
