My 2 year old daughter has been attending this program at the Aviano location since she was 6 months of age.  She LOVES it!  She has made several friends in the class that she looks forward to seeing each week.  She has known some of these kids since she began the program at 6 months.  The other parents are wonderful.  My husband and I look forward to seeing them as well.  Teacher Kathy is TERRIFIC!  My husband and I appreciate her immensely and our daughter adores her so much!  My husband and I have really enjoyed watching our daughter's development with this program.  My daughter thoroughly enjoys the music, it's what we listen to whenever we are in the car.  When my daughter was younger, she would mimic the gestures that she saw during class when listening to the CD in the car.  These days, she sings along in full animation!  I have noticed other benefits that I believe this class has helped to facilitate; her language skills developed quickly as did her counting skills and color identification.  Music Together is fun for all ages and there are so many positive correlations for getting children involved in music at a young age.  I highly recommend this program.

Picazzo's was a favorite place to eat for my family until our most recent experience at the location on Cactus Rd.  We always get our food to go and I typically order the kale salad.  Much of my kale was fuzzy, looked completely unwashed and was visibly rotting in my salad.  I dumped my salad out, because there were just too many pieces of kale that were clearly rotting and when I did, I saw multiple bugs crawling around the to-go box.  The salad was one day old (not even 24 hours).  This experience may have caused me to lose my appetite for Picazzo's entirely, but for sure, my family will not be returning to this particular location.  I have posted photos as well.

Dr. Kanarish is superb!  He is a WONDERFUL, kind, sincere and compassionate human being and the very best veterinarian we have ever come across.  He has a stellar bedside manner and he really knows his stuff!   I cannot praise him enough.  He has gone above and beyond for our fur family time and again.  He has truly been amazing in every way.   He allows his patients to take all of the time they need for questions/ concerns and never makes his patients feel unimportant or rushed.  I have never met anyone so passionate about what they do and so compassionate with everyone who walks through the door, both people and animals.  He truly listens to and understands his clients and is sensitive to the needs and wishes of the families that he sees.   I am telling you, above and beyond!  I couldn't dream of better care.  He was wonderful to have by our side when my family had to say goodbye to our beloved Greyhound, Smiles.  His staff are all so kind and friendly.  The office is lovely, comfortable and clean.  I have always been appreciative and very pleased with the course of treatments for our fur family.  This is a fantastic place to take your fur family members.   You and your fur family will always receive the very best care at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital.  My family is so grateful to have found this office!  We have always had a positive experience with Dr. K and his staff.  I always highly recommend this office to friends.  My friends who have gone to this office on our recommendation have always been so pleased with the care they received.

I cannot recommend Dr. Martin enough!  She saved my daughter's life during labor.  I have a happy,  healthy, thriving 2 year old now.  Dr. Martin is incredibly calming and soothing, her voice, her demeanor, everything.  I never felt rushed in any of my appointments.  She took all the time I needed for questions and calmed me every step of the way during my pregnancy.  She was present at all of my appointments and is present at just about ALL of her patient's deliveries, which I found, is not often the case.  Many doctors work in teams and someone on the team is there.  I felt strongly about having a female doctor and Dr. Martin was perfect!  She was exactly what I needed during pregnancy and delivery.  Very knowledgeable, very kind and a superb OB!  I am so grateful that she cared for me during pregnancy and delivered my baby girl!  I highly recommend her.  Her office staff and nurse are wonderful as well!

Jaimi Dolmage is out-of-this-world awesome!  I recommend her constantly!  She has done my hair for several years now and every time I see her, I leave feeling refreshed and happy.  I have very fine hair and somehow, she manages to work wonders with it.  She truly listens to her clients wants and she is incredibly knowledgable and skilled.  In addition to being highly skilled, a good listener and understanding what her clients want, she has a fantastic personality and I always look forward to seeing her.  She is so easy to be with.  The salon is bright and beautiful with terrific views.  My haircut is always fabulous! Love, love, love Jaimi!  She is a gifted stylist!
