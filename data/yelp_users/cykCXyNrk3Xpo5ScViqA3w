WHat can I say about Carolina's?  It isn't pretty nor is it in the nicest part of town.  The service isn't particularly great and there is ALWAYS a line and a wait for your order.  The floors are bare and seating tight so you wonder why it gets four stars?  The answer is simple, the food is absolutely spot on!    There are about a half dozen elderly Mexican women making fresh tortillas at any one time, the kitchen though sparse, turns out food you can't wait to eat and everyone dining seems happy with what is in from of them regardless of having to bump elbows with your neighbors at times.  One of my pre-travel rituals is a red chile chimichanga combo, which comes with rice, bean and a side of shredded lettuce, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  Let me tell you this, they STUFF that freshly made tortilla with generously sized cubes of beef bathed in a delicious red chile sauce.  Refried beans may be refried beans but these just work, great consistency, texture exactly as it should be and taste "just like momma would make" (if momma was Mexican!)  I'm a fan of Carolinas and though you don't start to find "frills" in restaurants until you head several mies North or East, I make it a point to take visiting family or friends by to taste some of the best Phoenix has on offer.

So I've been going to Einstein Bros bagels for YEARS and have generally had what I would call "4 star" experiences.  The restaurants are always clean, the service prompt and friendly and the bagels (I almost always get a tasty turkey on a toasted everything bagel).  Yesterday, I dropped into this location hungry & ready for my usual.  The restaurant was PACKED, no biggie, I've seen this before, these guys are bagel slingin pros and will make short work of this line....  So, I step up to the order counter, look into the case & notice they're running low on some varieties but have what I'm looking for.  I order and make my way to the register.  This is where I notice they're set up kinda backwards.  You enter the queue on the left of the store, order and move to the right to pay.  The cashier is next to the restroom and drink machines (a dead end) but then you have to go BACK int the queue where people are ordering to GET your food... Not an issue if the store isn't busy but when all tables are occupied and there's a line to the door, it's kind of a mess.  Every minute or so, an name is called and a bagel lover gets his/her breakfast, everything's in order then right, well.... About every second name called seemed to result in the patron approaching the counter to get his/her order only to be told they'd run out of their bagel choice and would have to choose another.  After 15 minutes waiting for MY name to be called, the moment came and I stepped up to the counter and was told they didn't have any everything bagels and I would have to choose something else.  My response, you had plenty when I ordered, the response "well, we're out now and people are waiting behind you so hurry up and pick something else."  This kinda pissed me off so I looked at the case and said I'll have a garlic bagel, "if you have any left when you make my sandwich." Yes, I was snarky but so was the bagel maker.  The blonde girl next to him seemed offended that I would have anything to say about the goings on and stopped making sandwiches to make sarcastic comments to the guy who was making my bagel.    Anyway, 5min later I got my order and we headed home.  I opened my bag and inside was NOT a garlic bagel, it was NOT toasted but it WAS an okay onion bagel.    Maybe I'm overreacting but I don't feel like making bagels is THAT difficult nor do I think it's too much to crank up bagel production when you're slammed on a Saturday (5-11-13) morning....

A cool place to chill, relax with friends and have a drink or three on a Friday night but the food left a little bit to be desired. I Ordered the Fish Tacos (Being From Southern California I've eaten my share of both good and bad), when the arrived I noticed that the portion was good, the presentation was visually appealing with three tacos stacked atop mixed greens with a side of what LOOKED like mango salsa and a smal bucket of still warm, fresh cut potato chips. On 1st bit I noted that the texture was good, nice crunchy greens, warm soft tortillia and fish that....wait...where was the fish? There seemed to be a lack of fish, so I opened up all three and noticed that there was VERY little fish served with a GOOD bit of roughage and some sort of pinkish sauce that had the look and texture of 1000 Island dressing....Where was the Beloved white sauce and light, flaky fish that MAKES this dish a HIT? So If you are looking for a cool place to hang out and have a drink no problem, if your looking for tasty, authentic fish tacos...you've come to the wrong place. (I WILL say that the burgers, onion rings and hot wings LOOKED pretty damned authentic and tasty)

The menu was FULL of great choices, we settled on the war wonton soup (soggy noodles, VERY overcooked shrimp, sickly sweet broth), teriyaki chicken (bland, fatty & more skin than chicken), yang chow fried rice (greasy, very poor cuts of chicken & pork), and chicken fried rice (again, greasy and with lots of fatty chicken). The service wasn't very good and the pricing was more appropriate for a MUCH better meal.

How many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting, well reviewed or recommended restaurant, been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal?  Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes? Wanted to know what goes into getting food on your plate?  As an avid foodie this is something that is always on my mind so when Chef Sean Currid of Cafe ZuZu at Scottsdale, Arizona's Hotel Valley Ho invited me into his kitchen to observe Service firsthand, I jumped at the opportunity!  Cafe ZuZu, set in the historic Hotel Valley Ho on the Western edge of Old Town Scottsdale, is a hidden gem. Not only are the grounds nostalgic but the food is fantastic and the atmosphere relaxing.  I entered the kitchen towards the end of "Happy Hour," and got the grand tour from Chef Currid. One thing I noticed immediately was how small the dry storage and walk-in refrigerators were, indicating freshness of ingredients through rapid use.  In the kitchen, Chef Currid can be found on the line, sleeves rolled up, preparing dishes and directing his kitchen crew, care and experience ensuring every dish goes out true to concept.  What I was most interested in was the food and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint! Beginning with happy hour small plates priced at $3 each ($5-$6 is what I would have expected to pay for these delights), I ate my way thru Chef Currid's cuisine.  Chicken drumettes fried to a crisp, golden brown, lightly seasoned and served with bourbon honey dipping sauce got things started. These plump little chicken tasties were a pleasant break from the ubiquitous wing and paired with what can only be compared to liquid gold (honey bourbon sauce), are a must have!  Walking through the kitchen earlier I had noticed a HUGE herb crusted prime rib roast preparing to spend a few hours in a hot oven, this meat found it's way onto the next plate as a Prime Rib dip sandwich.  Shaved nearly paper thin, topped with melted cheese and placed atop a crusty baguette, complimented by a rich, flavorful jus and horseradish mayo, this sandwich delivered far in excess of $3 worth of flavor!  There's something about grilled cheese that's comforting but Cafe ZuZu takes it to a whole different level with their Artisan grilled cheese duo.  Crunchy, buttery sliced baguette topped with melted Brie cheese, crisp green apple and fig jam, these little jewels are absolutely packed with flavor, texture and are about the best thing to pass my lips in recent memory! (simple, elegant, perfect and at $3, the best deal in the Valley!)  No happy hour menu is complete without good bruschetta and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint. Bright red, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese are combined to make this classic, simple dish.  As happy hour ended, the first of the dinner appetizers went past my fork. Butternut squash ravioli ($10), followed by Prince Edward Island Mussels ($10)  The giant al dente ravioli stuffed with creamy butternut squash, topped with sauteéd diced squash, looked and tasted lovely! A quenelle of pumpkin cream melted into the dish providing the perfect accompaniment and a touch of micro greens for color an texture rounded this dish out nicely.  There aren't too many things better in my opinion, than a plate of mussels in a rich, savory broth. Paired with spicy Spanish chorizo, ZuZu's Prince Edward Island mussels, tomato and fennel are just devine! Did I mention the white wine and garlic broth?  As my time in Chef Currid's kitchen drew to a close (and the button on my jeans began to strain dangerously), the evenings featured dish found it's way in front of me and a fresh fork materialized in my hand.  Tender Sautéed beef tips, garlic roasted potatoes, roasted root vegetables including beets, parsnip and even a little Brussels sprout sneaked in (I'd never have believed this would be one of my favorite vegetables), all on a rich port wine reduction, perfectly executed and absolutely delicious. Find a rainy day, order this dish if it's available and prepare to be satisfied.  A roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole ($9.50) went by too fast for me to divert and get my fork into but from the looks of it and after having sampled the previous dishes, I'd bet it is worth a return visit.  All in all, my time as an observer in Chef Currid's kitchen at Cafe ZuZu was well spent. The cuisine is far beyond what you might expect of a typical "hotel restaurant," and absolutely worth investigating.  Whether you're looking for a generously priced happy hour delivering food far beyond expectation or a gourmet meal without pomp and circumstance, Cafe ZuZu delivers!

One of my favorite places to breakfast on the weekends in my hometown of San Diego is Hash House a Go-Go (or just plain Hash House to locals). Being in Las Vegas and knowing that Sin City has its very own Hash House (three in fact), there was no way I was going to miss a taste of home.  Arriving at a time that would cause a 45 to 90 minute wait at the San Diego location, I was surprised to be told that I would be seated in between 15 and 20 minutes. Happily taking my pager, I shuffled off to wait and in due course was buzzed.  Setting my sights on a "Campfire s'mores" mocha ($7) which arrived in an over-sized cup (visibly cracked as seen in the picture) topped with gooey, charred marshmallows, chocolate syrup and Graham crackers.  The first spoonful was thick with marshmallowy goodness and its smokey, crunchy crust brought me immediately back to childhood outings in the woods by the campfire, roasting s'mores with family and friends. If the coffee itself had been better, this mocha would have been perfect but it falls just short of the mark.  Having had many of the offerings on the standard menu over the years, I decided I'd order one of the brunch specials. The Nappanee hash ($14.95) with fresh tomatoes, green beans, marinated steak, smoked mozzarella and crispy potatoes was ordered and anticipated.  Things began going pear shaped when I asked my server If I could add fresh roasted corn (available in the other brunch offering), to my hash and was told "the Chef can't guarantee the flavor profile if changes are made so we don't allow substitutions or additions." FAIL!  In due course my server arrived clutching a medium sized cast iron skillet in a heavy oven mitt. What a great idea, the cast iron would keep my food hot and steamy while I enjoyed it...WRONG! The skillet seems to have been used solely for presentation and not preparation, it was stone cold and after a bite, I realized temperature of my meal was not far off. FAIL!  The "marinated steak" was a perfectly cooked medium but lacked flavor. The green beans, which I felt were a strange choice for a breakfast dish, were a bit too al dente and the whole skillet lacked seasoning.   Curiously, the server pointed out the days freshly made strawberry citrus jam and asked if I would like butter to go with it and my buttermilk biscuit to which I replied "yes," but somehow said butter never materialized. FAIL!  In all the meal was mediocre, there were several opportunities to meet or exceed expectations but none were taken advantage of.   The server could have noticed the large, clearly visible crack in my coffee mug,  If cast iron was to be used for presentation only, there's no reason it couldn't have been warmed so as to keep its contents at the desired temperature and  finally, when asked to add roasted corn to the dish, the server could have suggested i have it on the side instead of basically telling me the Chef understands my palate better than I do.  I have a warm place in my heart for Hash House a Go Go and have recommended breakfast/brunch there to many friends and acquaintances alike, I can only hope that this particular meal was an aberration.

I recently dropped by one of my favorite local, family owned and operated restaurants to warm my belly with delicious hot food.  Why do I emphasize the word hot here?  Well, This particular restaurant happens to be Hana Japanese eatery, my favorite place for sushi in Arizona.  On this particular night, the mercury had dipped into the forties and I was in the mood for for something to counter the chill.  I tweeted @HanaJapanese asking what was recommended and commented that i'd happily put my stomach into their hands.  What followed was simply perfect.   Miso Ramen A large, piping hot bowl of Miso Ramen soup was first brought to the table.  Steam from the delicate, flavorful broth wafted into my nose causing my mouth to water.  Generous amounts of ramen noodles paired with scallion, subtle spices and pork absolutely hit the spot.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor, texture and warmth this lovely bowl of soup delivered and have since found myself craving more.  While doing damage to the aformentioned ramen, my server brought over a propane fired hibachi grill along with a tray of assorted vegetables and strips of raw steak.  The grill was lighted and I was instructed to add the vegetables (asparagus, pumpkin, okra, long beans and portobello mushrooms) and then grill the meat to my desired temperature.  Forget going to kitchy chains like Benihana or Sapporo where the show is more important than the food, grilling it yourself using quality ingredients and truly becoming a part of the experience is where it's at!  (not to mention, everyone seemed to be ooh-ing and ahh-ing at what was going on at my table adding to the over-all cool factor).   Hana Hibachi Steak  Hana Sauteed Lobster While the miso ramen was warming and hit the spot and the Hana Hibachi steak couldn't possibly have been better, it was the Hana Lobster sauté that really made my night.  Tender chunks of well seasoned, perfectly sautéed lobster served with pieces of chopped asparagus lay before me begging to be snapped up by my eager chopsticks. I just ate and smiled, you have to order this dish and enjoy it to understand how good it really is.  I simply must mention the dessert here, green tea mochi in this case.  I am at a rare lack of words to describe the texture of this little gem. Green tea ice cream encased in a flour and sweet rice dough that was firm, slippery, sweet and refreshing all at the same time.  I hate using word like "delicious" to describe food because it doesnt really tell you anything about the experience but I will here because this mochi is a little weird, fanciful and yes, DELICIOUS!  Stop by Hana Japanese Eatery in Central Phoenix for simple, quality ingredients prepared lovingly and skillfully by a knowledgeable staff and remember something else important, while they will tempt your palate with a plethora of flavors and gladly fill your belly, the restaurant is strictly BYOB so if you like beer, sake or wine with your meal you'd better bring your own.

It is certainly no secret to anyone who knows me, reads my blog, or follows me on Facebook or Twitter, that Im a foodie at heart and will go to great lengths to try new restaurants, dishes or types of cuisine I've not previously experienced.  All of that having been said I have a HUGE food crush on a little gem hidden in Gilbert, Arizona at a place called Agritopia, I'm speaking of course of "The Coffee Shop."  With such a simple name you would be tempted to assume this was a mere coffee shop slinging run of the mill or even above average coffee drinks and you would be WRONG.  While The Coffee Shop does in fact serve up coffee drinks as expected, it is not caffeine which drew me in or keeps me going back.  Lets begin with how I found them and what has brought me to today.  A few weeks ago Joe's Farm Grill was having their 5th Annual customer appreciation day (they served in the neighborhood of 4000 free cheeseburgers but more on that later) and trusty pal Mikey and I dropped in to have a burger and fries.  As we were leaving, I decided I wanted to stop by The Coffee Shop (which is on the same parcel of land) to see what It was all about. Upon walking inside, the salivation began.  There, arranged before me was just about the most mouthwatering display of cupcakes and whoopie pies I have ever seen.  The first thing that caught my eye were the Coconut creme whoopie pies, seemingly very plain but with the promise of greatness if done well...and they were!   These Coconut creme whoopies are just about the best things I have ever eaten (and Ive eaten a LOT).  Unlike many of the whoopie wannabe's I've eaten in the past, the pastry chef here achieved the perfect balance of sweetness, moisture and density with the most pleasant, light crunchy outer texture.  So flavorful was the shell that I was almost taken aback by the creme filling that was obviously made with absolute care and devotion to the craft.  Simply incredible (I feel like there should be a new Food Network show called "Whoopie Pie Wars!")  On to the next bit of tastiness in the form of a tray lined with cupcakes whose sign read "Chocolate chip cookie dough,' YES please.  They looked simple, well decorated but not overdone and I was keen to try one. No flaccid, tasteless frosting here, there's butter creme on that there cupcake.  Sprinkled with chocolate chips and what looks like chocolate Disco dust was the best tasting buttercream I can remember having eaten.  They've somehow been able to create the essence of cookie dough in cake form, a bit of gooeyness, great flavor and yes, i'd eat a whole bag of them. The PB&J cupcake found its way into my mouth next and took me back to my Grandmothers kitchen with her homemade bread, peanut butter and preserves only BETTER (sorry Grandma), it was deliciously dense, the peanut butter buttercream (say that 5 times really fast) was sweet, creamy and perfectly accompanied but a little dab of jelly on top (along with a generous squirt in the middle of the cupcake.) I highly recommend this one.  I did grab a few other cupcakes before lapsing into a sugar induced coma including cake batter, coconut and a strawberry one I got pictures of and ate but whose clever name I cannot remember (terrible journalist...oh, wait, as a Blogger I admire recently wrote, I'm not a "professional journalist!").  Everything i've had so far has caused me to make the 40 mile trek from home to The Coffee Shop for a treat I just can't find anywhere else in the Valley.  If you desire a creative, perfectly made treat, get into your car and make the trip from wherever you might be to THe Coffee Shop at Agritopia.   Check out the Chefs responsible for the creations I've mentioned and more on their recent winning episode of  Cupcake Wars on the Television Food Network.

I moved to Phoenix from San Diego about seven years ago and have been in search of a truly GREAT pizza ever since.  The thing about the "Valley" is that while there are many places to be seen, have a decent pizza (Grimaldi's & Le Grande Orange are notable) or wait in line for several hours for a "good" pie (not even going to go there), I haven't really come across a truly great pie.  While watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives a while back I saw the story on La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale and immediately got into the car for a little drive.  Located in the Historic Downtown district, Piazza Al Forno is a modest storefront pizzeria with few tables and a counter with a view of the pizza oven.  The menu is quite simple but has everything you on it that you need.  My dining companion ordered the Pizza Verde (Veggie Pie), a hand stretched pizza covered in San Marzano Tomatoes, House Made Mozzarella, Roasted Peppers, Caramelized Onions, Mushrooms, Olives and Fresh Arugula ($12) which she indicated was quite good.  The "Italian Stallion" caught my eye with its mix of  San Marzano Tomatoes, House Made Mozzarella, Schreiners Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciuttodi Parma and Sopressata ($13), so ride the horse I did!  The pizza arrived hot and bubbling with just the right amount of cheese (Americans cant seem to grasp that a great pizza doesn't need to be covered in an inch of it) and a perfectly crisp crust with that slightly chewy texture that I know and love.  The meats gave my pie a bit of saltiness that my companion didn't like and she seemed to think it was a bit greasy but to me, it was manna from heaven!  If you fancy a pizza made with care and quality ingredients drop in and check out La Piazza Al Forno, it's worth the drive.

Three words 'Warm Butter Cake!' once you finish your PERFECTLY prepered steak accompanied by any number of delicious sides (I recommend the Lobster Gnocchi, prepered with a pound of succulent lobster & black truffles), or their amazing creamed corn, you simply MUST make room for the warm butter cake! This dessert suitable for two, comes to your table still hot in the center from the oven, with a scoop of fresh vanilla ice cream on top, plump sweet strawberries, orange sucremes and strawberry purée on the side and a cold dish of freshly whipped cream to spoon on at your leisure. 'two thumbs up' for the entire experience

SO the other day I was having a crazy salad craving and couldn't figure out where to go to make it happen.  I remembered being a fan of the Mambo Salad (Wasabi caesar) and since Mastro's is both in my neighborhood and has been one of my favorite restaurants for the past 9 years, I called ahead and ordered one to go plus grilled shrimp.  Arriving at the restaurant, I really wished I had time to dine with the and enjoy a full meal but i'd had a long day and really just wanted the salad and my couch.  As always, all staff members I came into contact with were friendly, neatly attired and welcoming.  My mouth watered all the way home at the prospect of tearing into the cold, crisp green, plump grilled shrimp and the hint of sharp heat from the wasabi caeser dressing but when I opened the container, what I saw shocked and saddened (yes, saddened...I AM a foodie after-all) me.  In the box were the usual mixed greens and container of dressing (key that it wasn't already tossed with the greens ensuring their crispness) and perched proudly atop said greens was one SINGLE grilled shrimp....I couldn't believe it.... At ($11 for salad greens and $7 for the addition of shrimp there should have been at least a COUPLE).    I dug around in my greens looking for my shrimp's buddies but alas, it was truly alone.  I didn't know what to do. I ended up calling the restaurant to ask (which I had not initially) what adding grilled shrimp to my salad consisted of and was told by the manager on duty that there should have been a whole or half shrimp as well as chopped throughout the salad and that he would reverse the charge and I should ask for him when next I dined with them.    Prior to calling the restaurant, I did what everyone does, I posted a picture on Facebook: http://tinyurl.com/cn73btc   Anyway, I ate my salad and savored that shrimp (Actually quite a large shrimp, looked to be a U10 and it was actually QUITE tasty).  Nothing more would have come of it had I not received a call the following day form the General Manager who'd been informed of what had happened by his shift manager and wasn't about to let things end there.  Mark N. Let me know in no uncertain terms that my experience wasn't what he expected of Mastro's restaurants nor up to his standards.  He explained what he though had gone wrong and what he intended to do to prevent it happening in the future.  He reiterated that the charge would be reversed and that he wanted to send me a $100 gift card for the trouble.  I told him i'd been dining in various Mastro's restaurants for 9+ years and had never had anything but great food and service and that the gift card wasn't necessary but he insisted.    Bottom line here is this is what customer service should be.  Mastro's and their General Manager are leading from the top down and setting an example to their employees that customers are not disposable.  Not only will I return to redeem the gift card (while leaving a few extra of my hard earned dollars in the process) but I will continue to dine with and recommend them to anyone looking for a great meal and superior service.   My Facebook post regarding my conversation with Mark resulted in 30 "likes" and 13 additional comments, I'd say this is a "win" far in excess of $100 for Mastro's.  If you haven't been, GET.IN.YOUR.CAR! (and whatever you do, don't miss the warm butter cake of dessert)

When Trusty Pal Mikey mentioned that this place had won Best Fish in Chips in the Valley at some point in the recent past, it was time to jump into the car and head on downtown for sustenance.   Arriving at the restaurant was kind of anti-climatic as on a Monday night during football there didn't seem to be a lot going on (except for a pretty cool DirecTV trailer showing the game which was a nice touch)  There were several tables of mostly intoxicated patrons, to be expected of a bar/pub during a sporting event but the guy sitting ON the table next to ours stretched out in Cincinnati Bengals gear should probably have been asked to call it a night.  It took a while to get a server to clean some unidentified stickiness off of our table, bring menus and take a drink order and about then the table next to ours got LOUDER w/the addition of an off-duty server (confirmed by asking our server) wearing a Rose & Crown shirt and another woman identified as "the girlfriend of one of the owners."  Loud, rowdy, employees enthusiastically dropping F-bombs didn't make for the best dining atmosphere.  Fail there.  Then the starters arrived...The Sausage roll was mostly cold, the puff pastry which should have been light and flakey was gooey and undercooked although the pickle relish condiment was delicious.  The Scotch egg was served cold (the server confirmed this was as intended) which seemed odd to me as I've always had them hot (the British version), the flavor was good but the texture of cold sausage just didn't work for me (this is a personal preference not a knock on their version).  The Fish & Chips Main arrived and I must say, the Chips were superb, well cooked and just the right size.  Then things went a bit pear shaped.  The fish, while piping hot was EXTREMELY greasy and devoid of seasoning.  Luckily the homemade tartar sauce was tasty (though the size of the pickles prevented dipping).   I LOVE a good order of Fish and Chips but was sadly underwhelmed by the offering here and was forced to grab something on the way home to satisfy my hunger.  (note:  The table next to us was joined by a patrons Dalmatian and even though we were on the patio, there are just some places that just aren't appropriate for the little furry people.  He was nice enough to lick my leg a few times during dinner though)    For future fish & chips fixes I will save the 40mile round trip and get it closer to home, very sad that this wasn't as good as i'd hoped it would be.

There's a little purple building on Indian School rd just West of Arizona SR51 housing Stacy's Smokehouse BBQ that I pass by on a pretty regular basis. I've been meaning to drop in and give Stacy's a try since they are a locally owned and operated business AND serve BBQ which is both my love and business.  A couple of days ago I was in the area and feeling those slight pangs that indicate hunger so I pulled into Stacy's parking lot and walked on in.  The place is SMALL with only 4 tables and a counter with a sign that warns customers not to put weight (including your children) on it. There are a series of blackboards hanging behind the counter which comprise the menu and I was excited and intrigued by some of the selections.  As this was between lunch and dinner, I ordered relatively light fare, a large hotlink sandwich, an ear of deep fried corn (how could I not?), an order of red beans and rice and sweet tea.  After a short while my food arrived and I must say it looked quite tasty. The Hotlink sandwich was comprised of two sausage links split and served on a seeded bun with just enough of their tasty BBQ sauce to keep things interesting. It had great bite (though I'd bet the farm the sausage was Farmer John Red Hot Links rather than something house made/made for them), the proper texture (a bit more chewy than say, a hot dog), and pretty good spicy flavor. All in all, exactly what I'm looking for in this kind of sandwich.  I generally get a pretty good measure of a BBQ joint by the care they put into their beans so I was keen to try the red bean and rice (something not found often enough in a BBQ joint in my opinion). The beans were tender and the long grain rice just past al dente which is where I like it since this allows each grain to stand out and gives you a great mouth feel. The 'glue' holding the beans together was quite flavorful, being slightly on the spicy side, and had just about perfect consistency.  ...and then there was deep fried corn on the Cobb. I must admit I thought I'd eaten corn prepared in every possible way but clearly I missed one, this ear was rolled in perfectly spiced cornmeal and deep fried until golden brown. The first bite made me giggle like a schoolgirl! Talk about texture, the crispy cornmeal batter allowed the natural juiciness of the corn to shine and gave it a crunch that has to be experienced to understand. Now I'm a huge fan of fire roasted corn slathered in butter, cayenne pepper and salt but I now have a new favorite.  Over-all Stacy's BBQ was a pretty good meal at a reasonable price that I would happily recommend. I'm looking forward to returning to try Stacy's Hickory and Oak smoked ribs for dinner in the very near future.

I Have a healthy, nearly full term food baby that Chef Becky Windels & The Herb Box restaurant are responsible for!  This quaint little Bistro/cafe' Located on Market Street in Scottsdale's uber chic DC Ranch Area, is a gift to the culinary world.  Having happily enjoyed several of their sweet baked offerings, I decided to give the lunch menu a spin, what followed was a lesson in how to do food right!  Shortly after being seated by a cheerful, smiling hostess our server Maria dropped by to take our drink order and let us know what the day's specials were.  After looking through the menu I settled on the Rosemary Steak Ciabatta sandwich prepared with charred onion, watercress, white cheddar cheese and a Dijon mayonnaise.  A side of the Smoked Gouda Mac N' Cheese with crispy Rosemary breadcrumbs and an order of Crisp Fingerling potatoes sprinkled with sea salt and served with a side of house made red pepper aioli.  While all of this food might be a case of my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I simply couldnt resist trying a little of everything.  After a short wait, the food arrived and I was certain I'd made great choices.  The Steak sandwich was cooked to order, a little short of medium on the softest ciabatta roll I've had, piled high beside it were sweet potato chips dusted with curry powder (why have I never had this before?)  Biting into the sandwich, I experienced the carefully crafted mix of flavors and textures that a great chef strives to achieve.  The steak was juicy and well complimented by the rosemary, crunchy watercress  for added texture and the tanginess of aged white cheddar, all nicely brought together by the Dijon mayo.    The house made sweet potato chips are brightened and brought to life by a deft sprinkling of curry powder making you want to eat more than you should (yes, they sell them to-go and I have a bag atop my fridge for a late night snack!) Let's talk Mac N' Cheese.  I'm going to say it... The Smoked Gouda Mac at The Herb Box is simply the best I've ever had! Creamy cheese and al dente' pasta topped with crunchy rosemary breadcrumbs made this my new favorite dish.  Yes, I know, everyone has a favorite Mac N' Cheese but forget about them!  Try this dish and you will be sold! (I didn't forget to order a portion to-go...I know what's going on at 2 AM when I have the munchies!!)  What's a steak sandwich without potatoes?  Yup, ordered them!  A tasty side of smashed, crisped fingerling potatoes served with a delicious red pepper aioli disappeared just as fast as I could dip and eat! (I can see dropping in for any one of the items I've mentioned so far but together they are DANGEROUS!) okay, clearly I was done eating and in need of both the check and a pillow but enter Maria again who eagerly suggested I try the pistachio ice cream sandwich cookie.  Never one to ignore the recommendation of a foodservice professional, I agreed that I should have one and what came next was wrong in so many ways I'm almost at a loss for words.  Now I've never had pistachio ice cream though I've always heard it was tasty but this was extraordinary.  My mouth and taste buds were assaulted by the flavors of almond, pistachio, strawberries, blackberries and a delicious thick creme', the crunch of the cookies was the perfect counterpoint to the cold soft ice cream and the fruit just completed the sensation.  Think that was the end?  Try again, the dessert case beckons with such a variety of scrumptious looking treats that must be seen to be believed.  If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm a BIG fan of The Herb Box and Chef Becky's Cuisine, if you haven't had the opportunity to visit, make it a point or I assure you, you're missing out!

People often ask me if my intention is to write about everywhere I eat or if I eye new products as material for my blog, the answer is 'yes,' and 'no.' I write about restaurants that I enjoy that are doing things differently than the pack and I write about products that for one reason or another catch my attention. (I often avoid places and products that are either mass market or who it seems everyone 'else' has written about).  That being said, there's a little ice cream shop located in a shopping center at the North West corner of Shea boulevard and 92nd street in Scottsdale called Sweet Republic that has gotten my attention.  I've heard quite a bit of buzz from Phoenix foodies, have seen Sweet Republic featured on television and have eaten their creations on several occasions. In all, my experiences have been quite good. There are several flavors including salted caramel and a mint ice cream made with locally sourced ingredients that I enjoy but when I overheard that there was a BACON ice cream on the weekends for those in the know, I had to try it! (my love of bacon and/or butter has been painfully well documented).  I dropped by the Republic one Friday night and picked up a pint of 'I Heart Bacon,' and giddily headed home (after a generous spoonful as a taste of course). What to do, what to do? This ice cream wasn't just something to be devoured whilst on the couch watching some sitcom or docu-drama. No 'I Heart Bacon' must be savored...it must be enjoyed, it must be painted onto a canvas which can allow it's salty porkyness, to shine.  A stroke of pure genius hit me, I'd combine two of my favorite things in a new way, breakfast and dessert. Bacon ice cream topped Belgian waffles! Why hasn't this been done previously (and if it has, why have I not had the pleasure of eating it?)  A friend offered to whip up a batch of waffles whilst I provided the ice cream and what followed was one of the tastiest breakfasts I've had in a while. Hot, fluffy waffles with a big scoop of 'I heart Bacon' ice cream melting in the center, drizzled with maple syrup will melt  your heart and make your stomach smile.  The combination of sweet cream ice cream, salty bits of chewy bacon and little crunchy mapley surprises went perfectly with each bite of waffle. Each mouthful produced smiles as I enjoyed the contrast between the hot waffle and cold ice cream, the soft, smooth texture of the ice cream and the chewiness of the bacon. I was really blown away by how good it all was.  If you're not one to try new things or if you prefer to sit at the table of normalcy then this is not for you. If however, you fancy a little creativity in your mouth, head on over to Sweet Republic for a scoop, cup, cone or pint of something special. If you REALLY want an over the top experience, pull out that waffle iron, grab some 'I heart bacon' ice cream, a little maple syrup and dig in...you won't regret it!

Once again, my opinions regarding both bacon and butter are well known and though I'm sure there are those of you who are tired of hearing about them, I must tell you about a recent occurrence.   Kelly Garcia of Butter & Me Cupcakery recently contacted me with a SHOCKING question.  She had heard of my love of all things bacon and wanted to know if I'd be interested in trying some of her new Chocolate cupcakes with maple buttercream topped with a candied piece of BACON. Seriously? Did I win the Lotto? Of COURSE I wanted to try them.  A few days later Kelly and I met at the Scottsdale Fairmont Princess to exchange goodies, and talk a little about what Butter & Me is all about. This woman is passionate about baking and cupcakes in particular. Butter and me uses some of the best ingredients available, a little magic and a whole lot of love to make some really tasty treats. Although I did the proper thing and made my manners, what I really wanted to do was steal away and examine read eat my prize!After bidding Kelly and her husband farewell, I headed back to the Batcave for a snack.  After grabbing the requisite cold glass of milk I opened up the pink bakery box and spied six cupcakes secure in their cradles waiting to be experienced.  Could I take the time to photograph these little bacony (yes, it's my word, don't judge!), bits of cupcake happiness?  Nope! There were six of them after-all and photography could wait.  As you can see, I took a big ole' bite and enjoyed the light, fluffy texture of the cake.  The rich chocolate flavor came through immediately without any bitterness and the buttercream had a background maple flavor with a soft mouth feel that wasn't overly sweet (as many cupcake makers can't seem to get).   Perched atop it's buttercream throne, a good sized piece of candied bacon sat, waiting to be eaten and I must say, it did not disappoint. If you want a good honest cupcake and are tired of over-hyped products from certain 'other' Valley bakers, check out Butter & Me, tell Kelly that Tony sent you!

For quite a while now I've driven past a residential building in Old Town Scottsdale, at the base of which is an unassuming red and white sign that reads "POSH Improvisational Cuisine."  After having asked several friends what this place was all about and gathering random bits of information about this mysterious restaurant that "has no menu," "is really expensive,' and my personal favorite "I have no freaking idea," I added it to my list of places I wanted to try out.  Recently I had the opportunity to meet several friends for dinner and POSH was the consensus restaurant choice, so to POSH I went!  Arriving First in my group is unusual for me but arrive first I did.  The "lobby" in POSH is well..POSH, with several comfy chairs and a view of what's going on in the restaurant.  After a few minutes my group arrived and we were shown to our preferred counter seats (the better to see Chef  Joshua Hebert create our dinner), brought cocktails and given the rundown on how things worked.  Presented with sushi style menus, we were instructed to strike through any proteins that we didn't like and note at the bottom any allergies or things we didn't prefer to eat. That was it, a menu would be created individually for each diner in the party by the Chef and his crew of culinary mad scientists.  I ordered the six course tasting menu sans wine pairing for $65, and wondered what gastronomical delights awaited.   My wait was not long as the amuse bouche arrived in short order.  After a few minutes our first course arrived,  potato viscosuisse with chive oil & arugula pesto, a surprisingly lite, chilled soup with a silky texture that begs to be consumed.  All conversation stopped as the members of my party hungrily consumed a variety of tailor made dishes and just as suddenly resumed amidst a chorus of "oooh's,' and "ahhh's," while we discussed the day's events and waited for the next course which in my case was an Heirloom yellow tomato sorbet, sweetened with a little bit of simple syrup, mint oil & tomato caviar garnish. I must say, I never knew tomatoes could taste so exquisite.  The flavor was bright, sweet and fresh with just a hint of acidity and was topped with tiny red tomato caviar which burst on the palate providing just the slightest bit of sourness.  On to the next course of Santa Barbara spot prawns served with a shrimp demi-glace, preserved lemon, capers & baby artichokes. Now I've eaten a lot of shrimp in my time and more than my fair share of prawns yet I've never had them cooked so perfectly.  The temperature was spot on making them succulent and moist , the rich and flavorful demi-glace tasted faintly of the ocean and combined with salty capers had me envisioning waves of flavor washing over my palate.  While awaiting the next course we discussed the different experiences each member of the group had had to this point. There was general agreement that there were flavors, textures and presentation elements that we hadn't had previously and all were eager to move on to the next course which was Fois gras.  I've always heard people waxing poetic about the virtues of foie gras and have generally been ambivalent but no more, the crunchy brulee' was the perfect textural compliment to soft, slightly sweet foie gras (the texture and flavor of which I'm STILL at a loss to adequately describe), served over a sweet coulis of papaya with tiny house pickled grapes and topped with a beautiful garnish of hand spun sugar.  I've thought about this dish many times over the last few days but the only thing I'm able to say is that you must try it!  My next course was lamb which I normally find improperly prepared leaving it with an unpleasant taste and texture but masterfully prepared here.  Served with broccoli, fingerling potatoes & a mustard dill sauce with Chile flakes.  Unfortunately, I wolfed it down so fast that I forgot to take pictures.  I will say that having lamb prepared in this way gives me cause to add it to my list of "likes!"  The next course happened to be duck, another protein that I typically dislike due to poor preparation which leaves it greasy with an unpleasant flavor.  Here the duck was bacon cured served with bok choy & apricot sake sauce. This dish was both visually appealing and absolutely delicious (I've said this about several of the night's items with good reason), it was perfectly prepared, tender enough to cut with a fork, with just the right amount of salty smokiness which went well when paired with the accompanying apricot sake sauce.  Following the duck was a surprise course of Scrapple (a Pennsylvania Dutch favorite), served with Fava beans and the Boar bacon that I've heard so much about. This crunchy on the outside, soft and creamy on the inside staple of the Pennsylvania working man was elevated by Chef  Joshua Hebert, to something extraordinary.  Topped with a crispy poached egg yolk, crunchy boar bacon bits and bright, fresh Fava beans, scrapple at POSH is one of my new favorite thing.

Well, I stood at the bar for 15min with a menu in my hand wanting to order carry out but though the bartender came my way several times, once even completing a carry out order for a guy standing right next to me, I was never acknowledged.  At one point, a woman who also wanted carry out who came in after me, went and sat at the bar & was promptly greeted.  This is where my patience ran out an I walked out.  SUDDENLY, a guy who must have been a manager came out of the restaurant asking if I was there for carry out to which I responded "I wanted to order but I'm over it now."  He politely offered to take my order himself which I appreciated but he HAD to have seen me to know that I was leaving without being helped and after I'm halfway to the car is too late...

Close your eyes for a moment and imagine a wide rolling plain with tall grass and a gentle breeze. In the distance you hear the sound of  building thunder. There isn't a cloud in the sky but the thunder grows louder & the ground begins to tremble. The tranquil landscape around you is transformed as a massive herd of Bison rushes past in a terrifying blur of horns & hide. Now open your eyes and don't be afraid, BBQ has arrived in Cave Creek, Arizona!  Now I've had Bison several times before, though never the ribs, and have always found it to be a bit tough, chewy and somewhat gamey.  Having had the pleasure of several of Bryan's signature menu items previously, I jumped at the opportunity for a first taste.  On my arrival, I was greeted by Chef Dooley (generally behind the counter ready to carve to order), who came out and spoke to me about what his ideas of BBQ in general and this dish in particular are all about.  "Simple, BOLD flavor,' is the Chef's mantra and the basis for everything they do.  Bringing the natural beefy flavor of  Bison to Bryan's BBQ just fits in with what they are doing in this well "seasoned" building where the theme is a modern interpretation of classic BBQ flavors.  Six piping hot ribs were set before me and I immediately noticed the deep pink ring imparted by smoking over Pecan wood.  A taste of the sweet Persimmon Glaze let me know what I was in for as I picked up a rib.  Upon taking my first bite, I immediately noticed how tender, lean and flavorful these ribs were, giving just the right amount of pull from the bone but not coming clean off. (Contrary to popular misconception, properly cooked ribs will not fall off the bone! The only ribs that fall off the bone are those that have been boiled and steamed. This process usually robs the ribs of flavor because water is a solvent. Steamed and boiled ribs usually have a mushy texture. Properly cooked ribs will pull cleanly off the bone with your teeth, but will still have some resilience and chew.)  Persimmons are a fruit that I have not had much experience eating/cooking with but the sweet, slightly tangy flavor worked quite well when rubbed with Bryan's mix of sage, juniper berries and a hint of black pepper.  The things that struck me most about this dish were how well balanced the flavors were and the natural "beefiness" of the meat.  My mind wandered back to that open, grassy plain and with each bite I could literally envision the massive heards of wild Bison that once roamed freely.  As a self professed BBQ fanatic and creator of a line of BBQ sauces and Dry spice rub, I tend to be much less forgiving in my opinion of what "good BBQ' is.  Without reservation, I can tell you that Bryan's get's it right, Chef Bryan Dooley is passionate about BBQ! I happen to know that his hands touch every piece of meat that crosses the counter into a guest's waiting hands. Judging from the quality of this and the other menu items I've had personally, I can say that Chef Dooley's motto of "simple, BOLD flavors" has been superbly executed.  As a side note, since this item was not  available for purchase when I dined, Chef Dooley generously allowed me to try it free of charge.  This consideration in no way contributed to my opinion of this or any other dish served at Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ.

I've gotten my daily grind @ a national chain coffee shop on 16th st & Bethany home rd for quite som time until wandering into Luci's Healthy Marketplace on the opposite corner. Talk about day vs. night!! Luci's harks back to the days of the neighborhood market/coffee house where the propriator and employees not only know your name but how you like your morning Joe! I find that the people working here genuinely ENJOY doing so and are eager to give their customers the kind of experience that is all too often missing in todays frenetic world. I had been meaning to try something from their dinner menu and recently had the opportunity. The home made chicken pot pie sounded like just the thing to brighten up a rainy day so I ordered up one and had a seat at the counter in front of the chef. It isnt often that you get to sit and watch your food prepared to order before your eyes but here I was, comfortably enjoying a conversation with a few other patrons and chatting with the chef while he prepared my meal. The pot pie comes in a HUGE tin which lends itself to transport home, filled with a thick, hearty broth LOADED with fresh perfectly prepared vegetables and plump, juicy chicken. Gently placed atop of the filling is a lite, flaky puff pastry shell which gives the pie the perfect amount of texture and crunch. I REALLY hoped this pie tasted as good as it looked and soon enough I was able ta put spoon to meal and enjoy my first bite...the verdict...it was DELICIOUS!!!! that this is probably the BEST pot pie i've EVER had from the most unlikely of locations is a testament to the involvement of the owners, Ken & Luci Schnitzer who can be found daily making their customers feel like welcomed family. I HIGHLY recommend dropping in to have a meal, a superbly prepared coffee drink or some of their ADDICTIVE house iced tea...a Mediterranean pomagranite citrus green tee.

25 degrees Fahrenheit  is a bit cold for me,  25 degrees Celsius is the typical San Diego day that I miss so much,  but as any Chef knows, 25 degrees as it applies to meat  is the difference between a medium rare and well done burger.  A few days ago I had a mediocre burger at Lush Burger in Scottsdale so when my trusty pal "Mikey" suggested we drop in and have a burger at 25 Degrees in City North I was a bit reluctant. After spending some time at the bar with the menu and cheerful staff, I realized my reservations were unfounded.  Getting rite down to it, I ordered Bacon wrapped Dates ($8) as an appetizer and we all know my feelings vis a vis anything prepared with bacon and/or butter.  Along came a plate of crispy bacon wrapped around sweet dates stuffed with both bleu and marscapone cheeses.  Without the need of dipping sauces they were delicious, I could eat somewhere in the neighborhood of ten thousand of these little bits of  sweet, salty, creamy tastiness!  So many burger joints get the fries wrong but not 25 Degrees, the 50/50 fries were on point!  Skinny as fries should be, these hot little burger sidekicks shared a carton with their sweet potato brethren and arrived hot and full of flavor accompanied by garlic parmesan and spicy aioli's (couldn't get the Chef to tell me what was in it though I suspect red bell pepper and cayenne).  The fries arrive before your burger so that you can judge them on their own merits.  25 Degrees' raison d'être is the humble hamburger ordered either by number (as we Americans have been conditioned to do) or in combination with any of three meats, thirteen cheeses, fifteen extras (including jalapeno bacon and Hatch green chiles), and/or fifteen sauces.  My order was ground sirloin prepared medium, topped with stinky Red Hawk triple cream cheese (from Cowgirl creamery), crisp bacon (again, my love of this salty culinary necessity is well documented), and Hatch green chiles.  Few things are better in my opinion, than a juicy, properly cooked burger.  This one had great meaty texture and was quite frankly huge!  One thing stood out, the Red hawk cheese is very fragrant but if you can get past the olfactory assault you will find a tangy, rich cheese with a creamy texture that ties the other toppings together superbly.  If your in North Phoenix and in the mood for a great burger, a cool atmosphere and a tall glass of Sonoran draft root-beer, make it a point to stop by, have a seat and ask for General manager Courtney Cowan.  Tell her Tony sent you!

People often comment that various Social Media outlets are a waste of time, brain power and lead to a loss of workplace productivity. For me, sites like Twitter and Facebook are a way to connect with like minded people and stay up to date on news and current events. For the Dwivedi family, Social media turned out to be a lifesaver.  Last night FnB Restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale hosted the "Tiny Fab Kidney Fund" late night dinner service to benefit Amy Donohue & The Dwivedi family.  Before getting to the food, a little background on the event. A decade ago, Anu Dwivedi was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Six months ago, her kidney function down to twenty percent, she was told the transplant waiting list was up to six years long. (not a prospect that brought comfort to her family).  Anu's foodie daughter Kirti decided to put her social media obsession to use via Facebook with a page she created titled "Kidney disease and my tiny mother," to learn and share her family's experience. Amy Donohue saw the page and decided she could help. She contacted Kirti, got the required tests done and the rest as they say, is history (or will be in the coming weeks when the transplant surgery is done).  In addition to the inspired cuisine FnB is becoming famous for, Chef Charlene Badman whipped up a few Indian inspired dishes in honor of the Dwivedi's. (half of all revenue from food & beverage from 10PM on + 100 percent of the proceeds of a silent auction totaling approximately $1300 went to the Tiny Fab Kidney Fund).  On to the nights food! My appetizer consisted of lightly battered, perfectly fried rock shrimp ($13) served with a well balanced jalapeño tartar sauce (with a hint of Meyer lemon and fresh herbs).  Alongside my rock shrimp was a heaping serving of three varieties of cauliflower , tossed with spanish peanuts, marinated in fish sauce and mint whose soft insides were perfectly complemented by their deep fried crunch. (this dish is simply delicious!)  Next up were a pair of Samosas ($5) filled with creamy sweet potato and accompanied by a small bit of sweet, tangy dipping sauce who's components slip my mind (Blogger/foodie foul).  Grilled spicy broccoli ($8) with pistachio and Meyer lemon aioli is flat out the best thing to ever happen to that humble green vegetable (its because of this dish that I know when broccoli season is).  A piping hot serving of traditional Punjabi Butter chicken (Makhan Wala Murgh) served over Basmati rice rounded out my meal. (I imagine this type of curry to be comfort food in Punjab).  If I had one complaint about the butter chicken it's that I feel the sauce to rice ratio could have been better. The rich, creamy sauce definitely would have benefitted from more rice in my opinion but the flavors were great.  So then, social media is informative, recreational and the bane of workplace performance but you never know, someday it could very well save your life or that of someone you love.  Side note: If you have ever wondered what it's like to experience true hospitality, make a reservation at FnB. Co-owner and front of house manager Pavle Milic is a study in graciousness, sincerity, service and will make you feel as welcome as anywhere you've ever been.

I've been hearing rumblings of a new burger joint called LUSH in North Scottsdale and had two of the most important ingredients yesterday to warrant a visit; Hunger and time!  My trusty pal "Mikey" (she'll eat anything), and I jumped into the car and drove on over to Lush Burger located in DC Ranch Crossing (southeast corner of pima & legacy boulevard) 18251 north pima road, for what we call "a Derty feed").  The first thing I noticed on parking in front was that the patio set-up looked like any number of Scottsdale clubs with long, low couches and bright colors.  I wondered if this was a burger joint of just another place to "be seen."  Walking inside you immediately come upon a fast-food style counter with LED TV style menu boards that are becoming the "must have" item for hip new eateries and a bubbly teen welcoming us to Lush.  After the above mentioned teen gave us the rundown on how things work at Lush (order with her, find a table and then everything becomes full service), we had a look at the menu. There were several burger offerings with "chic" names including the 'Money" (Kobe beef of course, and should have been "$$$" instead of "money" at $12), and the "infusion" (a 100% Angus beef patty infused with green chile's and pepper jack cheese $10), and of course the obligatory potato offerings including 50/50 fries (half sweet potato and half regular) and their signature Truffle fries (chives, white truffle and parmesan).  I ordered the truffle fries, the Infusion burger (the "chef" suggests medium), and a Sonoran Draft root beer.  We found seats along the counter that were covered in black and white cowhide and waited for our food.  After a while, another bubbly staff member arrived with baskets of fries smelling vaguely of truffle, followed by tasty looking burgers.  The fries were hot, skinny and crisp which I love, but didn't really have the truffle flavor that I was looking for (okay, it was there but very faint and none of the staff seemed able to tell me what they used though I suspect truffle salt), a "B" then.  On to the object of this review, the Infusion.. . I applied a bit of the chipotle aioli, grabbed up my burger, took a bite and promptly got drenched with all of the juice running out of it, down my arms and splashing off of the plate.. While this definitely indicated that it wasn't a dry overcooked burger and I love a little mess with my meals, I thought this a tad much.  Let's talk taste.  The burger was juicy as I've said, and it had good taste and texture but I wasn't getting the flavor of the green chiles and the pepper jack that it was infused with was only vaguely present.  I would have to say it was about a 7 on a scale of 1-10.  The service was great with cute girls doting over us and eagerly supplying us with whatever we might need and the place is definitely worth a second visit (they are working out the kinks since they've only been open 24 days or so), but I would say this isn't my favorite burger joint (it's actually almost too nice to be referred to as a "joint").  One notable piece of the puzzle was the Sonoran Root beer on tap served in a properly chilled glass.  With just the rite amount of vanilla combined with smooth, creamy root beer goodness, this root beer (at $4/glass), was worth the trip by itself.   Check them out on twitter. Over-all, I give Lush Burger a 6 out of 10.  If your looking for a place to be seen, have a decent meal and chill, it's not a bad option but if your looking for a GREAT burger, you'll have to keep looking. (I happen to know where to find one).

Gotta love it when fellow Foodies put together tweetups that involve food and drink, even better when that get together happens at a restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives that you've wanted to try out for ages.  Kirti Dwivedi and Susie Timm decided to gather tweeps at the grand opening of Los Taquitos' newest location on 16th and Glendale avenues in Mid-town Phoenix for a nosh and adult beverages. Thirty or so twitter and Facebook users responded to the tweetvite, showed up, queued up and got down to the business of eating.  First up a margarita made with Tres Agaves tequila and freshly squeezed Blood orange juice. I'm a big fan of the tangy sweetness of blood  oranges and am glad to see them used in this upscale taqueria.  The much talked about 'Bombiero' burrito was served up as my entrée, full of slow cooked carnitas, pico de gallo, and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and bathed in Los Taquitos signature sweet and fiery 'Bombiero' sauce.  I found the pork to be perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, the pico fresh and vibrant but the sauce was a bit overpowering in it's sweetness. I was really looking for this sauce to have a much higher level of heat and spice, but over-all, sweet was the strongest note that I experienced. In my opinion, this sauce would be perfect if the sweetness was dialed down and the heat increased.  Other tweeps at my table enjoyed their carne asada tacos with rice and beans and we all munched on that taco shop staple, chips and salsa/guacamole. I'm looking forward to trying several other dishes including the tacos al pastor and am quite happy that Los Taquitos has opened up on my side of the valley.  If you fancy a bit of up-scale taqueria cuisine, get to one of Los Taquitos' locations and have a go at the menu, you'll certainly not be disappointed.

I met Chef Justin Beckett several months ago when he was the Guest Chef at Petite Maison in Scottsdale for their Late night 'Staff Meal.' Beckett had an energy and deft touch with his cuisine that told me big things were coming for him and the Phoenix culinary community. I began following Beckett's Table on Twitter and saw that Beckett embraced the use of social media to really reach out and connect with anyone who loved food.  I have had the privilege of watching Beckett's table transform from an empty restaurant that went the way of the white buffalo, to the open and inviting space that it has become (more on that in a future post).  On opening night, as I knew I would, I stepped throughout the door of Beckett's dream and into the first meal of my 52 week dining adventure. First up, a cocktail, in my case the 'Paimaire,' consisting of Kettle One Oranj vodka, pomegranate liquor and juice, lemonade 'and a little love.'   This cocktail, like everything on the menu, has a story and special meaning. Beckett tells the story of buying his house from a couple who would become partners in Beckett's table. If the cocktail is any indication of the coming meal, I'm in for a treat.  One of the menu items that immediately caught my eye and whet my appetite was the creamy grits with two kinds of locally made (Schreiner's) spicy andouille sausage ($8) surrounded by a rich, slightly piquant mustard jus.  The grits were a little tighter than I normally like but creamy and with the gritty bite from which they take their name. A spoonful with a little jus, caramelized red onion and bite of plump juicy sausage rolls my eyes back into my head and tells me that Chef Beckett means business.  Of course, one appetizer just wouldn't do and Beckett's Original grilled cheese with four cheeses, pancetta and roasted red pepper tomato soup ($9) is next up.  Buttery sweet brioche and a well balanced mix of cheeses complimented by a vibrant, dense tomato soup that clings to the bread rather than dripping combine to delight. Delicate flavors wash over the palate and something becomes clear, this meal is beyond average.   On to the main course (who am I kidding, main courses!). That's right, two mains made their way to my table, first to go under the fork was a Beef Bourguignon shepherd's pie ($16) with a deep, rich gravy, carrots, parsnips and herbs topped with a raft of light and fluffy mashed potatoes.   Succulent chunks of savory beef nearly melted in my mouth vying with perfectly cooked vegetables for dominance of every available taste bud. Sitting in the restaurant with the front open to the elements, I long for a cold and dreary day for this dish to brighten.  It is a very rare meal which a pork product cannot improve and so it was with great anticipation that I moved the plate of Local Pork Osso Buco ($18) to center stage.  Flanked by moist, slightly chewy butternut squash spaetzle on one side and roasted vegetables including brussels sprouts (yup, I ate em), parsnips that were creamy and sweet on the inside as good roasted root veggies should be, carrot and golden beets (which I had eaten for the first time recently), on the other side, the pork shank confit was simply impressive. Kissed by a black pepper reduction, the meat was absolutely tender and moist, pulling easily away from the bone.  If there were any criticisms of this dish, it would be that I wanted some sort of sauce for the spaetzle as I found it tasty but a little bit lonely. I would have loved for the black pepper reduction to be a bit thicker and for there to have been a bit more as it paired so well with the pork and I would have really loved for there to have been room for dessert (though I'm pretty sure Chef Beckett had little control of that detail)  In all, Beckett's table will take it's rightful place among the most well regarded restaurants in Greater Phoenix and become a must visit destination for fooderati. (if I made that word up, feel free to quote). Stay tuned for next week's meal and a photographic journey of Beckett's Table from hollow shell to culinary hot spot.

Medical Marijuana is a reality in Arizona but you won't need a prescription to get a little "Herb" in old Town. As of January 1st 2011, The Herb Box Southbridge is open and serving up signature dishes to satisfy your munchies.  Helmed by Chef Becky Windels and business partner Susan Smederovac-Wilcox, the Southbridge location combines the catering division previously located further North with a new Market serving an extensive selection of farm fresh salads, soups, signature sandwiches and specials all prepared with fresh, local produce. (I even have it on good authority that neighborhood residents will be able to pick up staples like milk, important as there isn't a supermarket or convenience store in the immediate area).  The menu at The Herb Box Southbridge is virtually identical to that at the DC Ranch location I've written about previously, all fresh, all tasty.  Todays meal, pancetta wrapped shrimp served on a bed of mixed greens. This is one of my favorite plates on the menu.  Salty pancetta adds the perfect texture to plump shrimp and the blackberry wasabi reduction drizzled over it is just plain delicious (sweet with just the right amount of bite at the finish).  Next up, Smoked BBQ Chicken flat bread. Though the menu would lead you to believe the chicken is "smoked," I would certainly disagree.  What I will say is that it's perfectly grilled, the crunchy bacon, sweet tomatoes, red onions and Gouda are a perfect compliment, but the organic greens perched atop, though tasty, just don't work for me on this item. (though it should be said, I generally don't love salad greens on anything more than sandwiches).  All in all, I'm excited that Old Town's first Herb dispensary is open for business and would definitely recommend you stopping by the market for a quick grab n go lunch or sitting upstairs in the warm and inviting dining room for a leisurely enjoyed meal.  **Disclaimer:  This visit was pre-opening at a "mock service" and was free of charge though this in no way influenced my opinion of the establishment.

Need a place to get your heart rate up, blood flowing or work off your dog's excess energy?  This is a great option.  I'm here just about daily and usually TWICE per day with my puppies for a two mile or so walk around the perimeter and interior paths of this well manicured, well lighted (at night) park.  In my opinion, this is a much better option than a dog park even though it isn't an off leash area.  Also, if you drop by late at night with a blanket, this is a GREAT place to lay on your back and gaze at the stars without light pollution to interfere.

What a cool little find!  I first learned of Citizen R+D when a friend and his wife invited me out for a drink.  When you approach the stairs leading up to the bar, which is behind Citizen Public House, you are confronted with a plain white sheet of paper on which are posted the "Rules."  In today's age of excess and access, I was a little taken aback at being told NOT to walk up the stairs to enter but instead to call the number at the bottom of the sheet of rules telling me what I could and could not do.  Being that I was meeting friends, I acquiesced and dialed the provided digits.  The guy who answered (Tony, coincidentally) was gruff and didn't seem particularly interested or professional.  I had to ask if i'd gotten the right number, the response to which was "Ya, how many people you got?" I responded "four" and was told he'd be out in 10-15 minutes when a table became available.  Needless to say I was irritated to wait in a dark  alley reeking of sewage to get into another cookie cutter Scottsdale bar that was more pomp and circumstance than meat and potatoes.  About 10 minutes passed and Tony the doorman/waiter who turned out to be an affable big bear of a guy, came out and ushered us up the stairs to a door where we were stopped, asked if we had been there before (I hadn't), explained the rules, what to expect and then lead through a locked door to our waiting table.  Once inside, I could see the reason for the wait.  There are only about 7 or 8 tables depending on whether or not two have been pushed together.  Parties of 6 or more are broken up so small parties are better.  The room is intimate, comfortable and inviting, the kind of place you WANT to sit down with friends and share a cocktail.  R+D bills itself as a "Speakeasy," harking back to prohibition days and therein lies  of the reason for all of the cloak and dagger.  Cocktails aren't merely "poured" they are actually "crafted" and everyone you come into contact with is well versed in what it is they are serving and how its being constructed.  I've now been several times and though i've seen and tasted several different cocktails, I can't bring myself to order anything but the ********GIN****** For *****Price***** you get a coffee siphon filled with a neutral spirit (vodka), and in place of coffee grounds, a mix of Juniper berries and botanicals which when brewed in the vacuum, turns to gin before your eyes.  Some may think this a novelty but the food geek in me is just fascinated by this process.   Listen, if you're looking for the "typical" Scottsdale bar, cheap drinks thrown together by a busy bartender who doesn't get that "pouring heavy" isn't the same as pouring a good drink or you want drink "your way" Burger King style, go somewhere else.  At R+D the cocktails are expensive (even by Scottsdale standards), the wait for your concoction is between 10-15 minutes (worth it in my opinion) and you order what's on the menu, the way it's on the menu, period.   I'd like to tell anyone reading to go elsewhere so this little gem can stay a relative secret that I can always get into and enjoy but not sharing just wouldn't be right.  If you get a chance and are looking for a refreshing change form the "norm" drop by R+D and tell Tony that Tony sent you!!  (note: ask for an order of bacon popcorn to munch on while your there, you'll get freshly popped corn, chunks of tender belly bacon and though it tends to be a little bit greasy, it is the perfect accouterment to your cocktail.)

So anyone who knows me also knows that when it comes to my cars, i'm both very particular and pretty demanding.  I generally don't worry too much about price as long as it makes sense and the quality of the work or product is justified.  I recently bought a 2013 BMW 3-Series and as much as I love it, it pained me to drive it without tint (you know, the fishbowl effect and I hate being the fish) so I asked a trusted friend for a referral and was sent to Cactus.  Rick knows his tint, has the grasp of customer service that all small business owners SHOULD but often don't and went out of his way to make sure I got what I NEEDED and wanted rather than up-selling me on a more expensive product.    This was about the most painless business transaction I've had in recent memory.  I was absolutely taken care of and charged what I feel was a fair price for the work.  My tint was applied perfectly with no bubbles or wrinkles, in a VERY short amount of time and most importantly to me, my car wasn't a mess afterwards (which has happened several times in the past when dealing with other companies)  If it wasn't for the fact that I RARELY give 5 stars, I would certainly do so here but I would have no problem wholeheartedly recommending Cactus tint to anyone in need.  Bring your baby in to see Rick and be secure in the knowledge that he will take care of both you and it.

Ok, about a month ago I came across a picture of a new food truck posted by Local Foodnik Joel LaTondress, known to the Phoenix food community and the twitterverse as @AZHotdish.  Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a food truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely Lobster rolls and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.  A quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when there's lobster to eat?) and get myself a lobster roll.  The Maine Lobster Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost smell the salt air and then theres the menu... Two different styles of Lobster roll, shrimp puffs and lobster chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal lobster roll and an order of shrimp puffs.  Served on a hot, butter grilled roll sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent lobster i've ever eaten.  This sandwich is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky lobster tail and claw meat and a buttery sweet roll. I cant even begin to describe how tasty this sandwich was and the $18 price was well worth it.  To accompany my sandwich were an order of "shrimp puffs" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay shrimp, a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot interior.  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.  I dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine Lobster Lady at one of her other events this spring and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her menu.  You may live vicariously through my culinary adventures!

A while back I got a chance to meet Chef Payton Curry and try his cuisine at Welcome Diner his short lived concept in Downtown Phoenix, incorporating planned obsolescence. Post Welcome Diner, Curry could be found making guest chef appearances at various restaurants around town as well as throwing "Guerrilla dinners" with his merry bunch of culinary misfits. Over the past few months Curry has been keeping his culinary skills sharp in the kitchen of Chef Charlene Badman at Scottsdale hot spot FnB.  Fast forward to Today and the first service at Curry's newest venture, Brat Haus.  Nestled in the space formerly occupied by Oregano's Pizza, Brat Haus is spread out among two buildings with a "climate controlled" outdoor patio. (The 360 degree mister was a nice touch and quite refreshing on a hot day but I don't know if I would go as far as agreeing with our hostess that the patio is climate controlled)  First up from the Haus, a stone hearth pretzel I have been drooling over on Facebook for the past week.  This rustic pretzel, served with grainy Haus mustard, is just what I had been hoping it would be (so much for maintaining objectivity).  A combination of hard and chewy, kissed with the perfect amount of salt, the Haus pretzel does not disappoint.  If I hear of anyone asking for cheese sauce to dip one of these happy little twists in, I may cry).  I've eaten my fair share of Bratwurst including a few while in Germany which were pretty memorable but over-all, i've just never eaten one and exclaimed "DAMN! that's delicious."  Well, I can no longer make that statement as the Spicy brat ($5.75) topped with my choices of spicy peppers (of course) and root beer onions nestled in a chewy french roll just plain rocked.  Juicy, flavorful and possessed of the perfect meaty texture, the traditional spicy brat is a winner. (there will be many more of these in my future)  Accompanying my brat were thrice-cooked belgian fries ($4.50/Large).  Lightly seasoned frites, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside as they should be, served with choice of dipping sauces (in this case truffle aioli and Sriracha Aioli), the Hause fries are not only a perfect companion to a brat but a necessity in my humble opinion.  Last but not least, the ubiquitous hamburgers, or are they?  You will find a "regular" burger in the form of the Haus Favorite but that is where the "norm" ends.  There is a brat burger i'd probably want for breakfast every morning consisting of a 1/3lb pork sausage patty topped with a fried egg and swiss cheese ($6.75) and the 800 pound gorilla in the room, the "Pig Mac."($7.25)  What's this you say? The Pig Mac? Let me get this straight, Curry thinks it's a good idea to combine a 1/4lb pork sausage patty with a 1/4lb ground beef patty topped with caramelized onions, bound with something called "Hush Hush sauce?"  Well it's a good gawddamned thing Curry has the twisted mind he does because there are few things pork can't make better and apparently a juicy, well seasoned hamburger is one of them.  I don't know why I haven't thought of doing this before but it works.  This mingling of textures and flavors going on here is like the crossing of the proton streams in Ghostbusters except I didn't end up with marshmallow goo on my face.  I must say, I would have rather had a traditional spicy brat split and perched atop my burger a bit more as I preferred its texture and spiciness to the patty but again, this is a winner.  It's about time someone broke the mold and opened a restaurant that didn't fall into line with the current trend of cookie-cutter concepts, frozen yogurt, cupcake shops and gourmet burger joints come immediately to mind.  Curry and his Brat Haus have brought something simple, fresh and different to the Scottsdale culinary scene. (I'm sure others will follow in short order).

What Can I say about Crepe Bar?  Well, I know one thing, I'm a huge fan of Chef Jeff Krauss and Crepe Bar's former incarnation, "Truckin Good Food" and have high hopes for the success of his newest venture.  The space is chill and if the experience at the friends and family pre-opening this weekend is any indication of the quality of the food and service, i'm betting they will be hugely successful.  My first bites included a buckwheat blini with candied almond mousse and strawberry basil, refreshing, light and tasty.  A yogurt parfait with lemon cream, dressed berries, spelt & pistachio fragments and my choice for "favorite of the day" a "breakfast burrito" in the form of a smoked chili crêpe with bacon egg & jack topped with avocado salsa.   All were worthy of note and I'll be back with a full write-up and pictures in the next few days after i've had an opportunity to have full portions of the menu items.
