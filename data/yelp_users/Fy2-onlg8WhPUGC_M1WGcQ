I have been going to Paradise Juice for 10 years.  The husband/wife owners of the shop are incredibly nice, and even with a full staff are always present in the storefront.  Literally every time I have been here, the owners are the ones who take my order and prepare my food (I always order the BBQ Chicken Panini).  While some Mom & Pop shops are questionable, this place is leaps and bounds above any other juice bar or smoothie shop; in both customer service and food quality.  Seeing the proprietors work hands-on in order to ensure the success of their business speaks volumes, and this level of commitment is clearly reflected in the quality of every single item on the menu.  Lifelong customer right here.

This gym obviously struggles to compete with any of the big local chains (ntm that La Camarilla is more than twice as expensive), so it kills me to leave a negative review of a small "mom and pop" facility...but they have left me no choice when, SIX MONTHS AFTER my membership ends I receive a collection notice in the mail for $286.  I immediately called Roger, the GM, hoping that this was some type of a mistake.  Nope, no mistake.  After my 1-year contract was over, they switched me to month-to-month, and continued to charge my account $52 per month.  The problem is, they did not have my credit card on file, so they had no way of charging me.  According to Roger and their A/R Rep (who is old-school in her bookkeeping and extremely rude...beware) they had no way of knowing that I was no longer using the facilities and hadn't been there in 6 months.  Really?  Then upgrade your 30 year old computer system so that you can see when guests check-in everyday.  Bottom line, I have not stepped foot in their gym since December 2015, which is also the last time that they received payment from me.  There is absolutely no reason why I should receive a collection notice 6 months after my membership ends, and 6 months since I used their gym.  I will never recommend this place.

Dr. Stolper has been a close family friend for years, but I never knew him on a professional level until I moved back to AZ last month. For nearly a week after we moved here, my French Bulldog was simply not himself. Normally an energetic little guy who loves to run, I couldn't even take him for a walk w/o him laying down to rest every few minutes. His ears were clearly bothering him, (he gets ear infections frequently), but that had never slowed him down before. I feared it was Valley Fever, so I called Dr. Stolper on Friday night. He was completely booked all day Saturday, but was able to squeeze me in at 7am, which was an hour before they even opened. He cleaned my pup's ears & tail pocket, clipped his nails, and prescribed medicine for his ears. He also determined that he might have pulled a muscle in his back, for which he prescribed a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.   Less than 24 hours after seeing Richard, my Frenchie was back to running circles around the backyard. I was completely astonished! I've never seen anything like it- back to 100% in less than a day. It was a miraculous change after weeks of being miserable and clearly in pain. I will never take Napoleon anywhere else.  Thank you Richard, you are truly a Godsend.

I had an amazing 2-night "stay-cation" this weekend and absolutely love this hotel.  If you're looking for a fun pool party to enjoy with close friends, absolutely get a room here.  Unfortunately, my fairy tale stay ended abruptly when I went to the lobby on Sunday morning to ask for a few trash-bags for dirty laundry.  I was told my the front desk that my credit card had been declined, so my room key was deactivated and I was not allowed to do anything until they had another card on file.  My embarrassment and panic quickly turned to anger when I realized that my card was getting declined due to a fraud block my bank had placed on my account after the W made 3 separate charges totaling over $1,100. Do NOT disrespect me by saying "we need a new credit card because yours got declined" when you charged me over $1k in error.  After the manager, Jilly, looked into my situation I was showered in apologies and was told that she had no idea why I was charged so many times or what the charges were for.  In the interim, my room key was deactivated, I couldn't use the elevator to go back to my room, where my girlfriend and dog were waiting for over an hour while this situation was resolved.  I had an amazing stay at your hotel, but unfortunately the billing/collection issue and the embarrassment of being told that my card was declined (due to being VASTLY and erroneously over-charged) left a horrible taste in my mouth.  I was offered no restitution other than a "sorry for the inconvenience".

How has a class action lawsuit NOT been filed against  this company!? I will be reporting them and have an appointment with my attorney next week, and he is very interested in moving forward with this.  Their deadbeat drivers claim to deliver your package, but steal the item instead, knowing that Amazon will cover the customer with a refund or replacement. My "same day delivery" last Monday was supposedly signed for at 7:10pm at the front desk of my complex. The office, however, closes at 5pm so please tell me how this is possible. I opened an investigation with Ontrac the next day, and after jumping through hoops was told that the driver will come back to show me where he apparently delivered the package. Driver was a no show and refused to cooperate with the Ontrac dispatcher. I filed a driver complaint and was told that his manager would call me. That was 8 days ago, and I've contacted them 3 additional times since then...it is literally impossible to get a manager on the phone or get any type of explanation from them as to why no one has contacted me.  Even the dispatchers are trained to advise the customer to just reorder the item...apparently this happens all the time. Never have I had this problem with UPS or Fedex.  Anyone who is interested in discussing this class action lawsuit with my legal counsel please contact me directly.

Unlike the other reviews on here, my delivery guys showed up on time.  However, I paid $1,700 for a couch that I find out is made out of cardboard.  Both arms of the couch are flimsy and can easily be "wiggled", primarily due to the material that they are made out of.   This must also be due to the fact that they were lifting from the arms and carrying up a flight of stairs, because there is no reason why a 1-day old couch should be in such bad condition.  I didn't notice the stains on one cushion or the smashed side arm until after the delivery guys had left, so I will most likely be disputing this charge on my credit card and getting my money back.  Stay away from this place.
