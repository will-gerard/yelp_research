Pretty decent sports bar.  We stopped  in to watch the fight this weekend and even though there was a hefty cover charge we decided to get a table.  The night turned out to be pretty pricey but we enjoyed ourselves.  Food was ok we enjoyed the sliders and nachos were just meh.  Our drinks were great and our server was busy but kept  everyone happy.  We were seated in a weird section called the Cotton Club? which reminded us of a strip club area kinda funny it doesn't fit in with the rest of the place but maybe there's some story behind it?  Anyway glad we stopped in.

We went up to Phoenix for a Tom Petty concert last year and were excited to check this place out.  I absolutely loved it!  I love old hotels like this and this one was great.  Rooms are small due to the fact that this hotel is old but still comfy and cozy.  The staff was very friendly and breakfast was very good.  The hotel was within walking distance of a few bars we visited and it turned out to be a good trip even though our concert was cancelled.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because they lost our reservation on the first night we were supposed to stay BUT then they paid for a night at the Mariott around the corner.  Great customer service!!

We stayed here for a night this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations.  I needed to use up a free night so we decided to take a quick trip to Phoenix and just have some fun.  I know the Garden Inns are kinda towards the bottom of the totem pole of Hilton hotels so we showed up not really expecting much and were very pleasantly surprised.  The hotel itself is just fine, minimal in decor, nice and clean and simple.  But everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful it really put this over the top for us.  Gary checked us in and was just genuinely so nice and helpful.  He gave us all the information we would need covering parking, location, beds etc and offered himself up if we should need anything else.  The parking lot is separate from the hotel but that didn't pose a problem for us.  The room again is minimal but covers all the basics and we found it comfortable, aside from the pillows but not a big deal.  Finally we were running late to hit the town and noticed they had a courtesy vehicle so we asked about it and the man behind the counter (sorry I didn't get a name) quickly got up to take us a little further downtown.  So accommodating!  Any employee we passed by was quick to greet us and it just made us feel welcome.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, very surprisingly impressed.

We are definitely fans!  Came back for another visit since we were in the area again and I have to say service has improved tremendously!  Everyone was eager to help us and they were all very friendly without being annoying.  We have yet to try the food, next time.

This place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!

We recently stayed at this hotel for a night before our very early flight the next day.  It did the job for our one night and we would stay here again if we needed to be near the airport.  Check-in was fine.  We stood in front of a couple of desk agents for a minute or two while they typed away at their computers before either one acknowledged us but then they quickly checked us in.  The room was spacious and smartly set up for the amount of room it had.  The bed was a king and it was comfy enough except the pillows were terrible and flat.  Finally this hotel has it's own restaurant and bar which is always a plus.  We didn't know that so we had stopped at the nearby Ruby Tuesdays on our way in.

Meh is right.  I booked this hotel through hotels.com and their pictures seemed the best out of hotels in this area.  Next time we'll just stay downtown.  But we were here for a concert at Ak-Chin and weren't familiar with the area so we stayed here.  Check in was quick and friendly enough.  They were remodeling the lobby and I hope that continues throughout the hotel because it is very dated.  Carpets are stained which makes them look dirty.  Room is very sparsely furnished.  You're getting the bare bones necessities here.  We only needed the room for a few hours, we literally got here from the concert, slept and left first thing in the morning, so it did the trick but I would look at your other options first.

Terrible hotel and even worse service.  My friends and I stayed here when we came to town for the AZ Strong Beer Festival.  We wanted to stay in Tempe even though it was pretty far from where the festival was going to be.  We tried checking in when we first got into town which was early but we usually don't have a problem.  This time we were told we couldn't, ok no big deal.  However, later that afternoon when we returned to check in they gave us a leftover room that was not what we needed.  There were 5 of us and we had specifically reserved a room with two queen beds, we were given a room with one king bed and one cot.  Without even a hint of remorse, an apology or explanation.  Um what???  We too asked to speak to a manager and there wasn't one around, seems very odd for a hotel - or any business.  In the end we were each given one free drink at their bar, great.  That's the only reason for the second star, the bartender was very friendly and was eager to make sure we were happy but we will not be back.

We have been to this restaurant twice now and absolutely love it!!  The buffet is always well stocked with delicious fresh vegetables, meats and cheeses but of course the real winner is the roasted meat that is carved at your table.  All the succulent cuts are wonderfully seasoned and cut at your table by temp you like.  We had the lamb, top sirloin and ribeye and everything was perfect.  Along with the great meal is great service, everyone is there to make sure you have everything you need at all times.  Finally you have to try their cheesy biscuits they are so great!  You definitely have to try this place at least once it is amazing.

Awesome festival!!!  Some friends work for Barrio so they filled me in on it and convinced me to go.  We dropped off the car at the hotel and took the light rail in - mistake.  The trek alone from the light rail to the park was long and hot and we were really ready for beer by the time we made it.  But once we were in we had a great time, what a show!  So many different breweries from all over with a wide variety of beers.  I wish I'd taken more time to look for shirts and stuff but I was too busy enjoying myself.  The layout was really spread out so it never felt too crowded - except for a section they called The Village which had a DJ and seemed fun.  Overall yes it was really hot and I was surprised they didn't have more shaded areas or water stations but I will be back next year for sure.

Interesting little place.  Seems more suited to the drive thru crowd but they do have a small dining area inside and a little patio too.  We were staying down the street at the Four Points Sheraton and needed some breakfast so we took a quick walk down here.  We weren't really sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich with chicken sausage and it was tasty and filling!  I also tried the cactus fruit iced tea and it was great.  My friend had the croissant sandwich with pesto and it looked good too.  Wish there were more of these places around.

I'd had my eye on this place for a while and we finally got in to check it out this weekend.  Nice open area with a good sized patio too.  We sat at the bar to watch the Derby since we ran out of time to get anywhere else.  They had it on TV but without sound, oh well not a big deal.  We loved their beer selection and the bartenders were all on top of everything, helpful and efficient.  We had a great time and all the food coming out of the kitchen looked awesome.  We only tried their 'pretzels' which are actually just a few little loaves of pretzel bread, not the same but not terrible.  The stools are not the best and not very comfortable but in the end we enjoyed ourselves and were glad we got the chance to visit.

We had a pretty good time seeing Florence and the Machine at this venue.  I have been here just a couple times in the past 10+ years and I have yet to have a terrible experience. We sat on the lawn and were able to hear the music just fine, plus the huge screens allow you to see the artists pretty well.  I guess my biggest complaint would be with the price of the beers.  $15 for a Four Peaks?! Youch.  Plus they stopped serving at a certain time before the show and there was still plenty of music still to play.  Finally the parking lot and exiting routine was nuts.  We had taken an Uber there and when we exited it was a crazy mess of everyone trying to leave at once.  I'm not sure if there is just the one exit but that's all everyone was using that night and it took FOREVER.  We were planning on walking out of the mess, somehow, and trying to get a cab to pick us up outside of the lot but that seemed dangerous once we were out there and by some crazy luck we ran into a friend that took us to our hotel.  There should be a safer way to exit on foot.  Other than that all the employees were very friendly and helpful from security at the gate to attendants by the lawn and the food/beer vendors.  So just bring plenty of money, a comfy blanket to sit and have a ride on-call and you'll have a good time!

Wow!  I had tried their beer at Tap & Bottle and wanted to check out their brewery on a recent trip to Phoenix and surrounding areas.  We LOVED it.  Their menu is varied and unique and good!  From their beer braised & bleu burger to french cut wings and green chile pork sliders we tried them all and left barely able to move.  And the beer!  We started with the Refuge IPA and hardly were able to stray from that.  I believe we sampled a RyePA too but the Refuge was our favorite.  We enjoyed ourselves so much on our first day that a couple days later we made the detour again so we could stop back in on our way home.  This time we filled our stomachs and a growler to go - and threw in a couple shirts.  Can't wait to be back.

This continues to be a favorite of ours and warrants a detour any time we are staying in or passing through Phoenix.  They have expanded over the years but everything stays consistently great.  Service, food & beer are awesome!!

What a great find!  We had seen this place on an earlier trip to Phoenix and just never had the time to check it out.  After an NBA game at the Arena we decided to stop in here for a drink and some snacks.  It seemed like everyone else around had the same thought because the place was packed.  We put our name down for a table and were quoted a 45 minute wait.  About 20 minutes later we were called back, awesome!  We proceeded to spend over an hour enjoying the great cocktails Bitter & Twisted had to offer.  We tried a couple of their mules and I loved that they served them in the cans of Goslings.  For food we tried the pork belly and paired it with their grilled cheese, delicious!  We had a great time and our server was fantastic, making sure we never ran out of anything.  Our bill was brought in a hollowed out 'book' and when we were ready to pay she was able to run the card at our table.  I love those little details, can't wait to be back.

Very cute brewery!  We wanted to try something different and opted to check this place out on our way to hunt down our hotel.  It was mid afternoon and the place was nearly empty, which was great for us.  We sat down at the bar and enjoyed a few beers and some appetizers.  Their beers were great!  We tried the Stripped Copper Amber, Old Skool IPA and Rose Saison and enjoyed them all.  Appetizers weren't quite the hit the beers were but I think it was just our preference.  We ordered some cheesy bread that somewhat resembles Brazilian cheese puffs except much more dense and served with a tomato sauce that isn't very flavorful.  We followed that up with a cream cheese salmon dip that had little cream cheese and the salmon overpowered any of the other ingredients in the dish.  Not to say the dip was bad, just not what we were expecting based on the description.  Finally we ordered the wings and they were tasty!  However, once we received them we realized we were running late so we asked for a box and the check after we tried some fresh and of course they were still great later.  We always try to stop in to AZ Wilderness whenever we have anything to do in Phoenix but now we're going to have to add this to the list too, we enjoyed ourselves!
