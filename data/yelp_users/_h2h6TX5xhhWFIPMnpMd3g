My wife and I love this place. Our go to for dinner and a movie, everything I've ever had here is delicious. Maybe it's partly the nostalgia for me as I grew up with Mi Amigo's in the east valley. Consistently great food at a decent price, can't complain about that.

Sitting at the bar as we speak. I always tell people how much I miss all the dive bars San Diego has to offer. Problem solved at HB Hanratty's. A dive bar after my own heart. Thanks HB!

The "Big Rig" Pasta calls my name more often than I'd like. Living close to this much delicious pasta and deep dish pizza is rough on the waist line. Always great service, especially outside at the bar.

I really don't know what people are bitching about. It's a steakhouse, so how is the steak? I've had the porterhouse and the ribeye, both medium rare as a steak should be prepared, and both were excellent cut and quality. I take my steak seriously whether I'm grilling it or ordering it and this place knows how to grill a steak. High heat, salt, cracked pepper, and butter. Perfect. The sides were excellent as well and we've always had friendly service. I'd take Lone Star over Outback any day. I only wish we had a Cattleman's here, but this is the next best option.

I guess The Cheesecake Factory doesn't really require a review but here's my two cents. I was a bit irate when they axed my favorite dish, the crispy spicy beef. Fortunately it was quickly replaced by my new favorite, the gumbo. I'm not really sure how a kitchen can specialize in every cuisine known to man but they manage to pull it off somehow. If i have one complaint, it's the excessive use of butter, which I can taste on my lips after every bite of almost every item on the menu. Then again, butter makes it better right?

I hate giving bad reviews. Actually this is the lowest review I've ever given. I'm not sure what else to do when I pay $23 for a pizza that arrives cold and so soggy it's completely inedible. Straight to the garbage and off to buy dinner for the second time tonight. Awesome.

Generally I like to avoid Starbucks but you cant deny their dedication to customer service. Not so much here. Ordered an iced coffee with vanilla and it was soo sweet I couldn't stomach it. I asked the young woman to top it off with some more coffee to cut the sweetness which prompted a debate as to how much she would need to charge me. Um what?? The manager stepped in at this point telling her to top me off, with tone of inconvenience reminding me to "get half powder next time". No, "next time" we will go somewhere else.   I already thought it was odd that nobody at this location smiles. There is a friendly little coffee shop across from Zipps on 59th and Union.

Alright, I'm officially off Starbuck's...when I'm in Phoenix at least. I ordered the coffee of course because how else are you going to determine the quality of a coffee house without testing the main ingredient. So one iced coffee with irish cream and low fat milk...Boom! my new favorite coffee house. The decor is quaint and artsy. Stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work. I even like the building itself, which appears to be converted from a 50's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna head down early and enjoy a newspaper in my new favorite coffee house.

I would love to love this place, support my local economy and all that Jazz but I just can't. The staff is always extremely friendly and I love the beach shack in the middle of Phoenix. Problem is, the food just isn't very good. The only thing more bland than the carne asada is the chicken. I've had mexican food in Minnesota and I'm pretty sure it had more character than this local gem. Sorry Two Hippies, you have a solid concept going but your menu needs a serious overhaul.

Sit at the bar and ask for Sean. Great drink prices considering the atmosphere and very strong drinks. This is also an Absinthe bar if your in for something different. In addition to the drinks they have great local DJ's throughout the week and on weekends. Good vibe, good drinks, great service...

Finally got a chance to stop in and definitely do not regret it. I'm glad I found a solid little taco shop close to our place because two hippies just aint cuttin it. I had the pastor tacos and carne asada tacos and they were both delicious. Very homemade authentic taste and ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait to head back for more!

Great downtown spot, day or night. I enjoyed it as a bar several times before I ever had a chance to sample the menu. Three words...Mac N Cheese. Delicious! probably the best mac n cheese I've ever had. True, the food does seem to take a bit longer than average but in my experience it's been worth the wait. Keep up the good work!

Finally found a great traditional breakfast spot close to home. The wife and I hit Joe's Diner this morning and we both loved it. I had the corn beef hash with eggs over medium, biscuits n gravy, and potatoes and it was probably the best breakfast I've had since the Hash House a Go Go, San Diego. Excellent food and a great value. Can't wait to try their lunch options. Staff was very cheerful and friendly as well...

First trip to Windsor after driving by countless times and it did not disappoint. I had the brown bag chicken sandwich with a side of mac'n cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The service was fantastic which is a big factor for me in my star rating. We were only there for a bite but it's definitely the kind of place I could hang out for a few drinks. It looks like they have some pretty reasonable drink specials before 5:30 on weekdays. Also attached is a candy/ice-cream shop so guys, if you're looking for a great date spot, Windsor will impress...guaranteed.

Awesome job rejuvenating this bar from the dark dive bar it was. They have a great selection of brews from all over AZ, the US, and the globe as well as a very decent wine list. Thus far I've tried the pork tacos and the grilled cheese, both of which were delicious. Service was a little on the slow side as our server was clearly over-loaded.

I'm guessing it's been covered repeatedly but I'm not sure I'll ever be able to go back to this place without having the cinnamon bread french toast. Good God, I'm craving it a week later. Most likely I'll just keep getting it and steal bites off my wife's plates to try new things. Well done Wy-Knot!

Had a couple bad experiences with vendors stating they could not reach our condo due to it's distance from the parking lot. Called Robert who stated it would be no problem. He arrived on time and did a great job with the filthy carpet left behind by the previous owner. Not only that but he was the highest value of anyone I contacted. I would definitely recommend him to firends/family.

Great Chinese can be difficult to find in the middle of the desert, but this place is delicious and friendly every single time. They also have some curry options so more diverse than your typical Chinese restaurant.
