Im not gonna lie here, The Elephant Bar by my house (Torrance, Ca) is terrible. So I was reluctant to eat here. But since it was in Arizona, I figured I'd give it a whirl.   The African jungle theme is really cool at this place. The upholstery has zebra skin, elephants, and jungle; pretty cool. The service was pretty quick,me specially since we had 23 persons in our group. The drinks were flowing and the food only took about 30 minutes to come out.   I had Angel hair pasta with shrimp in lobster sauce. Overall, it was pretty good! Lots of flavor and plenty of shrimp!  I made a point to try other dishes on the table to provide the best review possible. I tried the shrimp plate, Mongolian Beef, appetizer sampler, and Breaded chicken. The food was pretty damn good. All pastas and meats were cooked just right with nice presentation.   I enjoyed my time here. The staff was nice, food was tasty, and drinks were flowing. All pointing to good times!

This was a nightmare of a visit. Let me tell you how it started a catastrophe but ended on a slightly positive note.   The wife and I were very excited to be in Phoenix, Az. We were in town for a roof-top wedding at a nearby venue. As we pulled up, I saw that the hotel offered valet parking. Due to the fact the underground parking structure was too far, we chose to utilize valet.    The valet experience was a nightmare. I parked my car in the line of vehicles waiting on valet service. The wife and I exited the vehicle and began to gather our belongings. I looked up and saw no vehicles in front of us indicating we were next. WRONG!  I looked up and saw about 5 valet employees screwing off on the curb. I had to yell, "Excuse me, you guys valet right?" They rolled their eyes and began to argue amongst each other. When they finally settled their dispute of who was going to do their actual job, a young kid approached our vehicle. He took our keys and gave me a ticket. But then he asked a nearby female employee for some help and she quickly replied, "You're going to have to ask someone else. I'm busy." She wouldn't help a fellow employee out and was a total jerk about it. The look of embarrassment on the valet kid's face was heart breaking. Talk about a crew that hated their job and was equally as unprofessional.   It carried over with the front desk personnel as well. We approached the front desk where there was a line of approximately 8 persons. There were 2 clerks working the front desk but when I approached the open clerk, she said she was not helping patrons at that time. So I went back in line were there were now approximately 10 persons waiting. It should be noted that when I came back down to the lobby about an hour later for a drink at the bar, the line was approximately 25 persons long.   As I waited in line, my wife took a walk down to the concierge to arrange a taxi. When she asked to have a taxi called in an hour's time, the concierge didn't even look up at her. She pointed towards the front of the hotel with her left hand and said, "There will be taxis out there all night." Given that my wife is a hotel manager in Los Angeles, she was appalled. At least provide eye contact if you're going to be rude!   We got to our room and saw that they presented a very nice room. We thought, "What a shame. This is a beautiful hotel. Too bad the service is so terrible."   Getting ready for the wedding, we both took showers. Everything was going smooth until I reached for the towel. Let me make this clear . . . .  I would not wash my CAR with their towels. The towels at this hotel were extremely thin and stiff. Not only were we shocked that such a nice hotel would present this filth, but it ruined any momentum the hotel was building.  Due to the fact I was ready long before my wife, I headed downstairs to the bar for a glass of wine. The bartender was very friendly but I must admit, his appearance looked as if he just rolled out of bed. His attire was sloppy and wrinkled, his hair was a mess, and he was at least 2 days unshaven.   It was almost as if the hotel staff was rebelling against the management. There was no class in this place.   The only positive experience I had at this hotel came when I needed my wedding band retrieved from my car. I asked one of the valet employees to retrieve it for me out of my vehicle and he did so rapidly.   I will not be returning to this hotel. There are some things that can be overlooked but a common denominator of poor service is not one of them.

Hollywood hits Chandler!   This Courtyard Marriot was a super trendy hotel with a modern feel. The bold feng shui hits you right when you walk into the lobby. Usually, Arizona hotels provide a desert environment. Not the case here.   The lobby walls were peppered with flat screen TVs and earth tone colors. It was quite welcoming and warm. Personnel was very friendly and hospitalble. Prices were terrific as well.   The rooms werepretty big; as were the bathrooms. One improvement I saw that needed attention were the towels. They were rough and thin. Perhaps just a bad batch.   Another improvement I saw needing attention was the food quality in the lobby bistro. The pizza tasted microwaved and the burgers tasted blan. The menu read well but the food couldn't back it up. Good thing the bartender had a heavy hand with the Crown Royal!   I'd go back! Great spot- just eating out next time.

A weak start but a strong finish . . . . . .    The wife and I spent the weekend in Arizona. While visiting some friends there, we made a special visit to Z'Tejas. This place was spoken of highly and came highly recommended.   I was impressed from the start. Walking up to this joint, it looked nice and modern. The outer walls rolled up allowing plenty of fresh air in and an open environment. The dim lighting and unique oil paintings provided an elegant yet romantic energy. I liked it immediately. However, I gotta say, the mint colored  table clothes were hideous. But it was like the staff heard me say that to my wife because they changed them to white almost immediately.   It took almost 10 minutes to get service. When I stood up and began looking for a server, she approached me and explained that her last table was a nightmare. She was awesome from there. Further more, she introduced herself (Chris) twice and was perfect from there on out. Personally, I like when servers offer suggestions or their favorites. Shows they care.   The appetizer was retarded good! It was comprised of a spicy avocado and shrimp topping on a crispy cracker. The spicy avocado and smoked shrimp were battling for dominance. But together, they were a dream. I could have eaten 50 of them summa-bitches.   My entree was even better. It was comprised of four pork tenderloin medallions stuffed with chorizo. I mean, really? Who thinks of this? It was like art!  Damn near belongs in a museum.   To top it off, we had Kalua cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was fresh, moist, and otherwise perfectly executed. A Kalua based sauce was drizzled over the top of each slice. This slice could have gone toe-to-toe with The Cheescake Factory. Real Talk!   Overall, I really liked this place. LikemBrooks and Dunn said, it just gets better all the time. Can't wait to go back!
