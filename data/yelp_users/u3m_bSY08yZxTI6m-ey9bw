Went to Welcome Diner for the first time this past Saturday. They had a veggie burger on special that I really wanted to try, but sadly they ran out before we got there. Instead I got the vegan po-boy sandwich with a side of fries (which i'm so happy I chose). It was so yummy, and super filling! The menu has lots of great comfort food items, including some vegetarian/vegan options.   The staff was awesome and super friendly. The place has such a neat vibe as well. There's truly nothing like it!

I'm a big fan of the wood-fired pizza, and when I saw they had a vegetarian pizza I ordered that in a heartbeat. The pizza came with zucchini, mushroom, roasted red pepper, and artichoke. When the pizza came, it was strange because each slice only consisted of the one topping, it was not distributed throughout the full pizza. Having a slice of pizza with one thin slice of zucchini on it was not what I expected. As we were down to the last coupe of slices, we also noticed there was a long black hair on it - really gross. This place has a cute and cozy atmosphere, but I probably would not go back. Maybe if I ordered something else it would have been better, but overall I was very disappointed with my meal.

Cornish Pasty never fails to disappoint. I love that they have lots of vegetarian options and even a couple vegan options! They have a great beer selection as well and super cheap Irish car-bombs (my favorite) during their happy hour. The staff is always super friendly and on top of things. I'm so happy a place like this exists!!

Thai Elephant is my new favorite Thai restaurant in Tempe. To start off I got the thai sweet potatoes. The description said light-battered sweet potatoes with a house tamarind sauce. I thought it would be actual sweet potatoes, but it ended up being regular potatoes with the sweet dipping sauce. The description was a bit misleading, but it was delicious nonetheless.  For my entree I got the pad thai with tofu which was delicious! It really was the best pad thai i've ever eaten. My boyfriend got the green curry which he said was amazing as well.The service here was great too. The staff was very friendly and quick. I will definitely be back!

I really enjoy this location of LA Fitness. I recently signed up for a membership and I had Alex help me who was extremely helpful and informative during the whole process. They have a lot of machines and equipment, as well as a pool, cycle room, racket ball, and basket ball courts. I left off one star because I wish they had sanitizing wipes so I could wipe down the equipment before and after using it. Overall I'm definitely a fan of this gym and it has everything I would need to have a good workout.

I like H&M because they have nice work clothes that aren't too expensive. This store has a good selection as well. Shopping there is a hit or miss for me, though. The reason i'm taking off a couple starts is because of the staff. The employees have been rude to me and not very helpful. I have been to this location quite a few times, and not even once have I been asked if I needed help finding anything or in my size (which I usually do), darn european sizes! But really, what happened to good customer service? It's definitely not here.

I went to Golden Feet for the first time the other day, not sure what to expect because I had never experienced reflexology before. It is definitely different than a regular massage at a spa, but it was very relaxing and enjoyable. The massage therapist did a wonderful job, and made sure to ask me if the pressure was too much. I felt very refreshed right after and even the next day. The reason I left off one star is because of how the rooms are set up. The room itself is pretty private, but you can definitely hear in the rooms next to you. I even heard a woman belch really loudly in the room next to me during my session which was a little unsettling, but I tried to not let it bother me. I did the 60 minute session which is only $30! I will definitely be back in the future.

Hummus Xpress is one of my new favorite vegetarian friendly spots in the valley. I went here for the first time a few weeks ago after a neighbor posted about it on Facebook. I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the choices, but the staff was very friendly and guided me through the ordering process. I ended up getting the vegetarian bowl, and they had a great variety of veggies, hummus, salad, and topping to choose from. Everything was extremely fresh and full of amazing flavor. The prices are reasonable too for the amount of food you get. Their iced tea is really delicious too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh and fast Mediterranean cuisine.

Update- The last two times I have been here and ordered my meal to go, I have unfortunately found hair in my food both times. I really love the food, but finding hair in your food really ruins it. Hummus Xpress I love you, but please be more careful when preparing and serving your food!

I miss Orange Table! The menu at Park Place had changed since I ate there about a year ago. They used to have a great selection of their pancakes and now they only have 1-2 very basic options. Ended up getting the french toast which was really burnt and not very tasty. No one in my group was very happy with their meal. I could make a better breakfast at home honestly. Used to love this place, but sadly do not plan on returning. You're better off heading over to AZ88 for some brunch.

I had placed a large order the other day for pick up, and unfortunately they messed up 3 of the 8 orders. Sadly they were mistakes that prevented people from eating and enjoying their meals. I thought my bowl was fine until I pulled out a 12 inch long black hair from my guacamole. I frequent other Chipotles around the valley and have never had such a negative experience as I did at this location.
