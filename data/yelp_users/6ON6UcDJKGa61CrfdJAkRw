Well I gave them a chance based on the rave reviews below.   my mistake.    I just got my garments back in worse condition than they were when I gave them over for cleaning.   there's a tear in one sleeve and another item looks like it was slept in it is so wrinkled.   even when I asked them to press the item a second time they brought it back to me and said "oh she pressed it again" and of course it still looks terrible. I'll be doing my own pressing from now on since apparently I'm the only one who can get wrinkles out of linen.  When I voiced my concern, the quote unquote manager looked at me as if I were speaking German.  I'll not be going back.

Went in on the Groupon ($39 for $200 worth of goods/services, which was clearly stated on the Groupon site, R.I.F.) and was warmly greeted, shown every courtesy, allowed free reign of my browsing and frame choice (though the ladies both shared their opinions, I felt no need to listen to or accept their advice.)  I was allowed to fiddle with the knobs on the machine so I really got the best vision option, and paid $109 out of pocket for the extras I wanted/needed, AND picked up my new glasses the same day.  Great deal, great service, great experience.  Worth the drive, I'd do it again and would recommend this place to anyone with simple eyewear needs.  I read all the other (negative) reviews and all I'm getting from them is "I'm angry because I didn't understand how Groupon works!" so if you're prone to not comprehending what you read maybe get someone to explain it to you next time.

I've been eating at the Sahara since 1994 when a date took me there for dinner.   I take EVERYONE there at least once, and now that I've moved out of Tempe, I make a point to go to this restaurant if I happen to be in the vicinity.  Great atmosphere, gracious service and consistently fantastic food.  I love Ali, Noor and the whole (family!) staff at the Sahara.

Irritated.  Despite what both Yelp and their website state, the restaurant is not open between the hours of 3 & 5 p.m..

If you question their (shoddy and unprofessional) business practices, you will get the guilt-trippiest sob story you've ever heard.  "This is my business and I run it the way I want and this is a happy place and I don't need this crap and I have to do what I have to do and and and" blahblahblah.  Any other groomer in town would listen carefully to the client's concerns, address them in a positive and polite manner, and take the client's money.  These folks are apparently doing so well that they can pick and choose - if you are a savvy consumer with good business sense and the willingness to ask uncomfortable questions, you will not be welcome here.  Take your dogs elsewhere (Puff & Fluff on 16th street/Bethany Home is very accommodating and SO DAMN NICE) and save yourself the aggravation.

Date of incident was in January.    Food was OK.  Took 55 min. for fried rice and sweet and sour pork. Didn't bother to put any sort of utensils in the bag either so had it not been for a Good Samaritan, we would have been eating with our fingers. This is clearly unacceptable. I will go elsewhere in the future
