Mom and I have been looking to buy a house in that area for months and have stopped to eat here 4 times and every time it has been delicious. The customers are friendly, the staff has always been friendly and the food is great. So far the chicken pot pie is my favorite. We just bought a house in desert vista which is just around the corner and we are so happy because we love this place. We will be seeing allot of it soon. Prices are reasonable too. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!

This restaurant was horrible! The floor is filthy they drag a huge specials board around the restaurant to each person that comes in. A man there,  must be the owner, is loud and the food was very bad. They actually serve veg-all that comes from a can as part of a dinner. The brown gravy was like a gel and it tasted horrible! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!

Not impressed!! I lived in New York for 10 years so i was very hopeful but my mother and i went there for lunch and i had the Cajun crab cake sandwich. The bread was hard, crab cake soggy and it hardly had any Cajun sauce. It came with a shot glass size of cole slaw and a pickle. I ended up taking crab off the hard bread. Mom had the Cajun turkey and had asked the young man to put Cajun sauce on side which he failed to do so when I took it back up to him to remake he was rude about it. Mom could not eat remake because of hard bread so I went back up and asked for a sample of their pastrami, more like a piece of rubber. Needless to say, we declined another sandwich and left. I do not recommend this pseudo "NY" style "Deli" at all! There are way too many better places to eat. Plus this place was over priced! Good luck!

Horrible food and service! Myself, my mother & my daughter went to this restaurant a couple of days ago & we were very disappointed in the service. Although the waitress was nice enough she made several mistakes on our final bill. She verbally gave us the wrong prices for the special & then when our bill came she had charged us for 3 drinks which we did not have. She over priced me on the special but she blamed it on the computer & when she went to change the bill to the correct price she came & it had not taken off the extra money on the special which she specifically said it had. Even though she apologized, she did not try to make it right at all.  We told her to make sure to NOT charge card for the first wrong price & she assured us she did not. Today my mother checked & she DID charge us both times! The food sucked! The service was worse and now she will not let us talk to the manager! She said she can not reverse the charges & all she can do is ask the manager on MONDAY to send us a check! Bull s*#@ !! I was a server for years & I know it's possible & I also know that she had to charge mom's card twice at the end of her shift! This is just unacceptable. Don't waste your time or money at this dive!

I've had pizza from this location at Papa Johns twice and it was very disappointing both times, don't bother! The pizza was too doughey and there was not enough of the toppings that we had ordered plus the chicken wings were all skin and fat. They forgot to bring the extra sauces that we had ordered! I would never order from Papa Johns again!

We love this place! We often make a special trip just to go eat there! Love their shish kabobs and the food portions are very big. The prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice and even the owner when he is there goes out of his way to say hello. We highly recommend eating there.

I have gone to this restaurant a couple of times with my family and have enjoyed it very much. My daughter lives in Scottsdale and goes there all the time and she's the one that recommended it to us and took us there. The first time I had a sandwich and a juice and it was delicious!  The next time I had one of their shakes and it was delicious! The other thing that I love about this restaurant is that it is healthy! We tried every one of the baked goods that they had that day and they were all delicious! I would recommend this place to everyone!

Awesome, awesome, awesome! We found this place by accident but thank God we did! We had the potato and bacon soup, it was homemade and delicious! We also had the penne pasta with vodka sauce and chicken and it was so good and everything is fresh and homemade! For dessert we tried one of their 100% fruit smoothies and of course it was delicious! Not to mention the service was wonderful and the owner was very accommodating! Needless to say I highly suggest eating here and it's good for you! You better believe we will be the eating here in the future!
