Great complimentary house made chips and salsa and the limit 2 margarita is the best I've had in awhile. Our server was very helpful and she did a great job given the busy night. The wait was a little long but the food and service was awesome and will definitely bring me back here!

Love this place. My girlfriend and I are regulars here and always love to try whatever their single tank series is at the moment. Although you can never go wrong with their Raj IPA. Food is awesome as well!

So I guess I was dragged here with a group of my friends to see a drag show, I usually am down for whatever but this group of girls did not impress me at all. It was one night where they were doing star choice drag show and the talent there was just not talent. Not to mention they jip you on drinks if you pay with a card which I assume most people do. The show was definitely a disappointment, and I'm always one for a good show. Although I can say the Vibe here is a little more chill than Charlies but I won't be returning anytime soon.

Pretty cool place to go if you want to check out a revolving sushi bar! Sushi is good, definitely not the best I've ever had but for the price I'm not complaining! You can get a lot of sushi for not that much with is awesome.

If you're looking for a classy, high end bar, look no further. This place is the place to go if you're tired of the Mill Ave or Old town crowd. Was here last night and I have to say it was an excellent change from the drunken dabs on mill.The staff and bartenders are courteous and super friendly. I'm more of a beer guy but I tried some of their cocktails and they were definitely note worthy. Five stars for the high class atmosphere and the sophisticated patrons that regular this place.

Called up this location to order some chocolate covered fruit for my girlfriend the other weekend. Spoke to a guy named Chris who was super friendly, he helped me pick out an awesome gift for her that she really loved! Overall an A+ in quality and A+ in service. Will definitely be getting another one of their arrangements  sometime soon!

Food taste good but the girls there are rude and the cream for the coffee is always nasty and warm! I don't recommend spending your money here.

The only reason I give 1 star is for the decent food, which is way overpriced for the quality and service. I've been into this place 3-4 times now, each of which leaving annoyed with the terrible service and promising myself not to come back but the location's convenience brings me in.

I hate this place so much, they always take forever even though they have 10 people working the 5 orders... I don't understand how they can be so unorganized and unprofessional in front of the costumers. Way over priced for the mediocre at best food. Don't waste your time or money.

Super good stuff! I just wish the wait wasn't as long as in was for just a frozen yogurt! The layout is very modern and clean but a little small for how much clientele they bring in. I'll be back only because it was so delicious.

Super good stuff! I just wish the wait wasn't as long as in was for just a frozen yogurt! The layout is very modern and clean but a little small for how much clientele they bring in. I'll be back only because it was so delicious.   I changed my rating to five stars because on my most recent trip this morning. Not only was the food delicious and nutritious. It was an awesome service and all the staff were super fun and engaging even with how busy they were. Keep up the good work!!

Gila River definitely did an excellent job on this one! These outlets are my go to whenever I need something. They have an a lot of high end retailers such as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Bahama, Hugo Boss and many more. I would definitely recommend checking this outlet out if you haven't already. It's an outdoor mall and the landscaping stays true to its location with beautiful streams and ponds along with all the native plants and cacti of the southwest. My only complaint is I can never find any parking close to the stores I need to go to which is understandable for such a popular destination.

Love this place for their craft beers. Their food is pretty good too! But our last visit was phenomenal due to our experiences with the staff. Our server was so awesome and friendly, I just had to give her a review on here. Keep up the good work guys!

Love coming to this place for their breakfast on weekends. They have awesome Greek food, probably the best in town! Try their Greek fries!

Despite the fact that we found this bar in an alley which was super sketch, this place is the place to be. Love coming here on weekends. Bartenders and security are super laid back and chill, all around fun place to make a stop at for drinks on Friday or Saturday night. Be sure to check out who they have playing at their venue right in the same location, although some shows you have to pay to get in to!
