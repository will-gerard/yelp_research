Drove 30 minutes to get one of the vegan pasties.   Sat down, ordered a beverage and asked what the vegan daily specials are.  Server told me they aren't making any vegan pasties today and suggested I just get a vegetarian pasty instead.  Really??  NOT the same thing.   If you're going to put vegan options on the menu don't just decide not to.  Either make them or take them off the menu.   Major waste of my time.

FINALLY!!!  A restaurant that has learned that you don't have to cook farro or quinoa in chicken or beef stock!!!!   Thank you so much for the seasonal vegetable salad.  AMAZING combination of everything delicious in a bowl and vegan friendly

I just spent a lifetime at Einstein in attempt to grab a bagel to go.   After what seemed like an eternity I started timing the process - 35 MINUTES to get a bagel to go ??!!  The place was clearly mismanaged - orders were taken at the end register rather than the first counter causing a long line of grumpy customers.  We were asked twice to move out of the way to allow an employee to wheel a large cart through the line to restock orange juice.  Why she had to use the cart to carry 3 orange juice was a bit of a mystery;  I can only assume it was yet another attempt to annoy their already displeased customers.  When I finally reached the register I found a grumpy woman who repeatedly mumbled something at me that another customer finally interpreted as "toasted?".  After paying I was shuffled to an area filled with people standing around, arms crossed, frowning in the final phase of this farcical adventure.  As orders were ready yet another unhappy employee barked out descriptions of the items ordered - thereby causing further confusion among the angry crowd.  Finally - my order was ready and not at all worth the wait.  I will never return to this Einstein and will instead take my business across the street to Bagel Nosh.

Great cute spot with yummy food!   I had the jackfruit sliders - lots of food here and really tasty!  The fries were hand cut and had a great salt/pepper seasoning.   One and only complaint is a relatively limited menu but I'm guessing that will change as they are brand new.   Definitely a keeper.
