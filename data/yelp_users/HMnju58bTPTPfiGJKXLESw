This place is pretty fun! Staff is friendly, and it stays cool, even in the summer. I have been here twice and both times had a pretty fun time. It was not as intimidating as I thought it would be. My only advice for patrons is don't go in shorts!!! :P

If I ever go to Applebees again, I will only order drinks. Every time I go there I get really sick afterwards!! Even a salad there turns my stomach sour!! Its so weird, and I am not the only one either, my boyfriend will get really sick after as well. Drinks also take a while to get every time we go.  Now the servers at Applebees are very friendly, it sucks that they have to sell such a bad product!!  I hate seafood, and I would much rather go to red lobster next door to this place.

I always feel so good when I eat here! Fresh food, and a wonderful atmosphere, I love getting the peanut butter, chocolate chip, banana sandwich thing and sitting outside and feeding my crust to the birds. DInner and a show! The iced tea is pretty good as well.   The only problem with this place is the line is sometimes so long because of how great it is!! :P

Dr. Burns is completely wonderful. We had to put out dog Candy down a few months ago, and she and the staff was completely wonderful. The best vet we have ever seen, and I have horses so I see a lot of vets!! Her and the entire staff had excellent bedside manner, and gave us all the time we needed without us even having to ask. They did everything possible to make sure that we were ok and gave us honest opinions. The one thing she said that stuck with me was, "This is the ultimate act of kindness we can give our pets". It was so comforting. A week or so later, we received a sympathy card in the mail, it was so kind and supportive. When we are ready to get another dog, Dr. Burns will be my vet for sure. Thank you so much for treating our animals, and us, with such kindness.
