I can't say enough great things about Shane Co and my experience there.  They were ZERO pressure, totally geek friendly and they spent more time teaching me how to be an expert, hand holding me through anything and everything I wanted to know than actually trying to sell me something.  Very good hearted people, lots of care and attention and lots of nice ladies getting emotional and teary when my now fiance's Mom and I came in to pick up the ring when it was all done.  Very good stuff.  She did say yes by the way!!!  I have to say, I went to Jared about a year and a half ago.  I got a bad feeling in my stomach, they were very used car sales like, high pressure and they hounded me by phone for weeks after.  The people at Shane Co honestly cared about educating me, teaching me how to be an informed consumer and they honestly cared about the story of my beautiful fiance and I.  Sonia and all of the others there during those two days are amazing beautiful caring people.    Second to all that, I even asked for a fairly large price off the setting and got very close to what I asked for  (near free) .  They're fair priced and flexible if you ask.  Very good stuff.  The free stuff you get is also VERY awesome.  Their warranty is amazing.  If she ever breaks it or any of the stones fall out (including the main stone) they replace it for free.  Free sizings for life, free cleaning and touch ups if the white gold ever needs to be redipped... I mean just great stuff.  I was really worried about going to a LARGER jewler like Shane, Jared or others... but I will always recommend them.  Thanks Shane CO!

I have a Whirlpool Gold Fridge with an Ice Maker that wasn't making ice.  I called and they were able to come out the next day.  The day before Thanksgiving even!  He was able to show me exactly what happened to the old one, replace it with the new one and was very very friendly and fast.  I was worried about the cost but they were able to give me an accurate estimate over the phone for $222 which is what I was charged when he left.  I was very very pleased, and thought they did a great job!  Until.....  2 hours later the ice maker was still not dropping ice.  I called them and they thought it could have been the optical sensor that was also bad.  He told me over the phone how to test the optical sensor which I did.  He was correct, it was not working.  Now here's where I'm irritated.  The entire reason we called them and asked them to come out was because we needed the ice maker working for Thanksgiving.  The tech should have taken the 10 seconds to test the optical sensor but did not.  By the time we called them, they said they would not be able to come back over to take a look until 6 days later.  6 days!  Finally they come back out and take a look and now they're saying I need to pay $125 for the optical sensor and an additional $25 in labor.  Now mind you, I've had 6 days to stew about this.  In these past 6 days I've looked up a bunch of youtube videos and this is literally a 10 minute job that can be done with an off the shelf screw driver and a $30 5 star reviewed part from Amazon.  I'm a little sore that after paying $222 for them to do a job that they're wanting to make even more profit after not catching their first mistake.  I understand that these guys are skilled workers and I'm taking a risk doing this myself but I work on electronics for a living and based on the videos, it looks like an easy job.    Keep in mind, I'm not trying to get something for free here.  I understand that workers and companies need to make money, but trying to profit off of their mistake is not good business.  In all fairness when I told the guy on the phone my feelings about this and let him know I can get a generic part for $30 or the whirlpool official part for $70, he finally offered to let me order it online and he'll come out himself and install it for me.  For an additional $25.    Honestly, not everyone gets it right the first time, but when you pay for convenience you expect it to be done right.  And if it's NOT done right, AT THE VERY LEAST make good on the deal instead of trying to make more money.  The guy on the phone admitted it's a REALLY easy install and I should have no problem doing it myself.  So I guess I'll just do that.  I'm not going to pay an extra $150 to fix something that should have been caught the first time.  All of the above said, they were very fast getting out to my house and the tech was friendly.  I don't really appreciate that they charged me full price for a non-whirlpool (OEM) official Ice Maker but I was willing to look past that based on they were saving my butt for Thanksgiving.  But that didn't really work out.

This place is amazing. Family owned diamond in the rough. I always get the shrimp po boy and the potato salad. Here is a protip: put TONS of the their Cajun seasoning on the potato salad. Oh man. So good.   The wait isn't bad at all, keep in mind people, this isn't fast food. They make EVERYTHING fresh. Nearly everything is made in house.   It's always a pleasure coming here.

This place is amazing. Make sure you get the shave and everything. They give you hot towels, a hot lather shave, massage, shampoo. Seriously amazing.  Make sure you get an appointment with Emmili. She knows great men's style and is really great and laid back. I got a great old school gentlemen's hair cut, shave an they shaped my goatee.   I can't speak highly enough of Emmili and MUGG. Go here!

Our company had a Sony Vaio Z series laptop that needed the screen swapped out.  I provided the part from a spare laptop and they replaced it same day for only $60.  Amazingly fast an inexpensive.  Awesome stuff.  Thank you!  We will most definitely return with all other laptop repairs.

I can't tell you how amazing our waiter James is. We had such an amazing time. James guided us through so many gorgeous craft cocktails. Seriously, order the "lawless". Stephanie, their drink MASTER, whipped up what I assume is a tobacco voodoo orgasm concoction. You will not be disappointed.   Thanks so much for the amazing drinks, the phenomenal tater tots  and all the laughs James!!!

These guys are amazing. Keith was here for 3 hours spraying inside and out. He even dusted all the bathroom fans and stuff. So thorough! Better price than I could find anywhere else. No contracts or anything. Seriously they were half of the price of others.  And they took their time, educated us and Keith is so friendly.  If you're west of the I-17 and need a bug guy, please call this family. Very very awesome service! Keith was amazing.  I felt so apologetic that here was here for so long, his answer was "We always are here as long as it takes".  We'd never had a pest control company at our home before and had a big black widow and ant problem.  He spent so much time carefully getting all nooks and crannies, making sure all that spots that they could get in the house were covered.  Not only that though, he spent time teaching me anything I wanted to know.  Very very good service.  EDIT:  We've been using them now for what, over 2 years now.  Still the best in town.  Great people great price.  No contracts, really awesome.

We weren't sure what to expect but we were blown away. We got a dozen glazed donut holes and a cream filled glazed. They were AMAZING!!!!!   The style of donut is more of the very light and fluffy Krispy Kreme type donut rather than the heavy dense Dunkin donut type... We very much like the light and fluffy type!!!!  It's also neat that if you get a jelly or cream filled donut, they fill them right there for you. Pretty awesome!   I can't help but think these guys are giving Krispy Kreme a run for their money. They were so busy that they could barely make the donuts fast enough. And they were making tons. Make sure to get there early because they are going so fast.   I'm so happy to see a small mom and pop donut business do so well. I wish them much success.   Keep up the awesome work!
