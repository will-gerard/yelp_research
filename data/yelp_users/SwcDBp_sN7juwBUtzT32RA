This place has pretty solid pizza with nice crust, but the service absolutely ruins it.    The staff will flat out forget your order, forget to bring it out, and it's always generally a mess to order carry out.  Somehow they manage to always look frazzled and extremely busy even when there's no one in the place, and no one coming in for carry out.  I don't understand at all.  I'd recommend avoiding this and going across the road to Pizza Re.  Way better food and service.

This is my favorite quick bite to eat in the area.  I stop in so much for the carne asada burritos that the guys there know me and always say hi.    I'd say the only downside is they recently raised prices so it's not quite so easy on the wallet to get a meal anymore, but I live my life one burrito at a time and it works.

Four peaks is my favorite brewery in the area, especially in the Tempe location!  You'll be drinking and eating right inside the brewery next to the tanks.   Come in for the beer, but stay for the food.  The chef in this joint is on point, and everything I've gotten to go with my brew has been mouth watering and delicious.   They release seasonal beers every so often, and will open up with a growler sale where you can come in and buy it to take home.  Also, I understand that they will have lunch specials with things like elk burgers which I really want to try.   I'd say the only down side is the lack of parking, so I'd recommend arriving extra early and parking a ways down 8th street to walk in.

I just moved here from Orlando, where I had an amazing Indian place I frequented.  Delhi Palace is now my new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant in the PHX area, so much that I don't miss Orlando.  I'll definitely be back even more times in the future to try more dishes.    The staff has always been quick and courteous, despite not always speaking English that well.  The food is the real draw.  It's fantastic!  My favorite is the Fish Masala.  Give it a shot!

This place is a Tempe staple and has a very nice, trendy, hipsterish atmosphere which attracts the young night life.  They have pretty solid oysters, sandwiches, and fish tacos.  It's a great spot to enjoy a beer and get some decent late night food.  When I'm in the area I usually stop by and grab something with friends.

Fantastic location, ambiance, food, and beer selection.  I can't speak for the wine, but it looked good as well.  This place is definitely worth the visit, and you'll probably come back for the more traditionally prepared Italian pies with things like prosciutto and oil/pesto based sauces.

I like this place for mainly the beers and atmosphere.  The original one in Tempe is the best, of course, but the others are pretty cool.  The food?  Well, I'm not the biggest fan of British inspired food but it has a very home cooked feel to it.  If you like calzones and such, you'd like pastys.  So far I've had the meat and cheese one, and the curry one.  Will make it back to try more.

Getting tired of their unannounced internet service outages all times.  There have literally been three periods in the past week where I've been without service due to "maintenance".  They said they were improving service, but I really didn't have a problem with it until they took it down completely.   They are pretty bad, almost Comcast bad.... and that says a lot.

Barro's has some of the best fast/delivered pizza in the valley, and typically when I go I have a hard time not eating the entire thing myself.  The crust is actually the best part - crispy on the outside and just the right amount of soft doughyness on the inside.  The toppings are fantastic, and when you get delivery it always comes fairly quick and piping hot.  Now, even though I love the crust it does come with a warning - eating this crust is like ingesting a bag of concrete.  If I'm enjoying a Barro's pizza I know I won't be taking many restroom breaks for the next week or so, if you know what I mean.

This place is fun until the terribly behaved trashy pit bull owners show up, and then it basically turns into a mad house because they can't control their dogs.  I'm not sure if it's just the demographic in this area, or the type of individuals they attract, but I've ended up just turning around and leaving almost every time due to this same circumstance.  As others have said, they're almost always the type that will just stand there and watch their dogs start fights and laugh or do nothing.  In the future I'll just go out of my way to go somewhere that at least has separate big and small dog areas.

This place has amazing food for such a small and quaint location.  I came in with the running group and ordered the Carne Asada Torta with a side of mexican corn on the cob, and it blew me away.  Some of the best food I've had in the area!  The service was a little slow, but not too terrible that would keep me from coming back.  I'm a fan!

They have some of the best middle eastern food I've tried in the valley.  Try the schwarama plate (for two), and you won't be disappointed.  Always fresh and well seasoned.  The only reason they don't get five stars is the slow and inattentive service.  At least 3/4 times I've eaten here, the guy who I believe is the owner has had to come out and take orders because the waitresses simply disappear for long portions at a time, and don't pay attention to the tables.

This place seems to be nothing more than an elaborate scam to charge your insurance company as much as possible via multiple scheduled visits for the same or slightly different issues, and funneling patients through a mill and into their approved "physical therapy" partners.  They even go so far as to have another "company" on the same floor to do specific X-Rays despite clearly having the same staff working at both offices.    Don't come here if you want a legitimate answer, or legitimate help.  They'll only end up charging you and your insurance company a ton of money, and writing a generic "prescription" for physical therapy.  Complete and total waste of time, and a rip off.

This is my go-to place for fast food beef schwaramas.  Amazing because it's in a mall.  Drop in and give them a try and you will not be disappointed.    And, yes, I'd suggest getting something besides the fries on the side.  The fries are a bit soggy, but I shouldn't be eating french fries anyway.

I ate here for the first time, and ordered the signature pizza (forget what it was called).  It was hot, fresh, delicious, and best of all - different.  I will absolutely be going here in the future when I want some fantastic locally-owned pizza faire.  Avoid the streets of new york across the street and come here.  You won't be disappointed.

As a self-described pho affectionado, I'll say that this place doesn't have the greatest soup ever.  Don't bother getting carry out, because they will cut down the meat portions to almost nothing which is a bit irritating.  Not only that, but they seem to consistently get my order completely wrong if I call it in.  I suspect it's due to the loudness of the place, but it's still not excusable at all.  I'd say if you want to hang out, drink beer, sing karaoke, and otherwise treat it like a bar, it would be fine, but for a great Vietnamese meal you should look elsewhere.

This little place has the best tacos I've had in the area.  The way they cook all of the meats right on the coal fired grill behind the counter, along with the various toppings, makes for a brilliant little place to stop in for lunch.  My only regret about Ta Carbon is there is no location in the east valley!   I have a feeling they'd make a ton of money out here, as there aren't a lot of taco shacks with amazing food.  I just wish I lived closer.

QT is the best.  Hands down.  Forget about Wawa, or any of the other coast's stations.  QT is is it, and I'm not just saying this because I grew up in Tulsa.  I come into this one almost every day to grab cheap gallon waters, cheap breakfast sausage hot dogs, and cheap energy drinks, and the staff there is cool and knows me on sight.    This location is in a bit of a rough patch of Scottsdale road, so you have to deal with bums sitting on the curb outside but if they are annoying customers, the staff will tell them to leave.  That's more an issue with this specific location than anything.  PS: The woman below leaving QT one star because she's fat and can't stop eating gas station food is a moron.

Fantastic casual burger joint in old town Scottsdale.  I love to come to places like this and relax to avoid all of the heuty-teuty snobbery going on elsewhere in the area.  Burgers are well prepared and delicious.  I recommend the blue cheese and bacon burger, with a cold beer of course.

I found Area 15 through Google, and must say I'm thrilled I did.  I ended up bringing my AR15 here to be cerakoted in "Desert Sand", and they were able to turn it around on time which is already more than other shops can accomplish.  So next, I get a call saying Chris wasn't real happy with the color, so I went in to check it out.  Needless to say, the parts came out looking AWESOME.  As a consummate professional, Chris still gave me a discount even though I was fully happy with the work, which I used to pick up some extra accessories for the build.  It turned out amazing and I've gotten nothing but compliments on it at the range or during training.    This level of attention to detail and  is exactly what you want in a Cerakote shop, and is exactly why I will bring ALL future refinishing jobs to Area 15.  Thanks again!
