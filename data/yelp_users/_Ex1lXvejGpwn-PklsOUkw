Any place that cracks my lobster claws for me deserves 5 stars and a nice tip!!!   This waiter was great!!!   We started with 2 crab claws that did not provide very much meat. This was okay with us, because when the entrees were served it was clear we did not need an appetizer.   I had lobster stuffed with crab! Yum!! It was cooked perfectly so there was not too much hassle to get the meat out. Then the waiter offered to crack my lobster claws and pulled out this scrumptious piece of meat that was heavenly! Oh my.   My date had surf and turf which is huge. A full prime rib and a full lobster, I think it is meant for 2 people? Delicious none the less.   Everything was great here.

We had lunch here and the service was not so good and the food was whatever.   Upon arrival, the hostess informed us there was a wait even though several tables were open because they were short staffed.   We waited, and watched as they sat people who came in after us? We mentioned this and they said ooopps.   We were then seated with a waiter who was too busy and not too bright. Service gets 2 stars.   We ordered Sushi and the rolls were small with lots of rice to make them look big.   The bill was $70 for two of us and not worth the price. I don't think I would try this place for sushi again. The other part of the menu looked alright though.

I totally didn't get it, and never found any of it funny.   The whole thing was just stupid and put me and my friend in a blah mood so it was hard to get motivated to go out afterwards.   Talk to people who are similar, your friends and then see if you should go.

I have now been here twice, and both times I had the luxury of drinking Cristal; The nectar of the Gods!   This place has great ambiance and fantastic service. For $95 per person you get a first course, second course, and a dessert.   I had Alaskan King Crab Legs to start. Pre-sliced just the way I love 'em!!! Then I ordered the surf and turf- scallops wrapped in bacon with short ribs that are marinated for 14 hours!!! The meat was incredible. I wish I could write like Ruth L. to describe just how amazing these short ribs were.   For desert I had berries and cream! Another favorite of mine that just went too well with my Nectar of the Gods!   This meal is my ideal meal, this would be my last meal on earth should I ever get to choose like that. It was so fantastic!!

Sure the lobby is fancy smancy but the pool is a hole in the ground filled with water and the rooms must have been left out of the recent renovation.   They have a 4PM check in time and a noon check out time. 4PM seems a little too late, and seriously 4 hours to clean a room?  I also have not seen a TV that small in a hotel room let alone in any room since my grandma's kitchen.   The price was ridiculously high for the room/TV/bathroom/ and pathetic pool.  Service was alright. $261 a night.   The restaurant was beyond awful. Service was a joke and food was terrible.   I would never stay at this hotel again.
