Very impressed with the teachers and curriculum.   Well kept campus and modern classrooms. Apollo  exceedingly passed our expectations. Both of our children graduated from this school within the last three years and are doing very well in college.

A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic "gym" sales crap. AFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke!   So everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks.

Obviously we all know Sprint is still "working" on their tower upgrade in Glendale but this store has gone downhill. Walked in today 6 employees literally standing around chatting. Brian helped me but we could tell he hates his job..it shows. Horrible attitude, poor customer service skills. Their network is horrible! I even overheard an employee mention she's afraid she'll be fired due to customers complaining about the network and how dead this Sprint store is now compared to a year ago.

First time here after driving past it for over 11 yrs! They always say if the restaurant is kinda dirty and bathrooms are outdated and completely gross then the kitchen probably isn't maintained that well etc. Their tea was like water, very dry buns, stale ..won't be back!

Worst gel manicure ever! The nail tech was in a rush, finished in less than 25 minutes, sloppy job. Even worse, the gel polish is coming off after only four days! She told me it would easily last two weeks. Save your $ and go elsewhere!

Unfortunately, this restaurant has gone downhill quick. Super salty meat, tasteless sauces, canned shredded chicken. Sodium, sodium! Won't be back!

Pretty surprising for a sports bar. Excellent variety, higher end quality and consistency with everything we've tried here! Even their steamed veggies are amazing. Try their honey medium spicy wings! Bomb! Great service and drinks.

EXCELLENT and known for their PANCAKES!! Amazing! All breakfast items are very good including their omelettes. Don't go to a restaurant that specializes in breakfast and expect their lunch to be good. Went there one time for lunch and would've rather had a sandwich from a hospital cafeteria. Eight years of going there for breakfast. Great price and serving sizes.

Amazing service every week. Pastor Don is the best! Unlike any Christian church out there. No wonder it's growing to be the 9th largest church in the Nation!!

Very very tasteless food, drinking water that I could shock our pool with! Waitress was nice, prompt service but food is bad. If you like bland mexican food than this is your restaurant.

Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a "drink". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's "filtered". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied "it's the same". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants on Bell Rd.

About the BEST Mexican Food Restaurant in the Phoenix area. We've tried pretty much every Mexican Food Restaurant in the Valley. Excellent service, Good Quality Food that tastes amazing. The Chili Shrimp dish is awesome. Great hot sauce!! Happy Hour is pretty crowded but worth the wait.

Had been seeing Dr. Edgecomb for seven years who left this office. I was reassigned to a brand new Dr...Horrible! Found out she was let go. They recently lost my blood work and put it in another patients chart!

We have purchased numerous appliances at this location and referred clients as well. Prices are great but the sales staff seems so unfriendly!  Purchased over $7,000 in merchandise last week and couldn't even get Nathan to smile. My husband does not want to go back or refer them business. Nathan comes across like he's put out to help customers. Watched him speak to a gentleman that was waiting for truck to pull up and take his stove and fridge. Nathan was so unfriendly.  Hire happy staff to help your customers!!

Seems like nice Salon but too bad they talk behind your back in Vietnamese and laugh. They don't realize I know some of their language growing up in Orange County. They shouldn't talk about their customers behind their back. Van. First and last visit.

Every sandwich is the BOMB! AMAZING homemade sour dough bread. I would suggest they use albacore for their tuna but other than that everything is super fresh. Best sandwich shop in the West Valley!

We received a full confirmation for a vehicle at their Glendale location and am now finding out they don't have a car available but found one 20 miles away at double the cost we were quoted!

Very good Italian food!! Don't waste your time standing in line downtown Phx for over an hour for even better pizza here. Lasagna, speghetti...everything is packed with flavor. They may want to make sure the music is suitable for the setting of romance or family dinners...one day a staff member had rap on. Will come back though!

Two stars are due to the horribly dirty shop they keep here. We went with a group around 8pm, store open until 10. The mirror was dirty with old yogurt, floors a mess, the guy was already hosing out two of the units so TWO flavors not available. Water going everywhere, cleaning it with a seemed to be VERY dirty brush in front of customers. GROSS!  Countertops and tables sticky. Ugh..They do have great quality yogurt but this last visit grossed us out on how dirty everything was. All the other posts are correct about this location. The owner needs to wake up to these complaints!

Our family and friends have been going to this Chipotle location for awhile but the quality of food has changed and portions have gotten smaller. The staff is slow and fajita veggies are greasy now. Chicken is half fat pieces. Sad that it's changed so much and they're trying to cut corners which will eventually shut them down.

Horrible service and junk food. The staff has been poorly trained or management doesn't care this place will go out of business very soon. Our whole group went after work and didn't have anyone even ask if we wanted drinks for 30 minutes after our arrival. Party of 16!

The specialty brownies are amazing, heath bar cake balls, buttermilk pie! She's very talented and will customize your order. One of the best bakeries in all of Glendale/Phoenix! Cool downtown area.

What happened to Golden Spoon that was here in Surprise? Guess they're only in the "East Valley"..Scottsdale etc. Now that's QUALITY frozen yogurt. This yogurt is very icy, meaning they've added too much water to the mixture to save money. Compare this to Golden Spoon and you'll see the difference. Better quality for the price and amount of yogurt at GS. Won't be back here...

Nothing different about their mani/pedi other than the price...too expensive for the same type of outcome at other nail salons. When theres a nail salon on every corner, train your techs to be customer service oriented! Could tell the girl couldn't stand her job, never smiled once. Super unfriendly! Won't be back.

Don't go to the Glendale/Peoria location. Machines are old, dirty and employees were just sitting around. Zero customers, yogurt melted within a few minutes. Over four dollars and wasn't even 1/2 to the top. Very artifical flavor. Please put in a Golden Spoon in Glendale!! Much better quality, quantity and  customer service.

First technician started the eye exam. After about 10 minutes into it he told me he would start dilating my eyes..I asked how long should I wait to drive as I wasn't prepared for this and haven't had my eyes dilated in years. Told me it would be fine to drive right after leaving. He continued to put more drops in 10 minutes after the first set. A Dr. Jacobsen came in to finish exam and immediately started pushing surgery!! I asked for my prescription and he told me it wouldn't be completed until I see the surgeon who wasn't available for seven more weeks. He literally refused to finalize my prescription. Not enough time in the day to continue the dialog I had with Derek Jacobsen. I've never experienced anything like this in my life. He was unprofessional and quite rude. Even with very dark sunglasses on I couldn't even walk to my car in the sunlight. Had to call my son to come pick me up. Horrible experience, the worst in all the years at an Optometrist.

Great atmosphere, crowd and music! Food has always been quite a bit better than most bars. Even the salad was great. Wonderful staff and great service. Will definitely be back. Perfect spot for happy hour with co-workers on the outdoor patio. Advise..fire up the outdoor smoker/bbq's!

Great food but HORRiBLE service. place was dead. We frequent the Scottsdale location so this was our first time at the Biltmore location. The server was out of control hyper and was very condescending! The service and professional attitude from the staff in Scottsdale is much better. Very fake when you first walk in. Sean .. Our server was very very rude! Will not be back.

Unfortunately the quality has gone down quickly. Great location, friendly staff but even their eggs are very watery, super low end quality. Our friends had pancakes that were under cooked and super tough from the cook over mixing the pancake batter. Love the to go cups for their coffee though.  Not sure if we'll be back.

Pretty good quality and selection here! The owner needs to watch the ratio of servers and prime time dinner period. Did have one bad experience when it took over 40 mins to receive our meal. The salad @ $12 should have greens though..not iceberg lettuce!  Sandwiches and fries are very tasty.

Only one employee knows what he's doing. The other three stand there and have Ross answer all their customers questions. They need to hire helpful employees. Took three hours to just set up two new phone lines.

On our first visit to this restaurant, we had brought our whole family. Loved the atmosphere! Food was just alright. Very stale, dry chicken. Soup is definitely from a can! 2nd visit was for breakfast...the biscuit was the driest biscuit I've ever had. It was almost laughable! Terrible customer service. Owner was very annoyed when my husband told him we didn't want the biscuit lol. Won't be back!

Nice Surprise in Glendale!!!~Very nicely updated bar with plenty of space, great flat screen TV's, shuffle board and pool tables. What a difference from the bar that had been here for years. Completely different atmosphere!! Small live bands on the weekends. Great place to bring your co-workers after a long week. Amazing FOOD! Friendly servers.

Unfortunately,  the service has been horrindous the last two times. Tonight much worse than that! Party of six, no service for over 25 mins literally  sitting there. Off crowd as well! We all walked out! Done! Won't be back. Plenty of other tables very annoyed they hadn't received their drinks or food.
