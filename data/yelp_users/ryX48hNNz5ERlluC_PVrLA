We went for breakfast here while on vacation, although I didn't pick the place, I had heard good things but found it to be ok (I prefer to visit non-chains). It reminds me of any other breakfast at any other diner that isn't really memorable or great. I had the eggs benedict but whatever they called the version with avocado. It was ok, a nice change from regular eggs benedict but not as good as the menu seemed to make it out to be. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food just fine (they got salads or some skillet things).   Overall the wait wasn't too bad, I didn't care for unattended children running around and the service could've been better (I waited forever before I got my coffee, and I'm not happy until I've had my coffee fix). I'd say its ok, but I don't plan on ever going back.

This mall is nice and seems to have just about every store I like to shop at. It's a mall, like most indoor malls but larger with more stores to shop at. I can't say I really saw anything there I couldn't find in Chicago (although to be inside and not on Michigan Ave in the freezing cold was a nice change of pace for winter shopping).

It's like most family fun places, but seems to have a lot more. It had miniature golf, batting cages, go karts, bumper boats, arcade games *and* sand/beach volleyball and a driving range. The best part? The automatic tees that come up with your ball and the fact the balls load themselves. No more carrying around a bucket for the truly lazy ;) Overall it seemed pretty clean as well.  I didn't eat there so I can't say much on the food.

We stayed here while in Scottsdale, and it was very nice. The room was nice, had shiny new flatscreen tvs (although no HDTV). It was also comfortable and we had a full kitchen which was nice. The Asada restaurant was good, having a breakfast buffet I visited a couple of times. We also took advantage of the heated pools and jacuzzis (it was great they had multiple ones of each). Sadly I didn't try out the gym or the other places to eat, but maybe someday I'll go stay there again :)

We went to the recently opened new location, which didn't have the sandwiches but I guess had more pastas? We had the rush street (pepperoni) pizza and the one with sausage for appetizers. I had the lobster ravioli which was really good. Everyone else enjoyed their food, all got a variety of dishes.   The downside was it was newly opened, they didn't get our reservation call from this location (we went to this location and they called the new location for us and put us on the list and the hostess was not at all nice about this) and so we waited *forever* (a good 45min) in a packed place that had no sitting area (the bar of course was full). Also we sat between the kitchen and the waitstaff area so I got to listen to the complaints and drama of the waitstaff. I get places are new, but try to *look* professional even if you can't do your job.
