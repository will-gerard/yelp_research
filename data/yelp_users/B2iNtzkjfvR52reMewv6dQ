Came here on Friday night for a friends bday. Been hearing great things about this place and we just had to try it out for ourselves.  Place: Pretty modern. Decor was nice and the place in general was pretty dim. We made reservations but don't think you really need to at this place unless you have a big party or it's a packed holiday. We got sat a booth and for some reason, there was a portrait of a sad looking cow right above us (still ate steak with no shame though).   Service: 5 stars. Waiter was super friendly and explained the menu. Had multiple people come by asking how we were doing including the manager.   Food: 5 stars. Was gonna get the a5 wagyu but lebron lost me money...so I decided to get the domestic wagyu New York strip. It was a perfect size and seriously cut like butter, SO DELICIOUS. For comparison, my friend got the t-bone and it tasted like he got it from Denny's after eating the wagyu. We got a few sides, I'd recommend the yukon puree and risotto. We also got the asparagus which was alright. Basically long story short : you're already here, GET THE WAGYU.   Only annoying thing was the person that came by to take pictures of us then tried to charge us 25 bucks for a copy. The person wasn't annoying just the theme park feel of that. But besides that, everything else was great, will be coming back to try the other wagyu cuts.

If you like BBQ, this is probably the best place I've been to in phoenix.   If you have ever been to Lucille's BBQ in California or tempe it is comparable. Been there about 5 times and everything is good. They have large group deals making it pretty cheap. Also right when you walk in you see a donut making machine, and they give you donuts when you finish your meal which is awesome. Freshly baked and very fluffy.   I come back often

This buffet is so underrated in my opinion. Someone in our group recommended this place and I was super surprised at how good it was! I've been to almost every buffet in vegas like wicked spoon at cosmo, bacchanal at ceasars, the buffet at the wynn, etc...and this one was as good if not better than the others! (yes I'm a fatty and proud of it).  Service: Doesn't really matter at a buffet because you serve yourself. In my opinion, my service was excellent, so no complaints. Got up and got food real quick. BUT if you want to be nitpicky, it did take a little while to get seated when the line was short, then it again our group was 18 deep so understandable.  Food: SO MUCH FOOD. The food wrapped around the whole room and it seemed to be endless. So many different food stations. As with all buffets, there was a crab leg section but no lame shortages here, it always seemed to be full of crab legs and no super long lines for it. When I do buffets I like to take a small bite out of every dish, and even doing this I couldn't eat everything I wanted because there was just too much food. Everything tastes fresh and delicious too. And finally there was FREE beer and wine. Not just cheap beer either, it was a house IPA, Heineken, and some other beer that I can't remember; probably because i had too many IPAs and Heinekens.   Place: Upscale, clean, and tons of space. Plenty of room around you to eat and not feel like anyone near you is judging you.  One of the best buffets in vegas in my opinion. PROTIP: Do buffet for lunch instead of dinner so you don't feel terrible about yourself on those vegas nights.

I was referred here by my professor and I was not disappointed. It was great quality, good atmosphere, and definitely affordable for lunch. They give midwestern students a discount and their lunch pasta portions are a steal. It would get a full 5 stars if they had a larger selection of sandwiches. But I definitely come back here often

More meat please! Came here for a big bachelor party and had a pretty enjoyable experience.  Place: seemed to have an old school steakhouse vibe. Classic designs and we got our own private room. We had a huge group of 18 people and they didn't charge extra for the room or have any minimum purchase per person like other steakhouses did. They even accommodated moving our reservation back 30 minutes and us arriving about 10 minutes late after that (some of us may have been tired from some Vegas activities...) One complaint was that the music was a little loud, we asked them to turn it down and they gladly did.  Service: awesome! 5 stars. Both the waiters were very personable and helpful. The main waiter took time to explain the whole menu. They joined in on some conversation and made it a great experience. They were very quick to seat us, zero complaints here.  Food: 3 stars. I have a thing for trying ribeyes at different steakhouses and this lands somewhere in the middle. It is a huge portion but I think it seemed a little bland and dry. I didn't get any rubs, just the steak. I would probably opt for an enhancement or cajun next time. We pretty much got all the sides on the menu and those were great. I really liked the lobster mac & cheese (if you like it creamy) and mushrooms (great companion to the steaks). They also gave complimentary bread that was in a caprese style which was delicious.   Also you can't beat the location of this place, right on the strip and you don't have to walk through a hotel to get there. You can get dropped off right at the front in case you're strapped for time. Overall a great experience. Top notch service, and while the steak wasn't the best I've ever had, everything else was superb.

I just randomly found an optometrist when I moved here and this was the first place i found. I thought it looked really nice and had a great ambiance. The eye exam itself went fine.  What I didnt like was that it seemed overpriced, over 130 dollars for the exam even with insurance. That part didnt bother me that much but they said for an extra 30 or so dollars they would take a special image of my eye and determine my eye health. I agreed and they took the image. When the Dr. came he basically just said, your eye is fine. He wouldn't have even mentioned it if I didn't ask about the image. It seemed like he didn't care at all and it just really turned me off

Definitely not the nicest looking cleaners but they get the job done. Relatively inexpensive and they give a discount to Midwestern Students.  I actually got power steering fluid stains on some wool pants and a dress shirt (don't ask me how) and I thought I would have to throw them away. I brought them in to the cleaners, took them an extra day but they got the stains out perfect. Cheap, quick, and efficient. All you are really looking for in a cleaners

This place was great.  I went on a sunday for brunch. I thought it was going to be small judging from the outside but it turned out to have a surprisingly big. Really good atmosphere especially upstairs. They had piano music playing and I actually wasn't sure if someone was playing live. I don't think there was.  Food was delicious. I got the biscuits with gravy. Potatoes were definitely unique and great. Drinks were also very refreshing. Will be back many times in the future

Just like everyone said, this place is loud.  So I went on a date here and it actually helped. My date had to sit next to me for us to even carry a conversation so that was nice. The service was good, our waiter was very sociable and had many suggestions. Now to the food.  We got the pretzels with cheese and honestly, I prefer the mall pretzels with cheese. The salmon was also only okay. The drinks were refreshing but I was really turned off by how dark and loud the place was. Was definitely over hyped for me, probably wouldnt go back

From an actual Vietnamese person:  So we were in the mood for pho/vietnamese food so we decided to check this place out since it was recommended. Looked like a small home from the outside and pretty modern looking when we went in. For appetizers we ordered the fried spring rolls which were actually very small (bascially 2 rolls) and just meh. I ordered the pork banh mi and it was terrible. Probably the worst banh mi I've had, and I've had some bad ones. Tiny bit of pickled vegetables when it needed way more and the pork was poorly cooked and seasoned. Didnt taste like banh mi at all. My friend ordered the pho tai which was okay, definitely order the larger portion which just seemed like normal size. Don't know how small the small size must be.   Service was also poor, Not a lot of people there and they took their sweet time, seriously just talking to each other at the bar. It was hard to get their attention with the way the restaurant was set up.  If you have never tried pho before, definitely don't go here as there are many other good places in the phoenix area like pho thanh

I really like this place. But to be honest, Ive only gone on a sunday and a monday. Seemed like our group was the only one in the theatre   The place is very nicely designed, you can just feel how modern it is when you walk in. Tickets are not anymore expensive then going to a regular theater. Got a beer which was around 6 dollars, not too expensive considering it is a movie theatre. I ordered a grilled chicken burger with sweet potato fries and it was surprisingly delicious. The fries seemed like it was unlimited, couldn't even finish all the food I had.  Leather seats were comfortable and service was polite. Overall a great experience

This is place is awesome.   So they revamped this place this past year and definitely for the better. So i got a taco, 3 rolled tacos w/ guacamole, and a tostado for 5 bucks! 10% discount to midwestern students. Everything was delicious! (but maybe not the healthiest). Also a bag to tortilla chips alittle over a dollar for a huge bag.  Only problem is that this place isnt open 24 hours.
