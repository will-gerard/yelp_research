Ideal small, intimate resort with stellar service!  They earned my repeat business.  If you're looking for a large, 5 start Ritz Carlton, go to the Ritz.  If you're looking for a gorgeous setting with a Tuscan vibe, gardens, fountains, nooks crannies and one-on-one service it's ideal.  It's not perfect, but as a frequent traveler it wins in my book!  Resort fee covers all tips - not a usual perk!  Employees still go above and beyond.  Michael S. In valet, Robert and Matt at pool all extraordinary.  We didn't want for anything.  Parking is $15 for one vehicle but only a one time fee and you can go in and out.  This is also a deal for resorts.  We had a travel zoo voucher and were on a tight budget so we used food credits in Mix up Bar.  Great wine, good food but very limited and neither Mix Up or TJ Cooks good for vegans.  TJ Cooks well known and smelled delicious and I'll eat there next time when not on budget travel.  Pool great, but smaller so reserve chairs early.  We never waited for service or water or towels!  These are the perks of smaller property!  Water was very cold but would be good in hotter weather.  Hot tub was too hot to use.  Since we were on a budget we didn't get to use our $40 spa credits because it was limited to massage or body work for 50min or more.  We did get to do free yoga class which was awesome!  Will be better outside when bugs aren't biting.  We also got to use steam room (even though we didn't get services - another perk of smaller property.)  Spa smaller but luxurious with amenities, steam room, showers, small private hot tub women only, and good lotions.  My only complaints were room service dishes all over property and not picked up despite employees out and about.  And better vegan food options.  That sent us off property to close restaurants.  Either way I'll be back.  Rooms were great, romantic, big beds, robes, big bathroom, dressing room, separate bag area and nice showers.  Check for tub if you want to take a bath.  Don't hesitate... great place!

I loved it here!  Great atmosphere, comfortable setting and tasty food!  The menu is small but quality and the taste was amazing!  It seems to wrap an urban, uptown, outdoor patio with fireplace vibe all in one!  I had the Hanger steak with green mashed potatoes and asparagus.  AWESOME.  Friends had the chicken and salmon and both delicious!  The warm goat cheese appetizer is a MUST!  Service was excellent and I'll be back soon and refer!

I've used Flyers Direct several times and have never been disappointed.  This week they went above and beyond with customer service!  I picked up a batch of 1,000 postcards that printed terrible due to my poor graphics.  I had the SAME postcard in the que to print 5,000.  Robert Davis saved the DAY!  They stopped the print and he went out of his way to improve the graphics.  He was in full communication with me every step of the way.  He did a stellar job and gave me a product I could never have imagined!   The team got the cards printed in record time!  I haven't experienced that kind of customer service in a long time.  This office works hard, tows the line, delivers and on top of it all does it with QUALITY.  They have my business!  I highly recommend!!

Hmmm... this place looks FABULOUS and I can't get anyone to answer a phone or connect to schedule anything.  I'm not sure if you're still open for business?  The phone only disconnects to a fax line.

Service is never the best here, but they have good clean flank salad & great happy hour prices. Martinis smaller, but for $5 you can have two! Great Queso dip that is half off until 7.  Great patio if you can tolerate smokers & or music playing on stage. When it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's BAD!

Nice treat for Saturday lunch with big 50% off menu. A lot of the sushi is fried or with cream cheese but they totally accommodated my special orders in effort to eat healthy.  If you drink ginger martini's are delicious!

Love this place & have eaten here for 4 years! Best chicken Greek salad in Phoenix. High quality meat if you eat it. Excellent hummus & baba ghanouij and a pink garlic sauce that you will crave!  Servings are large, feta is fresh if you like cheese & they have the good thick pita's. They cater to your order & the cooks greet you with a smile... At least they do me because I'm in all the time!  Hidden in a strip mall behind Best Buy on the west side it's not easy to discover. They have opened a second location in Tempe Marketplace!

Just come here!  This place OOZES sexy!  I am sure it will be 5 stars when I eat a full meal... but for now the ambiance, fresh made guacamole, champagne and SEXY environment has me wanting more!  Great patios, service, people and ALWAYS packed.  Reservations required unless you want to be smashed at the bar... I don't mind it's worth the visit!  LOVE this place and on my list of ideal romantic dinner places!

What a lucky amazing find!  Hegel Yoga Studio and Tish are a hidden gem!  I've been doing yoga for 3 years at home, video, random spa classes, workshops and the gym.  I wanted more options than the gym and bought a coupon online to try the studio.  Her studio offered so much variety and 2 months unlimited yoga it's almost robbery for what I paid.   It cost less than a meal out for one!  This yoga has changed me forever!  The second month is brilliant because now I'm hooked.  From the first moment I walked in Tish greeted me, got to know me and learned my name.  She is welcoming every time and knows her people.  The studio has a great vibe.  I've tried almost every class at every time and there is a flux of people and regulars.  She is consistent and hands on, and so welcoming!  The cool thing, is it doesn't matter who you are or what you need you get it here!  Tish is an AMAZING teacher and wealth of information.  I've learned more about yoga in 1 month than I have in 3 years.  She also makes you feel good no matter what level you're at, is hands on with adjustments, reminds you it's your practice and it doesn't matter if you can bind yourself into a pretzel or barely touch the floor - you will fit in.  AND you'll get what you need!  Sometimes it's hot in the studio and can be crowded  in some classes, but usually once the flow goes the rest of the world disappears.  She always has great music and tons of props.  You learn how to use props just like you learn how to honor your body!  Chairs, blankets, blocks, straps, sandbags...   I'm sold and I've been telling everyone!  Tish knows so much you are guaranteed to up your level and abilities no matter where you're at.  Gifted teacher and she's so down to earth!    A MUST TRY!

This is the best, secret most awesome place in town for a foot massage!  They go way beyond that for incredible prices.  My mom and I go all the time... Tony is my guy and he will work out any kink.  You can't worry about your hair or makeup and its very similar to a Thai massage, but clothed and in a chair.  AWESOME!

Whitehouse is a great bar/dance/social venue in Scottsdale!  My business partner and I (www.socialseduction.com) hold social groups here regularly with great success!  We have never gotten anything less than VIP service from Managers, doormen and servers!    It offers open, airy environment that really is white with black and white couches and seating that is perfect for groups.  The dance area is big enough but does get crowded on busy nights.  It's easy to walk around, mingle and you'll find a great mixed crowd!  There is the standard college-Scottsdale clubbers, but you'll also find a wide variety of ages in both sexes and many professionals!  The most challenging thing I find is parking (but this is true of downtown Scottsdale on a weekend anyway) and if they had Valet, I'd use it hands down!  My only wish is a full length mirror in the ladies room!  We can't see our shoes which is a cardinal sin!  Anton, the GM has been superb to work with and we will continue promoting this great venue!    All I have left to try is food and suspect I can bump this to 5 stars!!

I don't know about the hotel, but I enjoyed the erotic red bar!  Deep velvet red couches, outdoor fire, and good music!  It was sexy and inviting...

This is a true wellness healing center! Nestled in a perfect location, with several surrounding eatery's it's a gem!  I went in with a level 8 pain in shoulder, hips and lower back from old motor vehicle accidents, etc.  I've tried EVERYTHING including 2 chiropractic procedures under anesthesia and still have pain.  In one session with Jesse my pain dropped to a 2 and gets better by the day.  Jesse brings so much love, knowledge and intuitive talent it's almost indescribable!   With all his powerful modalities, cupping, aromatherapy, body work, energy etc. you get exactly what you need.    Jesse knows what your body needs even if you don't.  He is bringing health to individuals and the community with his center.  Workshops, smoothies, community, healing... it's ALL here!  I'd chill, work or hang out in his lounge any day over Starbucks!  His team is just as loving, caring and energetic.  I've known Jesse for years and never came to him for services!  Now I'll never go anywhere else for massages and healing work.  Don't wait... your health is too precious!

I LOVE this place!  The owner Steve, rocks!  It's an eclectic mix of 1950's antiques, movies in the background, boxing ring, outdoor patio, unique clothes line and forthcoming "Pie Hole" for fresh pies!  He has a blend of everything for everyone and the atmosphere is local, urban, energetic, and tons of space!  Food and drinks are excellent and Steve talks to everyone!  If that isn't enough, go on a Sunday for his Punch & Crunch Brunch!  That is a workout you won't forget and work up an appetite for a great brunch!  You aren't a Phoenix Hipster unless you've been here!

This is the BEST experience I have ever had buying eye glasses!  The doc was great but Tammy made the experience!  She understood my plight of not wanting progressives and yet being able to read!    She had glasses picked out for me when I got out.  When that shape didn't work she jumped up and had 5 more of exactly what I wanted.  She picked the first pair and after less than 5 minutes it was a done deal!  I have NEVER picked glasses that fast!  The special two-focal lens she suggested is working SUPERBLY!!    I'm so happy and will go here from now own with or without a Groupon!  Super service, fast and easy!

Awesome little Greek place!! I just moved in across the street & scored with this being my favorite food! I could live on hummus and theirs ROCKS!! The jalapeño hummus is superb! Best I've ever tasted & plain is excellent but has lots of garlic. Which is good for some & some not... I loved it!! Falafel is obviously homemade vs. Pasty mix. To go order was fast, easy & Christian gave great friendly reception!! Inside very nice, clean cut & a bit above average strip mall casual! Outdoor seating available. I'll be a regular...  Check them out!!  I would give 5 stars if they had Babaganoush!!

This was my first visit and it was a great experience for Father's Day!  I did my Yelp due diligence but always expect the best.  We did a 5pm early dinner, so it was a slow, Sunday holiday afternoon and a shame considering the amazing Father's Day menu.    As a Vegan its not my kind of food, but I found plenty to eat and they offer GF, V, VG.  But for my Dad it was perfect!  Crazy special menu for Dad's with to die for beer mustard!  I'm surprised I didn't find that advertised anywhere when searching for what to do in Phoenix for Father's day.  Shame!  We were served right away in the bar and got attentive service right to the dinner table.  Our dinner waiter Chris was excellent and talked us through the whole menu.  We didn't want for anything, he took us all the way to then end with a to die for dessert.  Environment, ambiance, layout, vibe & view... all excellent!  You can Valet park with hotel and they validate it down to $5 + tip.  Based on reviews the Tater Tots and cauliflower were excellent as reviewed!  The bacon is inside the tater tots not on side, but both are a must.  The grilled broccoli was good, but nothing special.  We shared all that and Summer Panzanella - with grilled fruit and cornbread and it was good but it wouldn't bring me back.  The waiter, cauliflower and dessert would!  But plenty more to try on menu.  Father's day menu was incredible and unique from Pate, beer mustard, pickled cauliflower, pork chops, onion gravy, 3 drinks ales to Scotch and literally a "root beer" float made with ice cream and ale beer!  Upon waitor's recommendation I ordered the upside down pineapple cake and it literally melts in your mouth... incredibly delicious!  All in all a very good experience prices from $5 - $50 on menu!  So works for everyone, great venue for business, nice occasional dinner, drinks, date, happy hour.  Definitely worth a visit!

Good food - reminds me of a Green only with more options & urban flare. Great location small inside but worth wait for seating!  Numerous vegetarian or vegan options.

I have been using the family owned business for over 7 years and continue to get extraordinary service!  They were a referral from a friend and did not disappoint landscaping my empty yard or for 5 years with regular service.  I have referred them out and everyone was more than pleased.  Now I'm in a rental and they continue to go above and beyond with care, more than fair pricing, quality work and trustworthy crews.  Katrina is fabulous to work with and her husband Himey does miracle fixes!  You can go wrong supporting this local, family owned business who works hard, backs up their quality and cares about their customers.  I highly recommend!

I can't believe I just found 24 Carrots! I had heard... But not seen. They are still waiting for City of Tempe to approve sign. HURRY! People that eat well need to find you! A TRUE Vegan (not GF) kitchen. Spacious & open, with a fresh casual vibe.   Great menu options that are based on local farmed foods for the week. Prices reflect quality - a little higher for healthy, fresh & local but worth it & fair! Portion sizes are great, food display, quality DELICIOUS!  I had a bowl of beet soup, 1/2 BLT with vegan tofu (non GMO) bacon & sunflower seed Tu-no salad!!! Lavender & Hibiscus tea... With tip $22 out the door but taking all the salad with me.  The owner comes out & met the crowd asked questions etc. I would give 5 stars but "waitress" sluggish & hum-dee-dum. It could use a good cleaning. Floors dirty, windows, fingerprints on glass cases. A hardworking server could be managing that. I'll be back for food!

Loving Greek food as much as I do I returned to give this new venue a second shot.  While the environment is GREAT for working, free wifi music (80's Rock that day) and spacious, the food doesn't cut it.  I ordered a basic greek salad, my friend a gyros and we had a hummus appetizer.    The first hummus tasted spoiled, the kind when you put it in your mouth it fizzes.  I eat hummus almost daily and I'm hard to please but fresh is key.  They did replace it with no hassle but it didn't start things well.  For the high prices it was a lackluster salad,  lettuce unassuming, unripe tomatoes and dressing that tasted like it was from a bottle.  For the price I expected a much higher quality salad, not a cheap diner salad.  The gyros plate was just as unimpressive.  Second visit the staff was pretty and either brand new and didn't know anything or not well trained.  We got what we needed but service could overlook the high prices and so-so quality.    I'm vegan so I can't eat much else, but if you want a quick meal, a place to work it's good.  And they just opened so much of this may work out!!  I will have to be REALLY hungry to go again but would have a meeting here.
