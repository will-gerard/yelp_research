We've ordered delivery from Pizza Heaven before and we loved it! We also love that they offer gluten free. But this time around, it was not great. We ordered two medium pizzas online at 5:59pm with an estimated delivery time of 6:53pm. At 7:15, our pizzas weren't here yet. I called in at 7:22 and asked for an update (I've worked in a pizza joint before and understand that delivery times can be off a bit). The woman who answered the phone told me that my order left the restaurant a couple of minutes ago. She never apologized.  At 7:45, our pizzas weren't here yet. We live 10 minutes away. I call back and ask for a manager. The same woman answered and asked how she could help. I explain the situation and mentioned I called earlier. She puts me on hold (again, without apologizing). The owner, Patricia, comes on and, without apologizing, blames their computer system and said that it says I ordered at 6:53. I pointed out that my email confirmation shows 5:59 and the 6:53 she is referring to is my estimated delivery time. So either it's an honest mistake or she doesn't know how to read her own computer system. She THEN shifts the potential blame to her drivers for possibly delivering it to the wrong house and proceeds to tell me that they probably wouldn't admit to it (who tells a customer this?????!?!?!?).She says they are busy which I totally understand on a Saturday night. But just tell me that. I don't need to know how you feel about your staff. It's not professional and that is between you and them, not your customers.   In the end, I ask for compensation and she said they can't give me a refund because of their system? Um, its 2016 right? She tells me that my pizzas are in the oven and they will be right out the door as soon as they are ready and offers me a single, free pizza on my next order, any size, any pizza. THEN, after 2 calls, and 7 minutes, I get my first apology. It would have been nice to get my same order free next time since a refund apparently couldn't be given.   I'm sincerely hoping this is a one-time issue because we have enjoyed their pizza in the past.

UPDATE: Patricia, the owner personally reached out to me after reading my review from 2 weeks ago and apologized for what happened and my experience. She offered to come our next meal if we would give her another chance.   I called last night to order 2 large pizzas and asked for Patricia. She remembered who I was and again sincerely apologized. She also better explained their computer system as to why she couldn't give me a refund and it made more sense. It's because they use GrubHub, a 3rd party transaction system.   She kept her word to comp our entire meal and we ordered a Margherita and Miko Miko, both larges. She apologized again and even rushed our order. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and the delivery driver was at our door by 7:15.   I appreciate owners who own their business in more ways than one. She definitely did and I'm satisfied with calling our previous experience with Pizza Heaven a "one off."

Ordered a triple Americano. I was impressed by the fact that it only cost $3.05 for a triple. Especially when places like Lux or Lola are $3 for a single. But then I found out why. The triple Americano was served in a 12oz cup and was really weak for being a triple. And while it was hot, it didn't seem as hot as it should have been. I am concluding that either my Americano did not have a triple shot OR there was too much water. I'm leaning toward the former given that even a REAL 12oz triple shot would taste stronger despite the 12oz cup.   On top of this, when I asked the woman at the counter if the drink was mine or not, she had to ask the barista but only after she put her hand all over the cup and even the lid. Who does that?  She was very talkative but casually mentioned that their old barista was fired, yes fired. I did not inquire about the old barista, and didn't even know there should be an old barista, let alone thought I needed to know why they were no longer there. Professional, much?  I'm hoping this was just a bad first experience so I will go back because it's the only local coffeehouse by my work that isn't Starbucks or fast food. But if my next trip is like this first one, it will be my last.

My first time at Windsor but we love Upward Projects and we've been to the other spots except this one. So we knew it would be good.  And it was.  Showed up on a Friday at 7pm and for a table for 3 right away. Service was fast and our server was very knowledgable about their beers and that helped me try some new ones I have never had before.   We split the fondue that came with apple slices, soft pretzels slices and sausage slices. It was good however the sausage was more like salami. It was still meat but I was expecting nicely sliced grilled sausage links.   I got the porkwich for the main dish and it was amazing. Three different cuts of pork with an amazing sauce and cole slaw to go with it. I appreciated the fact that the server brought out my next beer with my main dish. The timing was a nice touch.   The other 2 in our party enjoyed their meals except for the fact that they asked for their burgers to be served on a bed of greens since they didn't do lettuce wraps and they were served as normal on buns. They are both gluten free by choice so they didn't fight it.   Good food. Good ambiance. Good ice cream next door at Churn for dessert.

Our fridge started to leak and we are big on using local businesses. Being new to the area, we saw that Appliance Works is not only local, but family owned and operated. Two workers showed up, on time, one was there to train because their business is growing so fast. They quickly identified the issue and I got to watch the experienced worker train the other first hand, not in some classroom. The time and care he took to teach the other one speaks volumes of how they do business. They were done within 45 minutes and it was only $90! They took their time with clean up, ensuring our floor was dry and things were back as they found them. They knew we would be looking to get a new fridge down the road and they spent time discussing brands and styles so that we would be more informed when that time comes. They take card/check.   If you're looking for an opportunity to support a local business when your appliances need help, give these guys a call. It is no wonder their business is flourishing.

This place is the unhealthy equivalent of Hillside Spot Cafe!  Their brews are top notch. They also have Descutes' Black Butte Porter which I recommend.   We had wings: Dark Ale BBQ and Sea Salt and Peppercorn Grind; I recommend the latter!

My wife and I wanted to dive back into sushi after a bad experience at another location in the Valley. We went here with friends that recommended it. We ordered the California roll, philly roll and Las Vegas roll and all 3 were delicious!  We will not only go back here often but we'll continue to expand our sushi horizons because of how good this was.

First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!  The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu.   This will be a regular spot for ushering forward. It is better than Postino (with way better parking too) but not as close to us. But very worth the drive. We didn't even play corn hole but it was readily available!
