At glance was looking clean and nice i said when we check in because it was  After getting something to eat i sat on the bed and bugs jumped on me . Small black fleas . Alive . I put a few in a cup , then began to look at the bed, pull all covers off, bugs, chips snd wood things under all the covers. My husband call front desk, -a person came looked all he ssid was "not good, housekeeping arent doing their jobs" He told us he was off in 5 mins,but he would get someone on it .Hour later still in the room, no one came to help, my husband again called, yes this was last night writting it this morning , i was to upset last night .  After calling them, they said they would send a person to help , now two hours still nothing , .my husband walked to front desk, demanded a new room , got it. They gave him a use of a golf cart , to get our things to one room to the next , it died , we moved ourselves to new room 4 hours later , no help, no sorry,   The new room was clean, no bugs, ..  So when checking in here make sure and check carefully

This place is a 5 star and beyond , I would really give it a 10 star if I could . Came in from AZ to celebrate our wedding anniversary of 25 years .  All the way from my phone conversations to walking in the door this place was outstanding, they helped with all the right design to making us feel very comfortable. It's clean , they took care of everything up front and honest,talking to us right through everything .the front of the staff was so funny , engaging helpful thanks Joey . Hopefully that's The right name   We needed someone make my husband relax with getting matching tattoos, first one for my Husband.  , Nick made him feel right at ease, my family all came with , and my Daugther and her boyfriend decided as well to get matching tattoos as well , this was a great  experience ,was able to see everyone at once . We took so many picture going in between rooms and laughing with our artist .  This is really is the best  Thanks again ..    I highly recommend this place , next year we are returning to get more , yes more for my husband ..he's hooked .  Prices good , clean , caring , family like atmosphere, go check them out ,

Wow what a amazing place. Food great big portion and prices are fabulous . Clean /fast. The wait time wasn't that bad , would have waited a hour if it needed to be , it was that good  !!! Get the muffin the best !!everyone is so happy , I would think they are all family , not a sad face around , not one server complained about anyone , we sat right by the kitchen , but they could have a complain spot in the back , lol, that we don't know about .. Our sever Amanda was so helpful , are glass of drinks filled  constantly, food brought out with a smile , very pleasant when taking our orders , Amanda joke with us , and she was busy , took the time to be helpful , thank you !! coming in from AZ , we should have hit this place from the first day , to bad we are leaving .next time here first ,to start our day off right . Head over fast, wish had more stars because that's what they should get 10  of 10

What can I say ?? The best service all around , called Matt the day before showed up , told me exactly what was wrong and went to it . By far the best customer service ever , fast , I'm mean really fast , friendly , and most importantly the price was the best .  I made a few calls before this Company , the  prices all to high , and they acted like they couldn't come  out for a few days ..I highly recommend this place .. I have to admit  I was bad ,and sent him to the wrong house at first , I have  other properties, he was at wrong one , my fault, I told him my correct address, he assured me it wasn't a problem , and came to the right one , he did notice at the other house the  panels are bad , so am I going to call them for this ?? You bet ! If I could give them 10 out of 10 stars I would , call them you won't be disappointed.

Best place ever , food , helpful staff , .sit in side or out. . Outside sitting you have the trees over flowing, so shade areas all around.walking distance to the Farm Stand and Agritopia..plenty of parking walk all around take in the sites.We have veggie burger with sweet potato fries, /ahi tuna salad with cole slaw. Both amazing  veggie burger is so big , never can finish it , and the tuna is cooked to prefection with just the right amount of pink showing,with wasbi dressing just a hint of hotnees , season to let you know its there but not over powering

We didnt have to wait at all. Big menu, was told its new as of 6 months ago.  Lots of food to choose from almost too much to choose from. Huge portion, get ready for doggie bag, left overs are the best.  At the end shared 30 year celebration cheesecake cause we went to celebrate  our 24 yesrs of marriage . Clean, fast , friendly staff , . Best part while waiting for food to come , you get bread hot warm , it will fill you up  Ask gor Jennifer , she was great

Haven't been here in a while ,thinking it was all the same , don't like I have to order my own food now at counter , miss talking to our sever, and now different things on menu . I understand that they own two of these places but the whole reason to come here was because it was so different . . I talked my family to come here today bragging about how different it was , but so disappointed , they eat I didn't ..  Im sure the shock will wear off , and I'm open to change , but ...

Bought it took it home , watery , very thin no taste , , no cheese on top like they use to do ,not sure what happened, maybe they are running out so they added water to it , . We haven't been in awhile ,so maybe changed the recipe, not sure , maybe now it taste like this always , we will wait till we try again .. Otherwise not for us ..

OMG!!! This is what I can say .. Walking in made me so happy , surrounded by all my favorite things 'Elvis' This experience was out of the world , from the Elvis impersonator to the photographer, my dreams did come true , Celebrating  our 25 years of  marriage made it so worth the trip . Everything is honest upfront and very personal. Nothing is held back , walking down the isle with my Elvis made me feel right in the moment  Love how everyone was welcomed in the pictures, part of the ceremony, everyone involved, wish my first wedding was this much fun.  You might think the prices are a little high , but with so much fun , pictures , and laughter , you really can't put a price on it . I would tell all my friends and do tell them to do this , makes it for a very great  day all around . Even our limo driver was great , thanks to everyone involved Last I would give them a 20 thumbs up if I could ..

Food always good ,that's  not the problem , the service is always so slow .we come in at least 1 a month it doesn't matter the time of day , mid day.  ,lunch , dinner ,all the same , today we even had to physically walk and ask our waiter for more chips , salsa , and drinks .and it wasn't even busy , he cashed out tables .. Lol.. Maybe just  laid back attitude , not sure  After food was delivered by someone else after did  our waiter  only came back When both our food was almost gone ,thankful we didn't have problems with it ,  The place is clean , walking in always a hi , get seated right away , big enough place that you don't have to wait long  but just the service  We continue to come back only because of the good  good,hopefully someone reads these

Love this place ,we come here for our once a week date night  love the new menu, and great blonde beer . Was able to get a veggie burger much needed. And it was great , really . Our waiter Gabe was great , took our order with lots of things added and deleted to our order . We start off in the booth then move to the bar , at the bar the girls are always busy but they are always ready to take order fast and friendly

Not so good tonight , I know you all close at 9:30 but we we are there at 9:10 and the food we see In front of us is really not that good to look at , and you won't cook new things is pretty bad , given less about because that's all you have , is just bad customer service . Think we are still paying for that food , a lot disappointed especially I have to cook when I get home because there are still Hungry , makes no sense, the point was to fill them up with hot good food , not cold hardly any food .

I just have to say !! This quickTrip is the best , we only come for tea and gas, but it's not as fast as I like , only because my husband knows everyone who works here so he talks for about 10mins ,,and they talk back , he knows about employee vacations , was just informed that one is going on vacation for a week . Not only clean but really great customer service , to keep us , mostly my husband fix of  tea and employees , keep up the good work  We will be coming back , and yes we already come back like 4 times a day

Looking for a great place to get your nails , toes, facial , gel, acrylic ,and more ? You really need to come here , Katie and others here do the best job.Katie has done my nails for years , I always walk away satisfied , she takes her time, looking at every detail she puts on my nails . I never tell her what I like she knows by getting to know me and her other customers likes and dislikes .Very professional place .never waiting to long, book ahead are walk in , they will fit you in.The prices are great as well.  This place is clean fast and friendly .i would give it more stars if I could , 5 being the best is outstanding , I really love this place .

Always love coming to here , great food low prices , workers are really friendly , but today was really loud workers screaming for Morgan , workers laughing so loud from the back heard them all the way out front ,  people eating actually looking all around to see who was screaming, then one workers yelled to the others to shut up ,if you can put up with that then go. We will try it again later or have it to go

Maybe today wasn't a day to shop here ,I love  frys ,here daily , great food choice , I always find it here  First stop Starbucks, maybe I should have stop here , the girl today was really not friendly at at , granted she was the only one working , taking orders and making them , but really no smile, no hi , just "what's your order"bam here's your drink , can't remember her name but it did start with "V" Then on to shopping for a few things I needed , last stop deli , one other man there , getting his order , lots of workers chatting , that's all good , then one person from the deli looks right at me and says , did you grab a number , well you might do it , I said really , only me and him ,. She wasn't going to help  me unless I had a number , by the look on here face , I walked away ,yes it understand the numbers and I do grab them , but in most  cases they don't even follow the numbers and today wasn't like I was going to get list in the shuffle , It must be to close to Thanksgiving for these workers . I think I will stick together one on combs, they go above and beyond to help out ..

Very disappointed In today's outing . I asked our server Jadyn what was in the veggie burrito, she really didn't know , her answer was 'all veggies ! 'I asked her if it was green peppers , onions , she said yes , I told her apparently what was in it,  When it was delivered it was a bean and cheese , I didn't want that cause I already ordered beans and rice on side . I asked her again where is the veggies in my burrito , I had it cut it half, she looked at it,she said they should be there , looked at it again, said she would ask about the veggies,and added I odered you a veggie  burrito ,at that point she walked away , nothing to help the situation, just walked away . Then came back and asked if I needed a Togo box ? I wasn't eating it .Not really sure what that customer service was , but she didn't have it today , my son even said she was acting like she was out of it , he's 15 and notice . She came back dropped off our check , still no sorry , I'll take it off your bill , can I get you a new one , nothing , charged me and she was done .again very disappointed with this place today , that's why a 1 star, my son did get what he wanted , that's the star.

We always love it here , tonight I have to say wasn't the best .really busy around 8pm, waited a little longer than normal for our server to come get our drink orders. We order food,that  came out fine , minestrone came out a lot salty , breadstick hot and warm, my son order a sampler plate , his cheese sticks came out empty , cheese was on the plate not in breaded cheese sticks (squares). Waitress tried her best to make small conversation . Told us up front that she slammed with tables , at least she was honest . We will continue to come hoping it will get better ..

Ok so must confess the last few times we come  here to  eat , The service hadn't been very good at all . As a matter of fact ,we got our money back, so bad and it was our anniversary that night , couldn't talk to management or our server then cause they were part of the problem ,  Fast forward today ,  such a difference , our server was so on top of things , made us feel right at home , gave great suggestions, laughed with us as well as chatted with us , not just about food  .. We will return like always , because the Food is good , close to home and prices at lunch time is great value for our money .  Cameron thanks for taking such good care of us , you rocked it out , not once did we have to ask for refills on anything . In our book you are waiter of the day , thank you again . You need to get a raise because you deserve it !!!  Looking around it seems things might have changed , the staff all around us was on top of things , even the manger on duty was asking us and everybody how the food was , much much different .

Never eat a McDonalds always stop in for ice tea . I get unsweetened and my son gets sweet , but ever time we go they never have lemons are like today again ran out of sweet tea ,, who runs out of that , why couldn't we pull around the side and wait like everyone else waits for food??  The cashier was ringing us up then took my credit  card and handed it back saying , sorry forgot to tell you we just ran out of sweet tea would you like something else ? My son doesn't drink pop , so no thank you , once again to the drive through . If this happened every once in a while , I would be ok with this , but it seems like it happens a lot for us.. So I'm thinking if I order food , what would happen!! Lol.

Not a good experience, order a veggie burger sub, ask him what the patty is made of he said "don't know " just in freezer without box in plastic bag only , I would like you would know who makes your veggie patty and what it is made to see what was in it , sometime people are  allergic to certain things , I need to know , not helpful at all,  and he wasn't very nice or helpful about wanting to help find out about it .  If working in this field you should know about your food instead of holding up two  frozen veggie patties to my face and say this is it how they come , wow , always amazed how workers really don't know the food .. I do understand your working for money , but a little customer service would be nice as well

Off the charts great service, from first phone call to greeting at the door to the staff to the doctors . Im a big baby when it come to dentists so I needed to come because tooth broke . I was recommend to come here from a friend , said nice , clean , payment plans the whole nine yards , she was right , I left feeling so good .they are very up front about everything , nothing hidden . Will I return for cleans and checks , that's a big YES . Dr.Johnson was excellent talked to me settled me down , told me about everything .i so so recommend this place. I never felt the shot , no pain what's so ever , in the end I have a temporary cap root canal next week, and I can say I not scared at all ..this is by far the best dentist experience I have ever had . If I could rate them higher I would give them a 10.. Next my family is coming in ..

Went to get my Husband hair done at this little stripe mall , need tea , the hair dresser all bragged about this place . I walked in and to my amazement , it was the best kept secret .  They had everything , clean , friendly workers , cute little place , large list of coffees , muffins , cookies . People all sitting chatting in a relaxed atmosphere . Enough tables so not waiting on one if you wanted to sit and wait and drink or eat your food  I will always come here before getting my hair done .

First time here, told to come here from our friends ,it's ok but not the best . Looking around the place its ok looking , floor was a little dirty , chairs are cushioned , waiter was nice enough not really friendly .  We sat down severed right away chips and salsa , green and red , both no taste ,asked for hot one. That was much better , added it to our first ones . The red salsa was to much tomato taste no salt , the green really sweet tasting . When ordering asked the difference between green and green , sauce if one was hotter than the other , he said no just red green coloring .  Food was brought looked good, tasted again like no seasoning . Not the Mexican food we are looking for , my Husband ordered Chili Relleno ,said ok , better with sour cream, I ordered cheese enchiladas, no taste but added their verson of hot salsa we asked for in the beginning , so that took it up a notch .  Other people sitting around us complain about the beans and chips , saying something not good, no more big bowl just a few bean scoops on a plate, also asking for a new basket of chips cause really salty .waiter explain about bowls breaking . Lastly chips tasted like out of the bag,maybe not but these are salty .  No wifi Prices are good Bathrooms really clean  Would be come back not sure , we will wait to see if things change from our friends .

Lets first start off with , we eat mexican food 4 times a week , and the name of this place has nothing to do with mexican , should have guessed . This place is cute, severs are good, chips are good, hot sauce is good, but not chucky.. All that said the food looked good delivered , we all bite in and wow,no taste, blaned , , the cheese enchiladas was so bad couldnt eat them , cheese was melted , but the homemade wrappers under coked, black bean tasted like they opened a can of black beans and poured on the plate, not drained, no spicy, my husband refired beans the same way . We all three couldnt eat our meals , such a disappointment . I guess thats why happy Hour is from 11am-7pm  My feelings are never go in unless your thirsty , not hungery. . So giving it a 1star is pushing it , and thats chips

Eat a lot Here , they are fast even when trainiing someone Which seems like they're training people all the time, I always  get a vegetarian on the multi grain which is really good .,the rest of my family loves the long white bread.we eat here at least three times a week. I have only  had one not so good experience   walking in  they never said hi only because they were hanging out with the workers that were off and they were talking to them but other than that I've always been greeted , It took maybe only three minutes before they Acknowledged me.  All in all a great experience

Just came back for my son , a worker that was eating stood up and re-put her apron over her head wiped her lips and proceeded to take our order . I was going to order something but no thank you , surprised me that my son did cause he wouldn't have if he saw this .  Please wash your hands I don't mind you need a break and lunch but I want clean hands , that's all .  Other than that service was fast and friendly I should have said something to bring it to get attention , but thought one of her workers would have said something since he was looking right at her .  On a side note my son said his sandwich is good line always .

First time here since it opened , and my last , look at the menu before coming , I have a hard time finding anything vegetarian at most places other than salad . Was excited to see veggie sandwich on menu. I asked the person behind counter what veggies was in veggie panini , he was having troubles telling me , ordered anyways ,   When delivered to me was so disappointed , maybe , a couple mushrooms on it , onions and squash , hard to find any veggie at all. it was so thin , had troubles finding  anything other than  bread , a few sprinkles  of feta , a balsamic , a bag of greasy  chips that tasted very old .  Way over price for what I got , 8.00 for nothing .maybe I should stick to salad .  Side note place was clean , friendly ,?lots of bakery things ,now they looked good , never tried them .

Best carpet company ever !!! Really they came out to checkout one of our rentals and we really thought that the carpet was so damaged we needed It removed , boy was I wrong , one pass and the carpets looked new again , no more black spots and they did our couches and table chairs as well . The best service , great prices , fast ,friendly and above all honest . They know what they are talking about , never over charge us, and we've had them back for touch ups and work at our house four more times.

Ok , tried this for the first time today , even though my friends said don't waste your money , but I just had to try for myself , I do know they just opened so wasn't expecting the best of the best .  Upon walking in thought they have a big front desk  way to big , for 1 Person , she asked way  to many questions , up front , dinning room or lounge , then explained each to us . I felt like dinning room cause really only 4 table of people , but lots of free tables , as she took us back , notice a lamp shade on table I actually thought she was going to seat us that table , but no right next to it . Lol. It was clean , understanding the training that goes on , that didn't bother us , just think lots of tables with cloth on them , menus already  on table , my ODC set in thinking if someone spilled something , kids chewing the menus , how do you clean these because never took off our table , no plastic covers ,btw we did spill a little on them .. Our sever was fabulous , thank you Carlos, very good waiter , on top of his game kept coming back to check on us .  We ordered a appetizer, it states "lasagna rolls, "  thought this would come out before our meal , NOT , pizza , salad appetizer all came out as once . And even though it says "rolls " with a "s" it was one for 7.95 , not worth it , pizza was cold , sauce was nothing special , wishing it was , and  cooks forgot a topping on one pizza , told manager he was willing to take it and add it on , but it took so long to get out food we decided not to return it to get it . Carols even came back to show us he had it ordered right but the cooks forgot ,, lol, he even joked about it ..  So will we return ? yes ,we will wait a few months after they get settled in , would love to support our community . Thinking when they have all the kinks out it will be with trying again .. Carols gets our stars .
