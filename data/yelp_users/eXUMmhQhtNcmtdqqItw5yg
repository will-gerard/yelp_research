Holy cow. Words cannot express how grateful I am that a place like this exists in Phoenix. The shop is so lovely, reminds me of a shop you would see in Portland or LA. The staff there are so incredibly kind and sincere and they are all really knowledgeable about botany. There isn't a better flower shop in Phoenix!

So freaking good. The vibe here is really chill. The food is crazy good. I love the breakfast burrito with black beans instead of chorizo (simply because I don't eat meat) but I've heard that people love the chorizo. The coffee is on point here as well!

If you are a professional.. DO NOT USE THIS PLACE. Absolutely appalled by this place. I am a professional photographer and have my work published and displayed internationally and I was treated so poorly there by Mike. He talked down to me as if I was a new photographer! I had originally gone there for some prints and it felt as if he had it out for me. He color corrected my work without permission and then when I pointed out something he was doing in photoshop he asserted to me in a condescending way that he "has been doing this for over 20 years".  Furthermore, he had no idea what type of inks they had for printing and they also didn't have the papers I wanted so I went somewhere else. THE BEST part of all of this is he actually called me today and asked if was going to be sending them files to print and I politely said that I would be using another lab because they had the inks and papers I needed for my exhibition. Instead of responding kindly he told me that I handled everything unprofessionally and then sarcastically thanked me for my business. I can't believe that I experienced all of this. I won't be surprised if this place goes out of business soon.

Amazing. I can't believe how great it is to have a place like this in Phoenix. I love how they source as many vegetables as they can from the local farmers in the area. I love how friendly and knowledgable the staff is. I also love the diversity in this place! Today I met a very talented artist who is married to an incredible architect and they were just sitting right next to me. You never know who you'll meet there! Love this place, seriously! The food, the drinks and the service is amazing! Long Live PPM!

This place is on point. The staff is really friendly and warm. You feel like your part of the short leash family when you're there. My favorite dog is the bear with a veggie dog. So good! I also love that they have great beers on tap! Will definitely come back!

Thought this place was really ghetto at first then a friend told me I had to eat here. I was definitely blown away by the food. This guy makes the best green tamales I've ever had. Will definitely return!

Holy cow... This place is amazing!!! Such a hidden gem! Immediately upon entering you are greeted warmly with some warm home made pita and hummus and tea. We ended up getting the vegetarian couscous and I can't get over how tasty it was. My favorite part food wise was how perfect the potatoes were cooked in the couscous. I also loved the aesthetic inside. It felt like we were in morocco. I also enjoyed ending the meal with a date shake!
