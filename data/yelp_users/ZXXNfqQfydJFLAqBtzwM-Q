I just came back from the candle lighting ceremony at my church for my Greek Orthodox Easter. So Xristos Anesti to all the Orthodox Christians out there. Right before midnight, the church goes black and we all have our candles ready. Then each of our candles gets lit from the person next to us until everyone has a lit candle. The ceremony is so beautiful that I started crying. At that moment when we celebrate Christ rising, I feel so spiritual and close to him. I felt something pass through my body. Another year, another Easter, another beautiful ceremony. Xristos Anesti kai Xronia Polla.

Love this spot. Could be the fact that I live around the corner or could be the spot on food. They have 2 happy hours with $5 dollar apps that are enough to keep you full. I always sit downstairs. I call it my "dungeon". Pretty tricky to get up the stairs after a few cocktails, hence the indoor elevator for the tipsy patron. I always order the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped sea scallops. I take dates here and they all love it. We sit by the fire and it's low key. Great place to just sit and be relaxed. If you go early, hard to find a seat (place is very small) and the service is slow sometimes.

Ok I'm Greek so I'm very picky about so called Greek food. Please tell me the owners are not really Greek. We ordered two Gyros, One souvlaki and one chicken souvlaki. The Gyro's were ok. Nothing special at all. The pork and chicken were pretty disgusting. I'd like to know when supposed Greek food started being spiced with curry. Both pork and chicken were dry. The tsaziki, which is so easy to make, didn't even taste like it was made with yogurt. We ordered the 4 meals but came home to find only 3 fries in our bags. Anyway, sorry but knowing what real gyro and souvlaki should taste like, I can't hardly bear to even give this place the two stars that I did.

The owner responded to this very quickly which is nice and shows he cares. He let me know he is not Greek but it just doesn't change my opinion of the food. Just wanted to let everyone know he did respond asking what he could do to make my experience better.

Wow, I don't see what all the horrible reviews are about. I switched here from LA Fitness and am so much happier. I never received the high pressure sales tactics for memberships or trainers that I did at LA Fitness. I like the layout and it's not overcrowded. Seriously, you get what you pay for. I don't expect a top notch towel service gym for this rate..but....I get the equipment I need, the service I like and have no complaints.

I was so excited to try it because people rave. NOT a fan. I guess if you like super sweet sauce it will be up your alley. I couldn't eat it. I will stick to Joe's pizza or Slice of Sicily, pay much less and enjoy much more.

It's so sad that I have to give this place two stars because of the service. I have never been or even heard of this place till I Googled family friendly restaurants. I saw that you can enter the restaurant on a slide and knew it was a go because the kids would dig that. We walk up and pass a huge stinky cow or ginormous something in the front. Kids were loving it. We walk up to the hostess stand and there are 3 hostesses and a manager standing there. One of them is blowing her nose into a napkin very loudly the whole time we stand there. Um.....aren't there bathrooms for that? My stomach did tiny somersaults of protest. We sit down and our server just sucked. She completely ruined my experience. The view is freaking amazing,. You can see the whole valley. It could have been my little hidden date gem but even that is not enough to lure me back. The server was rude to both my mother and I. She never told us about the specials, she never asked if I wanted my soft drink refilled, she never asked if I wanted dessert....she just plain sucked. Bland, slow, no personality. Then I had to hear her complain that the manager wouldn't give her Christmas off and how some other guy got it off claiming he was visiting family but his family is here etc................Dude! Take it to the kitchen!  The food was good......I had the Fillet, mom - T-Bone. The steaks were cooked perfectly.....the bread was good with the pumpkin butter, not a big fan of the green beans and beans. After the nose blowing and attitude, I can't see any super compelling reason to return, even the sparkly city views. :(

Ok never going back to this place again. Easter day nothing open, heard about this place figured it would ok. The host that walked us to the table and left without a word. Maybe an "enjoy" would have been nice. He then tells a server "I sat you" Server looks at our two top and grunts. Nice. I'm already so happy to be here. It just gets worse. The food tasted awful. Our server sneezed into his hands twice and kept working. We asked for side plates and he asked another server if there was another and she said this is the only one here and I don't know if it's clean. Talked to the manager after and he said sorry thanks for letting me know, but he never even asked where I was sitting. Never again.

I finally went back to the Persian Room after moving back here from Australia. My family used to make me jealous talking about the Persian Room when I was on the other side of the world. I had my usual this time around. I loveeeee Ghormeh Sabzi with Tah Dig. Yummmy. I order the Beef Barg as my entree. It a super tender fillet. It was almost as good as I remembered. My only complaint is that we sat upstairs when no one else was there so the service or lack thereof was not good. I love Persian food so I must try Pars next!

Ha ha. The reviews here are hilarious. So my ex bf and I always go to La Perla. We have drinks and dance the night away here. We are usually the only non Mexicans in the group. When we first started dating, I thought what the hell am I doing here. It grew on me and I love it. The bartenders don't even speak English! We have a fun, unpretentious night here. People are nice and you see another side of life, instead of the typical Scottsdale places I usually frequent. It makes me remember who I am and that I can have a blast anywhere.

We were trying to make our way to Harold's tonight for the fireworks party and ended up caught in the downpour. We didn't want to turn around and head back to The Phx so we stopped at The Horny Toad as it was the only place I could find a parking spot. Walked in soaking wet and waited about 30 min. Just my luck,,,,,woo hoo, I get the sour faced server from hell! A server can just ruin ruin ruin your meal. Uhh.....She didn't so much as crack a smile the whole time we were there. When taking our order, she asked what my mother wanted and I replied that she was debating between three things. My mother started telling her what she was debating between. Instead of listening and offering suggestions, she cut her off and said, well are you ready? Seriously? She never asked of she wanted something to drink. She dropped off our food and didn't ask if we wanted anything else. We had to flag down the manager and others to get us things we needed. Awful awful.   Ohh yes, the food. It was ok. We both ordered the prime rib. It was a little over cooked for med rare. We had to flag down someone else because she forgot the horseradish sauce. I've had much better. The food was not great and not bad, just ok. It might have tasted better with a server who gave a damn about her customers.

This is another of my local little jaunts. I usually will pop by for a glass of wine and the guacammus dip and monster quesadilla. They are both yummy for my wine filled tummy.  I'm big big on my outdoor patio's and this one a swinging couch. I feel like I'm at home but getting waited on! Gotta love it.....

I loved the food here. It was the best sushi that I have tried in Arizona so far. The service was so so but I can't wait to go back and see if it was a one off experience. My caterpillar roll was one of the best I've had and sashimi tasted fresh and not at all "fishy"

I stumbled across this place by accident with a co worker of mine. I noticed it had a fifties vibe but was names flaming kabob. I had to try it. I am a sucker for Arabic food. I was married to an Arab so I know great Arabic food. I actually love to find little holes in the wall like this and be pleasantly surprised. The service is nothing to write home about, but it wasn't bad. The prices were good. I ordered a shawarma sandwich and thought it was wonderful. I don't think I have had it that good in Phoenix yet. Maybe a fluke? Don't know, only been once so far.   Some of the reviews below crack me up. Someone said the hummus needed spice? Um sorry, but hummus does not have spice it!! It's chickpeas, tahini, fresh garlic, salt, olive oil and lemon. I loved what I ate and if I am ever in the area again would definitely eat here.

I found Phoenician Health Group a while back when I was looking to lose some weight  (they offer massage, chiro, wellness, etc.....). I made an appointment and everyone there was very accomodating and super nice. The front office staff and Dr. M were great. He takes time to sit and help with issues and advise you on what is necessary to help achieve your goals, unlike some practices where it feels like a cattle call.  I would def see Dr. M again!

Not a big fan. Somehow have been here 3 times for lunch and each time it is just mediocre. I keep ordering the sushi lunch special and it's just never that great. This last time, it was very slow at lunch and it took forever to get our food. I probably should just give up on this place. I don't know how I managed to eat here again as I told my co worker on the way there that I didn't like it.  Hunger addles my brain.

I am a big fan of the random Phoenix wine bars around my North Central area. A friend was playing here Thursday night so I decided to finally visit. I'm very happy i found a new place with outdoor seating to relax and have a killer glass of Malbec (I finally found a place with several Malbec choices!!) . The firepits and lighting are fab relaxing and perfect for some romantic start gazing etc. My date ordered the veggie panini sandwich and loved it. I just ordered the cheese platter with nuts and dried fruits and the 3 cheeses I chose were very good. Love cheese and wine! The only slight drawback was the service was a little slow. Will def add this to my phoenix wine bar rotation.

Being Greek I'm picky about these places especially when they are not owned by Greeks. This place impressed me. I now am there about once a week for lunch. Everything tastes fresh, the lettuce is crisp and the meats are yummy. This is the best little gyro joint I have found in Phoenix.

I went back today. I always wind up here on Saturdays strolling around old town in the afternoon amazed at what a ghost town it feels like. So many closing down signs or available signs in windows. Kinda sad. I always wonder how the few shops left open do survive. So I love the pizza here. I feel like it's one of the best I've tried locally. I can't give it the five stars because the lady behind the counter is so dour. She doesn't crack a smile and seems almost put off if I hesitate one minute when ordering. Customer service is huge for me. It's almost like she sours my appetite with her attitude whenever I go there. I would probably frequent the place much more if there were actually friendly welcoming people behind the counter. If the pizza were not so good I would never go back.

Way too crowded for it's small size. Have to wait 20 minutes for a drink while you are being suffocated by so many bodies. The only escape is the small outdoor area where you are again crammed in. The place looks nice but I'm not about waiting that long for drinks while sweaty bodies press up against me.

I had a great time here.  I think all the cougar talk is ridiculous. I think if the 40+ crowd like to get out and have fun more power to them. I loved sitting outside and people watching here. The drinks were great, no stingy pours here. The staff was nice, nothing like the uptight uppity Barcelona bouncer group. Good music, good times. I will be back.

I take Salsa, Bachata and Tango classes here ever Sunday night. I love this place. All classes are $5 dollars and we have a blast. They have a schedule on their website. They offer so many classes that everyone can find something they like here. Terry is the owner and he teaches some classes. Our instructor Miguel teaches the Salsa and Bachata.  Get your dancing shoes on. It's addicting.

I had driven past Dino's Appliance several times recently and finally decided to pop in and ask a question about a problem I was having with my dryer. I walked in and met Dino the owner. We started talking and he is super friendly. I told him about the problem that I had had for two years. (My dryer door would not close and I had to prop it with a baseball bat). I always assumed that it would need a door replacement and just never bothered. When I told him what it was, he came out with a small 3 dollar part and told me that is all I would need to pop into the door. He showed me how to do it! I had no idea it was something this simple. Had I called another place, they could have possibly charged me an arm and a leg to come out. Dino knew what was wrong right away. He offered me a bottle of water and some great conversation. I would recommend him to anyone and already have. He offers valley wide same day and next day service. If you want personal friendly and honest appliance service from a family owned and operated local business, call Dino.

Ok, the only reason I was at Toby Keith's was for a coworkers bday. Never again. It was some sort of torture that I would just as soon forget.  The only thing I had to eat was a steak Quesadilla which arrived 20 minutes late because they brought me the wrong food originally. The place only played Toby Keith music until the band started. Fine, I didn't know who he was but anything playing for two hours in a row would get on your last nerve. The worst part of the whole night was the men. I was kicked in the calves by a guy trying to get my attention. Really? Do you really want to talk to me &*^hole? Yeah try kicking me again. Another dubious guy asked me to dance and I told him that my feet hurt (6 inch heels in a crappy bar does have that effect).  He proceeds to say, "That's what you get for being so *&^%ing sexy"  Wow. So by all means, if these lines and gimmicks are your cup of tea, you might like this place. I on the other hand will stick to my wine bars.

Ok so after driving past this place a zillion times, my girlfriend and I went for lunch here before a much needed mani/pedi. The place has a modern look that includes a lot of the original "hair parlor" pieces. I guess the host stand is even made from old wood recycyled from the o.g. buliding. Anyway......we ordered the Parlor Insalata and it was great. It has crispy chickpeas and the smaller size was more than enough for the two of us to eat and have extra. We also ordered a pizza with a mix of toppings and it was great. They would not do a half and half and my friend had to pick some things off so that was the only not so fab part of the food. Service was good. I am def going back in the near future.

Found the doctor via his website and called for an appointment. The ladies that answer the phone are sweet so I felt I made a good choice. I was taken into the room and a sweet girl asked me questions and told me the doctor would be right in. He came in quickly and asked if I would mind if someone that was following him would be present. Fine. The other guy walked in along with a lady (medical assistant maybe). No one introduced either of them. Dr. Racette didn't ask me one question and didn't address any of my concerns. He seemed to even brush off the questions I asked or responded with brusqueness. It was very irritating as a patient to be asking questions about serious topics like skin cancer and feel blown off. He prescribed a cream for me and was walking out the door minutes after seeing me and said he would have someone come in with the script. He never talked to me about how the cream works or what it does. Awful awful. Too top it off, they were supposed to call me with test results. I had to call them and the gal that answered said, "no one called you with the results yet?: NO!! Will not see this doctor again. Sorry but I actually prefer doctors that care to take the time and actually address my questions and make me feel comfortable, not take 5 minutes to rush me through an appointment.
