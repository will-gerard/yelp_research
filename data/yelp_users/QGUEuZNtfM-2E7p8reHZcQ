I have only been seen here three times and Dr Caleb Lauber is the best Dr I have ever seen he pays attention to detail and goes over everything there is no time restriction he answers all your questions and is genuinely concerned about you as a person as well as a patient. the only down fall is his assistant she is rough around the edges not an inviting spirit, she doesn't make you feel comfortable and she is not friendly, other than that a perfect setting everything a patient could ask for.

they tried to tell me I needed 4 new tires when I hadn't had the tires on my truck for a year yet tread was fine, said they couldnt let me leave with my tires in the state they where in, it was unsafe, I just went in for a balance and rotation, I ended up going to another discount tire and they said my tires where fine, I have been buy the same tires for my truck for teh past ten years and never had an issue, I wonder how many other people they tricked into buying tires that didn't need them.

sat at the pharmacy for 5 minutes no one acknowledged my presence at all, when I went to leave they asked me if I needed help, I ignored that, and went and shopped when I came back the same thing happened they ignored me again, a young lady came up to the front register not to help me but to work on something else, I hate to say it was my the color of my skin but I see no other reason why they would ignore me totally not even a hello we will be right with you! I have taken my business else where and will not be returning to this Target and its a shame, there is a pharmacist that is there that goes above and beyond unfortunately she wasn't working yesterday 8/10/15 when I went.

avoid this verizon store they lie to make sales like car salesman and if you dont catch it your stuck in a contract or paying for stuff they said was free, dont trust them read everything before you sign, I have been lied to twice and ripped off twice from this site its all about the money they want to make a sale at any cost so customer beware.
