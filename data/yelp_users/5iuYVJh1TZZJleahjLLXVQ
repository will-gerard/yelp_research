we try to come here whenever we are in the area as hubby use to work by here and use to come once a month or so. the fish is awesome and so is the french fries!! i did need to reorder a piece of fish as some meat in it but they took good care of us!! there were 3 of us and the bill was $30-little pricy but we cant find a fish fry that tastes as good as this. atmosphere is older but the food is good!! try it you just might like it!! :) sandy :)

We have been to Arriba's several times now and yesterday for brunch was really good.  The food is fantastic, waiter friendly.   What made the experience so awesome was even though they forgot the appetizer that my son had ordered but apologized and came out with it pretty fast! We had two different waiters and the second was really up on things. They constantly asked " do you need anything"? Love the fundido sauce and walking out the door they all said "thanks for coming, have a good day".

My office is close to this restaurant now and I was craving for GREAT itialian food.  I have not been there for years but I remembered how yummy their food was. The young waitress was very friendly, courteous and I asked her should I get the pizza or one of the other lunch special specials? She did mention receiving a salad with the meal and suggested the pizza is the BEST! The WORST thing the waitress could do was not come back to me with a salad that I thought I was going to receive. One of her customers came in and she had a longgggg conversation and totally forgot me as a customer and still waiting for my salad. Waiting for about 15 minutes.... I stood up and told 2 other employees who were having a break at a table.  They attended to me with the salad and one of them explained that I really wasn't suppose to have had the salad with the pizza.  I explained that the young lady and I were talking about 2 different type of lunches and I thougt she said salad was complimenting both.  I then told the other employee IF the young lady came back to check back on me-IF I needed anything, she could have told me then I wasn't suppose to have received a salad, BUT there was "no" checking back on me at all!  I also was waiting for a refill on my drink and told them again I was waiting and I was going to the bathroom.  At this time I was totally disgusted. :(  Then when I walked out of the bathroom, the young lady was talking about how I wasnt suppose to have received the salad.  I interrupted her and said IF she would have only checked back with me, I would have been ok with her level of service. I haven't been back since and not sure IF I ever will. The OTHER employee did comp me as she said she WANTED me to come back and she was sorry. This is a mom and shop restaurant and I am shocked that with ALL the restaurants going out of business that this level of service exists. This wasnt a real recent visit but thought it should be mentioned.

We have been going there weekly for a business network meeting in the wee hours of the mornning. I have also ordered a vege omlette and it's pretty amazing! Their sausage is good too as it's not a little link like other places. Our waitress does a good job to our 22 businesses there.

we went to el encanto at the cave creek location for mothers day this year and last :) this year i pigged out (lst year surgery) food was very good and ranged from omlettes made for you as you ordered them, mahi-mahi, made to order waffles-yum!!   cheese enchilada's (just as good as their carefree location) fresh squeezed orange & apple juice/cider. service was really good as waitress mentioned that the orange juice that i ordered to her previously, you can get where the food was and i said i saw that-she didn't hesitate to ask me if she could still get me a glass and i replied yes please :) i was impressed with that as my food was hot and i didn't want to go back up to the line and wait. that's service for you!! the atmosphere also at this certain location has a huge pond with ducks, turtles and birds and is a delight to be there in the morning and have a nice buffett brunch with watching the scenery along with it. there's nice local shops across the street to visit in addition afterwards. support our local restaurants and shops!! sandy :)

Went to Applebee's at Happy Valley/I-17 on Friday night to use our "25th Anniversary"  gift card with hubby and son.  We all ordered the Blue Cheese Bacon Hamburger.  It was loaded!   The blue cheese was probably the best weve ever had!   The only dissappointment we had was the low portion of french fries I received in my order and had to ask for some more.  When more arrived it was about 15 more in a rather large basket??   What's up with the french fries Applebee's??  IS there a shortage of potatoes?  Other then that it was a good dinner and we were so fullllll.

This is a good place to eat the pulled pork & cabbage, or the b-que-beef and chicken mix and just tried the chicken misubi and its pretty amazing. You also get a side of macaroni salad-no one make it like they do-mild but awesome!  You get two servings of rice also with your food.  ALOT OF FOOD!!! My daughter introduced us to this place originally and it's yum! Different kinda menu but you have to try it as it's like nothing else! Did you know they open at 10 in the morning for those who work early?? YUP!!

The roast beef sandwich has LOTS of roastbeef on it-yeah!  The salad is the bomb!  Lot's to chose from on the salad bar.  Frozen yougurt-YUM! **The GIFT certificates** need to improve though as my friend had taken me there and her gift card of $30 was NO longer valid as "when you don't use it"  you are charged $2.00 monthly against your balance?  Really? Cashier DID really care IF we were going to be returning customers and worked with us about this gift card not being a "true gift card".

Weve been going here since it opened.  Friday nights are ussually busy with happy hour and all you eat fish friday.  Fish is pretty amazing and noone can top the South Ramp Burger-HUGE!! IF you want a monster hamburger-makes a big mac sad :( you want to order this!  IT has awesome blue cheese and is pretty amazing and see IF you can finsih it??  Also, their mash potatoes w/brown gravy is too die for!! I do have to say though the backup guys-will most likely bring your food out instead of your waitress but their friendly and will bring you whatever condiments you need. Yes there is a bar but there are also tables for families to sit at.   A good mom and pop restaurant :)

We had a Business Mixer at this location and was dissappointed.  IT was prearranged that we were coming as a group and to stay on a certain type of menu as everyone buys their own food and drinks and it's happy hour at this time.     The happy hour menu wasn't presented to everyone and they were shocked at the drink prices.   The prices of EACH person who "ate" was charged separate prices!  But there was ONE POT of the melted cheese shared with 5 people????  Each salad was $4, was very tasty BUT small.  The dessert (One Pot of melted chocolate) was awesome BUT each person who ate it was charged $5 a piece. Guess what the bill was for two kids and two adults??   $88, and they charged over a $10 TIP for two kids. Gratuity was NOT discussed prior to this meeting. IF you are going for a "Special" occasion for two adults, I can see spending this kind of $$$ maybe?  Other then this, we weren't FULL but the restaurant sure was full with our $$$.

We had a Business Mixer there last night and first time experience was a GREAT one.    Amazing experience as we were in the entertainment/lounge area and the owner and staff took REALLY good care of us!  Nice to see a Jazz Band there too and comedy :) My husband and I towards end of mixer had a Huge, Very Tasty Steak Chimichanga!   Had a Hurricane Drink too and it was awesome! We are coming back in May for another Mixer! Sandy           West Valley Mixer          westvalleymixer.com P.S.-Also had lunch there last week, tacos and the service was amazing!  :) Nice when your having lunch and having to work on computer at same time. Their carrot cake was so BIG that I had taken a picture of it-YUM!! Was a less stressful experience. :)

This is a newer location for the restaurant and was impressed!  The atmosphere is more semi to formal then other locations and very cozy and comfortable.  Went in there this past Saturday evening to host a Tupperware social and it was very pleasant and NOT noisy as other locations.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  We even stayed late and they were very patient with us.  Roast beef Asiago very tasty and the french onion soup was awesome with the melted cheese inside.  Their chocolate chip cookies are Wonderful! Thanks again Arrowhead Paradise Bakery, plan to see you again soon! :)
