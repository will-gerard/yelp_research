Unable to accommodate a party of 18. Said they ran out of food even though we had been working with them for several days to plan this. Told us the day before our event. Way to leave us high and dry.

Tai reached out and invited me back. They gave me a wonderful experience. The food was very good full of flavor and the service was top notch.
