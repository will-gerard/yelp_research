Try the Chicken Parmesan!  It's the best I've ever had? Quite possibly. When I worked in that area we would hit it for lunch once a week. Donna is awesome in a take-no-shit-but-still-take-care-of-you kind of way. She calls it as she sees it and I think that's great. By your third visit she will most likely know what you are gunna order. I can't comment on the rest of the menu as I've only ordered the Chicken Parm. Yeah, it's that good.

Great food, great service, fantastic atmosphere. This place is busy for lunch and busier for dinner. You can't go wrong ordering just about anything. A personal favorite for lunch is the French Dip. The salmon was outstanding. Try the side of Mac and Cheese. It's the best I've ever had; white cheese, and creamy but not very thick.

Dinner was fine for the most part. We asked to have a chicken breast put back onto the grill because we wanted it well done. And then we got to watch the Line Cook make faces at the server when asked to put it back on the grill for a minute. He didn't realize we were right in front of him. Unfortunate for both of us.

This place is Old School Class. The staff is Top Notch and they have been there a long time. That should tell you a lot about how the place is run. 5 Star Fine Dining without a Celebrity Chef and absolutely zero pretension. This is not a "Place to see or be seen at." It's just an outstanding restaurant. You shouldn't feel anything other than comfortable. Everyone greets you. Servers not serving your table will check in on you and bring you things when requested instead of just waiting to tell your server. They don't play the, "Avoid Eye Contact" game that most servers play at other resorts. So the service is Top Notch. The food is outstanding. Close your eyes and put your finger anywhere on the menu. I haven't had anything I didn't love. The buffet for Breakfast, sandwiches, salads, etc. for Lunch; and it's a Steakhouse so you know what's up for dinner. Can't recommend it highly enough. My brother had his Wedding Reception here.

Remedy Pilates and Massage offers outstanding services and is operated by a friendly and knowledgeable staff. Located West of Scottsdale Rd on Shea, it's easy to find. Pilates sessions are offered for one-on-one training or in a small group. The instructors focus on your goals and they will push you as hard as you want or help you still get good work out of a lower impact session. Massage, acupuncture and chiropractic services are offered also. I've been doing Pilates for a couple of years now (all @ Remedy) and it has become the foundation for my personal fitness. The focus on engaging your core muscles throughout the movements of the exercise makes for a much more efficient workout and you feel the results fairly quickly: Going up stairs, bending, kneeling, sitting and standing all feel easier, like my entire body is lighter. I feel lighter on my feet and my sense of balance seems to be greater. My energy level started increasing also. If you are banging away at the Gym 3 to 4 times a week, coming home exhausted, getting sore and still not seeing the results, time to try something else. And to any guys that are not quite convinced because it looks nothing like the traditional workout... That's kind of the point. Challenge yourself and find out if you can hang.

Only one star for their customer service.  Employees deal with customers because they have to, not because they want to. The enthusiasm is long gone. Multiple times I have walked all the way through  this store passing employees along the way that are talking with each other and not saying a single word to customers walking past. Last week I counted; and I walked past eight employees not with any customers, none of them made eye contact, none of them said hello. All of them looked like they didn't want to be there. Today an employee bent over to adjust the angle of the lid of a MacBook Pro as I strolled past. He moved it a quarter of an inch. Three other employees let me walk past without a word. People hate going to the Apple Store now. They hate dealing with the Genius Bar even more. You're reading this right now shaking your head in agreement.

Very talented group of performers. My favorite is the "twins" when they perform hanging acrobatics either from a hula hoop type ring or fishnet hanging from the ceiling. Mezmorizing to watch. Sexy hawtnes.

Great lunch spot for me. Close to my office, friendly workers, the soda tap is set to tasty and they sell Otis Spunkmeyer Chocolate Chip cookies... I'm there about twice a week!

Tonight was my first visit and I really enjoyed the pizza. The pies were served round and cut into squares. The crust was thin and baked to a perfect crisp. That stood out to me the most but the ingredients were great also. The pepperoni had that sharp taste that it should. I love basil and was not disappointed. The onions were crisp, the ham had the same robust taste as the pepperoni and the pineapple pieces deserve their own separate review. I'll be back for sure.
