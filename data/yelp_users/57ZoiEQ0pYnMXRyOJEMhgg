What a beautiful Dive Cafe !!! I ate there for the second time today and it is excactly what Arizona needs. There is no crappy corporate presence and it is not an over decorated establishment .  It is a simple cafe with hooser pennents everywhere. Biscuits and gravy are available as a side to my omelete. (No boring toast which I can have at home) This is a middle america restaurant that makes me feel as if  I am in a novel. I am waiting for a Patrick Swayze Replica to show up and challenge me to arm wrestle for not being local !!!!

Common! No one wants your crappy Breakfast!   I love Pranksters Too. It is the perfect local dive sports bar. At night you have your faithful barfly's challenging you to a game of poker or pool. There is loyal Suns and Cards fans yelling obscenity's. When Steve Nash throws the ball into the stands during the fourth quarter of a playoff game because he can't run anymore because the Suns never gave him a backup (Thank you Rajon Rondo trade), the Pranksters people start breaking things.  One night about four years ago there were about forty Sorority girls there. It is a night we will talk about for ages like it happened yesterday.  Celeste is a great hostess type bartender to the establishment and always makes me feel welcome. There is a guy bartender (whose name I can never remember) who also makes Pranksters a home.      I stopped by this morning taking my Mom out for the Michigan football game. I am starving and want some good football food. The bartender hands me some crappy breakfast menu. COMMON! No one wants your crappy breakfast ! The eight people at the table in  front of me refused the breakfast  also.  It is not only Pranksters pulling this joke on the consumer. (Pun intended)  Other bars try this crap on us while attempting to watch an early morning football games.  Give me a hamburger, a Ruben or some Nachos .    I will return. In fact, I left my Mom there while I do a load of laundry and post this review.       It is now 11 and I can order some real food.

What's worse than having boy wait on you at Ra? Having a boy wait on you at Ra that doesn't know a thing about Sports when the NFL draft is on and the NHL playoffs.  He service was stellar, and that is usually a stretch for RA Tempe.

Here is a tip for the bartender. When a person walks into your establishment, stands three feet away from your bar, and this person has not been in your establishment before, say hello. This customer is looking for some guidance and support from the staff with a bar that is 75 percent full.  I know the girls sitting at the bar are cuter than me, but I tip better.  My eventual waitress, Rachel saved the day. Good food. Good Sports Bar atmosphere.

WHAT PASSES FOR A BOUNCER THESE DAYS ? These guys were skinny and nice. If I were to start a fight with a guy much larger then me, who would save me? If I were picking on somebody smaller then me, who would save them?  The situation felt as if some ASU fraternity guy was in charge of hiring and found all of the rail thin sophomores under 21 to get them into a bar on a Friday night.  (Probably Sig Eps, I have known a few across the nation, little weasels)  My fraternity brothers and I back in Philly (Yo Sammy, Gamma Psi, Temple U) would be starting fights in this place just to prove that we could.   The bathroom attendant was nice and gave me a towel after I used the urinal. He also selected a nice cologne he had bought for 60 dollars that day!  (He only allowed me one squirt though)   Overall, I liked the Cadillac Ranch. I was there once for a football game and the Nachos were good. I will return during the peak season and possibly for a football game. There are many large screen T.V.'s .  I would write about the D.J. and his knowledge of late 90's hip-hop but I have already lost interest in this post.

I was very pleased with my evening at Blue Martini. My visit was for a friend's birthday on ladies night. (Yes, she is a lady) The ambiance and decor were excellent. The stage behind the bar is great, I did not feel the usual Scottsdale-Arizona cheese from Blue Martini. It almost felt as if I were in another city for a moment.  (Then some silicone walked by) The bouncers were welcoming and professional. I did not see one Affliction shirt, the label I detest and see upon Scottsdale commoners. Yes, I know Blue is in The Phx . Our Pocahantes looking waitress was friendly and  attentive. I will return, though I hear City North is struggling.

I have never been understanding of people. If you are being served by a waitress for over an hour, do you really try to pay at the bar? Have you ever ate in a restaurant before? This is not a Denny's. Even worse, the waitress was in close proximity. Fun Country bar though.

Have you ever been to a nudy bar and you couldn't get a lap-dance because the coke dealer was at the bar and all the girls were flocking to him and his weasel friend? It happened to a friend of mine once and he described the scenario. This is the feeling I had on Sunday night when my friend and I were seeking a simple hamburger at Twin Peaks. Every girl seemed to be gathering around the same table where two gentlemen were seated. It was unusual because I usually receive excellent service. (from the lunch crew)    I peered further at the table where the five girls had gathered intently. There were two big boy mugs of beer on the table and nothing special. I was expecting a Caesar salad to arrive at the table and Italian style service to occur with one girl grating the parmesan, one girl rubbing the pepper mill, one girl bringing the food, and one girl smiling. Twin Peaks doesn't have a Caesar salad. The food runner girl arrived at their table with what I expected to be my imaginary Caesar, but she had no food and she joined the collaboration of the minds at the table.  I considered opening a couple of sugar packets and emptying them on the table to see if we could get some attention. I wound up not having to go there and a waitress arrived to take our order. The food did eventually arrive and was excellent as usual.    Twin Peaks succeeds where Hooters and Tilted Kilt fail serving quality food. I actually like the Cobb salad and the honey mustard is excellent. Try the mac-n-cheese as a side. And of course, football season is coming!    I will forgive and return for I usually visit for lunch and they seemed to be geared towards that shift. Also disturbing was that my friend and I were the two best looking guys in the restaurant. It seems like we would get a little bit of attention.

Worst Zipps experience of my life. (I was at the Camelback location for the early games) I felt about as welcome as I do everywhere else on this empty Mill Avenue.  I am returning to AZ for 5 days after moving away a few years ago. I walked through the front door. Two waitresses chatted away without acknowledging me. I walked 15 feet into the bar area. I had a dumbfounded look on my face as there was no seating. I looked at the NFL football above me. A man in with the Zipps logo on his Golf shirt walked by me without a peep. I walked the other side of the bar. Miss  Leany-Poo was working. She continued her lean. She looked very comfortable. I wanted to be as comfortable as her eating some Zipps wings watching NFL football. After receiving no assistance,I sat myself at a larger table. I sat for 5 minutes with a parched throat. Tell the waitress wearing number 11 that I tip better than the students that sat there after me. The polo shirt guy came by and he wound up being the clown manager. He came over and said I couldn't sit there. I hate being asked to move. I am glad hospitality is alive and well on Mill. I am glad hospitality is alive and well in Arizona. Good bye Zipps on Mill.
