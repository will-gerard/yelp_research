This spot was always a regular drop for me when I was spent time studying for the GRE at the library. From what I've heard, this place has been around for quite a while which is a testament to the food they serve. It's important to know that this place isn't authentic Japanese, it's American Japanese, so prepare your taste buds accordingly. So far, this is the only place that I've found in Phoenix that serves Japanese curry. This isn't like hot sauce over a dish, this is the real deal.  As far as the food goes, it definitely hits the spot and is always sure to please. My usual tends to be the chicken curry. They really know how to pack in the flavor and make a portion that's not too big and not too small. My only complaint is that they tend to go a bit over on the onions. Another thing to pick up while you're there is their Japanese soda. I forget the name of it, but it comes in a glass bottle and it has a glass ball that rolls around inside. It's refreshing and fun to drink as well. The sushi here is kinda "eh", but it fills you up and chances are that if you're eating there you're not looking for top quality sushi.  My impression of the place is that it's family owned by the women that work there. The older one is really friendly and makes sure that you're enjoying your meal after she serves it to you. You can tell that they really appreciate your patronage and want you to come back. It's always a good thing to know that the owners of a restaurant are passionate and take pride in what they do and treat it as more than just a job.  It's been a while since I've been here, but I really need to swing by again. Some people would probably just brush this place off as some small food hut on a street corner. That would be a huge mistake. This place is like the Yoda of Phoenician restaurants in that it reminds you that, "Size matters not."

Jeez, I didn't know this place was still alive until I moved back.  I think it's safe to say that this shopping center was a failed experiment in bringing people back to downtown. Sure, alot of people are slowly trickling back to the center of the city, but not as a result of this. The lifeblood of this place tends to be the suit types that swing in for happy hour at Hooters or other bars that think that interior design is bolting an rusty Route 66 sign to the wall.  If this place didn't have a movie theater, I'd brand this place with one star.

Even though I came here with my dad and as weird as it sounds, this seems like a really good spot to take a date. I kinda came into this place by a half-way accident and found out how it really was. I'm French, so after seeing the dopey sounding French name that doesn't mean anything, I decided to check it out. The minute I stepped in I thought, "Oh crap, should've shown up here with a girl." Seriously though, it's not that bad. You can show up here with anyone, but it seems like a more date-ish kinda spot.  The range of wines at Cheuvront is pretty good. There tends to be more American or South American labels, but there are a few European ones as well. What makes this place unique to the Valley is that it's a wine AND cheese bar. Being French, these are two things that you are raised on and make such a wonderful marriage of tastes that it seems like such a travesty that no bar has been devoted to both. Anyway, the wine here is good and so is the cheese.  Overall, this is a really chill place to either wind down after work or to shmooze with a date. I highly recommend this place because if you haven't done the wine/cheese thing you really don't know what you're missing. Just a heads up, the best nights to go here seem to be during the weekend; other nights are just dead.

If know about the Welcome Diner, chances are you've heard about it by word of mouth or just stumbled across it by chance. Regardless, this place is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Everything in the place feel like you stepped into David Lynch's mind while having happy thoughts. The place is super small (8 seats) but that just adds to the authenticity of eating in what might one day be a museum piece of 1950's culture.  The food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap. If it's the right day, be sure to see if they're making veggie burgers and ask for a float too. The staff is also really chill and make sure that you're satisfied. They offer everything: good food, good atmosphere, and a good experience.  I just wish they had later hours....

If only I had the money to buy some of the stuff at Red Modern Furniture... Regardless, this store has some of the nicest pieces of furniture I've seen. What's more is that it's all vintage, so you know you're getting the real thing and not some retro copy. You can really tell that they take their time and use a critical eye with what pieces they choose to restore and sell. I have no problem with sounding pretentious here, but the furniture they have in stock truly are pieces of design art. If you can afford what they have to offer, buy it. If not, feel free to peruse around the store as though it were a museum. I used to live in LA and there were places like this in Silverlake, Melrose, etc., but none of them had the selection or quality that this store did.  The owner here is really cool and encourages you to look around even if they know that you probably can't afford anything there (like they did with me). Another thing about the owner at Red Modern Furniture is that she's really passionate about what she does and I thought that it was really cool that I could talk to her about what was in the store.

This place is a genuine surprise. I walk in, totally expecting an old restaurant with 5 & Diner decor, but I was completely wrong. Essentially, all the furniture, counter, and fixings of the place have been there since 1928. Hell, even our waiter looked like Fatty Arbuckle. If a place manages to stay alive and well for over 80 years in this city that loves to chew up and spit out its historical locales, you've got to give that joint props (Sing High being the exception to that rule).  The cuisine at MacAlpine's is what you'd expect: old fashioned and American. It's nothing spectacular. What really makes the trip however is their soda selection. They've got something like over fifty flavors. I tried out the Blueberry Cheesecake flavored one and my friend was treated to "The Wrestler": a weird/delicious combination of some cherry flavoring and some thing else that tasted like Dr. Pepper.   In conclusion, this place is a landmark worthy of it's reputation garnered. Its service, vibe, and overall offerings are a testament as to why it's still standing after eight decades.

What happened to you?  This place, specifically this Macayo's, used to be so good when I was a kid. I came back here last weekend and I was so disappointed. Everything about this place just seemed way sloppier than how it used to be.  Essentially, Macayo's is one of the staple eateries of Phoenix. It's like a bastard cousin of Garcia's (RIP). It's the typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing too spicy but plenty of taste and it's heavy too. It's true though what the reviews have described it as: a Mexican TGI Friday's or Denny's.  It's so sad to see Macayo's in the state. It's like that girl you used to think was cute when you were in junior high... but then you bumped into her a few days ago at the grocery store and she looks worn out in every sense of the word after surviving through four kids and three divorces. C'mon, Macayo's! Take care of yourself!

To be honest, I came here with low expectations. I really just wanted to try it just to say that I had. For some reason, I associated this place with Lux, of which I'm not a huge fan but I think it's a great place to hang out at.  Anyway, I dropped in and some girls sporting the Tina Fey chic took my order of the soppressata. After a few minutes, I got my meal and went outside to eat it on the patio. Then the scales fell from my eyes. Could it of have possibly been? Was I really eating the best sandwich I've had states side? Hands down, this was the best tasting sandwich I've had outside of France. The bread itself was pretty good, but the mozzarella and basil were amazing. As I was putting all the pieces back together in my mind as I was chewing, my mind's soundtrack began to play a Minnie Ripperton track. It was official. I was going to marry a sandwich when I grow up even if it meant I had to convert to please its family.  Seriously though, every sandwich place that I go to now will have to live up to this place. The interior is cool, but it's more of a place just to pick up your food and eat it to-go or outside. The taste alone is what makes this place. My only wish now is that my sandwich bride would have better hours.

Phoenix just got a lot more livable.  My standards for movies rental places have always been Vidiots in Santa Monica or Old Bank DVD in downtown LA, but this place has etched a new spot on that list. Since moving back to Phoenix, I tend to get movies from the Burton Barr branch of the Phoenix Public Library downtown. I know it's a public library, but it actually has an awesome and extensive collection of foreign films and just about a every title from the Criterion Collection you can feast your cineaste eyeballs on.   Anyway, I was browsing the foreign section and was pretty impressed. It wasn't the usual, pitiful selection most rental places usually have that pretty much is made up of The Seventh Seal, Seven Samurai, maybe a French title, and an overload of pre-Loaded Weapon 4 Jet Li martial arts films. No, sir. While it's not as big as the stock at the downtown library, it's still pretty good and they have alot of recent films.  What sold me was when I was wandering around the store. I came across something that I normally haven't found in any video store: Russ Meyer films. If you have never seen "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!", I suggest you scrap any plans you have tonight, break up with your significant other if necessary, go here, and rent it immediately. Buying a copy of a Russ Meyer films is ludicrous process that is both arduous and expensive, but you can just go in here and rent them.  Along with that, you can find just about any cult film you're looking for and probably find titles you've never heard of or seen, like I did. There's literally a whole wall that's just labeled "CULT FILMS". I dropped in here last night for the first time and rented a copy of Russ Meyer's "Vixen" and a title that I had seen in Amoeba but never watched called "A Boy and His Dog". It's a film about Don Johnson (yes, of Miami Vice) surviving in a post-apocalyptic world with his telepathic dog and fighting off a cult of underground humans led by Jason Robards in clown, drag make-up. Need I say more?  If you're looking for a hard-to-find title, or even a popular one, drop in here and keep this place alive. When you have an itch for a film right away that can't wait for Netflix, as I do on regular occasions, this spot will be sure to please.  If you have any taste in film, I repeat.... GO HERE TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!

For real vinyl collectors, this is the place to go. They've got an excellent collection of most of the classic genre's (funk, soul, rock, etc.) but if you're looking for rarer stuff, I suggest hitting up Grandiose. Most of the records here are decently priced and the quality tends to be great too. The thing I love about this place is that it's a real, dirt-under-the-nail records store. Stepping in, you can tell that this place has a history as long as most of the LP's they sell. This place is a shrine to good taste in music and a sanctuary for those who know what's good.  As far as issues I have with the place, I think they have way too much John Denver era type recordings and not enough funk/soul/R&B. It's a question of personal taste and that's all. Besides that, this place is a total hole in the wall which is why I love it and why I think it continues to remain one of downtown Phoenix's best kept secrets.

After scouring high and low for the perfect bike, I finally found it here. Aside from the good price they gave me, the service was really great. A guy named Adam helped me out and he was really friendly and knowledgeable about all the question I had to throw at him.  Overall, they have a pretty wide selection of bikes which is nice to see because every bike store in Phoenix seems to only sell beach cruiser types or mountain bikes. As far as accessories go, you can find pretty much anything you're looking for here from locks to a horn for your handle bar. Another great reason to buy from here is that if you get a bike, you get one free tune-up whenever you want to come back in.  Come here for the perfect bike, perfect service, and perfect selection of what they have to offer.

To be honest, this place sucks so much as compared to how it used to be. Like all vintage clothing stores, you have to dig through piles of crap to find that one diamond in the rough. Buffalo Exchange is no longer like that store. Now, you just dig through garbage and getting nothing out of it but a grimy feel and a fetid stench of indigence on your hands. I also found out, after selling some clothing here that Their selection here just sucks.  The only thing that's generally alright is their shoe selection. I got a pretty sweet pair of Nikes for $30.

If you're a Tarantino fan or have seen Pulp Fiction an embarrassing number of times then you know what Jack Rabbit Slim's is. If Jack Rabbit Slim's existed, this would basically be the Phoenix franchise of it. No, it's not a wax museum with a pulse, it's just a great place to go to after a long night of drinking/smoking/etc. with friends. The music is great and the food is good no matter what your level of intoxication is. Now I'm not using that as a jab at all, that's part of the reason I love this place. Where else could you stuff down a greasy burger at 3 AM, gulp down a massive shake, listen to the wailing of Buddy Holly, have a waiter named McFly, and enjoy being trashed all at the same time? Sure it's not the cleanest nor does it have the best service, but who cares?  If you go at the right hour late at night you'll see people that you are convinced could not be out in sunlight. Be sure to look for the guy that looks like a hermit Santa outside with the wildlife scenes he hand painted on his van. Again, I'm not knocking this place because it's part of the experience. If it's not for you, wear your paper hat and go pick up your order at In-N-Out's drive thru.

One thing about Phoenix is that it's near impossible to find French food, and good French food at that. Well, look no further than Au Petit Four. I'm French, so I've got to admit that I've got a bias for eating at a French place that serves real French food by French people. The owner is really cool and makes sure that everything is tip-top while you're eating. To be honest, everything is pretty pricey but it's totally worth it and I don't think that there's such a thing as cheap French food anyway.  Be sure to check out the quiche lorraine and to try one of the eclairs. The only thing that is painfully missing from this place is having a stock of Orangina in the fridge, but c'est la vie, non?

I was so pumped to check this place out after I found it by complete accident. I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix (they must be doing something right, yeah?) as well as being the only thing standing from the city's historic Chinatown. But, seriously, this place did not live up to anything to any of my expectations.  Now I know some might argue that this place serves American Chinese cuisine, and that's true. However, this is some of the nastiest Chinese food I've ever had. Some might complain about the decor, but I actually kinda liked it. I felt like I was in a Jarmusch movie so I'll give the place some points for that. As much as I'm into dives, this is a little bit higher than a place I ate called Won Kok which I am convinced is the butthole of Los Angeles' Chinatown. To be honest, all I that had at Sing High was the chow mein and the wonton soup. The wonton soup was just old cabbage boiled in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oily noodles. Needless to say, I felt like I was giving birth to the Antichrist a few hours later.  Go to Sing High for the experience of saying you were there, but keep your mouth closed at all costs.

Why beat around the bush? This place sucks. You can tell that someone just bought the building and thought, "Yeah, old florist shop turned overpriced restaurant... OH, THIS IS AWESOME!!!" Just because you've got an antique sign with flashing lights does not mean quality and in this case it certainly does not mean atmosphere. Everything is overpriced and ridiculously underwhelming. What were they thinking?  What they were thinking:  - "I'm gonna open up this really cool restaurant that used to be a flower shop. Now what are we going to do about food?" - "Well, my son knows how to make stuff...' - "Really?" - "Yeah, he's four." - "What can he make?" - "Well, he's really good at rolling these snakes out of Play-doh. I don't know if...." - "Stop drilling, you've hit oil! We're buying tables, a mega piano, and we are making this happen!"  Just stay away from this place unless you plan on being adventurous and moving your wine circle/Oprah book club meeting outside of Scottsdale for a change.

Five Good Things and Five Bad Things About The Phoenix Art Museum: Or Ten Things You Can Say About The Phoenix Art Museum and Sound Pretentious.  Good Things  1: Yayoi Kusama' piece "You Who Are Getting Obliterated In The Dancing Swarm Of Fireflies". If you were lucky enough to be in any city were the Ecstasy exhibit toured a few years back, this will definitely bring back memories of that experience. This was the one piece that I felt really made the visit to this place. It's probably the most engaging piece they have at this museum. It's like Cornelia Parker's "Anti-Mass" on acid (a piece which is also housed in this museum and worth checking out).  2: The samurai armor and weapons section. Overall, I thought the Asian Art exhibit at the museum was kinda "meh". It's the usual pottery and calligraphy fare, but this was something I was not expecting and was pleasantly surprised.  3: The Khalo, Riveras, O'Keefes, Picasso, Keith Harring, and Candida Hofer. These are really the finest pieces of non-classical art that are housed here. Be sure to check them out.  4: The museum has a couple of lookout spots with great views of the city hidden away at various corners.  5: The architecture and design of the building alone are works of art. Everything from the fountain outside to the spaces created inside that really allow you to engage in the art form.   Bad Things  1: For me, the art here is kinda hit or miss. I feel like a few of the pieces are really good and engaging, where some of others are just average to dull.  2: Waaaaaaaay too much Western Art. I know it's a part of our state's history, but really? I could go to some gallery in Old Town that pedals this stuff to tourists and old money in Scottsdale whose idea of fine art is a place mat set from the Louvre.  3: The last couple of traveling exhibits that came through here are so-so. Generally, all art museums are like this. Not everything they decide to show is going to please everyone, and I can accept that.  4: There really aren't a whole lot of sculptures or installations here. I don't think the museum should limit itself to a majority of paintings and photography. Something different would probably break up some of the monotony you start to feel after 30 mins.  5: The museum's store kinda sucks. I like a museum store to have tons of books, dvd's, or other hard-to-find art-related items that I can really only get at a museum store. I felt like this place was decently stocked with their books but everything else is just kinda kitschy shirts and an overload of Frida Khalo memorabilia.

Essentially, this place is "Party Foul light" during the week. Sure it's dingy and sure it's cramped, but that's just the spot. Love it or leave it.  I was here the other night for my second time and I dug it. What to say about this place... cheap beer in cheap pitchers, a solid pool table, DJ's with choice taste, and a machine bolted to the restroom wall that dispenses pornographic stickers from the 80's. The interior looks like some sort of post-apocalyptic, bombed out Tiki hut. Sounds like a good time, and it is. The crowd here is pretty diverse, although it's mostly hipsters though (remember: Party Foul light). If you're lucky, you'll see some characters that look like they're out of a Bukowski or Hunter S. Thompson story and that definitely adds to the spice of the place.   I saw a woman there that had to be at least in her late sixties that looked like she dug her way out of a halfway house with a spoon. Once the DJ played a Curtis Mayfield song she started dancing and didn't stop throughout the whole time I was there. Using that image as a metaphor best describes this place: an old soul that's still young at heart.

I'm not gonna lie, but this is seriously one of Phoenix's best kept secrets. I'm Native American so I grew up on frybread and I was floored when I found out a whole restaurant was devoted to celebrating it. Also, it's Tohono O'odham owned and operated so that gets huge points in my book. I really don't think I could stand the idea of a "fry bread house" being run by anyone but Natives. The beef stew and hominy are choice, and all come with fry bread. This place may very well be a future heart attack coming on, but I'll die with a smile on my face.

It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very "meh". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.  The interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.  The service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?  There's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was.

First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.  Second: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.  Third: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.  Fourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.  Fifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.  Sixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.  Seventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters.

This place gets two stars not because it sucks, but just because it's very "meh". I heard alot of hype about this place from friends and my Hispanic friends as well that kept calling this place the "Mexicans' Mexican restaurant". Well, if that's the case, then clearly Mexican cuisine leaves much to be desired.  I ordered a flauta dish that was large in portion size and skim on flavor. Like most Mexican food however, I felt like I was busting at the seams after I was walking out of the restaurant. One good thing I will say about this place though is that their chips and salsa are pretty good. In the end, I really don't know what was worse: my deflated expectations or my burning intestines the next morning.

We can't stop here... This is cougar country!  Seriously, this is such a cougar's den. Not just that, but this place has the biggest infestation of douche bags. You need a gas mask just to cut through the Axe, bronzer, and fumes of hair gel that linger throughout the air. If you want a visual of what this place looks like on the weekend, take a gander at: www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com . Click it. It's a real site and it's what this place and its patrons looks like. If you model your style of dress and behavior after VH1 reality shows, drop in for a swig and some high-fives from your fellow date rapists. If not, just pray in thanks that Scottsdale is where it's at and everything you love is where it is.  There's a live band that plays and I'm not a fan, mainly because it's not my type of music. They play alot of butt rock and the like... basically stuff you'd expect a cruise ship band to have jam sessions to in about 20 years.  The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star as opposed to none (if that were an option) is that the staff is pretty good. They tend to see that everything is going good and do a good job of bringing what you've ordered on time. Lastly, I feel bad for alot of the waitresses. How they put up with a crowd that takes pointers from episodes of Rock of Love and Tool Academy, I will never know.

Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, "What are you doing here?" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.  If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.  A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.  If you go here you're one of three types of people:  1) You were dragged here by your friends 2) You're under 21 or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, "I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!"

As of this morning, this is my new means of a regular workout. Overall, it's a great way to burn calories, get your heart rate up while getting a great view all at once.  After being warned by my mother that the northern trail was "basically rock-climbing", I was releaved when I found out that it was nothing that extreme. It's a pretty solid track all the way up until you hit the last stretch. It's called Camelback mountain because it looks like a camel, and the first part you see on the northern trail is what you think is the camel's hump. Wrong. That's just the head. The HUGE, hidden crag that the head covers up from your inital view is the camel's hump. Once you reach that point, you will curse yourself, your mother, and the day you were born for going through with all this and how the mountain tricked you into thinking it would be a cake walk.   That last stretch before you reach the peak is brutal, so make sure you've got a bunch of water bottles or a camelbak on you as well as something to satiate your stomach. When you've made it to the top, you're treated to what is likely the best view in the city. It's natures way of patting you on the back before she lets you sprain your ankle on steep way back down. Once you've made it back you can add Ben Stiller's quote from Heavyweights as your line for the day: "Stragglers get left behind... I know I did." You deserve it, so use that line with pride.

This tends to be my main vein for my movie fix. They have an awesome collection of foreign and classic films that has yet to be matched anywhere in Phoenix. If you're looking for a foreign title that's in the Criterion Collection, chances are that you'll find it here. The great thing about this place too is that you get to rent up to five movies without having to return them for something like five weeks and you could probably spend your whole life doing this once a month and never get through all the films they have.  Another reason I love this library is the architecture. It makes great use of the space and doesn't feel like an academic library. One random thing however is the odd Borg Cube-like sculpture that looks like it crashed in the main entrance. Overall, it's just an awesome building to be in and experience. Burton Barr is a really peaceful place if you need somewhere to study. There's an awesome view from the top story where you can get a great view of Central and downtown.  My only complaint? It smells like homeless people in some spots. That sounded cruel, but you know what I mean.

This has the best pastries I've had thus far in Phoenix. Sorry, Sprinkles.  I had a butternut brownie and a gooey ooey that i split with a friend. To be honest, these were some of the best pastries I've had. Like ever. Not only were the good tasting, but the frosting was perfect. Not too soft, but meant to be eaten with the pastry rather than just a garnish. My mouth was watering when I saw the cakes they had inside. I'm waiting for just the right occasion to come back in and buy one.  As far as sweets go, this is the place to stop by. I haven't tried their bread yet, but I hear it's good.

This tends to be one of my regular haunts. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have Chimay in stock which automatically gives them a few extra points in my book. Another great reason to drop by Shady's is that there's always a decent amount of people there any night of the week. In other words, you're not going to show up and look like the jackass who likes to down a tall one with the 60 plus date-rapist who doesn't know when to quit.   The thing that sets Shady's apart from other dive-esque lounges is the jukebox. It's nice to shoot a few games of pool while listening to a jukebox stocked by someone who has choice taste in music and doesn't crowd the machine with the standard Art Laboe "Best of" mix.   So, go to Shady's, relax, get tipsy, shoot some pool, and chill out to Joy Division, Bowie, New Order, or whoever is playing on that beautiful machine.

The house beer here... My friend and I dropped in here for our first times and ordered it. The sweet aroma of that brew was hard to pinpoint. I said some sort of berry, he said orange, and our waitress claimed cannabis. From that point on I was sold.  Overall, I like this place. The look and ambience of the Roosevelt with their beer selection and presentation makes for a wholly enjoyable experience. It's definitely worth all the trouble trying to find the place. Depending on how you look at it, the size of this place is either a pro or a con. It's a good thing in that it builds a relaxed and quiet atmosphere, but it might be a negative in the case where the space gets filled easily. The bar is literally a house that they converted which I find cool, but I will admit that some of the rooms give off a claustrophobic feel.  The Roosevelt definitely is and will be a staple of the burgeoning arts district, so try to go by there before it becomes too well known. Make sure to check out the crazy good berry-citric-weed beer too and keep the secret to yourself.

It's not that I don't like this place, it's just that it's very run of the mill. Bison Witches does the standard sports bar cum college drinking hole thing. That's all that can really be said about this place. You can't really hate this place for that because it is what it is. A milquetoast spot at its most average..

I've always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater. On the one hand, there aren't a whole lot of options to see independent film in AZ besides this place and Camelview, so I've got thank Dan Harkins for those outlets. On the other hand, there are times when this theater plays the SAME movie for weeks. An examples of this was with What The Bleep Do We Know?. I hate it when this place does that, but it's nice to see films here that wouldn't normally get play at Camelview (ie. Che: Parts 1 & 2, Let The Right One In, etc.).  In all, this place is a bit like my own Cinema Paradiso because I have so many fond memories in this theater. There was a Pulp Fiction screening when I was in high school and I got to go to an advanced screening of Slumdog Millionaire and actually got to meet Danny Boyle when he showed up for a Q&A afterward. I just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like The New Beverly in LA.

The arts district is starting to grow on me. At first, I really thought this area was Phoenix forcing itself to create a legitimate art scene, and in truth, that is what it's doing. My argument is that you can't create a culture that's not there. But with that, some authenticity does arise. The Lost Leaf is one such place.  The beer list a this place is both extensive and choice. I've never been to a bar where I could find a Gonzo Imperial Porter. If a bar has anything that's Ralph Steadman in it., even on a bottle (such as this), I'm all for it. I ended up getting a Vanilla porter of some kinda, I forget the name though but it was pretty good and only $4.   The look of this place is kinda hard to describe. It's like if Pee-Wee Herman joined the Road Warrior in some post-apocalyptic bike gang and then came back and re-opened his playhouse as a bar. I say that with no malice either. I love the decor here and to be honest, I really don't know how else to describe a bar that has a relief of the Creature From the Black Lagoon hanging on the wall next to a bust of something that looks like one of the melting Nazis from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  In all, I really wasn't disappointed by this place at all. Good beer, good art, and a good space.

The food and beverages here are as good as the cause that this place stands for. I was really surprised to see how this place actually was because I was expecting some sort of folk jam band/Vagina Monologues reading spot where hackey sack tournaments were held. Even though I consider myself liberally-minded, I take joy in ravaging a rare steak in front of a dirty hippie. I hate hippies. However, the people that run this place are hippies and I use that term in the best possible way. They're not all talk, they're actually practicing what they preach by running a cafe like this and I respect them for it and fully support it. It's like they're the American Apparel of Phoenix coffee shops that was American Apparel before they started using sweat shops.  This place gets A's all across the board for service, food, drinks, and for the relaxing environment that you get to experience it all in.

So, I was walking by the place the other night and a friend told me that he had gone here a few times. He said it was a family-run place by some Russians who had been cutting hair for five generations. He also said that the father's old Soviet uniform was on display and that they gave you free beer while you waited. We had been drinking a bit before that I thought he was just making this all up. Thank God he wasn't.  The next day I stopped in for a hair cut and it was honestly one of the best that I've had. It was just like how my friend described it, Soviet uniform, free beer and all. Boris, one of the owner's sons,  was the only one there but he was really cool and friendly. He's a fifth generation barber with a 120 year family history of cutting hair and you can really tell that he knows what he's doing; and he does it very well too. I'd never been to a real barbershop before but this place was the real deal. The Downtown Barber Shop really lived up to my expections and then some. You can tell that the family who runs this place is passionate about what they do and that they really appreciate your service and in my book that makes this place a step above most others.   Generally, I don't give out five stars that much, but this barbershop really deserves it.  I'd give it six for the Monica Bellucci picture on the wall alone.

One of the few places where I can justify splurging a hefty chunk of my paycheck. Besides what they usually have on display, their sales rack is also really impressive. I picked up two shirts, a pair of jeans, a vest, and a sweater all for around $70. Another element that really makes this store is their accessory offerings. Lomo cameras, USB turntables, Mighty Muggs, Chuck Klosterman books, etc.. As far as shopping goes, you'll definitely find this spot to be a breath of fresh air when it comes to Scottsdale Mall or Oldtown. It seems like this place has figured out a way to capitalize on hipster culture and managed to not make it as cheesy as expected.

My jaw dropped when I stumbled onto this place. I could not believe that a store like this existed outside of a city on either coast. This store is truly a slice of geek heaven in the form of toys, clothing, and even a boss selection of hard-to-find magazines. Knowing a place like this is around really makes me happy and I just pray that it stays open and survives this horrible economy.When it comes to vinyl culture they offer everything and more you could find at a Kid Robot or Giant Robot store.

I honestly can't tell if this business started up as a passion project or someone's idea of the funniest way to rip off the rich and convince them that they were being trendy.  I'm always fighting an internal battle when it comes to Sprinkles. While they're ultimately VERY tasty and definitely the best cupcakes I've ever had, I still find myself thinking, "I'm paying that much for six cupcakes? Really?" I've been eating they're cupcakes since a few years back when I lived in LA and these were the new "in" thing in Beverly Hills. It's no surprise that their first move out of CA was to Scottsdale and besides In-N-Out, it's one of the best imported franchises they have to offer.  To be honest, as far as flavors go, you can't really go wrong with anything you pick here. They're super rich, so really think about if you want just two or a dozen. It makes sense as to why they give you a fork a knife to eat these things.  When it really boils down to it, Sprinkles is a guilty pleasure. By picking up an order here and enjoying it, you feel like you should be at a party with the kind of people that dress their chihuahuas in juicy couture hoodies and drink only beverages that some how include hand picked wheat grass from Bali. On the other hand, the cupcakes are so good that you decide to suck it up and savor the taste.

When I go here, I generally tend to show up on week nights. It's got a good feel that's both relaxed and intimate. You can hold a conversation over surprisingly well-priced wine. It's obvious that this place is the owner's passion project (I've heard it's the same owner of Delux). He/She probably thought , "Panini's plus wine equals cool," and they were right.   What really works about this place is that the food is as good as the wine you can order. Added to that is the pricing of everything. You can stop by for a good late night bite and eat/drink stuff that you'd normally have to open a vein to pay for.

While on my way to the Fry Bread House I heard the echoes of a Ramones song that I hadn't heard in years. That was when I first saw her she beckoned me in. I couldn't turn away, those beautiful albums on vinyl hanging from her walls. Stacks of CD's that burned me up inside. The mere sight of them I could not refuse. Everything from At The Drive-in to ZZ-Top. This was too good to be true. And that DVD collection of hers... Was this for real? Was I allowed to see what was before me and feel my way through what she had to offer? She let me flip through her movies and I was lured in further. That's when it happened. Sid and Nancy. The out-of-print Criterion Collection version. I felt my heart race and my breath quicken. Only $7? This had moved from beyond mere lust. I was in love.  That is true romance, young men. Something that was effortless and cost next to nothing. I began to question my faithfulness to Stinkweeds and Zia. What if they found out? That would be the end of it. That's when she began to purr out New Order. That's when I knew everything was going to be alright and going back to that place would be our little secret and that it would always be as good as the first time.

The thing that makes Conspire so unique and awesome is that it's many things rolled into one. It's an art gallery, a clothing store, a library, and, of course, a coffee shop. Some of the other pluses about this place are that they're independent and stay open pretty late; which makes for a great stop if wandering around downtown. It's not hard to tell that this spot is a passion project of the owner and it definitely shines through in all the right ways. Another reason this is a nice place to chill at is that there are always people hanging out here and chatting, mainly the workers and friends. They create a very inviting atmosphere and make you want to come back for more.

There are alot of negative labels people throw on England and English culture, some true and some unfounded. Some of these are: poor weather, poor food, and poor women. If this place were actually British, you could throw on poor service as well.  Great location, poor service. They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service. I had to go up to the waitress to give my order and go to the cashier to pay my tab. It's not like the place was busy either. The only time she came to our table was to serve us our drinks. What's worse is that she just had an attitude the whole time too. It's a shame this place sucks because the area it's in is cool, as is the antique house it operates out of. Do yourself a favor and go hit up some other bar like Hanny's or even the bar across from this place.

Before coming here, I'd never really had Jamaican food. The Breadfruit was a really good intro to Carribean cuisine and it definitely makes you crave for more. I've tried most of the dishes here and I must say that this place boasts a pretty solid selection of dishes and tastes. It's a great place to bring friends to eat and the atmosphere makes for a relaxing environment as Jimmy Cliff, Steel Pulse, or The Wailers sound from the kitchen. Be sure to try out the curry tofu, sorrell, and carrot juice.

The reason I'm giving this place one star as opposed to two is a simple, yet annoying element of this place: the portraits of dead musicians on the wall. WTF do Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, or Sid Vicious have anything to do with Japanese food?  These portraits on the wall are just one of many examples of how this place does not get anything. This place is treated as a club by the bouncers outside, but it's really just a sub-par restaurant in the disguise of a high-end Japanese restaurant. So, Geisha A Go Go are you a club? Bar? Japanese place? All of them?  I was here for a friend's birthday a little while back and I found that the food overall is not worth what you pay for. Of course they go with a "minimalist" gimmick and give you insultingly small portions. The service is alright, but again, nothing special.  I don't think even hara-kiri would bring any honor to this place's horrible sushi. I guess the usual Scottsdale, Diesel jean-wearing date rapist wouldn't know the difference between good sushi and mediocre with all the blow dripping down his throat, so I guess this usually goes unnoticed.  Now, if you talk to a fan of Geisha A Go Go you might hear them mention, "But, they've got really cool bathrooms." Well, I don't go to a restaurant to dump out the meal I just ate. Japanese Fusion Restaurant fail.

While rethinking a trip I took to Myanmar a few years back, I really don't remember eating anything typically Burmese. Just chicken, rice and fish really. After eating here, it made me want to go back and see what I missed.  I came by here last night on a whim with some family members not really knowing what to expect. Starting off, we ordered samosas which were good, but not great. For our main courses we had Beef Marsala and the Chicken Basil with jasmine rice. The portions weren't huge, but it was just enough to split three ways and not feel overly full. Those two dishes were made up one of the best tasting meals I've had in a long time. Describing the food and the flavor is hard to do because it's not as hot as Thai, not as spicy as Indian, but definitely not Chinese. It's kind of this weird "it's like this, but not like that" mix which makes sense given Myanmar's geographical location. Regardless, it's some of the better tasting food I've had in Scottsdale and is surprisingly well-priced.   If you've ever had an ABC drink, they have a desert that's alot like that. I forget the name, but it was the perfect way to end the whole meal. The mango-raspberry sorbet was also ridiculously good as well.

When I first heard the word of mouth about this place I rolled my eyes. My expectations were that it was going to be a "Little Scottsdale" spot downtown or that I'd walk in and find a bunch Reagan look-a-likes in suits drinking tall ones and discussing synergy. Well, needless to say, I found neither of those two nightmares awaiting me.  I've been to Maizie's a couple of times now and I've yet to be disappointed. All of their food is surprisingly well-priced considering the portions you get, taste, and presentation. I had an order of the hummus as wells as the Southwest Chicken Salad. The hummus was standard but the Southwest Salad was one of the best I've had. Another time I ordered the Chicken Asiago Alfredo which wasn't too heavy but definitely hit the spot. Their selections of beers is also pretty solid. I've yet to go there for happy hour though.  With that being said, I've also got to give Maizie's props for creating a laid back atmosphere. It's nice being in a place that if it has a busy dinner hour you don't have to raise your voice to hold a conversation. It's the perfect spot to go for a late dinner. In all, Maizie's is an enjoyable experience that definitely calls for multiple visits.

In all honesty, I've only been here once and it was only for drinks so I've yet to try the food. One thing I will say though is that their gimlets and gin and tonics rank amongst the best I've had. Sure, it's a hotel bar, but it looks great and the place sets a chill mood. The bartender I had was really friendly and would stop by to make to conversation and to see that everything was good. From the reviews, this seems kinda hit or miss, but  I guess I got lucky.

Hands down the best tea I've had was from here. There's so much flavor packed into each serving that you'll probably slap yourself for ever drinking something filtered out of a tea bag. The first time I came here I bought the cheapest one I could find and it was really good. Since then, I've come back for whatever they recommend. If you know your tea, this is the place to go.

Definitely alot better than what I was expecting. This is one of the few places that I've eaten at, Phoenix or elsewhere, where the decor and set-up reflect the cuisine. For instance, you can see the food being prepared outside of the kitchen and it's all fresh (at least I think it is). It's fresh, it's honest, and it's got nothing to hide. They specialize in foods that are organic as well as several vegetarian friendly dishes (not too sure about vegan though). True Food Kitchen is about as healthy and tasty as food can get in the Valley. There are alot of negative stereotypes with health/vegetarian cuisine. In the back of the layman's mind, he thinks he's going to get horse food. I think that sometimes and I eat vegetarian on a regular basis. Well, be prepared for True Food to destroy those labels.  I ordered the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza and my friend got the chicken one. Both were delicious and tasted, oddly enough, very clean. I don't really know how else to describe it. Fresh equals a clean taste. Anyway, the food is to be experienced and it's well worth it. The portions aren't huge, but that's the point.  One thing I will so however is that you can tell that the people that are die-hards about this place are also from the area (PV/Biltmore). I kinda have a hard time telling if they actually enjoy the food or if they see it as being a very LA type of spot in Phoenix, thus sorta giving themselves points simply because it's trendy. What I'm trying to get to is that I really enjoyed my experience here I really do believe that there is something for everyone (vegetarian/carnivore) here. Just don't expect it to be Madonna's "Like A Virgin" in a culinary incarnation that the yuppies tell you. Go there with no expectations and you will have an awesome exprience.

For me, Hanny's was quite the odd find in Phoenix. It's the type of lounge you'd expect to find in LA, Manhattan, or some other metropolitan city. Being that I just moved back to Phoenix from LA, I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to find something that would help my transition from the City of Angels.  To be completely honest, you go to Hanny's for the atmosphere and the drinks. The food isn't great but the salads and appetizers are decent. I've yet to try out much of the drink menu but the gin and tonic as well as the gimlets that they make are pretty solid. That being said, the bartenders are really cool guys and make sure you're taken care of. The DJ's that spin on the weekends are also pretty good; however, they play alot of ambient or lounge type music so don't go there and expect to cut a rug like at Homme.  Overall, this place is pretty spot on to take a date or just to chill out. Hanny's is truly a rare find in Phoenix and I hope to stop by more often.

I was expecting SideBar to be all hype after the reviews that I had seen and even from my judgment of this book's cover as I have driven past it many times. A nice, chill bar in the same building as a Pei Wei and Starbucks? Well, I'm currently chewing a fat slice of humble pie. This is hands down one of the best lounges that I've been to in Phoenix.  The second I walked up those narrow stairs I was surprised to find this shoe box of a lounge. Don't let the space discourage you at all though, you'd be a fool to let that happen. The interior and decor are very stylish while at the same time they set a vibe that sets you at ease and allows you to enjoy your drink. I came here on a weeknight so I don't really have a clue as to how it is on the weekends or how crowded it then. Based off my experience however, I found this to be a great spot to bring friends for conversation and drinks.   I ordered a Manhattan, and while it was a bit heavily mixed, everything else about this place really made it a great experience. SideBar doesn't really offer any to eat besides some smaller finger type foods like hummus. A complaint I had about the hummus was that it came with pita chips rather than regular pitas, but that's a small complaint given that I had an overall enjoyable experience.  SideBar, you've found a new patron and a new spot on my favorites list.

Although I've only dropped in here a few times, I've really fallen in love with this place. I just moved from LA back to Phoenix and I really wasn't expecting a whole lot returning home. I did not think a store like this could be found outside of the Bay Area, LA, or New York. They've got an awesome selection of clothing, hats, and vinyl records. The best thing about this place is the owners/staff. They're totally cool with you just hanging out and chatting and they even encourage you to dig around in the vinyl collection. They've got all the best things a hip-hop/street culture store has to offer and then some. If you're about real music and real style, this is the place to go in the Valley. Accept no substitutes.

Like most Scottsdale clubs this place looks really good inside and like most  Scottsdale clubs it lacks any soul. The place definitely gets points for creating something that looks like it's out of Wong Kar-Wai's 2046, but I am seriously disturbed by that rank bathtub they have there. How badly do you have starve and drug up some poor girl after locking her in a basement to make her slosh around in a tub filled with cream? I don't like skanks in my milk, just cereal. It's really too bad because I think the look of this place is great, it's just the people that go there (ie. date rapists snorting blow and giving each other high-fives). If the crowd was different, I'd totally be here but I'm too lazy to start dusting off those diesel jeans and tight shirts with slightly angled prints of family crests. I also can't seem to remember where i left my wallet chain.

As far as what Phoenix has to offer, this is definitely the best comic book store to go to. This location in particular is the best one in the valley.  I've been frequenting here since I was in the fifth grade and I've yet to be disappointed. What's great about this place is that they have all the current issues available as well as a strong collection of back issues. They're also pretty good about maintaining a solid manga section as well.  Another reason worth stopping by is their "indie" selection ala Jhonen Vasquez, Charles Burns, Clowes, etc..  If you can't find it here, they'll order it for you so you won't lose any more sleep about what Superman said to Wonder Woman in that one issue of Red Son or whether you can find that favorite issue of Toyfare that you lost in junior high.  If you're looking for a crash course in geekdom, you'll find everything and more here. The staff is pretty knowledgeable and friendly if you're looking for something in particular or even if you're just wondering what's good to read. This place is definitely a staple of Phoenix and isn't leaving anytime soon.
