Want the Wild West Saloon experience? You got it here! Feel the small town charm of Cave Creek-cowboy food and outdoor chill.

Quiet atmosphere, good food, attentive staff. Will go again. We had pot stickers, Shrimp Lo Mein, and Sweet/Sour Pork. Loved that fried rice is standard in the lunch specials.

Been here many times & now get a dirty, cheap corner bar feel. Dirty bathrooms tell me a lot & now they have someone providing "valet" service.

Loud place, not somewhere to come for a relaxing lunch. Great healthy food, very fresh. Small Greek salad $6, husband liked the Gyro.

ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER! Been there with a private party and smaller groups. It wasn't a fluke-the manager either short staffs or the waitresses we got were inattentive to such a degree we had to order from the bar before service came. NEVER AGAIN!

They we're so personable and professional.  My boy needed neutering and the price was unbeatable.

Came for the free appetizer. The brisket quesadilla lacked enough cheese and the brisket is bland. Liked the Mac and Cheese and he liked the links.
