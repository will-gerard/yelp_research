This was my first time here. I like the concept of Cornish pasty. I tried the lamb vindaloo. They do a fine job on the crust. My two cents- cook the potatoes a tad more, cook the lamb a tad less and instead of using the canned tikka masala as sauce, make your own. It's not that hard but it's going make a lot of difference!

I don't have a whole lot of expectations from airport restaurants but serving raw fish would still catch me off guard. The fish was not properly thawed and was tasteless on top of being raw.
