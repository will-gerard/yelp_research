After striking out at the San Tan location I decided to give the Chandler location a try. I spoke with Maria about my concerns with the other location and she made sure that I would not leave her store feeling that way. She set me up for a facial for today. When I walked in both of the girls greeted me and got me all set for my mini facial. The facial was so nice and relaxing even if it was only for 20minutes... It was 20minutes of Heaven! I was able told everything that was being used on my face and explained in detail what each was for. I even got a neck and shoulder massage with some lavender oil!! After my facial was over the girls offered to touch up my makeup lightly since I still had other shopping to do! Even though your not supposed to apply makeup heavily after a facial I said yes and allowed her to work her magic. All in all it was an amazing experience and I will for sure be coming back to this location even if it's out of my way it is well worth it!!!

I honestly can't say enough about the AMAZING service I get every time I come and visit Chapman Chevy!!! Linda and Douglas are beyond amazing when it came to getting my car looked at it last minute!! And I simply can't forget the God of Mechanics Carlos!!! He was willing to not only fix the original issue I brought my car in for but he fixed all of the active recalls on my car knowing that he wasn't going to get off on time! He stayed 45 minutes after he was scheduled to get off to make sure everything was taken care of and I would have to make another trip out here!!! Beyond amazing service from all those mentioned above!!! I will send everyone I know to come see them!! Nothing but good things to say about all of them!!!!!!!

After a few hit and miss attempts on our last couple of visits we are back yet again! Simply because of one man.... Michael! One of the best managers I have ever met! He has made sure that past mistakes are corrected! We walked in tonight and found the perfect server for us and has even come to check on us frequently! He is very attentive as to his customers and is more than willing to correct any mistakes the moment they are brought to his attention. He knows how to make customers feel welcome and valued. His ability to adapt and interact well with his customers is what keeps me coming back!!!

I love Grimaldi's! The staff and service goes above and beyond of what is expected! They are always busy but they don't let that slow them down!!! My pizza is always hot and fresh when it arrives at the table! If there is ever any issue they make sure that it is handled properly and in such a way that it seems as if nothing ever happened!! I have only had one incident and it was something that was out of their control! When you come ask for Sherri! She works Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 5pm-close! Seriously the best server they have here and super sweet!!!!!!

My husband and I went in today to get pedicures. It was a last minute thing and figured we would go here since we were already there. While there we received horrible service. The ladies were talking about my husband, they upgraded our pedicures to a more expensive one without telling us, and they did not do what I had asked them to do with my nails. I asked to have a gold flower design on my big toe. The lady didn't do so then threw a fit when I questioned her about it and still didn't do the design. She didn't even get all the dead skin off of my feet so I have to go get another pedicure because she did such a rush job on my feet. My husbands feet look as if nothing was even done to them. When we paid the lady told us the total. When I questioned it about being more she told us we had been upgraded to different pedicure that cost more. I asked her what was different between the two and there was nothing different other than the lotion that was used. Then because I was pissed off that we were charged more than quoted for a less than superior job I did not leave tips. Everyone in there began yelling "NO TIP!!" over and over as if trying to embarrass me into leaving a tip. Their tactics did not work and only embarrassed themselves as we walked out a group of ladies were walking in and asked us what the yelling was about. I told them and they said that they would rather take their business else where and walked off. The ladies inside began screaming even louder than before when they saw the groups of ladies walking away. Needless to say I will NEVER return here and I will tell others to stay away as well! It's pretty ridiculous when they start demanding a tip and treating their customers like crap! If I knew that we could call and complain I would..unfortunately I know nothing will be done since the manager/owner was in the salon when this all went down!! Next time I will check out the reviews before going to get a pedicure last minute!!!

I'm simply in love with everyone at EVFP! I have an amazing doctor; Dr. Timothy Baker, his staff is amazing as well! I've been a patient for several years however this is the first time that I've had to see anyone in the office several times a year due to medical issues. Every time I make an appointment it is effortless and can usually get in within the next couple of days, there are not any unusually long wait times, everyone is friendly and willing to help you, if you need to get ahold of your doctor, a PA, or an MA you can usually do so same day! If you have to leave a message they return your call in a very timely manner! All in all I would recommend everyone I know to go to EVFP because they are just that great! They have been taking care of my family for 15+ years and will continue to do so in the future!! Thank you to the amazing staff!!!!

I love the staff at this location!!!  It's always a good thing when you walk in and most of the girls know you on a first name basis and what you've previously purchased! They also know what new products you may enjoy! I love the entire staff here! They go above and be ton of what is expected of them. One girl even picked up that I was having issues feeling "pretty" that day and she took me around from table to table and stayed close by in the fitting room to make sure I would be ok. Such sweethearts here!

No rush to come back here after the horrible experience we had. They did a segment on the news about the aquarium and the reporter specifically said that if you mentioned seeing the tv segment that you would receive admission for the ENTIRE family for $10... Not the case! We found out through a very rude employee that it was $10 per person and that we "must be stupid if we thought $10 would get the whole family in!" With a chuckle followed after. She wasn't speaking at a normal level either! She practically yelled it loud enough so the entire mall heard. There was a ton of people around so to prevent further embarrassment I paid the $30+ and took my sister. The lady taking pictures wasn't much better. Our pictures came out looking like they had been taken by a 2 year old with a disposable camera that was shaking. She wasn't friendly at all and was very rude when I knelt down to get to my sisters level she yelled at me to pick her up. In fact the only place that there were people who were friendly were at the sea star area, the Octonauts photo op area, and the gentleman in the gift shop. Even spoke to the manager telling her the issues we had and she said that there was nothing she could do and that she would talk to marketing about the issue. I thought this would be a fun learning experience and for my sister to see some of her favorite characters come to life. She did have fun and learned a lot about the different types of fish but only because I had my phone out and became a google master! Two stars for her leaving there happy she got to see Captain Barnacle and Kwazzie. But like I said we will not be returning anytime in the near future. I will just continue to find fun activities for her to do from Pinterest for the summer.

Since my last review I'd thought I would do an update. I received a message from the aquarium manager. She apologized immensely and set tickets for my family and I at will call to return as we please. She attempted to make things right where her employees went wrong. That tells a lot about a manager and how she expects things to be done and handled. I'm sure we will be returning soon to see if our experience will be better the next go around.

I've been dealing with Alvin for several months trying to get my membership cancelled! I was told when signing up that if I decided on the Black Card there would be no cancellation fees and no set term amount. Both were equally important to me because we are a military family and knew we could get orders at anytime. After I found out that we were more than likely moving I called into the club and was told that my membership would be cancelled.... That was back in April. To this day I am still being charged for a membership that I don't use. I've taken it all the way to corporate only to be told that it's a breach of contract for them to get involved in customer service issues between members and the gym. Every time I call the gym Alvin is rude and very disrespectful. He talks to me like I'm an idiot and he refuses to let me cancel, even though I have filled out all required forms and sent in several certified letters with a blank check which I ended up having to void all of them because after I received notice that the letters were received by the gym and waiting several weeks each time none of the checks were processed. Even now trying to deal with the AGM is ridiculous because Alvin will not let me speak to him. I'm still being charged for this stupid membership 8 almost 9 months later!!! I still have yet to hear anything from the owners as well in regards to this issue since I have sent several emails to corporate and then they forward the emails to the owners!

So after waiting until the year mark I went in and cancelled....AGAIN! And still end up not being cancelled. I wake up this morning to find that I was charged for the last 2 months!!!! And the club manager is still refusing to issue a refund to me on the $40 that I was charged. This place is a joke and will go to any lengths to rip you off! I'm sick with a terminal illness and I've been in and out of the hospital and I was told that I need to come into the club to give them my carbon copy of the cancellation form!!! Ummm shouldn't they have one on file?!?! So over this place!!!! Pay a little extra and go to a real gym!!!

It's been over two years since I've "cancelled" my membership. They are still taking money out of my account. I've filled out forms, I've mailed in letters and still continue to be charged. I've made several attempts of contacting the club manager and he is "at lunch" or "in a meeting" with promises of him calling me back... Still nothing.

I went into this location yesterday to ask about some of their products and to see if any would work for what I needed. Upon entering I was greeted and offered a small cup of tea. I kindly told the employee "No thank you" since I'm not a big fan of tea to which she responds by rolling her eyes. I then try to ask questions about the different shampoos they off only to be ignored. At first I thought that maybe she just didn't hear me it wasn't until I was standing right in front of her that I realized that she was ignoring me. There were two employees working when I went in. One was sitting at the table helping a customer, the other was the one I was trying to get to help me since I saw the other was busy and I didn't want to take away from another customers experience. After about 10minutes of being ignored I made a comment to my husband that she was being extremely rude to which she gave one of those half hearted sarcastic laughs under her breath. I can't believe the way that I was treated in the store. I could understand if it was super busy but it wasn't. It was about 5pm and only one other customer in the store. I didn't expect to be treated like that just because I didn't want the tea. As a first time customer who knew little about the product other than I have friends who highly recommended trying them for my hair care needs, I will NEVER be going back to this location and probably won't visit another Aveda if this is how they are going to treat their customers!! You think the employees would be a little more polite. All I wanted to do was make an educated decision on what would be best for me before I spent a small fortune on just shampoo and conditioner!

This place seriously has the worst customer service ever!!! Waited in the drive thru for 30 mins after placing my order with only one car ahead of me! Then when I got to the window I had to repeat my order a grand total of 4 times to the girl working the window...who had some major attitude issues... Only to wait another 15 mins for 5 doughnuts only for them to get the order completely wrong!!! And the manager Erin had attitude when I went back through to get the correct order. As good as the doughnuts are I doubt I'll be coming back here anytime soon!!!

Just came to get my car washed here.... First I didn't get what I paid for... I paid for the $10 wash and some how got the $3 wash.... Then as I'm pulling into the tunnel I have my car in neutral and the track pushes my car forward, and the attendant at the front of the tunnel start screaming at me. Completely unnecessary when it's a natural movement of the car wash. I used to have a wash pass at this location and today just reminded me why I cancelled it. They have A sign at the beginning of the car wash asking to talk to them before you write a yelp review... Yet when I asked to speak to someone nobody ever came out.

Updating my review from two weeks ago... I went in today to redeem the free wash that was given to me as a result of my previous visit. I walked to the office door to try and open it and it was locked. I then knocked on the door and nobody answered. I waited for about five minutes while knocking in intervals and still nothing. Then got back in my car and as I was backing out two employees walked out of the office. I then got out of my car again and try to talk to them and they both just ignored me. Worst customer service ever! Poor attempt on trying to make good on horrible service. In my opinion... Save your time and money and go somewhere else.   Just came to get my car washed here....

I love this place!!! I leave here happy every time!!! Love bringing my little sister here to get lunch because they are so fast even during the busy times of day...usually lunch  and when the high school gets out. The employees are beyond friendly and willing to help me with whatever it is! One employee even helped me carry my order to my car because I didn't have enough hands! They go above and beyond the expectations of "good" customer service!!

Jill and Brittany were AHHHMAZING!!!!!! I was very nervous for my first float and they eased my tension so much that I fell asleep after watching the video!!! Then when it came time to float Jill and Brittany took us to our rooms and explained what to do and expect before, during, and after our float. Being claustrophobic I chose to leave the lid open for my own piece of mind. I floated for about 10mins before I started drifting into relaxation and eventually falling asleep. When my float came to an end soft music played and I woke up and stretched out in the water. I then got out and rinsed off and went and tried the oxygen as Jill had suggested. I did have "float brain" after my session and Jill was nice enough to allow me to hang out and relax while I slowly came back to the real world! Jill is basically my new BFF and definitely has gotten me hooked on floating!!! I would highly recommend floating at Chandler TrueREST!!!
