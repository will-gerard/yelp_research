Ehh this place is OK. The food I got was sub par and was kinda cold. felt like they gave me reheated food. Inside is not that clean and is jam packed. OK if there is no other food around

The best Fish and Chips I have ever had. I had to stop eating there so much due to my Cholesterol but it is a must have if you are out here.

This is most definitely not Roscoe's chicken and waffles but it is the closest thing to soul food out here in Az. The catfish is good but a little over salted. The service is good overall. Will go back

Great! Great! Great!    I was really impresses on how much they care for you and really don't pressure you into something you do not like or can not afford. I am extremely happy with everything and blessed to have found them. This was 10x better than chapman of mesa (used cars) here at the tempe location they are professional.

Good bar for groups. Food is bar food nothing to special. Atmosphere is nice with a nice hipster vibe. Alcohol was inexpensive and reasonable.

Awesome. The food was really good. Our waiter was fast and knew the menu from front to back. I had the special of the day. Sausage corn pancakes with sourdough bread on the side with a a mimosa and water. So far best place in phx brunch.

Nice staff but horrible dentist. they told me I had to pay 80$ out of pocket for a cavity since insurance   would not cover it. then they bill be for 200$ for a cavity. then to top it all of they didn't fill it right causing me to drive a half a hour away to get it filled at there other office 2 more times. save your time and money and go somewhere   else.

Great place to bring family and friends for morning breakfast and yo shop from local vendors and farmers. Great clean fun and safe atmosphere. All the vendors are nice and provide great food. The prices range from 5$ and up some things are overpriced but everything is local art and food. Enjoy

Service was great from the moment you walk to the time you leave. I went for the first time about a week ago and went back the next night with some other friends. The food is really priced well and then portion size is enough to have left over. But let's be honest, leftovers are for suckers. I recommend this place to everyone who likes seafood and BBQ.

Do not buy here. I do not have the best credit, but life happens. I walked in and only one person paid attention to me after I spent 15 min looking at there lot. After we run my credit and I knew I would have a huge Apr. The come back and tell me that 72 months on a used car is good deal at 325 per month. I told them that's highway robbery but say they have the best deal. They went up on the price from the advertisment and added all these things to try to sell me a car 24 thousand. The original price was 13000.   The internet manager is a complete douche. He gets mad I don't lime the deal and after I said I have other options he said no I don't and this was the best.
