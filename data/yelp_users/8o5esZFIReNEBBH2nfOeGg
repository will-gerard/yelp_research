I used to go to Xtreme Bean all the time until I sold my business about a year ago.  I always enjoyed their coffee and fraps as well as the atmosphere.  A couple of days ago I was in the old neighborhood and decided to stop by.    There was a couple in front of me.  The guy ordered a pecan roll from the case and turned to talk to his friend.  He didn't see the cloud of fruit flies that rose up inside the case when they slid the door open in back to get his roll.  I wasn't able to decide if I should tell the guy about the swarm so he didn't buy the roll, thus embarrassing the shop, or to just let it go and not say anything.  Well, I didn't say anything.  Now I have nightmares of this poor guy, his attention completely drawn by his girlfriend, taking bite after bite of this pecan roll in which there are dozens of fruit flies struggling to free themselves from their caramel tomb before he...gulp...eats them!    ARGHHHH...I wake up in a cold sweat and regret not saying anything.  So wherever you are my poor, unfortunate, soul...I apologize for not saving you from eating this high protein sticky bun and promise to never let such a thing ever happen again!

Have eaten their buffet lunch a couple of times and find the food and service to be outstanding.  The number of selections is a bit small but that allows them to keep everything fresh and hot.  The dishes tend toward fried items and thus the one star reduction.  Don't get me wrong...I love me all sorts of fried anything.  Also, their fried appetizers and main dishes are crispy and not at all greasy.  I just would like a couple more healthy selections to balance things out a little.   Service is attentive, prompt, and pleasant.  The servers always have a smile on their face and are quick to refill drinks.     G&S has become a welcome part of my weekly dining rotation.

Not sure why I haven't written Tott's up earlier.  TAD has been on my regular lunch rotation for at least six months now.    The asian food here is of very high quality, great quantity, and affordable...especially at lunch time.  My wife will even drive all the way from Carefree sometimes just to go to lunch with me at TAD (and she HATES to drive).  The owner, Young, and the girl that takes orders and brings them out, are as nice as can be.  They always have a smile and a hello to share.  Go there more than a couple of times and you are a friend.  How great an owner takes such interest in his customers!  In terms of food it is very hard to go wrong here.  My favorite is the Sweet and Pungent Chicken or Shrimp.  The coating is perfectly crispy and the sauce glazes each piece perfectly.  Think Orange Chicken with a little kick.  Other items that are great are the Chow Mein with it's slight smokiness, Tom Yum Soup with Noodles has a nicely flavored broth and they will spice it however you like.  Also comes with a separate container full of noodles for take away.  Finally,  my son loves the Yellow Panang Curry.  Great veggie selection and plenty of whatever protein you choose to put in it.  He gets angry when I eat his leftovers on this dish.  Don't feel sorry for him as he has eaten more than his fair share of my leftovers while I toil away at work!  Do yourself a favor and go to Tott's for the best asian food in the valley that falls into the category somewhere between Americanized Asian food and "real" Asian cuisine.  Now, I am going to get in my car and travel through this horrible rain so I can get me some!

I am SO HAPPY Tott's has come back so quickly!  Still the best Asian food in town.  Judging by the crowd most of Mr. Young's regulars are finding their way back.

I LOVE Oak's Diner!  Besides the excellent breakfast chow the staff is incredible.  Everyone here is always bright and cheerful...which is always a great way to start the day.    My wife loves the omelet's because they have lots of fresh veggies.  I like the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  They have a great selection of breakfast overall.  If you have the time they even make Apple Pancakes.    The bottom line is my family always feels good and is smiling when we walk out the door!

Don't get me wrong, I think that Spinatos makes the best pizza in the Valley.  But, the service at lunch today was crap at best.  Walked in for lunch at about 1:40 pm and stood around for five minutes before anyone came out from the back.  No help there so I sat myself after getting them to notice me.  It shouldn't have been too hard to be noticed since only three tables were occupied.  Two were finished and getting ready to check out and the other was just getting their food.  After finally taking my order for a small thin pizza, I sat at the table for the next 40 minutes.  I watched one pizza come out for take out and one addt'l pizza went to the table that had already been served.  I had been told my pizza would just be another two minutes.  After ten more minutes had gone by my lunch hour was over and I had to leave for work ( I was late getting back) so I just got up and left.  So thanks for contributing to what will be fun afternoon while I starve.  Although I usually go to Spinatos about once a week, I won't be back for awhile.

Re-opened under NEW management and they are back in the groove.  Have had several deliveries and always nice and hot when it gets there.  I always get extra sauce as they do tend to skimp a little, and extra crispy crust.  If you like a thin crispy crust this is it.   We actually live just outside the delivery area delineated by the previous owners.  The new owners called up to tell us they will deliver to us at the regular charge (which is always free with coupon)!  They also call sometimes after the delivery to make sure everything was alright.  Excellent customer service.  Finally, a great pizza that can be delivered to us folk in the far north boonies.

Only had to work a half day one day last week so thought I would try lunch here and see if the experience was better than dinner time was.  Unfortunately, it was even worse.    The place was pretty busy so I figured maybe I had misjudged the first time.  I ordered a gyro sandwich, falafel, and a greek salad.  Right after I ordered they loaded a new block of gyros meat onto the skewer to cook.  Unfortunately, they cut my meat off just moments after they started it so the meat was cool and had a congealed fat mouth feel.  I couldn't take more than a couple of bites.  The falafel that had been so good last time tasted like a salt lick!  Whoa boys...back off the salt shaker a bit there!  The greek salad was nothing special at all.  Finally, the ladies preparing the food look like they are simply miserable back there.  Sometimes they would call out an order when they finished it...other times the hot part of the order would sit for 10 minutes (not under any heat source) until the guy taking orders at the counter noticed it was there and called the number.   I probably won't be back as I had nausea the rest of the day (probably from the barely warm gyro meat).  There are a lot of gyro places in the valley.  It would probably be best to go to one that shows greater care in their food prep.

SR is on my way home from work just off the 101 and Shea.  I've stopped there half a dozen times in the last several months and enjoyed the most incredible ice cream ever.  Yesterday, I had the Key Lime Pie ice cream and thought I had died and entered key lime heaven.  I LOVE key lime pie and this is better!  The ice cream creates a greater depth of flavor and a wonderful mouth feel that pie can't compare to.  The graham crust inside is also nice and crunchy.  Get this flavor while you can.

We rolled into HSC around 9:30 Sunday morning.  Luckily, we snagged one of the last couple of tables before folks had to wait a bit.  Turns out the breakfast food is five stars all the way.  Even though I don't like to wait for a table, I would for the amazingly diverse and tasty breakfast.   My wife had the Roasted Veggie Omelet and I had a special called "Some Like it Hot".  After two bites of her omelet, my wife, Lucie, declared it her new all time favorite.  The peppers, asparagus, and other veggies were grilled to perfection. Inside was also just the right amount of cream cheese and seasonings.  The potatoes were a nice colorful mix cooked just right.  The Some Like it Hot is an imaginative southwestern twist on breakfast.  It has two jalapeno corn cakes, three strips of spicy jalapeno infused bacon, and two eggs.  Whoa...this was amazing.  I put my two over medium eggs on top of the corn cakes and let the yolk run down all over.  This was heaven on earth...the warm yolk was a perfect compliment to the savory corn cake.  I want these again NOW!   The service, on the other hand, was a solid three stars.  Our waitress was very much "to the point", didn't smile, and seemed annoyed we were there.  It looked as though another server was late for work and she was letting it affect her service.  One of the waiters looked as though he hadn't changed clothes in a week...and maybe hadn't slept in as long.  Check out the web site for their menu and you will be impressed.  Assuming the service was just a one time glitch, I'm looking forward to coming back and increasing to five stars.

Oh so close to 5 stars...but not quite there.    My wife and I had reservations on a Friday night as we expected OP to be very busy.  Well, the restaurant was never half full.  One of the reasons for the one star reduction was that they had several open booths but, even with reservations, seated us at a table near the kitchen in the middle of everything.  We were there 2 hours and two booths were never used.  Guess maybe they actually were waiting for Sophia Loren or Sammy Davis Jr. to show up...and I thought those tags on the table were only a joke...silly me!  Based on taste alone, easily 5 stars.  The She Crab Bisque was flavored perfectly and had a nice small crab fritter in the middle.  The corn was sweet, crunchy, and fresh.  The only problem was it was served barely warm..almost cool.  For main courses my wife had blackened swordfish and I had Lobster Tail with Truffle Butter.  The lobster was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, tender, sweet and covered with orgasmic truffle butter.  They claim everything on the menu is a 9oz portion, but the lobster tail did seem a bit small.  Could just be I wanted more it was so good or it just looked so lonely presented alone on such a big plate.  My wife adores swordfish but doesn't get it often with all the controversy these days.  She is happy she used the opportunity here to have it.  Perfectly blackened and very moist.  The spices were just right...so many times blackened items can be over spiced.  I'm not a big fish-fish eater but would order this anytime.  We split a side of Truffled Mac and Cheese.  OMG...I would love to make an entire meal out of this guilty pleasure sometime.  Even if it means not being able to walk for days.  The server told me a lot of the employees get there early so they can eat a bowl of it before work.  For dessert (like we should have even attempted at this point) we shared the monstrously huge Baked Alaska.  This too was fantastic.  It is made with Vanilla, Chocolate, and Black Raspberry ice cream they make there, sitting in chocolate and raspberry sauces, and covered with beautifully torched meringue.  It could easily have fed three or four.  The coffee is individually pressed at the table.  Very nice presentation but the coffee itself was quite bitter.  In terms of service our waitress was very friendly but a bit slow to check back.  I believe she was fairly new as she had to think a bit to describe the special and other dishes.  But, she had a great smile and was very nice so not a problem.  Bottom line, this is a great seafood restaurant that I can't wait to go back to!

My first box of NGD arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as I removed the produce from the box.  I haven't seen such beautiful, fresh, well packaged produce since I was a kid (and I'm no spring chicken).  The carrots tasted like the sweet carrots I remember and the lettuce (with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves) so full of flavor.  The amazing thing is that I had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with NGD.  The medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four.  It is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am.  The unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call Phoenix.  Furthermore, I live way out in Carefree/Cave Creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery.  Not with NGD.  It appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas.   Finally, there is a gentleman named Ben that works for NGD.  He has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly.  We think NGD is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and HIGHLY recommend NGD!

The little bundlets are amazing.  All you cupcake lovers need to run over here and try these.  I bought the marble, carrot, and white chocolate raspberry.  These little babies are moist as can be.  The White Chocolate Raspberry will make your eyes roll up into the back of your head as you moan with delight!  The really cool thing is the way the hole is filled with frosting.  That way frosting lovers can take the sugar train to jittersville and those that don't like so much can eat around it...no more frosting amount debates.  Finally, the customer service was great.  The lady behind the counter was very helpful with suggestions.  I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors.

Los Mesquites just recently opened where I think the old Leland's restaurant was located several years ago.  It's nice to see a mexican restaurant open to compete with El Encanto.    The food was a solid four stars.  They make their own chips and salsa.  The salsa is mild with the flavors of fresh fire roasted tomato and mexican oregano as primary ingredients.  Best of all I didn't detect any cilantro (sorry fans but I am one of "those" cilantro haters).  The lunch specials are reasonable at $5.95 - $8.95 for versions of their dinner offerings.  My wife had the taco salad with grilled chicken.  She enjoyed it very much.  The shell was freshly made and the salad was very generous for a lunch portion...lots of chicken.  One nice thing is they put enough lettuce in the salad.  Seems many taco salads are light on the greens.  I had a Chile Relleno.  It was fairly spicy, nicely battered, and lightly fried.  I appreciate the plate not dripping with grease like many Chile Relleno dinners do.  The best part was the homemade corn tortilla the Carne Asada taco came in.  This was a wonderfully thick creation with a great masa flavor.  I will definitely order something that comes wrapped in these next time!  Finally, the service was a four star attempt with three star results.  I chalk it up to being new, but there was a little difficulty getting orders straight between the tables, and some tables waiting 30 minutes for food while others waited 10.  But the servers and owner (?) were very nice and explained what happened to the customers.  Our service was great and I'm sure closer to what you can expect.

The new location for UL is pretty well tucked away at the end of the new AJ's Shopping center but it is well worth finding.  Sounds like there were some issues they had to get over when they first opened but my experience was great!  Went for an early dinner at about 6 pm.  The service was prompt and our server was very friendly.  We ordered a Mediterranean pizza and Penne with Wild Mushrooms in Cream Sauce.  The Penne was amazing.  A wonderful mixture of different mushrooms in a delicate cream sauce over perfectly al dente penne.   I'm sure it's a million calories but I could easily have snarfed down another serving!  The pizza combination of artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, banana pepper rings, etc was great.  The only reason I knocked a star off is the middle third of the pizza could have been crispier.  Of course that can be difficult with that many wet ingredients.  One side note for all you ladies with a fireman fetish.  There is a new fire station across the parking lot and the bar area was filled with at least a half dozen firemen.  So, if that's your cup of tea, then you might find someone to help put out your blazing inferno!

Decided to try Rustic Cafe for lunch today.  Looked at the Yelp reviews and on line menu thinking this is a place both my wife and I would enjoy.  Sometimes I'm in the breakfast mood and she's not so things looked promising.    We were seated quickly and received average service overall.  They certainly don't go out of their way to do anything extra.  You even have to butter your own toast (actually not butter but half melted Country Crock).  I got the feeling a great deal of the food is prepackaged.  My wife ordered the salad with smoked salmon.  The lettuce was not fresh and my wife had to pick out the pieces that were super wilted and sticking to the edible leaves.  Looked a lot like that grocery store packaged salad that's been sitting in the fridge a little too long.  The smoked salmon was maybe equal to two strips of lox.  It was torn into a few pieces and rolled up so it would look bigger...which it did compared to what was essentially a side salad.  Very disappointed for $10.    I had the Greek Skillet.  Two eggs over green peppers, "gyro" meat, olives, feta, and onions.  Served with side of hash browns and toast.  First, several reviews mention the cold hash browns.  Believe it..they are served barely warm.  They are flavorless as they are simply potatoes without onions or any other flavors.  The Greek Skillet was fair.  The gyro meat is the prefab strips, not nearly as good as many fast food places serve.    No reason to return.

Without a doubt the best cheeseburger/fries combo this Chicago bred and born carnivore has ever had at a restaurant.  Fresh beef formed into a patty in front of your eyes as it is slapped on the grill.  They come off wonderfully charred and juicy.  It was topped with their fantastic sauce, crisp FRESH lettuce, onion, and tomatoes and...fresh sliced, thick cut, dill pickle slices.  The cheese is real cheddar not processed or liquid cheese.  I order mine "hot" which includes homemade giardinara.    The fries are crinkle cut, golden on the outside, hot and steamy inside.  I always get an extra cup of the sauce they put on their burgers to dip the fries in.  Oh My is it good.  Trust me on this...the sauce is the bomb!  Although I love Italian beefs and Chicago dogs I haven't been able to tear myself away from the burger long enough to try.  When I do, I'll update this review...don't hold your breath though.  The help is always very friendly and always checks to make sure everything tastes alright.  I definitely feel much more appreciated here than most valley establishments.    All in all, Lobby's is so good that it has become a regular stop on my weekly lunch rotation.  I'd love it if they opened one up in the far north valley as well.

Been to Harvest three times now.  Once for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Breakfast is the star at Harvest.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was great.  In particular, the sausage gravy had big chunks of sausage and was nice and spicy.  Eggs over medium were just right with no runny whites but runny, warm yolks.   My wife had the lox plate and said it was both delicious and was very generous with the lox. Lunch was also very good.  Huge reasonably priced burgers grilled from fresh ground beef.  The Eggplant Burger was excellent (if not sloppy) with a couple of fried eggplant slices, mozzarella cheese, and red sauce surrounding the patty.  It also had lettuce and tomato on it which would have been better left on the side to add as one wishes.  The lettuce and tomato really don't go well with the Italian flavors.   For dinner we had Wiener schnitzel (SP?).  It was okay.  When I have had this dish in the past (can't spell that again!) the meat is usually pounded very thin and comes with noodles.  The meat was ordinary and a little chewier than schnitzel should be.  The crust was not well adhered as well.  Finally, the mashed potatoes were excellent, but would have preferred the traditional Spaetzle noodles. Service has been average and the folks working there are nice enough.  Nothing stands out good or bad regarding the service.  All in all, would probably be 3.5 stars if such a thing existed.  I'm going with 4 though because the prices are VERY reasonable for North Scottsdale.  I'll definitely be a regular for breakfast!

A couple of times in the last month I have gone here for lunch.  The fry bread here is very, very, good.  I love the crisp, brown, bubbly surface that makes these so addicting.  Both times the fry bread was served so hot I had to let it sit a couple of minutes before eating.  I had the red chili the first time and green the next.  They are both excellent but I really enjoyed the flavor of the hatch green chili in the green.  The beef itself is fall apart tender and quite flavorful in all those juices.  There is also a very nice, but not too spicy, hot sauce that enhances the flavor of the tacos.  Either way, there was so much filling in the fry bread I could only finish part with my hands.  Good thing there are plenty of paper towels!  Next time I hope to leave room for a honey topped fry bread for dessert and then drive immediately to the hospital before going home.  The ladies that work there are very quiet but nice.  You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.  The decor is definitely no frills..but hey...this is fry bread not prime rib.   Lastly, I really want to make this part of my bi-weekly restaurant rotation but I doubt I'd live to provide an update to this review.  What a way to go though!!!!

R&W was a very pleasant surprise for lunch.  We had a local dines coupon and decided to try it.  The atmosphere was great.   Classic rock playing in the background while we sat on the patio sipping our $5 a glass wine on a beautiful 75 degree afternoon.  After perusing the menu we decided to try the French Onion Soup Dumplings from the small plates menu along with fish and chips and a salad from the lunch menu.  The dumplings were amazing.  Filled with wonderful onions cooked in soup and covered in chewy, stringy cheese.  These little gems were worth every artery clogging bite.  Even my wife, who rarely will eat something this sinful, couldn't stop eating these.  The fish had a nice and crispy golden batter that was not greasy.  Very fresh white fish that was nice and mild.  The homemade tarter sauce was also very good.  Chips are really fried potato shreds.  Not traditional, but tasted good.    The service was also prompt and courteous.  It's also nice not to get a bit of a cross eyed look when you use a coupon.  It was graciously accepted.  When you have confidence in your restaurant having the opportunity to gain a new customer through a coupon is a great way to increase the traffic from local customers that will keep you going during the off season.  We'll be back for sure.  We go to Jalapeno's Inferno fairly often as it is our favorite Mexican food in the North Valley. These folks own Jalapeno's as well which tells me they have it "going on"!

Went for take out and was very disappointed.  Every dish tasted as though a salt shaker fell into the wok.  Extremely greasy too.  First time I ever threw Chinese food away after only a few bites.  Oh, nearly forgot...the fried rice was crunchy old.  Someday we will get good Chinese food in the far north valley.
