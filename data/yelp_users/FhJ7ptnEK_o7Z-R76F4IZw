Cool little place, huge selection, but they didn't have very many small vegetables which I was looking for, and we had someone offer us help right away when we walked in, but had to wait a couple minutes to be checked out. Overall, cool place and will probably be back.

Happy Hour is an awesome deal, especially if you have Tabetha serving you, she's the best!

Great spot to pick up what you need conveniently and open until 2am every night! The new owners and staff are super friendly and nice, if your on Hatcher they got what you need.

Never done me wrong, never noticed any drink specials and sometimes it takes awhile to get a drink but they have a million pool tables and a nice big patio

Excellent food and atmosphere. Tequila selection is the most ive ever seen, probably my favorite Mexican restaurant, sit in the bar if you can-small but fun.

Went in for a quick lunch, quick and friendly service and good prices. I had the Italiano sandwich which was delicious, and my girlfriend had the cheese ravioli with mushrooms which she said was 'bomb'!

I went to this store at 1:45 AM, they refused to sell me alcohol saying their clock was at 2:02. We showed him our phones to show the time and he still denied. He was rude and disrespectful and did not conform to governmental law. He proceeded to argue with us for 10 minutes until our own phones read 2AM, then laughed at us. I am displeased and want something done about this disrespectful and dishonest employees.

This place is terrible. Told my gf they have her phone fixed before 4pm, she had to go to work so I stopped in to pick it up at 7pm, besides the fact it wasn't done, they told me it wasn't even in the store and 'their guy' took it home to fix it but did not have the right parts. I told them I need to have the phone done ASAP or I want a refund, an 'their guy' came and dropped it off fixed. SUPER SKETCHY-definitely avoid this place

Me and my girlfriend decided to stop in for a quick lunch, but my slice and wings and her sub took almost an hr when they said it'd be 20 minutes. Mind you the place is dead and only other customer was a pick up. I won't be going back but I did give it 2 stars because the pizza and sub were huge.
