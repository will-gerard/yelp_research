Want a great little caf√©!  Wait staff was very attentive and overall on top of things. Our little girl loved watching the planes take off while she enjoyed her pancakes!  The chicken fried steak is a must have with hash browns. We will be back!

WOW!  WOW!  WOW!  Why have we not been to this place before?  Everything and I mean everything we had was amazing. The service was quick and personal. I am a huge eggs Benedict fan and their's is the best I have ever had, hands down!  Bloody Mary's yum!  Hubby had the cornbread rancheros and didn't talk the until they were gone. So they must have been good!  Can't wait to get back here!

Went here over the weekend with our friends for a birthday. What happen?  Our server terry was not on top of it at all and the food was baaaad.  The other server actually told us the bartender sucks, so only order beer and shots. Of course she was right. The margarita my hubby ordered was rank.  Get it together guys and we might come back. Hate that we wasted so much money there with our group.

Yummy brunch this morning at brio. Ordered the Bennie and hubby got the French toast. Amazing!!  Only problem was, we asked for the heater to be turned on about 4 times and then Bloody Mary had to be remade. Otherwise a great time

We tried this for the first time tonight and we were extremely surprised!  The restaurant has a beautiful patio. The customer service was amazing.   The food is fresh Mexican with a twist!  We will definitely be back.

Meh....not really sure what the hype is all about?  The food is not that great and the prices are outrageous!  Had the chopped salad and it was good, we have had something similar before though. My hubby had the scallops and I had the grilled cheese. Nothing wow about either one. We can say we went, we tried, we defiantly  payed but we will not be going back.  Sorry

Went to The Spot the other morning with my girlfriend for brunch. Let me just say, AMAZING!!  I ordered the veggie scrambler and it was a blend of flavors that truly impressed me. Will defiantly return!

My husband and I are building a house in Gilbert and wanted to have a company look at our new AC before we closed. Called the dukes and it was easy to set up an apt around my schedule!  I was truly impressed with John's knowledge and tips for our new unit.  I would highly recommend them. Thanks so much again!

This place is gross and sooo over priced!  You really are better off going to Taco Bell. Serve some authentic Mexican food and do it fast, otherwise I see this being a failed business.

This place is so gross!  Stale bread, rude employees and a boring sandwich makes for a place we will never visit again. Sorry jimmy you will never see another dollar from me.  Go to jersey mikes it's way better!

Food was okay, unfortunately the service is the worst.  Being the only breakfast place around (for now) took way to long to get a table. Then once we did get seated and order, waited over an hour for food. To bad
