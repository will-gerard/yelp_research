I order the Buffalo 66, The Veggie Jackson and the Se√±orita no meata, all very delicious. I've had the Prince of Thai and it was good but I think I expected a bit more. The Gringo Star was bland and nothing I'd ever order again. If you are in the mood for a Mexican burrito, go to a Mexican joint - otherwise if you want a delicious wrap, go with another selection from the menu.

LOVE the mozzarella, tomato & basil sandwich!!! They use local vegetables and make the mozzarella and wood-fired focaccia at the location. Simplicity at it's best!  Definitely a local favorite!

I'm a big fan of Roscoe's in LA and always hoped to find something along the same lines here, in my home state. While Lolo's isn't quite Roscoe's, it is still quite delicious. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Thankfully we ordered pick-up, because the line was a half hour wait, just to be seated. It's a popular spot.  The chicken and waffle combo was very tasty, but their fried okra wasn't the best and the lemonade was too sweet.  I am still pleasantly full by this comfort food gem in downtown Phoenix and would recommend this to anyone.

I just took my Yorkie Luna to 'A Family Affair' today, it was our first visit. My Yorkie can be a very bad girl when it comes to grooming and sometimes it takes groomers a bit longer to finish her. Not only was she done sooner than I was told, but they did a GREAT job!   I also love that they don't use cages and they also offer teeth cleaning with no anesthesia. I HIGHLY recommend taking your pet to 'A Family Affair' I was very pleased.

The Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos are AMAZING. These tacos have really impressed me. The horchata is also a great treat. They add strawberry, melon and nuts. I'm not vegetarian but i try not to eat so much meat and their veggie tacos are sooo good. Cheese, peppers, onions and mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I took away 1 star because sometimes the service is very slow, although i will say the last time i went they seemed to be working on it.

I hardly ever take the time to write out a review, but this experience could not go ignored. I would  have much rather spent my hard earned money elsewhere.   The glass that separates you and the ordering counter must make it hard for them to hear, I had to repeat myself constantly. It would've been helpful to have been told that from the get go instead of figuring it out at the end.   I asked for a sample of the chicken because I've never been and was having a hard time ordering, the guy looked at me like I was stupid for asking. I pointed at little plastic containers they had by the meat and said that they must obviously give samples. He finally let me try a bit.  It was a big ordeal to find out how long of a wait it was for the green chile pork to come out. I had to ask him like 4  different times if he would just make one with the little bit that was left. He acted annoyed for having to scoop out the meat that was left because it required a bit more effort.   The lady at the checkout was rude when I asked if I could pay while I waited for it to finish cooking.  She ignored us until I asked for drink cups. All in all, the food was ok (the tortilla soup was a massive disappointment, they don't even put tortilla in it. Don't order it if you are a fan of tortilla soup, the flavor was off), the service sucks and the line is a cluster f***k. At least chipotle has an efficient and friendly assembly line. I will not be returning. Much better places to support in the area.

Delicious breakfast. They text to notify you when your table is ready. Plus they have a ping pong table and games to keep you entertained during your wait. This helped a lot with our 9 yr old. Barely noticed the time go by. Free coffee and good music. Good brunch spot for the central phoenix folk. Any place that has a good selection of eggs benedict wins with me.
