the only thing worse than a broken phone is when your "slide to unlock" is now the slide of death.  Fingers bleeding EVERY time.  Miles came to MY workplace and fixed my sad looking phone.  The repair only took about 10 WHOLE minutes.  Great customer service AND a great price !? Can't beat it.

It should never ever  - ever EVER take 30 minutes to get a burrito bowl, no matter how long the line is.  Yes, it was lunch time but management should have this under control.  2 stars only because I heart chipotle.
