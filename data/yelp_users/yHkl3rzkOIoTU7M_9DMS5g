Alrighty, I'm not the most regular regular to Coffee Rush, but as I do work across the street, I'm there fairly often.  Its a small place (as is the parking lot in front, spots are definitely at a premium, I wish you luck!), nice and quiet on the inside, with plenty of seating, and an area with computers (internet code comes with drink purchase should you desire to use it. So its not really "free" wi-fi, per se, but "if you buy from us you can use our internet, till the code expires in a few hours, and you need to buy another drink from us to get a new, active code" wi-fi). Outside, there's a scattering of tables, ashtrays, and lakefront seating. Lakefront seating you say? In Arizona? Well, you better believe it. Sitting on the corner of a man-made lake for an apartment and condo community, those who are so inclined can start the morning (or end their days) sitting by the lake, enjoying the ducks, and the view of the water, and whatever beverage you have purchased to wet your whistle.  Pretty calming if you ask me, but, hell, I grew up on LI, NY surrounded by water, so it might just be a bit of a bias, based on the fact that, well, I grew up on an island. Which means you should take my advice: sitting and listening to water flow and watching the lake is calming.   But what about the drinks, you say'? They are the reason you go to a coffee shop, so sure, I'll get on with the drinks. Get. The. Coffee. It's good. There isn't much other ways to say it. Get the coffee, its good, you won't be disappointed. You can fancy it up with milk and sugar, or drink it straight up black. Its just good coffee. If you down for the other drinks, The Frosts are pretty good as well (blended ice, mocha, flavored syrup of your choice, and espresso). They tend to be a bit on the pricier side (6$+/drink), but if you're willing to drop the dough, they are pretty tasty. Iced Tea wise, they have your standard regular unsweetened tea, which is good, a green tea, and I'm not sure, but I think they'll drop  bit of flavoring syrup into the tea should you desire. Unfortunately, the iced tea only comes in one size. It's pretty good tea, but I suck down the approx 16 oz cup way too quickly. If they'd serve it to you in the giant Frost cups, then all would be right with the world, but alas they wont, and you're forced to go back and pay for a refill sooner rather than later.   All in all, good coffee, good (albeit small sized) iced tea, semi-free wi-fi, and relaxing lake front setting. I return every few weeks, so it can't be that bad, can it?

Alrighty, if you've been down to "The Bean" anytime in the last year, you've more than likely seen my mug around there. It has slowly become my home away from home, so I feel fairly competent in giving a well rounded opinion.   First off, as has been said by others, one of The Bean's best qualities is the fact that it is open 24 hours on the weekends (Friday 5 am - Sunday 11 pm). This works out wonderfully for us 21+ who don't want the night to end after the bar's throw us out to the streets. Basically, its a "you can't stay here, but you can go to The Bean" kind of situation. For the rest of the week, it is open from 5 am till 11 pm, giving us night owls a place to hang around.   Now I can get a bit into the drink and food. If you're coming to The Bean, you know the coffee is alright. It's certainly not the best cup you will get in AZ, but they do roast their own beans on premises a few times a week (ensuring a pretty fresh cup of joe). You can tell the roasting days by the smoke coming off the chimney, and the acrid, dizzying, and often intoxicating scent, suffocating the area. If the coffee is to your liking, you can purchase it to bring home, whole or pre-ground. Offering your standard array of drip, french press, espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, etc..., all available served hot or cold,  Xtreme Bean has your coffee fix, well, fixed.  For those of you not coffee inclined, the Bean offer's a large array of loose leaf teas, which you can mix and match to make your own creation (May I be allowed to recommend a Black Currant/Moroccan Mint blend, on ice?). Green teas, decaf, black, the have it all. Also offered: creme blended drinks, italian sodas in a plethora of flavors, Naked Juice.  Food wise, they keep it pretty simple at the The Bean. Made fresh every 2 days, they have salads, sandwich's, and pita wraps, as well as a grand assortment of pastries (if you get there before noon, after which the pastries are usually gone) The wraps are alright, sandwich's are ok. It's all edible, and priced a bit higher then what its worth. Bagels, muffins, doughnuts, cookies, slices of cake, and usually some sort of banana bread all grace the food cooler.   Moving on to seating, its pretty sacred reality if you get there during peak hours. With plenty of electrical sockets inside, in the floors and in the walls, The Bean is highly lap top friendly. The Internet connection is free, but it can border on agonizingly slow when there are numerous people using it. The aptly named Vault (The Bean IS located in what at one point was a bank) is generally known to be the quiet study section. Outside, there are your standard tables and chairs, most of which are falling apart, or wobbly, or bent. During the nights it can be difficult to impossible to find a spot, especially once it gets nice out. If you aren't a fan of smokers, then you may want to sit inside as nearly the entire patio is smoker friendly (even if the ashtrays mysteriously disappear every few months).   Every few nights, they have some sort of live music being played. Monday nights is given over to the piano and classic show tunes crowd, who, as you guessed, sing show tunes and take turns playing the piano. Loudly, might I add. Loudly, and incessantly, and they take over the majority of the seats inside. If you need to get work done on a Monday, move into the Vault (where its kind of quieter) or go outside. Friday nights are a rotation of performers, usually a single guitarist with an amp. These performers usually add more ambiance than annoyance to the atmosphere, so even if you are going to the shop to sit and talk with people, you can do just that without getting drowned out by the musicians. Be sure to request Freebird, one day someone will actually play it.   I'm beginning to think I've rambled enough for now, but I'm fairly certain you've gotten a decent picture. Good for the people, the socialization, the place to go on weekends after, literally, everything else in Tempe has closed. If you're ever down to The Bean, feel free to say hello if you see me on the patio!

Last night I decided it was time to venture out a bit and headed into Scottsdale for a few beers. It was not the first time I've been to Papago; it won't be the last either. I'll be going back there many a time, that's for certain. I'm a creature of habit, and Papago could be a newly formed addiction.  I'm going to start this off by getting 2 negatives off my chest: no patio and closes really early during the week. Thats all. I'm not going to overly complain, because if you really want to go out side, just leave the front door and hang out on the sidewalk. Sure you can't bring your beer, but its a small sacrifice. And the hours: they close at 11:30 during the week. If they were open later, I would be seen there more often than I am, considering it's less than 10 min up the road from my apartment.   BUT, now on to the good stuff: BEER! There is the beer. Jimminy Cricket, there is the beer. Tons and tons of beer. They have hundreds of bottles in a walk up freezer where you grab a beer, bring it to a bartender who will open it and charge you, and then you can go back to your table. (Note about tables: I'm short, clocking in at a whopping 5'2". At all but a select few of the plenteous seating options, my feet swing freely, not touching the ground) They don't have "Everything everything" but they do have hundreds of microbrews from around the country, and world, ranging from bottles of Foxbarrel Cider to a 43.99$ bottle of Prestige. Yes, they sell a 43$ bottle of beer. Serious beer for serious beer drinkers. I unfortunately did not splurge on this extravagant expense and decided that I would go with something on tap.   First rule of Papago: You do not ask the bartender to run through what they have on tap. You'll be there for hours. On a good night, they run 20+ beers on tap. Yes. 20. Beers. On. Tap. It's an adventure just looking at the tap handles. In order to stream line the ordering process, and saving themselves the problem of having to memorize exactly whats on tap, they have a beer folder, with a list of the beers on tap, listing Brewery Name, Location, Beer Name, Beer style. If you can't make a decision for yourself, certainly ask the bartenders, who are all really friendly and well versed in all the beers. Last night I went with Stone Ruination IPA and a Breckenridge 471. Yeah, Ruination and 471 on tap at the same time in the same place. You cannot beat that. 471 was served to me in a snifter glass because of its awesomely high Alc/vol (a staggering 9.2%). You will find a beer here that you like. I promise. Also, it is worth mentioning that Papago brews their own beer. Right now they have a seasonal, Orange Blossom, which is basically a creamsicle in a glass. Not my personal cup of tea (which i'm sure you can tell), but from what I hear it's amazing. Give it a go if you like sweeter/fruitier beers.  This is normally where I would talk about something other then the seating or the beer, like, maybe the food because they have a full kitchen, but I've never ate there. Based on the level of service, I'm sure the food is fine, falling in the acceptable range of Bar Food. The menu looked appetizing, with hand tossed and stretched pizza's, sandwiches, salads, nacho's, etc. I'll update this with a food review sometime in the near future.

I'll admit it. I'm a card carrying Music Junkie. I have been since Hoodlums was located in the basement of the MU at ASU Main Campus. I even have the t-shirt and paper ID card to prove it.   I was sorely disappointed when the MU fire forced hoodlums to close down and move, and figured it was the end of an era. No more spending lunch money on used movies and music. No more spending hours thumbing through each and every CD or vinyl in the store. No more days spent listening to artists I'd never heard of before, only to drop my last nickles and dimes to get their latest album. Hoodlums is solely responsible for my movie and music collection/addiction.  Then I went to Changing Hands a long while later, and what before my wondering eye's did appear? A record store! Hoodlums opened up in the center of Tempe, and has since become the center of a locally minded cadre of music lovers. What was even nicer was walking in, after what seemed like an eternity (but probably closer to a year), and hearing someone say "Hey Joe." Yes, my friends, it was the same crew working the store that had manned the registers downstairs at ASU, and they remembered who I was. If there is one thing to be said about these guys, it's that they treat their customers with the utmost respect and familiarity, remembering names, faces, and what kind of music/movies you enjoy. Talk about feeling right at home in store.   Ok, I'll stop spouting my love for this place for a moment and get on to a review. New and Used CD's, Movies, and an incredible, quickly growing vinyl section. If they don't have it, they probably can order it for you, and will do so gladly. Prices are all reasonable; its a local store, not a giant mega-corp, so they aren't gouging you on anything. The quality of the used items is good: they preview movies, cd's, and vinyl before they make it to the store sales floor. If there's a slight problem with the item, they'll either not take it, or make it known to the customer before buying it.  Check out the local shows that they put together with Changing Hands Books and Spraygraphic Art. From Album Art shows, to Record Store Day, to the  We Live Here yearly art show the monthly movie night, live in store sets and appearances, Hoodlums has transformed from a staple of ASU to a staple of Tempe.

I may as well write a review of Rula since already give over a healthy portion of my paycheck to them every weekend. I'm a fan. A Regular. The guy in the fedora who goes to other bars and gets asked "Hey, aren't you the regular over at Rula?" I'm also kind of biased, but i'm a Guiness fan. and I'm a cider fan. And Rula trained its bartenders on how to pour the perfect Snakebite (Yep, its Guiness and Cider, layerd. The Cider floats on the Guiness. Its neat-o!).   Ok, So. Rula. Probably has the largest back patio on Mill Ave, and on the weekends, it gets fill to the brim with every kind of stereotype that exists in the greater Phx area. Frat Boys mix with Foreign Exchange Students mix with Old Fogey's mix with Hipsters. And everyone gets along pretty much. When the occasional fight breaks out (as drunkards are wont to hit someone/thing at some point), Security breaks it up and gets the problem cleared away. Also, as its a large back patio with many tables, chairs, and people, and its a bar, people are going to be smoking. Cigars and cig's abound, and ashtrays as well.  If you don't want to be bothered by the smokers, feel free to meander through the crowd, back inside where, all the while on Friday and Saturday nights, there is really good live music playing (which, by the way, is who the 2$ cover to get in goes to). And for the most part, everyone gets along.  In the realm of food, Rula has the Irish fare down pat. The Boddington's Shrimp, the shepard's pie, the boxty, all are amazing, and decently priced. Don't come here and expect to order nachos and a second rate burger to add some flavor to your Coors and Bud Light's. They have real good food with real good beers. The servers are all friendly and quick, the management is pretty chill, and the over all feel of the place is relaxed. Its hard to feel tense while hanging out here.  Oh, and don't try to order beer from the bar back out back.  He's just so happens to be the best bar-back this side of the Mississippi, and keeps the outdoor bar running in top shape, but, trust me, as much as he wants to get you a beer and back amongst the masses, the poor guy is not allowed, no matter how much you bitch about it or how much money you try to throw at him. Wait for one of the bartenders, they'll gladly help you shortly.

About 2 weeks ago I moved into to an apartment complex that is 1/4 mile away from the intersection of Guadalupe and McClintock. At this intersection there is upwards of 10 different dinner choices, the majority of them chain restaurants or fast food. Being of the "shop local Tempe" mindset, I ventured to Macs Broiler & Tap, a mom and pop joint sandwiched between 2 of my favorite places in Tempe: Hoodlums Music and Changing Hands Bookstore. I figured since it was in such good company, I would give it a go.   I walked in the door and walked to the (empty) hostess stand where a sign read "Please wait to be seated." Being a good drone, I did just that, I stood there looking for the hostess for a good 3 minutes, waiting to be seated. Finally a girl busing tables looks over at me, apparently confused over why I'm just standing there, and says "You know you can just sit where ever you want." So I go and grab a table, situate myself. And I wait. And I wait some more. About 10 minutes later a waitress comes over to me and tells me that she will be right with me. Five minutes later, she comes back and asks if I would like a menu. At this point, I've now been in the place for about 20 minutes. I wanted to say "Yes, that would be just dandy. I would like a menu so i can order some food, which is the reason why I've been waiting 20 minutes." I bite my tongue and just say "Yes, thank you."  The waitress grabs a menu for me, doesn't stick around for me to ask for a drink, and walks away. She returns with a water 5 minutes later, putting it on the table as she walks by, not stopping to ask if I had any questions or want something other than water to drink. By now I've looked at the menu, figured out what I wanted, and wanted to order. I try flagging her down, finally catching her attention, only to get a curt "I'll be there in a moment." She meander's her way over, takes my order, and goes to walk away. I stop her and ask if I can get an iced tea with my meal and the look she gave me had to be akin the one she'd give someone who just demanded her 1st born child, a combination of confusion and incredulity and disbelief.   A bit later, she walks by again, nearly drops my iced tea onto the table (she never stopped walking), and continues on her way without a word. Armed with my glass of water and my reluctantly given iced tea, I began the long wait for my order, the Chicken melt sandwich. Continuing what appears to be the M.O. of Mac's, I waited for my sandwich. And I waited. And I waited. Then, get this:  I waited some more. I waited for over 35 minutes for my food, and not once did my waitress come around to see if i needed more water (i did) or more iced tea (I didn't, but could have used a top off on the glass as it's free refills). Just when I was about to flag the waitress down to ask why they didn't pluck, slaughter, and carve up the chicken into the appropriate parts BEFORE I placed my order, a she walks out of the kitchen with a plate in hand and brings a plate to my table, puts it down and walks away barely saying a word. In front of me is my chicken sandwich.   There was bread, chicken, bacon, cheese, and tomato's. Beautifully, they got my order correct. The cheese was melted, but kind of cold (as if it had been sitting there waiting for someone to bring it to my table), the bacon was very good. The chicken was a bit dry, but by this time, I was starving. All in all I was there for an hour before I got any food, and when I did finally get it, I was not about to voice a complaint and wait even longer. I understand that Mac's is not a fast food joint, nor was I expecting it to be. However, being "Joe, party of One" in a 1/4 full restaurant, I feel that I can expect to receive my food in WELL  under an hour. Hell, just by being by myself I should be in, fed, paid, and out in under an hour. The waitress never checked to see if the food was OK, never offered me refills on my water or tea, and basically pretended I didn't exist. For a local restaurant situated between two of Tempe's best Local businesses, I expected a lot more.   Needless to say, I am sorely disappointed with my experience at Mac's, what with high expectations due to positive reviews on here and from people I know. I never got my waitresses name and was basically treated as a nuisance and not as a paying customer, from the minute I walked in and stood at the empty hostess booth looking like an idiot to the minute I walked out the front door.    Bottom line? I could have gone to Trader Joe's to buy the ingredients, gone home, cooked, ate, and cleaned up in the time I wasted over at Mac's. Will I be returning anytime soon? Probably not.

I've been to Sahara Middle Eastern twice. The first time that I went there, I really did enjoy myself. I went with a buddy for lunch, I had the gyro pita and he had the chicken schawarma pita. The food was delicious, served quickly. The food didn't last long on our plates; it was totally devoured after the first bite. The rice was great. everything cooked to perfection. I made a promise to myself to return again soon. So I did.   The second time I went, I had talked another one of my friends into going. He's not the biggest middle eastern food fan, but he aquiesced and we went over. We show up, see the "Open" sing hanging in the door, the electronic open sign flashing in the window, pull the door, open, and walk in. We are promptly met and seated near a couple of people who were eating, by a woman who gives us menu's and a few minutes to pick out what we want; In the mean time she brought us some water. After we decide what to have, the owner, presumably, walks in from outside, looks at us, and walks over, and tells us that the restaurant is closed. We nervously glanced at each other, and because we thought he was joking, chuckled politely and placed out order. After all, we'd been seated, given silverware, menus, water, and time to decide what to eat. Well, turns out he wasn't kidding. And he apparently thought we were laughing maliciously at him. He grabbed my menu from my hands, told us to get out, that the restaurant was closed, pointed to the door,  and that we need to learn to read signs. Effectively, we were thrown out of the restaurant, and left without commotion or a word to him other than "ok, ok, we're sorry." Sorry for what, other than wanting to patronize a restaurant which I had previously enjoyed, I don't know. Outside, confused, we looked on the door, and saw the open/close times. They close at 2:45; we looked at our watches, it was 2:55.   I can understand we walked in right at 2:45. I understand that the hours of operation were posted (albeit, in tiny print), and that we should have seen them. However, it is in Tempe, a college town, in the early afternoon. There were people inside eating. The open sign was showing, as well as the flashing neon sign. We were seated, given water. Only to be unceremoniously thrown out over what was a misunderstanding. The whole fiasco could have been handled better, and it has left a poor taste in my mouth. I won't be returning any time soon.  Bottom line, yes, the food is delicious. I recommend the Gyro pita if you do find yourself here (It's the only reason I'm not giving them a 1 star). However, the treatment we received was completely uncalled for. We seem to be the only people who have received such treatment here, so I hope it was a fluke and the gentleman was merely having a bad day.

I'm a coffee shop fiend, and can be found hanging around Xtreme Bean and Goldbar (though not much of late). After sucking down iced tea and coffee all morning, I (like everyone else out there) tend to need something in my stomach other than liquid and caffeine. When this is the case, I head to Lobby's Beef Burgers and Dogs.   Honestly, I was highly skeptical prior to my first visit. A one off restaurant, with limited word of mouth, that deals in cheeseburgers, dogs, and Italian beef and sausage. Chicago style, at that.  (Ok, I'm a born and raised NY'er, so my bias was seeping in a bit). I decided i was give them a month or 2 after they opened to try them out. After all, they basically deal with fast food, and if If i wanted that, hell, I'd go to McD's. Taco Bell, or Jack's, all of which are within a literal stones throw from Lobby's door.    Finally caved one day, and walked my fedora capped self across the street to Lobby's, ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger, and in all honesty, was taken by surprise. Burger meat at Lobby's is fresh ground, the buns are tasty, the bacon is crisp. And juicy. All of which are vital to a successful Bacon Cheese burger. I normally get my order as a Combo (which includes a Bucket o' Soda, and crinkle fry's only made when you order them). Its almost 3 bucks more, but well worth it. Rarely will a burger, fry's, and a drink leave me stuffed, but Lobby's does it every time.   They also have here what I consider to be the best Italian beef in the valley. Hands down. Now, my opinion may not be equivalent to that of some food critic, but the beef here is awesome. Thinly sliced, cooked in its juices, with cheddar or provolone cheese, its a hell of a sandwich. You can get it Hot or Sweet (if you are a pepper person, which I am), for extra cost,  or you can get it plain. Admit defeat before it gets your table, you're going to need a fork to eat the remains that fall out. Did I mention that the beef is piled in the bread to overflowing? And covered in juice? I mean drowned. Drenched. If you're at all like me and like your Italian beef swimming, Lobby's does it perfectly.   Also, the staff here kicks ass. Everyone is really friendly, helpful, and takes pride in their food. If you're staying to eat there, you won't get out without someone genuinely asking if everything was good.

I've been craving a good roast beef sandwich for a few days now, and finally had the chance to venture out someplace new to fill the near bottomless pit that is my stomach. This afternoon, my quest for a Roast Beef sandwich lead me to Jimmy Johns. And I will resume my search tomorrow, because, frankly, I was far from impressed with JJ's. And almost want my money back.   As stated, I wanted roast beef, and when i walked in and looked at the board, saw, what they have dubbed "The Hunter's Club," a sandwich purporting to have 1/4 lb roast beef, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and provolone. Bingo! That's what I wanted, so that's what I ordered. I rounded out my order with the combo, a medium drink and a bag of chips for 2$ more. Total came to 8 bucks and change for what I assumed would be the large.   Well, its a one size fits all kinda place. Sandwich was barely larger then your standard medium at any other sandwich shop. Also, it wasn't cut in half, which isn't a big deal, but what I assumed was standard operating procedure for anything larger than a "small" is to cut the damned thing in half so you don't poke someone in the face with the far end of your unwieldy edible. I ripped it in half myself, and when I went to get napkins, well, there weren't any to be seen. Had to ask at the counter for a couple. The girl gave me 1.   Anyway, the sandwich. When I ripped it in half, I noticed that there was more lettuce than anything in the sandwich, and when I bit into it, my suspicions were confirmed. I was eating a Lettuce, Tomato, Provolone and Mayo sandwich. Oh, there was roast beef on there, but you could barely tell. I couldn't, to be honest. It was magical, my eye's said "Hey look! Roast Beef! We Have Roastbeef!!!" by my tongue said "WTF Eyes, are you kidding me? There's no roastbeef here! Trust me, i'm swirling around the damn product and can't tell its there! It's a monstrosity of Mayo, Lettuce, more Mayo, and Lettuce, and what I assume to be cheese! You lie, Eyes! You Lie!" Totally dejected and disappointed, I finished my near 9 dollar, 8 inch lettuce sandwich, and delved into the chips.   Chips, can't screw those up, right? Right. Well, maybe kinda. JJ has their own house chips, highly reminiscent of the Kettle Chips. Not bad, just really really REALLY salty. Caked in salt. I have no problem with salt, chips should have salt on them. That's fine by me, I enjoy me my salty chips. But this was like a salt lick. I'm sure some people enjoy them, but not my cup of tea. Speaking of cup of tea, that's what I had to drink. Lipton brewed Iced Tea. Best part of the meal, aside from leaving. And determining not to go back.   They deliver as well, proudly stating they will deliver even 1 sandwich. Silvermine does it. Cheba Hut does it. Dilly's Deli does it. Congrats, you've joined the guild of delivery sandwich shops, all of whom will deliver 1 sandwich.   Come here only if you're a fan of generic, near tasteless food, that's over priced.
