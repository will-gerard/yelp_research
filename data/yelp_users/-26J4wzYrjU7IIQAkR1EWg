Do yourself a favor and GO TO STUMPYS!!   Seriously this is why I love Yelp! Finding small, local places to eat that are off the charts!   Unassuming, in a nondescript strip mall, but as soon as we walked in, and I smelled the sauce, I knew I was in for something good!   The employees were all super friendly, giving recommendations, getting our order to the line fast. Our food was out pretty quick, considering it was during the lunch rush and everything is made fresh.   Our group got a few different slices and we all loved them! Thin, crispy crust, flavor packed sauce, fresh cheese, awesome toppings. The pizza was so, so good! They even offered to cut my kids slices into small pieces to make it easier for them to eat, which was so nice!   I love that they offer slices, but make them fresh, sauce, cheese, and toppings, instead of reheating slices of a premade pizza like other places.   Our group left all giving it 5 stars!!

When it is over 110' in AZ and I am a cranky and sweaty mess, a fountain drink with pebble ice in a styrofoam cup is at the top of my list of needs.   I was shocked to see the low stars for this Sonic location. I mean, yes it is Sonic and the food is pretty terrible, but the drinks?! You just can't beat em!   And this location had super fast service and our car hops were very friendly! I was impressed!   Route 44 Diet Coke with lime for life!

Pretty good hotel in Mesa.  I was in town for the Phoenix Marathon and this hotel was conveniently located near the finish line/expo/bus pick up.   Check-in was easy and they had giant candy dispenser on the desk for guests consumption. Yes!   Rooms were very clean & spacious. Updated granite and fixtures in the bathrooms. Other finishings were a little outdated - popcorn ceiling, old (thin) moldings and baseboards, etc. But everything was clean and well maintained.    We visited the pool and while it wasn't heated (visiting in February), we were able to use the hot tub and small kiddie pool that was warm because it was shallow.   Also visited the executive lounge for breakfast and they had good offerings - oatmeal, eggs, bagels, breakfast pastries, coffee, juice.   Although I won't be running the Marathon again, if I needed a place to stay in Mesa, I'd definitely stay here again.

When it is over 110' in AZ and I am a cranky and sweaty mess, a fountain drink with pebble ice in a styrofoam cup is at the top of my list of needs.   Sadly this location was not the best, or even close to it, that I've been to. The woman taking my order was rude and not very helpful. It took forever(!!!) for our drinks to come out. I should have timed it, but it was way too long for just some soda and slushes. And then, we were only given 3 straws for 6 drinks, and then the car hop was gone, so we had to push the button again to summon them for more. It was just kind of an inconvenience, after the slow service, when I was so hot and just wanted to gulp my soda.

Overall, a pretty decent resort. Not the best or most glam, but nice and a great value.   Staff was very friendly!   Our room was clean and spacious. It wasn't the most modern and updated room, but pretty nice had everything we needed. I liked how the bathroom was in between the bedroom and living area, to provide a little sound barrier between the rooms while we slept.   Very conveniently located right off the freeway.   The pool area of the resort is what brought us to the property and it was overall very good! A huge pool with wading area at one end, volleyball net mid-way, and rock waterfalls to swim through and under at the other end. My boys loved this! A water slide, kiddie pool (that was too warm when we visited in mid-August), another more low-key pool for swimming, and lazy river were great additional areas to enjoy. The lazy river was maybe the laziest I have ever been in - a little too lazy and slow. Wish there was just a little more push. And one evening, they had it closed because there was broken glass, but there were no posted signs (we heard via word of mouth) and we saw no one cleaning it up either.   Plenty of (non-covered) parking.

2.5 stars.   Came in for breakfast since it is at our hotel (convenient) and was one of a few places that could easily accommodate our very large party (12 adults, 7 kids). I wasn't expecting much, since most of the reviews are middle of the road, but still left feeling a little underwhelmed.  Service was good and I appreciate that our server was able to handle such a large group without our drinks being empty and plates quickly bussed.   The food was just so-so. We had both orders off their menu and a few who opted for the breakfast buffet.   The buffet was large - yogurt station, fruit, cereal, made to order omelets, French toast, pancakes, potatoes, eggs, bacon & sausage, assorted pastries.   I had a made to order omelet and it was pretty greasy - way too much cooking oil used. The pastries were alright, potatoes were good. The juice station didn't have OJ(?). It was kind of your standard, sub-par breakfast buffet. But the price seemed way too high ($16.95); I feel like $12.95 would have been a little more appropriate. I did appreciate that kids under 5 were free for the buffet. Helps balance the higher cost of the adults I suppose.   My husband ordered the Nutella French toast and it was good, my mom had the pineapple pancakes and didn't eat more than 1 because they weren't very good, and the eggs Benedict my dad ordered was just okay.

Still on my Ragnar high!!!   Anyone who loves running needs to put a Ragnar on their bucket list. So fun!   This was my first Ragnar Relay, so I can only compare it to other races in general, but there were some definite pros and cons about this Relay.   The basics:  - 12 man team (or 6 if you go ultra).  - Each runner picks what runner number they want to be and you run three legs, predetermined by Ragnar. I was runner 9, and ran the same 3 legs as all runner 9s.  - 2 Vans of 6 runners. When your van is running, you support your runner (cheering, water breaks). When your van is off, you can go and rest, eat, shower, etc.  - There are exchange points where runners pass a slap bracelet baton. The volunteers call out the race bib number of the approaching runner, so your next runner can be waiting in the box (you have to exchange in the orange caution tape areas) to start. Ragnar volunteers write down your team bib number and the time you exchanged, to make sure that there is no cheating (skipping a leg).   Pros:  - Race communication goes through a team captain.  - Start times are staggered (teams with slower projected finish times start the earliest), every half hour, with no more than 20 teams starting at once, making it not congested at all! - Exchanges (Usually at parks or local churches) had plenty of parking and restrooms (porta potties and/or public restrooms) - Finish line was super efficient! After your team runs through (your whole team can run through together!) you are handed a packet with 12 medals and stickers.  Cons: - While the race app was nice to have (maps, elevation directions to exchanges, race bible), many of the legs had the wrong start/finish and elevation posted; it was flipped. So what looked like a all downhill leg was in actuality and all UPHILL leg. No Bueno!  - Sometimes the exchanges were very far from parking.  - Most legs were pretty clear, but a couple did not have good signage posted so there was some confusion on which way to go.  - A few legs were a different distance that what was posted (I was supposed to do a 5.1, 6.1, and 3.5 and the actual legs ending up being 5.1, 5.25, and 2.5).   Overall, the pros far outweighed the cons. The race was so much fun, running on no sleep is not for the faint of heart, but you'll never forget it!   And! My team took 2nd place for all women's teams. Booyah!!!

On a recent trip to Phoenix, I came to s.e.e.d. for breakfast, based on the Yelp reviews alone, excited to get something healthy to start my day. My vacation food choices get progressively less healthy as the day goes on, so I like to start off on a good note.   The cafe area is really nice - modern, industrial feel, with high gloss tables and chairs, orange accents to the metal and fresh green plants on each table. Paired next to a spin and yoga studio, but with its own entrance on one side.   The menu has more categories than I expected (juices, smoothies, bowls, oatmeal, burritos, light lunch), but not a ton of options in each category (maybe 2-5 per).   The employee taking our order was very nice, answered some questions. My party ordered an original acai bowl, a couple smoothies (dragon slayer & 3 month paid vacation), and a breakfast burrito (all in one).   Everything tasted very fresh, quality ingredients, and very tasty! I loved both smoothies and the burrito, although a little on the small side, was very good. The acai bowl had a layer of organic yogurt on the bottom, which I've never seen before, but I liked the creaminess it added.   Only hang ups are that it is a little on the pricy side compared to other juice and smoothie bars (and I'm even used to paying CA prices!), service time to make our items was a little slow. Also I asked and was told the acai bowl was served with blueberries, strawberries, and bananas, and asked for no blueberries. When I got the bowl it had tons of blue berries and no bananas, which was a bummer.   Bottom line, if you are in the area and want a healthy and delicious drink, come on in and you'll leave happy!

Okay I am SkinnyFats newest fan!! Officially obsessed. Such a unique concept - healthy side & happy (unhealthy) side and such a diverse menu. Everyone can be happy!   Employees were so friendly. Decor is awesome - industrial and funky, totally fun. Easy to drive past at night, not a lot of lights or signage in the industrial park, but somehow makes it feel a little more low key and cool.   I had the flat chicken & greens, plus avocado, per the employees suggestion and it was amazing! My husband had the fried chicken & waffle and really enjoyed it.   Price point is spot on. Food is quality for a great price, portions are perfect.   Hope to make it back this trip, and will definitely come next time I'm in Vegas!

Most Wanted Taco gets all the stars and more!!!! I was blown away! Such a great local owned spot, with owners who take pride in their product! So glad we found this gem!!   When we walked in, one of the women asked if we had been in before, and when we said we hadn't, she gave us each a fork and started filling sample cups one at a time, letting us sample every.single.meat they offered! Without us even asking. She just really wanted us to taste everything. I can't even remember the last time I had such awesome welcoming service!   They have several types of chicken, beef, and pork, with several different levels of spiciness in each. After they add the meat, you can pick what other toppings you want - raw or pickled onions, cilantro, cabbage, shredded romaine, cheese, sour cream, corn.   I had two small tacos (on corn vs. the large on flour) - one creamed chicken and one carnitas. The creamed chicken was so tender and super spicy (rated 3 chilies, their hottest) and even though my mouth was on fire, it was amazing! The carnitas were tender and flavorful and when you order, they take it from the hot line and put it on the grill to crisp it up. Authentic and delicious! I kept my tacos simple with cilantro, pickled onions, and sour cream and they were perfect! Everyone in my group loved their tacos!!!   The only thing that wasn't off the charts was their guacamole, sadly. It was pretty bland, needed a little more salt and/or lime.   There is ample seating, which is super nice! I'm bummed I don't live in the area, because I would be back on the regular!!

My cousin was raving to me about Taco y Taco and when I finally got to try it, it totally lived up to the hype!   The place is huge. So much seating! Very clean & modern feel.   You get in line for tacos based on what kind of meat you want. They have everything! Al pastor, carnitas, pollo, barbacoa, carne asada, and more (even tongue if that's your thing!). Street style tacos with everything - onions, cilantro, and salsa are where it's at! Although you can get burritos, tostadas, too.   I went for carnitas, my favorite, and they did not disappoint! Juicy, crispy on the outside, and packed full of flavor.   And let's have a moment of silence for the Mexican street style corn. ............. Get it, squeeze with fresh lime, stuff yo face, be happy.   Salsa bar, thick crispy chips, cheap (2 tacos and corn for under $10!), and you can find me at Taco y Taco every time I'm in Vegas.

I first came to SkinnyFats almost exactly a year ago (their other location) and loved it! Loved the menu and concept and have been hoping I'd get to go again on a future Las Vegas trip.   So when my friends suggested it for dinner, I was stoked. I was glad to come to a second location, to see how it compared. I'm 100% still in. Come to Southern California!!   This time, I got the Caprizza - flat bread pizza with tomatoes, red onion, basil, mozzarella, and grilled chicken, drizzled with a balsamic glaze. It was amazing! Crust was the perfect blend of crispy but not overdone and slightly chewy inside. The ratio of toppings was perfect and it looked so pretty on the plate.   Hoping it isn't another year before I get to go to SkinnyFats again!

I love trying bakeries and cupcake shops when I visit different places.   A Bakeshop was so cute inside (I loved all the different sizes and shapes of cake stands!) and the girl working was really nice and friendly!   I came in later in the afternoon, so maybe it is better in the morning, but their selection wasn't huge. Their website boasted a much longer list of desserts and bake goods than were displayed in the cases.   Most of what we got we liked. Cupcakes were moist and the flavor was good. I loved the coconut one! My husband got an éclair and liked it, but it was filled too much, as when he bit into it, a lot of the filling squished out so he didn't get to eat much of it. We also tried the unfrosted sugar cookie (good) and the 7-layer bar, which had a different crust than others I've tried (cake vs. graham cracker) and I didn't love it as much.
