How many times have I passed this place since I have lived in the valley? About a million? I always said, one day I am going there. Well today I did, and I am so glad!!! Girls impromtu lunch today, so glad I was feeling pasta!! We walked in and were greeted by a fantastic gentelman with a very New York accent. Awesome! As soon as we sat down we knew that this was one cool place. We had a group of servers taking care of us, no pretense here! Loved the ambiance! The food, was oh so fantastic! Can't wait to go and try other dishes. This place is great as a first date night. Like I said not a lot of pretense, so some of that pressure is gone;)  Who care if the menus are not laminated, the food made up for that. So going back!!

The absolute rudest employees! I will think twice about coming here again!! We have been treated with such disregard two times in a row. I think I'm done!

Great sandwich place! I always get delivery, & they are fast and accurate with our orders. They usually get to us within 10 mins of ordering. They are my go to lunch!  The tombstone is my favorite, no sprouts;)

what a great place! I had a staff meeting here this morning and it was perfect. Great selection of drinks, and pastries. The barista recommended the jasmin tea, (my friend asked for a tea recommendation) I had one as well and it was AMAZING! The only thing is there was no honey at the bar;( I will be going here more often!! this place is great for very small groups (we had 8). Take your "Starbucks" meeting here first!
