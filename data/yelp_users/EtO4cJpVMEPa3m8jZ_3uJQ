This store is fabulous, I bought my wedding dress there today. They were extremely friendly, the store is clean, and has great lighting, the consultants are helpful and did not make me feel overwhelmed. I ended up buying the first dress I tried on even thought I went to three other stores and tried on about 30 gowns. The first dress Brides by Demetrios put me in was my dress!!!! I LOVE it. Stephanie helped me and she is the best!! So personable and very caring, I felt like a true bride there!  I highly recommend it.

I went to this office about 7 times in 2015, I decided to change doctors due to my previous Dr being too far away. I was referred to this office by a friend and went to see them, the office is very old, rooms and equipment is old but the staff is friendly. They did see me on really short notice twice due to being violently ill. One time I had to wait an hour and a half the other time they took me right back. I typically have to wait at least 20 min after my scheduled appointment time until they take me back. The upside of this clinic is that they have a medical dispensary on sight so if you dont like to go to Walgreens, its fast and easy to get meds.   My experience: my first visit I only saw a PA, and she was nice but was very holistic and wanted me to try holistic approaches to my issues. I dont mind trying things but when I have a UTI I would like medication for it. I then scheduled my yearly physical and asked to see a doctor at that time. I was scheduled with a doctor who was very friendly and very nice, that Dr has since left the practice, which also bothers me. I went in for my physical and had a mold on my back that was bothering me but wanted a doctor to look at it to see if there way cause for concern. The doctor looked at the mole, said its nothing but I can remove it for you if you would like, I was slightly taken back, but thought well it does bother me so why not. The doctor said it will be a good experience for her new medical assistant. They removed the mole, it was quick and painless. The issue came when I got a bill for 260 for the removal and I called to see why my insurance didn't cover it, apparently insurance doesn't cover "cosmetic procedures" and this was considered one. I was frustrated with the doctor and office for not at least warning me that their might be a charge. I started making payments and then in February 2016 went into the office for another sick visit, paid my copy and a payment on my bill, I asked for an updated balance and they printed me out a 0 balance receipt. I asked if this was the total on my account and they said yes. I assumed that I paid off my balance and was thrilled to not owe money. April 2016 I got a notice in the mail that they sent $71 to collections in may, I called and said I thought I had a 0 balance and why did I get this notice, they said nope you had a 71$ balance and you didnt pay anything. There is nothing I can do and now I have to pay 91 for collection fees. What frustrates me is that the billing office they use is a separate company and never contacted me before they sent me to collections.   If you decide to use this office, be okay with a holistic approach to medicine. Know your insurance and if you ever get a balance call the billing company not the office to get your balance and make sure you get it paid off before they send you to collections.

I absolutely LOVE this place, they give personalized one on one attention to every class. If you are at all worried about taking a reformer class this is the place to try. There are only two people and you plus the instructor in each class.  The teacher makes sure you are doing every move correctly. I love Helen, she is great, she knows me my strength and weaknesses and will help me improve. Now because there are only two spots in each class they do book up fast so you need to be on top of booking your classes, but they have a great app for that. LOVE this place referred my mom and now we go together
