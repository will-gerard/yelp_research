It's been a while (almost a year) since I have been here and the remodeling job is fantastic. It's clean, it's sleek and it's amazing...and I'm jealous of the TVs.   The food is hooter fare, so if you like it this place is for you. Personally, I am a huge fan of hooters wings; they just hit the spot. If you don't, well the beer selection is now quite extensive; and after a few beers does food quality really matter? Let's be honest ... at that point you are just trying to slow down the drunk.   All in all, it was a much needed cosmetic update to a great part of downtown. It's a hooters so the waitresses are friendly, the food is good, beer is ice cold and it's worth the time. If you just went to a Dbacks game, you are less than a 10 min walk. Check it out.

Don't waste your time. The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear.

This location is nearly always busy; but the staff works hard to keep the lines moving and getting drinks out on time.   It's clean, good location with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The recent remodel was a much needed improvement.   If you are in a rush in the mornings...either get here early or find a different location. Still, it's a great place to be.

Of the many places to get a beer in Phoenix, this was my favorite.  A simple menu of both beer and food make this a comfortable place to be.  The taps are standard local and imported beers, they don't rotate all that much but that makes it easy to know what you want.   The food menu is always good and goes great with the beer.  I never had anything that I didn't enjoy and that wasn't tasty.  If you are in downtown and want a place to eat and drink, come here.  I will be sure that I find a hotel near this location when I visit again.

This place is an absolute gem in downtown Phoenix. It's slightly hidden off 1st, but well worth a visit.   The selection of rums is fantastic. Definitely try some of the flights...you will not be disappointed.

We love coming here. The pizza is always delicious and ready on time.  The location is very convenient to us.  Don't try ordering online though, the website is a mess.

The gym is nice and clean, everything looks new but its not worth the price.  I've been a member at several golds gyms and this is by far the smallest and most limited I've been to yet; and the most expensive, i am already canceling my membership.  There is a serious lack of space or options when it comes to free weights.  Most of the plates end up stacked on the sides of machines, so you need to work around others to get the weights off.  Why not just a simple plate tree?  There is good area for doing squats or deadlifts.  Few if any leg machines.  Most of the floor is filled with all sorts of cardio and nautilus styles machines.  The trainers like to occupy benchs when their trainee is on a different machine.  Bottomline: if you are looking for a place to be seen, go here.  If you want to workout, find some where else.

My wife and I love coming here, especially for their happy hour.  Their appetizers are hard to beat.  The cheese/bread/jam combinations are delicious; and the pretzel fondue is addicting.  The main menu is just as delicious, and has a great variety.  We've yet to find something we don't like.  The service is quite good as well, some waiters can be a bit spacey, but for the most part they are good and quick.  My only complaint is that they close far too early, even on the weekends.

Rather disappointed. Not by the beer selection...that is fantastic. But the service? Well now that was lacking. We sat down at one of the several open tables and it took about 10 minutes for the first waitress to tell us she'd be right back. About another 10 minutes pass and a second waitress brings is coasters. Eventually the first waitress came back and we finally ordered drinks; and that's where we stopped. Because at the pace of service here, we wouldn't get any food till next.   Maybe we'll try this again...but sheesh.

This is an absolute can't miss in Phoenix. With 31 constantly rotating taps you will find old favorites and new. Beers do repeat on occasion, but there is always something different awaiting you.   If bottles beer is more your style you can ask for that menu and try something completely new. There are also 6 wine taps if that is more your style.   The food is absolutely phenomenal. It's all made in house so it tastes fresh and it is delicious. They have a seasonal menu as well. I really can't say anything bad ... Other than they are closed on Monday.

Fantastic food & drink. Great selection of lunch and dinner foods.   The patio seating and bar are fantastic.

Skip this place. The coffee tastes burned and stale. Service is far too slow for an airport.
