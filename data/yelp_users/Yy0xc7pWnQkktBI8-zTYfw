I've been going to Rumor's Salon for the last few years and have never had a bad experience! Spesifically, I always go to Amanda B. who is not only professional but extremely personalable. She makes me feel super comfortable and doesn't make me feel silly when I try to explain what I want out of a cut or color but don't know stylist-speak. She pays close attention to detail and listens to what I want. She's even cut my kiddo's hair beautifully which is always a challenge with young, impatient child!  Even when I'm not sure what I want, I trust Amanda and her vision and she ALWAYS delivers! I highly recommend her to anyone wanting to check out Rumors. You won't be dissapointed!

Been there twice for lunch with friends. Ordered the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich with Rosemary French Fries both times. Delicious!!! Fun little place in downtown but more expensive than I usually spend on lunch. Service is ok. Interested in checking it out at night for dinner or cocktails. Will definitely go back but there's other places in downtown I'd like to check out and maybe I can hold my breath for a Groupon???

I, like many others, have had nothing but positive experiences in the last three moves I have used them. When calling the office to set things up the staff was friendly and helpful. The prices were very competitive, if not less expensive then other services out there. More importantly, the men were very courteous, professional, quick and very hard workers in general. As a single woman, I never once felt uncomfortable or felt like I was being taken advantage of. I highly recommend Camelback Moving. Don't forget to tip the guys!

I heart Postinos! Yes, the bruschetta is A-mazing! In particular, the brie & apples with fig spread and ricotta with dates & pistachios. The wine is delicious too. I really like this location better than the Arcadia one too. The staff is friendlier and the people are much more chill and not pretentious. Love the mood lighting too! It's great for both a night out with girlfriends and date night with your honey. Have yet to check out the Monday/Tuesday $20 deal, hope to do that in the near future because I will be back for sure!

What keeps me coming back is the stellar service, the delicious green tea and yummy 'Hot Juan Black Bean Burger' that automatically comes with avocado (YIPPEE!). My only complaint is that with as busy as they are it's hard to find a spot to park or if you want to bring your laptop and work the tables are typically full. None the less, I always leave this place with a smile.

Gem of the Ahwatukee/Chandler area! Loved it so much the first time, I went a second time that same week! First visit I had decided to try the CHILAQUILES VERDES which had layers of corn tortillas with mesquite cooked chicken, Oaxaca cheese, spicy green salsa (not too spicy for a wimp like me) & 2 sunny-side up eggs (which I requested scrambled). IT WAS HEAVEN WITH EACH BITE! My date had and loved the PULLED PORK SANDWICH which had the special recipe braised pork, slow cooked on our mesquite fired rotisserie, served on toasted telera bread and topped with their homemade, spicy cole slaw. UN-REAL! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It was so yummy, from the taste or two I was given.   Second time we went was for breakfast. I had the "El Gallo" Torta with scrambled Eggs, chorizo, tomato & avocado and  mayo served on La Sonorense Telera bread. The chorizo was just spicy enough which I liked. The only thing that would have made the meal perfect was if the torta bread had been toasted (minor, I know). I also ordered a side of hashbrows which were seasoned to perfection and nice and crispy.  A new favorite place for sure! Can't wait to go back and order the pulled pork sandwich for myself!

Checked this place out for the first time a few weeks back on and I love it! My bf is a regular and suggested we go on a Sunday because of the live music and happy hour specials. Loved the look, loved the laidback feel, the live music was beautiful and chill and I loved the covers she played! Had some a slab of bruschetta, which you can never go wrong on with a cold drink! Got the following: * Roasted Peppers, Goat Cheese, Garlic, Tomato Jam  * Apples, Brie, Fig Jam, Honey and Agave Nectar  * Prosciutto, Figs, Mascarpone Cheese, Pepper Jam  Yum and yum. Another place I can't wait to go back to, especially when the whether cools down and I can hang out on the patio!

Definitely my preferred quick Mexican food place! Obsessed! I love this place! The shredded beef burrito is filling and delicious! The fresh salsa is amazing! The only bad thing is they aren't open on Sundays and that's usually when I want it!! :)

Def has become my fav froyo spot. The owners are super nice, the staff is helpful without being annoying, the place is super clean and most importantly the selection is awesome! I love the tart with almonds, berries and coconut! YUM! Hot temps are around the corner, but at least I've found a great place to cool down!

When trying to determine where to go in the Arrowhead area that is fun and not chain the options are limited (I guess I'm spoiled with downtown and Arcadia local options). One friend suggested Betty's. I have purposely not visited because I don't eat mushrooms and I hear that's what this place is all about. Here's my thoughts:  No wait mid-week night and the staff was prompt and nice-enough. Happily surprised to hear you could still take advantage of the mushroom 'bar' and get toasted bread instead of 'shrooms. I love me some gluten bread!   Lots of exciting selections on the sandwich menu that looked tastier so I choose the roast beef upon the recommendation of the server. I hate to say it but it was dry and annoyed I paid a hard-earned $14 for it. However, shared a great bottle of wine with friends and atmosphere was enjoyable for a few girls laughing and reminiscing.   Next time someone wants to grab food and drinks in the NW side of town I am not convinced I would go back and would rather opt to make the drive downtown to somewhere I know and love.
