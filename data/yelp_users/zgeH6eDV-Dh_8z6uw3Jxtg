HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service.  We came to have our Lexas RX washed and the carpets shampooed cause we are selling the car.  Dropped it off and they said come back in hour.  We went to lunch and came back an hour later.  There was still several spots of bird poop and they had shampooed the carpets but didn't vacuum. So they said they would run it through again and vacuum the seats.  We said we would be back and went and ran some errands.  Another hour later we come back and there is still bird poop and the vacuuming just seemed to scatter the dirt around.  The carpets are still dirty.  We aren't difficult and trying to get something for nothing.  They agreed to shampoo and was the car for $50.  I expect the job to be done.  So we pointed out the bitd poop that we pointed out before.  They took it away again and shampooed the mats and vacuumed....again.  To come back and miss the front mats....it was a 4 hour process how to tell 5hem how to do their job.  Admittedly they did it, but I would be fired if I had to be told how to do my job like this.

This used to be a franchise shop...and it was great.  I would have given it 5 stars.  Since the owner sold the franchise back to corporate it is still really good...service is just not as great.  The food is still top notch.  The Capastomi sandwich is sooooo good.  Grilled pastrami on top of cole slaw...yes cole slaw with Russian dressing.  I'm not a big fan of cole slaw, but it absolutely makes this sandwich.  My family call the Capastromi sandwich "Unicorn Meat"...it's so good it's mythical.  Be sure to try out the "Dragon Meat" sandwiches at Phoenix Cheesesteak Co.  :)

I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was just "Meh."  I always judge a coffee shop by their *OMG* coffee (drip coffee that is).  It's impossible to judge good coffee with all the syrups and sweets people put in them.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good dessert coffee once in awhile.  On this occasion I stopped in during the mid morning and their coffee was really bland.  It isn't as bad as freeze dried...but it's not any better then I can get from Circle K.

I by almost all my coffee for my drip machine (yes, my automatic drip coffee maker...get over yourself) from here.  Mainly because they are close by  They roast their own coffee and have some excellent roasts.  My favorite so far is the Peruvian.  But there are still so many to try.  Their roasts are constantly changing, which can be annoying when you find something you like and next time it's gone.    The people here are super friendly (both employees and guests).  The crowd is mostly 20-somethings (PVCC is right across the street), but I've never felt "the old man" when I'm in here.  They are not as specialized as Cartel Coffee, but offer great coffee and comfortable environment and a very pleasant experience.

Though their drip coffee is good, they don't offer refills even at a discount.  No drip coffee is worth $2.50 PER CUP!  Their service was "meh".  It took nearly 10 minutes to get a cup of drip coffee.  If they had to have brewed it, I could understand.  But he just pulled it out of one of those insulated pumps.  I also tried their cranberry scone which was good.  Not overly sweet as so many shops have a tendency to do, nor so dry it is like eating dust.  Overall a nice pleasant atmosphere.  But their overpriced coffee will keep me from coming back.

So when you think of lunch in a gas station, what comes to my mind are shriveled up hot dogs on rollers, thin, dry hamburgers under a heat lamp or maybe a microwave burrito, not at Tom's Thumb Gas Station.  Campfire Bistro is located inside the gas station and this place has real smoked BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was very, very good.  It wasn't the best BBQ I have ever eaten, but it was extremely good.  It was very flavorful and not dry at all.  They had a wide assortment of sauces available from North Carolina vinegars to Texas sweets to KC mustards.  I tried a Chipotle sauce...very good, some bite without a lot heat.

The Coronado is awesome.  Caramelized onions, Red Bell Peppers, Provolone Cheese and homemade Horseradish cole slaw.  Topped with fried onion ring and roasted chile mayo.  It is cheesesteak goodness.  The place looks sketchy from the outside, but inside is VERY clean and nice.  Staff are very friendly and attentive.  I have been here a dozen times since I started the draft of this review, and they are still worth every bit of the 5 stars.  The rib-eye meat they use is so good and makes for great sandwiches, my family has taken to calling it 'dragon meat'...(we already call the Capistromi @ Capriotti's 'unicorn meat')...they are so good it's mythical.
