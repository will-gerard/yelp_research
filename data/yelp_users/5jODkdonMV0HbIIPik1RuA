I called pretty much all the ACE Hardware stores and Home Depots in the valley and nobody had what I needed! I finally called this place and they had it! They had the beloved gaffers tape! Excellent! They put it on hold for me, I went in, picked it up, and went my way! Excellent service!

Pizza Heaven has been on my list to try for quite some time now & I honestly haven't gone because I initially thought it would be more on the comfort food side rather than healthy quality food, boy was I wrong.  Last Saturday night after I over worked out myself, my body just needed some... CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach.   Oh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.  I talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.  I cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food.

Very nice staff! It's always packed in here & I'm not surprised! Quality food! Lots of options! I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!!

One star for now. Why? Because, they just can't seem to get my drink right. I don't understand what's so hard about getting me a cup of nut mylk with ONE shot of espresso on top, layered. The excuses, "our machine makes two espressos at a time." That's nice dear, here is an idea, just put half of that? I mean it's incredible that the last EIGHT time I went there, they can't seem to get it right. Yesterday, she almost got it right, she put just half the espresso shot but then she mixed the whole drink and I told her that's not what I wanted and I wanted it layered and she said, "what do you mean?" If that was a question, why didn't you ask me when I ordered. Didn't even offer to remake it and she just walked away. I'm sorry but for $6 a drink, get it right LGO.

This While Foods deserve 5 stars b/c EVERY Whole Foods deserves 5 stars.   Why would I give anything less? Whole Foods has selections for special dietary needs such as vegetarian, vegan, GF, paleo, nut-free, soy-free, no transfat, etc. The list just goes on. They are also big on local and organic and educating the public about genetically modified organisms and the negative effects it has on our health and environment.  Whole Foods always seems to excel in customer service, this location can use a little help in some part of their store, but other than that, it's great. It doesn't compare to Whole Foods on Mayo or Camelback, but it's still a great go to grocery store for people in the Paradise Valley and Phoenix area.

I purchased a 2014 Outlander Sport at this dealership this Saturday night! It only had 4 miles! I had talked to sales manager Nissa over the phone prior to coming in. I informed her what I wanted and what color I wanted. She quoted me a price over the phone & I was hesitant but I decided to make the drive. I was also very persistent to put the 5th mile on it! Well, when I got there, the price she quoted me... was... the... SAME!!! It was the price I got. No hustle, no BS! And, I got to put the 5th mile when I test drove it! Antonio was the salesman & everything was very smooth. He was very nice and I am comfortable referring to him, and Nissa, of course! I'm very satisfied. Gary in finance was very patient because it was my first time buying a car, I needed to make sure I understood everything 100% ~ I told him I would keep him there till midnight if I had to! LOL! I went to another Mitsubishi dealership earlier that Saturday & I walked a away for a reason. Great job to the team at Big Two! Nissa, I see big success for your dealership because you work with high values and integrity.

I have nothing bad to say about this place. My mom and I went to purchase a wedding gift for a friend and we were very pleased with the customer service, Jared was our first stop then we browsed around Arrowhead Mall and, of course, ended up where we started. A review below stated that they didn't like that they were selling teddy bears? I totally love that.They sell them for $12.99 and proceeds go to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We, of course, purchased one. It's for a great cause. Not everyone is blessed with great health so why not contribute when you can, right? I will be back soon b/c I saw this white gold/yellow gold diamond cat necklace that I am ABSOLUTELY in love with!

I've never heard of this restaurant and when I did, I had no interest of going. BUT, I was in the Arrowhead area for a beauty appointment and my friends wanted to get together for a dinner. Since I was already in the area, and since it was within driving distance for my friends, they suggested we meet at Abuelo's.  I of course assumed there would be absolutely nothing here for me. I don't eat meat, egg, or dairy and I avoid canola/vegetable oil, non-organic corn, etc. Some may say I'm a "picky eater" but I say I'm an educated one. I had stopped at Sprouts prior to coming and stocked up on snacks because what's this restaurant going to have for me? NOTHING!  I came early to ask the staff if they had a vegan menu, the hostess asked her regional manager and he said that they do not but that they can accommodate. "Yeah, sure, sure," I thought, "he probably doesn't even know why vegan means" I also thought to myself. He stated that he will come to my table and go over the menu options once I am seated. I somewhat was feeling better but not really because restaurants always say that, but are completely uneducated what vegan means. I didn't get my hopes up.  Once I was seated he really did come to my table and talk to me about what my options were. I was shocked. He even went over what the ingredients were in the guacamole, the rice, the beans, etc. WHAT!!! Can it be! Then he said that he will check the ingredients in the corn tortillas or I can have my veggies in a lettuce wrap! WHAT!!! Then I asked him about EVOO instead of vegetable/canola oil and he said they absolutely can accommodate! WHAT!!! Can you say how incredibly shocked I was that 1. He was educated. 2. He ACTUALLY cared! 3. He didn't make up stuff, like on the tortillas, he said he would check the ingredients instead of, "I think they are vegan." Which is what I usually hear.  All my friends were really impressed by this. My server informed me that the regional manager was actually making my meal himself. I'm still so shocked I can't believe it. Our server informed me that the regional managers name was George (I believe is what he said), I tried to look for him after to personally thank him again, but was unable to find him.  5 stars strictly goes to Abuelo's regional manager, George! Thank you for being educated but also for actually caring! Whoever is his manager NEEDS to recognize him! His style of managing and how caring he was is so rare to find in the industry.

I found this place by accident while I was visiting Starbucks and I am so happy that I did! I went in for the first time last week and was back this week. I only tried their hummus with extra pita and tomatoes! Yum! Their pita bread alone is so delicious and of course the hummus too! I cannot wait to take my boyfriend here because I know he will love it as well! I just keep thinking about the hummus and pita! OMG! Soooo tasty! *MOUTH DROOLS* The lady up front is very nice too and I liked that they had tables outside! I cannot wait to go back!!

I forgot to write an updated review from my last visit several months ago. I used to love this place but like the other review stated, the quality has really gone down and so had the service. I'm not impressed anymore.There is absolutely not a single reason why this restaurant excels it's competition. Decrease in quality, decrease in customer service, no thanks.

I came to a wedding here & I cannot imagine why anyone would choose this place. Halfway through the wedding they had made the lower floor a dance floor & because of that everyone that was sitting at the table on the lower floor had to move. But, where? There weren't any tables available. So, the guests had to sit in the bleachers. It was super awkward. Shortly after that move was made, dessert was served but the guests who were sitting on the bleachers couldn't help themselves because eating & drinking was not allowed in that part of the venue. The outside of the venue was nice but the inside was awful. Prior to them putting the chairs & tables away, I noticed just how ancient the fold in chairs were. I mean come on, time to upgrade ASU. Oh, & the floors where the bleachers were made me sick. They were so dirty. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a venue to get married.

I've been a member since I was in my teens. I've always had positive experiences. The monthly fee is ridiculous because the services that the monthly fee pays for are downright awful. ID Protect Me 24/7 is one of them and it is a horrible company. When there was a mistake on my credit score and report, I called them and they refused to help me, when I asked to speak to a manager I was told no. When I called the next day, the manager was so rude to me and didn't want to budge on helping me file a dispute. It's disturbing that Arizona Federal uses companies like this and worse of all I have to pay a monthly fee to utilize them.  Moving on, recently I visited Arizona Federal to pull up my new credit score after I got my whole mess was fixed, which I had to contact each individual credit bureau to help fix the mistake. The girl at Arizona Federal who initially was helping me was nice. She wanted a second opinion so she called another girl to help answer my questions. I asked for all three of my credit scores and she questioned why I wanted all three. She asked, "are you buying a house or something?" WHAT? That was weird. No, I'm not buying a house, I'm intelligent enough to want to know my score so I don't have any surprises should I make any moves in the future to buy a house, genius. Anyways, they couldn't help me. They stated that because I pulled up my credit score recently through ID Protect Me 24/7, that they are unable to pull up my new score. I needed to know my new score because of the mistake/mess that occurred on my report and needed to know if it was back to normal, it had dropped by over 100 points.  I find it odd that the services I am paying for every month to use at home, are the same, AND ONLY services that the bank uses. ID Protect Me 24/7 ONLY pulls up from ONE credit bureau, not all three, so through AZ Federal, you never will really know your true credit score. How disappointing. It was a waste of a trip, and a waste of my time. The girl who initially helped me seemed somewhat professional, the other, not so much. My monthly fee is totally useless, if it wasn't, I wouldn't complain. My boyfriend is with another credit union and he doesn't pay a monthly fee. He just purchased a vehicle through them and the service was exceptional. Maybe it's time for me to make some moves as well.

Had to drop another star because of how ridiculous this bank is. I currently still bank with AZ Federal because I am in the process of looking for another bank to switch to and doing my research. Last few times I came, they made it seem as they do me a favor for the services I need that I should NOT be paying for. "There is a $2.00 charge for wanting your statement printed out, but I will wave it for you." Uhh... Okay... Thanks! BUT, I shouldn't be paying for that anyways. Another time I came to get a money order, there was a fee and there was also a fee to get a notify. Which I appreciate them "waving" for me but it's like I shouldn't be getting charged for that anyways. What really ticks me off is that I haven't been able to log into my account via their app on my iPhone because it CONSTANTLY asks me to to have a code texted to me for me to verify and THEN log in. It always says, "one time verification" but it does that EACH TIME I LOG IN! Seriously? I recently refinanced the family house through a different back in which my experience was awesome. As I was in the process of refinancing, AZ Federal called me to let me know they offer that service too. Um... NO THANKS!!!

Been going here for some time, I love it. I love the hours, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere. Recently I had a bad experience, but it turned good. I had ordered a salad that was originally advertised with ham and some cheese dressing, me being a vegan, it didn't work for me. So, I ordered the salad with olive oil and vinegar dressing minus the ham, the server told me it would be made vegan for me. After half way through my salad, I found a piece of ham on the bottom. Oh man I was bummed. But, I didn't make a big deal because you know what, mistakes happen and it's nobody's fault. The server asked me if I wanted a togo box but I said no because the piece of ham turned me off from wanting to take it home. He was so apologetic but I told him I understood because us humans are allowed to make mistakes, right? Accidents happen and thats okay. I got my card out to pay and he brought me the bill... for ZERO dollars. WOW!! I couldn't believe it. Usually it's always the people that bit_h that get free stuff and I thought it was so awesome they took care of my salad for me. I am beyond impressed, such wonderful customer service.

Came here for the first time today inbetween visiting my patients for work, just needed some hot tea. I noticed on the menu that there was a Hummus Bagel. I asked the guy if it was vegan friendly and he said that it was. I came back later in the day for lunch, which was out of my way mind you, to order the "vegan friendly" bagel and the guy told me that he is "pretty sure" the bagels contain eggs. I told him that I was told the exact opposite this morning. He said, "yeah I don't know we get it from the bakery." Okay, thanks! Seriously! Why are two different employees giving me two different answers. Get it together, food allergies are not something to be taken lightly. I will not return.

I'm a regular at LGO Grocery and tonight was my first night dining in and ordering a pizza. It was BUSY but the service was excellent. My waiter informed me that their pesto is vegan, made w/o parmesan cheese! I asked him if he was sure, LOL, and he said he absolutely is because they use the pesto as a base for many of their vegan pizzas. That was so awesome. Of course I ordered it and I was so impressed. It was delicious. My mom had a mushroom pizza and she was very satisfied as well. I can't wait to be back and I am so glad I tried it.

Love this place! I can't believe the bad reviews! Spend my weekend in Vegas and was here both nights for the dancing. I first went to LAX and it was so crowded, nowhere to dance! What's the point? So, we came here and had a BLAST!!! Next night we went to HAZE at Aria, and it was SUCH a disappointment, so we came here, again. It was so much fun! Staff is friendly, people are friendly. We didn't have the food so I can't comment on that, we just came to dance and it was SO MUCH FUN! I was probably the only non-Latin in there but nobody cared! It was a BLAST!!!  P.S. - they had water bottles for a dollar... A DOLLAR!!! This is unheard of at the strip. I was a happy camper since I don't drink!

I just had the BEST donut from Urban Cookies. It was so delicious I just can't get over it! I took a but and it just melted in my mouth, so good. The customer service was good as well. What impressed me the most was that a little boy came in (maybe 14 or 15 years old) to buy a bottle of water (it was much needed, today was 110 degrees). The guy behind the counter asked him if he was walking or taking the bus, and the kid said he was taking the bus. The guy gave him a free bottle of water. He said it was for anyone who walks or takes the bus. I love it, support being green. It was wonderful. I still can't get over that donut. It says on the bag they use local and organic ingredients, which I love. I try to avoid GMO as much as I can.

I don't know why there are such negative reviews. This Enterprise was actually one of the best ones I've been to. I dropped my rental car off that I picked up from another Enterprise a week and a half ago. I was in and out within 5 minutes. The gentleman who helped me was extremely nice. Easy breezy.

Sadly, I have to part my ways w/ Lemy Nail Salon. I really have everything wonderful to say about the girls who work there, Jenni and Tracie, BUT, I will not put up w/ scheduling appointments, coming 5-10 minutes early, and then not be seen for 40 minutes after my scheduled appointment. I've put up w/ it more than a few times before and this is officially the end of my time and loyalty being disrespected at Lemys.

Oh my! I am SHOCKED at the negative reviews! I have known Dr. Nava and his amazing staff for quite some time and see them on occasion. I think the staff there are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. They are very genuine and kind and I have never had a negative experience. I highly recommend Dr. Nava and PA Angie. They are both, along w/ the medical assistants and office manager, are very kind, caring, and compassionate. The central location is also very accessible and parking is a breeze.

What a terrible place, I don't know if this was an off night for them or if this is a normal night but my boyfriend and I had the absolute worst service.  We sat outside and the waitress was pretty prompt at getting us our drinks, but she must have gotten stuck w/ other customers inside because it took about 15 minutes for us to order our food. Once we did tho, the food came out quick. We ordered a side of lemon wedges, I asked the waitress, got nothing, the boys that come in and check on us I asked as well, nothing. Finally, we get a couple of lemon slices, very tiny thin slices lemon. I asked for wedged and they took it back to replace it and I kid you not, 25 minutes pass by, nothing. FINALLY, lemon wedges arrived and we can eat. When they arrived I had asked the guy for another order of lemon wedges, 20 minutes pass and nothing. Then finally we get them.  *SIGH*  Our drinks never refilled, no idea where the waitress is, I was ready to go home. We ask for the check and waited... waited some more... and, waited...  I went to wait in our car and my boyfriend went inside to pay, $41!!!! For his Alaskan Roll, Shrimp Sushi, and my Avocado Roll and Vegetable Roll. My rolls were never on the menu, but they were $9 EACH!!! WTF!!! My rolls w/ avocado and carrots were more expensive than the specialty rolls??  I went back for an itemized receipt, they don't have one. The guy wrote everything out and I was overcharge by $3.50. I realized that after we drove away and wasn't going to turn around for such a small amount.  AWFUL PLACE NEVER RETURNING!!!

This is my FAVORITE Whole Foods and my FAVORITE grocery store! I love coming here! I love that the vegan products are labeled vegan! I love that they can make a vegan cake for my birthday! I come here and can spend like an hour plus there! My favorite is the Yasmin hummus (MUST TRY), I also love the vegan cookie dough, DELICIOUS! Oh and their fresh made salsa, yummyyyyy!!! This place is a bit far from me but it's worth a trip!

I just don't understand how this place would get anything less of 5 stars. After reading some of the reviews on here I am so disappointed at what the main complaints are. I guess some people are used to going to an over the top sushi place in Scottsdale where you get your ass wiped for you. I mean seriously get over yourselves people. Kabuki is THE BEST! I love the veggie roll there, the avocado, and pretty much anything vegetable. My boyfriends favorite is the Alaskan, Dynamite, Philadelphia, and sushi tempura. I have tried other sushi places (Stingray, Sushi Brokers, etc) and I can honestly say that nothing compares. Friday night and Saturday nights, yes it gets busy, yes, you may have to wait, get over it. If it's busy and it takes a few minutes for your alcoholic drink to arrive, so be it, it's JUST a drink. I love coming to Kabuki, I love that they offer the Red Mask Club so you can get coupons in the mail, and over all I love the Reverse Happy Hour. Buy one get one for a dollar? Yes please :)

I'm am VERY happy w/ Sage Kitchen! Let's go back in time, when this restaurant used to be my FAVORITE!! My mom and I had lunch here weekly. We had a few awkward moments years ago but that never stopped us from coming back! The food was delish and it was definitely our favorite!  A few months ago, everything changed! The wraps, the soups, and everything in between. It was horrible and disappointing so we stopped coming. Then recently, I was informed that they went back to their old and original menu! YES!!! I went back to test it out and it was true! My mom and I are back to our lunch dates here and we are both pleased!  We were shocked at how much the decor has changed. It's very GREEN! But, the original menu is back so I am not complaining! I'm happy to be back and I hope for no more menu changes!

I'm so mad. I pride myself on being a vegan and being committed to a plant based diet for so many years and every now and then after a day of shopping my mom and I would go in for a late lunch. The staff always reassured me that the portobello burger was vegan. My mom and I went tonight and I just happened to browse on the Pita Jungle website on my phone and looks like the portobello burger is NOT vegan b/c the bun has dairy. When our waitress approached us to take our order (who BTW was not friendly) I asked her if the portobello burger was vegan and she said that is was, when I told her on their website that it said it wasn't she went to check the ingredients on the bun and comes back to tell me that it's not vegan. The staff obviously needs education!!!! I cannot believe I have been eating something that is against my beliefs all this time due to lack of knowledge of the Pita Jungle staff. The waitress then tells me that I can always substitute my bun for a 12 grain bread BUT according to their website the 12 grain bread isn't vegan either. Such a shame! I am so, so, SO disappointed!!!!!!

I am giving Grimaldi's Pizzeria a 4 just because I had one not-so-tiny bad experience there, otherwise, it would get 5 stars from me. First time trying it was over a year ago and it was delicious. I would come back all the time and referred quite a few customers there. I still go about once a week, or every other week. My first bad experience was several weeks ago when I ordered a sliced tomato and mushroom pizza. My boyfriend and I were enjoying and were half way finished when I took a bite in something very chewy. It was pepperoni. Now this wouldn't be a big deal at all if eating meat was not against my beliefs. It really surprised me because I had been there so many times and this one time, out of all the pizzas, and all the people who do eat meat, this happens to me. Weird. I complained and the manager came out to apologize and that was it. She just apologized and stood there. It took her a few minutes to offer not charging us for the pizza. It was very awkward. Other that that one bad experience, I still come back. Always. The quality of the pizza sauce and the cheese is GREAT and everything else is great as well. This pizza is made in the brick over so it will not be your usual pizza you order from Dominos or Pizza Hut. If you are used to thick, greasy, nasty, low quality pizza, this place is NOT for you.

UGH - what has happened to this place. I came tonight for dinner and I started off w/ my usual, Kale Aid, and I thought, "something is off." It seemed VERY watered down, but then I thought maybe it's me, so, I didn't say anything.   I ordered a Mediterranean Quinoa salad, minus the feta and the staff assured me the dressing was vegan. The salad came and quinoa was nowhere to be found, I looked and looked, and found a single quinoa grain, like ONE quinoa grain. WHAT! Okay, so, I got to taste it, AWFUL! The dressing was disgusting! It was as if they went to a Wal Mart down and got a bottle of the cheapest Italian dressing and smothered it all over the salad. The salad tasted so cheap, I totally lost my appetite.  I sent my salad back, wasn't in the mood to eat anything else, it was THAT bad! I mean, come one, for $13, part of your salads name is "quinoa" and there is one single grain of quinoa w/ cheap dressing. The quality of this place has really gone downhill and I after this experience I can confirm that I was right about my Kale Aid and wasn't over thinking it.  With so many new options outside of the Fox Concept rising in the Biltmore and Arcadia area, there is absolutely nothing driving me to go back to True Foods.

I cannot believe all these negative reviews.   First I'd like to start with the prices. Don't get me wrong, I love a good deal, BUT, if you are going to complain about how jobs in America are moving to China and India and not shop at AA because of their prices, then you are a hypocrite. AA supports US jobs and their factory is here in the states where they actually care about ethics and their employees. And, they have sales too, I have been in this store more than a few times and seen 30% - 50% off sale signs. And, on their website you can shop the sale section and save up to 75% if not more.  To the clothes - I understand some people may be weirded out and flash back into the 80's when they see the clothes here, as I have read from the reviews on here, BUT, these clothes are actually very stylish and a simple top with a simple pencil skirt  from AA and with some accessories you have a fab outfit. If you are looking for something not so simple try a white strapless romper with their petticoat skirt, add some accessories, and your done.   The sizes - I am size 4-6 with curves, and the clothes from here fit me fine. I can understand the frustration if you are a little bigger and have had a hard time fitting into the clothes from AA. But, the good thing is that AA is now coming with XL sizes in some of their clothing.   The models - I love the fact that the models are real and barefaced. As someone who has struggled with a skin condition, I always hate walking around the mall only to see photoshopped perfect faces surrounding me. I always feel comfortable when I walk into AA.  This store - I have never had a bad experience. Always a good one. i like the store, the employees have always been nice to me, I have no complains.

I am VERY disappointed at Postino Central. I really loved this place the few times I have tried it, and, was starting to become quite a fan and even introduced a few of my friends who have never bee. Unfortunately, all of this changed this past Saturday night.   I went to have dinner and I ordered my usual vegetarian sandwich w/ no goat cheese. I have a sensitivity to dairy and as of recently, I was informed that I have an allergy after an order mess up in another establishment which actually resulted in a hospitalization. I informed the waiter that I absolutely wanted no cheese/dairy on my sandwich nor my salad.  I got my dinner and it looked clear of cheese. No cheese on my salad, so I assumed no cheese was in my sandwich per my request. I ate half of it and my stomach started aching really bad. It hasn't clicked in of the possibility of dairy. I didn't want to continue eating because something was not right. I even had to excuse myself to go to the ladies room due to how dairy impacts my body. I come back and look closely at my second half of my sandwich, and there it was... CHEESE!  I immediately notified the staff, who didn't seem to give a single crap about it. "Sorry about that." Was all I got. They took my sandwich off of my receipt and I went home ill w/ the same symptoms I had when I previously had dairy due to another establishments mess up. Have to follow up w/ my doctors office this week and go through a whole unnecessary mess due to Postino.  I mean, if you mess up at least show that you care. The staff at Postino Central, didn't give a single rats a_s. It was more of an "oops" or "oh well" attitude. Extremely disrespectful and unacceptable. I will NOT return!!!

5 stars for being opened till 2AM on a Saturday night for us vampires! Woot! Who doesn't love very late night sushi! I wish the avocado rolls weren't $7 but that's okay, they are so delicious and fresh, and I wish the soy sauce wasn't sooooooo salty but that's okay too b/c the food is great, the hours are fantastic and I saw they support other local businesses which I am all for. So, over all 5 stars!

5 stars for having vegan options and supporting local! And, sometimes the wait can be long, which I like because I can relax by the pool. Awesome. Oh oh oh, I love that they don't use lard or put dairy in their guac. 5 starts, 5 stars!!!

This place is 12 miles away from my house. My boyfriend and I make it a point to go once a week. The wraps are AMAZING! And, fresh! And, you don't feel like lard after eating one. Doesn't drain you and/or make you crave a nap. I get the Farmers Market Wrap which is vegetarian and is sooooooooo good. My mouth is watering right now. And, my boyfriend gets the Laguna Tuna. He loves it!

This place is a joke. The food is a joke. The service is a joke. The biggest joke is the security who, in their mind, think they are above all authority. I hear horrible things about this place all the time and I should have never went. I don't understand why there is always a line Friday and Saturday nights. It sucks!

I cannot believe I never wrote a review about LuluLemon, especially b/c I come here, all the time. I lost my LuluLemon virginity in 2014 when I just casually walked in wanting to try their pants. I have been working out in leggings that I purchased from VS & I love them, just not the best to workout in. My first visit there, the girls were so nice, I bought pants & a sports bra, the TaTa Tamer. I loved my new workout clothes but a few weeks later, my sports bra (the clips in the back) came loose. I called LuluLemon & they exchanged it without a problem. They say they stand behind their product & gave me no trouble to exchange it. I went back a few more times & bought more workout clothes, all which I was very pleased with. This past Valentines Day my boyfriend treated me to LuluLemon, and I tried one of their new sports bras. After a couple of weeks of trying it out, it just didn't work well for me as well as the TaTa Tamer, & this was no problem for LuluLemon, I was able to exchange it. I had such positive experiences here! I love this place!

This morning I was craving some tea so I decided to stop in here and treat myself, first timer. I had the peppermint hot tea and I noticed on their menu they had vegan options. I asked the gentlemen in the front and he said they are completely a vegetarian restaurant with a lot of vegan options. He also informed me of their vegan lunch options. I came back and tried the smoked tofu sandwich with nut cheese and my gosh, it was SO delicious!!! I give this restaurant 5 stars, I almost wasn't even going to stop in but I am so glad that I did!

I bought my Givenchy bag here about a month ago! The staff was very nice and were very respectful of the fact that I wanted a vegan handbag, no leather, no fur, etc. Barney's ordered my Givenchy online to be shipped to their store and the staff even reconfirmed that it was in fact vegan-leather that was used along w/ PVC material. I'm very happy w/ my Givenchy and I am very happy w/ the fact that the sales lady showed me other vegan options as well. I had a nice experience as it took me a really long time to make sure that this was the bag for me. And, am happy to say that it very much was.

I am a Starbucks SNOB. I do love to support local coffee shops but I absolutely have been a Starbucks fanatic forever. I gave Lola a try after a late lunch @ Pita Jungle. I was so impressed. I told the barista I was a vegan and she was able to veganise my white chocolate coffee (I think that was the name) by using different ingredients. AWESOME. I then went back a few days later and had the caramel coffee, delish! So good! I no longer have a craving for Starbucks, like at all!

A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!

Love this place! It's so refreshing to see the Humane Society at the Biltmore Fashion Park b/c I see a lot of people w/ their pure bread dogs that they purchased from breeders. The Humane Society being here just means so much to me b/c it's shows how amazing & beautiful shelter dogs are. I come in here to purchase my dogs some treats from their bakery section. My dogs LOVE it & get so excited when I bring it to them. For my cats, I treat them to mouse toys, pink for Mici & blue for Maći. With a buck pet mouse toy, you just can't go wrong. I came here w/ my nieces today & they got to play w/ Fluffy, a soft & beautiful rabbit. The volunteer there was so kind to let them pet Fluffy. Always a wonderful experience.

I pulled up to get a car wash and the guy tells me, "I can get all of this detailed and out the door for $80." For a minute I thought I was at a car dealership. Why is he using the "out the door lingo?" I got it detailed for $40 which wasn't too bad because I have never had it detailed and have had my car for over 5 years now. They did pretty good but I didn't like them trying to screw me over. Which is why they get one star. My boyfriend went there yesterday. The guy tells him he will get his car detailed for 120 dollars... LMAO!!! My boyfriend declined and then they offered to do it for 70. Hahahahaha!!!! What a price difference but he still said no. These salesmen are such crooks and if you go don't fall for the expensive detailing they try to sell you.

I'm have been vegan for many years & am very cautious about GMO's & avoid them at all cost. With that being said, I absolutely love that most everything at Pomegranate Cafe is vegan & organic & bonus stars for the raw options. I went there the first time towards the end of October & I had some kind of a burrito. I ate the whole thing, it was delicious. I then ordered a caramel coconut drink from their coffee menu along with a desert. Everything was delicious. After I was finished m I went to the bathroom to wash my hands & I am not sure what happened but shortly after I came out, I got nauseated. I puked all my lunch which is way odd for me to so b/c I NEVER vomit/puke or anything. Not even when I  sick. Maybe I was so excited I ate too quick & too much? I don't know. Another weird thing that happened was, during our lunch, I asked to keep one of the menus b/c I wanted to continue browsing through (it was my first time there) I was told I couldn't b/c they were short of menus. LOL. Odd. Then a few minutes later she gave me back the menu. Alrighty. Ha!!  My B/F said that we should not come back b/c he was sure it was the food that made me sick but I refused to believe. We went back again a couple of weeks later & I had he raw tacos. They were good. We had a good experience. Except when I ordered my caramel coconut drink from the coffee menu, it didn't taste the same as last time. Like AT ALL. I ended up throwing it away. But, overall, a nice experience.  My 3rd visit just a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the French toast and was very disappointing. There was nothing French toast about this French toast. It was a pastry, like banana bread. Totally didn't even eat it. Had a few bites but that's it. I did order the organic scramble & it was super delicious.  4 stars for now.

I am not a fan. The fruit is awful. It tastes like canned fruit. Not fresh at all. No dairy-free yogurt either! :( The staff is really nice though, I wish i could love it because I love going to WestGate. Mojos is SO MUCH better!!

Love that they have vegan options, love that they are educated about GMO's, food allergies, etc. and, I love their raw burger, well, I used to, I had it tonight and it was hard, like really hard. It used to be DELICIOUS!!! I picked up my food to go and waited quite a bit before anyone even said hello, or took my order. I noticed a couple of customers walk up to the bar to ask for service, one I know wanted more peanut sauce. Before I got my food a mother and son had walked out and they were both shaking their heads. It felt uncomfortable there. I was there a couple of months ago for lunch, had the same uncomfortable feeling but the food was great. And, several months ago I was there with my boyfriend on a Friday night and everything was good, I don't know what's going on. I will give it a little bit before I return, IF I return, I really do applaud the owners of their concept especially on the GMO issue.

I went today for the second time. I love how friendly the employees are! I also love that they carry rice milk! Anywhere else the dairy free options are typically soy.  Must try is the blended chai with rice milk. SO GOOD!

If you like food that reminds you of your 4th grade meal from elementary school then this is the place. I hate to give it one star, I really do, because it seems like a small family business and our waitress was such a sweetheart BUT the food was awful. If you like Greek salads be prepared to mix your own dressing with it. It does not come mixed with the dressing. If you like kalmata olives that you would get on a Greek salad ANYWHERE else be prepared because the olives on this salad are not kalmata. The only thing that makes this salad "Greek" is the feta. Other than that there is nothing special about it. Their little bread on the side took me back to 4th grade elementary school where we got little buns on the side of our plates for lunch. The spaghetti had a little bit of marinara sauce. Wasn't even enough. And, which for being "homemade" had a very 'out-of-the-can' taste. There was absolutely nothing special about this place. Overpriced. I guess if you are there on a hot summer day and your kids are playing in the water and get hungry than they would probably like the pizzas by the slice I saw them offer but for a dinner I highly recommend you go to Gramaldis down the street. But, the people are SUPER nice. I would give this place another try if I saw major improvement and who knows maybe I will since I believe it recently opened up :)

I'm am giving this restaurant 5 stars solely based on team leader Jennifer. I came in today to pick up subs for a lunch I was hosting. It was a little last minute for me BUT they had over 10 orders for me ready in less than 10 minutes.  I asked Jennifer to help me w/ allergy information, no eggs and no dairy. Jennifer took out the boxes for the bread and showed me the ingredient. She went above and beyond and specialized my sub to be completely vegan. She was so nice and patient and I appreciate that she didn't just answer questions based on if she "thought" the bread contained egg or dairy. I appreciate that so much.  I never ate my sandwich, because, there were a lot of chemicals in the dressings and the bread and everything else. I did however open it up and pick out the veggies, so, it was fine. Like I said, this review is based solely on Jennifer for going above and beyond w/ an amazing attitude.   Way to go Jennifer!

I haven't been to Green in a really long time, well over a year if not longer. A few years ago I was a regular & came on a weekly basis but then my lifestyle diet became more strict when I eliminated the "comfort food" that I craved, dropped sugar, & increased my workouts. I decided to go today b/c I've been sick w/ the flu & this is my third week not being active so I guess my body needed that "comfort food" satisfaction. I went to Green and had a salad, & for that comfort food cravings, I had the crab puffs. The salad was good & so were the crab puffs, of course the post meal feeling has me feeling tiered, which I am not used to but the food definitely hit the spot for the time being since I've been having that naughty food craving. Although I don't plan to return for a long time, maybe when that craving hits again, I still want to give Green 5 stars for being vegan, using organic ingredients whenever possible, & my salad seemed like a quality salad, so why not. It's great that Green is able to introduce vegan foods to non-vegans whose mind may not have been open to trying vegan food, that alone deserves 5 stars.

This is obviously the best pizza ever. My choice of pizza is the Marinara (no cheese) with olives. It's BEYOND delicious. This is QUALITY pizza guys! I'm seeing all these reviews with complaints that the pizza is "burnt." It's called an brick oven, take your business elsewhere if you're gonna cry over this.

I am so glad I decided to go get my eyebrows done today. I was initially hesitant because I read on the reviews that she threads from her house but I decided to go for it, it's been bookmarked on my Yelp for a while now. I must say, I am SO GLAD I went! I FINALLY found an eyebrow lady! She threads really good and my eyebrows look awesome. The other Yelper was right when she said that she didn't breakout and I didn't either. She doesn't put any lotions on after which I love, she seems to put some power before the threading, maybe that's her secret. I don't know but all I do know is that I am sending everyone I know to her. You can text her for appointments and make sure you bring cash only. I'm VERY picky about my eyebrows, and she nailed it! Highly recommend!

Above and Beyond Physical Therapy has been a wonderful experience. The guys there are very nice and helpful. This is not your big corporate business, which I like! This is a very small family oriented business that is very personable. I highly recommend Above & Beyond. Everyone there is excellent and the late hours on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays accommodate to your typical 9-5 schedule.

I can't review on the taste because I've never personally tasted it, I'm vegan. But, I can review on the customer service. I have came in here several times to get gifts for my non-vegan friends and clients and have gotten excellent customer service and great responses from everyone I have gifted this to. The ladies in there are so nice. I will be stopping in tomorrow to order a cake for my mothers birthday.

I have a salon where I get my gel manicures monthly, but I tried to book too late and my friend was all booked up (she is THAT good), see my review/pics for my salon of choice. Anyways, I was desperate because after 26 days of quality gel manicure work, my polish chipped. I went to Envy based on Yelp reviews and what a mess! First off, the nail tech had trouble taking off my gel polish so she started grinding my nails, THEN she took the tool that you remove dead skin off your nails and started removing my polish, which resulted in removing some of my layers of nail. UGH! Then she said my nails were to thin and she wanted to add some powder to them that has "vitamins" to make my nails stronger, you know, for more $$$$. UM.... my nails are fine, YOU butchered them. UGH! Never going back again! I'm used to QUALITY work! This salon does NOT meet my expectations!!!

I have heard about this natural beauty bar for quite some time but never really had an interest to go in. After all, all of my skin care products I purchase from Whole Foods and have had great skin for many years. In my younger days, I suffered from incredibly severe acne and was able to cure it on my own by educating myself on skin care, skin care products, ingredients in products, etc. Today, it is VERY rare for me to get a pimple, maybe one every 4-6 months, if that. Although everything in my skin care routine is natural, I was still guilty from using a non-natural tinted moisturizer from NARS for over 3 years now. Although my skin loved it, and it never created problematic skin for me, I decided it was time for me to switch my makeup to a natural and non-toxic one.  A little over a week ago I stepped into Citrine and had a wonderful experience. I was introduced a a BB cream from Jane Iredale which I immediacy fell in love with and was super excited to swap my tinted moisturizer with. I made that purchase on a Friday and wore it daily for about a week. My... Skin... HATED IT!! I broke out very badly! I literally kept a count of how many pimples have formed by the end of the day of wearing that makeup. It was awful. Then I went a couple of days without wearing it, and no pimples. The ladies informed me that my skin may have been detoxing from the switch of makeup, but, I just couldn't bare to keep wearing it any more because I have the biggest fear of acne, it was tragic dealing w/ it in my younger years.  I called Citrine after a week of having this makeup and explained the problem to the manager Jen. She was very nice and very educated on her products but also skin care in general. She welcomed me to come in and we can find a product that's perfect for me. That is exactly what I did today. I went in and we went over skin preparation and application of the BB cream. I learned that a little goes a long way and there is a chance I may have been putting too much product on my skin that caused the breakouts. BUT, because I wasn't sure what exactly it was that made my skin react, I decided to try another product. I was introduced to a new product and we went over application and the ingredients in it. It seems like a winner for now and I am excited to try it. Jen applied it on me while inside the store we found the perfect match for me.  I love my experience and I love everything about Citrine. They represent natural, non-toxic, organic, local, and cruelty free products. This a win-win for everyone. There are many vegan choices as well, from synthetic brushes to actual vegan products themselves, which is excellent. Keep up w/ Citrine on social medics for tip and tricks. I love the message behind Citrine and I will continue supporting 110%.

As I was approaching this store I saw a sign on the door that says "We love puppies, that's why we don't sell them." I read further and there was an educated piece about puppy mills and breeders and how they prefer to support their local shelter. THAT alone deserves 5 stars. I've been there a few times when they have had adoptions and I shopped there as well and had wonderful experience.

My experience was great! I went in for a gelish manicure on my lunch. I already have a salon that I go to & love but I happened to work downtown that day so the drive to Pinnacle Peak was too far for me & I had an event coming up so my nails NEEDED to be done.  My manicure was good. I went in for a nude color but they didn't have any nude colors. Am used to having like over 150+ colors to choose from & the colors at this salon were really limited, which is no biggie, I just went w/ a different color, GOLD (see pic). My nails look wonderful minus the fact that one chipped 4 days later, I'm used to a 2-3 week flawless job on my nails :-( BUT, that's okay, I just filed it down & it's all good.  I also loved that the girls there were able to do a consultation on my hair while I was getting my nails done. I feel comfortable coming back to get my color done as soon as I can workout a good date! Actually, I feel comfortable coming back for anything because I really loved the atmosphere & the people we so nice & casual, which is wonderful.  Maybe I will come back on a Thursday for that vegan pizza I hear they have :-P

OF COURSE, when I said I was done w/ this place because of the hours mixup, I wasn't done. I just cannot get enough of the best burger, oh my goodness, to so delicious. I recently discovered their IG and if you follow them, you will see their weekly specials. I went for brunch a couple of weeks ago, and the pancake special was amazing. I went for dinner tonight and, yum, everything was excellent. Back to being a regular now. Now that I discovered them on IG, I will have a heads up whenever there may be a temporary hour change. I love Braggs!

Went in today for the first time and had a wonderful experience. A younger gentleman there helped me choose a perfect juice for me. I was stuck between two so he let me sample both. He educated me on understanding what cold pressed meant as well as educated me on their ingredients, which are all organic! WIN! I had the Gratitude juice which was half off because it was expiring tomorrow. It tasted super fresh and delicious and it was an awesome meal replacer. My juice had more iron than beef, and more calcium than milk, per Juice Core website. I used to go to another juice place a very long time ago but stopped going there, also a very long time ago, due to my own personal reasons. I had a very genuine experience here, and I look forward to returning and also doing a juice cleanse.

I seriously cannot understand why any adult would want to live here.  1. The prices are ridiculously high, $700+ for a studio. WHY? That's almost my mortgage payment, invest in property, don't rent. And, if your only option is to rent, don't pay a ridiculous high amount, this is NOT an investment.  2. These apartments remind me of what I would imagine would be a cheap hotel. When you open the door to your apartment, it is not the door to the outside, it's a door to the hall. What if a fire happened, I would be shoving and pushing down the hall to make it to the exit. The smell of the halls, CHEAP! I can't even stand it! The carpet is nasty.  3. NO SLEEP!! This is near the I-17, which means traffic 24/7!! The windows are not sound proof, and the many times I have attempted to sleep here have been unsuccessful. I've resulted in buying ear plugs, it somewhat helps.  4. PARKING!! It's so tight, not many guest parking options available, and if there are... it's... so... tight...  5. If you have a pet don't even think about moving here, the deposits and pay, NOT worth it. Deposit that's non-refundable of $250, plus an additional $150 deposit, and then on top of that, a monthly fee. SERIOUSLY? Are we in NYC?  I can imagine if you're straight out of high school or in college and love the idea of "luxury" but can't afford it so this would be your best bet. It's trendy and hip and you want to show it off to your friends. I can understand that, but for any adult or family, I would NOT recommend these apartments, invest in property instead and don't pay these ridiculous high prices for something trendy, especially in this neighborhood.  Great marketing from Acclaim tho, I'll give them that! Their marketing team knows exactly WHO and HOW to market to. All this just leaves me wondering who the heck would pay almost $1700 a month for this? Unsolved mystery!

I had the no cheese pizza. It was really good. I was impressed by the organic options including the USDA certified organic soda. Loved it. I will be back.

I had to fire my other eye brow lady at 16th Street & Bethany & when I did, I didn't think anyone else would be able to do my eyebrows the way I love them. I went to Hollywood Salon to get my upper lip threaded a couple of times & one time I went to get my eyebrows threaded & I wasn't happy. They weren't bad but they weren't what I wanted. I've been threading my own eyebrows for a while & today I decided to go back. I went & the difference between now & last time (other than the girl who did them) is I was firm on what I wanted, thick brows, don't remove the baby hairs, ONLY trim a certain part of my brow, and NO lotion (I use my own organic Shea Butter that I apply myself after I wash my hands). Sita was the one who did my eyebrows & she has also threaded my upper lip before. The lady who did my eyebrows originally wasn't Sita, it was someone else. Sita actually did pretty great, better than my old lady who used to do them. I was surprised. I am VERY happy! When I walked out I wasn't b/c they looked to thin but when I got home & really looked at them I was satisfied! They feel "lifted" but still thick. Just the way I like them.

Whole Foods is so awesome! I absolutely love it here! It's one of the few places I know where I can get products that are vegan and GMO-free. If you go to their bar, order the vegan burger, so delish. Whole Foods is big on organic and supporting local business, and the few people who complain about Whole Foods and their pricing, I found are uneducated about the importance of supporting local and boycotting GMO's. I can't get enough of Whole Foods!!

If you pay with card there is no line to add a tip. But, no worries, you can tell them ahead of time prior to paying how much gratuity you would like to add. If you forget you can add gratuity on a separate check with your debit/credit card. They have vegan options, also vegetarian so thats a bonus. It's definitely not like beyond amazing service but I also never had a bad service so it works out fine.

I had a wonderful pedicure w/ Gaby tonight. I already have a nail salon I go to but I had a credit for Dolce that's over 4 years old that I totally forgot about. I decided to use it. Obviously $60 for a pedicure for me is way too much but with my credit & my discount it was very cheap. In general, I would never pay that much for a pedicure but I understand they are beyond sanitary & clean & the atmosphere is very nice plus callus remover is included, that is what you are paying for. Once a year, or if I have a gift card, I would go again, but other than that, I prefer more reasonably priced pedicures. This 5 star review is for Gaby who was sweet, nice, and just an overall wonderful person! Thank you, Gaby!

I absolutely love this place! They have a vegetarian burger, and, it's actually vegan. House made patty w/ house made vegan nut cheese. I absolutely love it. I don't know if the original bun is vegan BUT you can get it "Adam and Eve" style, or, if you like the carbs, get it w/ the LGO English Muffin, which is vegan. I have had it both ways and love it both way. The staff reassured me that their veggie bun does not contain egg or dairy and that it truly is 100% vegan, and I have asked on numerous occasions. The seats are quick, the service is easy, and it's a great casual place to grab a good bite for anyone even those w/ dietary restrictions.

Why wouldn't I give anything less than 5 stars? Let me start off w/ what I love MOST, other than it being a vegan restaurant, I love the ORGANIC options! YES! I saw that they offer organic tortilla chips, what a bonus, many restaurants try to save on this & offer GMO tortilla chips, that I never eat.  I love that this restaurant uses seasonal foods, supports local whenever they can, and that they use organic whenever possible. My mom & I really enjoyed the food, it was delicious! I cannot wait to go back!  I appreciate the values behind this restaurant and I also appreciate the QUALITY food!

I had 24 Carrots a couple of other times after I wrote my first review & I do agree w/ some of the other reviews that it can definitely be a hit or miss. The first time I went it was great, I even had delicious dessert. The second time I went back it was for a pick up & everything was wonderful. The third time, today, I went back & I didn't like my smoothie, it was overly fruity, and I didn't like my raw cheesecake, it definitely was not up to my standards, but that's maybe b/c I make my own raw cheesecake & can be a little big of a harsher critic. The wait time was not bad, even though they were full. I still want to keep my 5 stars for this place because, again, they are vegan, support local, and use organic whenever possible.  Disclaimer: I do want to say that I could have modified the smoothie b/c I saw the ingredients prior to ordering, but I didn't. It being "too fruity" was definitely not on 24 Carrots :-)

I love this Starbucks because it's never overly packed. It's the biggest Starbucks in Phoenix and it'a very spacious and comfortable. They had to put a code on the bathroom locks because so many homeless people would come to use the bathrooms, some even took showers inside of there. I remember once waiting for a long time to access the bathroom because of that. Now that they put codes, it's been better. The employees are very nice. About a year ago they had gardening for kids and they had a fundraiser for one of their employees who was sick. I like seeing that it's one big family. This is one of my favorite Starbucks!

After my most recent experience, am truly disgusted. The jokes have gone OVERBOARD! "You look malnutritioned as if you are from a third world country." Followed by worse comments which I won't even post!!! I left in tears!!! I'm tiered of being verbally attacked and put down when I come in here!!! It's really sad, this is the reputation this salon has started to get!

I started working out w/ AmenZone a couple of years ago when they toured around the valley. I made sure I attended their community classes when I could. I was super excited when the Biltmore location opened. I've officially been a member since October 2013 and I just can't get enough. Every class is different, the trainers are great, and the results are greater. By eating clean and committing yourself to AmenZone, you can most definitely achieve your dream body. The price is absolutely worth it, believe me.

It was good! I went last week for lunch and had the burrito, and it was delicious. I also had a juice which was delish as well. Today I went and had the Strawberry Warrior for breakfast. It was good, nothing out of this world amazing but it was good. I love the organic and non-GMO deal and I love the vegan foods. The only thing that kept me from going more was having to pay for parking but today I found out they validate parking tickets. Seriously! I've been paying this whole time, LOL!!!

My friend & I tried this place today for a very late breakfast. I have never been there so I was just a bit confused by the menu. Maybe b/c I was just very excited that they offer vegan food as well as organic, I love having great options. When I asked her to explain the menu to me, she did, when I asked another question about the menu (which she already went over), she talked to me really slow as if I was retarded. I get it, you already explained it, I asked a question that was answered, but no need to treat me like I have a mental disorder.   I will say, my order was good, it wasn't great & it definitely wasn't amazing. The presentation of the food was sloppy, which doesn't matter since it doesn't effect the taste, but it's thrown in a small box & it was $10, I definitely was expecting more.  I would say that I would possibly go back sometime BUT the girls customer service was disgusting & that made my decision not want to go back. My friend stated that there was nothing that impressed her and that she will stick to True Foods.  1 star for offering vegan food. 1 star for offering organic food.

Great place! I really needed my dress dry cleaned for an event tomorrow. Two previous places I went to couldn't have my dress ready the same day. I came here and it was no problem. Dropped it off at around 9:30AM and was able to pick it up around the 3:00PM hour. It was a wonderful experience.

I'm getting that next time, this time I had the hummus and the pita bread! I love that the pita bread is so thin! It was awesome! The tea and my hummus were a perfect lunch! And, the service was perfection!!!!

I love this place, but I witnessed something disappointing tonight.  I was in line waiting and in front of me were two gentlemen and one of the two was insistent on trying almost every flavor. He was very indecisive and after each sample he would throw his used plastic spoon into the waste bowl clearly marked "used spoon." He did this several time, almost as if he was making a basket.   His last sample he got, he licked the spoon and threw it in, BUT, he missed and it bounced off of the counter into the ice cream that is served to people. The girl said, "you contaminated the ice cream now." She also stated that it was a "fresh batch." Instead of disposing of the now contaminated ice cream, she continued to serve them.  After I had paid, I sat inside, as I watched a line form of more and more people. In the 10-15 minutes I was there, I did not see her disposing the ice cream that has been contaminated by a used spoon.  GROSS!!!   I had ended up leaving, I really hope that was taken care of. Two stars for it not being taken of immediately, I wonder if it ever was taken care of.  YUCK!!!

I already have a nail salon that I go to religiously & the nail tech there is the BEST in Phoenix, but, tonight I had a nail emergency and needed a gel manicure ASAP and I was in the area so I stopped by Lish. I give it 5 stars simply because it's very customer service oriented, which I love. Everyone seems very involved to make sure you are happy. It was a bit pricer for a gel manicure BUT I do like that I was offered a touch up in case my nails chip the next few days, so I can totally understand. It was a wonderful experience and the gentleman at the front desk was very nice, genuine, and welcoming. This is definitely a great backup salon for me.

Today I needed to purchase a new vehicle for my mother. And, it had to be today, not tomorrow, not next weekend, BUT today. Time is money, and I do not have time nor the patience to be going back and forth w/ dealerships. Initially we looked at a Mirage for my mom, it was too small, so we decided on a new 2015 Lancer. I have purchased my Outlander Sport at another Mitsubishi dealership, in Mesa, BUT the sales manager who helped me out last time, was no longer there. I knew they would make me a good deal regardless as a returning customer BUT I decided to make contact w/ Avondale Mitsubishi first, it's closer.  Sales manager Anthony helped me out prior to my arrival as well as Robert the salesman. By the way, Anthony is pretty awesome, even offered us lunch, really! That was so sweet, I really liked him! We got to the dealership a little before 2:00PM and we were done by 4:00PM. I mostly worked w/ the general manager of Avondale Mitsubishi and completed my paperwork by Anthony. Robert assisted in the beginning by getting me the vehicle I wanted and was patient and attentive w/ mom and I during the test drive. He actually brought us the vehicle I wanted, I told him what color I wanted externally, and what I wanted internally, he brought it to us, and I didn't even have to look around. Perfect.  Long story short, after I wrote all this, I got my mother her Lancer, we were in and we were out. She loves her new car and I would definitely recommend this dealership to my family and friends. I'd buy another car from them most definitely, especially w/ Anthony there as the sales manager.

EKK!   I cannot believe I haven't written a review for CrossFit Archangel as I have been a member for about 4 months now. I came from another CrossFit which was ridiculously expensive compared to Archangel CrossFit, and to be honest, the overall quality of the workouts, equipment, atmosphere, and people is on another level (in a great way) and my previous CrossFit doesn't even compare to.  Archangel is HUGE! I love that you have your own station where you work out, it just really makes it more personal. You can also come in before or after class and use the regular gym which is under the same roof, or the treadmill machine room.  My friends who have been doing CrossFit for years say that Archangel CrossFit is more of your traditional CrossFit. I love the cardio along w/ weights. The results are amazing. They also have a nutritionist on staff, and the owner is very involved and personable and will give you great advice to help you reach your goals.  The only thing I don't like is... absolutely nothing, I love everything about this gym, including the music, which is always a great mix.

YES! I stopped in today to try their vegan donuts that I heard SO much about in the Phoenix vegan community. What I loved most is seeing on their menu that they use ORGANIC sugar and NON-GMO flour, YES! I also absolutely LOVE that their cold brew coffee is local. This is ALL a huge win for me! And, of course, the cherry on topping is the deliciousness! Mark my words when I say that this was the BEST donut I've EVER had! I also saw on their menu that they have vegan ramen! YES! I'll be going back to try! And, the prices, were VERY fair, I was actually expecting them to be higher. Loved this place.

This is a really nice fitness center. I haven't been to the gym in years because I am actively involved w/ CrossFit so coming here tonight was the first visit for me to the gym in over 5 years. This gym may not be in the best location but it's very clean. I mean, overly clean. It's designed really nice and it's also very spacious. I went w/ my friend who is a member & her membership allows her to bring a friend to workout w/ her whenever she goes. I was craving a nice run & I tested out their treadmills for my 2 mile run, it was great. I would definitely come back when my body craves that cardio.

I love this restaurant! I went today for lunch for my first time and had the Tofu Thai Curry. It was so delicious and a nice proportion, I even had left overs for dinner. I also had the Almond Date Milk and it was so delicious. The ambiance was great, very opened, lots of light, lots of green and very spacious. I can't wait to go back for breakfast, super delish!

I have to update my review. I went w/ my friend today and I also went w/ her two/three weeks ago and I must say, both visits have been disappointing.  When we were there today we had ordered the same dish, the curry dish, except she had hers w/ chicken and instead of rice I had mine w/ quinoa. The girl brought it out to me first and I said I didn't want the rice, she apologized and took it back and within a few seconds brings out the EXACT same bowl, except w/ added chicken. WTF!!!   The other time we were there we had both ordered and she got her food first. I waited, and waited, and waited some more, and 15-20 minutes later FINALLY got mine. She didn't eat out of courtesy but by the time I got my food, hers was already cold from waiting.  Limited organic options, which I understand may not be a demand, but you can taste in the food that the quality isn't there, unfortunately. I was a fan when they first opened and I tried a few things on the menu, but, I doubt I'll be returning, especially after the last two visits.

I just cannot even believe the customer service I received tonight at Teaspressa. My boyfriend and I went to DeSoto tonight for the first time and Teaspressa caught out attention. My boyfriend ordered a hot chocolate w/ almond milk and toasted bread with Nutella. He really liked it and he really liked the bread. I decided to walk back to see if I can order just some toasted bread because it looked delicious. My only question was whether it contains egg or dairy, which most breads do not, but, it's always good to double check. Here is how the conversation went w/ the Teaspressa employee:   Me: "Does your bread contain any egg or dairy?"  Him: "Its bread."   Me: "What do you mean?" Him: "Its bread, so yes." Me: "Okay. What exactly does it contain?" Him: "Both! Its bread." Me: "Well, it's rare for me to hear that bread would contain both so that's why I asked." Him: *blank stare*  And, I walked away!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???   Why is this guy trying to make me feel so small and stupid. His attitude was so disgusting, it honestly just gave me a sick feeling to my stomach. I just cannot believe he would try to make me feel so stupid. I am so angry and so mad that I was treating like that. I will NEVER return.   And, to top it of, after all of that, I went to the Noble Bread original website, and under the ingredients for their County Bread, it did NOT contain any egg or dairy, if that is the actual bread they use.  Thanks to the rudest employee I've ever come across for ruining a business that I would have happily been supporting and be a regular at.

I've been coming to Christine since she was at the Polish Room and came in today for my very first appointment at her new suite. It's very cozy and beautiful inside which is an added plus to the great quality work and customer service that is provided. Christine is the queen of nails which makes sense as to why she is very popular in the social media world of nails. She can design anything on your nails and best of all, your nails WILL last. I make my appointments every three weeks, and I to this day have not had any chips in-between my appointments. I highly recommend Christine and five Precious Phan Nails 5 stars.

I went in today w/ my brother. My brother and I had the vegan plate, no meat, no dairy, no animal byproducts whatsoever. It was exactly what I wanted. The plate was big and it was perfect for two people the share. The bread is called teff that's has been in Ethiopia for over 3,00 years (the server informed us). He also informed us that it was high in fiber and iron. I also did some research and found that it was very high in protein as well. I love that they have vegan options, that they use olive oil, and that the customer service was excellent. Also, for the gluten-free lifestyle, they can certainly accommodate toC starting w/ teff.

I went today for a pedicure and I love almost everything about this place. The atmosphere is so nice and calming, I love that there is a pedicure section and a manicure section. It's so clean and very sanitary. The buffers and filers they use, they either give to you or dispose of it, never reuse it. The pedicure stations are outlined w/ plastic to ensure sanitation.  The atmosphere, the cleanliness, the color choices, and the extras available are all great but really what is most important to me (along w/ great sanitation) is getting my ingrows removed. An ingrown is extremely painful and that was my only goal to take care of today. Unfortunately, Gala Salon did not see that I had an ingrown even after informing the nail tech I'd like it removed, she said I didn't have ingrowns.   My polish was great, my feet were smooth, but I left w/ the same problem I came in with. I ended up coming home and attempting to remove my own two ingrowns, I removed partial, couldn't remove full (I didn't have proper tools). After attempting this I messed up my whole polish job, so now my nails are a hot mess.  I would definitely go back, but only after getting my ingrown removed elsewhere. Today was a complete waste tho, as I still have the same problem I was trying to resolve today. Other than that, the overall experience was great and I can't wait to be back. Maybe another nail tech will nail will understand next time I go.

Very exciting that this location is now opened, as of today! I absolutely love Flower Child and I love the vegan options on the menu. They have a seasonal menu and support local businesses, which is great! This is a place where everyone can eat, whether you are seeking gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, or none of the above. This location is great and parking is much more convenient than the 40th Street location! YEAH!!

I just can't give anything LESS than 5 stars! Vegan friendly, they offer house made almond milk as a nondairy alternative as well as unsweetened coconut milk. And, a bonus, like a HUGE bonus, they have vegan whipped cream made from coconuts.  Their lunch and breakfast menu is as pure as it gets. Organic ingredients everywhere. It's great.

Oh man, oh man...  I am SO disappointed w/ my visit today.  Let me start off by saying, my friend and I typically go to LGO and Kaleidoscope between work breaks. We try to support Kaleidoscope as often as we can, even though their drinks do add up, $1 extra for almond mylk, $1 extra for whipped cream, $2 extra for espresso, etc. BUT, we still make it a point to support. I have introduced so many of my friends and co-workers here who have made large purchases for offices, juices for several people, etc.  Today my friend went to purchase a reusable bottle from the Madison, and I told her I would meet her there because I was interested in a cleanse. My friend got there earlier and she wanted a cup of ice for her new reusable bottle, the Kaleidoscope employee informed her it was a quarter. My friend looked through her purse and couldn't find a quarter and didn't want to put a quarter charge on her debit card. She told the employee nevermind she didn't have a quarter for her cup of ice and the employee said okay and that was it.   SERIOUSLY!!!  I was about to look through my purse but my friend was so mad that she said no. All she wanted was a cup of ice. REALLY! After all the business we had given, after all the people we recommended Kaleidoscope to, my friend couldn't get a cup of ice.   I supported ALL of their locations! Downtown, Thompson Peak, etc, and when my friend couldn't find a quarter, the employee just said okay and walked away.   That's so rude, I'm glad I have another option in the area when I need a latte. This wasn't nice at all.

I wanted to write this review based on my experience on Monday March 21st at around 8PM. I was at the bookstore next door and decided to peek in. I was immediately greeted by the nicest gentleman who answered my questions about what menu items can be "veganised." I was really impressed that he was knowledgable that I decided to try dinner there.  Our waitress was wonderful, I believe her name was Bridgette, but don't quote me on that. She had communicated w/ the gentleman who initially answered my questions and was aware of my vegan concern. I initially wanted to try the cauliflower dish, but she informed me that the cauliflower was fried in the same oil they use to fry mean products. Oh my gosh, how amazing is it that she informed me of that. She also informed me that their salad dressing had honey, again, very impressed. She went back and forth and talked to the chef several times, which I felt awful about, BUT, she was so patient and came back w/ a suggestion of a quinoa bowl for me w/ all veggies.  I decided to try it, and it was delicious. I super appreciated that the staff was so accommodating and also the communication w/ the chef was excellent. I was so impressed how educated this staff was about dietary restrictions but even more educated how they went out of their way.  I seriously am so awed by their awesome customer service. When I asked another waitress where he ladies room was, she walked me there. It was so nice, everything was so exceptional and I am so grateful for the dietary restriction knowledge and accommodation.
