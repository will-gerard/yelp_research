Date night done right. The hotel was sold out, so needless to say the restaurant was packed. Which is a good sign! We had an extremely knowledgeable bartender that helped us order drinks and food. We had the shishito peppers and fried green tomatoes with crab. Ended with the Arctic Char. Amazing service and amazing drinks.

First off, I've never written a bad review. I use my reviews to praise exceptional meals and experiences. But this morning, I couldn't help it. My sister and I came in and I ordered the avocado Benedict with spinach and she ordered a la carte poached eggs, avocado, and an English muffin. My Benedict was sopping in egg yolk because the eggs weren't poached properly, the spinach was raw and the hash browns were just shredded raw potatoes hidden deceivingly under a crisp top. My sister's avocado was too hard to enjoy, and her English muffin was burnt. Ps- they charged $8.49 for her meal. She also got one poached egg and one broken egg sitting in yolk on her plate. Our server was nice and accommodating but never asked why weren't eating our meals. We tipped more than appropriately knowing the food was not our servers fault, but we won't be going back.

"Happy birthday, happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday." That's all I heard while dining in at this place. Funny and Kinda awesome. I didn't mention my birthday was the next day. However, this place was amazing. The spicy avocado salad and seaweed salads were amazing. The garlic edamame was delicious. My mother and I enjoyed the Osaka roll which was accompanied by a martini class full of lobster tail and crab salad and the rockstar roll which is excellent for a sushi novice. This is definitely the place for sushi on the west side of town.
