This location must be under new management. I go more often then I should, my son loves the DLC Tacos, and every time we drive thru. The customer service is outstanding! They are so friendly and always make sure my order is correct, which it always is. I have not had a bad experience there aside from some of the questionable customers that show up. This is the only Taco Bell I love to go to.

This is an amazing restaurant. Everyone is very pleasant and helpful. Zach was a great waiter. The food is so delicious!! The deviled eggs were very good. They have French press coffee and it is very good quality coffee too! It is noisy, but that is because it is very popular and for good reason. I can't wait to come back and sit on the beautiful patio.

I give it 5 stars, flame broiled steak was so delicious and the steak and shrimp duo was a perfect deal. The steak was cooked perfectly and the brussel sprouts were so amazing!! Carlye was a wonderful waitress, she made us all feel welcome and took great care of us. I love it when servers treat my son like a person too. Nicole the general manager came to see us to ensure our dinner was good, she's so awesome! I felt as if it anything went wrong (which it didn't) they would have gone above and beyond to correct it.   Highly recommended!

I love this place, everyone is really caring and Dr. Murphy is so wonderful and great with kids. They have awesome perks to help kids want to take care of their teeth. I love that they have yummy coffee for me too :) They have helpful financial programs to help make the braces affordable. I recommend they to all who are looking to an orthodontist. I will be getting braces as soon as my son is finished with his treatments.

I wish I could give them less the one star!! They are rude, impatient and disrespectful. I called to get information and was hung up on repeatedly. When I finally got someone they told me to call the manager then hung up again. Do not go to this place!!! I will never return and will write the manager letting her know how horrible the employees are.

Inside was very warm we had to wait quite a while for a table. They offered for us to sit outside but it was 110 degrees and they have no mister system. The service was VERY slow, I ended up having to get my own napkins and chop sticks as the waiter never brought them or asked if we needed them. My 10 year old son was never acknowledged and that drives my nuts, he is a person and deserves to be spoken to.   The food was good, but everything is fried so I hope you don't want a healthy meal.   Do NOT go there with a groupon, the owner gave me a lecture about how he doesn't make any money off groupons and if I come back with another one he will not honor it. He won't have to worry because there are plenty of other places for me to go where I'm treated much better!

Yum!!!! Great service great food!! The owners are so sweet they accommodated my son and his special request. Food came quickly and is the best I have found here in Phoenix. Highly recommended, clean environment however the women's bathroom needs ventilation.

We came kind of late so it wasn't busy. Nice environment and very friendly staff. The shrimp tacos were very good. My son loved the boneless wings he said to give them 5 stars. Chips and salsa were really good too, nice fresh chips. Salsa was a but spicy but I do enjoy that.

Really good and LOTS of food for the price. The staff was wonderful and very timely. Pork was a little dry but the salsa is great and very spicy. They have a good happy hour to.
