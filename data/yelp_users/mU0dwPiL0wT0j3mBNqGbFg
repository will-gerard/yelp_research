I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.

Love this location. The biltmore is a nice place to stop on my way home from work and I always stop in for at least a piece of cheesecake but the food is great here too. They have so many different options. Mexican, Italian, American delicious.

I didn't give this place 5 stars because the lady at the reservations desk was extremely rude when asked a question about the history of the mansion starting brunch off on that note we walked into the beautiful mansion and made reservations for a window seat of course really enjoying the view and mimosa! Brunch was delicious also with lots of options but they wee out of eggs Benedict

This place was Delicious. Try the Apple bruschetta and the salmon bruschetta. I went on an extremely busy night where they had a $20 board and bottle specials. The wait was over an hour and you were pretty much obligated to use their valet unless you wanted to walk very far so factor that into your budget. The food was really good but the portions are relatively small if you are sharing. Overall I will come back to this place just not on the night they have the specials.

This place was amazing. I ordered tea w honey and lemon and they bought out a whole bowl of lemon and a huge honey dispenser. The monte Cristo sandwich was delicious. Turkey, ham and bacon on a cinnamon toast and Havarti. The biscuits and gravy were fresh and delicious. Our waitress was accommodating and the service was fast.

The atmosphere was great. Authentic Japanese sushi bar. All the sushi chefs spoke Japanese as well as English.   I ordered the hiro roll, Las Vegas roll and one other roll. They were all delicious. The Las Vegas roll was one of the best Vegas rolls I've ever had. Their green tea would taste better sweetened.their miso soup was also delicious.

Really good. We got the spinach con quest and guacamole for a started. The guac was very fresh. I ordered the chimi macayo with and it was delicious. I thought the enchilada sauce would have been a little more flavorful. My favorite was the dessert. We got the deep fried ice cream and added chocolate sauce. It was amazing.

Love their Caesar salad fresh bread with sliced and Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper are nice touches to what is already a good dish. I've had quite a few of their dishes and never been disappointed. My BF an Italian is super picky when it comes to Italian and he likes it.

Personally I love this restaurant. I brought one of my friends who decided to order a healthy option and he was really disappointed with the portion sizes and taste.  If you are coming here order off the menu and be prepared for a little extra calories but a lot of extra taste.

Best authentic Mexican food around. The only place I go when I need a good burrito. Fast service. Their pico and green sauce are both amazing. I usually get a the chimichanga plate or the enchiladas. Carne Asada fries and rolled tacos are excellent too. You can't go wrong

I love rolando's it's better than all the berto's burritos.  I've been going here for years. Wish they were 24 hours again. A drive through would be amazing!! It's worth coming in though. Also they charge .60 if it pay with a card. The green sauce and horchata are the best here

I had a great experience here. It was a good price. I got an appointment quickly after calling and the scheduling was easy. While waiting, I looked at glasses and started trying on. The high end options are locked up but there was someone willing to help me by unlocking every pair I wanted to try on (which was a lot, I'm super picky) and I didn't feel rushed at all even after spending quite some time looking at all my options. I felt they helped me get the best price for my needs and it was buy one get one free glasses! The turn around time was fast although I did call and check if they were ready and they said yes before having ever called me to tell me. I was just very excited to get them. They ordered trial contacts for me also. Picking up was fast and easy. I wasn't waiting forever which is appreciated. I must say this was a good experience and I will be back.

This is the absolute worst walgreens I've ever been to. They don't have a separate person working the drive through window. Don't come here without expecting do wait over 30 mins. The people who go inside take priority and even when you are inside.  I call to make sure my prescriptions are ready they confirmed that they are ready for pick up and then not only are they not ready but they say that they can't refill them! this pharmacy is awful. This has happened multiple times. Switching pharmacies tomorrow

Favorite sub place hands down. The ambiance is unparalleled. The subs are Gourmet for sure. This isn't subway with tasteless veggies and sauces.  Everything here is SO flavorful and they have three 4 locations in AZ I believe. I've been to all except the flagstaff one is next.

As a chai tea addict I had to try the coffee joint all the hipsters are raving about. I went on a Saturday night and the place was packed with a line out the door and every seat in the rather large building taken. After waiting some time I got my chai tea and I was good. Not the best I've ever had but I would go back and enjoy another. The atmosphere was nice and it was a new experience for a relaxed Saturday night.

I went to this restaurant for my 24th bday celebration ! It was really nice! I loved the ambiance and they allowed me to get my balloons delivered as well as my cake. They had a big a bough fridge to bring it out and cut it and served it to everyone at the table as well as bringing it to the back, boxing it up in plastic wrap and different boxes so it would be easy for us to take home. They were great about taking pictures for us and just over all great service. My one complaint is even though I brought my own cake they usually bring out a free desert if there's a special occasion which I would have still enjoyed. I got the shrimp seafood tower that came out with dried ice on a beautiful display. And I had the gnocchi and salad for my main course and it was plenty of food. This place is obviously very pricey but I believe it's the great device, live music and ambiance I was paying for as well as the great drinks and display of the food. Very good. I will continue coming here on special occasions

A little pricey for a place similar to, but better than, paradise bakery, long wait at lunch but SOOOO delicious. I will always eat here when I can! My favorite is the salmon chopped salad with arugula. I'm usually not a big fish person and never really loved salmon but it is the perfect combination in this salad. Not your typical salad. I also love the frittata for breakfast or brunch

I go to fear farm every year. They change it up enough that it's always worth going the next year.  They have 5 haunts and a corn maze. Personally I park across the street at the huge Costco parking lot and take the crosswalk back to fear farm that's located right across the street because there are cops that will see if you are jaywalking.  The line to get into the fear farm parking lot is always long and they charge to park in their dirt lot filled with potholes. Save on parking and pay extra for a fast pass! It's worth it!  One thing they changed is they took out the photo booth with the clowns and you can still take pictures with them on whatever camera you have but the lines are unorganized and the lighting is bad. The haunts themselves are scary and this close to Halloween any haunted house will be crowded try to go during the week if you can.

The amenities are great. The resort and spa itself was wonderful although hard to find an I felt someone should have directed us where to go better after asking two different employees we found it. It was very relaxing and beautiful. After we got salon styles which were quoted at $25 a piece. I got one for my mom also.  There was only one girl working named Ani. She was extremely rough. I was straining my in order not not bend my head backwards and also a lot of my hair was being ripped out of my head and breaking off from the amount of force she was using to round brush my hair. She seemed extremely rushed. After telling her where I part my hair she parted it on the wrong side because "it looked like it wanted to go that way" and than charged an extra $25 for curls and I leave and my hair is wavy. For the price they should do an amazing job. I ended up going home and re curling my hair because it was almost completely straight before arriving home.

They had delicious healthy options, the wait wasn't horrible even during the breakfast rush. I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the "smokey stuffed portabella mushroom" (intentionally spelt wrong) and a chai tea. It was healthy without being bland and the chai was one of the best I've had.

I asked for a green tea with light ice sweetened. I got a green tea unsweetened. When they remade it they added extra ice and I got a nice 4 cup of ice.  My uncle ordered a drink and in the time my drink was remade and completely drank his drink still wasn't made. After complaining to the management (Eddie) they still didn't make it. We were waiting 30 mins on one starbucks frapp. He was extremely rude! I've never had this bad of service at a starbucks

Lots of options. Good subs. I ordered the Georgetown with all the veggies and it was good. I feel like the veggies could be more flavorful but similar to jimmy johns and subway. I like the vibe and the music they play. Rock music like blink 182 and ever clear and a old mining town theme throughout. Very nice and helpful staff.

I wish there was more parking. It's a pretty busy corner but once you get inside you have the option of all day breakfast, sandwiches, salads a coffee bar and surprisingly a grocery store. I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was AMAZING! I felt like the side of lintels should have been served hot but they were still delicious. $15 for the rancheros and a small chai. The chai was delicious. They don't have dome lids so if you ask for whipped cream you won't be getting a full drink. Over all I would definitely recommend this place. It's different, healthy and delicious.

The food is not only healthy but extremely flavorful. I ordered the spicy pad Thai and the spring rolls. Both were amazing. I ordered my pad Thai less spicy and it was perfect.  I also ordered the chrysanthemum tea, sent it back for the green tea that tasted much better.  I finished off with the chocolate cake. A little dry but very flavorful.      The only thing I would change is the order set up

Very good.  When you check in you get a free appetizer! Every yelper can get excited over that. I chose the spinach artichoke dip and it was good, on the heavier richer side but yummy! Than I ordered the sliced steak salad which was delicious but drenched in dressing. We finished up with the lava cake which was AMAZING! So decadent. They had chocolate ice cream on it instead of vanilla and I loved it! The bite of cold ice cream warm cake  and hot filing was just SO good. I'm talking drive her again just to have the lava cake good.  Worth the splurge on calories

One of my favorite pho places. The portions are large and easy to take home for later.  They are not stingy at with the add ins. My only complaint is the odd hours. They are closed around dinner time. I have shown up a few times and they have been closed which was really disappointing because this restaurant is across town for me and by that time I was starving. I just call before hand now.

If I want a complicated design I can count on my nails to look absolutely perfect here. I wish I had pictures of all the nails I got in the past but they take time to make your nails look exactly like whatever picture you bring in or whatever design you want. You get what you pay for here.  I usually get the basic mani pedi but when I do splurge and get upgraded mani pedi's they are amazing, they can include hot stone massage and paraffin dips with lots of amazing massaging. This is the only place I know of that does a small shoulder massage with the pedi's. I get Scottsdale work with Phoenix prices here . The salon is clean and pretty. I liked it better before they remodeled but still very nice and upscale inside.  Like I said they do the best designs and take their time to get it right. AND they speak English. Most of the girls speak fluent English. Some will need translating from the other girls but I've never had a problem

The lounge was a free as opposed to the sky bar. It was a great atmosphere and also served food. The filet Mignon was so delicious. The tomato fondue was good but I expected something thicker and cheesier. Tasted similar to paradise bakery soup. Beautiful view. Relaxing and romantic. Also had a bar area for mingling.

Our room was $229 and we were upgraded to a king size on the 15th floor. Beautiful view of the strip and the Farris wheel. Plenty of room. The bath tub was my favorite part. It was a huge jacuzzi tub. You are able to stretch out and you can look out the window at the strip from the tub. Perfect after a long night in heels.

I LOVED this theatre. So upscale. It makes a movie date special again! There is a separate bar if you feel like hanging out after. I feel like this place would be perfect for a first date. Now to the chairs, they are the most comfortable out of any upscale theatre I've been do. They recline quite a bit and are big and soft. Plenty of room between you and the next person. Free popcorn with the luxury seats. I tried the truffle fries and the 50 shades of green juice and enjoyed both a lot.  The green juice is lite similar to true food refreshers. The truffle fries aren't crunchy but I like that, I wish they gave me more ketchup with them because asking for extra wasn't convenient when I'm the middle of the row and immersed in the movie. My one complaint was the kids sitting next to me! The parents were and the end of the row 2 seats down from their children not Paying any attention to them and their kids were directly next to me! Two kids in one seat continuously reclining the seat and putting it back up with their cell phone flashlight on disrupting everyone in the vicinity. Someone asked me to tell them to stop and they weren't even my kids! This is not fault of the theatre though just bad parenting.

I'm sure my review will change once I actually get into olga's I called the number on their website. Made an appointment and drove 30 minutes for a $25 wax. I was told to go downstairs and my mother and I went to two girls downstairs. Both waxes were mediocre at best and one of the ladies filled my eyebrows in with really dark shadow using a fluffy brush. I feel clownish. Misleading when there is only one number for multiple different places.

Coming into the restaurant it had a great view. Nice outdoor bar with cooling and twinkling lights.  Anytime I go out to eat I read yelp reviews and every single one was bad. But we had already sit down so we decided to stay and eat. The chimi was recommended by the waiter so we ordered. Very heavy. Lots of onions. Expensive and drinks are basically water. Welcome to Vegas

Kathryn is the knowledgable, friendly and a genuinely caring person She let me socialize with my puppy and her mom many times until my puppy was big enough to come home with me. It really made the experience better watching my puppy grow and getting to know her while also learning about the proper ways of caring for a Maltese puppy.  If I have any questions I call Kathryn and she always gets back to me right away. My Maltese is the best dog I could ever ask for. Smart, sweet tempered, loving, playful, healthy and beautiful. I highly recommend Bella dolce Maltese if you are interested in a Maltese puppy.

This is without a doubt the best buffet I've ever been to. The wait was really long. Over an hour wait but it was Easter Sunday. The food was great and had a very large selection.  Being a foodie I had to try a little bit of everything (impossible here) and there wasn't anything I didn't like.

I want to give this place 10 stars. The portions are very large. The prices are very reasonable and the sushi and Teppan are both AMAZING. I ordered viva Las Vegas roll, bill roll soft shell crab roll. Bento box 2 and the ny strip.  Great service. Fast. And again the food is top notch.  I heard of this place on groupon and it was a little far but is worth the drive.

I was referred here by Jordan for the Miss Arizona USA pageant and I have never been happier with a spray tan. I'm already slightly tan naturally and was scared of looking unnatural or orange. Jackie recommended the tan that you let develop and wash off two hours (or so) later depending on the shade you want. After I washed it off I am so happy with the beautiful bronze tan that I am left with. It isn't rubbing off on my white robe and I think it will look great on stage!

I have to give this place a 5 star rating. We ordered the trio sampler appetizer. I loved the bean/cheese dip. Didn't care as much for the hummus. I ordered the pulled pork burrito and it came with mac n cheese and potato salad inside. This was one of the best things I have ever eaten. My friend ordered the thanksgiving dinner burrito with stuffing cranberry sauce mashed potatoes and turkey with gravy on the side also one of the most delicious things. I am glad I got to split these because they were both so good and one burrito is plenty for one person. I loved the atmosphere and music. The waitress was nice. Wish she filled my water a bit more but still good overall.

I'm always pleased with the service here. It's fast and the food is high quality and delicious. They do accommodate healthier options, you just have to ask for sauce on the side or no salt or oil for any of the dishes. The staff was so friendly and nice. I left my to go box on the table and the waitress actually ran out to the end of the parking lot after me to give it to me! I couldn't believe it but it was VERY appreciated! Definitely recommend this place for good family style Asian cuisine!

It's taco Tuesday on cinco de mayo and for some reason this place is dead. That should have been the first red flag. We sit down at the bar after standing at the sign That said wait to be seated for 5 mins while the ONE waitress at the bar looks at us not saying a word. We have to ask for menus that are thrown down in a pile. We ask what specials are and wait as another bar tender comes out. They two seem really busy at the computer for quite some time. More people come to the bar waiting. Another group asks for a waitress and finally leaves after no service. I think this place is poorly staffed and managed. 4 different groups left just in the time we were there without eating or drinking. This place should have been pack on cinco de mayo.

Seriously! This idea is so cute! Girls in 115 degree weather serving coffee in bikinis. I met the owner as well as another employee and both were so nice. Let me take pictures with them and also the coffee was GREAT and reasonable in price. The only thing I would say is I wish there were more locations! This location is a little bit out of the way for me but I will definitely go again. I ordered the chai tea in a DD cup! Yes they make boobie references on their menu haha love it

This place is delicious. You order inside and they bring you your food. The restaurant is beautiful. The outdoor patio is so pretty and has string lights lining the outside. I really enjoyed the crepes and everyone loved their sandwiches. The staff was so awesome and when they made a mistake left the food for us to enjoy. Definitely recommend this place. Outdoor patio is dog friendly also.

This place is pretty fast for delicious healthy food. They have a huge variety and a kids menu. The chicken hummus plate is somewhat deceiving.  It's a salad with s tiny bit of hummus dressing.  Other than the the service was good and quick but pretty pricey. $30 for 3 people to eat 1 item and drinks/cookies/chips not included.
