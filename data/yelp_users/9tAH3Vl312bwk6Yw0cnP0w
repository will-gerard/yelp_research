The only reason it got a two stars is because the waitress was great!! The food was not good at all maybe it was a bad night who knows. Little disappointed as this place is right around the corner from my house and it looks like I will need to find a different place to grab a bite to eat. I'm not going to beat this place up with a long drawn out review all I am going to say is sadly I don't plan in coming back.

Let me start by saying WOW!!!! Talk about great sushi......I have been to a ton of places in PHX,Seattle, San Diego, San Fran etc. and this is by far the best I have had...I'm a little apprehensive on actually posting this just because there is limited spaces to eat at this place and I don't want a ton more people showing up but I thought that would be a little selfish and I don't really have a ton of people reading my post so it couldnt really hurt. But if you are in the area and you are reading this I would recommend you take a second and try this place out. Again great sushi and great service.

I would give this place two out of five stars. The service was so so and the prices were a little high for Pho. It was ok but don't plan on going back.

Had my dry cleaning done here and it was a train wreak. First they had the wrong ticket on my dry cleaning, then the girl I was talking to insisted that the dry cleaning that was attached to my ticket was mine I asked to see the log of dry cleaning and once she showed it to me I was able to prove to her that the dry cleaning she was presenting to me was not mine. At this point she said she didn't know what to do and I would need to talk to the manager. Lucky me because at that point the manager walked in. After talking to him he apologized for the mistake and told me he would call the place where the dry cleaning was dropped off at. (I had no idea they outsourced the dry cleaning to Rose cleaners a block away) once he got a hold of the dry cleaning place where my clothes were at he informed me that they should be done later that day and would call me when they came in......wait for it.....a week later after being out of town and not being able to come in and NEVER receiving a call from anyone I checked on my dry cleaning and to my luck it was there and was done. Long and short this maybe a great place to go get your laundry but stay away if you are getting dry cleaning done.

Let me start by saying I love Einstein bagels but this has got to be one of the worst ones I have been to. The guy behind the counter was on the phone the whole time while he was taking orders and the service has always been poor. The coffee is never full and the over all appearance is dirty and sub par. I would recommend going to the one off of 101 and chandler if you leave anywhere between the two.

This place is great. I'm closer to the jimmy johns sub shop they just opened but I drive up here to get my lunch. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Awesome. Great people and great food. So I walked in here not really expecting to much but wow...this please was great and they have an all you can eat sushi which included everything on the menu and dessert items too. Needless to say I may have ate too much but it was well worth it.   I will be come back next time I am in town.

So I walk in and it being my first time here my face must have gave it away because the owner walked up to me and asked if this was my first time here. He then walked me through the process, almost everything is made to order except for the daily combo they are already precooked. He handed me a menu which is fairly basic but had some great items on it. I walked up to the cashier and she was friendly and welcoming she gave me some ideas and help me decide on what to get the Mu shu wrap.....AWESOME.... It was stir fry, rice and chicken wrapped in a tortilla, it was heaven.   I would totally recommend this place and will be going back!!!

Ok so this place would have been 5 stars if my creme brûlée wasn't burnt, yes I'm that picky. Lol.   Let me start off by saying the waiter was awesome on point and always following up with us, he gave suggestions and always had a smile in his face. Now for the food- we started off with the calamari and it was AWESOME....I asked if the had Cannelloni but I was out of luck fortunately the waiter suggested something else the chicken pasta with mushrooms (not the correct name but you should be able to find it on the menu) and it was great. The over all atmosphere was great and service was on point. I will definitely be going back.

Just had breakfast and it was great. This place is top notch in my book I will have to come back here more often. Not to busy and a very friendly staff.

Ok so i had to update my previous rating on this place. Lou thanks for responding to my last post really means a lot that you read these and take action so with that in mind here is my update.   I love this place Kyle and Lora are by far my favorite bartenders but you can't forget about Erin love her up beat and always fun attitude. Lou you have a great local bar here and thank you for the ice cold beer and great environment. By the way please bring back or let me know the days you have the potato soup it's freaking amazing.

Bacon bacon bacon!!!!! Awesome!!!   Some of the best think crunchy bacon I have had.   Been here several times and each time I am greeted with a smile and great service. The food is always fast and has great flavor. You can really tell that the owners care about service and their customers.   Keep it up I will be coming back for more.  Thank you.

Bleh bleh bleh bleh! Fairly disappointed with this location. Drink Dutch bros coffee almost every day when I'm in town but this location comes in below the bar for sure. No issues with service or personality but when you specialize in coffee I would expect it not to taste like my beans were burnt to a crisp in a pan full of oil. This experience will not not stop me from returning to my usual locations but will definitely find a new spot on this side of town.

Great place great people.   I have been to a few crossfits and you always seem to run into that super douche bag guy or guys that just want to apart of the next new thing and show off how cool they are, well if you looking for that type of gym this is not that place. All of the people here seemed super cool and are great motivators.  All down to earth and are willing to help and work with anyone.   If you want to check out a great crossfit this is the place.

Well where do I start?? I am a huge fan of pretty much any good Mexican food, but this place was a huge let down. I went with my fiancé she ordered the street tacos and I decided to try the burrito because I was a little hungry, we also decide to order some chips and guacamole. The portions were small and overall very over priced.   Here is a breakdown on the food.   Guacamole and chips- the chips were stale and the guacamole was not that good. Not to mention the portions were small.   Burrito-very small but had ok flavor   Street Tacos- very small with a very limited about of meat on each of them not to mention that the meat was cold and lacked real goof flavor. Only one taco was good I don't remember which one other then it had pink meat.   Don't plan on going back.

Love this Dutch bros. The whole team is always out going and brew the coffee perfect each time.
