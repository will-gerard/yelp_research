The cherry hef and the vanilla porter were A-ok.  Were they my favorite? No. Were they bad? Not at all.  Would I consider buying this stuff in a pony keg for our place? probably not.  They have a decent happy hour in which if we were close by I would rather stop here than going to a place like hazelwoods or dillys deli.  But since St.Francis is across the street I would personally choose them over this.  Had a manmosa yesterday for my bday which was awesome thats probably one drink I would definitely stop in for.

For starters let me begin by telling you that this was not my choice to come here for my birthday after a long day of activities where I had maybe 3 drinks in the morning and by 10 O'clock after the Dodgers and Giants game had a severe migraine so bad that I was becoming severely nauseous to where all I really really wanted was a small cup of coffee in hopes to get rid of the migraine so I would be able to eat some of my food.  So when men want to sit here and criticize my review by saying I was a "drunk" that is far from what I am EVER.  The ambiance of this place is nothing amazing with its outdated decor going on.  The waiters are all men and have been with the establishment for years on end besides the waiter we had which he says he was there for 7 months and said he was waiting tables for over 20 years (so he says) I found that hard to believe for some reason since the whole time we were there he not once brought out my coffee.  Also when I had ordered risotto my step-dad had told my sister and I that if we didn't want to eat now (because we were just eating over at chase field for the dodgers and dbacks game) that we could save the food for later which was WHY i ordered food in the first place. I had no intention to order to be perfectly honest.  I am kind of wishing I NEVER ordered anything at all the way all of the waiters and chef came out to basically yell at me for not touching my food. I really wish i was so  sick that i would have thrown up all over the place the way they were treating me on my birthday I felt so bullied.  So when OUR waiter took my food to be bagged up to take home he never brought it out for me to take home.  Yet my families food all got packaged up and brought back within a matter of seconds. Our waiter then brought out a very soggy tiramisu in which I have never had it that way ever and googled to see if I have just been eating it the wrong way my whole entire life.  No where on google does it say that its supposed to be that soggy.   It was not until we were almost home I had forgotten my food since it was never once brought back out like we wasted our money for not eating my food right then and there. If im not mistaken i am pretty sure that the owner and chef were the same person.  In that case I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future if the owner is that much of a douchebag to with hold my food because I was feeling so sick and just wanted some coffee the whole time I was there.  I should not have to repeat myself to have to ask for things consistently.  It is the waiters job to assess the situation and to be understanding.  Not to be a jerk the whole time and not ask if there was anything else he could have got me besides my food. like...my Coffee!

I wish this place was closer to our condo. For 1.25 tacos and their Carne Asada tacos aren't like ground beef with no extra weird stuff on it I'm almost in love. Definitely not my favorite place for Carne Asada tacos but definitely not my least favorite.  We will see you again soon my friend.  Oh a word of caution.  My boyfriend ordered a pollo asado burrito with beans cheese sour cream and rice and asked for the enchilada sauce to be put in the inside of the burrito and its always the same result....outside as usual. We need to Learn how to speak Spanish so we can get it right everytime :(

OH MY GOD.  I completely understand how employees want to go home and not have people walking in when they are closing; but one day my mom and my siblings came to this location maybe 2-3 hours before closing time so  we thought we were okay. NO. The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors.       So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion. But that is a whole other story.

Think of like an applebees but with a marginally better ambiance if that is even possible.  There is not one thing that came to our table of four that was mouth watering good to where you cannot wait to come back to try the rest of the menu.  I had ordered the firecracker shrimp in hopes that it would have some hell of a kick to it with that name.  The shrimp tasted like it was frozen too long and then had that really fishy taste and absolutely drenched in salt hundreds of times to where I felt like I was going to get sick and eventually by the end of the night I did end up getting sick from the food.  My boyfriend had ordered a sandwich and a cheese dip before we had ordered that was not anything to rave about.  Our friend had ordered the burgers and fries and could not even finish half the burger and couldn't even touch her fries and I was too scared to even ask to try them as to why she couldn't continue. The firecracker shrimp I had ordered I had to make sure i wrapped them in the tortilla to be able to even eat them.  For the first time ive ever been to a restaurant and thought "they gave me too much shrimp". When normally I would be more than ecstatic to have an over abundance of shrimp.  Definitely never going to go back with how bad the food was and even the service now that I think about it wasn't all too great I kept hoping to god the waitress would have came over to ask if I needed more water.  But she was barely around to ask.  What a shame.

I don't care for too much sonic but what i do like sometimes is the happy hour from 2-4 for the drinks.  Tater tots aren't too horrid either. I love the idea of the Texas toast with a burger patty and what not but i never tend to crave sonics so its rare for me to make a stop since Mcdonalds is half a mile away with obviously better deals than sonic.

When you want to know where to go for poor customer service this place is the perfect definition of it.  Never again will i step foot after our first and last visit to this horrid establishment. Customer service in my eyes plays a HUGE Role. If you are treated poorly what is the purpose to come back with their food not being anything amazing as well. We had come to this establishment for sushi night and sake bombs for the boys.  Their small sake bottle they give you with a huge bottle of beer to match but doesnt match really because theres maybe 2-3 shots worth of sake and the beer with sake should be about 5-8 shots rather than 2-3.  After waiting for our food for a good amount of time passed our huge amount of food ordered came out and was decent but not for the price we paid.  Not A Deal! What so ever.  So as we are still having a good time eating and talking to one another about random things and what not, my boyfriend got up to look at something on the TV since it was close by but not close enough for him to see what the score was on a game so as he got up to look the restaraunt was closing up and we were the last 2 couples in the place putting money in their pockets for the day; the owner or manager in a little button up tommy bahama type looking short asian man had gone up to my boyfriend and said CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?! Very rudely said, and my boyfriend responded No, i was just checking the score. The Manager basically cut him off and said WELL THEN LETS GO! so my boyfriend came back to the table and had said i think they want us to go so we closed our check and had hurried as fast as we could. I understand when establishments close it is time to go!  But if its a mom and pop shop or restaraunt i believe in more or better customer service in order to get a tip.  I do not believe i have to tip over 15% if i was treated poorly. My boyfriend is too nice when it comes to tips in my opinion i believe people need to work for their money and just not expect so much from people if they don't try hard enough.  You treat me poorly i don't return or i excpect an apology of some sort.  If not you can expect no more money from my bank account.    Their food and service what we paid for was ridiculous. I Will Never Ever Return. I Hope they Shut down. I think if a wait staff is really nice we would have been treated better then this on our first time here.  For what we paid i could have gotten triple the food in other place i know of. And as far as portions go 3/4 of the people that went including myself were still hungry leaving.

The yogurt was pretty tasty for a mom and pop shop. I usually get way too over excited for the do it yourself scoop your toppings on your own type fro-yo places but i figured id give this place a shot. As far as their flavors go from the one i have tried so far-decent. Nothing mind blowing YET. but decent...No mochi topping (-1 star) every fro yo place has mochi! Except mom and pop places. *tear* yes...i am really docking a point because of that because i am just weird like that okay?  It's like going into a Boba tea place and them running out of boba or not even having any. It is slightly upsetting.  I am half Filipino so i LOVE boba and mochi how typical right?   When i am back in the area i will have to try yet another flavor but until then they still have my business with their other flavors i am excited to try and fall in love with minus the fact that there will be NO Mochi toppings im sure because i am pretty sure most of you are not aware of what it is. (google it!) ;)

I typically do not favor subs at all or crave them to say the least. I do not know how jimmy johns stays in business for example. The only thing decent there in my opinion is their bread which is not even phenomenal. Ned's Subs are up there with subway in my book.  Their Chicken sandwich tasted exceptionally fresh(my best word to describe the taste). I like Fresh things so works out perfect for me! We had stopped here randomly because we had thought the name was funny as we were driving through the parking lot looking for harbor freight.  Next time i am around this area i will again make my stop to try a totally different sub and then onto some fro-yo!  :)

The thin crust pizza here is the best I've had in the valley. The thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. But boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  We always used to come here on Tuesdays to get the Tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. When we called today to go get the usual Tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. So now that they have taken away my Tuesday special I can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none.  I'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever I guess. I will miss you nellos very much I will but I guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87....sigh.... :(

Whoa Whoa Whoa! How Have I NOT written a review to crackers yet?! Crackers and Co. is my absolute favorite breakfast place by far.  I rant and rave about how i always want to go because...I LOVE Breakfast!  Their country potatoes are to die for when you get them served fresh. Now i am not saying they have came out gross before i just do not like eating potatoes or french fries after i have left a restaurant they just aren't the same. I cant believe someone thinks their food is bland. they must have made a wrong choice somewhere.  Everything i have gotten has been amazing to say the least.  For some reason i always get the skillets and go back and forth with which one i will get.  But the most recent time i went i got their super amazing french toast that melts in your mouth like cinnabon but not as sweet where you feel as if you will die in the next hour. No the French toast is perfect but next time i will only get one slice not 6. Their biscuits and gravy are pretty damn good too. the sauce isn't watery or soupy but just amazing.  My sister has tried one of the omelletes i just cannot remember which one. i will be trying one today when i finish getting ready for the day. which of course im looking forward too. make sure when you get to crackers if you enjoy lemonade order yourself the strawberry lemonade its my favorite! More than Hot dog on a sticks lemonade which i drink on a regular basis working in the chandler mall.    Oh one more thing...If you want superb customer service every time go to this location that is behind home depot.  I have been to the Tempe location 3 times now and 2 out of 3 times the customer service was just mediocre to poor. the most recent time a friend and i went our waiter was finally nice thank god. For some reason their hostess doesn't come off pleasant what so ever and obviously doesn't care about quality customer service on weekends(which is when i went once) . But the mesa location is so far my favorite and i cant wait to stuff my face with some of crackers and cos amazing food! :)

Our new found love...  The 5 for 5 deal is absolutely amazing if you have a basic DVD player or are looking to watch a movie that's obviously older; since blu rays are excluded from the 5 for deal. What my boyfriend and I love about this place it's obviously locally owned which we are all about. The guys that I've talked to that work here are always so nice which I've said in previous reviews is extremely refreshing and what I look for in a business establishment. I like to be treated fairly is that too much to ask for nowadays??? Their extended movie rental pricing is awesome as well and don't charge you an arm, leg, or first unborn child for not getting it to them right on the dot which is also another reason my boyfriend and I go back.   Only con to this place is that if you are looking for something in specific that's older, more than likely it will not be available to rent. Like when I went tonight two of the three movies I wanted to rent were not available. Just my luck. Oh well. Will have to keep going back to check and see if they will be returned every day.

Mmmmm....Los Favs....Their breakfast burritos are always on point and so is their Carne Asada which are my personal favorite in the state so far compared to (Fillbertso) Filly bs,and rubias in tempe on mill and southern? i think that's the name of the other spot. Favs always get it right though for the most part. Lately they have been overcooking the french fries but it is still amazing regardless.  Their burritos seem pretty small to me compared to taqueira me casita or whatever on warner and dobson but their california burrito is my quick i don't really know what i want so i'm gonna choose this option. Like i said, i usually get the carne asada fries or the breakfast burrito because you can never go wrong with either selection.        I seriously have been thinking about it all night and i am always more than excited to go every time. I am a typical foodie so excuse the excitement as i text as i am preparing for my day of work and stop for my breakfast burrito along the way ;) I once ordered rolled chicken tacos and it was extremely bland and just meh. I wanted to throw it away after i ate one out of three. But my friend made me pack it up. So not only did i end up wasting my food but i wasted a container. i cannot force down food just because that is definitely not my style to say the least.        Living in Arizona you will find hit or miss places, i have heard a lot of people say this is just as disgusting as Filly B's but i beg to differ. Filly b's is just beyond nasty and my stomach always hurts after eating their overly salty carne asada fries. gross. okay back to Favs. I don't necessarily care for the fact that they charge you extra for sour cream,cheese, etc etc etc in your burrito. I am spoiled from the mexican spot down the street on warner and dobson because they load your burrito in front of your face with two scoops of rice, beans, and 2-4 scoops of meat depending on what meat and if u ask for half and half. and let you add in sour cream cheese and whatever else for free. the burrito looks as though its the size of some buff guys bicep. HONESTLY. Favs burritos are half the size of a regular sized girls forearm for 4 dollars compared to 6. their prices on breakfast burritos and carne asada fries are always in my budget though.   Los Favs Here I Come!!! :D

We had come on a Sunday night and for some bizarre reason a birthday was being held in the bar area.  So with that being said it was impossible to get around to go to the bathroom directly unless you went the long way and then when it came to our food and drinks the older lady that was our server took forever to come over to bring us our food and drinks regardless if it was a soda or water.  Whenever i go to restaurants and am thirsty the servers wont be there to ask if you would like a refill or not. but the days i am not thirsty they are there non stop which is great.  Bad luck maybe.  The chicken tacos were disgusting. The fish tacos apparently were okay. So next time i suppose I should try that instead of the chicken tacos.

This probably might be the only favorite Pho spot I have ate at in Arizona so far.  I feel like there is definitely more to try on the menu for sure thats undiscovered by me quite yet but its just so hard to stray from the known and true.  I am not a fan of tendons tripe etc etc.  Keep it pretty simple with the strips of beef and meat balls. As well as the egg rolls number one or two on the menu I believe.  I also love how affordable they are and can always just hop skip and jump across the street when I am not feeling well to get some soup.  If you have not been...I urge you to go...NOW!

Personally I'm not exactly a fan of the prices here most of the time. Only thing i go to this store for is for the family specials in the deli with their large pizza and it comes with bread sticks/ a bag of salary/ wings and sometimes their pork shoulders to make pulled pork with. The pizza here is the one thing you can rely on me to go to bashas for because it worth every penny. they used to have an awesome deal on the family special until recently they charged me 16.99 for the "deal" i will now only stick with the pasta until they bring back the "deal" before unless one girl working at the deli counter wants to continue to rip me off. One guy knows my bf and I to come for that deal so hopefully he gives us some insight as to what the hell is going on with our beloved Family special.

Oh coffee rush, how i love you soo very much. Their coffee is always on point to me, and their iced chai tea latte is amazing! i think i will have to either go down to getting non fat milk or sugar free because their mochas are very sweet but still amazing.  Ive never had a bad experience with customer service.  All the guys that have made my coffee have always been nice. Not fake nice either. Just plain nice. Sometimes i felt as though i had been intruding one of the main guys working or whatever but i always stop in for my 32 oz iced mochas on my way to work.  I know how customer service can be kind of annoying when you have to deal with annoying rude customers i have worked with people like that for over 8 years so honestly i know. I HATE IT. I always try to treat people the way i would want to be treated and i would never put any pressure on someone preparing my food or drinks! rudeness will never get you anywhere. Now my favorite mocha by far...im not sure they are all good but just so you know the tiramsu mocha might be my favorite once i get the non fat milk or soy. i was hoping someone would have been adventurous and told me how it tasted. all i have to say is that it is good. All the mochas seem overpoweringly sweet except the black and white is perfect right in the middle but too thick of milk where i feel like im gaining 10 lbs per drink. bleh. tomorrow i will try the cherry mocha with the pecan baklava. im crossing my fingers i will love it too... or i might just get the tiramasu again but with nonfat milk...hmmm the choices! :)

I come here for one thing...   The grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.   Believe me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.  Horchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story.

Lee Lees Will Never EVER top ranch 99 ever. I am Just Sayin.  Lee lees has a decent selection of items here but i don't necessarily care for their prices on certain things per say.  Example, California (More expensive price of living) but cheaper bigger tins of the ice cream(cannot think of the brands right now). For 5.00 of the same ice cream its triple the size in California and 1/3 of the size in Arizona. That makes a lot of sense. Also i have not been able to find any good red bean bread or ube bread or ensymada with ube or coconut in it here or anywhere in Arizona. What is going on in the world?! I understand there is not as many asians as there are in California where i grew up in like Asia town (i am half) where you could find anything Asian related food wise every block.  The first thing i had to find out if there was decent boba here there is(but still does not beat Nor Cal's)  So the fact that everything i really want is not here is the reason for the negative star.    I never really expect QUALITY Customer service at asian markets only because my mom used to work at one when i was very little and you can't expect the best. That is just me.  That is like someone who gets irritated that someone cannot understand what some indian people are saying or people that think anyone that comes into the united states needs to be able to speak fluent english. IT WONT HAPPEN. You just have to learn to accept it and move on.  Just like i do with lee lees. I do not love it, i do not hate it, it gets me by and that's all i need.   OOOOOH also important tip!! You get 10% off at the register for no reason every day any time! ;)

The little old man that works in the front is always so funny and nice to see every time we go in to order food. The teryiaki chicken and the orange chicken is amazing so is the curry chicken but i ask for no onions every time and they never take it out. the man always puts it in parenthesis and i guess it doesn't help? Oh well. I love this place regardless. i want to try everything else to be adventurous and taste all the amazingness and once i try everything else i will post another review to update because every time i need certain reviews on certain things i can never find anyone to say anything about it.

Once again i have found an all time favorite dish at this fine establishment.  The House Chicken! If you do not like mushrooms what so ever or do not care for spicy food i do not think this will appeal to you. Oh my god it is out of this world! I do not think i could consume it every day back to back but every other day or once a week would be my preference.  Its even amazing when its warm not burning hot temp. wise.  I will edit this review and add in more as i try more on the menu to keep you all posted. So for anyone who wants a little spice and kick in your mouth with yummy mushroom this is for you!  :D

I was debating on whether if i found it A-OK? or If i am a fan now? I had received coupons in the mail from money mailer and didn't want to go to jimmy's on Warner and Arizona/Holmes? Never feel completely comfortable there.  majority of the time they talk in Vietnamese and make little small talk. Anyways Fantasy nails the prices are amazing right now and i hope to god they don't go up in price otherwise I would not return. They did my nails the way i like it (pink n glittery white acrylics) for 32 with gel and coupon in hand.  So the PROS: Decent prices, they talk to you most of the time or at least the guy doing my nails did, oh and Free bottled water!  Let me say one thing before i get into the cons, I had left my debit card on accident at Fed ex Kinko's down the street when i went to print out my money mailer coupon and didn't realize til after my nails were finished drying. :( So the guy thought i was lying about losing my card and stuff so i obviously had to leave my purse when i drove super fast to Wells Fargo to get cash and back. I can understand why any business owner would make me leave something as a collateral but don't treat me as though i am a liar if i have checks and don't look like a total bum or cracked out female don't judge me! It's not like i intentionally left my debit card! geezus! my bf took all my credit cards away from me so   Cons: They do NOT accept checks, when doing my acrylics after drying and all i noticed little spots on the sides of where the white is that there are little triangle shaped areas that should be filled by white and not the pink so i try not to pay attention to the little divots on my nails. I notice everything when i get my nails done because i used to get them done for 3-5 years straight and notice also that under one of my nails it wasn't checked to make sure it was smooth. Since this one nail isn't smooth from the acrylic building up under my nail i tend to play with it and it wont come off unless i went back in which i sort of don't want too now since i feel embarrassed because of my incident yesterday.  **I got a pedi two weekends ago I think and they saved my poor big toes from the pain they were in from wearing certain flats! OH THANK YOU GOD! The fact my nails do not feel like they are in pain i love them so much more now.   *JUST A QUICK NOTE: I LOVE this Establishment & the Customer Service! I was NOT trying to bad mouth them what so ever!!! All I was trying to point out was that YOU should double check (unlike myself) your wallets to make sure you have a debit card or credit card on you when you go (if you don't have cash) because they do NOT take checks! I felt really Embarrassed b/c I forgot my debit card at FEDEX printing out a coupon to go try this place out. GEEZE.  So I would appreciate it if I do not get more offended loyal customers getting all hyped up and pointing their fingers at me like this broad below me who only has 1 single review for one solid location. Which does not make sense because when I go to Pittsburgh Willys YELP always takes down the people who don't have enough reviews So why she isnt getting filtered I do not know.   But Like I said if you want a great deal and great customer service this is the place to come :)

I like albertsons with the self check kiosks.  I hate the fact that not all of them have them like this one for instance. I am not anti social i just feel i get the job done faster on my own since ive had more than 3 years experience in groceries previously.  What i did happen to love though is that once in a blue moon alberstons has an amazing deal and random acts of great customer service like the other day hence the review the service came from a guy that worked in the meat department.  Not every day someone approaches you when you really need help or have questions and do not have to find someone to help you.  Wasn't the case this time. He approached me! AWESOME!

I come here almost every Tuesday as a Ritual for happy hours.   Kona grill has a awesome deal for their mediocre sushi for $3 and mediocre calamari for $4.  They also have a great deal on their sake bombs and their margaritas.Uusually every Tuesday without a question i am DD so i get to think about the quality of the food that is being put in my mouth for $3-4. I have had a lot better in California where i grew up but this is Arizona i do not expect the best sushi what so ever out here.  Which is slightly odd now that i think of it i have had some outstanding calamari in Lyons, Colorado of all places. I have never been a big calamari fan until our usual Tuesday Ritual. Only problem with calamari i have is the parts that look like a baby squid i just cannot force myself to eat it. I always give it to someone around me. So Kona grill... go there for happy hour for their prices! I am sure you are probably wondering as to why I am only giving them two stars out of maybe say 3 or 4.  It comes down to service or lack of.  Now when we started going we had the same bartender for a solid month or two. Then came another female bartender who was also very nice. If the owner is reading this i would love them to come back!!! I have a good friend whom is also a fellow foodie but probably doesn't think about food the same way i do.  Anyways that being said, She Used to come with us and sit at the bar and JUST EAT since 1. i am DD. 2. She is only 20.  So she just orders calamari and water. Nothing too scandalous given the fact that shes sitting at the bar and after 9pm.  Now i understand the rules as to asking for ID when anyone sits at the bar but honestly if they just order food and water i don't see it as a big deal.            Instead one day after months of my friend accompanying me with my boyfriend and friends,  just eating and drinking water we were ambushed practically by a boy scout of a bartender(i understand the rules but this guy is just ridiculous).  All we wanted was some calamari, he then cards my friend who is again 20. He tells us not only is she not allowed to sit at the bar but she is not allowed to sit by the other tables or the patio but the tables that were closed off on the complete other side of the wall because it was after 9pm.  I canceled my order of calamari payed for my boyfriends sake bomb which he had to finish quickly because i was livid and did NOT give him a tip and walked out. I did not give a rats a** that he works mostly off tips if that's the best customer service skills you have; then This Kona grill might have just lost a lot of money until they replace this guy which i hope to god they do because i miss my calamari nights!          What was extremely funny about the situation and why he was given the name "boyscout" is because not only is he like a cop wannabe but he really went and cried to the manager(not literally) that we come in every Tuesday and my friend comes with (underage) and EATS FOOD with me. (booohoooo) The manager then said (about the other bartenders) That is their choice(not to card etc. etc. etc.)(!!).  If i ever step foot again in this establishment on a Tuesday night i will make sure he is not working otherwise i will say it to his face that i refuse to give boyscout's like him my hard earned money.

So after writing my last review on kona, I had got in contact with the district manager by far is extremely helpful and apologetic for the previous incident. I find it helpful when managers apologize for their staff and not the staff thinking they run the show and call all the shots.  I am hoping that when we go on our usual Tuesday's the bartender has been moved to different days but if i happen to run into him again in the future i hope to god he calls for a manager before he tries to offer us a closed dim lit restaurant again for two people of a usual 4+ party.  IT just boggled my mind, because as many times as i have told the story everyone has said "WHAT? when you are at a bar you aren't allowed to sit at the bar but you are allowed to be behind your friend/parent whatever at another table behind or away from within a certain distance."   Anyhow the food is decent and i will definitely be returning for our happy hour Tuesday run as usual.  =]

I hate them. don't shop at sears! Way too over priced their price match policy is bogus, they won't work with you on deals regardless of what it says. Just go to lowes/best buy/walmart/ home depot etc etc! rumors have been said they will not exist after 2011. What does that tell you??  Just an FYI every thing you could possibly call about is outsourced and the delivery team is extremely rude to talk to regardless if you are a customer/employee whatever(don't ask me how i know i just do wont get into it).  Sears may have awesome deals on appliances but i can guarantee that if you go down the street and pay a little bit more elsewhere it will be worth it in the long run as far as manufacturer warranties and customer service with problems and the delivery and installation will be 110% smoother than sears.    Mattresses- do not buy here. I can tell you right now and i kid you not that for your mattress to come in pristine condition and for it to feel amazing is very unlikely because with delivery again its unlikely it will come in PERFECT.  Once i pay off my sears bill i will not be entering any sears and i will never step foot in this particular sears for the rest of my life unless threatened.

I come to this establishment every tuesday...Well at least we try to come every tuesday for their awesome $2 draft beer on their beers and $5 mini pizzas. We also come for our favorite waitress who tends to be there when we are there most of the time. When Sam wasn't working her usual tuesday night shifts we were very upset because she always takes great care of us. Yes i come with multiple people because what fun is it with me myself and i during happy hours.   Anyways my personal favorites are their spinach and artichoke pizza and their southwestern pizza with the chipotle sauce. I am DD every tuesday as well so i have to settle with their ever amazing berry cider brew. Girl Drink? Definitely. But hey im DD...All the time...So keeping it lite and simple woohoo...  =]  One day i will review the darker beers and leave a nice update when i try them which some day i hope to god will and not have to drive after a couple!   Their food is usually pretty good nothing i would spend full price on though. I heard their jambalaya is out of this world which i have yet to try as well. And as soon i try that too i will put all the beers and other foods on my update i just need a better paying job to feel the need to pay for their bigger dishes when its not a happy hour deal.

Just as an FYI to you all they have ended the 2 dollar drafts on Tuesday nights. Apparently it is nation wide and i am extremely upset about this even though i am always DD but still i love their berry cider that is the most amazing cider ever! It just goes hand and hand with their 5 dollar mini pizzas Tuesday nights! but not anymore....  2 dollar drafts please come back!

I've been to this location twice in search for work shirts in specific color and style. Both times I've been beyond disappointed with service. For once I wish I remembered to save my receipt for my first purchase and checked to see if I could do a survey online or phone to voice my opinion on how mad I was when the girl who had just started gve me complete wrong information and the second time the manager I'm assuming who was short and had long black hair had me so confused and just looked at me the whole time like I was stupid. I hope the district managers or something reads the yelp reviews and does something to fix their employees brains somehow and gets some knowledge on their damn products. I've never been to a store of such a higher quality material and left so baffled and astounded by their lack of knowledge. I dare anyone to ask the staff at this location if they have any idea what any products online might be. They will give you that dumbfounded look where they just stand there for minutes where you basically have to tell them never mind ill figure it out on my own like I did. Geezus. Never again will I go to this location unless they get a grip on their stuff.

Here I was thinking for some bizarre reason that their carne asada would be better than morenos or mi casita in chandler and boy was I wrong.  I had come here for (street tacos) carne asada tacos hoping I would find another joyous Mexican place I would be fond of.  Their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of I should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously.  If their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are. I wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids.  I am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time.  The pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware. My spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where I can no longer handle extreme heat like that. I do happen to like their red sauce though  it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite.    Not much to really say besides I wasted a lot of money for two tacos. So overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos. 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy.  I understand you are busy but 30 minutes really?  I doubt ill ever return to this establishment.

Holy Pork!   Yeah I said it. Because there are no cow products or beef here that I have seen.  I love the snack sticks, the only one I did not like were the jalapeno cream cheese, it had a mushy consistency on the inside. The snap when you bite is awesome, but the inside was just off.  Loved the spiceyness just dont care for the cream cheese part. Even though I love cream cheese.  What I do love is the Green chili ones! Those are absolutely amazing.  I also bought some bacon, that was amazing, and still have yet to get my grill working to try out the brats! will update this when I try everything else that I had bought.  :)  So far I am in Love with this place just hate how far it is from me in chandler :(

MEH.  why did my food have to be bland and flavorless. I wish I would have gotten a hamburger instead. It looked so good after i ate half of my bland breakfast burrito with bacon(bacon and eggs you cant go wrong in a tortilla with cheese but THEY DID!).  So i added some salsa to it to see if it would kick it up a notch...Did it work? (oh hell no!) it just felt like it added unnecessary moisture to my burrito. So i had to call the waitress who i only saw for the most part when we first arrived and up until I got my extra hot sauce that was desperately needed severely. The fact I only ate half is bad for a business that means I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I should have. I really really wanted to try their pies because they are supposed to be awesome and home made and I do not mind trying places that are supposed to have good pie because I like to compare and contrast to my own pies.   But what really pissed me off is i had the time to ask her what kind of pie they had and then our waitress went missing did not come back til the guy I am a caregiver for finished all his food and wanted his bill. BUT i easily could have finished a pie ala mode before he finished his food if she came to check on us one time after the hot sauce incident. I was trying to figure out where the hell she was most of the time and I had noticed that she was outside waiting on tables. Why on earth would a manager allow a woman or man wait on a huge area in two different areas?  Huge pet peeve i easily could have given them 4-5 stars if the service was decent that day and they easily were on the right track up til the hot sauce incident. Then the down fall came with such force to make me rate this establishment a 2.    Sad times. So much potential and they blew it.

I dont know how willing i am to come back to this establishment and pay for it next time.  I was taken to a late lunch and we ordered two different appetizers 1 was amazing the other not so much. I expected so much more out of the queso dip that tasted like straight SALT they were really trying to make me sick.  The potato soup with spicy  bacon cheese sour cream and green onions was out of this world! that is why this place gets 4 stars merely for that and their grilled chicken chimi! I was kind of hoping for a side of guac and not sliced avocado pico mix type ordeal.   Queso dip- D- Potato spicy bacon soup- A++ Chimichanga with grilled chicken-B The place itself was pretty dead maybe 3 tables of people full not including ours so a total of about 4-5 tops.  Now that said, A waitress should have all the time in the world to wait on all tables with flying colors making sure everyones drinks are full and what not.  It was not til the end of our dishes and appetizers that she asked if I wanted a refill and i desperately wanted one when i was eating my food and after eating a couple bites of the queso dip I thought i would love but hated.  The guy I am a caregiver for liked her more than I did but you know how lots of older single men are...  I hope to god that this place doesn't get packed because could you imagine a waitress serving more tables than that and having very agitated men and women over drinks she was lucky i am patient.

How do you like your service???  I could tell you how I don't like it...Fake and people to act like they are better than everyone and their S*** don't stink mentality.  And I am positive if the sales reps don't like you and your needs they will run and tell Suzanne behind the curtain & if you listen close I'm sure you can hear them talking s***. So beware!  I should have listened to my Mother who is Cebuano and steered clear of the Igurots as her and my best friends family like to call them.    I will never recommend this place to keep things short and simple unlike the rest of my reviews.

I love this place. :)  the only thing I do NOT love is the fact when I buy things I have learned that you really have to look at things closely and examine very intently, why? because when you go home I can bet at least one thing in your basket molded on the inside like my plums. :( Lots of the strawberries when they have a good deal are mostly molded over also. Does not sound appetizing does it?  The prices here are worth the risk and you get what you pay for.

I know, I know, being a bit harsh if you like them. Unfortunately for me,  I am not crazy into airplanes like some people forgive me.  I was hoping their food would outshine the environment all together.  It is also unfortunate for them that both my boyfriend and myself cook and normally make our food 110% amazing every time (not to brag) when we put our all into it.  With that being said,  We are Huge foodie critics  and don't try to be hard on others it just happens when you cook and bake as much as us.  Sorry, our apologies.  We waited for at least a solid 30-60 minutes for a table standing in the wind, listening to annoying teenagers scream and be stupid like they always are( just being honest), having obnoxious children bump into you and scream and cry all over and not being watched by their parents, oh and my absolute favorite the people who have no sense of personal space.  If you have not caught onto my sarcasm I feel extremely sorry for you.  :)  As we finally got called to our table I chose oh so wrong on place to sit, I wish I would have been thinking more clearly that sitting with my back to the entry was the worst decision I had made for the beginning of my day.  Why? because I had a grandma and her two grandchildren bump into me as I attempted to drink my water in peace, so I had to constantly lean in towards my boyfriend looking at me all strange because he knows how much I Love people i don't know bumping me and getting that close.  We order our food and comes out maybe in 15-20 minutes,  My boyfriend ordered a burrito with hash browns on the side with some amazing salsa(the only thing that tasted absolutely amazing to me)  that had a hair in the hash browns and right under the salsa cup. LOVELY! -(only caps word ill use since I am getting heavily annoyed with reviewers typing LIKE this within EVERY other WORD)  My chicken fried steak was nothing amazing to me only because I have a horrid habit of making it almost every weekend. Like I said Horrid habit!  Then the over easy eggs is another mistake I made because I always forget how I make my version of over easy is not the same as restaurant over easy which means extra runny egg whites and yolks. I love the yolks part but cant get over how runny egg whites tend to be every time I make that silly mistake.  Oh well, Another breakfast place checked off my list and on to the next one!  **FREEDOM OF SPEECH Is the 1st amendment. Please look it up. I have the right to my opinion just like everyone else. Don't harass me just because I wasn't blown away people. Geezus.

So Barrett Jacksons itself  is Awesome....But i am not a fan of how much food is there. Its like going to a theme park or amusement park Ridiculous! Its almost always always ALWAYS expected that the prices are going to be insane. So a word of advice....EAT OUT then go to barrett jacksons after 5 so you only have to pay 10 to get in!  A bunch of nifty things to check out as well besides just the cars. This is one place i do not pay attention to the people working unless its THAT BAD. But it was your average get you in and out service.   One day i will have to go back with cash on hand so i can try the food which to me didn't look appetizing enough for 9.50+

I like Ra only during happy hour because its more affordable then.  I love me some sashimi and Viva Las Vegas rolls, I have yet to try more of the other RA creations but the prices for them are a little ridiculous to me to be completely honest.  I have gone to this location more than twice but not more than a handful of times. I think this past Saturday was another reminder of why I hate going to RA. Regardless of how busy it may be. I would have given the girl a break but it wasn't THAT busy!!  The things I normally ask for with my sushi I did not bother asking because our waitress was too busy gossiping with the hostess' and flirting with the guys sitting a table over.  I haven't had this bad of service in a long time, It makes you really appreciate those that are good at what they do. I cannot expect too much its the Scottsdale location i kind of saw it coming but at the same time the fact that I didn't really want to ask the waitress for the essential things I usually ask for that isn't hard to handle at all is pretty bad. Because I knew in the back of my head that the broad would take a million years to come back because she had to tell her life story to every one on the way.    I am not one to bash a restaurant or business on the regular but it just seems like every where besides ATL wings in chandler I have been not only been getting the worst service ever out with friends but not so great of food either. After this visit I highly doubt I will ever return to any ra location out of my own pure choice, and would most likely frown upon someone having the idea to go unless its for happy hour on sake. That's the only way I would go back and if someone pulled my leg to go.

Four peaks....  I love their spinach artichoke dip more than anything else on the menu. Yes. its a huge portion except majority of it looks like chips and pita bread. i would not mind all of it if the spinach artichoke dip was endless. ;) Now on the other hand i have tried their beer battered bread sandwiches and their popper burger which was not spicy to me what so ever. it was amazing as well do not get me wrong but just wasn't what i was expecting.   Lets get to the beer. the kiltlifter is good but not Amazing. My absolute Favorite beer here of course has to be the seasonal Pumpkin Porter. The oatmeal stout is not bad either i still like guiness better than the oatmeal stout though.  Last but not least the customer service has always been amazing thank god. Only downside is when its a night of a game or weekend it is packed in there. id prefer to go during happy hour before the rush or during the day or as long as i'm not the driver i could really care less i just happen to be impatient and don't want to have to stand 30 minutes to wait for a table to clear up.  Also, I wish i got this younger girls name that is a bartender here because she was absolutely amazing!! Best One i have ever met randomly! As i have been sick for almost 3 months with a weird cough thing going on she offered me hot water and honey since my boyfriend and his friends were drinking. No bartender or waitress has ever done anything like that for me before and when i go back i will update and put this in its own bracket with her name!

I used to love four peaks up until my last visit and my boyfriends visit as of yesterday. We have been loyal customers for the past 3+years and we feel as though they are slowly making their way down the drain.           Let me get into detail here; my last visit the waitress didn't even know she picked up a larger section then she expected so of course we were over looked for a solid 15-25 minutes when  my boyfriend decided to say something to someone. So our waitress came up and apologized LATER with a half ass apology. Excuse my French. We ordered right away, and it took forever to get anything. So my boyfriend decided at the end of our meal and drinks with our friends to pick up everyone's tab since the snooty waitress didn't split the check.    My boyfriends visit tops the cake to where I severely don't want to go back. So my boyfriend had ordered a beer and then came to realize a friends bday was that day so they ordered under 3 shots for the group. After 3 shots they were cut off and they weren't even belligerent, weird. Okay, the thing that pissed me off the most is they accused my boyfriend that he received his pretzel when he sure as hell didn't get it and they charged him for it! Nice!!!! Not. Supposedly they messed up our friends nachos as well. Lastly the waiter was a manager in the end since the first waiter kept messing up, when he cut off my boyfriend and his friends he said even though he has seen us there a lot he had to cut him off because what reason we will never know. But what I can tell you now is that the new staff they have on board isn't the same and makes me not want to go ever again.

You know i was going to give them 2 stars at the very very beginning...Honestly i was. Why only 2 stars you are most likely wondering.  To start off to give you a little idea is that i was born and raised in the bay area for almost 22 years of my life on nothing but the most amazing Asian spots to eat at with the best flavor and all.       Luckily i did find a Thai spot out here in hot dry Arizona which does not happen to be Thai basil obviously.  Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience. Thai basil lacks A LOT of flavor because everything was so watered down.        I asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai.  i was expecting some sort of spiciness given the fact that i had asked for MILD and not  MEDIUM. I shouldn't have to order the hot to get more flavor out of it wouldn't you agree?? something in between spicy and no spice? it would make sense...but thai basil failed that miserably on the flavor aspect and spiciness lots of points missed there.       Now we had got there 5 min after the lunch hour meal deal had ended but we did not want huge dinner portions at the time so we had asked very politely if it was possible if we could order the lunch meal instead. The manager, I'm assuming agreed and brought us out some soup to start. The soup was not bad since we were starving at the moment and i love tofu so okay onward with my review.  Shortly after they had brought out my awaited panang curry which looked to be quite soupy and full of veggies which i do not mind. What matters the most is the consistency and flavor. Which you should have an idea of how the flavor turned out but it gets worse. As i poured some curry over my rice and go to eat a spoonful i am quite used to a spoonful of curry to cover the rice with enough flavor.  This was not the case here. i had to basically pour a whole bowl of curry onto a small tiny cup of rice to get any flavor of curry over my rice. :(        Thai basil had screwed up my friends pad thai and brought out her piping hot plate a couple minutes later hers was not even tinted with any redness we should not need to add more hot sauce when  we asked for mild we expected mild. We were more than happy to get the lunch special than a huge dinner plate because of the fact  that we should not have to pay so much for HORRID(cleaned up word for what i would like to say) food. We were definitely complaining but don't you think  you would also if you were to see a rating of 4 stars out of five on a highly reviewed Thai place?  My other friends pad see ewe? was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland.         The employees were giving us the dirty eye the rest of the time when they realized how much we hated their food. When they brought us to go boxes we didn't need i just told my friends it was pointless to pack the nastiness up when we really wouldn't be eating it later. They agreed and asked for to go cups for our thai tea instead the employee came back and slammed the cups down and walked away continuing to give us dirty looks. TERRIFIC. So freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. and this was 3 reviews in one.           We did NOT leave a tip because the employees were not helpful or considerate since we did not enjoy their food in the slightest. it was not worth my 10 dollars because i ended up having the worst stomach pain for 12 hours straight and bubble guts for probably a good 7-8 hours in the beginning. gross, i know.  I would like to give them another chance but after my 12 hour long incident i really don't want to risk it. I will continue to go to my beloved thai rama when they are open that has to suffice until i go back to the real deal in San Francisco, Milpitas, San Jose or Tracy, CA.

1 Dollar hot dogs and 1 dollar soda and beer?!   Yippee!  We went to watch the sharks game and yes i love the sharks because i am from San Jose.  Duh!  I am slightly disappointed I did not try any food the buffalo wraps apparently didn't have much buffalo sauce and tasted like little dribbles of the red hot sauce so I in no way wanted to eat a nasty wrap that lacked the kick it desperately needed.  How many times do you here that about buffalo wings? Not many.  The dollar hot dogs didn't look the best but you can tell why they are or were a dollar.    If I could bring my own food and desserts and drinks Id be in my own kind of heaven.  But then again you can go to a restaurant out side of the arena get completely full and slightly tipsy so you can really enjoy the game! That's be a Stellar time! Why pay more for mediocre food when you have restaurants outside of the entrance?

I love chase field and I love baseball games if its a team I enjoy watching like the dodgers ( i am a proud dodgers fan) and the giants when they come in to town.  I love the atmosphere I LOVE the kettle corn and I love garlic fries.  I have yet to try the 18in corn dog with all the bacon cheese and jalapenos.  I refuse to eat that by myself because I could see that as practically being deadly in the sense of going into a deep food a coma and or getting severe stomach issues.  I like that if you are in a pinch and don't have much to spend on food there, you can get something off the value menu for a dollar.  What I do NOT like about this place is if you sit in certain areas with a visiting teams esp the dodgers and sit in the wrong section you might be discriminated against and are told supposedly to wear something else or worse.  That is not okay for a business.  The whole point of going to a baseball game is to root for the team you are a fan of. Just because its a Dbacks stadium does not mean you have to wear Dbacks stuff or only like the Dbacks.  Arizona drives me crazy for this reason to damn prideful for no reason.

Holy mother of Jesus....This places eggs and hash and coffee is stellar.  It was crowded for sure on a Saturday which doesn't surprise me.  I wish they had a bigger patio unless they have another area I totally missed by chance.  I like to enjoy my food not so close and compact to other people I don't know it just doesn't comfort me in that sense.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves that type of thing being all close to a million people at once.  Anyways all I have to say to make this short and sweet is Tomato hash/eggs & White chocolate mocha with whip is definitely a new staple until i try the steak.

This is a great hike WHEN you can find parking at the mountain itself.  If not you are completely screwed. Parking here sucks, We drove to camelback as a surprise hike on an empty stomach and an endless amounts of other unfortunates taking place on my birthday at 9 in the morning.  We had to park all the way down at mcdonald and scottsdale rd walk allllllllll the way to the mountain climb it, come back down and walk all the way back to my car (OH YA with NO sunscreen either!!!) So I have the worst tan on myself ever because I had no idea what the plan was for my birthday but im glad my shoulders look nice out of the trip and the hike up the mountain itself was fun but if only I had eaten something prior and had a backpack for water I would not have been so cranky.

My boyfriend loves this place as long as a certain guy is working (I don't know his name) but apparently he makes THE BEST old fashioned or Manhattans or most likely both. They play stuff off of netflix on the TVs usually pretty old movies.  Their jukebox selection is way old school which is nice sometimes when you want to just relax and take it easy.   This is a great place for people who don't want lots of comotion as it usually tends to be quite slow during the week but enough people to obviously keep them in business. I have heard there is a lot more people on fridays and saturdays which would make sense.

It is a LOVE or HATE relationship it is...  Why? because A. either you love it for the deals such as myself. or B. you hate it because you get lost and do not know where to look.  Now i have not stayed long enough I think in my opinion to know exactly every little secret or hidden item but I know enough to get me to what I am looking for and the exit as well.  I know the shortcuts.  I don't come to IKEA for customer service or expect it. What I expect are to find the items I need and to leave shortly after. The only time I recommend IKEA as a trip to look through the showroom is non holiday/ weekday mornings. Why? LESS PEOPLE duh. IKEA requires almost a full day if a part of the time is spent in the showroom picturing bigger items in your home. Who really wants to imagine a room full of rambunctious kids that aren't yours messing up your imaginary dreams? I am not being rude I have a dog that is pretty much my hot headed 2 year old that never shuts up and is prissy as hell but that is all I need for now and do not even like to really imagine what he would look like in IKEA crying on a couch somewhere.  With that being said either come alone or come with your significant other/Boyfriend/Husband/ or Best Friend!  If you know someone that hates IKEA take them on the weekdays like I said they will appreciate it and so will you. A negative nancy is also not fun when you yourself loves IKEA! I am Just sayin!  ooooh also on last note go near the exit and look for the mini cinnamon rolls and pop those bad boys into your microwave! YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED!

This place is absolutely gross. I'm very late in typing this up but what I can remover is the service was so bad that my whole family was joking around on our little get together for dinner that it took so long for them to come around at any time for any reason we could have left our table and no one would have even noticed. They had plenty of people waiting around twiddling their thumbs and the steak my brother and I both ordered was lacking flavor. Times like this make me wish I would have cooked for my family instead since I love cooking and baking and yes I can be a bit harsh on my reviews but I'm honest.   To my family and I included will all agree  that this place was A definite first and last time at this place. When my dad likes a place some what he always always orders dessert. With my review given I am sure you can assume that we did not order dessert.

I stayed here on saturday night since we were going to a show in downtown phoenix and found a great deal on hotels.com and groupon.  We had the junior suite with the double beds and a pull out sofa.  The room was so nice I wish i could have remembered to take pictures to show everyone how quaint it was.  The beds were not that comfortable according to my boyfriend but I didn't have a problem with them.  What I loved most about the room was that you could separate yourself from who ever if need be that is watching TV or hanging out in the first room with the pull out couch.    What REALLY got my attention about the whole stay was the Great Customer Service from the front desk and the fact that there is NO weight restriction when it comes to dogs!!  Now its not exactly my favorite thing to do is to travel with my dog but it has to be done since we do not have a babysitter for him or a place that we feel safe dropping him off at.  Obviously since he is a pitbull mix everyone's eyes go big when I had to take him out to go across the street and relieve himself which is a personal problem since I cant stand ignorant people judging my dog like hes an evil crazy dog when hes exactly the opposite.  Anytime we want to do a stay-cation we will be coming here from now on just need to find a way to get a babysitter for the dog and it would be even more fun then it already was.     The hotel fees come with awesome complimentary items such as soda, ice, candy bars and other snacks.  Now these are not normal things I do not normally eat or drink its just nice to have that option as complimentary.  This is not a crazy gorgeous place to stay like staying at a suite at talking stick or four seasons but its cute quaint and worth the amount we paid for.

We had come here to grab some lunch over the weekend since la grande orange power was down.  I was debating between two things and decided to go with the mac and cheese. I couldn't believe it was soupy. I was hoping it would be baked which is always way better. Such a disappointment  since my mac and cheese on the stove turns out a million times better than what they gave me. Since I happen to be sick i was really thirsty and the waitress took forever after our appetizers came to refill my lemonade.  After she had realized I went through 2 glasses fast she started to get the hint to stick around.  But just b/c of that reason shouldnt keep a waiter or waitress around to see if we needed anything as a courtesy.

For some odd reason i always think that i have made a review at places i have been too over a handful of times including this fine establishment.  I come in here every once in awhile now because i have cut down on baths since i have refused to take a luxurious bath in a bath tub i cannot fully stretch out or be completely submerged in without scrunching my body down in some way.  Once i get a house i will be again addicted to buying plenty of bath melts, bombs, and bubble bars. :) I Still have yet to try their emotibombs shocking enough, but some day i will.  The girls that work here are always nice and have a lot of ideas and information as far as what you might need.   Now as  far as the downsides to the store that i would take caution on is definitely the strong aroma if you cannot handle lots of different highly fragrant scents BEWARE. Lastly the most crucial tip i have that i would watch for is when lush hires new employees for the season and they try and give you samples of something you have NOT used before ASK WHAT IT IS! Do NOT Forget to ASK!  I had once came to this store looking for hair products to see what the big deal was and i had left the store happily with my trichomania and jungle conditioner and a sample of juicy shampoo i think it was called. Something juicy.  But not really so if you have normal to dry hair and i have blonde peek-a-boos by the way to make my hair different. So i need all the moisture i can get.  Got home did not know what i was using lathered all over, rinsed blow dried and straightened my hair it was the most horrid experience ever! It fried my hair in the blonde section completely! I had to go back and stock up on more expensive conditioners and hair masks til this day.  And all they can say is Sorry.  Nice right? Yeah Awesome. So in two months i will not continue to keep my peek a books to see if that helps restore my hair.  Other than that experience and lack of compassion towards what happened i still need to come to this store since its the only one in AZ close by. I think there should be one in the Chandler mall that i work in! Yes i think it would do awesome. :) That way i don't have to spend over an hour to and from.

Ugh gross. Sorry which craft you just don't satisfy my needs when it came to your menu and I doubt I'll be back anytime soon to attempt going for seconds. Upon reading the menu when I saw steak and eggs I most likely drooled picturing it in my head in a sandwich. When my brother and I ordered our 10 dollar sandwich of bliss(so we thought) we ordered it to go so we could eat down by bliss the actual frozen yogurt and crepes and smoothie place with our family. We sat down and opened our sandwiches and were a little stunned by the thin slices of meat and alfalfa sprouts bursting from the sandwich. Few bites in I'm looking for that one bite to just be in delightful heavenly bliss. But no we never got that once. I break out the Tabasco packets in a hurry to see if it will save the sandwich. Sure enough bites forward it does not. What a waste of 10 dollars I could have made a real steak and some eggs for 10 dollars and been more than happy with the results.   Once again another failure in my eyes I will not enter to go for seconds or dare trying others. That was a total crash and burn.

Oh my heavens, can you say D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S???? This place has the most amazing food ever that is home made.  I cannot wait to try more on the menu along with the desserts which im really bummed we did not get to try.  The chicken crepes were out of this world with the honey carrots.  I tried replicating and could not even come close to how good those were. Mouth watering goodness. Make sure if you get fries to get the house ranch they also happen to make from scratch its unbelievable.  If I win the lottery I would eat here every day and not get sick of it!

oh iguana macks....your food isn't awesome and your specials suck now. What happened to you. i live right behind dos and iguana and we used to come all the time for ladies night for the $1 drafts which are no longer in effect. the service is usually below average IMO.  it is rare if we go there now and the last time we went i learned of their no longer awesome deals so i can tell you right now my presence as well as my boyfriends will be even more scarce then we already were. I am a female and will give you my opinion straight forward since i don't have a penis between my legs. And no i am not being a hater or whatever I am just being severely honest so be prepared.    The waitresses are not that cute....Ive seen good looking women and i have seen gorgeous women. They are average. OKAY?  Now food. I think the only thing decent here is the seafood paella even tho it seemed burnt to the skillet. SWEET. :|  The shrimp Po' boy sammich is PATHETIC.  pulled pork....PATHETIC(compared to mine)  i should not have to add more sauces to make it edible.  Mine i could eat it all day without adding extra things to make it mouth watering delicious.  I haven't tried their pies only because i am sure they would fail against my baking in a heart beat of a bite. Baking is my Forte and they would loose miserably...I'm Just Sayin.    So iguana macks....Peace out.

Wow!!! The sirloin sliders were amazing!!! I am in severe shock. Last time we had ate here which was at least a year ago was nothing short of decent as far as food goes. But it seems as though the menu has changed dramatically has shortened in length which I'm okay with. Those sliders with the horse radish sauce onion strings and aus jus were so good that if you think that you dislike horseradish now will bring you into a new light you never saw coming.   I have also tried their jambalaya rolls that are probably tied for 1st place but probably a smidgen below first which is the sirloin sliders of how good these things are as well. And mind you, I had not been drinking heavily to impair my senses and taste buds believe me I'm usually dd on a normal basis and I'm sober probably 90% of the year.   The calamari was pretty good as well but I haven't ordered a basket to myself to see if I could down more than a handful and not get sick of it so still have to wait til I give that more time to sink in. The fish tacos were the only thing I was kinda disgusted by there was a really weird taste goin on and could not tell if it was the vegetables or the fish. One of the two just tasted off and not right. Definitely will not order that again. Kind of the lesson I learn for not sticking to the sliders.   Those sliders are just mouth wateringly delicious to make you want to eat them all the time.

The third time i went to this park recently was a total NIGHTMARE.I am not one of those ignorant dog owners that believe the myth of bully dogs aka Pittbulls. Why you might ask? Oh because i grew up with them and own a mixed pitbull? GASP OH MY GAWD. UGH. I HATE THOSE PEOPLE. Hate is a strong word but when people talk sh*t to my dog and have the audacity to PHYSICALLY KICK MY DOG TO KEEP HIM INSIDE THE PARK BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THEIR SWEET TIME LEAVING MAKES ME WANT TO GO APE SH*T ON YOU LIKE "PITBULLS" GO ON YOUR DOGS (when they are really just playing.) Want to know something totally crazy you stupid ignorant SOBs? :) our pit mix lives with a pug and the pug is not dead!!!!!!  Can YOU believe that?? Crazy right?  So anyways the park was awesome the first two times because of the lack of people and dogs. 2nd to last time was the best. Because there was a boxer owner that had just got him from the pound. My dog did not kill him either. THEY PLAY ROUGH GET OVER IT OR DON'T BRING YOUR WEAK DOG TO THE PARK OR PUT HIM IN THE KIDDIE DOG AREA FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! So they played got their energy out awesome! Time to go home or to the condo so he can get his anxiety back hence the dog park trips that i do not make it to on a weekly basis because of the fact of the ANNNNNOYING dog owners that bring their froo froo dogs that can't hold their own like our pug can when they play fight.  This dog park is huge kinda dirty not much grass but honestly i DONT CARE ABOUT THAT. I care about my dog getting his anxiety out! yes i tend to worry about the water there because its aqua tealish blue. But my dog isn't exactly a water dog. So i am safe. My friend who has a pound pitbull mix (ooga booga!) on the other hand has a water dog i worry about.    If you come during the day be prepared because it won't be very shaded except for the little picnic area table.   So i am completely undecided if i want to go back or not. My friend doesn't get as riled up as i do because her puppy only plays rough with my dog when they are in the backyard together and my dog just takes it and doesn't bite back! Nice park. Horrid people. As usual!

Let me start off by saying I LOVE THIS PLACE  With the reasons why to follow....  1. The Food is Awesome, I have not even got to try the regular menu items yet but mainly just the happy hour rolls as there are plenty to choose from 6 dollars and below.  I love me a good deal and this is definitely that. 6-8 rolls for under 6 dollars is amazing.  The crunch CA rolls philidelphia and spicy tuna for instance are not very big to where you are just thinking GEEZE Insanely good deal...But more like you get what you pay for and it is well worth it.  Once you get up to the 5/6 dollar rolls they get a little bigger. Next time I will have pics to show off the rolls. :)  2.The SERVICE I cannot give enough stars for this. It is a family owned business and the owners are beyond amazing! Extremely considerate and will remember everyone's names the first time if you strike up a conversation.  The first time we went, Maggie let us know about sake tasting night that is once a month for $15 for 5 tickets to try different sakes with a on the house tostada for your arrival.  She let us know of a taxi service that is supposed to be  the owner of this Taxi line(VIP Taxi)  with coupons for using their service.  So the night of Sake tasting night 7/28/2012, we called VIP taxi and had to wait an hour and a half and the dispatcher made up excuses for why the taxi took so long( finding out that the drivers are never really given correct info just an idea of where these people could possibly be) anyways long story short, Maggie ended up giving us a ride home down the street from their restaurant because she felt bad that they werent pronto as she thought they would be since she knows the owner.  That is some GREAT service. I have found 2 businesses that I will be forever loyal too b/c of the owners. If you want good service come here! (or pittsburgh willys for sandwiches/perogies/ milkshakes and hot dogs)   My boyfriend and I agreed that this is the last place that we will be going for sushi from now on. :)

I absolutely love this costco out of the only two i have been to out here in the past 5 years that Ive lived in this state.  I mean honestly the only real reason I love this one more is because it has self scanning devices that you can scan all the stuff yourself and get out more quickly.  I am not a fan of having to wait in line when I usually only get a very few amount of items at a time and its just so convenient that costco is now providing a faster way to get in and out. I am patient to an extent but not when it comes to grocery shopping.

Do NOT get me wrong, I Love Frys marketplace,  However I have never been wowed by any Frys Employees at any location.  MAJORITY of the time i never feel welcomed or i get a feeling as though they hate being there which i do not blame them because i hated working at safeway but i could at LEAST put on a nice fake act so i wouldn't have people reviewing my work ethic on here or on secret shops.  Now i don't shop at this frys on a regular basis because i live in chandler and this is totally out of the way for me.  But i do however work near by as a caregiver and have to make Frequent runs to this particular store.            Now as a former Safeway employee i know how much FUN grocery stores can be on holidays or days before prior.  ;) BUT because of the hectic hustle and bustle of the store and their raving mad customers that is NO EXCUSE to be rude to customers who do not know any better.  For example, When i was a cashier way back when, We could do exchanges/returns at the register itself without having to send people to customer service with  NO PROBLEM.  Unfortunately, This store apparently lacks the attitude i had as a cashier or at least this one older female i would say mid 40's early 50's unless she was in her 30's and looked older with dark brown hair.        If a cashier rips off the survey code on the bottom that is a DEAD give away that they know their attitude was beyond poor(To put it Nicely).  I had bought a couple small items thinking that is what the lady i work for had wanted. BUT she wanted a frozen entree and not all the items to make it from scratch rather. oops. So ran back to the store returned the pasta and sauce for the frozen entree went to the register that did not have as many people thinking it would be similar to safeway, smaller items exchange for one item. No Big Deal.  NOPE. IT WAS A HUGE DEAL(To the old Hag anyways)(once again put Nicely).       This lady was pissed that i did not take these two items to customer service and made a dramatic turn of her whole body to look down and see if customer service was busy which i am sure it was (i didn't look as well because i was in so much shock that she was being this ridiculous. I could understand if it was a large amounts of groceries but it was two items for one GET OVER IT! I swear quality customer service is vanishing before my eyes. I would rather have someone animated and funny with a sense of humor before i get a rude snobby person who does not know what quality service is.  I wish to god i remembered her name and wrote it down but she blacked out her name and ripped the survey code off. Once i see her lovely face again i can tell you right then i will not be polite and something sarcastic will come out and she can bet her sorry behind that I will be having a word with the managers or better yet call customer relations before i speak with the managers face to face.  Survey will be horrid and all just based on her alone though.  I know way to many store managers who do not do anything about their employees behavior and to me that's just pathetic because those employees are the brown nosers.  Enough rambling right? Well Frys Market Place you are an awesome store and pretty to be a frys but you better watch out i am watching you.

So here i was thinking boba tea house was the best boba place in Arizona compared to the best of the best boba in California. Boy was i wrong. The other day i gave the street another try debating between ordering my favorite taro milk tea, the smoothie or a peach mango smoothie with of course...Boba. I ended up ordering the taro smoothie in the end.  The color was like a light lavender purple(not like boba tea house's dark purple milk tea).   I took my first sip and fell in love right away regardless of the fact i have a nearly finished punch card at boba tea house. The boba was so much more rich in flavor and the smoothie was on point beyond belief.  i am always scared to stray away from something i love so much but once in awhile you need to switch it up so you do NOT start hating your favorite drink to begin with. but today i think i still will get my taro smoothie and delicious boba to get my fix.   Oh how i love this place now only if they could get punch cards id be the happiest customer ever or at least happier than i am already ;)

still love this place the most.   But new update on my last visit as a warning to others:   There is a Huge Lady that really has the audacity to tell me that my drink will make me fat. I told her that i don't give a F*** what it does. There should be a sign that says no solicitors. she needs to be standing at a mcdonalds of all places not my favorite boba spot. That's just annoying.  I have NEVER had crunchy boba from this spot in Arizona. yeah it isnt the best boba in the world but its the best of Arizona. you definitely cant beat L.A. or the Bay areas boba to this but until i go back to visit family this will have to suffice. i wouldn't recommend going there bright and early just because that is when they are just making the boba im sure of. in San Jose i would have to wait an hour to get the boba when it was completely ready but the lady was honest with me and i would go to one more class then come back. so take my word for it. i go there at least twice a month if not more and every experience taste wise is on point on AZ standards.

Last night was amazing at this delicious steak house. I strongly advise anyone that wants good steak to come here for the prime rib. Definitely once a year type place because of how expensive it is. Which is why i reduced the star level. Service was definitely good enough. The first lady that approached us at our table wasn't a stellar server but the bus boy or whatever he was was amazing. Letting us know about the steaks wines and potatoes and such. calamari was pretty good too.  The bread and butter were amazing as well. I was very surprised that my prime rib was a lot better then  my Bf's filet Mignon(which tasted a little too salty for my  taste and I had been drinking a little bit since it was my birthday and my BF bought me a bottle of champagne, so that takes a lot for me to say that). I did not necessarily care for my bf's scalloped potatoes that are kind of deep fried with caramelized onions and peppercorn gravy.  The garlic mashed were a million times better with the steaks.  My BF's twin brother ordered the chicken for $25 and said it was no where near as good as the steaks we had all ordered except him so which is why when you go to a steak house you must order a steak. BE PREPARED, They are no where near cheap. The cheapest thing you can order is a glass of beer on tap.  Next to that are the appetizers then chicken then assuming the seared ahi but I had come for the steak! might as well since it was my birthday when we went.  The creme brulee was good but I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it because it definitely was not as amazing as some other I've tasted. I am extremely glad our service wasn't terrible or didn't get any living parasites in  my foods because I cannot tell you how upset I would be not to have a manager that cared about that kind of stuff.  I find it so hard to believe that a manager could possibly act that way as if they didn't care about quality service at what people pay there. That kind of worries me for the next time I would like to dine there again.  I guess its a chance of luck or risk but if their steak was as amazing as it was last night I would not mind taking that chance again.

This is my absolute favorite thai food place in the AZ so far! Their panang curry is to die for! i love how spicy it is even if you dont order the spiciest level. unfortunately the other day i ordered a pad thai noodle luncheon special. Usually everytime we have gone in to eat in the restaraunt the chicken was tender the noodles were seperated and simply amazing, yesterday on the other hand was completely opposite. which reminded me of why i always stick to my favorites and what i know is majority of the time "SAFE" the pad thai's  flavor was on point but it was too hard to get past the fact that the noodles were all stuck together as if they were sitting somewhere for hours. Just like if you leave spaghetti noodles out and not mixed with the sauce. Gross. Anyhow i love my panang curry there because the sauce isn't soupy or too thick. it is perfect and i can never get enough.  Thai rama i will be seeing you the end of this week to get my fix. ;)

I LOVE Chipotles spices they use on their steak and chicken like you cannot believe. What I do not love about this particular establishment is that it seems like every time I go they forget to add a part of my order to the to go bag. It takes me a little while to get here b/c of all the stupid traffic lights from my office off of price and southern.  So it is annoying to get to the office finding out they are forgetting to put someones food that was paid for and having to go back to get it or salad dressing for the salad. Kinda stuff that is crucial.  So annoying.

Wow....is all I seem to be able to say if someone were to ask me about this place.  My boyfriend had brought me here yesterday for my birthday and am so glad he did.  He had ordered a mushroom omelet for me but now knowing that omelets are probably the last thing I would order at a restaurant for breakfast.  I am not a huge fan of them normally but will eat them if I am hungry.  Before the food came out we had ordered a Bloody Mary which was so good.  I had seen a few different ways that people had ordered them with some muddled lemons and limes and was jealous mine didn't come that way to try.  Mine was still amazing don't get me wrong I just wish I would have seen that before ordering one for myself.    When we had received our food we both dug in and was I in shock! I instantly thought when I received my food that I would need a condiment of some sort for my eggs but boy was I wrong. It was so good the way they had prepared them you absolutely don't need anything besides your drinks.  I can't say I will order them again because I definitely would love to try the rest of the menu for sure. But the omelet was solid and a good choice if you Love omelets.  While I was half way through eating my omelet I tried the slices of toast that came with it and was blown away again at just how amazing that was. I also happened to try my boyfriends corn bread that came with his dish and was probably drooling from how delicious that was!  I am slightly nervous the next time I get to order my own meal and for more of their home made bread because I will probably look like an idiot with how in love I am with their homemade breads already.  We had put one last order in for the Johnny Appleseed drink in which was also to die for was definitely a dangerous drink to say the least.  Next time I will definitely have to try the mimosas and peach Bellini's.    Oh St.Francis why do you have to tempt me the way you do and be so far away from our place.

oh how i love this place let me count the ways. to start off i must mention this is no where near as good as my tapioca express and quickly back in the bay area that is for damn sure. yes i do happen to love this place for their almond milk tea, lavendar milk tea, coconut taro, and coconut almond, oh and of course the thai milk tea. yummmmmmy!  being limited to boba place really sucks so this is the best in the east valley that i have been too and i think ive been to every location in the east valley that has boba.  thank god for their punch cards. im just waiting for the day til the accept credit cards under $5. i always have to buy two but when im hungry i dont need that much to fill me up. :)

This is a short and simple trail which is great to bring people too when you want to be able to keep up with them at all times.  I would love to bring my boyfriend to a trail like this because there's no way I cannot keep up with him on this type of a trail.  The trail is very beautiful and not nearly as busy as most trails during the week days.  I would not want to hike this trail on the weekend unless It was very very early in the morning.  The end of the trail is beautiful and serene. Would have been nice to see the waterfall going but it was not ready and the stagnant water definitely attracts a lot of bees so be careful.  There is supposedly cattle roaming but did not see any besides their feces on the ground along the hike. So definitely also watch where you step.  It took us about an hour total not including the time we took to stop and take pictures round trip.  There is also plenty of parking so when someone had wrote that theres limited parking must have severe eye problems.  Because that is the biggest parking lot for a small trail I have ever seen in my whole entire life.

The place itself was interesting and Las Vegas themed through out.   Service was a bit slow sometimes so once again another restaraunt i am not blown away by at all as far as our waiter/waitresses. We had gone with a lot of people for a fantasy football draft party type shin-dig. But you would think if a waiter/waitress has a big party they would want to work it to their best effort by making sure everyone is satisfied.  A lot of people were getting annoyed by the waiter forgetting about their drinks or not coming around often enough.  Lets get to the FOOD: i had ordered a turkey burger "The gobbler" to be somewhat healthy for the night.  It came out piping hot! awesome.  But...The turkey was bland. my mustard, ketchup, and pickle made it better but nothing Rachel ray mouth watering gurgling noises came out of me at all. I was starving so you would think with me being starving that someone definitely would have heard some sort of a mmmm oh my god yumm of some sort. Nope. None.  Tasted like i could have made the same thing for the same price but made 4 burgers instead even though it wasn't stellar.  My boyfriends buffalo chicken tender sandwich looked more mouthwatering than my plate. The fries were decent enough and i happened to steal off his plate when he wasn't looking.  I had ordered the red cabbage cole slaw which was awesome too especially with the french fries! YUM. Those two things together were awesome! Not too many beers on draft. Disappointed with that for sure.  If we go to this location again with friends i will definitely order something else because everyone elses plate looked more amazingly mouthwatering than mine. :(

They burnt the hell out of my toast I was looking forward to eating ever so much! I couldn't believe it! So upsetting. To go to a location specifically for the bread and to have them burn it. :(  I highly doubt I'll be back to this location again if they want to burn peoples toast.

I have been shopping at this specific frys for the last 7 years. Is it my favorite? Definitely not. Will I return after what happened today? Not a chance. Even though it's the most familiar. I refuse to go to a place where I feel like I'm not going to be valued as a customer and not even given the benefit of the doubt about a questionable sale item to them. Whatever scans up is what it is and there's no working with you on price regardless of what the tickets say in the store.   Today I had gone to get a few things including some lemonade and the sale ticket below it said 2/6 for the bigger jug of the simply lemonade. I thought wow what a deal! I grabbed one and did not consider taking a picture thinking this place wouldn't question me about what I had seen if there was a discrepancy. Nope. Rang up as 4.49 and that's all it would be. Normally at some place like Safeway for example..they have someone run to look at the price and then let you know what will happen from there. But based on these people's reactions about what I had asked that's all they were willing to work with. So when I had asked to remove the item that was it he asked if I wanted the smaller jug I said no. I finished up my transaction and went to the back to go check the ticket again and of course the man that had taken the lemonade back had noticed the sales ticket and took it down before I could get a picture. So from here on out I'll take my money elsewhere to shop.

So I have come here a few times now for steak and let me tell you that was much better than the brats I had originally bought on my last review. I like when they have sales on things such as the petite sirloin wrapped in bacon and ribeye in bacon are my ultimate favorites. I absolutely addicted but the price on the ribeye obviously isn't very cheap. I had bought two ribeyes wrapped in bacon and two tiny slivers of grilling steaks(the cheap steak) and a small dog bone for what else my dog... All came out to 32+ dollars. I was like whoa whoa whoa for all that?? Really?? I couldn't believe it because when I bought just two filets wrapped in bacon (the biggest slices) it was 10 dollars! :(  And to me that's an amazing deal for filets!

I love stopping here if i have time before work.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because a few times that I have placed orders to go to bring to work, in which my friend/coworker likes to eat her sunrise with meat sandwich with jelly/jam and they charge you at least 1.25 extra for that mind you, forget to give me that jelly!  So once i get to work thinking they were being efficient as ever, they were not.  Only disappointment I have.  They have the best breakfast sandwiches using their bagels are made for each other especially if you order the cheese bagels in substitution for their onion or whatever else.    They are not my favorite bagel of all time but they are the second in line in Arizona.  They will have my continued business if I am in the area.

I love these brownies they are so good. My favorite ones that I have tried are the cream cheese, chocolate chip, original and my most favorite is the Toffee.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because Im more of a fudgier gooey type brownie rather than one thats kind of like a moist cake.  You would be surprised where you can buy my favorite brownies at for 4 pieces for 2.99-3.99 is Safeway. They are cut up into 4 big pieces and they are absolutely amazing.  Now Fairy Tale brownies are good, don't get me wrong. I just prefer Safeway's shockingly to these that are somewhat over priced IMO.

Oh how I will miss this place. :(  Their last day was the previous Sunday. The manager had always knew what I wanted everytime. She let me know a week before that they were closing since I was a regular. I'm extremely sad to see them go with their amazing lemonade and the prices for the 44oz stadium cup I bought twice. Now I have a stadium cup and no amazing lemonade.

I think tempe marketplace is A-OK. Definitely.  I dont mind dave and busters and i do not mind san felipes as far as a night out. Shopping here is definitely better than west gate for sure.  Love the customer service in Levis and Victorias Secret Sometimes.  Tempe marketplace always has something you can do especially if you are bored.  Reading, Groceries, Movies, Food, Clothes, Yogurt, Tea, Coffee, Alcoholic beverages store, MAKEUP and Hair Stuff?! YES YES AND YES!

Probably the worst Mexican food of all time.  They do have good Cadillac margaritas but that the only reason I would give them a star.  The food was absolutely horrible.  I do not even want to go into detail about why it was so bad.

My grandma lives like 3 blocks away and i had no idea man vs. food had been here i know a lot of places are way too hyped up to be on the show but this one makes perfect sense. I was extremely shockingly surprised.  I did not come in to sit down and get the full on experience but some day i can promise you i will be back again to get the amazing Del ray torta. Like the past review by JT M. I am kind of glad i do not live very close to my grandma otherwise that would make me gain an extra 15-20 lbs at least probably.   Before i ordered i was seriously contemplating all these crazy items together in one sandwich trying to figure out if all these things would be good together. But i took the chance and am pleasantly happy with my decision and so is my boyfriend as well.  He would sneak bites when i brought it over to his friends and was like "theirs a hot dog in here!" i was like weird ya i know. But its all perfect together. I cannot wait to go back to try all the different agua frescas flavors. especially the horchata because that is my personal favorite. All i know at this time is the food is amazing and i cannot wait to go back.

OH MY WORD! :( I am beyond disappointed! I ordered a lot of food for our office and I order the one thing that I love oh so much from Thai Rama (Our usual spot) : Panang Curry! So as i get back and give everyone their food I carefully poured some over my rice took a bite and instantly my mouth was burning when I called in medium not HOT. I had a feeling when I opened the container that the thick layer of chili redness on top seperating from the sauce was a bad sign. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE hot sauce and spicy stuff but not when I can barely get the flavors out and have to keep eating so fast to get past the burning sensation all over.  I love to savor the flavor and let it linger just a little bit more than having a burning sensation to where I cannot feel my mouth or tongue.  So I obviously stopped trying to get past it after 2-3 bites as my manager was laughing at me from across my desk (saying I really shouldn't laugh).  I immediately called Palees back asking if it was possible to switch it our for the non spicy version of it once I got off work they agreed and apologized. Everything should have went smooth right? WRONG. after they agreed to have the new order ready by 5:30 it was not ready, so i sat waiting for 10 minutes and then took it home tried it the following night and guess what... It was just a smidgen less hot than how it was before...:( I still had to eat it fast as possible again.  This was the first and last time I will ever think to go back for anything with a spice level because everything not hot that everyone else got was supposedly delicious but I am almost nervous to even go back what so ever to be perfectly honest. Looks like I will be forever faithful to Thai ramas in Chandler.

I am upping my score by one star just because I do happen to love their food more right now. Their pizza is phenomenal along with a few other things.  I shall try their burgers tonight because its been long enough to where I cant remember how good they might be. I know their turkey burger is amazing but its time for a change tonight. I tried the honey hot wings last time and wasn't impressed unfortunately.  The other night I was feeling totally adventurous and risky! Sooo I tried the burger with the smoked gouda and bbq onions. Which had me confused because for once I cannot recall ever trying BBQ onions in my lifetime.  When they came after maybe 10 minutes later I didn't love the pairing of the gouda and bbq onions and ground bacon together. Now believe me ive had a 50/50 burger with ground beef and ground bacon. San tan does not compare to the original 50/50 in California in any size shape or fashion. It irritates me almost to even think back on how salty the burger was and the pairings with it did not work! AT ALL. i scraped off the onions and ate them with my fries which by the way was superb!  So even though i gave them one extra star its mostly because their food has been hit or miss lately and i really love it when its on point and amazing.

I almost gave them 3 stars. Almost....The sushi is good...Do not get me wrong. Service was average.  I had gone in with two girl friends and we sat at the bar and i ordered the climax rolls to be somewhat different from going with what majority of people get and post about on this lovely review website. They were awesome...But for $14?? NO WAY. I honestly would rather spend 16 for double the amount  of rolls at this sushi spot in Gilbert.  Where its always happy hour and you get free salad, miso soup and a free dessert.  The teriyaki chicken looked good but i was there for sushi thats totally over priced. the only rolls that have a decent price are the vegas and the classic rolls like the spicy tuna etc etc.  Another thing, if you use four square i don't know if its just me and my app but the american express deal does not work or sync. would have been nice if it did. i am not sure if i will go back again just because i am not a fan of going places that overcharge for things you can get just as good elsewhere for half the price.

What people see in this place....is beyond me.  I always feel like I should become a steak connoisseur.  The ambiance of this establishment is on point which is probably the only reason ill give them two stars along with the decent customer service with how big our party was.  Food wise though wont get any besides the lobster bisque that was decent as well.  I had ordered the porterhouse which was overly salted for whatever reason and I love salt but not like a salt lick kind of a taste to my steak.  I almost wish they would have let me season my own steak and cook it myself.  The brussel sprouts were even overly salted I was so bummed because I Love brussel sprouts and I love steak  but both being as salty as they were quickly made me want to stop eating and throw up.  My boyfriends rib eye was so much more tender than my steak I was severely upset with my choice.  He said his was just okay definitely not worth what they priced it at and hated his creamed corn that he took a couple bites and pushed the rest away.    I can tell you right now that this will definitely be the first and last time we would be dining with them for sure.

BLEH. DO NOT GO HERE FOR FOOD!   YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  My coconut almond crusted fish sandwich had no flavors just bland with a crunch! ;)  My boyfriend ordered a burrito and was given something that almost looked like a  burrito minus those little brown spots tortillas get from being cooked. So what wrapped around the stuff? God only knows...   Service sucked too, it took the girl so long to put in our order and then so long to get our check and it wasnt even packed.  :(

In my personal opinion I dislike this place for a few different reasons.   First off it's not an authentic sushi spot, completely Americanized...gross(to me) I like the real sushi spots that use the raw fish just the way I like it. I had to order just a regular tuna roll and sashimi since none of their special rolls had anything that caught my eye. It only seemed like they had crab mix and tempura shrimp as an option. So disappointed.   You cannot do sake bombs the loud and obnoxious way that my boyfriend loves to do them.  You will get stopped by one of the staff members.  Not like I enjoy listening to that stuff as I eat but it's just kinda dumb that you can't if you wanted too.  Scottsdale or should I say SNottsdale....where everyone looks at you like you are crazy if you aren't completely done up. Now if this place was like a whole In the wall sushi place with the type of options I was looking for id give this place 4 possibly 5 stars.  But because their basic tuna roll couldn't even hold together for the prices we paid here I'm just not even surprised at this point. I was just so upset that not one special roll stood out to me.

I love this grocery store even though its pricey.  I love love LOVE the variety. I was kind of surprised though that they did not have a very extensive selection of milk substitutes. I know whole foods has a huge amount of variety I kind of just expected a little bit more than a selection similar to safeways.  Anyhow i ordered a chocolate croissant and I love chocolate croissants. What I Do NOT love on pastries is powdered sugar but i wanted to try it regardless so you can only imagine how much fun I had eating it. It was good...better than wildflowers? Definitely Not...I say this because there is no powdered sugar and no air space in between the croissant and chocolate inside.  One of these days I will try majority of their muffin variety and so far i enjoyed my zucchini muffin immensely.  And i cannot wait to try more from other departments as well.

I Cant believe how poorly they did with my hair when i have at least two friends in cosmetology school who didnt mess up as much as they did. The cut did not look together and just messy and thin and the peekaboo's were no where near even. :| I would not drive out there for anything unless i got a coupon or something but i would not use it for a cut or color.  I would love to see how good they do compared to my friends beauty schools deep hair conditioning treatment because i have tried it at an ulta salon and it did not last  a week.   The girls were nice and did a good job massaging my scalp during the shampoo stage but that is about it.

I give them a 1 star for the penny shots and nothing else.  I never got to try any food here but the gravy fries looked alright. I like more cheese per se but what really caught my attention was the lack of service. We had been sitting with our friends and having a good time. My boyfriend had seen a poster in the mens bathroom for bomb drinks for 4.99 with everything. So my boyfriend had ordered the harlem bomb with his friend and she added on the redbull as an extra for like $3 a piece.   With 6 people or 2 couples at LEAST you would think when the waitress first came up she would ask if we wanted the check split up to save time/frustration/ and confusion. She seriously had the audacity to tell us that we should have told her?! REALLY THOUGH REALLY? What kind of waitress is she?! I understand if the bar is closing and its slowed down but that doesnt mean its okay for you to go run and hide in the back and make out with your boyfriend. My friend walked out of the restroom and saw them eating each others faces. While we had a movie to catch and could not find her anywhere.  So with 20 min before the midnight showing of moneyball she finally brought us our long check that she asked 6 of us to separate on our own because she obviously wasn't smart enough to remember what we got and split it.   We had a hard time with how it was set up on the bill because their computer was having problems. When  we wrote down what we had on backs of receipts and a menu she took the original bill from us when we told her that she charged us for the red bull we could tell she didn't want to get an approval for that by the way she grabbed the bill from us. EXTREME FORCE! AWESOME!  I LOVE when  waitresses gives me attitude. She is lucky I'm patient but she is not lucky that one of our friends was a waitress before and does NOT  take Sh*t from anyone especially from people with extreme attitude.  So she came back again after a good 10 minutes of getting the red bull taken off with one whole check again and slammed it on the table. When my friend had seen this she spoke up and said "YOU NEED TO GET BETTER SERVICE SKILLS" the waitress came back and was like "what did you say to me?!" My friend responded by saying "i know this is a lot of work for you on a slow night but slamming our receipt doesn't solve anything" The waitress kept arguing i am not going to type it all because it topped the worst customer service experience i have ever witnessed and don't understand how the broad has a job as a waitress. We had split up two of the orders by writing down what we had ordered.  So it was self explanatory. she came back again after another 10-15 minutes.  I really wanted to try their food and desserts but after that experience i don't think any of the 6 people including myself will be going back.    I had to leave to go save our tickets for the movie so god only knows if she kept up with her hostile behavior. Most horrid waitress ever. Don't know her name because she never introduced herself kindly to say if we needed anything to call her over. All i know is she was talll dark brown hair and had a piercing on her face i believe a monroe but i am not positive. BEWARE. SHE MIGHT BITE YOUR HEAD OFF! EEK!  i hope the managers read this and i wish i had the time to talk to someone higher up than that night but did not have the time since it took her over 30 minutes to take off red bulls and split up checks. If your business has 2 and a half stars wouldn't that make you want to change something?? Where is the guy from restaurant impossible when you need him to yell at that girl??

I've never wanted to stop eating sushi because the fish tasted weird. I've never ever had that happen until I ate from this place. I picked up food to go and within maybe an hour after eating some of my sushi, sorry to say this but i had serious stomach issues and had to use the bathroom several times if you know what I mean. On the other hand when my boyfriend had gotten home to eat his portion in which I wish to god I would have said you know this sushi tasted off and kind of threw my stomach threw a loop I thought his stomach would be stronger. God was I wrong and I felt so miserable for the next 4 days because he was having throwing up and having diarrhea for a whole day and the diarrhea for the next few days following.   When we get sick from places it makes me never want to step through their doors ever again. And it is severely unfortunate that the two places him and I have gotten this type of reaction is from sushi places in Arizona. I love sushi but at the same time if I have to fly back to my home town In Northern California or go to Huntington Beach i will just so we don't have stomach issues from bad sushi.

Logans roadhouse is a total waste of money. I can make a better steak in the comfort of my home and be in a comfortable not grungy cheap environment like this place.  I always dread when my boyfriends sisters parents choose this place over chilis.  The "high quality" steaks are so rough and disgusting.  I should be a steak connoisseur between my brother and I on how much actual Good steak we have ate since we were young we should be on a show to grade steak.    Short and simple...Do NOT waste your money here.  Unless you like cheap low budget steak this is your place ill spend an extra 20 and a get a real steak at a real Steak house

We love Hanny's!  Their desserts are amazing.  I want to try more but its so hard to stray away from the ones you are familiar with.  My boyfriend loves their pizza and I loved the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  So far we have only tried the chocolate crisp cake and the strawberry long cake but I always expect the long cake to sort of be like a short cake and the whole dessert is so cold so its kind of a shock to me every time I take that first bite.   My boyfriend loves the dirty martinis and the absinthe here.  Oh also check out downstairs for something quite different and not normal.

This has to be one of my favorite restaurants of all time in the American comfort food category.  Regardless of the stupid reservation system for larger parties.  I told my boyfriend about how they have this system now if you would like a reservation you have to pay a deposit to avoid no shows.  It makes sense to me and I personally do not have a problem with it but my boyfriend is crazy particular and does not like that sort of thing.  I still need to go back and try more things off the menu and drinks included.   My next trip will definitely include one Pimms Cup and the Lobster mac and cheese for starters.  Since I have tried the pork tenderloin and was caught onto this restaurant because of this its hard to stray and try other things as your main dish when you cannot fail with their tenderloin.  If i could learn how to cook it the way they do, it would take me awhile to get sick of it.  The whole dish together goes together so perfectly sweet tender and spicy and creamy all in one bite if you take a small piece of meat, slaw and spoon bread it will be a match made in heaven in your mouth.  My boyfriend ordered the cheese curds and the scallops with salad and OMG was that salad delicious I wish I knew how they made that salad so amazing and i kid not; those words NEVER come out of my mouth.  I can only stand salads for so long before I get absolutely sick of it.  so by me telling you they have some kind of salad that puts majority of restaurant salads to shame is saying a lot!  Since we were with a party of 10 and forgot to ask for our checks to be separate the bills ended up getting higher in price not just because of gratuity i feel like.  Since my boyfriend did not pay for it, it ended up being a third of what the total all together was which seemed odd to him.  Personally for how good everything was everything was worth every dollar I spent even if it was well over 100 dollars.    willing to spend 25 on a plate and 10 for a drink?   COME HERE!   YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!  who ever says otherwise are complete and utter idiots....just sayin.

I was debating on how I would rate this place after a year and how everything was this time around. I can tell you right now that I will have some doubt if I choose to come here again. It probably won't be for the food. We went with the current special they have right now for a four course meal to share for 40.  I feel like there was a different chef from the last time we came in for my boyfriends birthday last year exact same date obviously.  Both of us were severely disappointed. We decided to get the potato skins for starters which wasn't anything to brag about. Second was the lobsta Mac and cheese and both my boyfriend and I thought that it didn't taste anywhere the same as last year and it was spicy( I don't mind spice but My boyfriends stomach is sensitive I also prefer baked mac and cheese) for some reason we just thought it was going to be baked and not soupy like velveeta or Kraft. If your into spicy Mac and cheese broccoli type stuff this is for you. 3rd course we had the vovo special which was the beet and spinach raviolis which were good but great? Wouldn't go that far. Lastly was the chocolate pecan pie which was amazing but I totally wish I had a huge glass of milk to go with that. With my boyfriends peach shandy with a shot of pimms he was struggling since he said it was too rich for him. I told him that's what happens when you drink beer and ad a shot of pimms to it so his own fault. I wish I got a glass of lemonade to kind wash down the flavors after each bite.   Everything was good but is it worth $70 including tip. Not at all.  Onto finding a new nice place I can go to for a nice quaint evening that is "phenomenal" every time not just once.  After reading another ladies review on how she was refused to enter with her 1 year old is totally disturbing to me. Since we have a nephew that is almost 1 I look down on places that are that rude. If your child is well behaved you should be allowed to go where you please. It's another thing if they were not. So the fact they have that kind of attitude towards people and children in kicking off a star.

So this is my go to for carne asada and now Sonoran hot dogs except I haven't really tried other places Sonoran dogs so hard to say this will be my staple for them for now. But it definitely is for carne asada tacos for sure. When I think about carne tacos I think of morenos esp on Wednesdays.  The green sauce idk what it is but I love drenching my tacos with the sauce so they are practically drowned. :) so good!

OH MY LORD.....   I have found the most amazing steakhouse ever!!!!! Actually to be completely honest and the technicalities of the story is my boyfriend found it.  How he found out, I probably will never find out anyways.    Back to Thee Food: MIND BLOWING!!!!!!  This place is so good and so worth $40 a plate.  This place makes me want to tell everyone to go for their Birthday so I have a legitimate reason to go soon.  I cannot wait to go back!! the steak is so good I do not need A1 for any slice they put on my plate.  The one thing I did not necessarily care for was the Parmesan crusted pork chop or the bacon wrapped chicken, they were both a little dry for my taste. I was also too absorbed in my delicious steak that I  was too slow to catch the guys running around with the lamb.  Lamb is pretty easy to mess up so you get that gamey type taste in your mouth if you don't marinade it correctly or don't put enough garlic.  So I was interested to see how they made theirs.  You get unlimited sides as well  and bread or whatever those awesome type rolls were. I did not love the mashed potatoes much because I love my own so much more.  The plantains were my favorite and could eat those all day!  The fried polenta was a little weird but not horrible or great. Just Whatever in my opinion.  A definite must go to if you have not been and love meat! You wont be dissapointed!!

I expected soooo much more! I am almost heart broken...Kind of.  The meat lovers scramble was to die for...So why only 2 stars? The amount of food given i could have gotten double at my favorite breakfast spot for the price paid. they scramble maybe like 1 or 2 eggs and throw in some meat but it just did not seem like a reasonable price for how little was on my plate and i paid extra for a slice of french toast. if i would have known that the french toast wasn't as amazing as some people make it to be they do not know mouth watering french toast like i do. If you are craving french toast go to Crackers and Co. Not scramble!  If i go to scramble again i would stick with the toast and potatoes with the scramble but i might try something else next time.  Then update my review. But for now i am sticking with the two stars for the taste of the meat lovers scramble.  I love how many hot sauces they had so it will give me more to experiment with next time.  Their rosemary potatoes are so much better than wildflower bread company whose are way too salty for my taste.    Service was decent even though its not a real sit down place where people constantly check to see how you are doing. So service in general too me wasn't anything out of this world over the top status.  The place itself was clean and comfortable. But not for a long period of time. :) Until then i wasn't so disappointed that i will never go again i am just not fond of how little food you get or think you will get for how much you spend. for $8 you get mostly bread and potatoes. Awesome right?  :|   :\

People who give poor ratings based on their one visit isn't fair. I come here with my boyfriend and his brother on a weekly basis not only because the food is nothing less than amazing; but because the owner is the nicest guy with the best customer service skills which you do not always receive at every establishment you walk into. Randy always makes sure the food is prepared to your liking and a word of caution his food comes out HOT so give it a couple minutes to cool down; otherwise the roof of your mouth will be burnt from not waiting long enough like mine.  Now for the food review, I have tried a good portion of the menu and have Never Ever been disappointed.  From the messy chili dog to the wild willy to the pierogies.  It is always a hard decision every time i go because of the fact that i want to try everything and am pretty close to trying everything.  Its quite sad when people have to give such poor ratings to a place that is run by a local family and the pierogies are homemade just asa fyi to anyone reading this.  Randy, his wife and daughter make them. I always love new things and especially new foods to try. Lots of places are known for one thing or another if you are as adventurous as i am i love trying the other items before the one thing people talk about the most because i find it more interesting that way to see if there is anything else that is just as amazing or better. Gotta love ignorant people. But from a foodie to another this place is awesome for the price you pay. it is definitely worth it. i cannot wait until the bigger store opens up so that it stays open later! So excited!

Randy has his own part of the antique shop to himself for the restaurant now! So it is not cramped or separated you can see everything and everyone within his restaurant and all of his Pittsburgh Steelers stuff. So if you are a Pittsburgh Steelers Fan i recommend this place not only for the food but for you die hard fans that love to be around other die hard fans.  I am personally not a fan of the steelers because I wasn't brought up  a steeler fan but i am  definitely a fan of the Food and how comforting warm and inviting Randy and his staff are.  I have been to plenty of mom and pop type restaurants or shops and I have never felt as welcome as I feel whenever I step foot into Pittsburgh Willy's.    Now more big Big BIG news! They Serve my favorite meal of the day! BREAKFAST!! but i am extremely picky when it comes to breakfast. I ordered a couple of things and still have yet to try everything else on the breakfast menu.  First I ordered the Big Victor, a green chili pork burrito with scrambled eggs and cheese! So here's the thing when i think of a breakfast burrito i think Big, Flavorful and scrambled and wrapped in a tortilla. Now when i took several bites i noticed that all the eggs were to one side,and the meat on another side. I love eggs and all but i need it to be in moderation to my meats and or veggies.  So when i took a bite of egg id have to take a small bite out of other corners for the cheese and meat. Sounds weird but that's just me i don't want to take a massive bite of the whole burrito stuffed in my mouth that's definitely not classy lady like behavior when you eat in front of people. So next time i order i will see if it can be scrambled to avoid the problem at hand for myself. Just like i did when i had difficulties eating the big willy mac and chili. Order it sloppy every time so its easier to eat. Situation Solved!  There is a habanero sauce that definitely gives it a little more kick with not too much bang as long as you do NOT drench the opening with the sauce.    French toast: definitely bread pudding style thick, crisp on the outsides slightly moist in the middle i am currently letting it drench in butter and syrup as i type this to see what impact that has.  When i make french toast or bread pudding i love letting it soak in the custards over night so its almost like eating something that melts in your mouth within seconds.  So after waiting a couple hours the syrup soaked in a little bit making it a little moister in the middle.  I dont care for hot syrup so i poured more syrup on. There is a flavor within the french toast that makes it different from others that is quite yummy. I was so spoiled with crackers and co french toast with its cinnamon roll type innards that randys french toast was something completely different but still good.  I Still have yet to try the scrambles and the biscuits and gravy fresh and when i do i will edit this review and add it in. :)    I

Just a note...I am here on a pretty regular basis and BIG NEWS PEOPLE!  Pittsburgh Willy's NOW SERVES CHICAGO STYLE DOGS! My boyfriend ate his in about 30 seconds. So that tells you something.  If you ever feel the need to change something with an order Randy and his co-workers will be more than willing to serve it up the way you like with no problem!

The specials they have that you can put together on your own is convenient, I love their breakfast burrito deal because you get this huge breakfast burrito with hash browns which I love! But the two together is so Good!!! Also they have amazing milkshakes if you get the strawberry and chocolate together its like having a chocolate covered strawberry in a cup! better to go here than dennys on a late night out.

I have not ventured out to other urgent cares but i have been to this one about 3 or 4 times maybe.  Each time costs me at least $80 just to get in but prices have sky rocketed if you do not have insurance like myself.  Most of the times i have been to this location it was over my thought of having pink eye. BUT i have learned never to go to this location for this reason. Why you might ask? Because the last time i had gone the "doctor" working had told me i did have pink eye and to put drops in my eye for a week.  My eye was not completely closed shut the morning of it was just pinkish even if i put redness drops. So i went home after picking up my bottle from walgreens and hoped to god the pinkness would disappear. Guess what it didn't. So after a weeks worth of drops and some antihistamine drops to follow up my eye had become ridiculous to where i was just thinking WTH did the doctor do by prescribing this stuff?! it is not getting any better?!    So thankfully at the time i had been working at sears(Don't ever work there because they will ruin your life and find any way to fire you and not give you unemployment) and had gone to see the optometrist(Who is awesome!) and said that my eye had been so dryed out from putting the antihistamine drops in my eye that i needed to just put moisturizing drops in from now on.  He had mentioned a ladys son had hit a pole or something hit his eye not hard enough to mess up his vision but scratch the surface and the ER really told him it was pink eye?! Seriously?! When it comes to things with your eyes i honest to god think that Hospitals and Urgent Care should have their own optometrist in the building before they start prescribing things to people and making the problem worse.

Talk about an attitude! The server whom i didn't catch a name from since she stood at our table for a nanosecond and disappeared every time asking us but not giving us a chance to talk  if we did or did not want something.  I am glad the boys only ordered drinks once here, since her attitude was just crazy we decided to leave after they paid for their tabs.

Every time i go to a page that i felt as though i have visited and not written a review after how many times i have been to the location i feel shocked and surprised and all these other mixtures of emotions bursting into my head.   As far as Masa Sushi i couldn't be happier for how much we pay for all the food and free goodies i could care less about the service. it is average. Nothing stellar, nothing horrid. Just AVERAGE. AVG is fine for cheap!  Now if the service was completely horrid like DArcy Mcgees in Tempe marketplace i would not be going back to this location what so ever.  I dont think owners take their employees lack of quality service to heart but it has a huge effect on the customers and how it has such a huge impact on others.  If you tell 5 people that the place was disappointing then those 5 people will tell another 5 people and so forth.  The sushi at this location is stellar for what you pay for it. The squid salad is  quite delicious too.  The sashimi always tastes fresh and i look forward to rainbow sushi every time if we do not order sashimi.   I will edit this review when i get all the names of specific sushis i eat at this location to make this more useful and convenient :)

You are probably wondering how I could go from a 5 star rating to a 1 right???  Let me tell you this visit the night before valentines day  is one that definitely will NOT be forgotten and the one place that we thought we had found a hidden gem with amazing deals and awesome happy hour specials has completely diminished into a place we will NEVER go back too.  I cannot tell you how long my boyfriend moaned and complained about how pissed off he was about the service and how they over charged us for things that we never received/ordered.  I understand these people wanted to go home but this was a decent size table making at least $400 in food and drink orders so we were kind of hoping that our service would be at least average, but since gratuity was already added she probably didn't give a rats A** about how well of a job she was doing to say the least.  With that being said we hoped that something to be on point with service like drinks when we asked for them and not having to ask if we would be receiving them at some point. We also ordered saki bombs and the girl brought out the wrong shot glasses and my boyfriend likes to drop in his bomb doing it the way its supposed to be done.  With the wrong glass and shot glass the beer cup chipped. Not our fault the owner hired a dim wit of a waitress who doesn't pay attention to what people ordered the other girl had to explain what we ordered and how we wanted it(when she wasn't there to take the order to begin with)and it was not that difficult if you take the time to write it down correctly it would make perfect sense.  When we tried to explain to the girl that brought out our sushi that we did not get what we asked for and did not want what they brought us the guy behind the sushi bar was yelling in japanese like it was our fault they cannot understand a simple order. I hope to god that is not the owner because if it was their business will run itself into a hole real fast.  When I come to think of it every time we have gone the service has never ever been stellar. Maybe average-mediocre at most but well? Never. Since we sat inside for once we thought it might have been even better. Boy was i wrong!! absolutely horrible.  The girls were nice but just insanely stupid....to put it as nice as possible.     400 dollar table= we expected a mediocre night as far as service and not be completely over charged. 2 people that ordered 4 saki bombs usually is 15 dollars tops(because of the "amazing" happy hour deals. Yesterday was $28. we ordered 3 different sushi plates...so the most it should have been would be 40-50 with tip not 75! NEVER AGAIN RUINED MY DAMN VALENTINES DAY! UGH!!@!!   I hope the owner reads this and hires people who know how to take an order correctly and don't have argumentative sushi chefs.    WORST NIGHT EVER....I will miss the jalapeno monkey balls but i will not miss the Horrrrrid service. So definitely the worst spot you can go to with more than a couple friends.

I love their pizza here, maybe not my favorite but its the closest to decent out here in lovely Arizona for the price. It reminds my bf and I of round table pizza in California.

I Am NEVER going back to this place.    I wanted to like it with how far we had to drive to meet up with our friends who are regulars to this place. So given the fact that they are regulars I thought the service would be at least decent but it was no where near decent. The Bartender that my boyfriend nicknamed b/c of how pissed off he was with her (and i was completely baffled and taken back by her attitude, i don't know how she is working at a place that has a lot of people coming in and out.). We had arrived and were gonna grab a few beers or two and possibly some food to go along with it.  But when my boyfriend had asked politely if she could do us a favor and possibly change the game from the nebraska and ohio football game to the MLB playoffs(giants and reds) as we are from the bay area originally.  Her first response to a favor was "PROBABLY NOT" WOW!!! Really?!  She stated people were watching the football game but there was nobody around the bar except our friends who were definitely not watching that!!  After that incident we decided to walk across the parking lot to TCs where we had some AMAZING  service unlike Trophys!   NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Worst Bartender of the year goes to that lady.   How our friends from chandler drive alllll the way to this location/establishment is beyond me but it is no where near worth the miles and gas in our opinion.  Bad service makes even food taste bad and given the fact that the rating isnt too impressive makes me dislike this place less. If i could give zero stars I would.

So we had come here initially to meet up with some friends who had left us a lot earlier than i was hoping.  We had gotten to stadium club around 8:35 and wasn't approached by any staff member until 9:06pm. 1st negative of the night because i was hopeful to see how good their food/service was since this place is right down the street from us. :( We placed our orders for food and drink at the same time since we had the time to look at the menu. I was debating between the corona battered fish and chips or the big easy "CAJUN" spiced chicken sandwich.  The waitress said the big easy was popular which i find kind of hard to believe now.  But anyways i had ordered a arnold palmer which is just iced tea and lemonade another thing i wish i never ordered.  You are probably wondering WHY? WHY? WHY? Am i right?  First off the arnold palmer did not get to the table until after i received my food(because the tea was brewing apparently) when i was dying of thirst and extreme hunger. My boyfriend got his large glass of blue moon pretty fast. :( So as i was dehydrating thinking how slow it was going to get the stuff i ordered and out comes our food in like 30 minutes when all we ordered was  a chicken sandwich and a burger. As my side i ordered cole slaw which i yet again also REGRET. It lacked in flavor, and so did my chicken sandwich. It was seasoned with something but i tasted no kick or spice what so ever.  FAIL!!!  I wish i ordered the curly fries (which was my initial first pick) my boyfriend got them so i picked at them every once in awhile as usual.  The arnold palmer didnt even taste amazing. EVERYTHING I ORDERED WAS A EPIC FAIL.  Thankfully when we got our check the lady was fast with that.   So...i don't think i will be back by choice any time soon. Unless i have to drive my boyfriend there to meet up with people all i would get next time are a side of their curly fries if i am hungry.

I was reminded last night of the reason why I strongly dislike westgate late night.  The bartenders pass you by as you are calling their name to get you a glass of water or even an alcoholic beverage and to make matters completely worse had pregnant looking girls with love handles for days shaking their lack of ass on the bar. Ewww. I know it isn't vegas but cmon managers hire somebody who can at least dance and has somewhat of some musical rhythm. I had this urge to get up there and push them off the bar and steal the outfit but why do it if I'm not the one being paid.   As I headed back to our table trying not to step on the endless amounts of dirty napkins that wanted to stick to my pumps last night and took a seat. This annoying females were screaming for no reason. I always run into the worst crowd at westgate for some reason, first some girl wants me to punch her in the throat for stealing my bf''s water and flirting with him and now this girl screaming. Sweet. The bathrooms were a complete disaster and I can tell you right now I highly doubt they have good food with how the ratings are looking already. Good thing my parents always eat at yard house when they drive down so that's hit or miss but probably a million times better than this joint.

I know i should probably eat here a couple more times before i review but whatever i will review anyways and you cannot stop me!  I had a sandwich that used texas toast, ham, pulled pork and bacon! YUMMMM!!!! Now our waitress was very nice but screwed up with my fries. i asked for sweet potato but was debating on just getting the seasoned which she brought out since i got a sandwich that would be bbq'y goodness. so extra sweetness is just not something i love doing on a regular basis because i just feel overwhelmed. i cannot wait to go back so i can try the huge selection of beers. but i did try one which was their for a limited time. was not bad...apparently the wings were good. So until then i hope this helps :)

SERIOUSLY??  Oh yelp how i rely on you to stand up next to what you are claimed to be by the ratings. when i see 4 stars that means it should be more than just okay! Why am i so let down with all of these places? When i saw the word steak burger i was expecting blow my mind out of this world phenomena! Not your average smashed burger wannabe. Don't get me wrong the flavor of the burger alone was decent but not worth $7 for a combo.  I LOVE french fries and these did NOT work for me. There was just a weird aftertaste. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was just weird.   As for the custard...  FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i had ordered a mini vanilla custard concrete with reeses peanut butter cups and i LOVE reeses peanut butter cups you literally have no idea. Next to the original two pack i also love the new mini cups you do not have to unwrap.  ANYWAYS back on track i get this concrete cup with a lid that is good for the car so it doesn't spill.  But the flavor was indeed rich and smooth but the flavor in general just lacked something to me. IDK what kind of peanut butter cups they used but they definitely were not reeses i can tell you that right now.  So dissapointed. If i were to try another concrete it will be strawberry cheesecake for sure. with extra sauce and what not to give it flavor.  But for now i am so mad at myself for spending $10 on BLAH food.

Oh the chai tea oh how I love you sooooo.  The price for the large is a little crazy in my opinion but its still good none the less.  I'm not quite sure when I will visit again because I am heavily disappointed the Hawaiian sea salt caramel is not an option anymore.  So until they get something similar again I will hold off.

my boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch one day but just barely missed the lunch specials. Darn!  i love panang curry with a passion. whenever i am about to eat it or when i am craving it i imagine all the terrific spices that give it a real kick. unfortunately when i smothered my rice with my curry and chicken i took my bite and was just kind of stuck. it tasted as though my curry had been watered down IMMENSELY. based on the fact that i feel as though i got the wrong order or something i am scared to even try anything else. my boyfriend said that the pad thai was good but did not say if it was any better or worse than my favorite spot in arizona  Thai Rama oh how i love that place. but of course not more than my favorite place in tracy, CA.   But this place was just ehhhh for me. never going back.

Good god, after two trips I can say there is maybe two things on the menu if we were to return i would order. One is an appetizer and the other is a side.  The ahi poke salad and the plantain bananas.  Everything else I have tried as far as the bowls go were absolutely gross in my opinion. I couldn't even stomach the ahi bowl and I LOVE ahi! So i pushed aside my bowl not wanting to tell our waiter i was absolutely disgusted with it since i think thats just rude to say that and omg my poor sister who is a vegetarian wasn't very hungry ordered a side of mac and cheese and said it was the WORST mac and cheese she has ever ate.  I would have easily said something to the waiters about her food since shes my baby sister and as skinny as they come i would tell her to stop playing with it and to let me say something but she just picked up maybe a noodle every  5 min and put it back down.  I would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no S**t's were given.  Nice to know hula Nice to know.

I will come back every Saturday and Sunday every once in awhile just to get the lechon not the lechon kawale because my mom makes hers a lot better along with our Turon that has my sisters and my favorite included: langka. Which we found out that theirs does not include it,just sweet banana which was really good it's just kind of a bummer when you know the Turon that we make obviously has it.  I felt bad for my mom since she thought the guy standing in the front could speak any dialect from the Philippines to find out he's from Hawaii, so none of the things she was saying to him in Tagalog went right over his head.  Anyways back to food! ? Pancit palabok-C- Lechon kawale-C Lechon-A++++

I strongly dislike the food here, and there have been a number of occurrences where bartender basically screwed my boyfriend over and what not.  If i had it my way i would not come back to this establishment for the life of me. I am not a horny college kid that is here to stare at girls in shorts and their boobs all night.  They have a decent Thursday night special on drinks but i am over that stage in my life where i want to go out and get wasted and drink til i cannot remember type B.S. I would rather go somewhere get a good deal on better beer and wine and have maybe one or two drinks tops with DELICIOUS food. Not crummy food. How can you have a special going on and have nasty food? I think the reason people give such high scores is for 1. The Girls 2. Their drink specials 3. they are drunk and love the food. Yeah its like all the drunken idiots that love Denny's. Seriously? Denny's? Get out of here with that! "Nobody goes to Denny's, People end up at Denny's"  If it were me drinking like these college kids and looking to go out i would rather drink at home to pre game and save money then  go to the bars. That is just me I am thinking logically at the moment!    As i am looking at the reviews on the right hand side majority of my top 3 ideas as to why people are giving such high ratings and i can bet you one other thing is because they are single and have all the time in the world to come here for that special that isn't as great as it used to be. Anytime my boyfriend brings up the name i cringe and want to stay home.

The owner of this location is amazing and I can tell he cares deeply about his establishment.  This review is only based on the type of customer service I received through email and how quick he was to respond to my question regarding another location.  Given how prompt he was I could tell that coming into this restaurant the staff will have a great environment and no bad vibes at all the way a business should be.  I have yet to try out this location but I most definitely will have to go soon just to see for myself and update my review to add on to this.

Bosa is the only place i will go buy donuts from in Arizona unless someone gives me a taste of someplace better out here(which i doubt). I myself have tried donuts from all the different grocery stores except whole foods/sprouts if they even had any(which i doubt as well). I even used to fry donuts at safeway 2 years ago(not a good idea with how big of a klutz i am and how anal retentive i can be) plus safeway has you do things their way, so if i wanted to be creative it was frowned upon. So i know how tiring it is and annoying and just not fun.  So i totally understand why donut places in general are not always 110% pleasant. If you have whiney customers you aren't gonna have the best service.   Bosa's donuts are even more amazing when they are fresh they kind of remind me of krispy kreme but huge and not as expensive! That is what we call a great deal people!! I am always down for great deals on things! If a place charges 50 cents to swipe your card and you don't like it TOOOOO BADDDDDD! SHUT UP & STOP AT THE BANK BEFORE YOU GO TO ANY BOSA DONUT SHOP!  SO TO ALL OF YOU WHO DON'T LIKE IT THEN YOU AREN'T SUPPORTING THEIR BUSINESS. I am sure that if you own your own restaurant it is not cheap to give people deals on great quality donuts so their will be a catch of some sort. so STOP at the bank before or bring some pocket change from home it isn't that difficult! Honestly. I swear there are too many dumb idiots breathing today with no common sense of grasping the whole picture of things.  Bosa is awesome just bring some change with you!!!   Power to the great businesses and not giving the Beth idiot GREAT customer service (because apparently based on her 8 reviews no place is stellar) because she does not deserve it with her narrow minded mentality and high expectations. just my opinion and i got my right to that 1st amendment just sayin!

I love coming here on Thursdays because of the fresh cheese curds.  My step-dad got me started on them when I was young and the fact I can get them in Arizona is apart of the reason why I am giving them 5 stars.  When they get different flavors and the yellow cheese curds ill be even more excited. For some bizarre reason I have had to turn down the power when I put them through the microwave because it was popping and making weird flashes if it had the microwave on the regular 10 power level.  The customer service here is always absolutely awesome. I always tend to chit chat with the same lady I always see here.  My step dad makes me go pick up the fresh cheese curds Thursday and then bring them up on the weekend to flagstaff for him when I decide to make a trip.  That is how good these are, my step-dad will settle for these since this is the closest cheese curds he can get to Wisconsin curds we are used too.  The cheddar cheese is awesome and so is the fresh milk. So Good!!!

I love me some bosa!  ESPECIALLY when they accept credit cards/debit without charging you extra for using it!! I never minded the cash thing but the only con to this particular bosa in my opinion was the lack of variety. No French cruellers no maple old fashioned no blueberry cake donuts or cherry fritters. So far my top two is the one in Tempe and the one in Chandler because Tempe has the most variety and the Chandler is just the closest to me.   Even though they screwed up my order slightly I love bosa anyways

WOW can you say HEAVEN?   All you can eat amazing food?!  Yes Please!  I wanted to make sure I tried everything I could get my hands on and believe me I tried nearly everything minus a few things here and there. But it gives me an idea of what to expect next time and what not to get. My personal favorite as far as little appetizers would have to be the pork potstickers the endless cocktail shrimp,& half shell oysters.  For main course I love love LOVED the Kobe beef. It was cooked just the way I like it medium rare-ish. The flavor was good but would be even more stellar with some A1. The prime rib lacked flavor but was definitely tender and right in color.  I tried the wild boar Bacon and it was eating like a piece of salty Ham. I'm a little weird when it comes to Bacon because I would rather cook things with it and put it in things than eating it alone as a strip. If you love Bacon for the flavor I recommend this unless you need the crispiness like I do somewhat.   Other things I tried and didn't love as much were the Asian drums in heaven or whatever it was called, the crab wonton wrapped things, the shrimp and mushroom risottto almost tasted like it wasn't finished cooking  & The red chili beef and the shrimp ceviche. As you can tell some things were just hit or miss. But the things I loved I loved with all my heart. So I have a better idea on my plate choices next time.  Let's move on to dessert shall we?  creme brulee was good the texture of the custard reminded me of jello but it was still superb regardless of the jelloy effect :/ The little chocolate crepes were one of my all time favorites,  and a certain cookie to the left on the top shelf that was like eating a crisp sweet wafer were oh so good or like toffee without the effect where it sticks to your teeth! I didn't dip into all the cakes and pies because no restaurant can beat my pies and cheesecakes and cakes. So I passed them up without a doubt along with the little tarts. I Hated the little strawberry shortcake parfait cup. *shivers* gelato here we go.... Prickly pear-different but tasty. Lemon ciello-good but way too much texture for me. I like smooth gelato.  Blood orange-FAVORITE!!!!!! I went on a Sunday before the closed and I know for next time I will go for lunch they way I don't have to pay 27.95. I like the sound of 13.95-20.95 better. :)

So far I'm not exactly impressed. I know that I should give it a few more goes until I write up my review but I just couldn't believe how rude and pushy the men were behind every single bar counter. On my birthday seriously. I could not believe it. My boyfriend had ordered me a drink n walked away because the bartender at the main bar was taking forever to make my drink until he was finished to pay for it for my bday.  The bartender finished and looked over me and asked rudely excuse me do you want a drink? I said that's the rio verde right? My boyfriend ordered that for me and then he asked me for my id and barely looked at it. Then handed it back quickly asking if I wanted to close or leave the tab open, since my boyfriend was the one stuck on his phone not paying attention I decided to close and pay for it since I did not want to be anywhere near that damn bar before I blew a fuse. I've had it with rude people and the second bar guy near the bar close to the kitchen was rude as well when we were trying to leave. Which I refuse to get into because the bartenders were just ungodly rude and I personally don't want to go back but my boyfriend says he will only go back for the drinks since we can make the food so much better than what we tried. We tried the brisket and short ribs sliders and were kind of disgusted in a way because they lacked flavor along with the Mac and cheese muffins since my home made Mac and cheese is amazing.  If I were to return would be some kind of nonsense because my boyfriend would like drinks. I would not enjoy being in the establishment to say the least.

The room was beyond nice in my opinion maybe not for what they charge the regular folk but it helps to know people and we got a great deal so i loved it for the price we paid for a king size bedroom and huge bathroom the tub wasnt as big as i imagined but I loved the concept. If only i were a few inches shorter or the tub was a few inhes bigger.  Perfection right there.  The remotes are a little ridiculous for the TV on the wall but I enjoyed our stay with our amazing bed and prestine bathroom and cheap toilet paper.  :)

I had recently gone here for my boyfriend and my 3 year anniversary. Not exactly romantic with the casino players in the back ground but the food is definitely worth the price and time spent.  The bread is out of this world and so is the gumbo. I cannot wait to try other things on the menu when i decide to go out with friends just for ocean trails. They do not stay open very late weekdays (9pm) but hopefully they stay open later weekends.  Since we only ordered gumbo they give you the option of how spicy you would like it 1-10 5 being moderately spicy(in my opinion it has awesome flavor a little kick not too much heat)(But if you cant do spicy this might be a tad too spicy a 3-4 would be moderate for you but i can do spicier)  I have never tried raw oysters but am willing to try next time and their are definitely cooked oysters in the gumbo along with shrimp and okra from what i remember along with a lot of other things as well along with some amazing dirty rice to mix in with it. So Good!!

This Place is good. Will I come back, sure. Often? Probably not. I have a loyalty to Taiko. Sorry.  The service and food were good here but its a little pricey.  I love when places have a good deal.  I will give them another shot one of these days when I'm down for some all you can eat. As much as I would love to try their signature dishes I feel like I would burn through my wallet real fast.  Their deep fried rolls had something off about the taste not sure if it was the batter or what but it tasted different and not in a good way, but nothing I couldn't handle. Just off.

This place is decent. Just like a one time movie you would want to only spend a dollar on at the Redbox.  One and Done.  I had their teriyaki wings which were pretty good, my friend had the shrimp bites or whatever and said it tasted like frozen Costco food and my boyfriend had the Philly cheese steak looking sandwich which didn't impress him in the slightest because once we left this establishment he said he wasn't feeling it since the time we stepped foot and the waitress that first approached us was leaving but only took my order and my friends not my boyfriends so he was pretty pissed about that and not a good way to welcome him to the place.  Would i drive back to this place for wings? I think not. Will I come for their pazookies again? Yah ill pass on that too. The next waitress we had was nice but not awesome.  She tried to charge me extra for wings when Monday is 50 cent wing day. When i told her of her mistake she said she had to take it off at the register. THANK YOU CAPTAIN OBVIOUS! i am not a dumb 24 year old who doesn't know how to work a computer and unaware of promotions at a job. Our friends were lucky enough to have an awesome bartender literally all day give them quality service and above par expectations. we just did not get either.

I had gone to this location since i was in the area and craving a donut or two based on people had mentioned blueberry cake donuts which are my new fave. But instead of trying just that i had picked out a old fashioned glaze which was literally to die for.  I have never been to the chandler store and eaten a freshly fried donut and had that warm amazingness melt in your mouth sensation unfortunately otherwise i would have remembered the experience.  As i broke apart my donut eating it while driving i was just completely blown away. I am almost scared to go back to chandlers location and not get the same sensation.  Now for the blueberry donut i was more than disappointed hence the 4 stars.   A couple days ago i was in Huntington beach and had went to a donut shop off of beach blvd and experienced i live changing experience by eating their blueberry cake donuts/pumpkin and red velvet(?!) the blueberry was by far my favorite then pumpkin and red velvet coming in last as far as the flavored cake donuts. So bosa failed to impress me with their blueberry which was like a pink color in the middle not really a bluish purple hue like the donuttery in HB.  So i will keep my eyes peeled for when those donuts are rolling out fresh.  OH last but not least don't order boba smoothies at this location they suck and lack in flavor. it just tasted like milk and ice blended together with not sweet boba on the bottom.

Where do i begin...  So i almost almost almost missed the entrance because its like a cute house tucked away towards the back. So that is the first thing when trying to find this place look out for their little stand up ad outside promoting their first time clients Full body wax promo. Second thing to make sure you pay attention to with careful careful precaution. I was fully aware that suddenly slimmer was somehow incorporated with Rio wax salon BUT i had no idea that if you went onto suddenly slimmers website and booked through them would somehow save you an appointment at Rio Wax salon. So if you cancel an appointment through suddenly slimmer and call Rio wax salon and book an appointment you are actually making two appointments. So save yourself the trouble and choose one. :)  I was very lucky enough to squeeze into an opening earlier than what i thought i was scheduled for being there 45 minutes early(to buy the numbing gel) .  I was brought back to the room after a few minutes after applying the numbing gel in the bathroom into a cute room to the left with Kelly who is extremely nice, informative, made me feel at ease and was able to talk too her  the whole time which is always a huge plus in my book.    Lets talk about my first Brazilian wax shall we? Its like a tattoo...well...a couple hour process tattoo in one sitting but squished into 15-30 minutes. It is not that bad until the area starts getting tender from laying there being stripped away at for a couple minuets. I thank god for the numbing gel i don't know how much worse the pain could have been but it was not the worst feeling in my life. Just slightly uncomfortable. Which is expected.  Lastly the pricing. pricing is decent. i would definitely pay 40-45 dollars each time for a professional to do it right and try their best and make me feel at ease every time. i ended up spending way more than i expected but with the membership, the wax service(didn't get my complimentary brow wax) the numbing gel, and some roll on ingrown hair protector alcoholy smelling stuff came out to 154 with tax.  double what i expected and some.   I will definitely be there once the time comes for my next waxing appointment which i will call in advance from now on and not book online.  I hope this helps any of you who have a million questions like i usually have about new places. :)

When I think of this place or anyone so much as mentions the name my face cringes.  If anyone really knows me they know my face will tell you a whole story and some.  I do NOT see why people would want to pay to come in here unless they are a ratchet not fancy broad or a ratchet creeper that likes to ogle the strippers(they basically are they get money stuffed in their panties they just don't take off their tops).  We had gone last night to go meet up with some people and mind you I am 98% of the time if not 99.9% of the time DD(for any of you that don't know that abbreviation I feel very sorry for you, but it means Designated Driver)(Not out of pure choice to be its just what it is for 5 years and a tolerance that has plummeted to its grave);  So since I had to go in which when I know I have to drive there I normally try to find a way out of not going in there per se,  but my spidey senses were not working last night and didn't necessarily think anything crazy would happen but of course like I said, senses were totally off!  4 Fat Ratchet Fancy dancin a** broads (that think they are the S**T as usual) bump into me rudely and fling their fat little sausage fingers in my face and push my chest so they can make their way into the crowd.  Also thinking that I am a push over.  Little do they know I bite(not literally) I just do not stand for that what so ever.  Those days of being a push over are long gone.  I pushed right back ready for whatever was going to happen next.  They all just looked at me like oh wait this B*** doesn't play and I don't.  Getting 4 drinks spilled on me because they want to make a statement to get through is disturbing and NOT fancy.  School of rock should not be allowed to play "FANCY" by iggy azalea anymore because this place is as Ratchet as a club comes.  I hate this place and I do not say that often but I severely do.  OH and big FYI: There is always a cover and that is another mind boggling statement because literally who in there right mind wants to PAY to get into this ratchet mess.

The French toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious! However, I cannot say I am a fan of the monte cristo. French toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs. I love me some good french toast. I figured Id give it a shot. Just not my thing all together. I ate everything separate from one another.  My boyfriend loved his pastrami sandwich he said.  I cannot wait to go and try breakfast!

Honestly for the price i pay every time i walk in to ANY of the five guys establishments i feel like i am being ripped off.   I am not cheap but i am not out to spend 10+ dollars if i don't feel like A. it will fill me up or B. it is too small and average for the price i am paying.  I understand things might be a little more customizable or "fresh" but if you want "fresh" for a Great price just go to in and out or my personal favorite favorite restaurant for burgers/sandwiches is four peaks their food is Good enough for me out here in Arizona. I was born and raised a northern Cali girl so i had it good as far as food goes and i miss it but i have to settle and find what i can out here if i don't end up moving back.    Five guys is cool in my book that you can add stuff but i can add damn near whatever i want at four peaks and i don't feel ripped there.  Every penny is worth it in my book.  Five guys No. Only if there's nothing else close by i haven't tried or if i am too lazy and don't wanna be adventurous and i am starving out of my mind where i just need quick food.  There is another problem with five guys and a reason i don't really go to them often is that there are too many excited people standing in line for this food that isn't mind blowing good for how tiny their burgers are i would rather go to a in and out and pay half the price and be happy with my recent purchase.  Like i said i have lived and traveled all over the world and don't find this place that amazing to wait longer than 10 minutes not including the line just to place your order.   I will pass if i find other places close by which isn't difficult it is not like there's a five guys literally in the middle of the desert with no surrounding places to eat.

My coworker and I come here enough I think by now to type up a solid review. We normally order take out during breakfast hours to eat at work when we are starving and loving everything from this establishment. The prices are crazy reasonable and will come back because of the fact.  It is worth every penny and it's nothing to say wow their food is amazing, but for the price I will come back time and time again.  My coworker and I get the same thing every time. Steak and eggs with has browns for me potatoes for her and I always get the raisin bread and she gets the pancakes. The pancakes are pretty good even if they are cold and have been sitting for a bit. I know that sounds a bit gross but when you work in a high volume place with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch in between it's nice to have little bites every once in awhile as a snack.  Before going to work today we decided to stop and eat there for once since we had a little bit of time.  Everything went fine, fast and smooth and no complaints what so ever.  The staff was beyond pleasant and that's always nice to have eating out.

I have only been to three dmv/adot locations in Arizona. Chandler, Flagstaff and last but not least... mesas delightful location.  :|  I have came to this location maybe 2-3 times and every time I hate it more and more. Why I came here a couple days ago? Because of the distance...Closer for sure or somewhat I guess.  This most recent visit was only to show proof of insurance. Usually I try to wake up an hour and a half to two hours before opening time to beat the DELIGHTFUL line that practically curves around the whole inner building. Nice right? Waiting a solid 30-45 minutes to get to where numbers are given to show proof and they did it right there no number given. I got insanely lucky that I did not have to wait an extra 2 hours or so to wait. Thank god...Never again!

I love this place. Everything we have had so far has been good. From salads to the burger to the crab cake sandwiches Reuben and Mac and cheese and close slaw. I cannot wait til another weekend to try the lobsta roll! And my boyfriend cannot wait to try the buttermilk chicken.  So far so yummy and delicious!  Only thing if I get the burger again I'll probably ask for no Carmelized onions just a tad too sweet for me.

Everything was available even a clear line to the front! The honey butter was sensational and enjoyed immensely. I have kind of fallen out of Einstein's grips because I support local establishments over chains any day.

This is one of my favorite breakfast places of all time.   The strawberry cheesecake french toast is my favorite along with the berry pancakes or french toast both are good.  I tried the corned beef hash skillet and it was okay.    The waiter is hit or miss on service sometimes but the food makes up for it. I just don't like when people try to force me to take food that I did not ask for.  Its like i specifically asked for something why would I want something else???  Oh well. I love their food.

This place is not bad at all. I wouldn't say i am a fan quite yet because I did not get to finish all my food, but one of these days when I'm in the mood I will give it another go.     My manager said her burger was good as far as the toppings but the burger itself was bland and needed flavor even just salt and pepper can go a long way.    I had ordered a country style frittata that was good but was missing something just couldnt put my finger on it, I added my side potatoes to make it a little more flavorful and loved the two together.    One of these days you will get another chance. Some day.

First walking in i was expecting some super hot girls  be in these tiny lil outfits. No i saw a bunch of avg to not so great looking girls with tiny outfits! There was probably 1 maybe 2 girls i saw that looked decent enough to be wearing the outfit where you can't help but stare because her body is amazing! I had come with my bf his twin and 2 of their friends.  Thankfully we got a girl who had a nice body but not so great of a face so it worked out okay. As long as they aren't shaking their tits in my bfs face its  all good. But of course my luck failed me somewhat  because a girl definitely that should not be wearing the outfit with her stomach hanging over her skirt shook my bfs mixed drink in a little jar called "the big red" in his face claiming by our waitress that the girl by my bf is a better "shaker" (obviously with EVERYTHING jiggling) and my bf's friend couldn't help but laugh since he was sitting across from me watching my face as she shook her tits in MY bf's face totally reading my expression out loud after she left the table. Its one thing if i don't come with, but when i am with him don't try no funny business in front of me. I am not insecure people I just do not feel comfortable watching my boyfriend oogle some ugly ass(literally) broad shake her tits 2 inches from his face. Territorial and Jealousy are two different things.   ANYHOW....  FOOD: AWESOME chicken sandwich with the pesto mayo is to die for. cole slaw is okay french fries are stellar and so is the garlic fries apparently.  It is a little pricey but it was a first and last thing for me. I wasn't so thrilled with the place i want to go back for the food and tits in my face thing again as a customer.   Our waitress always came by and even sat at our table sometimes. which i thought was weird but shes 19 so you know...19 your dumb at that age in a way. You may be book smart but nobody invited her to sit at our table like she was our long lost best friend. Excuse me but go back to work we are having a discussion and have to stop our discussion now to make a new one because you have nothing better to do at work obviously (even though you are in a tiny outfit and could be building on your tips at other tables but making me want to give you less).  So thinking about all this that has happened i am only giving them half a star for the food and half a star for the fact the waitress always asked if we needed anything else. But to cut into our discussions i found to be extremely unprofessional and rude in a way. So after that i really can't say that i would want to return to any Tilted Kilt to be quite honest with you unless i was offered a job there. HONESTLY...

This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.  getting the acai bowls for breakfast is a little early for me to eat something that cold.    I could see as a lunch option would be perfect on the weekend when you aren't in a hurry because its definitely worth savoring.    I absolutely love the granola and would take granola and bananas as a topping on these acai bowls any day.  So yummy!

This establishment is perfect for those wanting to get away from the heat or for the people that work in the mall like myself! I work in mattresses at sears so it tends to get slow because not everyone comes to sears for mattresses every day like the flow of people coming in for appliances.  So i have A LOT of time on my hands.  Now that there is a yogurt establishment in the mall i have another place i am excited to go to since My Favorite lemonade place closed down and is covered by a big white wall :'( I love a good number of the flavors at this establishment but they change them out very fast. I cant wait for toasted coconut to come back and cotton candy! Soooo Goood! I go here almost every day but i have not gone in two days so i will have to get my fix today with all their awesome flavors and a huge selection of toppings. Will have pics today on the way!

I love me a great deal.  I got my bangs trimmed and my hair touched up.  The only thing is it will literally take you all day. Bad planning on my part but I needed to get my hair done before I flew out of state for a few days and my mom made last minute plans to meet up for lunch so I did not get to stay there as long as I would have liked to get the deep hair conditioning treatment and so two girls had to hurry and blow dry my hair so I could make it own in time or a little over the time I had said.    The color turned out to look a bit darker than I expected but it was good enough to wear it still looked nice.

My Bf and I had came here on a pretty busy night; we had a feeling no waiter would see us where we had sat but it was probably a few minutes before a waiter had seen us and was very pretty quick getting everything to us in general. Good enough service to where I definitely want to go back soon and try more burgers or maybe just more sweet potato tots since they were the most amazing sweet potato tots i've ever had. Especially with the marshmallow dipping sauce that you do have to ask for.  They have some pretty good specials on weekdays which is why I would like to return soon so I can become more familiar on what days to be a regular. :)  The one thing I did not love too much were the very salty ahi street tacos, they looked perfectly cooked but the flavor killed it for me I Wish they could make mine with no salt or not nearly as much, I felt like I ate a table spoon of salt each bite. :(

As good as the food is here, I severely don't want to come back after my boyfriend and I were starving. We wanted to eat some food to fill our stomachs and the douche bag at the bar said I wasn't allowed to eat anywhere in the restaurant unles I had my ID. I have never been to a restaurant in the whole world that doesn't have a designated area to just eat! At least at like kona grill they will let you in the restaurant if you don't have your ID. So we went all the way home and came back and I was so tempted to sit at the bar and shove my ID in the bartenders face but my boyfriend was so pissed off it wouldn't have been a good idea. So we sat at the tables facing away from the bar to contain out anger from being so hungry.  Idk if I will ever come back after this visit.

I love coming here. I've been there about 4 times I think. I know I'm getting pretty close on my punch card to getting my discount or whatever. The only thing that I was annoyed with on my first visit is  that the price for the detailing job they used to have on their website was a different price in which they told me the other price when I arrived. But other than that they have done a good enough job every time I have been. I wish that they would open up more locations preferably in chandler so I don't get my car as dirty driving home from getting my car washed every time.  I normally get the 8 dollar car wash because I just feel better getting the extra protectants and additives on my car then paying 2 dollars less without it. As far as the yelp check in offer. I have no idea if they honor it because I sometimes hate bringing up the fact I know there is an offer because about 95% of the time people look at me like I'm crazy and then I think why did I even bring it up in the first place I hate being that person. But if the check in is totally worth asking I'll take the weird glare and stupid look over not asking.

The fact this place is never open during the weekend is bizarre for a bakery. Also the fact that I cant even go in before 8 am weekdays is even more bizarre to me! I used to work at safeway bakery and they were workin from 11pm-7pm the next day! So the fact this place is not open before 8am or after 5 is quite bothersome so i will never be able to see if this place is even decent.

When I had come here when it was zen buffet I don't remember it being all this bad.  There were two things that i cared for one particular sushi that seemed deep fried with a delicious sauce and the Mongolian BBQ although my meat was over cooked today.  It was definitely worth 5.88 using the 10% off coupon. I would not want to pay more than that for their food.  Everything that was sitting out besides the lemons and coconut macaroons tasted weird.   The worst was the either the sweet and sour chicken the mustard chicken  i believe or the orange chicken. I just know that all tasted very very strange.

The cucumber lemonade should get 5 stars on their own. I love lemonade and I love cucumbers. Amazingness in my mouth!  We had come for breakfast and now there wasn't much on their breakfast menu it's more of a place to come for obviously wine and bruschetta which is fine but good god I love the cucumber lemonade so much more than any other lemonade I've tried elsewhere next to hot dog on a stick(I know definitely now what you expected me to say right? Lol) anyhow i have yet to try the rest of the stuff here so we will add more next time we go!

OH MY GAWD-  is what comes out of my wings stuffed mouth EVERY TIME I eat the honey habanero wings.  Even though I have only been twice(doesn't seem like enough right?!), Each time I eat these messy little wings of delight(And YES i lick my finger after each wing is devoured),  the experience of the flavor and meat to bone ratio is beyond satisfying.  Last time I tried the mild wings (since My boyfriend cant handle hot wings) they had some good spice but myself personally could go way hotter than that. So I still have yet to try more flavors because I am always so tempted to just get the honey habanero but want to try more flavors at the same time.  The second trip convincing my boyfriend to come with made my wait time for this delicious masterpiece less boring also because we talked to the owner the whole time which I always always ALWAYS love because I believe that owners that have great relationships with their customers make a successful business(+1); like I have said time and time again! When owners lose that bond with customers you lose out on more customer flow In my opinion.  The place has TVs to watch ESPN while you wait(+1) , Two different refrigerators(Coca cola and Pepsi) with the correct products in both(+1)(My stepdad has worked for coca cola my whole life practically so I notice everything that has to do with soda) Kool aid and Sweet Tea(haven't tried yet either shockingly)(+1) and Desserts, specials and Catfish(On steroids says my BF because they are such big pieces) !  On my second trip I ordered 10 honey habanero and 5 sweet and tangy but whatever they put under the honey habanero i am not positive if they were really the sweet and tangy because I didn't taste sweet or tangy, just salt.  I love salty stuff but it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting or loved nearly as much as the honey habanero.  But everyone has different taste obviously.  It doesn't affect my thoughts on how much I Love this place and they got my business and boyfriends and friends business forever and will promote new places such as this every chance I get!!!!  It would be awesome if they could open up a bigger spot like BWW with a bar so they can play the fights I would much rather go there than BWW any day just because the staff is beyond nice compared to any wing spot I have been too and Lolo's in Phoenix and Scottsdale combined.   Update:05/08/2012: A word of caution, if you received a text from atl wings about .50 cent wing tuesdays from 4-9pm make sure you ask about it unlike myself who paid full price not really realizing until i had left and didn't feel like going back asking so late.    The honey biscuits remind me of dense crispy gooey donuts i would have to share them with others because eating all those to myself plus 6 wings i feel like im in a severe food acoma now. delicious and dense.

I'm slightly confused how this place has no reviews.  There's plenty of people during the weekdays and especially on weekends.  There is also no duplicate of this business like plenty of other establishments. I find it stupid how you have to decide between which one to write on when stupid people can't use their eyes on their face to notice that there's another yelp page for that business.    Anyways back to business shall we... This place has been raising it's prices which is a little annoying but they have to make their money somehow right? The nice thing about this place is that they are open 9-9 weekdays and Saturday and til 6 on Sundays. Which is convenient when you live somewhat close and don't feel like making any appointment elsewhere. I have yet to try any other place than this but am meaning to try others when I get free time at some point.  It's hit or miss with how they do your eyebrows and I was pleasantly surprised how good of a job the girl did them tonight. Thank you Jesus for cleaned up eyebrows!

For those of you that have been Bosa-Goers for years its time to step outside of the box and try this place out!  Now I know how difficult for you this might be but I think you will be pleasantly surprised with what is in store for you.  I cannot tell you how much more I love the service here, I have only been twice and haven't felt uncomfortable or unwelcome once.  Not only is it a good deal for mouth watering donuts compared to grocery store donuts I'd pay the extra couple dollars for decadent fried goodness in my mouth then donuts that aren't as amazing as this.  I still need to try the rest of the donuts I got today and more from golden donuts I didn't select today. I wish that we could get samples of donuts that way you know what is going to be your favorite.  I mean bosa and golden donuts are both amazing quality donuts and much better of a deal than krispy kreme is, but one of these days ill have to get the same donuts from Bosa and Golden donuts and try bite for bite to taste the huge difference.    One donut I did notice a difference was the old fashioned tasted like it was made that day and not stale like Bosas can be at times.  Golden donuts needs to start expanding and having drive thru's too!

I am surprised no one has written a review here yet! Kileys Grill was a huge disappointment to say the Least.  After the name and owners changed my boyfriend and I were nervous to return because the food at Kileys was absolutely horrible and took a million years to even get our food on fight nights.  Anyways I had ordered a Calzone with pineapples. Yes, Just pineapples, Don't judge me!  Let me tell you, It was AMAZING.  And when I had checked into Yelp off my phone i received 10% off of our bill.  But the waitress said it might not be able to work and asked her manager/owner.    The owners wife and manager came over and was beyond nice, I absolutely love when business owners are extremely friendly and not scary (like the owner of my job). She gave us the 10% off which i appreciate immensely.   My boyfriend had ordered the bacon burger and was in love with it and ate it all! He was not a fan of the onion rings b/c they seemed just a little soggy for our taste.  Then our friend had ordered the jack daniels wings which were even more amazing! I wish i would have gotten that as well! But next time I go we willl have to definitely order those for sure! Cannot wait to go back and try more stuff.    No desserts  on the menu, If the owner reads this, I make desserts, muffins, pies, cakes, cupcakes, cake pops as my side job and anyone wanting to sell my stuff Id be more than happy to  help ;)

I have been here twice, both times we sat at the bar.  Both times not stupid busy but busy enough.  Our burgers are always amazing and I love that they have so many other options to choose from for people who do not eat burgers and such (like my vegetarian sister)  So if I were to come I could get my burger as usual and they could have all the time in the world to read up on the rest of the menu.  I like the hangover burger the best because I love eggs especially over easy on my burgers.  Kind of a constant staple for me lately.  I have to go and try their shakes and pot brownies still. so once I try more and the desserts I will add more to this review. But if you are looking for a great burger spot in Scottsdale this is my first choice for this city!  As far as service goes, nothing worth raving about but its never horrible. Consistent is the word for their service but not persistent if that makes any sense. So if you need a refill...Speak up.

The food is so good, I have only tried two types of rolls and the sweet chili edamame i believe it was called. There was a deep fried shrimp in some type of batter that was not tempura that was supposed to be amazing as well. Our friend who worked as a chef at RA, Kona Grill, That Place in mesa, and now Pearl Sushi, is amazing at what he does and cannot wait until he puts his twist some day at this location so until then we will continue to come here to support him at this restaurant and use him as a personal sushi chef when we have parties. The food is amazing here and cannot wait to try more.

The sushi is not that great here but they usually have some kind of deals on drinks b/c that is the reason my boyfriends twin goes here besides the fact that they are close to our condo.  But in my opinion i do not care for arrogant people that manage a business that have to flaunt it non stop like they literally own the place.  That kind of attitude really drives me away. The only reason i like coming is b/c my boyfriend likes to spend time with his friends obviously and the drink deals they get with the manager that says he "practically owns it"

Oh Bosa how I love you so. Yes I love donuts oh god do I. I have to urge myself not to want to eat them every day. Just kidding. I really would love to eat donuts every day if they were not so god awfully bad for my teeth and health.  I mean I work a straight work day without eating much I guess it wouldn't be that bad. Its the idea though these donuts are so damn good in my opinion, I still have yet to try any other place that blows them out of the water but until that day Bosa is my savior in the morning when I'm in a rush b/c not only are they decently priced but they have a drive thru! Only problem is that there is always people there waiting in line for these delicious fried dough covered in loads of sugar. I cannot help that I love sweets, and these are too good to stay away from!

I Absolutely love this place and all the selections. Only problem in my case majority of the time is the cider selection is slim.  95% of the times we have been here the females as our waitresses have been awesome with service.  As far as the one male my friend and I had during a Sunday lunch hour was so slow and unhelpful and seemed to not care too much about our table.  The Fries are so good with their buffalo wing sauce.  Their Churchill Grilled cheese is absolutely my new favorite as well. My boyfriend loves the 810 with a fried egg and the chicken legs.  I cant wait to try more on the menu.

Our waitress was super nice which is the reason I am giving them 2 stars basically for the service. The food was nothing worth going back to eat. My omelet was gross but the potatoes were like chopped cubed french fries, decent. They added way too many onions to my omelet I could barely tell If it had bacon in it. I also wish that their menu for breakfast was just a tad bit more lengthy so I had more to choose from since I happen to be on a diet and watching what I eat. They only have potatoes as a side to their breakfast which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Yes it's a country bar/restaurant but c'mon people it's not McDonald's you are a restaurant/bar and you have broccoli as a lunch side can you make your breakfast selection a little calorie conscious. Sheesh.  :/  My Bloody Mary was quite delish I severely wish I got a salad or just some broccoli instead. Such a disappointment.

Who would have thought their food would be absolutely amazing!! I cannot wait to get back and try more on the menu!!!  Let me start off by saying the service was decent nothing stellar, and the food was absolutely terrific. I have never had better mozzarella sticks that had amazing cheese and a light batter. Don't get me started on the dipping sauces because I am just drooling thinking about them. I was kind of bummed when the waitress took them away because I could have definitely used those sauces to dip my French fries in. Not like you really need them with their awesome fries but it would have made it a million times better.   My boyfriend and his coworker got the burgers and they were MASSIVE. I didn't get to try either but they ranted and raved about them(the par 5 and the pastrami) sounded so delish on the menu.  I myself had ordered the burger wrap which was also pretty good and filling I would have liked no onions in it though not really Big on fresh cut onions. Bleh. The meat could have scattered better I think but oh we'll still pretty damn good and glad I tried it.   Believe me when I say this is a must try for all!!

My coworkers and I Love coming to this place to get Hawaiian food! So much better than Onos bbq! The BBQ chicken is to die for! it is so much food for such a great price! Only problem i have with them is they don't deliver and i am 90% of the time the food picker upper. So once they get delivery goin ill be more than happy!!  I cannot force myself to get anything besides the bbq chicken because it is just that good, the luau pork has so much in there i only ate a few bites and was stuffed.  And i have an appetite believe me.  My coworkers tend to get the crispy shrimp and the katsu chicken or teriyaki and love all of the food they ever try besides these as well.   This place does not use MSG to my knowledge otherwise my boyfriend would be throwing up every time we order since he is allergic to MSG.   My coworkers happen to love the crispy shrimp and the bbq short ribs as well along with the potsickers.

I love this place as well. For some reasons my boyfriend and I have fell in love with places in central phx/arcadia area as far as dining out.  We love this place for a number of reasons one being most of the food, secondly because of the manager who always takes care of us in which we forgot his name, and also for the oyster shooters that next door made for us different than most other places.  I love the pretzel bites when the cheese isn't cold or the bread, the fried chicken is amazing and everything else we have tried was just decent. But we still have yet to try more on the menu so until then i'm still giving them 5 stars.

What a disappointment!! I had such high hopes since everyone on yelp wanted to rant and rave about how good the wolf pack was as well as the strawberry rosemary lemonade.  I had come here with my boyfriend who is not a huge breakfast fanatic like myself and I have tried so many places as far as breakfast goes.  My favorite is still Crackers and Co by far.    So as my boyfriend made all the faces known to man looking at everything I was pretty set on what I was about to order.  As I thought about ordering the wolfpack I was tempted to order the half order of the carmelized banana french toast; but saw other peoples plates and the size of the wolfpack sort of forgetting about they had the wolfpack club opted out of getting the french toast(bad idea, b/c the wolfpack was a lot smaller obviously) .  In my opinion the wolfpack and the woldfpack club is COMPLETELY overpriced. I can make the club for about 11 dollars spent at the grocery store and serve up 12 dishes of it.  I know restaurants tend to be overpriced especially this once since guy fieri has been to the main location.  As our food was on its way my boyfriend b****ed and moaned about how gross both the lemonades we had ordered were(rosemary and mint) and i couldn't agree more.  Then came to realize that there was an alcoholic beverage menu which he then decided to complain how he didn't see it and wish he saw it first. Our waiter had said he doesn't drink and IMO probably why he decided not to tell us about the menu to start off with.  My boyfriend is irish and can definitely drink like a fish; Every drink he had ordered that was SUPPOSED to contain alcohol he said it did not taste like there was an ounce of alcohol in it.  As our food had arrived, I noticed that the wolf pack would disappear within a matter of 5-10 minutes, and had wished that I ordered the french toast half order.  My boyfriend order the chiliquiles and looked like nachos with 2 over easy eggs on top. definitely glad I didn't order that for breakfast.  Some of my boyfriends toast was burnt so i ate the burnt slices for him to scrape my plate with.  Today's total for our food and drinks was not what I expected to spend for 25 dollars a person.  If I would have knew we were going to spend that much I would have waited til sunday and went to wandering horse buffet for all you can eat for 5 dollars more a plate. Or waited for dinner and went to fogo de chao for all you can eat brazilian steak and such.  What a waste.   When I go back with my friends, I will be ordering the half order of carmelized french toast and steak. Now that sounds like a winner compared to my breakfast today.

I had gone a second time to give their caramelized banana french toast a chance to makeup for last times visit.  As you can see by my rating. The french toast was good but something that i wouldn't say is caramelized for beginners and then I can easily make this stuff at home for half the price. My friend had ordered the reeeses pancakes and said it taste like a normal pancakes with hints of reeses bites  every couple of bites.  Think this will have been my final visit.

Did you say $5 don Julio shots?????  $4 margaritas????? You can bet your *** that anytime you come here you will hear this. To me that is music to my ears! Why? Oh because I LOVE tequila. Just no gold tequila unless it's in a margarita that's okay.   Now if you are already feeling it from prior drinks elsewhere and are looking to eat this is a place to come when you have friends with you to sit upstairs and take it easy and knock some more drinks back.  Because during the time you wait depending on your waitress you might have to wait a bit you might not. Now when my friend and I went on Friday we weren't concerned really on how long it took between things until we wanted to pay for our tab. Apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well. We easily could have ditched our tab in which my friend was saying we should do but since it was Friday the 13th I felt like we would get bad juju for something like that. So we had to search high and low for this waitress of ours and told another waitress we needed to leave right now and had to get our waitress then she came running. When you are working multiple tables on multiple levels I don't expect prompt service on a Friday night just a good place to come for drinks really because the Mac and cheese burrito is okay at best. Nothing spectacular just better drunk food then filibertos nonsense!

Now I love my burgers and LOVE having an option to decide how I would like it cooked. If im not given an option I am already bummed out by that time when they go straight to the amount you owe or what toppings you would like instead.  Its not that I wont eat a burger like the ones here because obviously they are good.  But getting burgers that are smashed and thin and such is just depressing to me. Its like going to an upscale mcdonalds. I am all about deals and here for the price you pay I would rather go down the street to grab a full size burger medium rare with a over easy egg on top. Now thats my cup of tea per se.  My boyfriend loves this place and i enjoy it as well. Its just not on the top of my list at first to go to... its more of like oh...okay. sure...whatever. Its good but not my favorite at all.

I am very disappointed in myself for not reviewing this sooner. So forgive me and I will try to do my best to tell you everything I have tried if not the whole menu. ^_^  From most favorite to least I will make a list of everything starting with Favorite first and with a short description on why I like it. -Poutine: So full of cheesy goodness and meat and fries?!  such an amazing combo and the cheese is melted so perfectly it makes me drool thinking about it. -Mussels:I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend ordered this because the mussels I am used to looking at are much bigger in size.  These were little guys that reminded me of clams but in a butter sauce and with a side of sliced toasted bread which is delicious. Ahi-I love raw fish more than a lot of things, if I could eat sashimi every day I think id be in heaven. But this was much different, more of like a poki ahi salad stacked nicely with a great tasting sauce. Crab Dip-amazing as well, I love cheese and dips together. So delicious. Just try it! -Deep fried banana split- no need for a description its just good! -piece of cake- also good no comment needed! -Spent Grain cookie- different not my favorite but good also -Grilled sausage platter- too much potatoes for my personal taste but the sausages with the potatoes were good together. -North mountain malt-was like a shake, pretty good! -Pizza- this one was kind of our fault,  my boyfriend and I like to watch diners drive ins and dives and shows similar.  We watched andrew zimmern in MN add a over easy egg to a pizza when it was almost done cooking so it could ooze over the pizza.  Sounds delicious.  No one out here understands how to do that here at all when we try to explain it.  So what we got was like a breakfast scrambled egg pizza with lettuce on it since we ordered the Cesar. Gross.

Yes 5 Stars! It is as good as it gets and I am not just saying that to be bias because I love locally owned mom and pop type shops the most.  I do love the service a million times more than chained restaurant businesses. I especially love when the locally owned businesses are severely welcoming and happy to see customers coming through the doors.    Lets get on with the review shall we: Chicken pot pie- A- Blueberry- A+ (esp when you go home to heat it up and put some ice cream over it!)  I cannot wait to try some of my boyfriends green hatch chili pork and his lemon cream hand pie.  When I was younger I was in love with the little hostess or safeway pies that are glazed with chocolate pudding or apple fillings so I cannot wait to try the rest of the hand pies from this establishment in a few days. So Good!  It can be tricky to find if you aren't around the area but if you know where house of egg roll is, it is tucked away in the corner in the back.   The service here obviously gets a A++++ :) So go ahead run down there and grab a bite its totally worth your time and money!

One Star for the food.    Service=ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRIBLE I KID YOU NOT!  I am sorry but when the first time i go in to place a to go order for our office and it takes them over an hour to process our order and get it to us and only offer us "NICE WATER"(??????) I just thought to myself thats all you could do was offer us water??? It would be one thing if we were there to sit down and eat and had no time crunch to get food.  We are used to getting huge orders from taquitos jaliscos in like 30 min or less.  I didnt get any kind of apologies or anything from the managers walking around. Can we say unprofessional?    So our second visit my BIRTHDAY.  We had a waitress with so much attitude she could make a room feel tense.  I will never return to this place after the stupid B****es wanted to eye down my mom like we had to be rushed out the door to leave just because the waitress' shift was over with. To top it off they didn't do anything like bring a dessert for my bday or anything. Not like that's the reason for my visit all I want is good food a decent enough service. If you can't provide both or 1.5 of those things bring me a dessert NAO!  I will stick to going to the phoenix location from now on.  Tempe location I hope you go out of business because of the horrendous service. It makes me so disgusted.

I would totally give just the burgers and beer 5 stars easily, but more times than not the service is a little off in my opinion especially go figure on wednesdays when the amazing deal is happening.  It almost makes you wonder...If I come any other day then on a wednesday will the service be mediocre???? Will it? I would not know I have yet to go any other day of the week and the trend will have to stop so I can see what change we will encounter my brother and I since I can't ever speak my mind when my boyfriend is around since hes the charming one to anyone regardless of the service. A waitress could be totally avoiding me completely and flirt with him and not ask me if I would like one thing and he would not see anything wrong with it(True story...Really Happened)  On to the glorious BURGERS.  My NUMBER ONE place in Arizona for Burgers so far. All I have to say is that these Burgers are Absolutely Fantastic and I am very upset I have not gone lately.   YOU must go now. That's an Order....Seriously right now!

Still by far my favorite burger spot hands down.  But be warned, make sure you check your tab before you leave. My boyfriend and I had come in with a couple of our close friends to show them how truly amazing these burgers are.  3 of us had ordered the special burger of the night "da bears" which I wish they would keep on the menu. But anyways when we all had ordered the beer that you could get without getting charged extr (they have little peppermint patties) next to them I feel like is a waste of ink on their menus since the waitress charged us full price for the beers and just subtracted 3 dollars from each when we did not order the other beers on purpose because we wanted the 12-14 dollar deal that comes with a burger and beer for the above listed price that you are told won't change if you get the appropriate (peppermint patty dotted) beers.   With that being said I'm not sure how often my boyfriend and I will be back since we are not a huge fan of places changing their prices and not being a good deal. I guess good things can never last right?

The salted caramel ice cream tasted amazing i liked it a lot.  Did i absolutely fall to my knees from the inner joy it might have brought  me, ehhh...not quite.  The only con I have is I am personally more of a custard/cold stone fan rather than reg ice cream.  The consistency was so liquidy and not creamy as others I have tried but my brother and i enjoyed our ice cream for sure.  Just a personal preference thing for sure.

I have a horrid horrid addiction to doughnuts it's so bad that one of these days I'm sure I will say I have tried every doughnut shop in the valley as well as phoenix included. Some day. Now I have tried a pretty decent amount of bosa's I should say and have always enjoyed them mostly the one on Arizona and ray since it's the closest. Everyone I've seen talks about how bad the service is but it's a doughnut shop and I've fried doughnuts for safeway before and second of all most of these places are owned by Cambodians (one of my friends is Cambodian and spoke to them in her dialect) or some other type of Asians. I'm half Asian and believe me when I say that Asians are not always the most friendliest so I give all doughnut places that slack because I know what worse looks like.  But what I have noticed is that good doughnuts not only has very good doughnuts with no weird after taste and exceptional customer service so it gets 5 stars from me.  I'm a total sucker for sprinkled doughnuts, old fashioned glazed, and maple bars top 3 right there and this place along with the blueberry cake are my absolute favorite and always nice that this place is on my way to work with a drive thru!! Even better! Have yet to try their Thai tea or smoothies but I'm sure they are fine or ordinary will update when i try them!

Having only been to this specific location twice I can tell you that every time never disappointed me in the slightest.  This past time we had gone around between breakfast and lunch in which I was never really aware that breakfast was an option at The Vig since we normally come past dinner time or after hours I should say.  So being a person that is absolutely in LOVE with breakfast/Brunch my mind automatically said we are definitely getting breakfast!  I ordered the Corn beef hash with poached eggs, I was not expecting it to look the way it did but OMG was it the best thing next to steak and eggs? Pretty damn close! My mom had ordered the deconstructed fish tacos and was loving that because she ate it like a salad in a way and was completely satisfied which is a plus since shes just as picky as I can be.  My brother ordered the BBQ Hot Vings and also liked those I tried one and wanted another but stopped myself from asking since thats all he had ordered.  If i were to choose between arcadias location and this one this one is winning.

Okay okay okay I think two times is enough for me to gather a decent amount of things to say about this amazing establishment.  I have never felt more welcome in a nail salon (except for one my old coworker owns in chandler mall) to where I want to return to not only because of the warm vibes I get but from the amazing work that Tiffany and the rest of her family have done on both mine and my friends nails that I brought with me.  The first day I only had time to get my gel nail manicure done and they turned out better than I had hoped. Especially 250% better than the last place I wrote a review on in gilbert.  The second day I had wanted to get a pedicure since they have a check In offer (which I hate asking about because you never know what to expect if a business will look at you like you're completely insane or be accepting and understand what is going on) and Tiffany already knew I had checked in so I would get my 10% off of the service. I cannot wait to try their best pedicure package because I literally was ready to doze off when I was getting my feet massaged. Some places focus more on the legs and for me personally I'm not a fan of my tibia being roughly massaged on like I've had in the past. The last pedicure I had at sky nails almost made me want to never get a pedicure again. I've never been in so much pain getting a pedicure before.  Thank you Jesus for marvel nails I will never stray! It is absolutely the worst trying to find the perfect nail salon but I will search no further and don't have to go to multiple places for different services.  It's so much nicer if you can trust a place to do a good job on both massaging your feet and knowing how to do your nails correctly.  I cannot wait for my 2-3 week marker when I can get my next pedicure it shall be epic I am sure. Then I will have to drag my boyfriend in as well so he can experience the magic! :)

I come here for the beer/wine and mostly the burgers.  If we aren't up for driving...we come here for burgers.  They have such an awesome smoked flavor to their burgers (dont forget to ask for their homemade bbq sauce to dip it in!)  I have tried their shrimp salad as well and the shrimp had that gross fishy taste I am not a fan of but hey I gave some of their menu a chance and the only thing worth getting at this point besides the drink are the burgers and the wings. Enough said.  Definitely a must try.

Definitely never stopping here for anything ever again... Sticking to the actual location for sure.  The service is probably one of the slowest waits for our food and drinks ever.  What kills me is when the man was saying "its made fresh" in regards to the wait time is why it was taking forever.  I believe that to be the biggest crock of S**t coming out of someones mouth coming from an airport establishment.  The Italian beer bread was NOT fresh.  The bread didn't even look right or taste right at that.  So not only was I irritated by the wait time with the word "FRESH" thrown one time after another (in which became a family joke from here on out is that its "FRESH") but i was severely disappointed on top of it with our food.

Do I love this place? ummm..sure..kinda... Do I like it. definitely.  As you can see I'm a little indecisive at the moment about if I love this place.   What I love is their filet mignon pho for sure!  Please no tendons or any of that chewy stuff I cannot handle texture for the life of me!! Reminds me of octopus.  Cannot Handle That!  *cringing as I type*  I tried the noodle Banh Cuon and was extremely mad at myself for not being safe and ordering the amazing pho in which I don't even know if they carry the filet mignon anymore.  I will be bummed if they stopped carrying it.  The Banh Cuon taste wise was fine just nothing much going on really.  The reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I felt like the service was a bit lacking even when it was dead slow at night for us when we were the only ones in there at the next 30 minutes and the Banh Cuon felt like I was gonna chip a tooth and be cautious because of the stuff they put in the middle or inside who knows?!    The fact I had to be that cautious with my food over nerves is annoying.  I always want to try new stuff is that so much to ask for and not be nervous to eat! What the heck!  As long as they still have the filet I will be a continuous loyal customer.

This place is quite pricey but they are good ill give them that for sure.  I am not necessarily a fan of going to Mexican places in Arizona because no one is ever as good as the "lower quality" restaurants in California.  Those restaurants back home are where the real food is because you can order anything off the menu and its good. Enough of California..Isabelas is good it is worth trying..But i can't say its worth a second trip.

Oh the Flavors!!! I am absolutely in love with this place from just one visit.  How my boyfriend didn't enjoy his pad thai is beyond me.  I loved my sisters tofu pad thai i felt like it had so much more of like a sauce on it compared to most placed being all dry and gross.  Not this place unless the chicken is that much different.  I cannot wait to go back and get more of their pad thai.  From the looks of the pictures the panang is pretty soupy looking. So that i am definitely steering clear of because according to my best friend we like when it is cooked incorrectly like at thai ramas where its more of a thick curry that coats your rice rather than drowns it if that makes any sense.  My mom had ordered a seafood curry dish of some sort that tasted amazing as well. So this is definitely the best thai food spot for pad thai and certain dishes cant wait to try more off the menu!

A second location owned by randy! Customer service and good food will always always Always get 5 stars from me. If I can feel completely welcome and at ease and enjoy the food at a establishment it is easy for me to give 5 stars. It is so hard to come by amazing customer service this day and age with so many negative waiters/waitresses/bartenders that I've seen in my lifetime.  I am so fortunate to have yet another place where I can go to and feel like everything will go just fine customer service wise and enjoy my food all in one trip. Randy will always greet you or his family helping out as you come through the door with open arms. If I can give more than 5 stars for that feeling I endure id give so much more.   On to the food we go!  I ordered just  something simple a classic burger with bacon, cheese, and of course the lettuce and tomatoes(hold the onions!!) and don't forget the side of cole slaw! My boyfriend on the other hand went the opposite route slightly and got a chili burger can't remember the name :( but good god was it delicious. I found myself after maybe 75% through with my burger to be slowing down to consume more but at the same time I couldn't help but to cut the remaining of my burger in smaller bite-size pieces and dip them into my boyfriends chili and consume burger and his chili combined. What a glorious glorious match. If you know Randy's chili like I do and his new burgers it's a match made in heaven!  Also let me just say as UN-American as I happen to be(growing up mostly with Filipinos) there happens to be plenty of American things I do not enjoy like cold sandwiches, potato salad, baked beans, etc etc etc. With that said, Randy's daughter introduced a sample of his baked beans that the spiced up to me regardless of my lack of interest in  baked beans in which I'm so happy she did. Now if I could get that sample size every time that would be perfect with my burger and chili I can definitely do since their baked beans are the only kind I can stomach and enjoy. I just can't do as much as most other people.   With the glass soda products coming to this establishment as well makes this even more exciting since I love the glass bottle taste compared to the plastic bottles and aluminum cans.   Oh randy you have done it again!  Cannot wait to see the new Pittsburgh Willys  when it opens up!

Well.... Another Thai place that I won't go to again.  They have the same prices almost as most Thai spots.  So no positives or negatives because of that.  I had ordered the panang curry kind of knowing that the consistency of the curry wouldn't be the way I like it (which is actually the wrong way)  and the chicken Pad Thai. The chicken Pad Thai tasted really weird to my boyfriend and I.  As far as the taste of the panang curry, it was okay nothing stellar.  Oh and there was no chicken in it maybe like 3 slivers.  And plenty of onions and green and red peppers.   Gotta love when places totally jip you on the protein.  Might as well order tofu since they probably wouldn't skimp on that.  Such a disappointment.

The fact they have pudding as an option besides tapioca gets 5 stars from me.  You are probably wondering why would I give a business 5 stars for pudding???  If you are from the bay area you and enjoy pudding as an option for your drink besides tapioca and have lived out here long enough to know the struggle of not finding one decent tapioca having cafe that has pudding.  Until Now!!!!   That only took 5 years for Arizona to catch up to California's status.   Thank you jesus for this place I can live a little easier now until we move back!

Service is pretty horrendous if I might say so myself.  The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review.   Definitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender.  But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar.  The sliders were not really pleasant  and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely.  Will I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up.  If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar.  Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if  I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water.    When i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself.  I literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout.  *threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone. Not to me. When you come to a restaurant you would hope for consistent service not once at the beginning. That's like getting seated at a restaurant and not getting any service afterwards. I love how people want to say that I am wrong and not making a factual speculation. Good god people. ***update it is currently 8/31/14 and no one from management has obviously reading these reviews which is a shame. Lack of concern on their part id say.***

Looking for a great hair stylist you can rely on to make you hair look like the sh**? Look no further. Come here! You will never ever be disappointed. Joncen always knows what to do with my hair when it's in desperate need of some TLC.  When it comes to color he is absolutely the best. My boyfriend has never ever said one thing to me about not liking my hair.  It was not until i went on a small hiatus and had someone touch up my hair and my boyfriend hated it that I took a break from coloring my hair all together and decided to come back because I know that I can trust Joncen with my hair at any given time.   Check out his portfolio he is probably the most creative hair colorist I've ever met. If my job would allow me to do something crazy with my hair I would run to Joncen  in a heart beat. Now that you have read how much I love Joncen call him and make an appointment and be ready for a life changing experience with someone who knows what they are doing. :)

So first off let me say that I am absolutely 110% excited that they opened a second location over by my condo and was so excited to get my butt in there to see how they do compared to the original location.  Unfortunately I was craving them the other night and decided to get take out to bring home. So they got my food ready quick and I could have swore the salmon combo was supposed to come with 5-6 pieces of sashimi. Mine came with 3 not that big of a deal really so its okay.  The only thing that bummed me out to the extreme was that when I had already gotten home and was all over diving into my food then the unthinkable happened!!  NO WASABI OR GINGER!!!!  Both of those two things are extremely crucial in my sushi binging.  I cannot tell you how upset I was last night going home to realize I did not have the essentials to eat my sushi.  Im upset even just thinking of it last night.  Its not like wasabi and ginger are readily available at the grocery store to buy in bulk.  So I would have to go out of my way to go all the way back to get wasabi and ginger when normally it's included. That is my only pet peeve at the moment. And hoping that it won't happen again and I'm hoping to god the one waitress from the other location didn't follow because it's very annoying having someone constantly asking if you need anything or if you are done etc etc.  Update! *5/9/2014 All week I've been craving more salmon-sashimi and rolls all together non stop. Finally Friday comes along and it's sushi after work for sure! I call it in to pick it up and this time saying extra wasabi and ginger. They give me the right amount of sashimi finally and everything looked amazing! Couldn't wait this time to go crazy! I ordered the same thing again obviously except this time with you know the ginger and wasabi they didn't give me last time. They gave me so much wasabi I wasn't expecting and not so much ginger. I'd rather have them skimp on wasabi over ginger. But that's just me! Once I start going in they will remember for sure.  I absolutely love ginger with my sushi.  The salmon tasted fresh and I ate a lot of it in less than probably 30 minutes to an hour it was so good!

This is a great workout! Definitely not what I expected at all.  My friend made it seem like a stroll in the park until you got to the top but I definitely felt the burn once were done from this one hell of an inclined trail from the start. Seems like a longer trail than most trails ive been on in the valley.  Definitely have to get here early like before 7 am to miss all the traffic like any other trail but its definitely not as busy as camelback which is definitely nice.   So if you are looking for a different view of the valley and a great workout this is definitely a great trail.

My boyfriend and I love checking out breweries.  We both have a love for good food.  With both of those things being said the beer here is great.  My boyfriend recommended it to his friend that lives down the street.  My boyfriend was not thrilled with the fact that he had to order a whole two entrees to get full.  He ordered the carnitas plate first thinking it would have the portions like four peaks for some bizarre reason.  I ordered the pub burger because I like to play it safe.  Does not take me a whole lot to get full but its just...safe.  It was okay.  I love butter lettuce with all my heart and eggs but there was just something missing and cannot put my finger on it...maybe BBQ sauce?  My boyfriend then ordered the TBLT or whatever next and I can always read his face better than anyone when it comes to food since I normally cook dinner on a regular basis.  It was not the normal loving face he can make when he in absolute bliss from food alone.  Now we loved the beer don't get me wrong. We will be back. But Food might not be in our cards the next time.

I am always always always down to try new burger spots. I love burgers that I can order how done I want my burger and being as particular as I can be I like having my red meat medium rare. So when they ask you medium well I feel like I had an absolute blank stare as if there weren't an option I asked if there was anyway I could have it medium rare. He agreed out the first burger down for take out and when I got to the second burger he asked about medium well for this I had the same stare but even more confused since I just said medium rare I was like um.. No medium rare again please.  I ordered the tex whatever burger that turned out to be a disappointment only as far as the toppings go. The burger itself was fantastic so much potential this is what I get for being a risk taker. :( I thought there would have been some kind of heat to this. Not even a slight hint of some heat from the "jalapeño sauce" just EXTREME saltiness. I love when you have the hint of salt not an over abundance of it to where I was scraping off bacon bits and then all of a sudden eating just the patty and still scraping off bacon!  I can't believe I had to even do that!   I really hope to god my boyfriends bbq bacon burger is amazing compared to mine otherwise I will feel very badly for coming here to get this for him when he gets home from work.    ***so I decided to go again with one of my good friends and try this place out sitting there and being able to enjoy my fries and burger at the establishment itself this time. This time I opted for the Thai shrimp "burger". Whoever says this burger is bland is absolutely full of it! This "burger" was my favorite I think I'll only be sticking to this from now on with fries with a side of their amazing chipotle mayo and the rajun Cajun sauce.  Both the sweet potato and the regular fries were good but the sauce rwly makes it. A word of advice as well. The marshmallow sauce was not good and the apple cider sauce was decent along with the Thai ketchup.

So I totally made the dumbest mistake by coming to this location thinking this was still golden donuts not even reading the sign at 5:45 this morning and still dark out. I came here because I thought it was golden donuts and could get 6 free donuts for buying a dozen. Thankfully the guy behind the counter was not a jerk like most donut shop owners and didn't tell me until I was paying that this was rainbow donuts and not golden donuts I was in complete shock and totally embarrassed that I didn't even look or think about it. The guy still gave me the free 6 donuts and am totally grateful. Always good to know there are still some kind people in this world.   As far as the taste goes everything tasted on point from what I tried. But the real test on which I didn't get to try yet is their cake donuts (I did try old fashioned and those were awesome) so I'll definitely be back to try the regular cake donuts and the buttermilk ones as as well.

OH WOW  I haven't written about this place yet?? CRAZY!  Let me just say first and foremost. Their Cakes are Delicious/Decadent Rich and Moist and Packing Flavor!!! (depending on which flavors i should say though)  For example my personal favorites would have to be their white white chocolate, Red velvet being my ultimate favorite, and their seasonal  flavors in the fall.  Do not go anywhere else for red velvet. Every time i crave it and don't feel like baking it myself i just run to this same location and buy a little personal bundt size for about $3-4 or so.  It is addicting, I have tried red velvet from other bakeries such as Frys, Bashas, Safeway etc etc and no one nearly comes close.  As far as service go its hit or miss, I am in and out fast so i don't take time to really pay attention to their attitude but its never bad enough for me to knock them for it this time.  But that's doing a lot to get me to that point. You can read my other reviews for places that have severely poor service in the east valley and its pretty minimal i would say.   Price wise for larger cakes is a little steep and i say this because if i wanted to replicate the cakes i can do it if i really wanted too its way too easy for me.  I have never bought a size larger than the personal size just because they are asking for way to much when i can make the same cake if not better for half the price. ;]

I love hot dogs and now I happen to love Chicago dogs(haven't tried them until portillos opened). I also got to try a few bites of my boyfriends italian beef sandwich but he didn't get the peppers at all so now I have to make a separate trip to try it with the peppers soon.  I'm obsessed with the jumbo dogs and also have to try it charred just to see how that is (even though I'm not a crazy fan about burnt food.). The french fries were decent nothing that made me want to run for the hills and scream about it.  Between the jumbo Chicago hot dog and the italian beef I think that has me hooked enough. Still need to try more on the menu since it's pretty lengthy.  Last night I got the chocolate cake shake and good god that's the first time I haven't been able to finish a small shake. Way too sweet for me. Definitely something that's a one and done type of thing for sure. It's definitely got all the frosting and such in the shake and the texture threw me off a bit since it's not smooth. :( not my kind of thing. Weird for me to say just too much going on in that shake for me.

Out of all the movie theaters i think i have been too in Arizona this is in the bottom three. Why you might ask? Well here let me tell you!  1. Teenagers- Summer time is the absolute WORST. All the yelling annoying kids that dress up like they are going to the club and scream at every possible moment during times you don't scream. If you cannot handle the heat stay outta the kitchen stay home with your mommy! (#1 reason i wait til movies come out so i can just rent it for a dollar) 2. My boyfriend lost his wallet and his student id so he only has his library card from ASU and they always give him a hard time about that and how it needs a face on it and a actual student id.  I know they are just doing their jobs but i am sorry my boyfriends wallet was stolen give me a break! 3. Overall Environment: it is okay not the best but its okay i don't feel at ease at this location as i do some others.    Tip: it is kind of a far drive down but thursdays at ultra star they charge 5.75 for tickets! and 3 dollars extra for 3-D! Definitely a nicer theater than Chandler Harkins!

I don't know how I have this place two stars 2 years ago when they clearly should have been a 1 star the whole time.  A lot of you reading my reviews like to harass me for being "harsh" or whatever the F u want to call it. I'm my Personal opinion I call it being honest and blunt. Which I am at all times you can bet your a** anytime any day I will tell you how it is whether you like it or not.  Now let me just say I hate this specific movie theater and only come here because it's closer than others but I'm refusing at this point to come here to watch any movie we have been waiting to see for some time since my boyfriend and I don't normally make it out as much as we used too.    Why do I hate this movie theater again?  ******TEENAGERS********* I do not miss that stage in my life what so ever.  Annoying as hell and only have gotten worse especially out here in Arizona. I'm sorry but moving out here 5 years ago has brought me to realize how ignorant/racist/stupid/overly prideful arizonians are out here and it's really sickening. I would never raise my children in this state because of the type if people I've seen at this movie theater and it sums it up each and every time mostly during the summer.  Kids constantly kick your chair out here thinking I can be a rude twat waffle and kick this lady's chair and she can't do anything about it because my parents have all the money in the world and I can get away with murder.  That's the type of kids I see at this mall and theater every single time. It's awesome. NOT. (I'm totally rolling my eyes probably every other paragraph thinking of all the times I've been here)  At least in Northern California you have parents and people who have respect for people and the decency to stop their misbehaved children from ever acting like the idiots we have out here. Just sayin.  Like I said this theater blows and will always suck because of all the little teens running around wild in this place. And too many to where if you did complain would be hundreds more waiting to kick the hell out of your chair, yell in your ears, laugh way too much so you can't hear a damn thing or spill food and drinks all over you and not apologize for it either.  How do you like to watch your movies? Maybe not in complete and utter piece but I can tell you I would rather listen to my dog cry like he always does in movies in my ear over all the above listed things at this movie theater. That's for damn sure!  *awaits hate mail for being honest**  X_x
