Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders.

This restaurant is in an industrial neighborhood. My motivation to come here Are the throng of Chinese who frequent this restaurant. The dimsum selection is slightly better than what I've had in the other three dimsum restaurants in Phoenix.

Excellent space to relax, reflect, read, talk. As chip as it gets. Excellent coffee and specialty coffee. The service is relaxed but shows fantastic attention to detail. Hats off to the baristas.  The pastry options are numerous and delectable.   Wifi works pretty well while you lounge in the varied spaces and listen to the music, occasionally manned by a DJ.

This is as close as you go to Tito's tacos. The meat is quite tasty as are the tortillas. This is not traditional Mexican street tacos but more if Tex-Mex variety. The salsa is tangy and has a mild kick. Options are tacos, "burros," enchiladas chimichangas and red beed or green tamales.  All are solid but the crunchy tacos are my favorite.  Service is pretty fast and the restaurant is almost always busy. That is a good sign. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy as it is the strip mall that the restaurant is in

Corena is a magician when it comes to preparing catering orders!  We last ordered for a birthday party a few months ago.  I just didn't make time to logon to yelp to finish the review. The options are tasty, compliment one another, and keep our guests, young and old happy.  I highly recommend Carrabba's grilled salmon.  All the pasta dishes I have had have been excellent as well.  The catering staff's supervision is what makes the food just as presentable at home..

Not fancy nor do they have an extensive selection. In fact they are just a few chairs and tables in the back of an Indian market. But what they make they make well. I specially like their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Their tandoori chicken is served on a bed of onions and is not as interesting. As well he just doesn't stay warm. They serve absolutely delicious gulabjamoon (a syrupy doughball dessert) and have a decent Indian chai.  Hot Naan is included

Great ambiance and decor did not trump the mediocre salad I would expect from Domino's pizza, paltry veggies below an average salmon,  and plain, grocery store quality cheesecake.  I was part of a group.meeting. We were served off a fixed menu. I am just dumfounded why they would compromise on their supposed imaginative offerings.

Their chicken pita is as good as their gyros! Lean, tender chicken, well seasoned, cooked just right!  Huge portion.

The service and a burgers are both awesome. My family and I have been to this bar 3 times and have always been blown away by the quality of our burgers.  The burgers have a home made feel and great flavor.     Our server has been very kind to our kids and that is another reason we have been going back.  We also did a to go order that was just perfectly packaged.

We have quickly become fans. We ordered in the restaurant and have ordered takeout twice so far. I love the quality of the Persian rice and the kabobs. I also like how conveniently the meals are packaged. We are planning to order individual meals and appetizers for a function. I am also looking to break from the habit of only ordering kabobs to try traditional dizin.

Solid and plentiful Pho, as good as you'll find in Arizona. The fried egg rolls were crispy and delicious, served with just the right amount of lettuce and picked veggies. The restaurant itself is quite spacious, the fixtures are very neat and clean,, over all the setting is much more respectable than your average Vietnamese place.
