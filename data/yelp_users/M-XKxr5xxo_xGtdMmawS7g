I am not a picky person.  No really!  I'm not, but I had such a horrible experience here I had to share.  I made reservations for tonight at 5pm since I was told yesterday when I called about going in that night they couldn't accommodate me, and I needed to come in the next night.... But whatever.  I found the whole thing odd when I came in tonight and they did not have my reservation, and then laughed at me and said it was probably on a scratch piece of paper in the office.  Awesome.  I would comment on the service, but other than taking my order, it was pretty much non-existent.  Oh wait, they did stop by 30 minutes after taking my order to drop off some burnt bread and to tell me they were having "printer issues" and my appetizer would be out soon.  I'm not sure what kind of Jetson's kitchen has a printer that makes my food, but again, whatever.  I waited tables in college, so I know that's code for "I forgot to put in your order".  15 minutes after that, my appetizer came out.  In my world, 45 minutes to wait for your appetizer is pretty bad.  And I'm not exaggerating.  It really took that long.    Since I was pretty hungry at that point, the appetizer disappeared quickly.  I honestly probably would have liked it if it hadn't marinated in my bitterness for 30+ minutes, but I wasn't impressed.  I looked at my watch when that was polished off and it took another 30 minutes from that point for the entrees to come out.    Now, really, any entree at that point was pretty much doomed.  Its hard to like anything when your irritated, however, for $19 a pop, I was not pleased with the quality of my entree.  If it's going to take you over an hour to cook it, it better have some freaking pizzazz!  Again, I am quite confident that it didn't take them that long, and they just forgot about me.  I get that, but i have been many places where the way they handle the screw up is so impressive, I come back for customer service alone.  That is not the case here.  Please tell me your sorry, comp something, bring me some wine... Something!!!   And like I said, the food never even stood a chance....  Needless to say, I will never be back.

I love this gym.  The best thing about it is that it's not a "pretty people parade" type gym.  Don't get me wrong, there are many attractive people who work out here, but I don't ever feel bad going here since I am not a 22 year old with a perky tooshie.  Its a gym for all people of all fitness levels.  My kids adore all the staff in the child care center.  They are always doing something fun and get excited every time we go to the gym.  I've taken several different group classes and I've enjoyed all the instructors.  Keri Z is my favorite.  Her yoga classes are awesome!  I've been a member for over 2 years and still have nothing I've ever complained about.

I am not a vegan.  I am not a vegetarian.  But man, oh man, if I could eat here every day I just might be.  I don't care if you go meatless or not, the food here is on point.  It's also great to eat something tantalizing to your taste buds and also not feel like a fatty patty when you leave.  Everything tastes impeccable and wonderfully fresh.  Don't forget to hit up the dessert case before you leave!  I'll be a customer for life.

Not gonna lie, I kinda want to give a bad review because it's always crowded here....  But I can't.... it's amazeballs!!!  The food is delicious.  I have taken to ordering takeout as well which is still great.  Tastes like homemade in a grandma's kitchen.  Yum yum yum.

Just finished eating dinner from here for the first time.  A deal on Groupon brought us in, and the food will bring is back!  We had brisket that was cooked to perfection.  The pulled pork was delicious and flavorful.  Everything was moist and tender.  All of our sides were really great as well.  The cobbler was a great ending to our meal.  I have to say, not only was the meat fantastic, but for having lots of young kids working there, the customer service was great!  Everyone working there was helpful and polite.  My family and I will be back again!

I may have found my new breakfast go to.  Everything was devine.  I love supporting small local businesses that pack a big punch.  Crepe Bar delivers with  friendly staff and food that that tastes much bigger than its reasonable price tag.

Ordered take-out from here for the first time tonight.  We will definitely be back.  The sauce on the deep dish was fantastic.  It even got the kids approval, which is hard to do.  The crust was slightly over done, but I'd rather have it over done than under done like you get with a lot of other pizza places.  Soggy crust is the worst!  We also ordered wings which were fantastic.  I felt like the pricing was right for everything that we got.  Much better tasting food than a lot of gross chain pizza places out there.  Small business with big flavor.  See you next time!

I am a big fan of this place. My whole family really likes chicken wings, and I have to say this place takes the cake compared to other restaurants serving wings in the area. Not only is their sauce good, but the size of their wings are huge compared to other restaurants. I don't feel like I'm being cheated since the price of wings has gone up so much lately. I feel like I'm still getting what I want to get out of my money. I have eaten both in restaurant and gotten takeout. My experiences have been nothing but excellent either way.

Holy cow am I full!!!  Just finished eating and everything was so delicious I could not stop eating.  The gumbo is fresh and fantastic.  I tried a bit of everyone at the table's food as well, and you can sure tell each dish is made fresh and with a lot of love.  Even my daughter's Mac and cheese was great.  Try the fried green tomatoes and you won't regret it.  I can't wait to come back and eat here again.  The food is reasonably priced considering the portions and the taste that its obviously made to order.  Truly a culinary gem.

Stopped by here today (we don't eat cupcakes very often) and didn't realise it wasn't "that other bakery" any longer.  Since I was already there I decided to give them a shot.  The cupcakes all look very pretty.  If this was based off of service, they would get a 5.  The young woman working that day was very friendly.  I came for cupcakes, but she was happy to let me try some of the interesting Indian inspired ice cream flavors too.  Interesting.  Not bad.  Interesting.  I ordered four different cupcakes.  All nice looking.  All incredibly dry.  I am a terrible baker and I could have made better cupcakes from a box.  The peanut butter frosting and the Oreo frostings were fine.  Nothing amazing, but I want the cake part to be the hero of the cupcake.  Not even close.  I sadly won't be back.  You get two stars for your awesome staff member.  Keep her around!  (I wish I caught her name).  Next time, I'll probably cross the street to Kneaders.  I'd also be better off at Safeway.
