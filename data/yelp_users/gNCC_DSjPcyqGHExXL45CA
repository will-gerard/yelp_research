I guess cheap prices in turn leads to cheap low class people. Come here to order and that's most likely what you'll find. If the pizza were not so damn good and the prices as well and me not being in the area I would roast the shit out of this place. But all I can say every time I'm here is that the pizza is to die for. The only thing you might run into is a  wait on your order so I would recommend ordering online to skip the line and the low class people hobos you'll run into while you wait for your pizza.

Horrible service. Had to ask for bread to start the meal when normally they bring it out without hesitation. Then later refills on water never came. The main entree ordered was burnt when the restaurant was no even busy so there was extra waiting time to wait for the entree to be ready again. When the entree was finally done it came out burnt still on the noodles. Finally when it came to the check it was about 15 to 20 minutes before we left to pay and leave. We were the only table the waitress had and she decided to prepare drinks behind the bar before giving us the check and a box for our food. So she asked another server to get the check for us. When I put my card in the billfold we had to wait for the other server to process the payment while the waitress was still making drinks. It was very poor service and I was very disappointed and confused why she put drinks before servicing her only table. Her name was Cindy and if you ever have her as your waitress there I feel sorry for you. So bottom line I do not recommend this location to go dine at. One of the managers even asked our waitress if she knew how to make a certain drink and she responded yes. Why would the manager ask her that if she was the one responsible and hired as the bartender and should know all the main drinks that need to be served. I don't plan on coming back to this location any time soon. Likely never again.

First experience at Grimaldi's and the waitress was terrible we were here for it seemed the whole night like a couple hours. The pizza was good. Thin crust style burnt crispy crust. If it were not for the service it was overall an ok experience. The pizza wasn't that that good and not good enough to make it worth my money to come back. I also didn't like that toppings were a la carte. The pizza is well overpriced with a large cheese being 16. Toppings being 2 to 4 per topping. So no for pizza instead of a fine dining 5 course meal and wine 5 hour dining definitely not worth my time. The only positive about the waitress was she filled my water. I'm done and out!

If your looking to impress a lady friend this by far has a great atmosphere. However it can be a little noisy weekends so it may be a little difficult to communicate on a date or whoever your company is. The only things I would say is your going to have to pay to really enjoy the Mexican food. It's fine dining Mexican and yes it exists believe or not in Scottsdale. No 2.50 bean burrito is sold here. Anyway I had the soup which was rich and creamy with seafood mixed in but not worth $14. The chips and salsa were tasty and the hot salsa was very good with a kick. Portions are small yet very filling. Another con is the seats are hard and not very comfortable. I saw some people getting they're cell phones out to look at the menu because it's so dark inside. So if you get to dine in the patio do it because it's a great atmosphere. My server was black and very professional he knew the menu hands down and was on top of our table the whole time.

Pitas are always good. However at this location the water taste like they poured it from the toilet bowl. The server brought out lemonade that taste like something from Mars. Also he didn't bring out the food or do any refills. Not impressed with the service but pitas are always good. Good luck on the drinks because what we had sucked!!
