2-Stars is me being generous.   Food: Overpriced, mediocre, nothing special, and not to mention my friend received a piece of a plastic bag in his bowl of pho and I crunched into a shell-like component in my spring roll.  - Pho: We all ordered the combination pho (pho Ä‘ac biet) and it was large, tasty, but lacked a key element that we all enjoy in our combination pho - tripe. Apparently they do not sell tripe there (said the waitress). But they did make up for it by giving us generous portions of brisket and additionally included meatballs (bo vien) which I typically do not see in combination pho at other restaurants. The broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus. But I do believe a bowl of pho for about $9 is on the expensive side. All in all I would give their pho 3.5 stars.  - Spring rolls: I will post a picture of their spring rolls. They were composed of minimal elements for high-dollar. $5.50 for 2 spring rolls is super pricey in my book, especially because these spring rolls were far from anything special. Rice noodles, shredded lettuce, pork, and shrimp wrapped in rice paper (so basic!). They didn't even bother to add bean sprouts, mint leaves, or green onion to enhance the flavors. Also, their dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the peanut-side (some don't mind it but I prefer an equal balance). Never ordering spring rolls from them again (unless they actually read this post and start making better spring rolls and sauce).   Service: They took the pho (with plastic) and an order of spring rolls off our bill which was nice - but is expected when serving non-edible components in your food. When we notified our waitress about the plastic in my fiends bowl of pho, she quickly took it away and had another combination pho delivered to us pronto. The service is what saved this place from getting only 1-star.   Decor: Pretty modern but tries to keep an authentic Asian feel with the bonsai trees and fish tanks.   I suppose this place had a decent rep because it's open 24-hours and the name is catchy. I wanted to like this place but all-in-all, my experience was not one to bring me back. I can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places. Maybe if I was in desperate need of pho at a weird time of the night, I might settle for Pho Kim Long... Until then, Yelpers beware.

I brought a prescription in from another doctor. They have a wide selection of quality and trendy frames, not the kinds that feel like toy glasses that you can find at Walmart or Costco. It really does show that they care about their eyewear collections. The doctor and entire staff was very friendly and patient. They took their time to find the right pair of glasses for me and went through the different types of lens options that I could upgrade to for me to see the best vision possible! I'm happy with my glasses and I recommend this place!

My first time trying this place was about 2-3 weeks ago (end of Sep. 2015). I was really craving a good smoothie and found them on Google. It was late in the evening (past 8pm) and the Jamba Juice by my house was already closed. So decided to give this place a shot. I walked in and there was only one employee. I told her I was a first-timer and asked what were the popular items. She seemed really pleasant and was super helpful. I also asked what else was included in the smoothie and how they are sweetened. She was very knowledgable about their smoothies; I always appreciate when employees know exactly what they offer at their restaurant/cafe. So I ended up trying the "Island Greens". It was amazing and I was instantly hooked! I've been back 3-4 times since then.   My most recent trip was earlier today for lunch. I typically just get a smoothie but since I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I decided to try their food. This time there were two guys working. I asked they guy at the register about their flatbreads and he was able to describe them with detail and even suggested his favorites. So I ordered the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread. It was pretty good - it was basically a circle pita bread, toasted, and folded in half, stuffed with steak, Tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. I think there was some cheese in there too, but I ate it so fast I didn't even notice. I would recommend it.   Smoothies: 5-Stars! The Island Greens was the first thing I tried and haven't looked back. It's what I get every time.  Food: I have only tried the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread, and it was pretty good. Not too sure how fresh the steak was but I presume it is a better choice than your McDonald's and Burger King's of the world.  Customer Service: From the previous reviews, it would seem like this place has some issues with management, training their employees, and customer service, but I haven't had a problem with them. I suppose their staff could be a little more "jolly" but it's not like they were rude by any means.  Overall: Super happy with their smoothie. Customer service met my standards. Because this place is a SMOOTHIE spot, I give them 5-Stars.

AVOID AT ALL COST! This place is run by people who do NOT care for customer service. In a business where customer service should be #1, the person who manages/people who work here only care about taking the customers' money (namely Alex, Keith, and Angel). Every one of them told me at least one lie or two, or three. This is what happens when you talk out of your *bleep* - customers find out, and take their business elsewhere.   This store is NOT a Verizon store. They are a 3rd-party retailer that sells Verizon, so they do not have the same standards for customer service as a REAL Verizon store. These people work for commission and no matter what they tell you or how "nice" or "genuine" they appear to be, at the end of the day, they just want your money!   Backstory: I was with T-Mobile and looking to switch over to Verizon (transfer 4 lines and buying 3 or even 4 new phones). Went in one night with my brother to get some information about what Verizon offers. Keith did a "soft" credit check to see what they could offer me.  Lie: Keith told me the application number I opened up was only valid for 7 days.  Truth: It is valid for much longer - 1 month.  We left without starting up our service with Verizon because the iPhone 6S/6S Plus were about to drop within a couple days. So my brother and I returned a few days later and Angel helped us out. He seemed a little more genuine than Keith and thought he had our best interest in mind.  Lie: Angel told me they would give me $300 Verizon Visa for trading in my iPhone 5. Truth: I can only get $200 for a trade-in value. Lie: Angel told me that they would give $200 Verizon Visa for my brother's iPhone 5 with a cracked screen. Truth: They will not accept any iPhone with a cracked screen.  The truth was revealed to us AFTER we had placed our orders for our new 2x iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus ($300 down to hold our online orders). So I decided to cancel our orders and get a refund. We called in and Alex answered the phone. We asked how we can cancel our order and get our $300 back. He told us there was no way to do that until the ordered phones are at the store (estimated 3-4 weeks for the iPhone 6S Plus). So we would have to wait until the phones got there to go back and get our money back.  Lie: There was no way to cancel the order and get the refund until the phones arrived. Truth: I called into customer care and had the order cancelled and got a refund for $300.   Truth: These people do not care for customer service. They will tell you whatever just to get your money and will NOT do what it takes to take care of your concerns. After over-an-hour-long process, Angel get a "refund code" from the district manager and was able to refund my $300. (currently waiting for the credit to show in my account)  This experience could have been a lot better for both parties. Had they just been truthful and gave two *bleeps* about the customer (me), then they would have been able to score a T-Mobile member that transferred 4 lines, and bought 4 new iPhones.  Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!
