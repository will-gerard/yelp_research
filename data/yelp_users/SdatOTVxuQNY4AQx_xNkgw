Literally one of the worst dining experiences ever.   This restaurant is in our neighborhood and it looked so cute, I was very excited to get some breakfast and enjoy a beautiful day on their patio. We ordered after waiting for 15 minutes our waiter to even come to our table, we told him we were ready to order and he told us he would get us our drinks first. After waiting another 15 minute to get our ice tea, he finally took our order. Our food was brought to us by a women who looked like she clearly hated her job, she slammed the food on the table and walked away.   As I went to take my first bite I noticed a long hair draped across my plate. ewwww. I could not find our waitress so I waited 5 minutes and had to flag someone else down, who apologized took my plate and walked away. Our waitress came back another 5 minutes later and asked where my food was, I told her what happened and she apologized and instead of offering to replace us, she told us she would get our check. wtf.  I was blown away, I did not make a stink because I have worked in the service industry and I know you don't get anything when your rude.... but I wish I would have, because the owner or manager (I'm guessing)brought the bill and left a to go box for my sister. and that was that... they didn't even offer to replace my meal or comp it.   This place is truly a joke, I will never go back.

How on gods green earth does this place have 5 stars? I had the worse experience today and would never, ever recommend this place to anyone.   1. They had extreme police videos on Spike tv on full blast the whole time. I always bring my kindle to nail salons to read while I get my pedicure and could not concentrate at all because the volume was so loud.   The women who was doing my mani and gel pedi was way more concerned with the tv than my nails, to the point that she cut me while trimming my cuticles. I had to tell her that I was bleeding before she even noticed, she had literally just been watching the tv for about 30 seconds WHILE USING A SHARP OBJECT ON ME!!!   I dont know about any of you, but when I go to a nail salon I want to relax a little bit, not listen to sirens, gun shots or a narrator talk about how long people will be in prison for trying to kill their husband... maybe I am crazy though?   2. The gel manicure itself was horrible, 4 of my fingers have polish along the back of my nail bed and my pinky does not have any polish along one side. I tried telling the women while was doing the mani, but she just kept shaking her head and say it was fine, I am pretty sure she did not understand me.   3. After she was done, I politely said "I am very unhappy, this is not the type of manicure I am used to." She said, that she thought that they looked great and acted as though I was crazy. All the workers at this point started talking and the owner came over. She was young, and clearly lacked experience in customer service. She did not offer to fix them and said I had to pay. I gave her my credit card and told her I would never be back.    HORRIBLE!!!!!

Totally worth the wait, for all the people complaining about the wait... If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food, call ahead or go to Denny's. Their portions are very large, and honestly I don't get why that is a complaint, get a togo box and enjoy the rest of your lunch or breakfast later.  Everyone is always friendly who works there and you have to respect the fact that almost all of there food is locally sourced.

Stopped by for a quick lunch with my boss, neither of us had been before and we were both craving mexican. I was a little apprehensive, because it  has a little of the whole in the wall look to it, but I am usually happily surprised with the rougher looking establishments. I order the chicken chimichanga, which I believe is the yes way to judge a mexican restaurant.... it was probably one of the best I have ever had and if you know me, you know I LOVE mexican food. The service was great and there salsa was amazing.  I will definitely be going back!!

very impressed. I have to say I am glad to know the creators of Delux and Zen 32 continued their goal of owning the Biltimore neighborhood when it comes to to quality, moderately priced, creative cuisine. The only reason I am giving them 4 as opposed to 5 stars is because the burrito my sister got was a little too messy and it got on my table cloth:) The fish tacos were superb though, and their rice is amazing... because I love sweet corn in just about anything.

We loved this place! The wings are awesome and they have all different types of sauces and the Philly's aren't too bad either! I had the West Coast Philly with beef and it was delicious, did I feel guilty after eating? Yes, but I would do it again! My boyfriend had the The Works and loved his too. I do have to say if you get wings, one regular is enough to split between 2 people... we both had leftover. There prices are right on point in my opinion as well.   Did I mention they deliver?! Philly Cheese steak and wings right to our door!
