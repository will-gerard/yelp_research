Atmosphere: If you order out the first time you try TeePee, the experience is probably wasted.  Dive or no, the atmosphere at TeePee is part of the experience.  It's sort of Mod meets taco stand meets dive bar-- and I can't explain why that's a good combo but, imho, it is.  It's also dimly lit and the bar area is full of little Christmas lights that make for a great casual date.  However, that being said, I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities    The food: Albeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard, this place is just ultimately satisfying.  Order the beef burro.  It's a must.  I don't think you can love this place as well if you don't.  The chile is perfect- I like the red and the green equally well, just depending on mood.  I'd second the opinions about the rice- it's really inexplicably good.  The chips, yeah, probably greasy but GOOD.  It's all greasy and good.  Don't eat here regularly- it will kill you.  Eat here when you need delicious, satisfying, comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis.    Service- I've always loved it but had one slow experience.  It's a hit and miss but I usually go during less-busy hours to avoid the crowds that can sometimes congregate.    The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's not really authentic Mexican, if that's what you're looking for and the dive vibe may turn some people off.  I personally love it.

The Clarendon was also a staycation spot for me and a friend and I went and had a pretty lovely time.  Great things: *The rooftop- the bar wasn't open but it was easy to just get a drink downstairs and bring it up.  The view of the city and the pretty pool is great. *The restaurant- Gallo Blanco: I'm going to crave that guacamole every day for the rest of my life.   * The pool and huge hot tub- the hot tub could have been warmer but it's great to have one so big. *The Beds: So comfortable- they don't lie when they brag about their beds & sheets. *The decor- so much character.  *The staff- great waiter in the restaurant, great hotel staff, great bartenders.  Quick and easy check-in and check-out. *Attention to details- they have to-go coffee cups for you so you can make and take coffee from your room.   Bad things: *They need to update their pool furniture.  It looks like it's seen better days- the outdoor chaises looked too dirty for me to want to lay on them and the other outdoor furniture was faded and pretty dirty.   *They could really use an outdoor pool bar because it's impossible to be in a swimsuit and go into the bar to get a drink.   *A lot of people complain about the AC- it seems they're in the process of adding individual air conditioners to rooms and ours definitely had one so we were comfortable.  However, the elevator is uncomfortably lacking in AC. *Spotty housecleaning- there was "something suspicious" on my headboard and a dirty pool towel left in our room.   *They make you sign something that says you won't bring alcohol into the hotel...  Overall, I will definitely go again and had a great time.

There is no point writing a full review with all the good things people have already said (accurately) about Cornish.  I only write to rank my favorites:  1) Carne Adovada 2) Peppered Steak (omgcreamybrandysauce) 3) Spicy Asiago Chicken 4) Pesto Chicken  P.S. GET THE BANOFFEE- I DON'T CARE HOW FULL YOU ARE.   Only request- more beers on tap please!

The food: The reviews are true- the lamb kuzi is ridiculously good and a great buy.  It is tender, well seasoned and very generous in proportion.  They garnish with almonds and raisins and serve with a large portion of well-cooked (and high quality) rice.  I will echo other reviews that the vegetarian musaka is great but it was a definite second to the lamb if you're a meat eater.  If eggplant is your thing, it's salty, savory, good texture for the eggplant and just enough garlic.  Atmosphere: The place was pretty empty while we were there- a Thursday night- but it was cute and comfortable.  Nothing high-brow but that's part of its charm.    Service: The owner, Ali, waited on us and was more than accommodating. If you're into supporting local businesses with charming owners, here is a another stop for you.   We told him we heard about the restaurant on Yelp and that seemed to excite him though he wasn't really sure what Yelp was.  In the end, he gave us a free baklava which my dinner date liked but I thought was a little too peppery.  It's not the traditional baklava (extra cardamom I believe) but he liked the spin on it.  I guess I'm boring enough to prefer something more traditional.  All in all, a great experience- can't wait to go back to try more on the menu.  I'm sure it's all just as great of a deal and just as delicious.  One Downside- for you drinkers, no alcohol.  I'm going to suggest a BYOB endeavor for Ali...

This place is pretty ridiculous.  A friend scheduled an appointment here without doing any research as to what he was scheduling.  I didn't realize it was on the Waterfront... had I known this... maybe I would have assumed the following.  All of the frames are ridiculously overpriced as they do not stock anything that is not designer.  The cheapest frames ended up being Prada frames, if that tells you anything.  Further, the selection is really limited, not providing a lot of choice for different styles.    The Sales girl was a typical optical sales person- trying really hard to pitch stuff that, after 17 years of wearing glasses, I know is not necessary (anti-glare lenses ... had both anti-glare and regular... really no difference other than a $75 mark up).  I understand it's her job but even after realizing we were on a budget, she wouldn't give up.  Further, she pulled the doctor back out of his office to make him try to help her with the pitch.  Salegirl: "Doctor, is he going to need these for driving?"  Doctor: "Oh, yes."  Salesgirl: "See, you're really going to need the anti-glare"... etc.    If you're okay with all designer prices... how about not being able to try on any lenses without having the salesperson get them out of the glass case?  They try to add to their "prestige" image by keeping everything under locked glass but it's really just not very user-friendly as you feel awkward asking them to take pairs out again and again if you're stuck between choices.    Even with full VSP vision insurance that covered the exam and a base rate on the frames and lenses (which couldn't cover anything in the store), we left spending $300 out of pocket.    Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone... too expensive, limited selection, too much of a hassle, too pushy.  They get 2 stars instead of 1 because the doctor was friendly and professional.

SERVICE Stumbled upon this place while shopping in Tempe Marketplace.  We went to dinner around 5 on a Saturday so it was not crowded at all.  That being said, to echo others, the service was pretty bad when there was really no reason for it to be so.  Ordered a salad and was not asked what dressing I wanted so I assumed it was already dressed.  Salad was served with no dressing and could not flag down a server to get dressing for about 10 minutes.  I sat there and made my companions all feel to awkward to eat because I couldn't eat the salad without dressing (literally, dry as a bone).   It was generally hard to get our server to our table and when we managed, he seemed irritated.    MENU Largely overpriced.  It's bar food with a little extra but at dinner prices.  My companion had the Sliders which were unremarkable but the beef was of relatively good quality.   I ordered the Chop Shop cobb which was again, overpriced (aprox $12 for something a bit larger than a dinner salad) which was fresh and had some good produce (although my avocado was not ripe) but again, not dressed and sort of boring in the end.   Diversity was lacking- a small selection of pretty generic offerings.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY This is going to gross some people out but I was given a straw without a wrapper on it and when I put it in my mouth, it was salty... as though someone had stuck a sweaty/dirty hand into a bin of straws.  My dinner companion had the exact same experience.  We were both really unnerved and grossed out.    ATMOSPHERE It's brand new so the facilities are generally clean and well kept but the atmosphere is ridiculous.  It's sort of Texas Roadhouse meets Coyote Ugly and neither work very well.  There's just something awkward about trying to eat dinner with a mechanical bull beside you.

MENU They only have a very small menu of appetizers but they're actually pretty tasty.  I love the brie and the spinach dip and am not quite sure how they manage to do it without a real kitchen.  They also allow you to order in from Thai Basil or Tessio's Pizza in their complex.  I recommend both.  Although, please don't get double Thai spicy and drink beer with it.  It's a bad idea.  Trust me.    THE BEER Uh-mazing variety.  They have a cooler with all the beers they sell and about 8 beers that rotate on tap, including a good variety of 10%'ers.  They regularly stock Rogues, Lagunitas, Left Hand, and Sierra Nevada's more obtuse varieties among lots of other craft beers.  They do a good job of keeping the tap full of very different-tasting beers and keeping my palate in rotation.  Yum.  Rarely dislike their tap choices.   CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY New, clean, cute.  SERVICE I love the bartenders here.  They're all attentive and great at their jobs and never get irked when you want to taste something.  Plus, if you order at the bar, they'll still bring it out to you at a table.    ATMOSPHERE Sort of bare bones wine bar atmosphere BUT always stocked with great art.  They have a new artist every month and I'm almost always into them.

MENU Guess What?  No real food here- just hot dogs, nachos and a couple other things.  Think Taste of Top's model.  But, the perk compared to Top's is that they allow you to bring in or order anything, not just businesses in their complex (I don't think there are any that serve food anyway).  They keep a nice little collection of take-out menus compiled in books behind the bar and the tables have ample room for eating.  Fun, cheap way to do things actually- no need to tip!  They give you pub mix on the tables too.    THE BEER A good variety of flavors, all representative of their type but I would echo a friend's comment that everything was "What you expect with a little less flavor."  Some people dig the ability to drink more because of a lack of overwhelming tastes but I do wish that, for instance, their IPA had a higher alcohol content and more punch.  I've been drinking a lot of bold beers lately though, so I may just be expecting too much by comparison.  But, their beers are all named after dogs which is pretty freakin' cute.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY Brand new, spotless, modern, spic & span.    SERVICE The servers are all really friendly and quick, probably due to the fact that they seem to have some trouble keeping busy.     ATMOSPHERE Adorable.  This is why I like to drink here.  They have booths covered in puppy dog print fabric that made me fall in love.  It's very open and industrial in a good way, with lots of bright, happy colors everywhere..  The bathroom is really modern and funky and has a walk-in-freezer door handle to exit.  Awesome details.  They have jazz there on Tuesday nights and board game nights (I think on Monday- I haven't been to one but a friend vouched for it).  They also have the board games out the rest of the time so you can play whenever you want.  They have a huge collection of tv's too and often play fun cult classics.    ADDITION- I forgot to mention- I did data entry here for hours and they played a great collection of music.  This is super important to me in any venue and they get 5 stars just for that!  I hope this place catches on enough to do good business but not enough to get so crowded I can't get one of my puppy dog booths!

THE DOCTOR Dr. Kidess in one word: professional.  Her busy is a tightly-run ship.  She's one of the few doctors I've met that understands that while we need doctors for our lives, we have choices.  She treats you like a consumer in the best way possible- she earns your business.  She consults you about every choice and decision, fully explains your options, and never tries to "sell."  She is always concerned about your comfort and making sure she's doing everything she can for you.    THE SERVICE The whole staff is very comfort-oriented.  Everyone wants to make sure the experience is not only effective but totally painless.  They care about things like your view of the tv (see below), the angle of your head, etc.  They make sure you're happy. That's a really big feet when you have a drill in mouth.    THE PRICE Average.  I paid out of pocket for a lot so that was rough but they're conservative in their treatment plans.  They lay out multiple tiers of what kinds of work you should have done, can have done when you get the money, and optional preventative measures.  Also, they're very clear about what things cost- there are never any surprises or hidden huge fees later.  She's proactive enough to ward off future problems (she was the first dentist to ever identify how bad my teeth grinding was and how much damage it was causing/would continue to cause) but not grubbing for your dollars.    THE OFFICE Super modern.  I will echo the former review that Dr. Kiddess has the latest cutting-edge dental technology, including a PERSONAL DVD PLAYER while you get your teeth worked on, complete with a good collection of movies.  This made catching up with a few years of dental neglect a breeze.  I watched Little Miss Sunshine almost in its entirety over 3 weekly appointments.  They even scanned to the place I left off :-)

I see Dr. Ackerman so my review will be based on her.  There is another Doctor in the office however, Dr. Kessler.  Dr. Ackerman is the primary doctor I believe.    THE DOCTOR Dr. Ackerman is very young- I'd guess around 30, so I believe the practice is pretty new.  She got her MD in 2007, according to the big fancy diploma on her wall (and from Tulane, for all you private school snobs out there... don't worry, I'm included).  She's nice, professional, but not super warm.  She comes off very businesslike and sort of agressive about treatment so if that turns you off and you want more chit chat and a little more smiling, she probably won't be for you. She's friendly though, so don't get me wrong.  Just not a kindergarten teacher type.   I liked that she didn't waste my time and listened closely to what I had to say and responded with exactly the treatment I had hoped she would.   Also, I mentioned as an aside that I was a runner and she remembered that when prescribing sun-sensitive medication, without having to ask.  Good attention to detail.    THE SERVICE Super efficient and friendly.  The have a very large staff and a large patient volume if the number of people in the waiting room says anything.  They manage it seamlessly, however.  The receptionist was very polite even though I was a flake and managed to be late and forget my insurance card.  She didn't scold and helped me figure it out and got me in and out quickly anyway.  Also, I booked an appointment for a couple of different issues and they resolved them both right away and didn't make me come back a second time and pay more office fees etc.    THE PRICE I have insurance so I have no idea.  However, I included this to note that she put me on a very expensive medication without warning me.  It didn't affect me because I had perscription insurance so I guess that's probably why she didn't say anything.  I would have liked to know though, because my insurance will be changing soon and it may affect me then.   THE OFFICE For those who care about these things with doctors' offices (and I do- if I'm going to be stuck waiting and made uncomfortable, I'd like it to be as pleasant as possible)....    Clean, nicely decorated, newly remodled, new everything.  Comfortable exam rooms that are kept very tidy and hygenic.  Believe it or not, I can't say that about all doctors I've been to in the valley.

A foreword to this review- everyone PLEASE visit Republic Ramen for my own selfish purposes.  I've been waiting forever for quality boba somewhere near me and a legit ramen place.  This is it.  Support them :-)  MENU Noodles: The complaint from serious Ramen lovers here is that the menu might be a little limited.  However, it's Arizona, they're doing what they do right, and well, it's Arizona.  With the different varieties of add-ins and their spice/sauce selection, you can pretty much have any kind of delicious ramen you want.   They have 6 standard types of broth and 9 add-ins to mix it up.  They also have 3 combo options with edamame, gyoza, and curry rice.   Boba: In case you haven't heard, the restaurant is split into a tea care and a noodle house.  The tea cafe has a great selection of boba flavors, tea varieties and a good solid tapica pearl (not overly sweet).  Props to the Taro- it's my favorite I've had so far which includes Chinatowns in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. They also have Snows (basically an awesome slushy) and regular teas.    DRINKS: See above for the boba.  The owner said they're trying to get a liquor license and he envisions an alcoholic boba menu in the future. Whaaaat?  Best idea ever.  But, as of now, no booze.    VALUE: (hey, look! new cateogry to my reviews!) The ramen is priced exactly how it should be, so long as you save the double helping for the next meal.  Don't throw it!  It's completely comparable to Ramen in bigger cities.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY Brand new, spotless.  Great modern design and classy casual feel.    SERVICE They were a bit slow for what I ordered in the tea shop but the ramen comes out really quickly.  You can also order ahead for easy takeout.  I've only eaten in-house once so my service knowledge is limited.  Their takeout is 100% dependable, however.    ATMOSPHERE Urban casual without compromising atmosphere.  I would even take a date here- quick and funky, full of character, nice people, and definitely empty since this place is new and has trouble keeping a crowd (Again, please support- they're great!)

Okay- listen. For starters, I haven't written a review in forever because I haven't been to some place that i felt needed it.  This place deserves a good review in the midst of some pretty bad ones.  I'm busy lately and I had a good enough time to yelp and cared enough about the people there based on one experience to take the time.  That's something.    I'm not going to say much about the restaurant other than the burger we ordered was pretty tasty, fries were fresh and appeared hand-cut, and they batter their own chicken fingers.  More than I expected.   Bar:  Just do it.  Jason, the bartender, made our afternoon.  He was friendly, kept us in more alcohol than we ever intended on drinking (isn't that what makes a good bartender), was witty, interesting, and made the whole experience.  We had a Groupon too.  They accepted it gladly- no Groupon attitude (pet peeve).  They put the game on for us (hell, they gave us the remote!), made sure to check on us frequently and didn't give us attitude when we wanted to switch seats and sections (we tipped out both!)  The bar space is actually really comfortable.  A lot of tables, some cushy seats, and the bar stools that don't make your lower half go numb from sitting in them for any amount of time.  The music is vintage which added to the charm along with the warhol-esque prints.  Fun.  Not typical.  Something different.  Towards the later parts of the evening, a live funk-inspired band came in.  By then, I'd had enough table shots to get DOWN to it.  The band was good.  My dancing was better.   Are you going to feel like someone important while you're there? No.  It's not the Vig.  Are there some kinks to be ironed out in this new place?  Sure.  Was the owner there and friendly when we were there?  Yes.  Did it seem like everyone was trying to make us happy?   Yes.    Are the drinks cheap & strong? Yes.  Did I intend to stay there 1 hour and end up staying from 4pm-10:30pm?  Um, whoops, yes. Good times were had.  Recommended.    This place gets 4 stars for the bar.  It mostly gets 4 stars for Jason.  If you replicate the experience we had, it will be a 4 star experience.   It also gets 4 stars because it's a NEW place, appears to be trying, and I think has a lot of potential if people are patient.

As someone who manages a rental property, I get pretty comfy with service companies.  I called Empire when for my own residence last year for air conditioning problems.  Essentially, the breaker kept kicking for problems that I finally found out a year later were purely a result of the breaker installation (not relevant) but Empire basically took our service fee, reset the breakers, and said it was due to inconsistent output from the AC unit and put a thingiemagie on there.  All I know is that it cost $250+.  It managed to control the problem until the end of the year by coincidence because it was the end of AC season and the AC was running infrequently.  A year later, I found out it's an electrical problem on the breaker and the fix they made was necessary and didn't solve the problem.   This is where my amnesia kicks in.  I completely forgot about all of this/my dissatisfaction when I called them again 16 months after that fiasco for my rental property.  There was a hot water heater leak and I needed someone to check it out/diagnose.  They said we needed a new water heater (which we do) and quoted us over $1100.  I did all this via phone from work because it's not my house and I had to remedy something quickly (while at work).  For the life of me, I could not get the technician to stop selling me the service package (Which is how I finally remembered it was them!  The company from a year before!  They won't stop talking about the service package before giving you a quote!) and just give me the #$*(@#$ quote so I could make a decision (at work, on the phone) about how to proceed with the pricey fix.   After interrupting and even having to be a little firm and rude, I finally got the price quote and let him know that No, I was NOT interested in the service package or what the water heater would cost me with the service package. I want to know what it will cost me.  Today.  By itself.  Whew.  So, I finally got the quote.  Way too high.  When I stated I thought it was high, I was again sold on how they could "do it today" and "the service package will save me $120 dollars!" Good day sir.  Here's your $29.99 service fee.  I'll call you tomorrow.  No, no, I won't.  I got Home Depot to do the sale of the heater, the install, and the take away of the old unit for $800.  It's my own fault, really... the amnesia.  My advice?  Write down every service company you shouldn't use again... somewhere.
