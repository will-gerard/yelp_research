Get the fish and chips.  Repeat, get the fish and chips.  The fish tacos are good, but not as good as the fish and chips.  A barbeque sandwich is also good, the sauce is more mustard based than most and is a nice change.  The new owners ran food service at the sports arena so the food tends to be what you can get at the suites (or feels like it).  You don't come here for good health though.  There really isn't anything healthy (like the old Tom's) and lots of the downtown set i.e. lawyers and politicos tend to gather here to see and be seen.

The food isn't great.  I really only like the chocolate cake which is strangely sweet but does not have much chocolate flavor.  (Still I'm strangely addicted to it).  The food is rather bland, the main flavoring ingredient seems to be salt and oregano and that's about it.

One of the only places in town to serve this delicious dessert wine called Lilly-Pulli  (raspberries floating in champagne yummo)  Great place for a quick business lunch or a fancier girls night out.  Excellent cheese selection and flatbread pizzas.  I like to sit outside or at least facing the window to see the Light Rail zoom past.  It almost makes Phoenix feel like a big, well bigger city than it is.

Yummy mom and pop place.  Excellent ceviche and I love ordering the molcajete.  It comes bubbling and filled to the brim with seafood goodies served in a volcanic rock container.  The chips could use a little work, but with all the plentiful Pacificos that come on out, I don't generally notice or remember by the end.

Love this place. it is so peaceful and beautiful.  Came here as part of a large business function.  We were taken on a quick tour of the trails.  I've been here previously and taken in the butterfly garden (totally worth the extra you pay).  It has rotating events and art that is changing.  I love coming here for the special events such as Chocolate and Chile fest.  Getting a drink in one of the gardens and watching the sun set is one of the most relaxing and romantic ways to spend a quiet evening.  A must see for locals and guests alike.

Great lunch buffet, for the price, you get a ton of different types of food to try.  The naan is great and piping hot.  I will say that their chicken tikki masala is not my favorite but overall for the ambiance, this place is super pretty and delicious!

Can't say this is the most authentic Chinese fare around.  It is however, dependable and tasty.  The lunch menu comes out in a flash, (parking is horrible) but you can actually get in and out within 40 minutes if you have to.  Dinner again is good, nothing mind blowing but worth a try.  Get a mix of the regular dishes and then try out the less ordered stuff  (i.e. they actually do have a secret menu in Chinese, just point and order if you have to)

Great service, and great food.  Passed snacks included an artichoke cake served cold with an olive tapenade.  My favorite was a shaved beef with mascapone dressed in truffle oil.  The main courses included a cesar salad served in individual cups.  Sliders were delicious with my favorite being chicken with roasted pineapple.  They had a wonderful shrimp pasta dish that was gobbled up by people.  Desserts were cupcakes in four different flavors, red velvet with real cream cheese frosting, a chocolate decadent cupcake, luscious lemon and finally a vanilla buttercream.  I will definately recommend them for our next catering event in house.

I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants, but as chain restaurants go, its a good one.  It is a bit cheesy (both in food and in sense of humor) but the food portions are huge and taste pretty good.  The price points are good and the service is friendly.  This place is always packed.  So be prepared for a wait.  They have pizza to please both fans of the thin crust or the thick.  Although if you get the thick crust pizza be prepared for a wait.  I always get the wedding soup which is delicious with meatballs and small bits of pasta in a chicken broth.  It is not too salty which makes me super happy!  If you're brave get a pizza cookie they can get it to have two different kinds of pizza dough and topped with vanilla ice cream.

Deliciously inventive.  I almost always get the ika mentai noodles.  The bread that they give you (complimentary) is fresh and good.  The salads are delicious.  I will say however that service is a bit slow, they mean well but it certainly is not an "in and out" type of place.  The sushi is not the most complicated or fussy, but for a great neighborhood spot, this place can't be beat.

Romantic BYOB place.  A little pricey, the food tends towards meditteranean/french influence but tasty.  I come really for the desserts (which they will do for take out).  A nice place for a lunch or romantic dinner.  Also, you can have them cater baby showers and birthday parties in the house next door.

This is an amazing bakery.  Its run by a Taiwanese couple who have had the bakery for many many years now.  They specialize in cakes that are frosted in whipped cream (actually it might be a non-dairy whipped something) it tastes like a more stable cool-whip.  They have a ton of cakes but my favorites include the fresh mango, the fresh fruit cake and their chocolate cake.  The coconut cake is not coconut flake, but young coconut flesh, so be warned!  They also make mini desserts that are about 2.50 a pop and delicious as well as these coffee jellos that are amazingly caffeinated and delicious.  They hadle large sheet cakes and wedding cakes.  They are very reasonably priced (much better than many local bakeries) although they do not do the super fancy and trendy fondant coverings.  They are a simply delicious sponge cake, filled with different fruits or fillings with a whipped cream topping.  The cake is fresh and ready to pick up in their refrigerated section.  For the best selection you are always better off just calling and ordering or stopping in.  They also have a selection of Asian style desserts and meat buns.  They run a special on baked goods late in the evening that haven't sold so that they maintain a fresh inventory.  They close at six generally and is almost always open.  I cannot sing its praises enough, and I am a Huge Huge dessert person.  The desserts are not too sweet and the ake is just moist enough.  I get my birthday cakes here and they are always a big hit!

You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland.

I'll admit that I spend more time at the downstairs bar for 1/2 price wine night (Sun. Mon. Tues) than upstairs.  They also have a great $5.00 small plate special during happy hours and reverse happy hours.  The food is good, the ambiance especially downstairs where there is a roaring fire and a large copper bar.  parking can be tight on busy nights but the place is well wroth a wait if there is one.  For a more formal dinner, make reservations and eat upstairs.  Dessert is the one weak point on the menu, (as in it is only so-so) but who cares when there are enchiladas and chile rellenos and brie/mushroom toasts, and vegetable platters, and the best sea bass...but I digress...just head out there!

Came here for afternoon tea with friends.  If you are going to splurge on the tea, you might as well pay the extra 15 dollars for unlimited sparking wine.  Geoffrey the tea sommelier will refill it as much as he refills the tea.  My favorite tea by far was his blend of coconut jasmine.  Absolutely heavenly.  I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but by the time the dessert course rolls around, you will be plenty full.  The scones are the best, they are served with clotted cream, raspberry jam and lemon curd.  Simply decadent and heavenly.  The piano player adds a nice touch.  A nice change of pace from the original field trip.  You are paying a bit (there is an extra "tea service" charge on top of gratuity and tax, but well worth it.

This place is just okay.  The soup was a little salty, and the hummus which I generally adore wasn't awesome.  I think it was home made but it didn't have enough olive oil or tahini.  If I can't get good hummus I might as well eat at the Arby's next door, or run into TJ's.  The place is clean and a quick lunch which is nice.  Not the best place, but probably not a bad idea to introduce a picky eater to the joys of garlic and Mediterranean food.

Went here for the first time based on a promotional deal I had purchased off of New Times.  Got a spa pedicure and a shellac manicure.  I hadn't made a reservation ahead of time (as instructed to), but the gal who does nails was kind enough to stay late and squeeze me in.  She was professional, kind and sweet.  This is the place you go to when you want to splurge (but not spend quite as much as you do at Dolce salon in Scottsdale).  They have lots of promotions and deals when you go in, and you can also like them on facebook.  They have cute jewerly and cards also for sale. Great selection of colors and I love the shellac manicure in particular!  My nails look amazing.  A note on the prices, again, not the cheapest place in town, certainly not your quick corner nail salon.  The folks who work here all have licenses and have gone to actual nail school, esthetician school etc.  A shellac manicure and spa pedicure runs about 100 dollars before tip to give you a sense of the prices.  Oh and its right next door to a nail salon that is unrelated and not owned by them.  Do not do what I do and walk into the wrong place, super embarassing!

Was at a business function where Avanti was the caterer.  Given that the group consisted of 160 guest, I was concerned that the quality of food would suffer.  I really should not have worried.  The menu was simple.  A simple salad, followed by a main course of a veal chop and dessert with berries and whipped cream. The veal chop was stuffed with spinach and a little cheese.  It was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I don't think I've ever had a veal chop this moist and delicious.  The berries with whipped cream were a perfect ending, as it was light and it was served with a crispy florentine with just the right amount of sweetness.  I've been to the restaurant and had mixed feelings, but for a catered event (this was at the Art Museum) I now have a renewed respect for the quality of Avanti's catering service.

Don't know if there is any truth to the contention that the only reason Houston's rebranded itself as Hillstone was to avoid having enough restaurants to be required to disclose its calorie content....I don't care though.  It's still Houston's with the puzzling addition of sushi.  I'm not sure they get many orders for sushi and would as soon see that middle space be used as a dessert bar or extra bar.   They still have the great veggie burger (although with the recent additon of beets it seems sweeter) and the fried chicken salad.  Again, I don't actually want to know the calorie contents so I'm good with the non-disclosure.  The new location is huge.  There is a piano in the corner and a large patio.  It is much lighter and brighter than the old location due to lots of windows.  I especially love the double doors which are huge and remind me of a bank.  Plus they have a little koi pond even :)

Have been here both for dinner and lunch.  Spendy, but worth it for dinner.  The lunch crowd is very much the "ladies who lunch" set.  You'll be hard pressed to find a guy in the place, but for dinner you will find larger corporate groups as well as couples wanting some romance in Scottsdale.  Go while the weather holds and you can sit on the patio.  They have some of the best fois gras around.  (Possibly even better than Lon's if you happen to like fois that is).  You'll also see some intimate wedding parties, baby and bridal showers etc in the back rooms.  My favorite is the "library" room. Their desserts are wonderful and I should note that they will also customize cakes for special occasions, and the cakes will rival any bakeries in town. Try not to fill up on the bread, although I always do due to the pesto that is served with it.

One of the best resorts around.  Romantic, hidden and tucked away.  Staff is very accomodating and the casitas are spaced far away enough from each other that the patios do feel really private.  Depending on the time of year, you can get a decent price on a room.  The pool area is smallish compared to newer resorts but have been nicely rennovated.

So they are a little expensive, and a little on the sweet side, but with a glass of milk and a friend, they are delicious.  Don't miss the coconut or the red velvet cupcakes!  The regular cakes are a little too sweet for my taste, even though the ooey gooey is supposed to be acclaimed.  I'd just stick with the cupcakes.

Still one of my favorites.  The bruschetta is delicious and the fact that you can order different kinds appeasing my non-commital inability to make a decision self.  Tuesday nights are almost impossible to get a seat at now that they have a special running where you can get a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for like $20.00 bucks or something ridiculous.  Have small bills with you as the parking situation almost requires that you go through the valet.  The restaurant is great for a light nibble or a heavier dinner if you get a pressed sandwich or salad.  (The chicken salad in particular is one of my favorites)  You'll see a lot of couples here on first dates (which can be a lot of fun to people watch)  I've seen some really awkward dates, and some really great ones were you're convinced you're seeing magic happen right in front of your very eyes.

One of my favorite brunch spots.  Not the cheapest, but you come here to admire the Arcadia families/couples coming into have brunch.  There is sometimes a wait but it is worth it.  I have a hard time deciding between the lunch salads and breakfast.  I usually cave and get the french toast or ginormous belgian waffle.  Parking is plentiful but it is on a weird corner in the strip mall, if you are going, look for cork and cleaver.

I cannot believe I've lived in Az for as long as I have without trying this place.  Finally went and I am so glad I did.  The sliders are the perfect size, you can order them in single patty or double patties with or without cheese.  The hotdogs come with fries.  For about ten dollars you can feed three people, your cardiologist will not be happy with you, but the food is so tasty.  Parking is painful, that is my biggest complaint.  The staff is super nice and will even give out free re-fills.  You can't beat that.  I'm excited to head back to try the rest of the menu including their full sized hamburgers and their chili cheese fries.  Might have to wait until next month, I did just have that massive fondue dinner....

Delicious mom and dad place.  I really like their Tom Yum soup.  Some of the best yellow curry around.  Great compromise between price and ambiance.  It's mom and pop but its not super scary inside (i.e. its bright and clean) Take a bunch of friends and order lots!

Had feared that after moving to chic Scottsdale the food would suffer.  Thankfully that is not the case.  I love their pasta.  I don't even bother with the proteins, it is the pasta that is the star.  The crowd tends to skew a little older, (i.e. not the best place to that your fraternity brother), and even a first date might be a little off-putting.  In fact, you should probably confirm you like the person since the prices are a little steep.  But if you are willing to make the time and money commitment, there is no better place in town for wonderful fresh pasta that is toothsome and delicious.  The sauces lovingly envelope each bite and never overwhelms.  Bread is served and it is good, but do not fill up on bread no matter how much you like the eggplant spread that comes with it.  Come hungry, leave happy.  I'm still smiling.

I often crave the ravioli.  Little pillos of cheese in a tomato sauce splashed with a hint of cream.  Delicious.  The rest of the menu is standard Italian fare.  They restaurant is friendly and kind, desserts are good and the bread is always hot and garlickly.  (A plus in my book).  Give it a whirl, I always called it my "compromise" restaurant when I didn't want to spring for Marcellinos.  It's not as tasty, but not nearly as expensive either.

Do not go into the bathroom. I repeat, do not go into the bathroom.  (There are likely rest stops nicer).  Do go however for awesome pizza and calzones.  They take Pino's Pizza (3rd and Central) and kick their ass.  It is homemade, the crust pops and sizzles.  The marinara served on the side could use a little more oomph, but the slice.  The slice is a thing of beauty.  Oh and a slice will cost you $2.22.  Another thing of beauty.  Ignore the fact that it is a dive, or revel in the fact that it is a dive.  But keep this neighborhood place in the rotation.  There aren't enough mom and pop places out there that we can support.  It's sandwiched between a zoyo and a paradise bakery for cripe's sake.

Neighborhood pizzaria right across from my other favorite, Pat's Pizza.  Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy.  The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side.  In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak.  But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?

Great Chips and Salsa (especially the flour chips).  The meals aren't the most exciting.  But you don't come here for cutting edge reimaginations, you come here for the old school feel and reliable menu.  The Sunday brunch comes with a chocolate fountain for goodness sakes (a fad that should have died a merciful death about ten years ago).  Everything here is tasty, full fatty and will taste better if you drown it in the salsa.  The happy hour is generally packed and it's nice to see a place that refuses to change with the times.

Love this place.  Gus is warm and funny.  (He is Greek after all).  Not shy about telling you what he thinks.  He'll work with you on your price range.  They run great specials and are quick with the tailoring.  They have suits in all ranges, sizes.  I can't wait until he moves and starts carrying women's suits.

One of the best places in the valley for Cantonese/Hong Kong styel bbq meats and rice plates.  The food is delicious and ridiculously cheap.  It is not consequence that you will see a lot of students from MCC and ASU eating here.  Follow their lead and order a rice plate or platter of bbq proteins.  Otherwise come here and order family style and you will be in heaven.

Not the most generous of Korean places (i.e. their small appetizer plates that start the meal are a bit meager) but other than that complaint, I really like this place.  (Also conveniently located next to a Korean market in the event you get inspried to make your own meals).  The stews are delicious and the bulgulgi isn't too sweet.  I really like their bibimbap.  If you don't mind smelling of garlic for a week, check it out.

One of my favorite destinations for everything imagainable.  More variety of dried goods and fresh products than the other markets.  Conveniently located next to dimsum at Phoenix palace and Vietnamese Restaurants.  Lees sandwiches is also across the street.  They even have an Asian jeweler located inside.  Great place to find rice cookers and small Asian styled plates (way cheaper than Cost Plus by the way).  Huge liquor section for beer and sake.  Fresh fish, Fresh fish, Fresh fish.

Been ages since I went in and Justina was as kind and as gracious as if I had just been there yesterday.  The prices are going to be more than Da Vang or Khai Hoan, but you are paying for the hospitality and warmth that infuses the food.  You can bring your own liquors, otherwise the drinks available are the thai teas, Vietnamese coffee, salted lemonade sort.  I think the vermicelli noodle dishes are slightly tastier than the pho.  The spring rolls are not to be missed.  Give it a whirl again.  It's been around a long time now and there is a reason it's still here.  No need for reservations but remember that the restaurant is small.  I'd go on the early side to avoid a wait.

Great place for a group of friends to share a bunch of sushi and sake.  Came here for a birthday party and they were so accomodating allowing us to push together several tables.  They have a good sake selection (both warm and cold).  The sushi is generously portioned, you will not go away hungry.  The rolls are plentiful and they have plenty of fancy shmancy rolls involving fifteen ingredients, I prefer my sushi simple to highlight the quality of fish.  Regardless of what you like, Sakana will have it.  They have a great happy hour with beer specials and food for luck a buck.  (No joke).  I just wish one was closer to me.

One of the best resorts.  Whether as a hotel guest, or just as a guest walking on the grounds.  Staff is kind, the drinks are pricey but delicious and they have the prettiest walking paths around.  There are plenty of private paths to take a romantic stroll, there are cacti and succulents to make life interesting, and there are gondaleers singing and willing to take you for a gondala ride.  If you are really adventurous you can karaoke in the karaoke grotto.

Under new ownership.  The old place was scary.  The new owners are cheery and nice.  Great prices ($20.00 for mani etc)  They have about 65 of the 85 new shellac manicure colors.  Great new massage chairs.  Ask for Michelle or Tiffany.  The great thing is that the music isn't horrible (still going to be adult contemporary stuff but at least no Bolton) and the products are good.  They don't sit around and talk about you (always my annoyance at the nail salons) and the massages are great.  They also do brow waxes but I haven't tried that yet.  Parking is weird, there is plenty of it but virtually none in front.  They are speedy and efficient which is always nice.  Especially if you are in a rush.  The great thing too is that they have a tendency to stay late past their normal closing hours so if it's a true nail emergency you know you have a chance at getting in even if you're ten minutes after closing.

Hadn't been here since college (sadly weeeel over a decade ago).  Still as friendly and delicious as ever.  The one complaint is that the two pinball machines are broken and that I feel old when I come in.  Okay, that is two complaints and neither is about the dessert so it shouldn't affect most people.  Sometimes you just want colored sweet snow.  You can mix and match a gazillion flavors complete with sugar free options.  You can top things off with a little cream too for that extra indulgence.  Not as perfect at Hawaiian shave ice where you can get ice cream, red beans and ling hing mui powder, but for a light dessert after a heavy or super spicy meal, it's awesome.

I have no idea how the rest of the restaurant's food is.  Who cares!  I make the drive for the pie.  Especially the fruit crumb pies.  You can get them by the slice, (great with their surprisingly good coffee) or the whole pie to go.  If you get a whole pie, you can actually get a pie card, i.e. the 11th pie is free.  That is how often pie afficionados are willing to make the trek past the anthem outlets.  The best pies?  Apple and Peach by far.  I can quibble about the crust, (for the money old Marie Callendar's had the best, never mushy crust) but for the fillings, Rock Springs wins hands down.  The fruit is never smooshy, never overly sweet and the filling is not all just jello goop.  I have been known to sit down with the pie, intending to eat only one piece and go to town.  (Leaving much of the not exactly sturdy pie crust behind).  Totally worth the drive!

This place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food.  The carpet hasn't been cleaned since probably the Nixon era.  And the food is pretty standard.  That said, everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a) survived it b) been there c) surprisingly crave it.  Most people pick a, but some surprisingly pick c.  It's an old-school Phoenix thing and you have to support that!

Do not go there if you have a late afternoon client meeting.  You will be happy, but you will be oh so sleepy.  What I love about LoLo's is that they have the best lunch combinations already figured out for you....the hard part is just picking out which one.  The macaroni and cheese is just the type you want, gooey and cheesy.  The collard greens are tender with just a little bitterness and the chicken is without compare.  I care mostly about the waffles which are huge and the size of a dinner plate.  Oh and you can get red kool-aide in mason jars.  Need I say more?

This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.  A bit heavier on the salt and sauces than I would like though.  I tend to go to my old standbys Great Wall or my newer loves Nee House or South China knowadays.

Bright, no nonsense Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant.  You can get a good mix of both styles of food.  This is reminscent of many Chinese cafes you would get in Hong Kong.  I sometimes wished they had more Cantonese styled dishes, but the pho is good and they are the only place in town to get a Durian milkshake.  (Weird but oddly addicting).  The place is super clean which makes me happy, (I've had more than one squemish friend boycott my local pho place because they were a little wary).  Their spring rolls are a must.

Still one of the best.  You don't come here for ambiance or good service.  You don't come here for stellar conversation.  It's certainly not a first date place, it might not even make the first few months of dating.  But for reliable pho and bahn mi, you can beat this old school family run place.  They have the best vietnamese coffee (strong and sweet), on lucky summer days you might be able to get PennyWort juice which tastes like wheatgrass and I'm convinced cures hangovers.  The spring rolls are giant, packed with shrimp and vermicelli.  I love the crispy fried egg rolls.  The menu is expansive and the bread crispy.  Oh and most dishes cost less than $8.00 dollars.  Do you really need to know more?

This place is old school.  i.e. you don't come here for the service, or the ambiance (especially since it's in a scary part of town).  You come for the food.  Come with a group of friends, whether for dim sum or a late night dinner.  You need a group of people, I hate coming here when its just mean and three others.  I like to taste and sample lots of goodies.  They have great live seafood (a must in my book) where you can walk by and see what looks good that day.  Be brave and check it out!

Okay its pricey, but I gotta tell you when you walk in, this is how the other half lives.  It's connected to Galicia jewelers so if  you are so inclined you can pick up some baubles to go with your new updo.  Came in for a pedi, facial and hair cut.  Pedi's are pricey ($50.00) but my feet came back soft add perfectly polished.  The facials came with an excruciately painful extractions process (which I secretly enjoy) and my face is perfectly moistorized.  She even managed to do this without messing up my newly coiffed hair done by Josh.  All in all, I managed to get all this accomplished in an afternoon without having to race all over town.  The place is a compound, with different services on different floors if you're not careful you'll get lost!  Definately worth the extra cost to save time from running from place to place.

I am so not a tequila person.  (Long story involving training police officers, shots of Hornitos and throwing up on a room mate).  Point being, even margaritas can be painful for me.  Although I make an exception for this place.  I don't go often (again because of the Tequila issue) but when I do go I go all out.  The food is good, more Richardson's style than say Garcia's mexican style.  The margaritas are huge.  $10.00 for two good pours.  A fun place to go with friends and sit and catch up.  There is generally a long(ish) wait but well worth it.  It's even worth braving the tequila monster.

The food and wine are amazing.  You have to enter through a side door.  The place looks and feels like an underground cellar.  You can't go wrong ordering the cheese fondue or any number of the small bites.  I will say that I tend to avoid the nights there is a jazz band playing, it tends to get too loud for my taste.  There are lots of couples milling around, so either you'll love it or hate it.  Larger groups have a harder time being seated and I will say that there can be a line for the restrooms.

Great brunch.  Spicy Bloody Mary's.  When I want to have something spicy and just a little different I head to Cowboy Ciao's for brunch.  One complaint is that you have to pay extra for the slipper bread.  It is so delicious, it'd be a nice touch if they put it on the table.  The Stetson Chopped Salad is a famous dish, as is the mushroom and polenta.  It is a little "Scottsdale" but the food makes up for it.  Now that the bridge is open, it would be nice to head out there and then a quick stroll on the bridge.  Oh, the mac and cheese is also delicious!  The drinks are good (especially since it is also owned by Kasimeriz) but the desserts are bit weak.

Wanted to like the place.  So many people seem to rave about it.  Admittedly I was doing take out and didn't get the full perspective but ordered pad thai and nother beef with broad noodle dish and was underwhelemed.  I know that it is "asian fusian" but the menu was mostly Thai with some sushi thrown in for good measure.  I gave the hostess my order and waited at the bar.  There was no service at the bar save for some water.  no on came by to check on me despite telling someone that i wanted a beer and some edamame to snack on while I waited.  I got the order home and it was piping hot which is usually a good sign.  i was a little disappointed that the boxes had leaked and there was a bit of a mess coming out but the food was well, bland.  i had asked for medium spicy and got ho-hum spicy on both noodle dishes.  The noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The proteins were tough.  they tasted as if they had been blanched and then thrown in to warm with the already overcooked noodles.  I had ordered a chicken corn soup which had good flavor but more of that overcooked chicken and absolutely no corn.  it looked like egg drop soup that I could have made in my sleep.  not a huge fan :(

One of my old-school stand out favorites.  Have been coming here for at least 10 years if not more.  The owner is always there and friendly.  (Always thanks you for coming in no less).  For lunch they have amazing bento box lunches for under 6.00 dollars.  If you crave teppan, they have old school teppan dinners where you can see your food aflame and cooked for you.  If it were closer to downtown Phoenix I would be parked here.  I like to see that it refuses to change as the rest of Scottsdale becomes trendier....I love that it hasn't changed and that the quality of food and service is still great.   For dinner its going to be old-school, i.e. not trendy and nothing challenging.  This place did have its heydey about ten years ago, but that said, its comforting and good.

Gotta tell ya, I love this place.  The girls are friendly, have amazing skills with a hula hoop and the crowd leaves you alone.  The only downside is the cash only policy.  The drinks are strong and big (although they aren't the cheapest).  I want to go back on one of the theme nights (poker night, t-shirt contest night) etc.  They have great movies playing behind the bar. The crowd is a mixed crowd. Much better than old town.  This is authentic and genuine.  This is a bar that locals go to.  If only it were closer....

Great place for when you want to enjoy desert views and outdoor seating.  The food is nothing too challenging, southwestern takes on american favorites.  (Chops, chicken etc).  The desserts are a little weak here, but the meal overall can be magical.  A little coffee outside enjoying the stars will more than make up for it.  It is romantic and beautiful, perfect for a fancy 2nd date.  (I'm sighing as I write about it) Brunch is equally classy and relaxed.  It would be nice for a relaxed (but special occasion) brunch.

In all fairness and in the interest of full disclosure, I am not a climber.  I am reviewing this strictly from a bytander's viewpoint, i.e. if you were a soccer mom bringing your kids to this place.  Came in to observe the boyfriend and another friend climb.  The staff is friendly and seem to know what they are doing.  If you had kids I'm not sure how the supervision would really be.  They are nice to provide at least some chairs for folks who are not climbing.  The place is clean enough, although like all rock gyms I'm sure, it smells like boy sweat and exercise.  A combination I'm not particularly fond of.  Went on a Tuesday and it was busy.  This seems to be a very popular spot.  There are a ton of walls and each wall has varying degrees of difficulty which is good for climbers of all levels.  The best part for me at least is that it is next to Republic Ramen and a Karaoke bar.  Perfect if you aren't doing the climbing :)

The cesar salad is very very addictive.  The food is pricey, but a nice evening under the stars and the patio will make you forget any care you have in the world. I like this place for dinner more than lunch.  It's worth going to for special occasions.

One of the best places on Mill Avenue.  Sophisticated food using local ingredients.  From the bread to the dessert, you will not be disappointed.  It's a good place for a business lunch or a romantic dinner.  The specials are worth trying no matter they are.

The owners of this restaurant used to own Lucky's Chinese.  This is the place you would go to for Sochow style fried tofu.  Crispy on the outside, a little bit of shrimp paste and the inside piping hot and soft.  Literally unmatched by anywhere else.  The restaurant is small and service is quick.  Lots of the menu is written only in Chinese on specials on white boards.  If you have access to someone who reads Chinese, this is the time to bring them.  Food is not meant to be fussy or fancy.  This is the type of food that many Cantonese families would make for themselves during the week.  They will let you bring in seafood and they will cook it for you for a small service charge.  Totally worth it.  Even if you don't bring in seafood, the mussels are to die ford as well as any shrimp dish.  I make the drive out here and ignore the fact that it's next to a scary massage place and quincenara store.  Give it a go, worth your time. Not to miss dishes Stir fried freshwater vegetables Duck braised with taro Suzhou style fried tofu Braised Beef bowl (sacha flavored beef with vermicelli noodles) salt and pepper shrimp

Again, I hate lines.  I've stood in line here right at 5 o'clock just to be beaten out by some folks who clearly had the day off.  Even with that gripe, I love this place.  I just don't come often.  I really do save this place for out of towners who have read that this is the best pizza in America.  (I have friends from Connecticut who argue with me on this one) but is Oprah ever wrong?  There is a bar next door where they get you good and shnockered before your meal.  The bread is delicious as are the salads, but who are you kidding?  You came for the pizza.  My favorite features arugula.  Everyone else seems to love the meat laden one.  But if you snag a table, be smart, order lots of pizza.  Everyone likes pizza even when it's cold the next day.  If you get a group of people together it's actually doable as they will take a reservation.

The drinks were good, but the atmosphere was well...bleak.  Didn't order food, just bellied up to the bar.  The bar tender was okay, not particularly friendly for Vegas (although to be fair, I was a bit overserved at this point and probably a little surly myself).  I just recall looking around thinking that we came for the kitsch value, the kitsche was supposed to be in the form of a Lenin bust, but apparently they've removed it from the outside.  Otherwise, the red menus not withstanding, there is nothing interesting or exciting about this place.  Maybe they were staying a little "too true to its theme"?

My new favorite brunch.  Owner is from Singapore and the staff all seem to speak either Cantonese or Mandarin.  Food is decadent but nicely proportioned.  You can get a taste of many things without feeling bad that a ton of food is going to waste.  Omlette bar is a waste of space in my opinion, but the dim sum, the congee, the noodles, the sushi, the raw bar, the sliced brunch offerings....I can go on and on.  There is a separate room just for dessert.  The dessert room has your standard chocolate fountain but the strawberries were as big as my fist.  There is an attendant just to scoop ice cream and sorbets.  There are mountains of truffles and fruit pates also. Not to be missed:  chicken congee, braised shortribs, thick cut maple bacon, truffle carpaccio cones, sushi, oysters.   It is pricey.  Two buffets, two cocktails and a pot of tea came out to about $160.00 This is not a place you can get into easily without a reservation.  The views of the fountains are amazing and you don't feel hurried or rushed out.  Overall, I'd go back again soon.  It's taken the place of my old standbys of Wynn or French Market bistro.   I hear the dinner service will be delicious and may try that.  I had a wonderful time and found the service to be kind and attentive without overly intrusive  (not that I'd ever be upset at anyone doing a tableside peking duck carving for me).  Even the China food is served on is elegant.  Make some money at the tables and come here.

This place is an oldie but goodie.  Not the trendiest restaurant (any more).  Back in the day, the placement of the bathrooms and the fact that the DJ was on the second floor spinning was mind blowing!  Now it is populated more by folks who were walking around the mall and wanted a place to eat.  This is not a bad thing at all. I used to feel like I have dress to the nines to come here.  Now I don't get as stressed coming in.  The drinks are still great.  Strong and well executed.  Don't miss the Pimms Cup by the way.  Only Hanny's does a similar one and I think Az 88 executes it better.  They have mini hot fudge sundaes which make me super happy.  The food is standard and filling.  Overall, I think I might need to put this back in the rotation.

Is this place the most awesome place in Vegas.  No.  But it does provide great people watching (right inside the Hard Rock casino off the strip) and cheap prices.  The gamblers special is 7.77 for steak and shrimp. You can get steak and eggs for like 5.99.  The meals come with a salad, nothing super exciting here but again, if you want cheap steak and eggs, you can come here and not have to brave the truly scary places.  Go only late at night and go only in need of food after hitting the table.s  We came here for our first meal after making the drive in, and it satisfied, but I have a feeling it would've have been even better after we were a smidge more bleary eyed.  I will say too as a word of warning, like many places in Vegas, the drinks are really really expensive and not that great.  Stick with the food!

The original hoity toity burger place.  Smallish portions but the burger is so good!  Quality protein done well.  Good french fries (you can do a mix with sweet potato if you like).  Shakes are thick and good.  I know that folks aren't happy with the smaller portions, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise with our ever expanding girths :)  Still a great place to come to and they are consistently open late!  A huge plus in Phoenix.  Still hugely busy and sometimes hard to get a table if you are with a huge group.

Good, but a litte sweet.  It's a nice place to gather (especially after a meal at Delux).  The servings are the right size but a little pricey for my taste.  A lot of offerings, nice balance of creamy ones versus fruit ones.  They will give you a taste test of any of them.  The flavors are intense but sometimes can be a little gummy.  Again, delicious but I wished it was less sugary.

Love the ambiance.  Good for groups or casual dates. The salads and sandwiches are okay, the pizza is good.  (Although I will say that it does not hold up well for leftovers, it tends to get really mushy).  I really like the cheese plate and it has a good selection of beers.  Plus they have a homemade Limencello that is perfect for a digestif.  The dessert crepes are really good and perfect for sharing.  For really big groups you can ask for the carriage house.  Instead of waiting for Pizzeria Bianco this is a quick compromise.  Can't say it's as good, but when the pizza is piping hot, it can make a gal pretty happy!

Fez:  Delicious and garlicky.  I will say that service is not the best.  They try but always seem to be understaffed.  Good happy hour specials, sometimes parking can be a bear.  Good music and good ambiance.  Their hummus is great, great vegetarian burger and I almost always get the fez salad with either shrimp or gyro.  Worth a try and off of the light rail!  Oh and the sweet potato fries are so delicious!  They are like candy!.

This is a solid buffet.  It is not the cheapest, but for $15.00 you can add a champagne "bump" which means refills on mimosas, champagne or bloody mary's.  The service is decent, but not great.  i.e. you may average about three to four re-fills.  Lots of Asian folks digging into the crab legs like all buffets.  The sorbet/gelato is great (especially the coconut), the rest of the desserts are good not great.  The main entree selections are great as are the salad and sushi.  I will say however that this still doesn't rival my favorite buffet (the one at Paris).  The food is fresh (a must) but not as well seasoned as I would like.  The lines are long, be prepared to wait a bit.  Still, it is better than some of the older buffets now and if you dont' want to battle people at the newest buffets, it is still a solid contender.

Let me start by saying I hate waiting in line.  If I could, I would get an intern just to wait in line for me.  Having said that, I have waiting in line more than once for breakfast here.  The food is delicious.  I'm not sure if its the copious amounts of butter in the food but I swear it is the best toast and breakfast potatoes in town.  Oh and the main dishes are great too.  The place is tiny, and they really didn't spend much money on decor.  But really, who cares when breakfast is this delicious?!

Really delicious.  Not your typical Mexican fare.  I love that you can actually get huetlacoche, not that many places actually carry it.  The guacamole is freshly made and there is attention to detail here.  They will accomodate minor changes but I usually don't finding myself needing to.  The chess pie by the way is really tasty for dessert if you still have room.

Nothing here that will make your tongue tingle with spice.  However I'm updating my update simply to rave about the crossaint bread pudding.  Oh my goodnes, is this incredible.  I love bread pudding and bread pudding made from crossaints is beyond decadent.  (For those of you who visit Luci's try the Wicked Bread pudding which is a great take hom option).  This time I made a meal of small starters.  Scallops were delicious in a bed of quinoa salad (could have used a little more oomph on the salad but good).  The green chili mac and cheese is delicious although I would have preferred more spice.  The huitlacoche quesadillas are delcious and filling.  Overall, a solid four stars.

New update:  Carly's has become my to go lunch place away from downtown.  I've gotten really sick of eating at the Butcher (The arrogant butcher that is) and now I like coming here for a pannini or salad.  The orzo salad always needs a bit more salt, but if you get a side of their really tasty balsamic vinagrette (which tastes good on basically everything) you'll be fine.  Oh, I also always order the pannini on focaccia rather than the ciabatta as the ciabatta can get a little too hard or overcrisped for my taste.  For brunch, its still meh.

Of the Fox restaurants, I think this is one of my favorites.  Lots of fresh seasonal ingrediants and sea food.  the interior is beautifully decorated, regardless if you eat at a table or at the bar, you will get the same attentive service.  A must try if you are in North Scottsdale.

Come hungry.  The plates are big and full of tasty goodness.  I like to share with friends if possible.  The food is spicy but not so spicy that I find it overwhelming.  Most items comes drizzled with a bit of crema which makes me happy.  They have items like duck enchiladas which you won't find just anywhere.   Plus their drinks are top notch without being too sweet.

For folks who like to cocktail, this place is awesome.  Everyone talks about how great the juke box is, how there are good movies playing in the background, how sometimes a food truck is located conveniently in the parking lot.  I write because the bartenders are awesome.  These are guys who make their own mix for Tom and Jerry's.  They will make a hot buttered rum from scratch.  They pour a mean Manhatten and something called a flying squirrel that will sneak up behind you with an order of protection.  In short, this place is heaven and hopefully not too many places rush over there displacing my place at the bar.

This may even supplant my old favorite, Fattoush for gyros and family style plates. Family owned, it will not take much before they great you the customer, like family.  The portions are extremely generous.  Most dishes are served with a rice pilaf which is studded with almonds and golden raisons.  The garlic dip (which you sometimes have to ask for if it doesn't come with your dish) is heavenly.  You will breath garlic for days but it is worth it.  The gyros are sliced very thin so you get to experience the flavor with a different texture than the type you usually get.  The shish kebabs are moist and have one of the best combinations of char to flavor.  It is next to Nee House (home of some of the best Chinese food in town).  So now it turns into a battle in the parking lot.  Chinese, or Kebab's tonight?  Note:  The restaurant is very small.  I would not attempt anything larger than a group of four :)

Somewhere between and two and a three.  The food is not good.  There is a happy hour and a reverse happy hour.  the price points are good.  $6.00 dollar drinks, $5.00 apps.  Problem is, nothing tastes very good.  the presentation is beautiful.  the restaurant is beautiful.  there is even a live band that is pretty good (except everything sounds like dave matthews), its just that the food is made to be non-offensive.  the salad with green goddess dressing, tastes like iceberg with mayonnaise.  the fried calamari is crispy but needs some realy dipping sauce other than the same green goddess type dressing.  The char siu bao is just gross.  The burger is decent and comes with some sweet potato fries.  had some duck cubes that were just cubes of protein that looked like they were dipped in hoisin sauce.  the desserts and tiki drinks fared better.  Stick with Maitais or hot buttered rum.  All of the drinks are sweet concoctions, but they claim to have invented the Mai Tai, and the hot buttered rum comes in a fun tiki glass. the desserts however were great.  Pineapple upside down cake, Snowall (vailla icecream, coconut shavings and chocolate sauce) and bread pudding were all top notch.  Took us $60.00 bucks to get out of there for two for happy hour so it still adds up.  hit or miss, better off going to Hulas.

It was late, i was slightly buzzed, and I was super hungry. I know that the late night choices were going to be limited, Denny's. pizza, tace bell.  Nothing appealed, and then by accident I discovered you can get fried macaroni and cheese.  From the outside (and the inside) it's not an impressive place.  The menu has items spelled out in old school letters.  standard items like sandwiches and philly cheesesteak.  had a friend not accidentally ordered macaroni and cheese (expecting a styrofoam cup of orange stuff) I never would have known about the heavingly triangle of food known as the fried macaroni and cheese triangle.  It is a small wedge of a triangle served piping hot in a non-descript paper bag.  Bite into one and it is pure bliss.  Warm, cheesy, oozy macaroni and cheese in a convenient finger safe food that is perfect for the ride home.  I have found my new vice.

This is a great place for grilled cheese and tomato soup.  They also have a great selection of beers on tap.  Parking is hit or miss, but you can't miss a cute house that has been converted to a great gastropub.  Always a friendly face and you will always run into good folks.

Everyone raves about the macarons.  Which are delicious (if a little sweet) but I rave about the croissants.  In particular the almond croissants.  No matter what the time of day, if you can pop into this very charming cafe and grab something from the counter you definately should.  The macarons are great with a good coffee otherwise check out any number of their other baked goods.

One of the original gastro-pubs in Arizona.  Great beer, and even better food.  Can't say I'm a fan of the dessert pastys but the everything else is amazing.  You can get traditional ones such as shepard's pie, oggies etc. or you can tikka masala which is amazing.  The place is small and you have to be okay with having heavily tattooed/pierced servers wait on you.  The place is small, but comfortable.  I'd be happier if the music was more English but other than that I have no complaints!  Plus the pictures of coal miners are a bit depressing.   Due to seating constraints, I wouldn't recommend large groups, I'd say mostly two or three at the most.

Ignore the fact that it is in a strip mall.  (You live in Az, everything is in a strip mall).  Inside is a magical land of Japanese food unlike most in town.  It is not limited to sushi, there are robata style nibbles perfect for eating with copious amounts of sake or green tea.  The chef's features are the best bet.  When I come, I don't even order sushi unless someone insists.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  This is one of the first places to try the izakaya style (props to them for doing this even before Nobu tried with Teeter House).

Hidden next to a dance studio, this is an absolutely adorable gem of a place.  The food is a both sweet and spicy.  The cornbread casserole is something that I dream about.  Portions are big and the service is always friendly.  I almost don't want to share how much I love this place :)  The drinks are strong without being too boozy.  Have never had a bad meal here.

Love love love this boutique.  Unique gifts (that aren't cheesy like Urban Outfitters) and cute clothes.  A little pricey, but for the mix and the quality, its got a great collection.  The cards, magnets, and magazines are some of the best I've seen.  A huge fan.  Wish we had more downtown boutiques like this.   I hate having to drive all over the place for unique gifts for both my guys and gals.  This place solves all the problems!

Everytime I come here, I feel that I am transported to a restaurant in a different city.  The meals here are delicious but the quality over the years appears to have diminished somewhat.  My favorite is still the creamed corn, no matter what I order off the menu, I always get a side of creamed corn.  The rest of the menu is solid.  I tend to bring clients and out of town guests here.  For my day to day cravings, the meals are a little too heavy but for an occassional treat its not a bad bet.

I generally don't venture out of my ten mile radius rule.  But for sushi ken, I am happy to get into the car and venture out to Chandler.  I've already been familiar with this restaurant since it was in Tucson.  Nothing much has changed.  Friendly (leisurely) service, solid mom and pop Japanese food.  Good prices, good amount of food.  Some of my favorites are the ramen, the korroke curry, and oyako donburi.  Nothing fancy, just delicious.

Urban cookies and Ollicakes cupcakes are my go-to spot for when I need to brighten someone's day.  I will say that my favorite cupcake flavors are the orangeblossom, coconut and german chocolate.  Strawberry buttercream is pretty darn tasty too.  The cookies don't ever disappoint.  Sweet without being cloying, flavor packed and pretty to boot.  Bonus, they are open until at least six and that makes my run home a lot sweeter!

Do not come here expecting fancy table cloths and gleaming tables.  Much like my other go to Chinese Restaruants (Great Wall, the revamped South China and Nee House) this is a no frills Cantonese Style restaurant that has recipes and tastes best suited to my father's palate (in case you are wondering he is 70+ years old and from the mother-land).  i.e. What you get here is family style homey Cantonese cooking.  Lots of fresh vegetables and dishes that I grew up eating.  They do an excellent fried tofu.  The owners of this place use to own the revered Lucky's Chinese Restaurant which I have fond memories of from the early 90s.  They have family style dinners as well as regular menus you can order off of.  There is nothing overly priced on the menu and they even have harder to source dishes involving lamb and seafood.  I don't see live seafood tanks here, although I'm told that they are willing to cook seafood that you bring in yourself.  (A bonus for many Chinese folks who want a specific type of fish, but don't want to have to cook it themselves).  A solid place (I wish it were a smidge closer to Central Phoenix) and like all good restaurants, tucked in the corner of a non-descript strip mall.  True Cantonese cooking, i.e. this is not Northern Style or Sichuan style chinese cooking.  For those of you familiar with the different you'll know what I'm talking about.  They even have old school 80s pop music from Hong Kong playing the background.  Oh and the service is spotty.  Just like I remember....

Love mom and pop restaurants.  The food is really great. Service can be slow but its totally worth it.  Have not had anything bad on the menu.  If you're not sure what you want, try just a simple pita.  It's inexpensive and filling.  Save room for baklava!

One of the few Chinese places I actually like to eat at.  The portions are not the most generous, but they are prepared with thought and care.  It's not the prettiest place, (but what chinese place really is).  It is clean and airy.  Best if you can go with a large group of friends and split a big meal. As usual it is in a strip mall, but overall, great food in a so so location.

Great seafood tower and creme brulee.  Oh yeah the steaks are good too.  What I like about this place is that they take the time to learn your name and are attentive without being overly intrusive.  If you have to impress a small business group you can reserve the wine room.  They will work with you to create a special menu and you will leave feeling like a VIP.

Best sticky toffee pudding ever.  But before I jump to dessert may I say that this restaurant is a feast for the eyes as well as for a hungry belly.  The bread and olive oil is a good way to start.  The polenta is delicious, I've had their carrot soup and its just spicy and warm enough with ginger undertones.  I'm not a huge fan of the flat breads but that has more to do with flat breads in general and not a knock on them.  The goat cheese appetizer comes in a crock with tomatoes, pine nuts and olive oil.  I almost always get the salmon on a bed on quinua salad.  And then, back to the sticky toffee pudding.  I dream about this stuff.  Warm, a little bit of chew and a sweet butterscotch/toffee flavor.   If you come during happy hour, there are often nice nibbles to go around also.  All in all, delicious and pretty.  If the weather is nice I like to sit at the front bar, or on the back patio next to the fire place.

Parking can be rough here, and during busy times, good luck getting a table.  But your patience will be rewarded.  The sushi specials (on the wipe board) are never to be missed.  The regular menu is filled with flavorful and recognizable dishes but Hana does thing their own way, it is always delicious without being tedious.  A definate must.

Hand's down one of the best Apple Pies in town.  I've never actually eaten the sandwiches which appear interesting and delicious (clearly freshly made).  I generally run in here for a quick sugar pick me up back to the office.  The large display case will showcase large slices of cake, cupcakes and pie.  They are also selling mini-cupcakes in case you are feeling guilty about the sugar/fat thing.  I've never had a baked good here that wasn't delicious.  But seriously, try the pie.  A great mix of apples, cinamon and somehow the crust stays crispy without that weird feeling that you are ingesting too much shortening (which is my love/hate/complaint issue with Marie Callendar's pies).  Yummy goodness and you can get it by the slice.  A slice of heaven for about four bucks.  A better use of my lottery money than usual.

I think I'm the only person who doesn't like these.  I think Sprinkles is way too sweet and sometimes too dry.  The flavors are good but the execution is weak.  Plus they are expensive.

Switch is like the younger sibling to the Fez/Ticoz empire.  I know it's there, I drive by it, I just never think to eat there.  The food is reliable for lunch.  Sandwiches and salads. Nothing that will be over spiced or too crazy.  It is very crowded for lunch.  The service can be a little hit or miss.  Sometimes I can get in super fast and sometimes its the wait.  So it's not the waitstaff that is to blame, just luck of the draw.  I usually get a salad which is plenty of food or a sandwich.  If you are feeling naughty you can get the mac and cheese or one of their gallettes (which are basically phyllo dough pockets).  Have not had brunch there yet, although I hear it is good.  They also have tempting cookies right by the front door in case you need to grab a quick sugar rush on the way out.

Great corporate gift.  Are they healthy?  Of course not.  But they hold well and are individually wrapped.  You can get them in bite sized, sprite (half brownies) or full sized.  I find the full sized much too large, the sprites are great, or even the brownie bits.  Oh and if you can get your hands on it, the chocolate fudge sauce makes the best chocolate fondue or drizzling sauce for desserts.  I've only done the mail order I've never been to the storefront, but they've always made it to the destination on time and with a gift card.  My clients are always happy to get a gift from fairytale.

Good fast lunch specials.  Reliable friendly service.  I do wish it was a bit more customized.  i.e. you sit down, everyone gets the eggrolls and soup.  etc etc.  But overral for a fast lunch (not nearly as fancy as Wile Thaiger or even Thai Basil) you can't go wrong.  This is a good casual lunch space for co-workers.  I wouldn't try taking any clients to this place as it still looks like an old diner, complete with vinyl booths for lunch under 8 dollars it's a great place.

Pricey but worth it. They have cucumber water, and some of the best carrot raison cookies laid out (which they swear is not that unhealthy for you).  There is a hot water spa with a cold water pool right near by.  I had the mud wrap which was nice but my friends tell me the massage is the way to go.

Come hungry.  Really hungry.   The fact that Adam of Man v. Food fame came here to eat should tell you something.  You can feed an entire family of four for like 20 bucks.  The tortas are loaded with protein and even come with lays ruffle potato chips.  They have ceviche tostadas and bebidas liquidos (mango is an all time fave) but you can get something that is healthier involving beets and vegetables which looks cool but tastes like sweetened v8.  It is super busy, happy families, hungry locals, a tv in the corner that is usually playing soccer or some variety show.  Old School Phoenix.

The advent of on-line tunes means that record stores are a dying breed.  For some reason record stores always have that same smell, part good will, part social consciousness, part smugness.  I for one, hope that record stores don't all disappear.  Good mix of music.  Mostly used items, but lots and lots of vinyl.  Plus they always play great music to shop to.  It's across the street from Carly's so its a great place to attempt to walk off some brunch on the weekend on nice days.

Finally Finally went after all these years and all the hype. Met some friends for happy hour.  The pros:  Cheap beer.  Beer is 2 for 1, which amounts to 2.50 cents per Asahi.  Having said that, ate off the happy hour menu. Perhaps the dinner menu is better, but the happy hour menu sounded delicious so we sat in the lounge. The lounge is pretty, good view of this wine wall (which is where they hide the very pretty bathrooms).  The staff is pretty, some are very nice, others a bit cold. The menu had all sorts of exciting sounding appetizers.  Kobe beef gyoza, (fatty tasting but not in a great way, tasted like the filling in an okay egg-roll), soft shell crab buns, good, but not for the price.  The kimchee noodles with duck breast were passable, but nothing to write home about.  Was told that the scallop sushi roll was "the best roll" that the restaurant makes.  It was....okay.  Had edmame, had the pork belly.  Most everythign on the menu, both salty and not involved ponzu sauce. I love ponzu but it seemed to be in everything.  The seafood salad was a good mix of sashimi peices, but microscopic in size. Ordered desserts, pretty presentation, but nothing spectacular.  The one dish I really liked was the butterfish tataki with ponzu sauce.  Problem is, we were served five nearly transparent (as in small) pieces of fish about the size of two postage stamps apiece.  Tasty but dissapointingly small.  The bill for four folks (who didn't eat all that much and barely drank the happy hour beer) was about 175.00 I don't mind spending money when its tasty, (for a better place with a more intimate feel, stop by Teeter House downtown, better food, better preparation.   The bill pained me as the food was mediocre.

Meh:  Go there because work is near by.  I think the food is over priced but dependable.  The pastas are the best best or the sandwich by itself.  Don't make the mistake of ordering a side of pasta which will net you a smallish cup (amounting to two forkfulls of pasta) for like four bucks.  Okay for a quick work bite.

Due to my goof (okay, I admit I was late to try and grab a table at Bianco's and the wait ended up being 3+ hours, we had time to kill.  The food at the bar next to Bianco's wasn't going to cut it, especially with two hungry boys in tow.  We decided to pop on over to Rose and Crown for a few beers and some cheesy fries.  One of the beers ended up being only 25 cents due to the fact that our friend's last name began with a "D", they run this special and change the last name often so that it always is a random surprise.  Another great thing, we went on a Wednesday night and it was team trivia night.  While we didn't do so hot on the trivia, the beers and fun made the way for Bianco's fly by. The food is pub food and we didn't want to fill up so we got some cheese fries mostly to soak up some of the Boddingtons.  Overall, it helped to contribute to a great night and helped put folks in a better mood to overlook my mess up on Bianco's.

Came in a few times before and ordered drinks with dinner.  The trick to liking this place is to order drinks at the counter.  That was you get to see the giant hunk of ginger, see the bar tenders squeezing limes, watch them actuallly muddle drinks with care.  The drinks are good, but the show, even better.

One of the best Pho places in the East Valley.  They are generous with the portions, and the proteins are excellent quality.  I almost always get vermicilli noodles with grilled beef or pork and if I've been a good girl i'll top it off with some fried egg rolls.  The spring rolls come with a little too much bean sprout, but minor quibble.  Now if only they'd move a little closer....

Love Love Love this place.  I'll confess that I'm a little lazy and do not make the drive to the store front in North Scottsdale.  I've only been to the mobile food truck staffed by the owner herself who is so pleasant and kind.  The flavors are amazing.  You sense the care and time that goes into steeping quality ingrediants into the custard base.  Nothing is ever too "heavy" my complaint about ice creams like Cold Stone, where you are eating the equivalent of frozen lard.  There is a nice balance between the cream and the milk.  I've had the tea flavored ice creams (Chai is not too be missed, Jasmine is little too subtle, green tea divine) to salted caramel which is heavenly.  Madagascar Vanilla will make you rethink about calling anyone boring as "vanilla".  The one flavor that is a little too intense for me is the Lavender Honey.  Not quite enough honey, and a little too much Lavendar but that could have been that day.  Overall, you have to give it a try.  Not the cheapest place, but you are supporting a true master of her craft.

The first time I came here I was dissapointed.  I thought it was too hoity, too pretend fancy.  I've subsequently been here at least ten other times and have been so taken with the food that I think this is the best place to come when I want a relaxed deconstructed meal.  The flavors are all there, but the presentation and use of ingrediants is always surprising and a delight.  Everything from the bread to the dessert is amazing.  I will say that you'll have to spend a bit, but it is worth every penny.  The restaurant is airy on the inside, even though it is in the same parking lot as a Safeway next to a nail shop.  But once inside, you'll think you are in a restaurant in California, like a mini vacation!

Have never had a bad meal here.  Full wine list that covers a large variety of wines.  Regardless if you choose to have the full experience in the back room or to just relax at the bar, you are treated like family.  Christopher himself will walk by and chat with you to ensure that you are having a good time.  Reliable and delicious! Pizzas are all good (although I will admit I'm not a huge fan of blood sausage).  The tempura battered bacon served with fois gras is to die for.  Truffled fried or duck fat fries make you forget the day.  And I've never had scallops quite as decadent as ones dusted in vanilla powder.  Never a bad meal!

Just went again last night with friend's from out of town.  Here's what we ordered:  Heirloom tomato flatbread, duck confit/humboldt fog salad, beet and burrata salad, leek soup garnished with truffle oil, mac and cheese, hanger steak, side of veg, vegetable risotto.  Christopher sent out some smoked salmon spoons and a dessert plate that was to die for.  My friends all agree that this is the place to be for special occasions.  Had a delicious white burgandy and champagne to boot!

Just writing reconfirm the excellence of the waitstaff and menu.  The menu is varied enough to encompass diners not as familiar with traditional French cuisine but does not stray too far from the path for traditionalists.  This is one of the few restaurants where the named Chef is in nearly every night ensuring quality control and consistency.  Chef Gross cares deeply about his suppliers and the training of staff.  The attention to detail shows.  For those in need of a private party, the restaurant works with you to craft the menu and personalize the event so that your guests are left wowed by the experience.  I do not hesitate to bring my most discerning of business guests here.  For less formal needs the bar area is cozy and perfect for a get together with close friends.

Blech.  Had the fish tacos, they tasted of fish that had been bottom feeders that had been frozen, thawed, refrozen and then thawed again before cooking.  i.e. mushy and not the best.  They were cheap though....

Delicious.  Some of the best hanger steak and pommes frites.  Some of the best desserts around with the beignents and creme brulee.  The one thing I don't like is the truffled ice cream.  That was a bit much even for me.  Barring that, everything else was delicious and not a bad price point.

I really like this place.  I can come, order an appetizer and an entree and not feel guilty.  Warning, the desserts here aren't great.  The juices and waters are tasty but a bit expensive for the sizes.  It's basically spa food, but slightly larger portions.  The hummus is delicious.  I generally order the kale or the quinoia salad.  I also love the farrow which is cooked with black figs and is salty and sweet.  The edamame dumplins are raved about by others, but I find them too salty.  For the love of god, stay away from the flat bread pizzas.  They taste horrible.  Other than that, the rest of the menu is tasty and healthy.

Updating my review only to say that the crudite is amazing.  For 11 dollars I know some people will gripe that you are getting raw vegetables, but you have to understand it is a giant, artfully constructed ice cold bowl of fresh, organic vegetables served with tzatziki and olive tapenade for dipping.  Even as cheap as I am, I will lovingly order the crudite appetizer now.  Oh and top it off with some edamame dumplings if you are feeling indulgent.

Located in the Zam Zam food market, this is a great Pakistani restaurant, for those wanting some of the flavors of India (so that it is somewhat familiar to you) but the sauces are still different and a good change of pace.  The breads here are amazing, as are the chickpeas. If you like goat, you will actually find it on the menu.  Don't be scared by the oiliness of the food, you just eat around it.  You will be surprised that you don't actually fall into immediate food coma after eating.  The mango lassi is of course a must! Ignore the fact that there is no ambiance.  You are sitting in booths in the back of an ethnic market afterall :)

Great place to grab a quick coffee or bite, but also a great place for breakfast.  The oatmeal here is almost as good as Taylor's Cafe but the omelettes are pretty tasty and come with a sweet potato hash that I wish more places would serve.  The good news is that if you are here just for coffee, the pastry case is better than at any Starbucks.  You can also wander around the store and get some other groceries.  (Its not the cheapest, think Whole Foods) but it does feel like a great neighborhood place.  Parking is not great though, so be forewarned, carpool if you can!

Is it wrong to covet guacamole at odd hours?  I almost always order guacamole (which somehow always tastes better than my own) and a 1/2 salad 1/2 torta combo.  Usually the kortada salad but they have a new one with pomegranate seeds and blue cheese.  The blue cheese didn't add much to the flavor mix for me but the salad itself is delicious.  The tortas are always good, I usually go for fish and the selection does vary.  Most times it's white fish lightly grilled (but highly seasoned) but yesterday I got lucky and got ahi tuna of all things.  A fotuitous and lucky surprise! I love the Clarendon hotel, I'm glad to see that this restaurant is sticking around.  The place had a hard time getting a restaurant to stick for awhile and this one appears to be a winner.

Love this place.  So few dance clubs are still around that I don't feel like I'll be shot at.  Now that Devil's Martini is closed, there aren't too many places to get your dance on.  It helps if you are a fan of country music.  They serve beer in mason jars and I think men still hold doors open for women here.  If you are a lady, you're in for a treat.  Most of the guys can really dance.  I mean, actually lead you by the hand and dance and twirl and actually make you feel graceful.  All of the sudden all of those country love songs start to make sense :)  That being said, I never feel creepy or put upon (not something I can say with regards to most dance clubs).  Late, late in the evening, the music may get interspersed with some top 40.  But overall, I come here for the fun and dancing, I haven't had the food because its the rare place where I actually don't even think about food when I enter the door!

I come here for the tator tots.  There are too many televisions for my taste.  The food is solid and the beer is cheap.  I do find the children's play area (while helpful if I had children) a little distracting and it makes me feel guilty, sitting there with a beer while a child is playing video games. There is a guitar player on certain nights outside who is from Tucson and super friendly.  The food is not your standard bar fare, I'd call it bar fare but tastier, thus actually justifying the extra 1.50 you're paying.  And again, did i mention the tator tots?  They have sweet potato tator tots.  The hummus however is weird, I'd stay away from that stuff.

Delicious Pizza.  I love the starters, the aroncino (rice balls with mozzarella and tomato sauce) are enough to make me swoon.  I love the interier design of this place.  It is genearally super busy and if you haven't been there before it's easy to miss from the street.  The salads are big enough to share and it makes grabbing a pizza a fun experience.  (without the wait of other ahem...pizza places)

Mom and Pop place that is delicious.  A fan of their drunken noodles.  They will ask you hot spicy you want your curries.  If you brave good for the spice, you can always quence your thirst with a Thai tea.  The Satays are delicious and the portions of all meals are plentiful.  I usually have enough for anotehr meal.  The decor is nice but they do have these oddly large tables.  Go with a big group and order lots!  They also have lunch specials which are really reasonable.

Modern Steak is the steak house for ladies who lunch.  The color scheme is pretty with mirrors and chandeliers everywhere.  As you would expect from a Sam Fox creation, the menu is innovative yet familiar feeling.  There's nothing here that will challenge a true foodie, but the food is a good mix of steakhouse with salads.  The potted lobster is divine as is the steak carpaccio.  The night we went, the rib eye was well marbeled and delectable.  (The price was a little steep, but then again, you are next to Barneys).  The desserts are much too sweet.  Plan on sharing if you must indulge.  You might be better off finishing the meal with a glass of ice wine or port instead.  (One of the very few restaurants I've seen to offer Vidal ice wine on its menu).  The bar in the front portion of the restaurant is also very pretty.  It caters to a group of business types and the drinks are pretty standard.  Overall, I'd give this place a four.  It's like a more expensive version of Arrogant Butcher.

One of my favorite brunch places.  (More so than dinner) For brunch the spicy bloody mary's are the best way to start.  They have a great ricotta french french toast.  If you have a hankering for dessert, they have tableside smores which you don't find anywhere else. After brunch you can stroll the grounds and enjoy the beautiful weather.  They have a great happy hour where you can get $5.00 drinks and $5.00 small plates and nibbles.  Overall, can't go wrong, one of the better resort restaurants.

Busy Busy Busy.  Definately a place you need to call ahead and get a reservation for.  Was seated right in front of the kitchen and got a birds eye view of the goodies as they were being made.  Had the fried green tomatoes which were delicious.  Chickpeas were not really my thing, fried but a bit dry.  Jidori Chicken with polenta croutons was addictive.  The sauce, the buttery and fried polenta cubes.  I had to remember that I was in public and it was inappropriate to lick the plate clean.  The fingerling potatoes which are called "fat, fat potatoes" are delicious but nothing that I couldn't make at home.  The leeks are indeed delicious.  The menu is great for sharing, and in fact I think sharing is the way to go.  The restaurant was kind enough to send out a potato soup that was dressed with truffle oil and shaved black truffles.  That in itself was enough to convince me to come back again.  Truly delicious.

Great happy hour by the way.  Was there on a walking tour of Scottsdale after the Scottsdale Art Fair and the day was too beautiful to sit inside.  Wound up craving a patio and bounded for 5th and Wine.  The bruschettas are delicious (on the smallish side, but aside from Postino's some of the best I've had).  The wine list is great (plus its $5.00 at HH prices).  The chicken sandwich was huge but not great.  Stick with wine and bruschetta at sunset.  There is often live music, either there, or just around the corner that you can listen to and do some people watching.

No nonsense coffee place with a simple chalk board with the types of coffee and the ways they will prepare it.  Not a huge selection of baked goods.  You get the sense that the proprieters are a little joyless and a little wary of corporate folks who want to grab a madeline with their $6.00 latte.  I like that angry streak.  their coffeee actually features in a drink that Nobuo's Teeter House offers on their menu which is coffee mixed with bourbon.  How genius is that.  They don't need to be nice, they just need to believe in their product.  And the product, is top notch.

One of the best kept cheap beer places.  During happy hour, decent suds are 2.50 a pint.  Delicious and economical!  The patio is a great hang out spot.  The interior is hard if you are group. Mostly two tops.  Food is pretty solid, nothing crazy on the menu but definitely substantial enough to serve as dinner should you decide to stick to adult beverages.  Definitely one of my favorite places.

Eh...its okay.  Had the salmon, thought it was good.  The appetizers are good, the PBR in a paper bag a little tongue in cheek.  I think the problem is, that this place is too trendy and the food is just too average for me to want to push through the crowd to try and secure a dinner spot.  Its super loud inside and the bar is extremely crowded.  Everyone is pretty.  Not complaining, just saying that I wish the food was just as pretty.  The menu is a mish mash of comfort food and whatever trendy restuarant ingredient is hot that week.  Still, its nice to have another option when you're scratching your head and wonderfing where to go when you are next to the mall.

Love the location.  This is a bar / lounge that is a stone's throw from Kasimeriz really that isn't too stuffy or pretentious.  They have good drinks and the music is generally pretty good.  (I sometimes find it a little loud for my taste).  They know how to make a classic cocktail, (a friend ordered a sazerac and it came out just fine, along with the trendier rum based cocktails that seem to be all the rage right now.  I really like the interior, the ceiling, the chandeliers and furniture are all really comfortable and loungy.  This is a great spot for 4-6 people, too many more might be tough as it is a very popular spot.  Fridays and Saturdays will be packed.  Try a Tues thru Wednesday approach.  The waitresses are all very friendly and won't make you feel dorky if you are not a hipster or Scottsdale staple.

Absolutely adore pita jungle.  I'm not a vegetarian but I love their food.  I get the fattoush salad which is warm rice and beans and tons of garlic on romaine.  I've had their schwarmas, their falafal and their hummos and have never had a bad experience.  The new location makes me super happy.  Parking can be hard sometimes but there is a garage just next door.

this is a a bit of a twilight zone for me.  It's light and bright and airy.  the workersI all have uniforms and bright cheery smiles on their faces.  They don't even look disgruntled like most teenagers.  The day I went, there was a reservation for a group of bright eyed precocious children reviewing their performances of a school production of "Grease".  Everyone was happy.  The quotes on the wall are very midwestern, bible belt type.  But the malts, oh the malts.  I have't had a vanilla malted in years.  They make it with their vanilla custart and i asked for extra malt, so much it was nearly crunchy.  The malt was perfect, thick, (spoon necessary) and good to the last spoonful, not too sweet, not too runny.  All for the princely sum of $3.00.  I could almost see myself donning a blue uniform and a smile while humming the tune Greased Lightning....

This review is limited to the comedy show portion only.  (i.e. not commenting on food etc).  Just got back from the Robbie Fox comedy show.  It was a Phoenix comediens versus Las Vegas comediens show.  They had a great emcee and a panel of three judges.  There is an 8:00 show and then a 10:00 show.  We had tickets to the 10:00 show.  (Tickets are 10.00 and do require a two drink minimum).  The room is small and tables are scarce.  Get there early!  Even though the show was supposed to start at 10:00, it really didn't get going until 11:00  A minor annoyance, especially once the show got started.  We got to enjoy six (6) different comedians.  All funnier than the last.  Best $10.00 spent, to date.   I like Stand Up Live, bigger names and bigger acts.  But with that, bigger prices.  i.e. tickets are $25.00 a piece before taxes and service fees. Drinks are also a 2 drink minimum, the difference being the price.  The venue is bigger.  But if you are interested in supporting local acts, come to Robbie Fox.  Great local talent, smaller prices and a more intimate feel.  By the way, I laughed until I almost cried.  (This is a good thing!)

It's Arcadia.  That's about all I like about it.  I don't like the decor for many reasons.  It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better.  The burgers are dry and don't taste of much.  For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor.  The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.

My experience was only for takeout and not dining in so perhaps dine-in folks will have better luck.  Massamam curry and pad thai is a pretty safe bet when ordering at a Thai restaurant you haven't been to before.  Sadly, the spice levels were off (one was waaay spicy, and the other had no flavor at all).  The curries seemed really watery and the pad thai noodles were mushy.  I was sad :(

If you get a hankering for a quick, delicious (and unhealthy) burger fix, you have to go to Smashburger.  Since the burger craze started, there have been an influx of burger joints all claiming to be the best burger in town.  I think this one has the best mix of grease, salt and bun.  When it comes to price, it has a great price point (under $6.00) for a burger, the fries are good although the onion rings admittedly are a little dry but overall, the patty is delicious.  If I'm not going more upscale with Delux, this is the place to go after a day of shopping at the Collonade.

I really adore this place.  The staff is knowledgable and friendly even to wine novices like me.  The prices are good and there are always bottles chilled and ready to purchase and consume.  If you feel like eating, there are plates of cheese and hummus or light salads and sandwiches.  Great places for a relaxing glass of wine with friends, but it can get busy and there aren't all that many tables.

They are open again!  The green chili soup is delicious and is like playing Russian Roulette.  Sometimes it's super spicy, sometimes its manageable.  Pork Adovada is the standard here.  What I like is that you can also order off of the Rokerij menu and the wine menu is exactly the same which is nice.  They have a great patio which you should take advantage of if you can.  I'm still annoyed that they can't just give you a chile relleno a la carte, you have to get the entire plate.  These are the quirks that you deal with when you come here.   The service is friendly and yes the prices are still a dollar or two, too high, but then again, it looks exactly like the old restaurant, so the same gripes and same good stuff are all there.

With the steady supply of accolades and awards, I really really really wanted to like this place.  The crust was too charred for my taste and almost cracker thin which was overwhelmed by the high quality toppings.  I can't complain about the quality, it was the execution or perhaps I just don't have sophisticated enough tastes.  I felt that the toppings would have been better served on a slightlier chewy dough with a more substantial crust.  The restaurant itself is cute, well lit and bright but nothing to write home about.  Service is fast, (I think the wood burning oven cooks a pizza in three minutes flat), but I'm not sure I'll be making the drive again when there is Cibo, Gaspers, Bianco's and even Grimaldi's around the corner.

Like most of the trends that hit Phoenix, we were a little late to the game, and then our market becomes over saturated to the point I get a little nausesous.  The bright spot is the Yogurtology at least gets the balance between smoothness and tartness right.  I can't do frozen yogur where it is too icy, or too sweet.  I like it really tart and where it actually tastes like yogurt.  If I want it to taste like soft serve, I'd go to DQ or Culvers.  This place is super cute, very well lit and less "sticky" ie it is cleaner than most fro-yo places.  Overall I like it, I can't say that I'm a fan of all flavors and I usually don't even do toppings.  That helps since like many indulgencies, per ounce, it can get a little silly to spend so much per ounce :)

The vegetable fries are okay.  Could have used more time in the fryer.  Of all of the fox concepts, this one seemed to have been an afterthought.  The mural inside is cheeky, reminding one that you are indeed eating a cow.  But the milkshakes are really good as are the desserts, its just that when you are going for a burger, you really really want a good burger.  The burgers are just okay.  The only good one is the kobe burger, the rest taste about the same as you can get at Cheesecake factory.  The uniformed servers look and act like they were culled from a fresh training group.  They are trying though!  If you have a burger hankering, you're better off heading to Delux or Smashburger.

Big portions, that's really all I can say about this place.  The sauce is okay, the brisket is okay but nothing is great.  Rootboot floats are good, but nothing I can't make at home.  Worth one shot if your curious but I'm not going back.

Love this place when it's not summer.  It's a converted building (used to be a boxing gym back when buildings were built of chewing tobacco, brick and fear) so it is hot.  There is no cool air circulating in the place.  Food is tasty (sliders, fried mac and cheese) etc.  But really just come for the cocktails.  It's nice to have another place that takes pride in it's mixers.  They make their own lemonade, they steep some of their own liquors.  More importantly, they make one of the best grey hounds I've ever had in this town.   Granted it's a little far south and can get warm, but the good news is, you can come on over, pretend that you aren't an aging hipster and order a few cocktails that will remind you of why it is you still work that 9-5 job.

Next to Lee Lee market which makes it a convenient place to run into before going grocery shopping.  You can watch the chefs make the incredible noodles.  This is the first place in Phoenix with actual hand pulled noodles which is an art.  I can't imagine the patience and skill it takes to transfor simple ingredients like flour, water and salt into these beutiful noodes.  From flat and broad, to thin and delicate, they have all styles. The different styles of noodles will complement different types of sauces and toppings.  The waiters are pretty good at recommending the right kind of noodle for the type of toppings.  Tea costs extra (which is a little annoying), but other than that I can't really complain.  You know it's good when about 90% of the restaurant is made up of hungry Asian folks :)

Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless.

Love this place.  $4.00 for love.  You can't beat that.  They will freshly brulee the top of the creme brulee of your choice.  The flavors will change but love and attention that goes into each little cup will not.  My favorite is still simple vanilla or lavender, but I just had a sea salt caramal that made up for a crazy day of nutty clients.  Usually it would cost me many many more dollars in over priced cocktails to have that affect.  Bonus, is that no one looks at you judgmentally if you eat creme brulee before noon. Add them to your facebook or twitter.  It really is worth stalking.

Was surprised this was not horrible.  It's right next to the Blockbuster and Jamba Juice I'm at fairly regularly and in a mad dash for dinner one night got take out there.  Is it authentic?  Not really, its got a mashup of Chinese-American items where most of the proteins are covered in batter and fried.  It has some Thai dishes.  The owner is Chinese from Hong Kong.  I'm hoping that if I go back a few times and order in Chinese, the dishes might come out a little less MSG filled.  An order of ten crab rangoons, and two dinner combos came out to $20 bucks.  Not bad for a last minute desparation dinner.  I'd really like more vegetables with my entrees, but the to go container was packed full of food.  The fried rice is standard soy-sauce colored rice with bits of egg.  The sauces were not too sweet (although shockingly red with food coloring).  Let me know if anyone has any luck finding an okay Chinese restaurant in S. Scottsdale.  I'm getting sick of Totties and am not a fan of the Tottie's service/price.

Went here with my folks on a Saturday night.  Not super busy but it was delicious and I'm glad I came.  Had roasted mushroom salad, the Regina pizza and veal marsala.  The salad was sweet which was a surprise and I likely won't order it again as it was a pretty standard mix of mushrooms.  I was thinking there'd be somethign exotic especially if the mushrooms are the highlight. The Regina pizza was delicious.  Prosciutto, Arugula, shaved parmagiano.  The real plus was that we had leftovers the next day and the pizza didn't completely fall apart like the ones I've had a Cibo.  No leftovers on the veal, and the sauce was so tasty that we kept going back for more with the little nibbles of bread crust that they serve to snack on (like pita chips but made of bread dough). All in all, delicious and will be back!

I love food trucks.  Short Leash does it really well.  The signage is a little confusing but basically for about $5 bucks you can get a great meal.  Customize a dog with pita bread and fill up.  I like to go on Fridays and follow up my meal with some ice cream from Sweet Republic.  Lunch for under ten buck, both me and my stomach are happy!

I have not had the omakase dinner but I am saving my pennies (and it'll take quite a few) for the experience.  The dinner is amazing.  I've been twice for dinner and once for lunch and each time I have left full and happy. At lunch:  the okonomiyaki can not be missed.  So few places make this and it is pure comfort food.  The pork belly buns are also great. For dinner:  The sugar snap pea while good is nothing you can't make at home.  But I literally have dreams about the hamachi with grapefruit and the Shiromi Ceviche.  For those of you who like Uni the Kumamoto Oysters with Uni can not be missed.   For drinks, I'm partial to the Oze IPA and this new concoction which mixes bourbon with coffee from Cartel.  Will be coming back again and again!

Great ambiance. Flamenco dancers and great singers. The menu is expansive, the food can be great or only so so. The gambas while good were nothing new, I will say that the stuffed mushroom were amazing. The garlic aioli served at the table with the bread was a nice touch. Service is very uneven. The servers appeared frazzled and not all that knowledgeable about the menu. I will say however, the best thing about dinner was their flan. I rarely like flan, but theirs was creamy, dense and just sweet enough. The weakest point was actually the sangria. Weak, watery and expensive.   This place does make me long for Lolas....

Went back recently and had food that was much much better than my first experience.  Maybe I ordered better, maybe it was the company, but this time I left happy and satisfied.  The bread comes piping hot and fresh and you can dip it in a super garlicky sauce that is addictive.  (well addictive if you like aioli's compared to butter).  Had the Spanish sausage, chicken paella, the tortilla, and papas bravas.  Washed it down with the white bubbly sangria that was delicious.  Everything came out the right temperature and looking delicious.  I was not dissapointed this time at any of the food.  We got out of there for a very reasonable price and my only gripe was that when we ordered dessert they substituted an apple tarte for the baked apple we wanted without telling us it was no longer available.  Aside from that small misstep it was great.  The guitar player really made the atmosphere interesting and fun.  Overall, I am changing my tune about Tapas Papa Frita.  Oh and they have a great Happy Hour I plan on trying on the weekends.

Mac and Cheese is delicious.  The burger is decent but the drinks are why I think it's worth going.  They have an inventive drink list that is worth pursuing.  The music is a little loud and the guests can be a bit trendy (making me feel like a dork) but sometimes when you are in the mood for a nice drink after work or for a cozy brunch I think this is just the place.  Super pretty interior and pretty people.

Not my favorite of the Scottsdale nonesense crowd.  mixed crowd, skews young.  large patio facing the street, the inside has three bars and a few tables you can try to either reserve for bottle service (which is bizaree given the calibar of this place) or you can try to muscle your way past the crowded so called dance floor to a back bar.  Very crowded by the end of the evening.  definately filled with young rhythm challenged girls in super tight dresses.  makes me long for the simple days of devil's martini.

I waited a good long time to try this one out.  Everyone seemed to be singing its praises and I was convinced that there was no way it could be that good.  Apparently the masses were right.  The food is delicious (reasonably priced, no entree creeps up past the $25.00 mark and most in fact are around $15.00 dollars).  On Sundays they do a half-price wine deal which can't be beat and they are brave enough to re-acquaint folks with the much maligned pink wines. One complaint is that they don't have much by way of vegetarian items.  You could get the vegetarian spaetzel or try the sausage and grits without the sausage.  (They were delicious by the way, Schreiner's sausage and sun dried tomatoes yum!).  The burgers are served on Brioche and topped with Boursin cheese.   The green chile stew could give the one at St. Francis a run for its money.  I would have liked it more spicy, but the cornbread was heavenly.  Oh and don't skip dessert.  Desserts are $6.00 dollars (a steal for what you get).  We had the chocolate covered bacon, served with Becket's s'mores which are graham crackers, homemade peanut butter mousse and homemade marshmallows.  The pecan and fig pie is amazing (the pie crust itself is a thing of beauty) but what tops it off for me is the Crave ice cream in a special Beckett's only cream cheese ice cream.  It tastes like marscapone and lemon zest in which I can only hope Heaven will serve.  Or Hell. I don't care where I go so long as it has that dessert!

Updating my last review of Beckett's.  Came back on Sunday night, they have half price bottles on Az wines and several of my favorites become more than reasonable at that price.  Was three for three on the menu choices.  Started with duck confit salad (duck confit, butter beans, frisee and a balsamic glaze) that was beautifuly balanced and was the perfect way to ease into mussels.  The mussels (while still not toppling Zinc as my favorite mussles stop) were delicious in a lobster broth with shaved fennel and roasted garlic.  The bread its served with (you can and should order extra) is grilled and buttered.   The table butter is a sweet honeyed butter perfect for the hot fresh rolls.   *Don't worry, the buttered grilled bread with the mussels is not the whipped honey butter but a lightly salted creamery butter, these little attentions to detail are hugely important! Finished with a pork osso bucco that was served with a roasted apple spaetzle.  The pork was so tender, the knife was not used at all.   For once I could not even contemplate dessert, even their heavenly award winning fig and pecan pie.   This is one of my new favorites joining the ranks of Noca, Christopher's and T.Cook's The good news is that dinner for two along with a full bottle of wine came out to about $85.00 (including tax and tip).  A pretty smoking deal considering the quality of food and amazing service. Our server was attentive, kind and not obtrusive at all which is a huge huge plus.

I'll admit I was a bit skeptical since I hadn't been to this place since it was still a buffet.  My understanding is that it is under new management and they have gone back to their roots.  i.e. quality, delicious, (and authentic) Cantonese specialities.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner.  I will admit that you have a slight advantage here if you speak Chinese and can read a Chinese menu (some of the tastiest lunch morsels are on the Chinese menu) but you really can't go wrong.  They have all the usual standards, soy sauce chicken, fresh fish, veggies.  But they have a few unique tofu dishes you can't get a lot of other places.  One thing that I would add is I wish they had a fresh fish tank.   Service is friendly and fast.  I think I'll be adding this to my regular rotation.

The parking is horrific.  (It's in the same structure as Luci's and a cupcake store).  However, brave the parking situation since this is a much needed local non-chain addition to the neighborhood.  Without dissing Zipps across the street, (I mean, how many Zipps can one metropolitan area really need?), this is a great place to watch football and get a few beers.   The cons are that there are on a few good beers on tap, which does thankfully include a cider.  The food is good.  I really really like the garage board, which is one of the best cheeseplates in town.  Artfully assembled, with the perfect mix of cheeses, meats and different nuts, olives and sweets its addictive.  The decor is minimalistic and could actually benefit with another mural but overall its a comfortable easy place to grab a beer and eat a deviled egg.  Seriously, they have bacon.  They are delicious.

Love this place.  Gourmet burgers and shakes.  The shakes are made to order (i.e. I got my vanilla malt heavy on the malt, to the point it was almost crunchy and I was super happy).  Glad I got the onion rings rather than the fries and the you can't go wrong with the burgers.  I did get a salad to make myself feel a little virtuous, (a milkshake and a cocktail at 10:00 a.m.) do tend to make you feel a liiiitle guilty.  The server was super nice and took the time to point out his favorite art, share stories about the artist and some of the pieces.  Fabulous place and I can't wait to come back.  Super chill and they give you delicious popcorn, which you can ask for a to go container of and will make for an excellent midnight snack.

For a secret, it is totally not a secret.  One of the reasons I really like the Cosmopolitan hotel.  They were wise enough to remember that after a late night excursion, sometimes you want a hot dog cart or a pizza joint.  A long hallway (covered in great record albums) will lead you to an old school pizza joint complete with Galaga in the corner.  You can order by the slice or entire pies.  Both Sicilian style or thin crust.  Warning, the pizza is super greasy.  But delicious!  And for about 4 bucks a slice, it's the cheapest meal you'll get on the strip.  They will gouge you on Diet Coke though.  I think a medium diet coke is like 5.50 Worth seeking out and the perfect way to wrap up a busy night of dancing or gambling. The night I was there a fight nearly broke out (they have a ton of security) so technically you are getting dinner and a show!

This place is awesome  It'd be even more awesome if you are here on a business account.  it is pricey, and the drinks seem to be thimble sized.  But the sushi!  The sushi is impeccably fresh.  The sensai roll (triple color, yellowtail, tuna and salmon) is literally one of the best rolls I've had.  The rice was well seasoned (could use a smidge more vinegar) but a great foil and not too much rice.  Egg custard is not to be missed.  Served in a little ceramic cup with a lid, it stays piping hot.  Smooth, rich and filled with seafood, it is amazing.  Another don't miss is the claims. The clams are dotted with truffled butter and miso before a quick broil. So overall, loved this place.  it's pricier than even Roka Akor.  (They have sushi boats that start at $250.00) But the fish is amazing, the service is kind an worth stopping in at least once.  Weirdly for a really nice restaurant, they give you paper napkins rather than cloth.  Minor quibble, but I still found it weird given the attention to detail every where else.  The bar and tables for instance are some of the prettiest and comfortable pieces of furniture around.  But no cloth napkins?

Okay I really wanted to not like this place.  I did not go for dinner.  With a crew of 8, I went to the Sunday Brunch.  $10.00 bottomless champagne. I repeat $10.00 bottomless refills.  Okay truth be told it's sparkling wine but who cares.  They refill pretty regularly.  You'll be tipsy enough that you won't care that they charge $12.00 a carafe for juice in the event you want to make your own Bellini or Mimosa.   The brunch menu is pretty varied and is surprisingly reasonable.  The scones are mini-scones and are delicious.  It does come with Devonshire cream and jam on the side as they should.  The eggs benedict are some of the best.  Truffled hollandaise was a nice touch.  Go for the regular eggs benedict and not necessarily the short ribs.  The regular ones really are the best flavored.  The bacon is good, if you want to be really decadent go for the pork belly.  It is fatty goodness. The stuffed french toast was more of a large warm jelly-doghnut, not in a bad way.  But if you like decadent French toast go for the french toast at Frank and Albert's. The vibe is very Vegas, or to compare to a place locally, think of Modern Steak at Fashion Square.  Perfect for bachelorette parties.  Purple walls, plush lounges, glass and mirrors everywhere.  The men folk we were with thoroughly enjoyed their experience.  There are many Scottsdale types perfect for people watching.

This will end up being the dowtown HH place.  (at least until the wine bar or vodka bar opens up).  Already getting busy at lunch and dinner I'm happy to say that it is dong a brisk HH service.  Love the fact that they are unpretensious and are happy to service an excellent cheese plate along with giant pretzels accompanied by velvetta cheese dipping sauce.  The drinks are yummy and at HH they are four dollars.  A steal anywhere but especially downtown.  You can get outdoor seating on the patio or inside which is architecturally interesting.  Mix of cafe meets industrial, meets dark woods.  I adore it.

Had a recent birthday party here.  They were kind enough to let me bring my own cake and take over a large portion of their restaurant on a Saturday.  (We had about 50-60 folks drop in over the course of 4:00 p.m. to about 8:00).  During HH, the drinks are $5.00 and many appetizers are very reasonably priced.  The food was devoured quickly and without complaint.  Brittni the manager was very gracious about letting us have so many people there. One thing I will say is that parking is tricky.  Their lot is not big and they have another gated area across the street that filled up rather quickly.  I should have told people to car pool!  They opened up the patio area which made the restaurant quite warm.  Other than that, the guests really enjoyed themselves.  It is family friendly, (they have high chairs and whatnot), with a good menu that has enough variety to keep lots of people happy.  Great sangria and they even have a "Pickle Back".  Check it out on the menu :)

Can you say ghetto?  In grad school, my friends and I went to the Cactus Moon on Tucson all the time.  It was a great mix of upbeat country music and the latest fun dance tune and a little hip hop. The Mesa crowd is thuggish and rough.  The back of the bar has games, foozeball tables, pool tables and lots of tvs.  Tvs are everywhere.The drinks are reasonably priced.  No one dances at all during the country songs (I think those that like country should just go to Tobey Keith's which is right next door).  When hip hop was finally played, the dance floor was pretty crowded.  The place is kept a bit on the warm side, and all was good until literally a fight broke out.  Not just any ol little fight, but a beer bottle throwing (there was so much glass one of my girlfriend's had her legs totallly cut up), chair/stair throwing melee.   I have never ever seen so many people want to jump in on a fight.  The police were called and the entire bar was evacuated.  Ridiculous.  There is nothing redeeming about this place.  Save yourself the experience and go to Scottsdale.  (Never thought I'd say that in a million years, but seriously skip this place!!!)

Excellent Irish Pub.  The servers have the appropriate accent and attitude.  (i.e. warm, friendly and understanding that you are there to be a little loud).  The food is excellent, and for Vegas, decent prices on the drinks and food.  Of the meals not consumed in liquid form, this place was an excellent suggestion from a friendly local at the Mandalay Bay who was selling huge 64oz adult slurpees.   Very happy I found this place, I wouldn't have tried it otherwise.

The lunch is actually a good deal, quick on the uptake (i.e. I can get in and out within 40 minutes) and the service is attentive.  It is never that busy (which is a bit of a shame) it is after all still a restaurant at a W.  That being said, the menu is designed for business travelers.  heavy on the salads and sandwiches.  The menu skews American and slightly southwestern.  I was impressed by the service, they made some modifications to the entrée when I had a friend who had severe food allergies brought it up.  I never think to come here but compared to the District at Sheraton, I think this place is the way to go.

I hope being named one of Travel & Leisure's best Chinese food restaurant in the country doesn't ruin the place.  i.e. I hope that folks don't flock there and then the kitchen gets lazy.  Right now, it's a great mom and pop, hole in the wall, blink and you miss it place with tasty non-typical Chinese fare. The food here is dongbei which translates to "East/North".  ie. this is the style of food you get in the Northernmost Easternmost regions of China.  No rice here.  You will find cumin on lamb, wheat buns stuffed with minced meat and a delicious cold noodle dish that is the most refreshing salad you'll find in all of China. (The Cantonese aren't exactly known for their salads after all)    The food is going to be assertive. The main dipping sauce is black vinegar after all.  Not a lot of veggies on the menu which could be difficult for your vegetarian friends, but for those who love pot stickers, they make great ones.  The food is dirt cheap, bring a mess of friends and grab a formica table.  Between this place, China Magic Noodle House and Hong Kong Gourmet, I can actually be tempted outside my 10 mile (Phoenix) radius from time to time.  Bonus:  They actually seem friendlier than most Chinese restauranteurs.  (Again, who knows what it'll be like after the publicity)

I feel like this is the P.F. Chang's of Mexican food.  I think that they are still working out a lot of kinks in service.  Our server was very sweet and pleasant but she was clearly overworked and the kitchen was slow.  The salsa tasted heavily of lime and no other flavor.  The chips were warm at least.  Ordered their house specialty of black chile pork.  I was expecting something redolent of spices and maybe even chocolate.  We got instead something tasty in a reddish oily sauce.  The pulled pork quesadilla was good, (and reminded me a lot of the black and blue quesadilla with its sweet flavor at Sam's cafe).  The burger was actually the best, with a juicy patty.  Ask for a side of chipotle rance, it'll make the skinny fries taste out of this world.  Not a bad choice at the biltmore, just not a destination place and not what I would go for if I was craving Mexican food.

Took me forever to finally leave the comforts of Phoenix to check out Curry Corner.  My only regret, not coming sooner!  Super close, right next to ASU.  Fast, friendly service.  Some of the best garlic and cheese stuffed naan around.  Had the chicken tikka, lamb, biryani and of course a mango lassi.  Like many family owned gems, the décor isn't fancy.  I was a little worried that they would rest on their DD&D laurels like some restaurants do, but I am eagerly looking for another excuse to head back and check out the rest of the menu.

Finally another downtown lunch option.  I'm viewing this as the "in-between" place, in-between Arrogant Butcher's heavy on the lawyer, heavy on the political scene diners, and in-between "Celtic-Hooters", I mean, Tilted Kilt upstairs.  The food menu is interesting, a lot of appetizers.  Not enough salads for my taste.  Compared to Arrogant Butcher and likely Tilted Kilt, the menu has less salads and less fried foods, but it'll be hard to find something healthy to eat.  It veers towards the comfort food side, with options like chili with cornbread souffle, and flatbreads served with burrata fondue.  There are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza.  The day I went, the lunch room was busy. (You enter in through the a lobby shared with Stand Up Live).  Didn't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection, will have to try that out the next time I'm here for a show.  The management and service is very friendly.  (Not in a scary way, just in a "I really want to enjoy your experience way).  This is in sharp contrast to the service at Lucky Strike across the way which I've found to be downright rude at times.  Keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well.

This place is not the place to go when you are on a limited budget and need to get together a sandwich tray in a hurry.  You are paying for convenience and pretty things.  It's AJs (and possibly even more expensive than AJs) but it is downtown right across the street so you are going to pay extra for the convenience.  Having said that, I like Oakville.  They carry a good selection of non-essentials and even some essential items.  There is lunch service with items like sandwiches to half a chicken (which is actually a steal at about five bucks).  They have an olive bar and coconut water by the mountainful.  The dessert counter is what I rave about.  The desert counter is populated with Tracey Dempsey chocolates, scones and desserts like panna cotta.  They even have macaroons from Essence bakery.  I will likely end up spending much too much time and too many calories in this place.  Oh and for lunch, they have indoor seating in air conditioning which is key.  It's a nice place to grab something and chit chat with a colleague without feeling rushed or crowded.

Great to find another tucked away Szechuan restaurant.  All the old classics are here and executed nicely.  Definitely come for family style ordering.  Not everything has to be made spicy and the kitchen will adjust.  The one thing I'm not always used to (mostly because Cantonese people tend to like light flavors) is the amount of oil used.  I just find myself telling the kitchen to go a little lighter on the oil and I've never had a problem.

Breakfast is of course the star.  I generally don't bother with their lunch menu.  Be warned though, there is nothing healthy on the breakfast menu (except maybe the oatmeal).  The eggs benedict is done well and it comes with a mountain of potatoes.  The pancakes look more like dessert than your first meal of the day.  One gripe?  No diet coke!

Used to come here with an exboyfriend when it was under a different owner. Back then, it was our "go-to" Indian takeout place.  Nothing made me happier than grabbing takeout on the way home and we could settle in for a relaxing night in of food coma and great television.  Sadly, much like that relationship, all good things eventually come to an end.  In this case, the new restaurant is okay but not great.  The to-go orders tend to get mixed up,  (Chicken Korma instead of Chicken Tikki given), but my biggest gripe is that the naan is not nearly as good as it once was.  Naan is now overly chewy and doughy.  Maybe its been the few times I've come in, but when the naan isn't great, it breaks my heart.  Oh and the spiciness factor seems to be off.  i.e. its either way spicy, or way bland.

Hipster central.  I think the statute of limitations has passed so I can confess that I once got drunk with some of these hipsters and *may* of taken home one of the ubiquitous owls littering the place.  I enjoy the backroom where they have adult Disneyland complete with shuffle board and ski ball.  Drinks are solid and if you are hungry, the pretzel is amazing.  I will say that I was not happy with parking attendant grouch who let me park my car and then tell me that I couldn't park there after I hoofed it across the parking lot in heels....

The bahn mi is pretty tasty.  Crusty bread, pork patties.  The spring roll is meh and the bun is down right disappointing.  The meat has less flavor and tastes really of char.  I'm used to going to scary places in interesting neighborhoods for good food, but this place is pretty scary, even for someone used to hanging out next to K-Mo Mo.  If the food was good, I'd totally brave it, but between looking out for my car and being sad that my bun was ice cold (I mean I know it is supposed to be room temperature but this was close to ice cold and barely cooked through).  The egg rolls are some of the most depressing things I've had in awhile, looked like sausage wrapped in crunchy paper.  So maybe if you are going to have just bahn mi (which is a steal at 2.95 a piece) I'd avoid the rest of the menu, which is actually the most limited menu I've seen in a Vietnamese restaurant.  Oh and the staff started making eyes at me to leave at 8:30 p.m., I don't mind surly, but don't kick me out!

My only gripe about this place is that you can't buy equipment here!  Went to get fitted for golf equipment.  Decided that after all these years I needed to finally learn and take lessons.  To do that I wanted to start off with the right equipment.  A colleague was kind enough to bring me to the personalized golf fitting.  You sign in and a professional analyzes your swing (I didn't really have one!) and decides how to customize your golf club.  It takes about 30 minutes and at the end of it you get a copy (also emailed to you), of recommended clubs and grips.  They were super nice and very friendly.  The facility itself is nothing to marvel at, it is utiliatarian and right off of the I-17, but the stuff inside is nothing short of magic.

I am reviewing the desserts.  Yes the desserts.  I've had the drinks (which veer on the sweet side).  I've had the food (which is like Houston's really but spiffed up) but the desserts are to die for.  Specifically the nutella bread pudding but the one to sit down for and weep over is the coconut cream pie.  I generally don't have these pies as the whipped cream does nothing for me.  But this time, even with non-coconut eaters we were doing battle over the crumbs.  The crumbs themselves.  Go and get yourself a coconut cream pie.  Their "happy endings" menu actually could turn ugly if someone doesn't get me a fork asap.

Crudo closed and then reopened at the strip mall next to Beckett's table and Acacia cafe.  The restaurant is adorable.  Bright, with chandeliers its like Modern Steak without the boob jobs.  The bar is tended by Micah Olson who is a sweetheart and the drinks, especially the "rebel son" are delicious.  They remind me of the drinks at Merc bar in its hey-day. The menu is small, but everything is meticulously prepared.  If you are lucky they are also doing a $30.00 prix fix which can't be beat.  The focus is on impeccably fresh ingredients prepared simply.  i.e. if I were doing the cooking at home, but didn't actually have to you know, cook.  The standouts for me are the risotto which while technically not a raw item, helped to really complete and round out the meal for me.  Definately give it a try.  That strip mall is really turning into a food destination which I know, is totally surprising.

The cocktail menu and HH food are divine.  Now that downtown finally feels like, oh you know a downtown, we needed a new place to hang out other than the butcher and hanny's.  Blue Hound has a great GM, a great mixologist and helpful staff.  They have the classics libations as well as reimagined ones, some even involving scotch.  The lunch specials are enough to put you into a food coma, I will say that dinner here can be challenging if your friends don't like to share food or are looking for more traditional fare.  (I do think they are a little heavy handed with the salt though).  Overall, I'm basically living here and should set up a little office in the corner next to the big community table.  In fact, I just gave myself an idea. Favorite things to eat:  Flatbreads, the caramel corn, the falafal bites, anything on the lunch menu. To drink:  The new Hemingway, the new Cuban, anything with bourbon or scotch in it. It is a weird mix of suits and hipsters.  The upstairs bar is less suity though.

We had a large group (14) or so.  I was really appreciative that the restaurant was willing to accomodate a large group and our server even split the checks that evening.  The first item (guacamole uniquo) which had guac and crab was so salty it had to be sent back.  The second order came out beautifuly and was delicious.  The rest of the entrees seemed hit or miss.  A girlfriend had to send back a glass of one twice since both glasses had turned.  The burger was tasty.  I am mixed on the tacos which seem pricey (three tacos without any accompanyments left many of us hungry).  The flatbreads were tasty but overly cheesed, and tended to be oily.  I'm still wanting to try out their brunch which looks tasty.   Service was not great.  To be fair, we were a large party and there was another realy large party on the patio, but we would put in orders and wait and wait and wait about 20 minutes before someone checked in on us only to find that our drink orders hadn't been put into the bar. I'm excited to have this addition to the neighborhood but probably won't go back for dinner for another few months.

Federal Pizza is giving my beloved Parlor pizza a run for its money.  The pizza's are great (I've had the LoneStar, the date and proscuitto as well as the brussel sprouts).  The borrata appetizer is great and they've finally caught on that we need more than two slices of MJ's bread.  The ambience as you can expect is fun and whimsy, this is from the LGO guys after all.....for a casual wine and bruschetta night I'd still go to Parlor.  (Parlor also has better dessert and cocktail selections) but for lunch, or a quick bite I think I'd lean towards Federal if not for the beer selection.

Writing to support a cute local business.  The restaurant is nothing to shake a stick at.  It still has circa 1983 glass block low wall dividers with tables that I'm sure have seen better days.  But you really are coming for the food.  And boy is there food a plenty.  The prices are dirt dirt cheap.  A veggie combo (4 different scoops of veggies/lentils/hummus etc) set on fluffy injera (with more injera on the side) is a whopping seven dollars.  Go for broke and order the large combination which comes with three meat dishes. It'll be $13.99  At this rate you can afford to have chai teat (hot or cold) and dessert.  Now I didn't try the dessert, I'm informed however it is baklava.  I will be back soon.  This is the type of place where you come to sit with a friend and talk.  The service is languid (i.e. not fast) but then again, they aren't going to hustle you out either.  It looks like they must have a hoppin' night life, with it's raised stage and what appears to be a screen broadcasting Ethiopian news.   (Oh and it still looks like the old Bacchanal, so it's like Greek restaurant meets Ethiopian teenager bedroom with crooked posters on the wall)  Overall though, it's a nice treat to be able to get away from the hot outdoors, break some spongy bread and not have to drive all the way to Tempe for some ethnic food that is a little less run of the mill than our usual taco joint.

Arrgh, just when I kicked my Chipotle habit, this place comes along.  Some great tortilla soup, custom made enchiladas that come out of the oven piping hot.  Why didn't some one come up with this earlier?  My biggest gripe is the parking lot, not the easiest to negotiate a little parking lot on 7th street during prime rush hour but worth it.  Oh they have great snickerdoodle and Mexican wedding cookies for purchase right at the counter!

Anyone who doesn't like Asian shaved ice has no soul.  Literally, they must have no sense of adventure, whimsy and lightness.  After a huge heavy meal (usually Thai or Indian) I crave something sweet but I'm so full!  What to do? Snoh to the rescue. It is sweeter than ice cream, but manages the impossible!  It is light, melt in your mouth in seconds snoh.  Forget granitas, ices or snoh cones.  The texture of this is what I imagine unicorn tears to be.  You can customize with flavor of snoh, you pick your topping(s) and a glaze (extra sugar delivery mechanism).  If I were better at math I could tell you how many combinations you can make.  They have a van for parties, so you can bring it to the office should you like.  They have punch cards (which I've run turn embarrassingly quickly).  It is bright and fun, they have interesting art on the wall that changes.  They have board games to play should you decide to not focus on the snoh itself.  Oh and it has huge stacks of dessert toast.  Just order it and be happy.

The place is scary, if you're worried about not having windows that is.  Inside, you'll find large family style tables and fluorescent lighting.  You will find surly waitresses who look at you like they really hate you as you order.  But you did not come for the service.  You came for the dirt cheap Tsing Tao Beer (thank goodness they have it to help quell the heat).  Half of the dishes on the menu won't be available.  If you're in luck they'll have super spicy wontons, chive pancakes, garlic marinated cucumber to start.  For main dishes you can't go wrong with their cumin lamb.  If you can bring someone who speaks Chinese.  It's a Northern Chinese restaurant, so the few Cantonese dishes (like walnut shrimp) are a disappointment.  But a table of us ate like royalty for very little coin.  Brave the scary parking and lack of ambiance.  Eat lamb, breath fire and drink beer.

Cafe Boa finally has a competitor in Tempe!  For date night I know that some college folks will never abandon House of Tricks, but for a new urban wine bar you have to check out Salut.  Went on their opening night and it was packed with families and pretty people.  The price points are very reasonable and they have both beers on draft and wine on draft.  (Perfect for when you might need to down a few...err one quickly)  Ambiance:  Similar to the Garage in Phoenix mixed in with the original Postinos.  Big patio area which is nice.  Try to sit on that side, admittedly there is one side that faces right into a parking lot, (but in Az, what restaurant doesn't) They have great music without becoming too loud.  Food is mediterranean inspired.  Think olives, pomegranate, feta etc.  The salads are delicious and do not miss the mushroom ravioli which I could have devoured all by myself but was forced the share.  I was full from two appetizers and a salad and the aforementioned wine so I didn't get to the main entrees which looked tasty.  Clearly I will have to come back.  The staff is pretty, but more importantly, very nice and considering how new the restaurant is, they ran a very smooth ship.  I am really hoping that this restaurant inspires more eateries to open up in Tempe.  (I might have a reason to leave my 10 mile Phoenix bubble more often)

Location is pretty, warning, it can get a little loud.  Came for happy hour before a show and service was quick and friendly.  It's from the makers of ZTejas so I was expecting things to taste corporate but was pleasantly surprised.  Have compared notes with others and most agree that the food is solid.  Don't come for authenticity, come for good chips and salsa, a decent margarita and inventive playful flavors.  It's not the cheapest place in town, you are looking at 3.95-4.95 for a smallish taco but the fillings include duck, short rib and quality veggies.   There are pretty stained glass windows to peer out of, the tvs over the bar can be distracting though.

I waited a good long time to come into snooze (worried about the hungry hoards that have been eagerly awaiting their opening), turns out I had nothing to worry about.  They are located in Town and Country right next to the LA fitness (so you can work off the pancakes I guess).  The coffee is good and served in comfortable large mugs.  Omlettes and savory dishes feature prominently and I haven't ventured into the sweet side of things (yet) as they veered a little into the candy side for me.  I love the décor, very comfortable mid centuryish modern.  Service was chipper, almost a little too chipper for a grouch like me in the morning.  For less chipper minded headed over to Daily Dose across the street, but if you don't mind happy come on over!

For some reason I'm in the neighborhood often and it took me this long to finally give it a try.   Some of the most well executed food I've had in a while.  Cocktails are refreshing and the food is well executed. It's a little bit of a cross between Lons at Hermosa with Crudo.   Adorable patio dining (not a huge place so not great for a work HH,) but romantic and a nice change of pace from the rest of the south Scottsdale scene.   Service is impeccable.  Attentive without being obtrusive.  A must try and a welcome entry into the food scene.

Have been here a few times now.  Each time I'm impressed by how fast the food comes out and how many people are enjoying themselves.  The place is small.  Not recommended for giant groups.  I'd stick to a group of four or at most six.  Four is perfect, enough to try a large variety of foods.  You can be as adventurous as you like.  They have fried stinky tofu covered in kimchee (pretty darn adventurous) to fried large intestine, (downright challenging).  For people who are more novices to the joys of Taiwanese style cuisine, try the shaved noodles.  Chewy, fat tender pieces of dough are stir fried with vegetables and your choice of protein.  I have a weakness for "three cup chicken".  I think it is equal parts of soy sauce, sugar and wine.  The chicken pieces come out a beautiful sticky brown, both crunchy and sweet.  It's positively addictive.  Depending on what you order, it can be a little spendy, the dishes are small and meant to be shared.  Think of it as Asian tapas or more filling dimsum.  Happy adventuring!

Came in on a Saturday night.  The new restaurant makes you forget that it was ever a Ruth's Chris.  The staff was kind and when we complained about the cold, they adjusted the temperature and checked in on us.  The place is spendy, and you will spend more than at CPH.  The cocktails are about 12-14 and listed more Absinthe and Pernod than I had seen in a while.  The Manhatten while served in a martini glass (so that it looks itty bitty) has enough alcohol in it to fell a buffalo. The appetizers include riblets and a wonderful avocado filled with goat cheese and roasted garlic.  Not something I see everywhere and delicious.  Had the octopus salad (which was good but not memorable, mostly octopus, grapefruit, mizuna and fennel bulb) and the classic chop which you can get at CPH and Cowboy Ciao.  But that salad is so good I find myself trying not to eat directly from the shared bowl.  The filet, scallops and ribs were all a hit.  The one miss was the meatloaf.  Was expecting it to be really homely and comforting, but found that one a bit dry.  Overall, will be coming back.  It's nice to have another fun restaurant option on the C.Corridor.  Going to get dessert next time too, but was too full!

Looks like another successful entry to the Vig family.  The location is great (right next to Cibo downtown).  As in the other vigs, there is a bocce court.  With cooler temperatures you are fine on the patio.  I suspect eventually they will enclose the patio entirely.  The place is small with respect to inside dining, and the bar looks exactly like the one on uptown. Food is Vig food.  i.e. if you're a fan you'll like it.  Nothing offensive.  Have the cheddar filled tator tots with jalapeno cream, which was good but there was no kick.  Had a southwestern salad and a prime rib sandwich.  The shoestring fries are tasty (flavored with smoked paprika).  I liked the fact that the sandwich was served on pretzel bread.  they could probably serve shoe leather on pretzel bread and I'd like it.  The Southwestern salad was good and inoffensive. Overall, will be back. Not destination dining, but I'm not sure that's what they cared about.  It's just nice to have another downtown patio hangout.  The cocktails by the way look revamped and might end up giving sidebar a run for its money. I did not have any server issues and was fortunate that things were pretty smooth.

I was heartbroken when Sam Fox closed Bloom in North Scottsdale.  Of all of his restaurants, the Henry is my favorite.  Now that he shuttered his steakhouse, the Henry stands alone as the most upscale of the offerings.  This makes sense as it is right next to the corporate headquarters of course.  The people who dine here are very pretty.  Stepford wife pretty.  Be forewarned.  The bar offers a wonderful list of cocktails heavy on the classics and a lot of wonderful bourbon offerings for which I have a definite weakness for.  The salads will be familiar (you can similar versions at Arrogant Butcher or Culinary Dropout), but the entrees are much more refined.  I had the branzino, which next to the branzino offering at Virtu, is one of the best I've ever found in Arizona.  Do not miss dessert, croissant bread pudding handily eclipsing the version that I used to crave weekly at Sierra Bonita.  So brave the Stepford Wives and head out.  (The acoustics could use some work, during lunch or crowded hh's you do have to shout a bit).  The service however is exquisite.  Attentive without being intrusive.  If nothing else, the Sam Fox guys need to teach a course on how to train servers for other restaurants to emulate.

This place will do well.  Warning, currently it is mobbed by downtown hipsters and lawyers.  I've heard complaints from people about the wait for a cocktail.  What they don't seem to realize is that this place specializes in craft cocktails, so the idea is that each cocktail will be a bit of a wait.  If you like, you can put your name on a list, and wander around a bit in the 115 degree heat and they will text you when the table is ready.  The food is hit or miss.  I like the cheese plate but the components are less harmonious than usual:  ham spread, chocolate covered corn nuts, a pear that I think is poached in wasabi, a hard cheese and a soft one with some charcuterie.  The short ribs remind me of sweet and sour pork in a good way.   Deep fried covered in a vinegary sugary sauce.  I didn't care for the panda tacos.  They didn't contain pandas.  What it did contain was peanuts, fried anchovies and chilis.  You then wrap them in a lettuce leaf with jalepenos and pineapple slices.  Cute but when I want a taco, I want a taco.  Or some vegetables, not necessarily peanuts.  This is a welcome addition to the down town scene, I have a feeling that I will be there quite often.  Although probably on expense account time, it's a little spendy with cocktails generally in the 14 dollar range.  Classic cocktails are about 10, with the option of upgrading them to a higher price point with better liquor.  The menu is expansive, something like 24 pages and probably hard to read if you are above the age of 30 and have bad eyesight.  The bar tenders will steer you in the right direction though if you are lost.

Yay Silver Dragon is back!  Our family used to go back when it was on 19th avenue and Dunlap.  There is no other place I got to for wonton noodle soup.  Never order off the American menu (if they have one).  Go and ask for a bowl of wontons.  You can get them with noodle or without.  They are heavenly.  Skip the fried potstickers (they taste a little like the ones you get at Costco).  This is homestyle Chinese food.  The décor and ambiance is zero.  The service is friendly enough but brisk.  You are eating in what looks like an old Wendy's after all.  The braised dishes and vegetables are outstanding.  The fried rice not so much.  Chicken will be served Asian style, cold and hacked to pieces so beware of bones.  Take out is super fast and is ready by the time I'm there.  (Better ambiance at home anyway).  But yes, get the wontons, you won't regret it!  PS you know it's good when every time I've been in, there are actual real, live, multi-generational Asian families pointed their chopsticks at each other.  This is how you know it's the real deal.  Bonus: it is really reasonably priced.

One of the best bundt cakes or cake in general around.  The cream cheese frosting really makes this cake.  The cake is moist but the frosting just knocks it out of the park.  I usually get the mini cake or if you can get the baby bundts which are bite sized and always a big hit at parties.  They come in beautiful party box and could not be tastier expressions of your affection.  Always serve the cake room temperature but I do pick up a couple at a time and put them in the fridge or freeze them if they last that long.  Of course they are on the sweet side, it is cake after all, but worth every bite.  They are a perfect treat to share with that special someone (you have to really really like them though to share these tasty guys) but when I don't feel like baking I'll make the drive to this friendly store and pick up as many as I can. The lemon poppy seed is beautifully balanced.  Red Velvet is a crowd pleasure, but my favorite is the carrot cake.  Ribbons of cream cheese frosting gild the lily on a cake that it not too heavily spiced and not too healthy tasting.  Hungry just thinking about it...
