I got here one night just a few minutes after it opened and I was pleasantly surprised at the ratio! I think it was like 6 girls for every guy! The girls seemed a little stuck up (maybe I needed a wingman?) The drink I ordered was a little weak but it wasn't that bad. I didn't stay long because I went to check out Axis-Radius (a club a block away owned by the same people) since it was my only night out in Scottsdale, and I was heading to Vegas the next day.

This tram is ONLY worth it if you're going from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay or visa-versa. If you're going to Luxor from either location, just walk (it's probably faster than waiting and riding the tram)

I wasn't expecting much with a buffet, but food that makes me puke can't be good.  I had orange chicken (soggy), spanish rice, fried rice, and some alfredo noodles. The noodles were delicous but I still ended up having to run to the restroom and puke, which is a definite warning sign.   I didn't eat here again after that and probably won't. If you insist on a buffet try the one at the Excalibur maybe?

I came here when my friend Mike B. brought me to see a mermaid show and get fried oreos. He had moved to Vegas from Seattle in June and I was down there on a little vacation!  Turned out they didn't have a mermaid show - it was the Mermaid CASINO that had them. They didn't have the fried oreos either! Oh well, we ordered some food and drinks.  My vodka cranberry tasted like pure cranberry juice. The Teriyaki was okay, but I've had better. The calamari was DELICIOUS!  Overall, I probably wouldn't come back but it was a nice one time thing.  Oh yeah, the waitresses wear mermaid outfits, which is a plus!

I'm NEVER coming here again!  When I first came I was waiting in line forever while the security/bouncer let several people ahead of me. I didn't see them check anything off a list so they couldn't be VIP or anything like that.  Then, I finally get in and the service just ISN'T there. I wait and wait and finally the bartender takes my order, and gives me a very weak drink! HELLO? I DIDN'T PAY $7 FOR A GLASS OF COCA COLA!! I ASKED FOR A JACK AND COKE!  Don't believe the hype, this place sucks!  Also El Hefe claims to have amazing tacos... I've had better tacos from a taco bus back home in Seattle, Washington.
