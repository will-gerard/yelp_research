Bamboo Nails is a great place (and SUPER clean)  to get a mani, pedi, fill, wax...Kim, the owner, does my nails every two weeks and they are always perfect. I usually have Jenny do my pedicure and she is awesome as well. I used another well reputed nail salon in the Ahwatukee area and they continued to cut my feet and mess up my nails several visits in a row. I switched to Bamboo and never looked back! I highly recommend them!!! You are sure to have a great experience.

Excellent...great food and service. Coffee stout called Morning Sex was to die for. Had the stacked enchiladas minus the egg...savory. Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed!

The food can be good when they are not out of what is on their menu. 50 percent of the time they are out of what we want to order. We live local so very annoying! Service is good about 75 percent of time. Don't recommend unless very occasional visit.
