Excellent food, great prices, great service. I come here several times a week. Live next door and it is always good. 6 buck burgers can't be beat!

Coronado Cafe is great! Excellent Happy Hour deals, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. This is one of those places where the staff enjoy being there and it shows in the service they provide, the food is wonderful, and you can actually sit and relax for a meal. It is very small and intimate place. If you bring a group you should know they do not split checks.

I was there last night, two words - CHOCOLATE CAKE! Try it. The cream cheese frosting was an awesome touch with the wonderfully moist cake.

Excellent store, great staff, and HUGE wealth of knowledge. Everyone who works here is super friendly, they order anythign you want, and carry a great selection of live and dry goods. My entire tank is stocked from this store. SASHA is a great person and has helped me to grow a beautiful tank over the last two years.

I had a great experience at Schwartz Laser recently. After years of contacts and being anxious of this procedure, after a quick 3 minutes I now have 20/15 vision. Dr. Schwartz is great at answering all of my questions before the surgery and on the day of surgery. I have had five scheduled follow up appointments with Dr. Bloomenstien who is also very nice. The office staff are very friendly and appointments are easy to schedule. Of note, on surgery day my partner had to wait in the car because the small waiting room was standing room only.

So am I weird if I like going to the dentist????? Not in a YIPPEE IT'S DENTIST TIME way, but it is actually a comfortable and relaxed place to be. Certainly much better than any other dental experience.   Dr. Duresik and his staff are great. I have been a patient for a few years now. Weather it is a simple exam or something more involved Dr. Duresik takes the time to make sure I am comfortable, that I understand the procedure, and follows up after my appointment to see how I am doing!   His staff are all equally friendly, professional, upbeat, and efficient. Providing a calm atmosphere where you can relax and let them do there job has been achieved. I'm on a first name basis with all of the staff and am greeted by each of them with a smile.   Elisa and Theresa are great hygienist who have mastered their profession and provide a pain free experience. Jessica and Natalie have the front and back office covered with an efficiency that will have you in and out in a jiffy.   The technology in the practice is up to date to ensure quality care as pain free as possible. It also expedites the checking in and checking out because it is all electronic. The text message appointment reminders and the friendly phone calls are a welcomed reminder of my appointment. The comfort factor of the office is a hit, the massage chairs are great, there are magazines and newspapers I actually want to read, and the daily SiriusXM station is always different. I'm waiting on WIFI access and then I'll be happy to hang out and spend more time chatting with everyone!

Great food and a wonderful view of the surrounding runway. The Mandarin Orange and Cranberry pork is excellent. The wine list is pretty solid, the staff is happy to provide samples of several wines and is very knowledgeable about pairings with dishes. The bar serves up great martinis! Have tried several deserts which are an excellent way to end your meal at Anzio Landing.

Dr. Alber and Dr. Freeman are great vets! They spend a lot of time with us when we bring our two dogs in for care and provide excellent care for our animals. The technicians and the office staff are great as well. They know our pets are nervous in the office and are very gentle with them. They know our pets by name and are happy to see us each time we come in. The quality of care our pets receive is reflected in the improvements we have seen in their health and longevity!

We enjoyed our car buying experience at Powell Volvo. We started out looking at a XC 90 with Licia. She was a very informative about the vehicle, laid back, and fun to be with. She encouraged us to push the vehicle and test out the safety features. Licia devoted as much time as we needed and was super to work with.   After a near mid life crisis, my BF decided that he "needs" a hard top convertible instead of an SUV. We went back and looked at the C70 and decided that was the car for us.   We also took advantage of the Overseas delivery, aka, free trip to Sweden and considerable savings on the car. There is a whole other pricing for vehicles you pick up in Sweden and it really is a free trip. No negotiation needed, prices are there in print.   Josh handles all of the Overseas delivery. Licia smoothly transitioned us to Josh, who efficiently handled our sale and coordinated our trip.   The service department is great. They try to give you an identical loaner when you leave your car and they take pride in their work.   When we do return to the dealership, we are always greeted by name and Licia is always there with a smile!

This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. They have some interesting dishes and an impressive margarita list! If you like spicy salsa ask for the "hot" salsa, it's very good. The service and food are consistently good. This is a favorite amongst our out of town guest as well. Tia's serves up great food and great atmosphere!

Swinging place and great food. I was there recently with a group of 12. The staff very efficiently handled our group. The eclectic music was spot on for the vibe of Vig and you could still carry on a conversation. I had the Five Spice edamame, Vigazz burger and a beer, the burger was fantastic. Other entrees with positive feedback from the group: Carne Asada, Love Me Tenderloin, Salmon, Hot Chick. The Five Spice Edamame was a nice spin on a usually unexciting appetizer. I'll be back soon to enjoy the outdoor patio!

I switched my lawn service six months ago to Palms Away from the corporate lawn company I was using previously. It is great to have a local, family owned company who actually cares about my yard and keeps my yard looking top notch. They take care of all regular maintenance, fertilizing, and tree trimming.   Marcy and her team pay attention to detail and go above and beyond. It is normal business for them to pull weeds by hand, do a final walk through each week, and tidy up my patio when they are done.   It is great to come home on a Friday to a perfect lawn and see that the pool toys are picked up, the grill cover was put on the grill, and that the patio furniture is neatly arranged.   Finally, a lawn company that cares!

Community Tire takes great car of my vehicles. They are very nice, prompt, honest, keep a clean shop, and do great work. They take the time to explain things, support the community, and actually get to know you as a person!   I happily drive out of my way to go here and spend my money!

Nice "local" bar. All the bartenders are friendly and pour a great drink. This place doesnt have the drama that most gay bars have.

I was at Z Tejas with a small group, 5 people total. I was excited to go to Z Tejas because it has been about two years since I was at the original in Austin. I was a frequent flyer at Z's in Austin, it was walking distance to my brother's house and it was fantastic.   This location is certainly not on my list of places to revisit.  1 - Very slow service, my water glass was empty more than it was full the whole time. Plenty of empty tables around us.  2 - 25 minutes to find out they had no Moet, no alternatives offered other than " we have good frozen margaritas".  3 - Portions are small, come on... this is a Texas restaurant. My Mom finished her whole meal and that doesn't normally happen.  4 - Food wasn't really good. Baked seafood enchiladas were more like canned tuna quality. The Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchiladas were meat and sauce layered on a tortilla. The Spicy Baja Shrimp Skillet had four shrimp total, yes four. The one decent dish of the night was Green Chili Barbacoa Enchiladas, it was like a chef actually prepared this dish!

The 3 4 1 happy hour really means they will take one drink and mix it with water and pour it into three glasses for you. It may be a "new" bar but it is worn out, it would be nice if they invested some money in the replacing the duct taped vinyl seating.

I have been purchasing my dog food from Pet Club since I moved to the Valley back in 2006. They carry a great variety of dog food and other items. The prices are great!   I did have one issues that was taken care of promptly. A bag of food had a hole in it, resulting in bugs in the food. A full refund was given and a free bag of food to boot. So, double check your bags before you purchase them, I have noticed a few bags recently that have been taped up.   The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Customer service is great. I enjoy spending my money at Pet Club.

this is a great service. They are prompt; the vans are clean and well kept. Their price will beat any other company. They know their way around traffic delays and drop you off at the terminal right where you need to be. The most they ever have is two stops per vehicle, so you aren't sitting in the van while other customers are dropped off or picked up. In the multiples times we have used them we have had the van to ourselves each time. And they don't charge extra for the jokes! I enjoy spending my money with this company.

I used Jeff to find an awesome condo at Summit at Copper Square. Jeff was efficient and made the process pretty easy. I did notice that like most realtors, punctuality was not 100%. Jeff always kept me updated on an ETA and responds  to all communications immediately. I would recommend his services, I'm a happy high rise guy now!
