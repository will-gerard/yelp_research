I had my lashes done at a different salon and had a terrible allergic reaction.  I called to have them removed and the salon said they were booked and wouldn't make time to remove them! I was in so much pain so I called Let's Lash and even though they were booked, they were able to squeeze me in and make me an appointment to get my lashes removed!! I am so grateful - what an amazing company.

Would not recommend!!! Went here to get lash extensions and had a terrible allergic reaction! Swollen, red, painful, itchy eyes. I called to have them removed immediately! The salon was "booked" and couldn't get me in to have them removed!!! I asked if they could stay past 7 and remove them and they said no! The Gilbert location offered to squeeze me in but it is an hour and a half of drive time to get there and back so I am scrambling to find another salon closer to remove these.
