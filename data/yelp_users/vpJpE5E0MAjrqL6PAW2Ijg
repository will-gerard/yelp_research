i was looking for a place that sold real Mexican tacos. so i ask a friend and told me this was the best place in town. and i agree. the burritos where not that big but still good. now the tacos where amazing. best in flour tortia.

So I came to this place when I seen it was on tv for having the best sandwiches in the usa... so I got the Sasquatch burger and it looks amazing really big... well after eating it, I realized it was nothing special. All it has is that its a big burger that's all. So I suggest u get something else cuz it was 16  bucks. Not worth it if u ask me since it was not that great. But if u want it too get some likes on ur Facebook or instagram then get....   Then my wife got the cowboy. It had chilli on it. And well it was a really dry burger. I don't get y but I didn't was not that good either...  So lessons learned. Not everything on tv is true.
