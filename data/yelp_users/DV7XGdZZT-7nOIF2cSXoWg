Service was great! Wings were large, the sauce I got was a little on the sweet side but I'll get a different one next time. My son and husband fell in love with the boneless wings though! I also got a request to come back for breakfast! Hahaha

I was pleasantly surprised to have received a bowl of pho that hadn't been Americanized! Was it as great at Pho 43 in Phx? No, but, the best in Scottsdale so far!!

I've definitely tried my fair share of doctors, and this office is by far one of the best I've been to. Minimal wait times, caring and informative doctors, and the front desk ladies are nice too!

My family arrived to celebrate my moms birthday! The hosting staff did a great job of seating us in a minimal amount of time. We had an emergency change in plans and they accommodated us quickly. They also accommodated the temperature of the room for our easily cooled friends. Everyone enjoyed their food. And the server was great UNTIL......two spiders crawled up onto our table right between me and my son. When I complained, I got some half assed excuse that they had just sprayed the night before from the manager. My husband, not wanting to look douchey and not like we were just trying to get a free meal, told them not to worry about it. But personally, I think they still should have done something about it. When you pay for a $500 meal, you don't want to deal with bugs. I was in the service industry for nearly 10 years, I understand the prejudice that goes on behind closed doors. I understand that they probably thought I was lying, but frankly, I couldn't care less. That's gross. I don't want to pay for a meal with bugs.

I used to frequent this place A LOT in middle school (or was it high school) well, I'm pushing 30 now and boy has this place gone down since then. I've stopped by a few times in the past years, but I'd have to say, this last visit will be my last visit. I stood in line for almost 45 minutes, granted it was busy, but holy moly! When I ordered my drinks, I made sure the girls understood it was a ToGo order so I didn't want a mound of ice on top to spill everywhere. She said she understood, but lo and behold, when I got my order, two big heaps of ice on our cups. Cool, easy fix, I scraped them off into a trash can, and off we went. Now, I understand, I used to come here all the time when it first opened, when they actually started out in AZ mills, but I remember when the cream was throughout the entire dessert. Nope, not anymore! Since I had to scrape off the tops, we were left with no cream! Boo! That's half the reason why this place rocks! But whatever, it's cool, kept eating, when I got a quarter down my drink I was disappointed to find dry, no liquid drenched goodness! Wtf?! By this point I'm pretty upset, not gonna lie. I dumped mine out to prove to my husband it just didn't seep to the bottom. I was right. Bastards! And then! To top it all off, I ordered the bahama mama Rama for my son, so it was supposed to be a treat to have the ice cream on the bottom, yup, non of that either. What the hell dude?! Way disappointed in one of my all time favorite places :(

Huge selection of wigs and extensions clothes, jewelry, trinkets etc. keep in mind everything is cheaply made Chinese crap, but everything is decently priced. I bought a elbow length three tone wavy wig for a girls wig night and paid 26 bucks. Obviously synthetic, but I've bought several of the same quality from other shops and paid 5 times as much!!

We've been here for about 2 months now. So far so good. I'm not too thrilled about the actual apartment, but that has nothing to do with them, and more to do with the fact that I didn't speak up more in decision making time with my husband. The office staff seems very friendly and helpful. Kylie, I believe her name is, she's great! Matthew, I've spoken with him a few times on the phone, he's hilarious. Michelle, I believe she's the main maintenance gal, she's flipping awesome! It's a bummer that the gym and front area is still out of commission. There seems to be quite the bee problem here. We've been stung a few times, but, this IS arizona.... And the rest of my gripes have to do with the apartment itself. But again, my fault and not there's. So happy to be back in Scottsdale and out of GILBERT!

I called several times prior to arrival to set a reservation for a birthday. No answer, nor was there an answering machine message recorded. You have access to set reservations on Open Table, but again, no message was received that THEY WERE ON VACATION! We drove the nearly 30 miles to eat for a party of 7, three vehicles, only to find the restaurant was closed! What a great birthday dinner surprise! NOT! We went up the street to Flemings, they got our business instead.

We went here for our anniversary dinner. I wasnt that impressed. My husband picked out this resturaunt because of the other rave reviews.   Honestly, I felt like I was going blind with the very dim lighting. I understand its for a romantic feel, but maybe a light or two above each table would help?? When i see poor lighting like this, I feel like they are hiding something. When I got my Filet (i know, i know, who orders a filet at an italian resturaunt? keep reading about how the server answered my questions and you'll understand why i decided to go with the "safe bet") it only emphasized my feelings. I ordered a medium - medium rare filet, and it definitly came out closer to well done. I didn't find that out til after i took a bite into it, and immedietly spit it back out. The wine flavor isnt my thing, and the well done thing isnt either. My dog loved it though! =)  When i asked the waitress about a certain dish, she replied back like I was an idiot. Rather than answering a yes or no question on a sauce, she detailed the process of how the sauce is made, still without answering my question. Maybe that was lack of communication. Had it not been my anniversary dinner, i think i would have dug more for my answer.  I did enjoy how the cook/owner of the resturaunt came and greated our table, and asked how our dinner was. That was a nice touch. But our server didnt pay much attention to us regardless of how few people were there. All in all, I kind of wish my husband had taken us across the street to Postino's rather than here. I probably should have voiced an opinion here or there, but again. It was supposed to be a nice night out, so i didnt want my husband to think he had done a horrible job in choosing a resturaunt. But later, when we discussed it, he said i should write a review, just so others could get a heads up! If you're looking for a nice, dark night out, to keep to yourselves, where you could probably get a bit frisky in the corner if your adventerous enough! this may be the place for you!

I came here to get some skin tags removed. The procedure isn't quite so painless, but it's fast and the tech was very nice. She talked me through the entire thing and tried to numb me up good. I had a few scattered through my armpits and a bunch across the back of my neck. It's been 5 days and there's only one left to fall off. She did great and I'm so happy with how it turned out!

Not really impressed with this place. We came here for a simple family night out stop.   We received a simple greeting upon walking in the door. Luckily, we've gone to froyo places before so we knew the drill, but I can't imagine how lost someone would be if it was their first visit. There were no sample cups in sight. The original tart flavor was out of commission, which unfortunately was what I wanted. So I had to concoct some weird mixture that just didn't do my flavor buds justice. My husband and son were pleased, hence the 2 stars. But the toppings were even lacking. The fruit looked subpar and demolished. The boba balls (is that what they're called?) were all popped and liquified. It took me a minute or two to finalize my cup and when I got to the counter I felt like I was getting devil eyes from the girl behind the counter, but that easily could have been me feeling bad for being so disappointed. I honestly won't be requesting to keep this stop in our weekly family outings.

This place was such a wonderful find! We had family in town and wanted to find something we could all enjoy that wasn't too hoitey toiety, but wasn't bland and turned out like Denny's. I'm not gonna lie, when I first showed up, I contemplated arguing to find somewhere nicer. They have a very plain store front, with lunch specials scribbled in marker taped to the window. But we sat down because some of the best places are hole in the walls. Service was so so. It was pretty busy, so I'm hesitant to take a star off for that, but it was a Sunday morning at 10! Anyhow, outside of the service and appearance, the food was FABULOUS!! The apple baked pancake my mom got was amazing! My build your own omelet was a perfect serving with fresh mushrooms and onions and spinach. The fries are like country fried potatoes with a delectable seasoning. My son devoured his chocolate pancakes. My husband had a mix of everything and was pleasantly plump upon departure. We will totally be back, and hopefully it won't be as busy so service isn't as blah.

My husband and I both had tattoos done by Anthony and Apryl earlier this. This was my husbands first tattoo so he really doesnt have much to compare to. Not that i'm so much more tattoo experienced than him, but i do have two smaller ones to compare to. And i have to say, by far, apryl has the lightest hands. I had a good 6-8" piece done on my side/rib area, and the process was nearly painless!!! the work that went into both our tattoos are amazing. We both get many many compliments and cant thank Anthony and Apryl enough. Their shop is spotless, almost borederline OCD spotless. I dont think i've even seen their magazines out of place before! These two make a great team!

I've never really had a bad experience at a teppenyaki restaurant before. Each has their own flair and characteristics that make them stand out from the rest. But this place, this place was repulsive!   We walked in and saw a family of three sitting at a teppenyaki table. No drinks or appetizers had been placed at their table yet so we thought we scored on getting a seat at a table right away. But alas, they told us, their order had already been placed. Next table wouldn't be available for 20 minutes. Ok, that's fine, so we sat at a regular table.   We ordered some iced tea and gyozas to start off. Tea was horrible to say the least. Gyozas seemed like they were frost bitten but the sweet sauce covered any ill flavorings.   At the advice of the server, I ordered The Godfather roll. Now it wasn't too shabby, but for 13 bucks, I expected a little more flair, but it came out slightly boring. But thats when I noticed someone go over to that family of 3 and start taking their order. So much for already having put their order in!!! Wth?!  Onward to the entrees. Now where do I begin... Tonight, they were offering a special on steak dinners which should have been a red flag, but I couldn't help but think BOGO?! Hell yea!!   When our soups and salads came out, oh my, were they bad. The soup seemed to be the bottom of the stock. It was way too overpoweringly salty, cloudy, and just down right disgusting. Salad, I'm not a big fan of salads served at Asian resturaunts, so I don't have anything to compare to, but my husband said it was just as bad as the soup. After waiting what seemed like an eternity, our food finally arrived. And it was COVERED in pepper. I mean, drenched. Now, I love pepper. More than the average person, but that was intense. The fried rice lacked any depth in flavor, I mean, besides the pepper. The steak was tough and also fatty and held no flavor. The veggies, you can't go wrong with veggies right?! Wrong! Now, I don't make it a habit to spit food out at a table, but that was so raunchy, it came right out. It was so over salted, holy Hell. The shrimp was frost bitten and over cooked. Oh man, Our meal was such a miserable mess. And to top it off, service was sub par. The server wasn't bad, but the place was so understaffed, it was hard for her to keep up. And sadly, it wasn't all that busy, so I really don't know who to be mad at. Regardless, we won't be back. Sad way to start my weekend.

I did a transfer from the rock canyon location. The transfer was incredibly smooth. I was so excited to move here, it looks so beautiful! Granite countertops, open floor plans, long hallways, nice garages, great amenities, etc. But then we started living here. I was told by the manager it was a quiet environment here. What a crock. There's constantly some noisey kids running through the halls, yelling, screaming, stomping. It's absurd. Also, maybe I was spoiled over at Rock Canyon, but it seems like the maintenance men don't work at all here at San Tan. I never see them out, there's always dog feces and urine everywhere, and it stinks horribly. And no, it's not the Gilbert farming stench, it's animal nasties. Yes, it's the fault of the people living here, but maintenance should be up on that. Exsp with how much we have to pay to live here. I mean, come on. And speaking of paying, they charge you for parking here! I've never heard of having to pay for parking at an Apt before! I get the garage concept, sure, but for covered parking you have to pay 25 bucks a month. And if you don't, well tuff luck. You're walking a couple minutes to your door. It's cool, god only knows I need the cardio, but it's a little redonkulous sometimes. All in all, this location doesn't measure up to Rock Canyon in any way, shape, or form. BUT it's still not the worst apt  experience of my life. Hahaha I was happy to be able to get cox internet again instead of crappy century link, but cox tv sucks in comparison to directv. The real granite counter tops are better than that fake just look like granite stuff. And I'm super excited to be on the bottom floor. There's also several gas grills and a children play area on site. Office staff seems nice. I'm a little perturbed by the "quiet environment" lie I was given, but I kind of asked for it when obviously they're trying to sell us their location. I dunno, if I could, I would definitely go back to Rock Canyon.

So we moved out a few months ago and was contemplating whether or not to post an update Obviously I decided to. We HATED living at this complex. We up and left and transferred to a Scottsdale location. My husband searched for a new job specifically so we could transfer to a new location without being reprimanded for doing so. We lived in separate homes for almost two months to accommodate the move!! The animal feces was atrocious! The lack of maintenance was ridiculous. The rent payments took weeks to be deducted from our accounts. We were repeatedly told lies. We "purchased" a parking spot. We specifically asked if we could park a trailer in the spot, because our previous apartment we knew that was a big no no. Office response was, "you paid for the spot, you can do whatever you want with it" days later we got tagged and had to jump through some hoops and ladders to find somewhere to take our trailer!! My car got towed one night for no good reason! Luckily, they refunded me the tow fees, but seriously?! Upstairs neighbors never went to sleep. Farming stench? Ugh! I was so excited to go home back to Scottsdale!! And to top it off, we got charged some ridiculous fees when we moved out. My mom went through the apartment with a fine tooth comb and I mean she went a little ape *#%$ cleaning. And they came up with a bunch of bogus charges. Carpet cleaning? Seriously? We were there barely 5 months and I'm super anal about carpet stains. Whatever. We're done with this place. Thank god!!

Not too shabby! It's a real Chinese spot but it's not a hole in the wall. It's actually kind of nice to not be scared to use their utensils!! Hahaha their food is a little bland, but nothing a little chili sauce can't fix!

We came on a late Sunday night, so we weren't expecting an extravagant show. We did still sit at a teppenyaki table. Our cook tried to entertain us, but it's hard to do a show with only 2 people. It's cool. We understood! He was a little heavy on the soy sauce, but you can tell, outside of being a little to salty, everything was deliciously cooked. I would say this is by far better than Benihana or Ah-so's! I docked a star because I got a whiff of something nasty smelling while waiting, maybe it's just that Gilbert stench that I'm not used to??

Well, on first impressions, it was alright. It was a tad bit warm in the restaurant, but I find that to be the norm in Asians restaurants (trying to save money and all). I ordered the pho dac biet, and it was lacking all the delicious meats that come in it. I had rare meat and the bo vien. That is NOT Dac Biet. My husband had the pho tai, and my son had the pho bo vien. There's didn't seem to be missing much, but the pho was served with a side of cilantro, no basil. Um what?! Maybe to the more Americanized crowd that's acceptable, but I made it a point to even let her know I was Vietnamese so she knew not to americanize the bowls. It's common practice here in Arizona because we don't have a large Vietnamese population, they save a few bucks by not using items that a more seasoned Vietnamese eater would notice. The broth tasted flavorful, and hearty. But the dreaded MSG aftertaste came and didn't dissipate for nearly an hour after. What a bummer. I was excited to possibly have found a new pho place to remind me of home.

Stopped by for some lunch, saw this place just driving by. Prices are decent, you get about 3 pieces of a roll for the varying prices. I did get a wiff of spoiled food a few times. I dunno what it was from, but it prevented me from furthering our meal. The service is pretty horrendous, our server didn't even know what siracha was. Asked if I meant eel sauce in a condescending tone. Excuse me what?! I tried several different rolls and was not impressed by any of it. My son had the orange chicken and it was so tangy, he nor I could finish it. I will not be coming back

I recently just moved in and I love it here. It's quiet and calm, I haven't noticed any loud and obnoxious neighbors. Everyone is super friendly. The office is really good about the upkeep too, which can be good and bad. When we moved in, it took us awhile to place a chair properly, so we got a notice. But I take it as the complex is always looking good! Been here about a month and no regrets!

We lived here about 11 months before we transferred to another location in town. This place is amazing! The office staff is great. The maintenance is great, they're even pretty to look at :) comparing where we are now to rock canyon, I would give anything to be able to move back.

My little family has decided to start biking. My son and I picked up some simple bikes from walmart, but my husband did a bit more searching and found this shop. He told me about this bike he wanted that was 3 times what we paid for mine. Whatever, my husband works hard to play hard so I went along with it. The owner of the shop gave us a great deal on the bike because it was the tester. Cool. He was very nice and accommodating.  We went on our first family ride tonight. Holy crap my bike sucked. My husband told me to swap with him to give it a whirl, um yea. My bikes getting returned and I'll be back to this shop to get a better bike. Apparently you do get what you pay for.

This place was pretty awesome. Service is great. Our server was Ashley and she was very attentive! Now, nothing against this place, but my family and I were comparing to The Boiling Crab the entire time, And really nothing can compare to the boiling crab!!! But Hot & Juicy can stand on their own for sure! We ordered clams, shrimp, and crawfish and everything was amazing. We added corn and potatoes and sausage and mmmm!!!! I'm craving to go back! Hits the spot when I don't want to drive 6 hours to LA!

That had to have been the grossest Thai I've ever eaten. My son enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls, but he also eats dirt, so i wouldn't take his judgement seriously. On top of that, the server had given my order to another table, and instead of apologizing, and making sure they hadn't touched my food, went ahead and dropped it off at my table for me to eat. Um, Ew. Pricing is atrocious, the service is not knowledgeable about the menu or the industry period.
