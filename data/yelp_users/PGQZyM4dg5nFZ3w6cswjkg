My mom & I went to Athena for a nice ladies day out. Let me tell you...they didn't disappoint. I went in for a brow and lip wax and 60 minute massage and my mom went in for a 30 minute massage and cut & style. She doesn't get to go to a salon very often so it was a great treat for her. Her stylist was so incredible and helpful. He consulted with her to determine the style she loved and didn't just take it upon himself to do what he thought would look good on her. Our massages were very relaxing and quiet; no motor-mouth massage therapists here!   At the end of the day, she walked away feeling great about herself and that what is what a salon is supposed to do for it's clients. The place was clean and appealing. The staff was courteous and accomodating. I would recommend to anyone!

Went here looking for clothes for my husband and kids. It was organized and I found quite a few things I was looking for. I bought 2 pairs of work pants and 1 pair of shorts for my hb, 3 baseball shirts for my son, 1 shirt for my daughter, and found the Scene It DVD game - all for $45!! The pant were Eddie Bauer and Levi brand, the girls shirt was Childrens Place, the other boys shirts were Under Armour, Champion, and a random other brand. I really like it here and will continue to shop. They had a great sofa and oversized chair for $99 bucks! Would have bought if I needed it! They have a truckload of books, clothes, good amount of shoes, purses, plenty of toys, electronics...thumbs up for sure!

I absolutely love the ambiance and decor at Abuelo's! Being Hispanic, it truly reminds me of childhood memories and it feels wonderful to be in such a place. I know some people have been disappointed but each time I've been there, the food has been great and the service is also good!   I'm not giving them 5 stars because while the food is good it's not absolutely authentic and mouth-watering. If you are looking for a nice place to take the family or your date, I would definitely recommend Abuelos! **Also their happy hour is awesome! $5 fajitas! $2 Coronas! $3 layered dip! Can't be beat!**

Ok, so I'm hispanic and live in Surprise, AZ so the reason for the 4 stars is because I have a couple of Tia's who are amazzzzing cooks. It's hard if not impossible for any Mexican restaurant to earn 5 stars from me. I love this place so much though that they know my family by name and greet me like I'm their long lost cousin - again I think it's a Hispanic thing.   Ok so the restaurant itself looks a little like the meeting place for the Mexican Mafia but I never eat inside, so moving on. They make everything fresh so you might have to wait 10-15 minutes if you order drive-thru but trust me; it's worth every second of your waiting. Their menu is basic but delightful. I usually get the machaca and egg burro but will sometimes mix it up with the breakfast burrito of egg, cheese, and bacon. Their salsa is very good and is great on anything. Skip on the guac..looks a little like runny slime. The flautas are delicioso and so is the carnitas. They serve menudo and sell fantastic tamales at Christmas time. The prices are great and they are open 24 hours - JACKPOT!   If you are lucky, you might spot Alfredo walking around with a cowboy hat and cookin it up in the back for you. I love this place so much my family paid for a couple of burritos for me in advance for my birthday! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.

If you can avoid going to this hospital I would STRONGLY recommend doing so. Your wait time in the ER will be at least 2 hours and then another hour waiting for someone to come see you. If they start you on antibiotics, you can expect another 60 minute wait for your medicine. We had a recent incident that I can't go in to for privacy reasons but all I can say is potential lawsuit. Every time I have come to this hospital there is a hassle, staff always takes the path of least resistance, and are sometimes just downright unhelpful.   I have also heard horror stories from other people about Del Webb. I'm normally not a complainer and usually have great experiences wherever I go, but it has been one thing after another with this place. If you can, drive another few miles to Arrowhead, Estrella, or Thunderbird. Even though they are all Banners, Del Webb must not invest in their staff or just don't care but whatever the case is, compassion and care is not anywhere on their list of priorities.

I used to live in Surprise and this was the go-to salon. They have great prices and the staff is very friendly! The salon itself is basic but nice. My stylist Tessa did an amazing job and really listens to what you want. She is up to date on what is trendy and understood what I wanted. They have quick appointments too! I also had my brows and lip waxed which was done to perfection. I haven't used any other stylists but Tessa and Brandi but both were great and I would certainly recommend this place for anyone who is sick of paying $70 for a $40 dollar haircut because of location!
