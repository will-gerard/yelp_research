Wow... So I ordered 3 photo books spent 2 days customizing them and hit the "same day pick up" option. It showed me several stores at which I could pick up and I chose this one. My pick up time was 7:15 pm. I showed up at the pick up time and was told by the gentleman who works the photo department that they were unable to make these because they were out of ink. Why they didn't call me when they received the order I don't know.. But these were Christmas presents and I needed them tonight. I asked them what I could do and they said they were calling around to get the ink from another store. The manager then told me I would need to drive and pick the ink up if I wanted these done tonight as his staff didn't have cars. So i drive just a few miles down the road retrieved the ink and came back. Keep in mind I already asked if they could just transfer my order and they said they couldn't. So as I handed them the ink he told me it was the wrong kind. At this point I'm pissed but all I care about is getting these books. He told me unfortunately there wasn't anything they could do and would refund my money.. Which I didn't want I want the photo books I ordered. Before just giving up and running with my money I called the online customer service number and in 2 minutes she transferred my order to another store. Yes I was retarded for not just doing that myself at the beginning... But I trusted the manager of the store... Whatever you do do not assume if it says your order will be ready that it truly will. My mistake that I won't make again.

I would like to give them some credit.. They gave me two free books and a store credit when I went back. At least they made it right. Thank you Alex (store manager)

I hate saying negative things about people or businesses because you never know what's going on in their life to cause them to be rude to you, however Lori's Grooming has permanently scarred my dog. I used to bring my cocker spaniel here frequently it was close to my house and she would always get her in last minute. My dog was 5 when I started taking her to Lori so she had been to the groomer hundreds of times and never had an issue. After about the 6th or 7th time at Loris she would start to shake uncontrollably when we would even get close to the front door. Sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified. This reaction was new she had never acted like this with any groomers and still, tho not as bad, has this reaction when we go to the groomers.  I feel Lori had either been extremely aggressive to my dog or just treated her terribly, bad enough to cause her to react this way. Tho Lori was never a very pleasant woman I would have never expected her to harm my dog. Be weary of this groomer. Unfortunately there is no way to prove she did anything to my dog, if there were I would have her in jail, but you know your animal and she obviously was terrified of Lori. If you pet is like your child please watch that she is not being harmed.  I give one star because she would always get her in last minute.

This bar is a staple in scottsdale! I think they've been open 10 years must be doing something right. Hot woman dancing on the bar and great service! The staff greets you at the door and makes sure your drink is never empty. You will not go thirsty in this place.. If you're looking for great drink specials, awesome people, woman swinging from the rafters and great service you have arrived! Best nights are Wednesdays they have a killer wet shirt contest. FYI try the body shots. Only downside is having to take a cab home but that too is provided for you.. There's always a line of them out front. Cheers!

My best friend took me here one night and being strait I figure it would be your typical run of the mill gay bar, which I like just seems to me they are all the same.. Not this bar! They play great music have a super awesome friendly crowd and awesome drinks. I will say a bit pricey but its scottsdale everywhere is pricey. Plus you get what you pay for here, unlike most scottsdale bars where you pay $16 for a double and you're lucky to get a single. Our server Abryan was awesome! Super attentive, funny, always remembering our drinks and recommending new ones.. He would up sale us which we didn't mind it was always to something we liked and he was never pushy about it... A good server/bartender should always up sale. The bathrooms were clean and didn't smell like stinky drunk person funk. Super fun bar that you have to check out!

They get u in fast and are reasonably priced but do not come here if you want anything other than a solid color or French manicure... They refuse to keep up with times and can not give you anything other than a five dot flower. Even when you're holding a picture right in front of them. I keep coming back because I try to be loyal on the hopes they will give you anything outside of the typical 80's style manicure but every time I'm disappointed. Think it's time to go somewhere else.

I've been going here off and on for 5 years and the customer service here is amazing! I went on a no Starbucks strike for about a year not because I don't love my Starbucks but I purchased a very expensive espresso maker and wanted to get my money's worth from it.. Anyways I have a thing with touching cold stuff so I always get a sleeve on all of my iced drinks so after a year of being absent I drove thru the  drive thru ordered my venti iced Carmel macchiato and sure enough they remembered me and put my beloved sleeve on my drink! Love these guys especially the long haired skinny one. They are always so nice and remembered how I like my coffee after a year of not seeing me!   Great customer service!!

By far one of my favorite places to eat! Great atmosphere but the best is the food! We were in there on a Saturday night and ordered the ribeye steak... It was cooked perfect! If you want great food cooked perfect this is your place! Our compliments to the chef.

These guys are amazing!! Chris came out to my house the very next day after calling.. Someone had watched my house while I was out of town and after I had been back found out they had bed bugs in their place. I also spend a lot of time at their house and was getting bites all over me. So I figured they either brought the bed bugs with them when they house sitted or I was bringing them home with me when I would visit. After Chris came out to search my house, a very thorough, search he found no bugs and stated I was probably getting bit at their house. As a preventative measure and at a very low cost he sprayed my house and even gave us a package deal to treat the other house so I wouldn't bring the little hijackers back.  He was super informative and went above and beyond to alleviate the problem. I was adamant to do the heat treatment and was convinced I had these nasty bugs in my house. He was honest and told me there were no bugs. I believe other companies would have taken advantage of my complete freak out and given me a treatment I didn't need. As I was more than willing to do whatever it took.   Thank you so much for your honesty and if I ever do get any creepy monsters I will for sure call you guys! Chris rocks!

I called these guys, after buying a Groupon, at 9pm and they were at my house the very next day. I have an extremely large sectional and they didn't charge me the oversized price.. Super awesome of them. Very professional and didn't push other services on me. I would recommend them to anyone! They're nice to look at too!
