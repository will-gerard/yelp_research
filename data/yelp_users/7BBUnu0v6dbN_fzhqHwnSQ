Another visit.  Returned my orange peel beef again.  They consistently cook it to the consistency of a cremated piece of wood.  I returned the dish and asked for king Pau chicken instead.  Chicken was great, but the accompanying brown rice was ice cold.   Just can't seem to get things right here.    I'll try going to the one on Gilbert road instead.

Great place to eat.   The food is great, service is excellent, and the owner is always pleasant.  Its a bit of a drive for us, but very worth it. Love the Montoya Skillet.

So I went to ask about guest passes for my 13 year old son that I would like to start getting to the gym.  I was told by the general manager that the only option was to get him a membership.  When I mentioned that other gyms offer guest passes, I was told "We're a 700 something thousand member corporation, we can't just give away memberships" (not what I was asking for).  He then eagerly pointed me to the front desk, where I could cancel my membership.  Thanks for your candor, and the totally "I don't give a $h!t attitude.  Here is my bit of honesty.  I don't care how big you think you are, you provide crappy service, you don't get my money. If you had thrown 3-4 passes my way, you might have still had my business.  Your indifference made my decision easy.  Cancelled. Cheers.

Great group of people that make you feel welcome.   Both my kids love going to see Dr. Goodman.  We were lecturing my 8 year old about eating too much candy, and he simply replied that we shouldn't worry 'cause Dr. Goodman will fix it.  What do you say to that?

I have used other companies in the past, but really have to say that these guys are top-notch.  Robert did a fantastic, and thorough job inspecting my system.  He highlighted things to be aware of, and took the time to explain things that I was curious about.    Thank You
