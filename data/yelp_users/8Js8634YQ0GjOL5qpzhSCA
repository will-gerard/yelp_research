We stayed here and rented out the whole place for our wedding. Tom and Debby, the owners and innkeepers, couldn't have been more welcoming and warm.  They were amazing during the entire wedding planning process, very accommodating during our stay, and helpful as we were moving things around setting up for the wedding.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking! We can't wait to stay again soon, just to get away from the city and see the sunset.

We had purchased an item from Etsy for our wedding, which came in and was not anything near what we had ordered. With only 2 weeks until the big day, the only solution was to try to create the item ourselves.  For anyone who doesn't know, a lot of nature-based religions have a ritual of binding the couple's hands together as a symbol of unity during a wedding ceremony. This sacred cord is what we were seeking, and imperative to our ceremony. We had no idea how to make it, but knew it was necessary. Off to local area bead stores we went!  With no judgement, the two ladies working in this store jumped in and were more helpful than I could have ever expected. Their selection was incredible, the quality of the products was impressive, and the staff exhibited extraordinary customer service.   Thank you thank you thank you, for helping make such an important part of our big day possible!

Honestly, if I could give a negative number on the star scale, I would.  Everyone I knew absolutely RAVED about this place, so one evening, my family and I went. The service was awful, the food was cold, and they brought me out food with an allergen on it (which I SPECIFICIALLY told the server about). We chalked it up to the thought that this place is known for breakfast, and we were there in the evening. Our fault; let's try again in the morning sometime.  So we did. Again... epic failure. The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and we had to ask repeatedly for someone to even bring our drinks  (yes, that's part of service, but deserves its own mention). It's been a few months now, but I just can't see going back.  Why do people like this place? I'm so confused when I see lines out the door. Was it just that we had 2 bad experiences that were flukes?  I can't see that.

I literally eat here around once a week. It's clean, fresh, affordable and delicious. And NOT a chain restaurant. Everything I want in a restaurant!

Amanda has been doing my facial waxing, and she's just great! She is professional, friendly, and does awesome work. I really recommend her!

One of my favorites! Everything on the west side seems to be a chain restaurant with very little flair or flavor.  This restaurant has great food, a friendly staff that has obviously been carefully selected,  and a comfortable, casual atmosphere.   Literally, the only complaint I can make is that I wish they were open on Mondays! I'm off on Mondays, and like to eat lunch out. I guess if that's my biggest complaint, it's not too bad, huh?

The west side has been in need of a cool, privately owned restaurant with an awesome bar. Everything on this side of town is a chain, and this restaurant is a breath of fresh air.  The atmosphere is fun and hip, with old movies playing in the background and a chalkboard wall with interesting quotes written on it.  The menu isn't overwhelming, but has a nice variety with differing options for those with dietary restrictions. I've been here several times, and have had  both the meat and black bean burger options (both incredible, btw), and tasted my dining companions' food. EVERYTHING is good. Like, everything.   Do yourself a favor and try the meatloaf, cuz Asiago mashed potatoes.... You're welcome.  Oh! And that beet juice cocktail. Get that, too! Have fun!
