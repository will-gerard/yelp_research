If you are looking for local culture, this is it. As a recent transplant to Phoenix, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local Native American cultures. This is also a must visit when people visit you in Phoenix. What I especially love about this museum is that it presents the Native American cultures as living, breathing peoples and not in a museum/"under glass" sort of manner. There is a lot of information here, and it is presented clearly and coherently.

To be fair, I should start by mentioning my deep and abiding love of cheese. Seriously, this is like a joke among my friends and/or anyone who has been to whole foods with me. So, when I find a place with a long wine list and some adventurous cheese choices, I tend to fall and fall hard.   Discovered this place after going to the Friday night Art Walk. It is right across from the Downtown Phoenix Public Library where we parked. Needless to say, we were thrilled with our choice. The cheese selection here is deep and the wait staff is knowledgeable. The wine selection is also great.   I had a chicken dish that was excellent and my husband, as usual, ordered the steak. My friend who was with us is a vegetarian, and we all appreciated the fact that there were several vegetarian selections available.   The atmosphere here is very laid back and we all lingered over wine and dinner. Near the bar they were showing an old James Bond film on a large screen. in french. which somehow made the place feel all that more sophisticated and charming. I will def. be back and would recommend this place for a long meal and, esp., a post-art walk nosh.

DBC is very interesting in that it really showcases how lively the desert is. This garden excels at highlighting local flora and fauna and seems to dare you to redefine your idea of the desert around you. I have been to gardens all over the world, but I must say this one stands out.    I would encourage anyone thinking about visiting to check the website first as there are lots of special programs. When I visited this summer, DBC was doing night walks, which were a great way to enjoy the gardens and beat the heat. Docents were stationed throughout to highlight different plant and animals species and to talk about the adaptations it takes to make it in the desert. Def. a cool, different way to experience this attraction. Also, I learned how an agave plant is turned into tequila, which is pretty darn nifty.

This place is really not great. The fajitas are, to be generous, merely ok, and much of the fare is actually bad. but i go here weekly. b/c it is in my office building and the other option is quizno's. so, i would mainly recommend this if you work in my building and are too lazy to walk to quizno's. god, that's sort of a depressing thought...

While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service.   I was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.  She said she could not do that. No substitutions.  So, I asked "why?" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.  Her reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.  Huh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?  I tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.  Yep, I might tell other people.

This is a beautiful store! It is small, but it is like a little jewel box. The service is friendly and the selections are really nice - lots of great DVF and marc.   The beauty area is lovely and the perfume counter is amazing. It is small, but, for once, the people working the counter actually know a lot about fragrances! For a perfume junkie like me, this is so much better than the usual perfume counter experience!  The alterations department is also great. I am a short girl, so it is always important to know about this kinda stuff. They actually altered my wedding dress, which was a designer dress from another Saks location, and did a great job creating a train and taking it in - all in one fitting (I was a bit late...).   And, the shoe and handbag departments are like candyland. total fantasy!!! it was all i could do to keep from grabbing something and running like hell... :o)

There is a reason this place is a Phoenix foodie institution...simple fare and baked goods done to perfection is a cool, artsy setting. everything is fresh and flavorful and it is fun to browse the market while waiting. Absolutely charming.

Love this place! I moved here last year from Orlando, which has a suprisingly robust Vietnamese community and tons of great places to get Vietnamese food. I was thrilled to find this near my home and the food is great.  I usually get the chicken pho, which is very good. It comes with sprouts and spices like cilantro, jalapenos, scallions, etc. that you can add to the broth. This allos you to make it as mild or spicy as your mood demands and allows you to play "chef" a little, which is an added bonus.

A good place to find fun, modern and retro-modern furniture and gifts. It is not exactly an "art" store, but they do carry some more popular modern housewear lines like alessi.

After moving here, I was concerned with finding a pleasant, clean nail salon that would not break the bank. Allure is my answer. While there are not a lot of frills, the store is always clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. This is what really elevates this salon - come here a few times and they treat you like an old friend. Also, they are open late (until 7 PM most days), so you can swing by after work for services, and they have even stayed late so I could get a fill finished for a major event. Appointments are not necessary but are recommended.

I have to agree with Kristin S. After an incident of which I will not speak occured with my old salon (ok, i will - i got bumped from my regular appointment by some woman who walked in with no appointment and claimed to have a "nail emergency." she was not bleeding, and, well, i get my nails done regularly but have never declared a "nail emergency." oy!) I tried this place out. It was clean, friendly, efficient and affordable. Def. call for an appointment b/c they fill up fast and otherwise you can never get in. So far the best nail place in Scottsdale, and I have tried a few...

DO NOT go here. Have been going here for 3 years and quality has gone way done. Now, my diamond ring has been "lost" under some questionable circumstances, and they are refusing to help me or look or do anything. Don't let this happen to you.

Overall, I was pretty impressed with the Phx Art Museum. While the collection is not quite world class, the facility is nice and the art is worth a look. The collection leans heavily towards modern and post modern art and there are always several travelling exhibits on display. Def. worth an afternoon and a nice change of pace from the usual. The sculpture garden is also worth a visit - very peaceful and relaxing.  Also, the museum store is a lot of fun. I always love museum stores b/c you can find unique, thoughtful and/or witty gifts that support the institution.   On site there is an Arcadia Farms cafe. Similar to the one found at the Heard, AF specializes in a broad range of cuisine with a New American flare. I have tried several dishes and all have been quite good. If you are in the museum and hungry, this is a great place for a bite. AF also looks out onto the sculpture garden area, which is a nice touch.  Def. check this place out. Also, FYI...the museum is free every Tuesday from 3 PM to 9 PM and on First Fridays from 6PM to 10 PM.

I took my new-ish cat here for a laser declaw surgery. After fileting my furniture and person, I decided it was time...I called several places around town who quoted me upwards of $700 for the surgery. I ended up at Anasazi b/c they charged $350. My cat got excellent care and has recovered well. They were flexible with scheduling and handled my cat well, which can be a chore (he is "spirited" to say the least).

Last Thursday, I had to take a friend to the ER at the Grayhawk/Thompson Peak branch of Scottsdale Healthcare, which was wonderful (five stars - I tried to post a review but it failed twice). Then, the following Saturday, I had to take ANOTHER friend to this Hospital. Also five stars.   On a Saturday night, my friend and I had very little wait. She was given a bed almost immediately and saw a doctor within minutes. Even though I am not family, I was allowed to accompany her with her consent. This is really refreshing as I have run into draconian family-only policies before, which basically adds more stress to an already stressful process.   The doctor was very thorough and took into account my friend's cost concerns regarding testing and her prescriptions. Thankfully, my friend's condition was not terribly serious and we were in an out in a matter of hours! The staff was very friendly and accommodating and made sure that both of us got instructions for follow up and did not have any questions. When we did have questions later, at a separate pharmacy, our calls were promptly answered and our concerns addressed quickly.   Husband was left in the waiting room, and he reported that he also had a good experience.   Overall, five stars for fast, friendly service, doctors and nurses who care, and for excellent follow up.

While I am generally a fan of Nordstrom's, the clothing selection at our local branch, for both men and women, has left me thoroughly underwhelmed. The choices tend to be a bit older and more conservative. I may be a lawyer, but good God I do not want to dress like one all the time. However, if you need a polo shirt, this is your place.   That said, the shoe dept. is amazing. They have a full range of sizes and will order it for you if they do not have it in your size for free. I have child-sized feet, so this is super helpful as Nordstroms is often the only place I can find shoes in my size that do not prominently feature cartoon characters. I lurve me some hot shoes, and this place always has them.   The beauty dept is also pretty great. Heaven for a make-up queen like me! Nordstrom carries lots of brands, including some smaller beauty brands that are harder to find. The MAC counter here is the best in town - the staff are friendly and helpful. Though I am an ardent MAC girl, I often find myself standing in their branded stores unable to get anyone's attention...Not so at the Nordstrom's MAC counter. They also have a large fragrance section, though it lacks the depth one would hope for and mainly deals in major designer brands.   Finally, Nordstroms does have a really cool service tied to their website that is worth mentioning. If you find something on their website you can check to see if it is available in store. If it is, you can buy it online and pick it up in the store, totally avoiding shipping costs. This is a great feature for last minute gifts and can save a ton of time and legwork...which may be important b/c those beautiful shoes are not always made for walking...

Husband secretly got reservations here and surprised me with a "date." Well played, Husband.   Really enjoyed the experience here. The ambiance is very cozy - neutral tones, candlelight, live guitar and piano - tres romantique. The wine prices were very reasonable, which was a nice surprise at a French restaurant.   We split the escargot and onion soup to start. The escargot was very good, as was the soup. Husband had the beef bourguignon, which was excellent. I had the coq au vin. It was not the best coq au vin I have had, but it was very tasty and tender. Both were served over mashed potatoes, which, though not traditional, made for a nice presentation.   For dessert we had the creme brulee. This dish was not impressive. It was underdone and still a bit cool and watery. This was a bit surprising as creme brulee is the sort of dish that can be made in advance and them caramelized at the last minute. A few more minutes under the pastry torch would have done worlds of good.   Overall, though, this place was very good. For French cuisine it is fairly reasonable. The service was very attentive and nothing about the place was stuffy or fussy. A great place for a date.

This is a great place to tour if you love architecture. Having seen several other Frank Lloyd Wright homes, I must say I enjoyed this one the best because the guides were friendly and you really got a feel for the home and FLW's vision. Unlike many of his other properties, here you can sit in the furniture and move about pretty freely, giving one full access to the lines of sight which are so integral in FLW's work.   The grounds are beautiful as well. The home is tucked away and only reveals itself once you are upon it, but the views of the desert and Scottsdale are stunning.   The only drawback is the cost. At $30 per person, it can be a little steep. But, if you enjoy architecture, the trip is well worth it.   As an aside, I also enjoyed the shop and bookstore, which sold lots of unique, art and architecture inspired housewares. There is no food or beverage service here, unlike some other local museums, so plan accordingly.

Yuck, yuck, yuck. Went here today during the Tempe Art Fest today. Perhaps I should have been wary of the fact that while there were tons of people on the street, very few of them were in Coffee Plantation. And it was cold outside.   Anyways, went in, waited in line (I was third but it took a while to get served) and ordered a latte. No syrups, nothing fancy, just a latte. 20 minutes later, after Husband has gone outside, gotten and eaten a hotdog and friend Heather H. has procured soba noodles, I finally get my latte. Even though I was third in line. Then, when I open the lid on said latte, I am greeted by the fact that THERE IS NO FOAM. While a latte is not super foamy, this one literally had NO FOAM. Husband and Heather H. said I should request a new one, but I had no desire to wait another 20 minutes. Then I made the mistake of drinking the latte. It was awful and tasted burnt. Ugh.  I am all for supporting local businesses, but they need to deserve it. If you are on Mill in Tempe and want coffee, do yourself a favor and bypass Coffee Plantation, walk a few more blocks and go to Starbucks.

What's not to love in a chocolate factory? Cerreta's is just that - a local choc. and candy factory that is still family owned and operated. You can tour the factory and try the wares on site.   The chocolates are good. Not the best I've had (i could write an ode to vosges, whose nearest outlet is in vegas), but better than your average mall find. The french mints are a must-try! You can walk down the row of wares, creating your own mix all while the scent of chocolate wafts throughout the store. Be sure to keep track of what you are buying, or at home it becomes a surprise grab bag.   The caramels are also excellent - I actually liked them better than the chocolates - and come in a bunch of flavors - espresso, chocolate, amaretto, etc. Cerreta's also has taffy made on site which comes in some AZ-inspired flavors such as saguaro and prickly pear.   A fun stop for all, and would def. make a great local gift.

Had my rehearsal dinner here. Great though standard Italian food for a good price. And, you cannot beat the setting - right of the "Grand Canal" in the Venetian and in sight of the singers and street performers in "St. Mark's Square." Also, catering manager Kelly is wonderful - very easy to work with, prompt and made sure my guests and I were comfortable and happy.

A good place for a relaxed night out with friends. The pizza is good here and comes in several styles, but do not ignore the rest of the menu. the oregano's fav salad is great, as is the fried ravioli with jalapeno cheese. The entrees are good as well, esp. the chicken lasagna. And, the pizookie (cookie dessert) really is amazing. Who does not love a hot, soft, melty cookie topped with ice cream?   The atmosphere is very relaxed, the drinks are pretty cheap, and they do not rush you at all. With the outdoor seating (w/ heaters for the winter), this is a great place to meet friends, enjoy some solid food and relax.

Perfectly prepared French bistro fare in a charming, classic brasserie-style restaurant. The poulet roti is delicious, as is the steak frite and the trout almondine. All of the food is amazing, from the pistachios on the table to the desserts. Of course, this is what you would expect from Thomas Keller, but, unlike many of his other establishments, this one is affordable and accessible.  Love this place so much I had my wedding reception here. Service was excellent and the food was still great, even though prepared on a large scale. Def. check this place out if in Vegas.

When in Vegas, I love to eat. Ok, I always love to eat, but I do consider Vegas a worthy foodie destination. Bradley Ogden's is one of my fav places in Vegas - a great, upscale farm to table concept. The food is straightforward, new American, but done to perfection. A bit spendy, but worth a visit.

Love this place. The perfect respite from Scottsdale and one of my Sunday faves. The burgers are tasty, the drinks are cheap and the campfire is welcoming. I love sitting outside and enjoying this cowboy bar with friends. This place is totally casual and very rustic, but in a friendly, relaxing kind of way. You can also try your hand at horseshoes, which is way harder than it looks.

This place has a cute, cozy ambiance and good food. Husband and I started with the warm brie, which was nicely complimented with plenty and fruits and breads. Unlike a lot of places that serve similar dishes, there was actually enough stuff to use up the cheese. I had the roast chicken, a simple dish that is hard to execute well and husband enjoyed his steak. My chicken was very fresh and well complimented by the sides. We also enjoyed the well selected wine list. Definitely plan to return.

AMAZING! One of the best, most inventive meals I have ever had. After watching Chef Hubert fillet chef-testants on Top Chef, I was intrigued...I came here for a Birthday dinner and Husband and I tried the tasting menu. Pure heaven! The tea smoked diver scallops are divine and the fillet was perhaps one of the best I have ever had. When the waiter asked me if I was pleased, i blurted out, "mmmm...mouth melting meat!" Embarrassing, but true. Desserts were also standout, esp. the basil sorbet. Spendy, but worth it.   Also, the dark, intimate decor is tres romantique. Great for a special occasion.

Ok, this is one of my favorite type of places - the type where you pick dessert first and then plan your meal accordingly. The service was very attentive and, for the record, my steak was very tasty. In fact, my steak was better than the one I had at bourbon steak during restaurant week and for about half the price.   but, the desserts here are truly the stars of the show. there is a reason the brownie is "famous" and the white choc. banana cream pie was wonderful. Seriously, you will want to cuddle with these desserts when you are done.

Went here today for the first time with Carmen W. (my usual partner in crime) after the Farmer's Market ...loved it! The store is full of witty and artsy jewelry, pottery, stationery and other objet, most from local artists. The store is very eclectic and there really is something for everyone. And, the prices are great. As other reviewers have said, this is a great place for last minute gift ideas.   The staff here is wonderful as well. Very informed about the merchandise and willing to help. They also talked to us about some upcoming events. I think this especially impressed me b/c no one was pushy or "too cool for school;" the staff was just friendly, open and willing to chat.  But, what I loved best was the smattering of books in the store. Seriously, they must be in my head, stealing my reading list. So many books here that are truly special. When I mentioned this to a woman working there, she said the books spoke for the store when the staff was out. Wow. Love this sentiment and totally agree. I absolutely love that we have a local store that believes this.  I bought a few cool items - napkin rings/gift tags that were little chalkboards! - as did my friends. I def plan to return and to check up on the reading list...

A great local experience. I love visiting the farmer's market and trying all the great foods. The doctor's hummus is addictive and the artisan cheeses are amazing. I also love the locally produced honeys and the place that sells vegetarian lasagnas and rollitinis. These are wonderful frozen dishes that make a great, healthy, quick and affordable midweek meal. The produce is also wonderfully fresh and the pet treats are very popular at my house. and the cinnamon bread from the bakery table is mouth watering. try a sample and take a loaf home to toast.   This is just a great place to walk around, do some people watching and sample unique flavors. Be sure to bring water, a tote bag, a freezer or cold storage bag and lots of cash. all of this is sold on the premises as well, so no worries if you forget anything. Also, the market continues to the late afternoon, so no need to get up too early.

Love this store. It is pink(!) and orange(!) and glittery(!) and filled with adorable party items, holiday decor and stationery - exactly the sort of things you never knew you needed! Love the selection of personalized stamps and stationery - i mean, who ever has enough personalized stationery?  The staff is very helpful. Elizabeth helped me choose my wedding invites and directed me to some smaller, more artsy designers. I found an invite I loved and they were even able to order custom colors. The invites were beautiful and came in early. Our guests loved them and my maid of honor thought they were so cool she framed one for Husband and I.   As a result of this, I also went here for my bridesmaid gifts, which I had monogrammed (this is another thing I love here - they can and will monogram everything! love, love, love.). Everything came out beautifully and again, early!   I will definitely come back here when I need stationery or invites for anything. The personalized service is excellent and the selection is unbeatable. Compared to the internet, Swoozie's only charges a bit more, but the personalized service is worth it!

The first time I ate here, I was in the middle of moving into a new apartment. My husband and I were not very dressed up, but this was the only place still serving dinner, and we were starving. Despite our casual attire, the staff was super friendly and attentive. The interior may be modern, but the service is old fashioned nice.   I have since been back and enjoyed each visit. While they are not breaking any new ground here, the sushi is fresh and tasty and the cocktails are excellent. There is also a nice wine selection and lots of other Japanese food.   Do not be scared off by the all white, super-chic scottsdale look - this is a good place for a date or an evening with friends.

Husband and I took the in-laws here and he has been back since. Love the sweet corn tamales - if you go, you must try these. Also, the margaritas are very good. I really enjoyed my shrimp enchiladas. They had almost a dozen shrimp in them, which was great, b/c it drives me nuts when you get a shrimp dish with like three shrimp in it. I mean, they are called shrimp, by their nature they are small, so putting three in a shrimp dish is counter intuitive. Husband enjoyed the street tacos, which were also excellent.   Jalapeno Inferno is also nice for its sedate atmosphere. Unlike a lot of other Mexican places, there is a refreshing lack of colorful parrots, which makes it perfect for a nice dinner with out of towners, esp. those who already feel that everything Arizona must feature cacti.

I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!

My husband, some friends and I went to this place for restaurant week. We all sampled different dishes to experience a range of items - the multi-flavored french fries, soups, steaks and desserts. While everything we sampled was good, I was not blown away. My steak was good, but not great, and considering the regular prices, great should be on the menu. Also, the restaurant is one main room with hardwood floors, effectively creating an echo-chamber. This is one of my major restaurant pet peeves - you sit down at a nice dinner only to have to yell across the table. I expected more from Michael Mina and certainly for the celebrity chef-inspired prices. A better steak, and better experience, can certainly be had for less.

While I am not the biggest fan of the whole "Scottsdale" scene, I really like Geisha. Yes, it has scantily clad waitresses and over priced drinks. But, it also has one big selling point: private karaoke rooms.   Some friends rented a "big" room for ten people. It is totally a small place that would comfortably seat six and is furnished with green-ish shag carpeting and a bottle of Grey Goose behind Plexiglas that has been assaulted more than once. Classy.   But, you will not care b/c the private karaoke is so much fun...less public humiliation than regular karaoke, lots more silliness and singing along. I definitely look forward to getting another group together and coming back...   Also, the bathrooms are worth a mention. They have seat warmers and some pretty interesting fixtures.

I should probably start this by confessing that I was raised by Northeastern-liberal-slightly, o.k. majorly - hippie types. As a result, I love anything like Whole Foods almost unabashedly - green, healthy, community minded, pays a fair wage. That said, I do feel this store is great on its own merits.   This is my go to spot when I want something healthy or, in the case of the fantasy-style, squeal-inducing bakery and gelato section (chocolates made on site! macaroons! Napoleons! squee!), something I can convince myself is not all that bad. The soup bars are wonderful, as is the fish counter. And I am hooked on the Asian inspired noodle bowls they serve in the back corner of the store near the never open tapas bar (why? why never open?). The chicken bowl with lemongrass broth is amazing. Def. add the lemon (included) for a tangy, sour, fresh taste.   I also love the natural beauty products area. This is also where many a trip goes astray for me b/c I am distracted by the 10,000 organic/natural brands of face creams and potions and want to try everything. Unlike sephora, WF realizes that there are more than 3 organic beauty lines out there and houses more than a few.   Also great is the natural/herbal/homeopathic remedies section. The staff in this section is knowledgeable and will recommend and guide you through treatments. Also, WF recognizes that everyone is different, so if you buy a remedy, keep your receipt. If it does not work for you, you can exchange the product for something that will. This is great and really allows you to try things you might not otherwise.   The wine selection is also really comprehensive and they have a whole area of local wines (some of which are quite good) and wines under $10, which is a great resource for entertaining.   And the cheeses. The cheeses! Cheese-heaven. Or, imho, actual heaven. Love the broad selection and the fact that they have samples out a lot, which allows you to expand your palette without investing. The staff in this area is great and can really recommend some great cheeses.   One caveat: try to bring a reusable bag or two with you. You will save five cents a bag and avoid being looked at like you have just threatened the check out person's pet. Seriously, last time I had to ask for a paper bag I left stammering that I needed it so my cats could play with it...

Cafe Pino is the sort of place I am totally mixed on. I wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. But, my experience here was odd at best.   Went with one of my friends, Meredith G., after a movie. We were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. Also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were "ok." This quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.  The pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall.

A great place for a quick lunch in Vegas. Mainland has a cute, modern vibe mixed with a bit of Asian traditionalism - think matchbooks featuring pop art portraits of Chairman Mao and Elvis.   The cuisine is reminiscent of Hong Kong style street food - noodle bowls, dim sum style small plates. I went here with a large group of family members and there was something for everyone, all of it tasty. I had a chicken noodle bowl, my dad had a beef one, mother in law got a seafood salad...all yummy and fairly priced.  Will def go back here for an affordable Vegas lunch and enjoy the cute atmosphere.

This grocery is close to my house and has become my go to store, but I cannot say I love it.   First, the prepared foods are very hit or miss. Sometimes the soups are great, other times I am left wondering how there could possibly be an oil slick in a veggie soup, despite the Fry's-produced evidence in front of me (really? how? that much oil in veggie soup?). Really, they may be creating alternative energy sources for all I know.   Also, the layout of this store is impenetrable. Seriously, you can navigate Venice, Italy more easily. Every time I go there to get a few items to make a meal, I end of wandering for an hour and still unable to find one last item. This is exacerbated by the fact that NO ONE WHO WORKS THERE KNOWS WHERE ANYTHING IS LOCATED. Going through this place makes me think I know how say, Vasco deGama must have felt circumnavigating the world...   And, I am also a bit confused by their selection. When you walk in, there is a huge area of books, kitchen items, small appliances, dishes...you could outfit a kitchen here. On the other side of the store there is a huge area of furniture. Real furniture. This seems to me to be a waste of space and makes the "impossible to navigate" issue worse. I mean, who goes in for milk and thinks you know, I will also get a nine piece patio set and a little ceramic pig holding up a "menu" chalkboard while I am at it. Ok, so I totally do this at Target, but at a grocery store it is weird.   And do not get me started on the self check out. While this is a great idea in theory, in fact, I end up screaming at a computerized voice telling me to, "remove item from the bagging area," while I am confounded b/c there is no item in the "bagging area." Eventually, this breaks down and an actual person must, after ignoring you for at least 5 minutes, comes to your rescue. And then you will have to start over again. In fairness, Husband loves this feature, but I just find it extremely aggravating and a waste of time.   But, it is close, so, like with your bad college bf who was "in a band," I still go back. I will say that the selection is decent and the produce section is very nice - lots of fresh stuff and lots of local and/or organic choices. Also, if you shop here, the VIP card is a must. The prices are a little high, and this can save you a bundle. If you can ever find your way out, that is...

When I moved here a few months ago I was sorry to see that this chain of upscale tea shops had not made it to Arizona. So, I was thrilled to see that one opened up in the Biltmore Plaza across from my office building.   Teavana is a unique little store that sells, literally, hundreds and teas and blends as well as tea accessories. The staff is familiar with the product and can brew just about anything on premises, so you can try before you buy. The teas are high quality and there is something here for everyone.   Also, they have great prepackaged gifts. I have given and gotten gifts from here and love it. I def. recommend the one cup tea maker they use in the store - it is an easy way to make one or two cups of loose tea at home without any mess and it is not terribly expensive. A good alternative for your caffeine fix.

This review is for Dr. Kelly Moffat, a veterinarian and animal behavior specialist who works at the Mesa VCA Animal Hospital. Dr. Moffat is one of only a handful of certified animal behaviorists in the country and is absolutely amazing.   Over the summer, I adopted a one year old chihuahua mix from HALO who had been badly abused. Needless to say, it was love at first sight with Rugby, the best, most loving dog out there.   But, due to his sad start in life, Rugby suffered from severe separation anxiety. If I left him for, literally, 5 minutes, he would bark and howl and scratch at door and floors until his paws bled. I tried everything - books, training, home remedies - and consulted with my usual vet at the Banfield off of Mayo. Afraid for his health, I was not sure what to do.  My regular vet recommended Dr. Moffat. I did her online survey and got an appointment right away. While the initial consult was pricey, Dr. Moffat was very thorough and gave us all sorts of techniques to try and went over good and bad products. We decided on a medication and training regimen.  I stuck to the regimen and consulted with Dr. Moffat via phone and email. Let me tell you...the woman is a miracle worker. After about a month, my dog is now normal and can be left alone as needed. I still follow up with Dr. Moffat as needed. She literally saved my puppy, whom I love dearly.  Really, Dr. Moffat is amazing. She is compassionate and realistic. I never felt like I was being judged and she really listened. She was supportive throughout the process. If I could give her a 10 star review I would. As is, I will be eternally grateful to her for helping my Rugby.

First, this Joann's is HUGE! I even confirmed with the staff that it is the largest in the area. It has a great selection and seems to staff people who actually do crafts. This may sounds like a no-brainer but, trust me, its not. As the store is massive, so is the selection. And, the sales have been great lately.  The store is well organized and has everything you could ever hope to find for scrapbooking, card making, jewelry making, needle crafts, and there are tons of fabric and home decor items.  This Joann's also offers classes on a regular basis. I recently attended a knitting class. It was a lot of fun and yep, we all learned to knit.   If you are into crafting or interested in learning something new, this is definitely worth checking out.

While I totally agree with a lot of Yelp-ers who feel reviewing Starbucks is like reviewing water (it's plentiful, we need it to live, etc.), this location really deserves some recognition due to its wonderful staff. I work in the Esplanade and generally, this place is a culinary wasteland. But, at this Starbucks, the staff is truly special. Yes, they serve the same beverages as every other Starbucks, but the people who work here know my name, say hello and ask me how my day is and even start my drink before I have to ask. It is nice to be able to run down, grab a latte and share a friendly moment. I have frequented other Starbucks and other coffee places for years without getting this sort of assistance. So, Five Stars for the super-friendly staff.

Just stopped here during work as this is located in the Esplanade, near my office b/c I needed a quick watch repair. The staff was friendly and my watch was fixed in a matter of minutes. And, as they said it was a simple repair, they did not charge me! I offered to pay, but they refused.   Excellent, old fashioned service. Also, though I was only there for a few minutes, I did note that they had a wide selection of cute fashion jewelry as well as some lovely, higher end pieces.

Had to take a friend here to the ER last Thursday nite. She was very promptly given a room and saw a doctor quickly. Though I was a friend, and not family, I was allowed to accompany with my friend's consent. We both appreciated this a lot.   The ER doctor and nurses were all thorough, friendly and attentive. All testing was performed on site and we were updated regularly. When my friend needed assistance, it was provided promptly.   My friend was admitted and her room was lovely - very un-hospital with hardwood floors, a couch, cable, wifi, movie rental, a mountain view. The patient menu was varied and available 24/7 - we called it a "cruise ship menu." She had surgery the next day and some friends and I were even allowed to go to pre-op. Once the surgery was done, the surgeon came and found me to personally assure me that things had gone well.   Thankfully, my friend is recovering nicely. We were both pleased with the care she received. Everyone was warm and calming in the midst of a stressful situation.   Also, while there I ate in the cafeteria a few times. They serve full, hot meals most of the day as well as sandwiches 24/7. All was tasty. There is also a mini-Starbucks, which was appreciated. Again, the staff here was super-friendly and comforting.   FIVE STARS +++. Good to know this is around.

So, a few weeks ago i absolutely messed up my left shoulder. Then, in my infinite wisdom, I allowed it to get worse until I could not lift my arm over my head. Once you need help getting dressed, it is safe to say it is time to seek medical attention. So, on a referral from a friend (thanks Carmen W.!), I made an appointment with Dr. sarah Peddie.  Dr. Sarah Peddie is great - very nice and comforting, and she made me feel better immediately. It took a few sessions to feel completely better, but I really did feel results right away. And was able to start dressing myself again.   I had several heat-ultrasound treatments, which were so great I am still hoping to find one of those machines on e-bay, and some more traditional massage techniques. They also hook you up with a website that shows videos of stretches and other relief techniques that really help in between sessions. And, it was great to see everything demonstrated correctly.  Now that i am all better, I do anticipate returning to deal with all of life's aches and pains.

I have only visited the DC Ranch location of this place, but, needless to say, i love it. From the excellent coffee to the creative food to the delicious bakery to the cute decor, I love it all. The food is new american with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and local foodstuffs. Lunch and brunch are the main meals, and everything I have tried has been wonderful. My husband loves the rosemary steak sandwich and I love the corn and goat cheese flat bread. We both enjoy the sweet potato chips with curry and the chicken chili. And, no herb box trip is complete w/o a trip to the bakery, where the raspberry crumble bars are outstanding. The caramel apple bars are also wonderful and hit just the right tart-salty-sweet note.

Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Domino's delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk.   But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches.  Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!

I LOVE this store. Yes, it is like all the other Petsmarts, but the staff and services are awesome. The staff are super knowledgeable and caring.  The dog training classes are wonderful! Our dog Rugby is a bit unfocused and hyper, and Suzanne, our trainer, was perfect with him. Even when I was losing faith in Rugby, she saw potential. She was there when we adopted him from HALO and walked us around the store helping us determine what to buy. She also trained Rugby in beginner and intermediate, and even got him from the PetsHotel for his classes while we were on our honeymoon. Suzanne is great and, thanks to her dedication, Rugby is now a canine good citizen.  PetHotel: AMAZING service. We had to leave the "kids" here for almost three weeks when we were on our honeymoon. My cat, Pumpkin, is usually awful when boarded, and she had a great time. Rugby, our dog, also did well. When he got a little depressed, they sat on the floor and hand fed him. Every time I take him to the store now I have to take him to the PetHotel to say hi to his friends. PetHotel is fairly affordable for boarding and your pets will get lots of personal attention.  Banfield, the Pet Hospital: A great value, esp. with the wellness plans. I bring Rugby and my cat Pumpkin here. The vets are great, very attentive and thorough.   This store really distinguishes itself with its outstanding staff and services. Even if it is a drive, it is worth it to come here. Skip the Scottsdale Rd - FLW madness and shop here.

I attended the opening night of The Pressroom & Scandalesque's Fever. Scandalesque was great as usual, and I was impressed with The Pressroom itself. The venue is large but doesn't feel overwhelming, the bars are well-staffed and - finally - a venue with more than 2 ladies' bathroom stalls (no waiting!). The space is flexible and can accommodate aerialist rigging but could be quickly reconfigured for a more traditional club setting. I think it's a promising flex-space for downtown.
