We always have fun there but have to say the service (especially from the older gentelman) totally sucks!!!!!! What a horrible person. He would be the reason. I don't go back. To the owner please consider either training or getting rid of him.

While the scone was delicious the coffee was to be desired and as cool as the place seems you have to know someone behind the counter to get good service.  They had forgotten to make our sandwiches, did apologize and gave us 1 free drink card hmm seems like they could have done better. I don't believe ill be back again too bad some places live by reputation rather than quality!

If I could give less than I would. The portions were adequate but I would actually like to have some meat with my green chili taste was mediocre and I even tried breakfast with great dissapointed I'm so glad the LA Pinata open up across the street! Not to mention mucho macho taco was just as dissapointing.

My first time here and I greatly appreciate the friendly environment it is a community acupuncture so be prepared I would suggest earphones. I'm going back for sure.

Such an amazing place to get your self back in tune from head to toe!!! David always does a fantastic job on my hair and the pedicure was so relaxing feels like walking on air. Top it off a body scrub by George with reflexology CLOUD 9! And even get rid of some unwanted hair. One stop shopping thanks guys!

If I could give a negative star I would but I figure 1 is more if an insult how, if the meat is warm? Can you serve a cold burrito I have given this place 2 chances and I advise everyone please please don't stop at the 16 at location keep going to 7 st or 7 ave locations so very disappointed ted I. This location give the name a bad reputation!

Cool little spot pet friendly space to sit out back. Smelled yummy when you walk in service was good and food was really good I'm looking forward to trying the chili dinner. I had the itlilan sandwich and a salad that I loved. It was just the right amount, oh I'm looking forward to the beer and wine also.

What a joke the service is so incredibly slow and when they finally brought out our order it was wrong! I would not recommend this place at all!
