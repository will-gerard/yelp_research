Food was delicious!!! But service was bad. It was my first time here & I was ordering for my office. When I got there to pick up our order the lady at the front was not friendly didn't even smile ( there was NO line either). I asked for menus to go and salsa. She stated menus were up front I explained I didn't see any as it was my first time here then the salsa part, I tried to ask what kind she turned her back to me & just threw in some. Then when I get back to the office they only sent 2 items in my bag!!! I ordered for 5 people!!!! At least the girl on the phone when I called was nice and apologized for the error on the food

My yorkies came out AWSOME & happy. The opener was onsite & was very friendly. She took the time to make us & my babies feel comfortable. You can see the love they put into the animals there. We will definitely be using them as our permanent groomers. Thank you to all the staff for the beautiful work you have done

I had called inquiring about some information before I make a decision. I spoke to Candi on the phone. She was very helpful and polite. I appreciate her patience as I had several questions. I was impressed that I could hear her smile through the phone. That is excellent customer service. When the time comes we will definitely be taking our business there just from a simple phone call

Never bad service here. The servers are always great every time we come here. I love the different sections of burgers. The bar tender makes delicious drinks each time . I'm a loyal customer

Good is usually good but haven't been seated yet to try it. They have a room full of people standing to be seated, there are 12 tables open but they are NOT seating people stating they are waiting for the kitchen to catch up! That's just dumb it's better to at least seat people than to have them standing to wait!!! Poor management !!

First time here. One of the owners is on the phone just talking loud in the eating area. The other older lady is loud on the phone in the cooking area. Our person that is supposed to be taking our order is to busy texting and not even making eye contact. I'm sorry am I'm disturbing you while you supposed to be taking our order!!!! There's another customer in here he's been standing at the counter to order for 15min now and no one has even bothered to acknowledge him!! So far the customer service SUCKS!!! Hopefully the food is good to make up for lack of service!!! Even if it is good I won't come back just due to poor service!!! Just tasted the food....the food is amazing!!! Just wish the service was the same

All I wanted was some food. I called & they said their cut off street is Baseline on Power rd. I'm on power & Guadalupe. They gave me the number for Jimmy John's on power and Ray I called them they said I'm out of their 2mile delivery restriction and the closest one would be the one on power and southern so basically all I'm hearing is that both refuse to deliver this is poor customer service! I will never use either one of these locations or Jimmy John's in general to cater any more of our office parties after today

Jimmy Johns delivery section is STUPID!!! I live on Hilgley and Brown, they are located on Mc Kellips, they will deliver to Alta Mesa if I meet them on Brown Rd.!!! Seriously? How stupid, they stated they can not deliver south of Brown, only to houses on Brown. I told them the houses that back of the houses are on Brown!! I swear each one has a different rule! When I use them to deliver to my work they make an exception because they dont want to loose buisness from my company, well you just did and no i will NOT be using you to cater anymore of my office funtions either!!

Less than a 2mile drive & they won't even deliver!! This seams to be a problem with certain Jimmy John locations!

The owner was very kind on the phone. He took the time to go over all my question and he even went the extra mile to deliver the pizza & wings himself!! Our first time trying Twisted Pies but definitely not our last!! We will be back for more
