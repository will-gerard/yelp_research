Scott is the owner and the only one who cleans the carpets. This is why he has the same customers for YEARS! He is so trustworthy that lots of his customers, including us, leave him the key to take care of the carpets when they're gone. He has been our only carpet man since the mid- 90's and took care of our restaurant carpet for its 15 years. One interesting thing that many don't know about him is that he can do "carpet art" with the carpet cleaning wand, which is especially loved in the kids' rooms. I have referred lots of people to him and everyone has been thoroughly satisfied. Mister Carpet really is as good as it gets!

The first time that I had a pedicure here, the woman smoothed the heels with the "grater" which did a fine job. However, apparently it is no longer allowed by State regulations. The next time that I went in, a chemical was smeared on the bottom of feet. Since communication was nearly nil between me and the Vietnamese man doing the pedicure, I was unaware that he had just applied a harsh chemical for smoothing the heels. I am extremely cautious about what that I put in and on my body. In fact, I even bring my own cream to the salon, never using the cheap creams full of unpronounceable and unhealthy ingredients.   He placed my right foot in the water. I moved my foot and the water splashed onto my leg above the ankle. Immediately it began to burn! I grabbed a towel and wiped my leg. That's when I asked and understood that he had applied a chemical to my feet that is so harsh that it eats away the calloused skin on the heel.   I told him that the chemical had gotten onto my skin and that it was still burning even though I had wiped it. He repeatedly DENIED my experience. He insisted that it wasn't from the chemical, that I had hurt myself before I came in. I showed him the red mark and told him that it had just happened a moment before. He then told me, as if he were practicing some Ho Chi Minh Thought control, "You hurt yourself this morning in the shower with a razor."  OH MY GOSH! I sat there in pain until the pedicure was finished, went home and applied ointment to the area, which took days to heal.  Later I called to speak to the owner. He never apologized, nor did he make any offer to ameliorate my bad experience.

If you're looking for fresh, healthy, quick and tasty, The Blue Burrito is a sure bet. We recently tried the Shea/Scottsdale Rd. location (NE corner), which has a very attractive bar. The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.  The staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.  As for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings! My husband orders the shrimp burrito, which is really big! I must have the machaca beef tacos and our little one likes the cheese quesadillas. The rice and beans are good sides, but the free chips,  pico de gallo and the available salsas are positively addictive!   This location is now our favorite Blue Burrito :)

I called to make sure that they had what I needed, because it was important that we get it right away. There was only one time in the day where we would have the opportunity to go to Radio Shack. My husband went to get it and there was no one to help. The Sprint employee next door began looking for the Radio Shack employee. Meanwhile, my husband found the item we need. The Sprint girls was calling, Oscar! Oscar!" She came back and said, "There is no one here. He left!"  The Sprint employee couldn't check him out. How exasperating. He had to put down his item and walk out. With all of the people who need jobs, how is it that Oscar is still working there?

When Abe was alive this was the only place any of my family went to for shoe repair. Now we all go to Artisans Shoe Repair on Alma School, just north of Warner. The man who runs Abe's now is snotty, stingy and dishonest enough to charge sales tax on labor.  The last time I was in there, as I gave him my purse to have a strap fixed, I noticed that the purse had a smudge on one side. I said something like, "Oh and you probably clean the outside or polish it or something?" He said that would cost me X amount, because he didn't work for free.  His response was so curt  and defensive that I was taken off guard. Before I could respond, he added, "Go home and wipe it down yourself!" At that point, I should've taken my purse and left.  When I came back to pick it, I saw that he charged me sales tax. I told him that no sales tax is to be charged on labor. He flew off the handle and started ranting about the government charging all these taxes and that it's not his fault and that I should go talk to the mayor if I had a complaint, bla, bla, bla.    Well I did better than that. I called the Arizona Department of Revenue and confirmed that he absolutely should not be charging tax on labor in his shop. Who knows how much money he's stolen from his customers over the years by dishonestly charging them tax? He doesn't deserve anybody's business.

I went in to talk to Dr.Larrabee about the method he would use to expand my 7 year old's palate to correct her malocclusion. He uses braces whereas nearly every other orthodontist uses a rapid palate expander. Even though using braces to expand the palate is over 3X more expensive and takes twice as long,  I came there to learn about it.  Dr. Larrabee seemed proud and didn't like being questioned. He took on a defensive tone when I asked if there were any published studies in The Journal of Orthodontics supporting using braces to pull the palate apart. In a condescending manner as if he were saying something obvious to a backward person, he said, "Yeah, look them up on the internet."  I found his defensiveness strange. I interpreted It as a lack of confidence in his unpopular method. He could only support his method with his opinions.   To me he seemed like a salesman, selling himself directly to my child. He spoke primarily to her; "We're going to do this...." he would say to her enthusiastically.  Or "Would you like......." Even the office is set up to be enthralling to a kid. But Dr. Lararabee made me feel like my questions and concerns were irritating. He wanted to close the sale and I wasn't responding like a wide-eyed child.  I then went to another dentist (see my other review) who uses the only method recommended by the AAO. I questioned him in the exact same manner as I had Dr. Larrabee. The other orthodontist said "I will find articles in the Journal of Orthodontics for you, since you will not have access to those studies on your own." He not only took the time to explain his experiences and conclusions about the two methods, but  found the articles and emailed them to me, Needless to say, I chose the other doctor.

As the person in charge of landscaping for our HOA, I interviewed SEVEN companies specializing in tree care. I needed a 4-story tall olive tree removed that had become an unmanageable nuisance.     Patrick, the owner, came out to give the bid. I felt good about him right away. He is an honest and well-mannered person   He gave one of the lowest bids (the bids differed by $300). He spoke with confidence about the job, explained clearly what it would entail, and happily answered my many questions. The job by no means appeared daunting to him. Contrast his attitude with some of the other companies whose reps would talk about what a hard job it was going to be; the tree was so big, it was close to a fire hydrant, they'd have to flag the ground for water pipes, the tree was too near the carport. Then those companies would give me a high bid.    I selected Arbor Care and when the tree removal day came, my family and I watched with interest and admiration as the men worked with such expertise and teamwork that they didn't even speak. It was especially impressive when one man was in the tree roping huge limbs, chainsawing and then the men on the ground would receive the limbs, disposing of some in a wood chipper, and cutting some for firewood for our community to share. By the teamwork, we could tell that this group has worked together for a long time. They operated so smoothly and professionally.      Then they used a very powerful stump grinder, removed pounds and pounds of sawdust that it left behind. They cleaned up so well that one could hardly tell where the tree had been.    Months later, I recommended them to a good friend who has many trees in her backyard. I went on and on about the company before mentioning Arbor Care by name. She said, "Oh, you mean Patrick!" I was quite surprised that she already had been using them for years, but considering their excellent work and fair prices I shouldn't have been surprised at all.

The excellent waiter who used to wait on us, must have found a better serving job. Without him, the "service" was unbearable.  The woman who took our order was much more interested in watching her reality television program with another girl. The TV was so disquieting that my daughter and I could not enjoy our time. Since it was completely inappropriate for a child, we sat on the same side of the booth with our backs to the TV.  The mustachioed waitress treated us abruptly, sending us the message that she either hated her life, her job or us. She did not listen to the details of our order, she harshly plopped the plates on the table, never asked us how our food was and never refilled our beverages.   She did however, sit 10 feet away from us, slumped expressionless, staring straight ahead at the TV.  My little daughter approached her with an empty cup for a refill and the woman didn't even acknowledge her presence until she was standing right next to her.     The food is not good enough to be worth parking the car, going in and seeing if that miserable woman is still working there. There are just too many other restaurants to try.

Having owned a restaurant for 15 years, I notice everything when I dine and consequently, I am very picky. I am completely at ease and delighted by this restaurant. I really appreciate the freshness of their food and recognize that they do not cut corners on their ingredients. Their broths are WONDERFULLY flavorful. I usually choose a vegetarian dish and my husband likes seafood. We eat here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. Do try a Vietnamese dessert for a fun and delicious experience.  (BTW, they cater to those who must follow a gluten free diet).  The decor is attractive: a lot of windows, black and white photography, pendant lamps, two flat screened televisions on mute, American music at an unobtrusive volume, and what I really like --- the place is exceedingly clean, including the bathrooms!   The owners of Unphogettable are a married couple, who work very hard and have the most hospitable personalities. They not only make the environment pleasant for their guests, but have  created a good working atmosphere, as is evidenced by the happiness of their employees.   In closing, I couldn't be more enthusiastic in my recommendation of Unphogettable.

My mother received a coupon and wanted to try Il Vinaio before a show at the Mesa Arts Center. I had only been for dinner there once before a couple of years ago, and remembered that the service was so deplorable that we were worried that our host was embarrassed to have brought us there. But the restaurant was new and I understand that it takes time to work out the kinks. Turned out that this particular kink has not yet been untwisted.                The service is incongruent to the nice atmosphere and good menu. It's not just that the servers dress in jeans, tennis shoes and, I think, t-shirts, but that the quality of the work revealed the absence of proper training. Ex: no tray-jack, just set the entire large tray directly on our table, serving entrees while all of the appetizer and salad plates were still uncleared, never removing dinner plates, (we had to push the empty plates aside to do the check), no bussers which  decreased the amount of time we saw our server and greatly contributed to poor service.         "Hi guys. My name is N_____. Let me tell you guys about the special." And then she literally began the description with, "It comes with...." She said the entire special backwards so that we had to wait until the end to know what the entree actually was! It went like this," It comes with X and Y over some (pasta?) and then you can get either A or B (fish or chicken maybe)." The way she told it was impossible to get a visual and I was so distracted by the delivery that I couldn't remember what the special was 10 seconds after she "described" it. Oh goodness.         I ordered from an exciting gluten-free menu, which is a rare treat. I chose the braised lamb ragu with pappardelle pasta. My daughter wanted the same dish which was on the regular menu. However she told the server that she would go ahead and get the gluten-free as well, in order "to make sure the [identical] dishes don't get mixed up."  When the meals arrived, the lamb ragu was over CAPELLINI. When I told the server, she unapologetically said, "Oh, angel hair is the only gluten free pasta we have". I told her that my daughter never would have ordered the lamb ragu in gluten-free had she known. Our server didn't do anything with this piece of information to satisfy the problem. This would have been a good time for her to have told the owner that his/her error on the menu had caused two guests disappointment. Maybe at Il Vinaio they think, "Ahh, pasta is pasta. Who cares what shape it's in?"    Uh....we do!            Important note: Ineptitude aside, the lamb ragu was DELICIOUS.         However my father, who just had dental surgery, ordered tomato soup as his entree along with a sweet potato side. I don't believe that the same person who made the lamb ragu could possibly have made that soup. It was very watery and barely tasted of tomato. Dad's incredulity that it was being passed off as tomato soup caused him to want everyone at the table to try it.  And unfortunately for him, the sweet potato mash was not sweet as sweet potatoes usually are. After complaining about the soup, he received the black bean soup. The beans were undercooked, thus hard and unchewable for him. To top it all off, he had ordered an O'Douls over a half hour prior and had given up on it. In our attempt to assuage his suffering, we reminded the server who then brought it.         When she brought the bill, I asked if she had taken anything off for not serving papardelle as the menu said. She replied, "I already took off his soup, sweet potatoes and O'Douls". I reminded her that the beer was 30 minutes late, and that the food he ordered was not good. I should have told her that in the restaurant business, once a drink takes 20 minutes to get to a guest, you give it to him with a sincere apology and it's comped. And when your guests find your food inedible, of course you do not charge them for that either.  Neither of which is a favor.         I then talked to the owner about the menu item switch. She apologized for it. I told her that I didn't mind for myself since I'm just glad to get a good GF meal, but that something ought to be taken off of my daughter's entree since she never would have ordered the dish had she known that it was not as described. The owner did absolutely nothing except to apologize again. I was stunned by the owner's inaction. She  probably figured we were never coming back so why compensate for that particular error. If that was her thinking, she assessed the situation incorrectly. It's so hard to find a good gluten-free meal that I would definitely have gone again.       I noticed a lively bar with about 10 seats. Il Vinaio is probably great for a drink and some socializing at the bar. Also I would mention the GF menu to anyone needing to follow that diet. But I offer a warning about the service.  The establishment is too nice and has too much going for it for the owners to overlook this shortcoming.

The owner really knows his stuff. My whole family goes here and his work is superb. But what's even neater is that his prices are very reasonable. He's a personable guy. It's like dealing with someone from the days when people trusted one another. For example, I gathered up some shoe accessories to purchase (polish and shoe pad) and he told me I could just take them and pay later when I picked up the shoes that he was repairing for me. It made me feel great. I'm very happy that we have found Artisans Shoe and Leather Repair!

When our daughter was 2 years old, she had a mass develop in her neck. We took her to 5 doctors who could not diagnose it before finding the surgeons of Banner Pediatric Specialists, who operate at Cardon Children's Medical Center.   Dr. Pham  took one look at her neck and at the ultrasound and said, "I know what this is. It's a branchial fistula." Then when it turned out to be the rarest form of the problem (1st branchial), he brought in other specialists to assist him. (It was a 3-surgeon surgery that took 4 hours). I later read an article in a medical journal that said  it usually takes parents more than 3 years to get the proper diagnosis for a branchial fistula. So we were grateful to find Dr. Pham rather early on.  He's a smart man, yet humble. He's very easy to talk to and is so kind and gentle with children. He even makes animal balloons for the kids! He really cares about his patients and their families. I thought it was comforting and reassuring that he called me at home twice to check on us. I have great admiration for Dr. Pham and recommend him to any parent whose child needs surgery.

I love Dr. Novelly and Lygia, my dental hygienist! I first went to Dr. Novelly over 15 years ago. My consistently perfect experiences at Novelly Dentistry is the reason my husband, adult daughter and parents all are his loyal patients now. And they all see Lygia, too!   Dr. Novelly is genuinely kind-hearted, patient, gentle, humble,  funny and really good at what he does. I  trust him and can relax. (I used to be a person who would start shaking in a dentist chair).  By the way, his crowns are excellent! Some dentists aren't good at crowns, but his fit like a glove. Also he won't use amalgams with mercury. He stopped using those ages ago.  Dr. Novelly is a stand-up guy. My whole family is pleased to know him and grateful that he is our dentist.

I am only reviewing their gluten free pizza since that is the only kind I can eat.   I went to Jimmy and Joe's specifically for the gluten free pizza. The GF only comes in medium, which for a 2 topping was about $17. The pizza was overcooked and actually black around the edges. Because GF pizza is usually thinner than regular pizza, it's an easy mistake for cooks to make, so I brought it to the attention of Sarah, the girl working the front.   I showed her the dried-out pizza, all black around the edges and underneath. To my dismay, she said that that is normal for their GF pizzas. (Haven't they figured out that the GF pizza takes less time to cook)? As if explaining the reason, she said that they don't make the GF dough there; that it arrives frozen. I should have pointed out that I am sure it doesn't arrive burnt! She actually said, "Next time, tell them that you would like your pizza undercooked."  How about a do-over and cook the pizza properly?  As soon as Picazzo's opens back up in Tempe this fall, I will return there for the best GF pizza in the area.

I found this company on Superpages.com where they had 5 stars. They provided the very best pool cleaning bid for our HOA and included more frequent services than the other companies who bid. This is a family business. The mother, Sheila works the office. She responds quickly by phone or email.I loved dealing with her. She's professional and detail oriented. This is a reliable small business that really cares about their work!

We should have known by the space heater blowing behind the front lobby podium that the owner was trying to save money by not setting the thermostat at a temperature to make customers comfortable. We went there in December and the place was freezing. I asked the waitress and the owner to turn on the heat. The owner said that it was on, when it obviously was not. I replied, "Well, could you please set it higher to warm the restaurant?" She then said that it couldn't get warm because the ceilings were too high. It was so cold that I kept my legs moving constantly to generate heat, I gave my sweater to my little girl to wear on top of hers, my husband removed his sweatshirt and gave it to me and we ate as fast as we could.  My husband ordered soup to warm him and it came completely unheated! The waitress discovered that the soup warmer was not turned on. The rest of our meals were not good enough to make us want to return in the spring.

The service and taste of the food was both bad. At first I thought the waiter / manager was just overwrought from the lunch rush having jut finished. His speech was loud and curt. He moved very quickly, though only one table remained. But after my party of 4 sat down outside, my friend and I realized that he is just ill-mannered. He was rude while we ordered for the two children, insisting twice that we ought to just order them a small cheese crisp and fries. We were not inclined to take his advice which seemed to irritate him. He did refill our drinks without being asked, cleared the plates and fulfilled the basic waiter duties, but he is beyond unfriendly.  I ordered a fish taco plate for my daughter and a carne asada taco plate for myself. The fish tacos smelled bad.The beans and rice were so spicy that my taste buds were numbed. I'm an Arizona girl who has grown up on Mexican food, but this was unpleasant.  I would never return. However my lunch companion recommends the original Fuego Bistro.
