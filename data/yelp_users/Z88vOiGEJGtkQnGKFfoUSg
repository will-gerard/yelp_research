It may be cheap, but being charged $107 for something I did not buy. Is ridiculous!!  Some other guy has my last name and I get charged!  Mandy Hartwell has sent me a receipt but I have yet to see a refund!  It's been 5 days!  Where is my money Ryan's pet store!!

Love this place!!  Ask for Josh.  The only downfall is the horrible slow as a turtle, piano music.  How about some K-Pop or something. I know that's Korean music but it's a start. ;0)

The food and service are outstanding. We have been coming here for a while, hopefully a lot more people will start coming here.  The stir fry dish is A-Mazing.

This place was amazing. When people mention "Sex and the city crowd" that's the stupidest thing I've heard of. Next time, when they open another Julia Baker,  come dressed appropriately.

What can I say, Holly, our bartender fast and friendly! 16oz steak, cooked rare, was perfect. Came with eggs and toast $15.   I had a Godiva white chocolate liquor with my coffee, $6. That's a great price too, considering I usually pay $10 or $11.  When you eat here sit with Holly at the bar. By the way, they are so prompt on pouring coffee!!  Thanks again!!  We will be back!!

Seriously!!! When I Came into this place I thought it was kind of cool we sat down at the bar. I ordered a gray goose on the rocks which was in such a tiny little glass and then a Guinness i then asked the bartender to make my two friends whatever he wanted. After that I had another Guinness 5 shots of apple pucker one shot of Patron and one Jäger along with three shots of water.  That was it. I asked for my bill it took FOREVER!  Then when I finally received my bill it was $146.00. How is this possible?  The bartender then got pissy with me. I serve and bartend and never have I tried to rip off a guest. I wasn't drunk. As a matter of fact me and my 2 friends drank those three shots of water. Which was supposed to be a pretend shot. I guess the other two shots were for the owners. Some girl and some guy.  Anyway I asked the bartender how much a shot a Jäger was. He said $4.50.  So how is my bill $146.00.  He combined a tab with some other guy that we met there. Unapologetic or anything my bill ended up being $50.00. In the future I will NEVER BE BACK.  And anyone new who comes in and try's a new bar, watch out!  Their are thief's among you.  You might pay $19 for a Guinness and $15 for a shot of water!

Where shall I begin, the server came up right away, which is great. We got our food in this humongous plate. Wine in a plastic glass? Seriously? then all of a sudden she disappeared. We weren't asked if the food was great or anything which it was okay it wasn't all that. $27 for a little piece of steak, not worth it.  At least when it came time to get the check she was very attentive. Won't be back. By the way clean up your restrooms that's disgusting.

This place has the best seafood and the best chef, her name is Tip.  She is very friendly with the guests.  I highly recommend the Etouffé  or the pan fry.  Combo on both with dirty rice!

If you order 3 courses make sure you tell them. Everything came out at once.  I wait tables too. It's called an appetizer for a reason.  My second beer took awhile.  P.S. I bartend too. The food is delicious.  No complaints here. The manager seems very nice. :). Excellent happy hour!!.

Hmmm,  definitely not Sophie's anymore. The ambience reminds me of an asylum or hospital, perhaps a big white and off white crate.  :0/. The parsnip soup is amazing. The server is wonderful.

Hmm, as a server/ manager/ been a bartender before. This place is very unfriendly.   The food is alright.  #I should have gone to Sprouts. I was going to make my own dinner, but This place caught my eye.  First and last time.  Sorry, not impressed. If you (the bartender) are the owner, I suggest you don't come to work and let everyone else handle it.  The girl that took my credit card was nice.
