I love this auto shop!  Took my car in for the first time to this shop, and the employees were very welcoming!  Never made me feel stupid because I didn't understand the car jargon, and made sure I understood everything before letting me walk out the door.  Very competitive pricing.  Dave and his team were very professional, even when confronted by mistakes that were made to previous visits, and made sure to make things right for the other customers.  I felt like I was hanging out with old friends, and the price/time frame quoted was right on track!  Even when not at the shop, they are willing to answer questions and provide insight over the phone, and even tow your car to their shop!  I am a customer for life!

I am not pleased with the staff or the venue.  The manager is less than professional, the venue is overpriced, and there is a severe lack of customer service with this.  While I do appreciate the beauty of the building, and the owners are so nice, I would say, take your money elsewhere.

This Dominos is one of the best that I have ever ordered from.  The delivery people are always nice, courteous, and prompt.  They have even had me check my food before they left to ensure that it was to my expectations.  The pizza is always hot and fresh, regardless of the time of day.  I love this Dominos!
