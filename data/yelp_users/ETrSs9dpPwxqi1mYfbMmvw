Three-star service, but five-star ambience=four estrellas. Let's face it, marina restaurants don't have to push too hard to succeed. Competition along the shoreline is minimal. When the cooler runs low on the boat, Lakeside Restaurant is the only show in town. You can tie up at the little restaurant dock, where the sign warns of a 30 minute limit, which is laughable given the snail-paced service. Sit on the patio and toss a few crumbs to the waiting ducks and, further down the food chain, the circling iridescent big-mouth carp. Feathered, scaled, and furry scavengers vie for patio scraps. The water is clear and calm, and the view stunning. The coffee is weak and watery, if plentiful, and the omelettes are big and fluffy, if bland. The heavily inked wait staff is polite if a little rough around the edges, but props to folks who are sturdy enough tackle a full-time wilderness gig like this. Note: these are the best restrooms within 20 miles.

Whole beef dog with everything...crusty, juicy, loaded, wow! The hot sauce here is just fiery enough to kick up the volume on that unbeatable dog. Would that I could've eaten four or five and still kept my girlish figure...

I am haunted by guilt for looking the gift horse of a generous work party in the mouth, but Claim Jumper earned the dental exam. First, our party of 40 was relegated to a chilly patio room where the tables were bolted to the floor, thus stranding groups of four on secluded little islands. I know the tables have to be sturdy to handle the hefty dessert plates, but the steel reinforcement is overkill. One expects slower service with a party this size, but I guess we were out of sight and mind. The appetizers and desserts were especially slow in coming, and adding insult to injury, those who ordered their desserts to go were served a good 10 minutes before those who wanted theirs served. The entrees arrived in such a haphazard fashion that one out of each table wasn't served for a good 5 minutes after everyone else, resulting in a few uncomfortable minutes while we politely waited as our plates cooled and our mates drooled. Injuring the insult with ickiness, the lobster was a rubber-bandy glop of shellfish gone wrong, and the petit filet, not much bigger than a petit four, was tough as cowhide. The sweet potato cakes on the side were dense and delicious with a creamy salsa topping. Had there been more salsa, I would have soaked my entree as well in some sort of liquid as it was painfully desiccated. Speaking of overkill, the desserts will easily serve three average-sized diners. The red velvet cake with buttercream frosting was outstanding. It lasted four days in the freezer. Claim Jumper is just the place for chain lovers who find oversized portions and dizzying prices patriotic and who require steel bolts to rest their elbows safely on the table.

Buried deep in the heart, or the seedy underbelly, of increasingly barren Country Club Drive is a re-purposed chalet-type building that houses the best New Mexico style cuisine this side of the Santa Fe divide. In town for a conference, we had heard positive whispers, and we were rewarded with fiery adobe salsa, dark and rich, with our chips, a peerless pulled pork adobo sandwich which was outrageously delicious, pecan grilled chicken that was moist and flavorful, and all of it popped. The parking lot fills astoundingly quickly as the smart business folk along this corridor pile in as if on cue, but the servers are used to the rush and the staff doesn't hesitate to educate newcomers. Would that they would franchise themselves to Tucson...

Keep driving past the corporate neon chilis and formulaic boredom on Florence Avenue and check out this impressive small-town bistro. Wings: honey and hot, crispy and sweet. Penne with sausage in vodka cream sauce: outstanding. Veal parmagiana: friend said it was among the best he's had and was perfectly breaded. My partner wasn't too excited about his baked penne with meat, and the special of the evening, lobster ravioli scampi, disappointed, mostly because the buttery sauce was too thick and salty. Our server, Angela, was wonderful, even when I asked her to refrigerate the chocolate mousse cheesecake I had brought from the Cheescake Factory (can't risk birthday dessert on an unknown) and even brought extra plates and silver. She was attentive as our crew worked their way through the beer menu. The patio is lovely in the evening with a duet playing country covers and originals, although the music is a bit loud for comfortable conversation. Still, Tommy's has a relaxed, local feel and is tops in Casa Grande if you stick dishes that are standard Italian - those creative specials might be a little too ambitious.
