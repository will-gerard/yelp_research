I have been to other PF Changs and this one by far exceeded my previous experience by far. Our server Brandon was one of the best servers I ever had.  I have been in he service industry for years he was fantastic. This restaurant should be lucky to have him He was professional, attentive,  kind, and he had a good sense of humor.  He didn't let our drinks get empty and always pretty bussed our dishes. He timed our appetizers, main course and desserts in a timely manor as well.  I will definitely come back and request him as my server. Our meals where amazing from the lettuce wraps, dynamite shrimp to the melon shrimp, even our kids couldn't get enough of the fried chicken with honey and sweet and sour sauce. The ambiance was not loud nice lighting music etc. All of the staff here did great from the greet at the door, the seating, the sever,  the runners and even our exit. Thank you for a great Sunday dinner.

Every time I eat here it never seems to disappoint me. The menu is well thought out with a complex fusion of flavors. The service is always on point with servers who remember your name to your favorite drink. It's a small town feel with an upscale uptown vibe. The owners Steve and Karen really put in there heart and souls into pleasing there guests and take there opinions and input seriously.  The food is fresh when I mean fresh it's not frozen it's made to order. For example I love there fish fry Friday I highly dislike coleslaw let alone tarter sauce, until I ordered it and tried it, it was like fireworks in my mouth, will only eat it Here. The coleslaw has a twist it's a little sweet but the perfect balance of salt with a crunch, the fish is not even remotely fishy with the best batter. I COULD Go On and on but take me seriously when I say you must try for your self.  The drinks are reasonable prices and they have a great happy hr Monday thru Friday.  I Enjoy fresh ingredients and Enjoy Being greeted By People who Remember MY Family and ask How We are doing AND honestly care. Give this place a chance and you will won't be sorry.

BEST seafood in AZ I had I pound of softshell crab and 1 pound of lobster.  I had the garlic and mild spice.  It was so delicious. I had Ben as my server he was awesome and my 2 year old kept taking my bib and he continued to Bring me one as well as tie it as my hands were full. My drink was never empty and he cleaned off my table all threw my meal and i totally appreciate that. The staff was very helpful, kind and very attentive. I will be back thanks for an amazing meal.

I wanted to really like this place. # 1 you basically pay  to walk your child threw a maybe 15 min of dinosaurs supposed to be life size they do move and make noise that was the only cool Part.  For the most part the kids the children are so scared. After that they immediately have a gift shop then out you come to like 5 or so jumpers. They had a few activities face painting gem/rock finding and mining for gems that you had to pay an additional fee for tickets.  So not only are the adult prices $20 the kids are 2-12 $25 then another $20 for 12 tickets and for the majority all the things that take tickets are 4 tickets.  With that said you could pay over a 100 bucks for an average family of 4 for an a hour or 2 hours is a long haul. Not worth it.
