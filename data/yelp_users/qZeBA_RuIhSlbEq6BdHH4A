As they make the change to the new business model, the customer service is getting worse. The wait time times are longer, the staff,  less pleasant, the mistakes, more frequent.   No longer are you greeted with a smile and a hello but with dissatisfied glance and then they turn their back to you.   I won't be coming back.

Fantastic service. When our regular guy failed to return my two calls, I called JDT. The young woman who answered the phone was courteous and laughed at my jokes.  Jeff, the tech, was at my house less than 90 minutes later and the job was done in less than an hour. He was polite, knowledgeable and friendly.   Call JDT for your garage door repairs...you won't be sorry.
