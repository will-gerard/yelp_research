Yum: perfect homemade beans, ranchero breakfasts, tacos, tortillas, chicken mole, and menudo. Homemade chips and original spicy salsa. Folks, there is SO much to love at this consistent, satisfying restaurant. I've been known to do take out for evening cravings...Service is friendly and professional.

I've used Enterprise and this location for years; it is always a pleasure to see the molding of young professionals at this business. It starts with the professional dress then very patient manners. This fall, I arranged for a rental that coincided with multiple local sport events, which increased the demand for rental cars. The morning of the pick up, this office had only one car in its lot but had been promised approx 50+ vehicles, the prior evening by another location. Aside from lack of sweat, the service professional never wavered from the effort to get us into a car.  We thought a few minutes in the parking lot on the one option (a truck) and another option with better mileage rolled in out of their car wash.  He promptly agreed to rent us this luxury vehicle without added costs. It is refreshing that Enterprise provides the young employees the broad authority to meet the customers needs. Thank you!

Local business caters to corporate cafeterias; unfortunately training is lacking and food prep is eek! Food has improper storage and easy attraction for varmints. Repetitive menus focus on carbs and starch, not flavor.  A soggy precooked breakfast burrito is hard to swallow in our awesome foodie city.   Disappointing Turnover with grill chefs. There does not appear to be loyal followers here...

Visited them today to spruce up the Tacoma. Filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant, nice guy. Truck went through the wash. While in the drying line the guy that was supposed to be drying my truck spent more time flirting with his co-worker. He barely ran the rag around door jams. When they flagged me down, I walked around the truck. I asked if they were going to actually dry it  or was that extra?  Had to get them to finish washing the spots off. The windshield is still dirty. Had to remind them to put the antenna back on.   Could understand if they were busy,  but it was slow  This place is a joke. Wonder if the owners have any quality control in mind.

New location needs better ventilation. Awkward layout reeks of musty clothes.  Odor persists into breezeway.   Organization not clear. I sincerely hope this is a temporary location.

Beau & I enjoyed dinner at the bar this past weekend and, remarkably, missed the crowd, that arrived approximately 15 minutes later. It's taking me months to allow this restaurant it's own flavor compared to its previous life as Houston's, also at a nearby former location. Dining at the bar does elevate the fun for people watching!  Service is excellent. Salads (Caesar with roasted chicken, Thai noodle steak salad) truly hit the spot. Roasted artichoke appetizer caught other patrons' eyes; perhaps it was our total unabashed enjoyment of the tasty, fun finger food.   Wine list appeared short - should we have asked for a complete list to find broader Red selection in $30-$50 price points?   We appreciate the consistency of Hillstone and their ability to make the evening meal a memorable event.

Last week, we caught bar stools & dinner on a hopping evening at Hillstone. With the holidays approaching, make sure to make reservations here unless you are patient for standing room only!  The sushi is quite cold, tastes super fresh and is memorable. The caeser salad was a bit underwhelming; if you order with rotisserie chicken added, there is an up charge, as well as an assumption that the homemade croutons are not desired.  The great service brings me the side of croutons, with a minor wait. However, it really appeared that there had been portion cost analysis on this entree. Suffice to say, I tried the tuna poke to fill up a bit more.  Beau had the Thai noodle steak salad and it remains a favorite.  So, Hillstone is certainly a favorite but it does not come cheap. It is also the best bar for people watching.

We enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and service last evening at T Cooks.  Service was very good with a down to earth waiter, accompanied by professional support staff.  We appreciated the 'fire sale' on numerous bottles of wine that gave us more value for our wine choice.   As an appetizer, the large piece of calamari was original and perfectly done.  The calamari, with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, is alone worth a repeat visit !   The squash soup perhaps needed a bit of butter... or perhaps more flavor?  Crab cake appetizer was (of course) gorgeous crab meat but it also needed a bit more flavor - it is rare that I ever reach for salt but I am not sure that this was the one item missing.  The fennel was a nice pairing with the crab cake but the sauce did not have any notable role.   House chocolates a delight.  Then an easy progression to the lounge. The lounge was enjoyable for an after dinner drink and provides an ambiance  not widely available in Phoenix.  Service is impeccable and the servers are dressed as professionals.  Comfortable seating and live music provided a nice jive to T Cook's.  Thank you for the relaxing experience!

Beau and I Indulged a Friday evening here with a nicely paced meal of cod and duck/ pork belly. The latter was the chef's special and the tasty dish had nice presentation and a generous serving of duck. My order of the cod was ok; the white asparagus was too a la dente for my liking but the fish was cooked perfectly. We enjoyed a moderately priced bottle of red.  Service was excellent.   THEN we went to the lounge and swung to 3 sets of sassy jazz with Renee Patrick. Lounge is always great people watching and folks may have mused as we slowly, totally unwound to the music and jive.   Thank you T Cooks for a musical evening, that is a routine offering with their weekend dining. Thank you Ms Patrick for the enormous set of lungs.

Kudos to LGO for the neighborhood dynamics. I am pretty loyal to this grocery due to their consistent quality, except... What is changing with the English Muffins? The Commuter Sandwich isn't that awesome flavor without the heavy cornmealed, slightly oily English Muffin. The one this morn tasted more like a roll than a muffin and is unfortunately the 2nd in the last few months that has been below their usual quality. Meh.

Such a happening place with so little service.  Lots of neighborhood restaurants pour your bottle of wine for the table and refresh glasses. Similar establishments, with great ambience, also ask if you would would like another bottle. This Postino's service does not and their bottles aren't cheap.   Granted, plenty of servers milling around.  Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.  I guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?  There were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey! It's 60 degrees, brr.)  Butcher block is always a highlight and I won't give up on this fun place just yet. It simply needs some good floor management.

Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant, or discovered it on my own.  Folks have always been helpful & informative.  I will agree that they are pricey but big box stores cannot compare to the inventory at Bakers. Moreover, I'm do not agree with Yelp colleagues' low reviews. Unfortunately, gardening is 'at risk'. You figure out what your soil & attention span will foster and you are successful with those plants. Indeed, gardening comes with a learning curve that comes with failures & successes.  Their niche in the neighborhood will be a chasm after December.

First admission: we ate a LOT of sushi, sitting comfortably at the modest sushi bar with attentive, over competent chefs.  THEN a waiter with hair to his shoulders (not tied back) ducks behind the sushi bar to get a dish. The 2nd & 3rd times, the waiter, with the unkempt hair - behind the sushi area, essentially ended our meal. Tucking his hair behind his ears then grabbing for a plate. Gross and unacceptable.

We found ourselves at this corner, craving for a quick eat. We ducked in and were impressed by the sushi chef's quick service to sushi bar patrons and the hair hygiene of all waiters & sushi chefs. The one exception was the bartender.   The yellow tail & tuna hand rolls were loaded and very tasty; we'll return!

Great family restaurant which works for a reasonable dinner or a special celebration. Wine list offers nice selection; not all restaurants offer a free upgrade on the wine if they are out of your choice but Rosario's graciously did, immediately.  Food was good - pasta dinners were under $9. It was appreciated that the chef would add gorgonzola to the fettucini Alfredo - mmm. Server is a diamond in the rough; a few shadow opportunities of exquisite waiters and she would have it down pat. Either way, my beau and I  look for opportunities to return.  The restaurant was a bit warm, as well as the wine.

Toscano's may be taking advantage of the apparent captive audience at Pebble Creek. My good friend & I enjoyed their patio over lunch but food was mediocre. Grilled beef, chicken & shrimp were nicely prepared but salad greens looked like supermarket to go, iceberg lettuce, salads. Yes, we do know our beefsteak tomatoes and they were not included in the salad as advertised. In truth, my girlfriend enjoyed the chicken cheese crisp and the ice coffee was quite good. Service was just above being ignored.

Did you get locked out of your car without your phone? Sounds like a tough day until you go back into Safeway and they brainstorm the options with you. Local lock smith is called & you are on your way in 20 minutes. Nice small town friendly service - thank you!

Daisies on our table were already wilted when we sat down for dinner at 5:30 and may have been ominous of the inattention to detail that may have evolved here.  Waiter apparently cannot recite any of the beer selection and  tells my older friend to look on the drink menu for options. Aside from the disrespect, it is truly hard to read the menu in the eve ambience lighting here.  Bruschetta is poor and bread isn't toasted. When did their great bread selections drop off? Not one of my friends impressed by their spongy bread. Salad was good. Cheese platter is a bit sparse for $14.  Thus the service was poor, food below average and interior gorgeous, except for overflowing toilet.

What a nice easy stop en route home on the rail.  Service started out strong but slowly dropped off. The waiter, helping out the bar, forgot our extra bread order in a minute. Bar is gorgeous with a neighborhood feel; but a close look at the logistics show a work area stacked with bottles and no glassware washer. These girls behind the bar are stressed. My eagle eye beau was certain that the pours varied wildly...c'est la vie for a reasonable glass. Nice of the local distributor rep to yell (no, not yelp) out the true price of their wine selection. Rail ride home appears to be the trend in wrapping this bar.

Mel rose St Fair was jammin' and gave us the opportunity to duck into Los Compadres for eats. Previous reviewers helped me out and I went straight for the cheese crisp with chili strips. Their kitchen was great and delivered the crisp light on cheese, as ordered. My beau tried the remaining of the menu; taco, tamale, and green chili enchilada. His dishes were OK.  Tamales don't compete with local fare.  Beans are definitely good. Restaurant is clean. Just not spicy enough for us.

Great location for comfort food for wearied folks from the hospital. Cheese crisp was incredible and beans were also quite good.  Grill chef provided chopped fresh jalapeño upon request.  There are a few tweaks that would make this a regular stop for me: fix ice machine for soda fountain and liven up salsa bar.  Restaurant and restrooms were very clean.

Extremely disappointed with service; warmed bread finally brought to the table & olive oil provided about ten minutes later, after bread has cooled. Food brought 90 MINUTES after arriving for reservation.  One eggplant order dry, after apparently toasting under heat lamps. Salad dressing never provided.   Pizza very good.   Dolci "special"dessert is burned but served anyway!   Definitely the type of restaurant that you hurry to pay the bill just to end the agony...  Bathroom is filthy.  Believe the reviews on service & don't risk a special event here.

Beau and I celebrated Thursday eve with dinner at Kyoto.  Warning: Kyoto is getting packed, possibly due to tourist season.  However, we waited only a few five minutes for a seat on the sushi bar.   Their fresh sushi never disappoints.  The squid salad was awesome with a nice heat bite.  We wolfed down a caterpillar and rainbow roll with delight.  The sushi chef made us his special roll, filled with vegetables and a mild white fish, scallions, and slices of jalapeno on top.  It was a palate cleanser at the end of the evening.   One small comment on the bar: the bartender had to be interrupted from texting to replace a glass of wine. Guess the original pour was from day old wine. After he concurred to open a new bottle, he returned to texting, prior to replacing the wine. The disinterest to work(or intensity of his texting habit) was actually comical.   Truthfully, we love our Kyoto and this is our preferred sushi restaurant, when the craving hits.

Part of the initial thrill was beating the rush. However, the waiter's control and pace of service let us savor the balmy November day, and the Mexican eats, on their fun patio. Salsa is unique and has great kick, served with homemade chips. Flautas and tacos were packed with shredded beef and served with perfect beans. Although customers were pouring in for lunch, the waiter never rushed us. WOW.    Margarita menu was reasonable and tempting! Next time....soon.

Tourist trap in downtown Scottsdale.  Beau and I were in for an awesome pizza experience.  What we actually got was:   1. An antipasto that competed only with Costco tasters.  Haven't seen an antipasto so sparse  - with a few red peppers from the jar - in the Phoenix area.   2. A server so lazy that apparently didn't wish to  recall the beers available - hey, just read the menu.    3. Calzone was full of ricotta and cheese.  Nope, no flavor.   4. Garlic pizza was okay.

A very important indicator of Mexican food is the beans. Unfortunately, Teepee served up overbroiled, dry beans. A 2nd indicator is the Margaritas. A drink with Patron should have a bit of kick; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck. Caution: very noisy.  Service was excellent. However, there isn't much reason to return given neighborhood competition.

Just two simple NY style slices - $3.  Frankie makes some amazingly fresh, thin crust pizza with a perfect crispness and light on the cheese. This a neighborhood gem where you can also get a reasonable meal but 2 slices filled me up perfect.

Intimate setting that compliments an excellent brunch. Specialty juices & drinks were tempting.  Guacamole & chips were excellent with a nice presentation and flavorful salsa options.  Enchiladas with mole were fantastic. Beau enjoyed enchiladas with green chili sauce.  All eats taste extremely fresh. Portions realistic. Service was very crisp and polite.  Although lighting is dark, surfaces appeared very clean and sparkling.

Ticoz made an impression several years ago and this evening was not an exception.  The menu has stayed true with spicy twists on typical favorites. Ticoz has a generous happy hour and the sangria, mojitos, and margaritas are yummy. Unlike some restaurants, Ticoz provides happy hour prices in their dining room - not just their bar.   Aside from the great drinks, the crunchy home made chips and spicy salsa are worth several return visits. Tamales and chimichangas were favorites. Ample meat in all dishes; light eaters also have options.  Service is very friendly and prompt.

Start with the good; George of the Vig Rig will take you home for free (tip) if you are within range. Menu is fun. As I hadn't been here for a while   ( a year?!), the menu was refreshing plus daring. Speaking of risk, I ordered a Vigaz burger with sweet potato fries. Hamburger was prepared to order yet bun could use improvement. Would locally baked rolls hold up better? Fries were perfect with a tasty peppery Russian dressing.  So eats are decent.  However the bartenders could SMILE. Ok, I'm old  school plus bartended thru college.  We smiled and made small talk with  folks who were not gabbing in groups. Point: when I  saw a to go order, I  wished this had been my choice. Kinda unusual that the friendliest guy is  the valet ( who you pay $4 with tip.) Please work on the PR.

The food is terrible here. The only good part of our visit was the waitress. Left her a nice tip. When the restaurant ran the charge thru my bank they rounded up and claimed it was an error because my writing was hard to read.  I'll admit the up charge was only .72 cents but It's my money not yours,  the manager didn't seem to get that.  After a week manager finally called back but you could tell she was bothered by the whole issue.  2 stars for the waitress.

Fuego Bistro IS a 5 star IF I could figure how to "roll" over the stars with my Iphone. Here's why: 1. Patio is gorgeous with great live music.  2. Dinners are flavorful, especially the roasted pork, creamed corn, and mashed potatoes. Mmm. 3. Best drinks in town AND they don't overcharge for good liquor.  4. Love the service. 5. VIP card is additional value, if they still offer.  Menus are cool too. Yes! They do take reservations!

I truly thought this would be a follow up review. Then I discovered that I never had reviewed one of my favorite neighborhood eats!  Tarbell's is the perfect restaurant for a special location, or if you simply want a bit of joy in your evening.  Menu is varied with appetizer/ side dishes satisfying for a main course also. The carpaccio is the best in the valley, with an original presentation. The waiters allow you to savor a bottle of wine with small pours & frequent attention to the table.   Last night we tried a bacon candy salad. The bacon and radicchio didn't initially appear to match but Beau and I devoured it. Watching the service was impressive as they hustled with completing orders, interacting with the customers or cleaning every component of their area. ( Never will you see a waiter/ bartender checking a phone or texting away. )  Thus, fantastic flavorful dishes. Acoustics pair the happening hum behind the needed intimacy for a conversation. Service is friendly & professional.

We jumped off the lite rail then wore out leather deciding on an eatery. So many great choices downtown & Kincaid's does not disappoint. Staff easily agreed to set us up on the patio and brought out the fine linen tablecloth before our $17 burger arrived. Presentation and taste well worth the splurge; loved the jalapeno stuffed olives and Caesar side salad. Service easily outshown Donovan's and Kincaid's appears to have more pride than to serve an iceberg wedge with not one garnish! You will not confuse this steakhouse with it's competitors.

Kincaid's is still very cool but disappointing.  Lunch service was slow even without a crowd. Waiter forgot my beer 3 times. My mom thought it could be CRS syndrome.  Tuna and burger sandwiches are quite tasty AND messy; it would be a good test to see the chef eat them with ease.

Today I cancelled a service. The gentleman asks for the account code even though their recorded service requires you to enter it with your phone key pad, prior to connecting to customer service. In addition, SWGas uses a social security number to confirm account identity - outdated and contributes to identity theft.  The keyboard by the representative was extremely LOUD and sounded like a an ice machine. He indicated it was a new keyboard ...extremely unpleasant to listen to.  One last comparison to SRP - whose customer reps were available at 7 am; SWGas is not available via phone until 8 am.

Our Happy Hour Friday started here and we did not have to look any further.  Architecture wows you and we were continuously pouring over the building details of this custom eatery. (Apparently the chef and the architect toured 30+ restaurants in San Francisco to determine desired elements for St Francis.)   Ah yes, the food!  Great happy hour prices with a $10 carafe of grenache and free bruschetta, roasted red onions on foccacia, olives, and nuts. When have you seen free appetizers during a happy hour? I just haven't and these eats were awesome. The quality of the appetizers held us over until dinner service at 5 pm. Our server was really watching out for us and took our order as soon as the kitchen started rockin'.   I enjoyed a salmon & salad with with a Nicoise touch and Beau coveted a pork chili with corn bread.  Nice fresh vegetables with the salad and perfect house dressing.  That's just the starters on this menu!  We were full but are quite excited to return.   Service was impeccable. Thanks Angie!!

Yummy food and excellent service, as always. However Beau and I have been scrupulous when evaluating restaurants' hygiene; it was unsettling to see them sweep the floor with raw food, clean plates and prep bowls so very low to the floor. Most servers had their hair pulled back tightly, or very short, with one exception - and her long loose hair stood out. It was disappointing that they charged extra for a broccoli substitute for pasta.

A packed lunch hour shows off the kitchen rocking.  A few minor tweaks indicate management is aware of the kitchen's organization, as well as food protection.  Awesome romaine salad, prosciutto and, fig flatbread, and roasted vegetables. Nice wine pours.   Really comfortable, stimulating digs to unwind the week.   Thank you for the consistent reprieve!

The Gaslight Square is on fire and this is another bright option to this strip mall. Why am I so hooked to The Market? They didn't copycat any typical new restaurants. All of their interiors are fastidious and tasteful (not just thrown up yesterday) and they definitely have the cafe vibe. I'm excited about the cheeseboard and charcuterie options plus happy hour. Baked goods are very yummy and quiche was gorgeous.    Staff were extremely professional - even making sure that tidying up (sweeping) wasn't a bother to me.  Thanks for the great option in our neighborhood! Looking forward to kicking back on your patio this spring.   Folks, they also have ample parking... A commodity in Arcadia.

I have only love for this awesome sandwich, salad, and sweet shop. Bertha stays true to her own menu with a breakfast burrito with roasted tomatoes and sweet carmalized onions. The veggie sandwiches were a huge hit with coworkers... If I can only stay away from the awesome chocolate cookies with white chocolate.

The Chicago Gyro is served with the wallop of awesome dressing. Even though a big eater, I stretched this gyro and fries for 2 lunches. Their service is crisp and get you the food, provide a to go box - if necessary - and give their thanks. Love it.   Looking forward to trying their Middle Eastern eats. Note: pay the buck extra and get the gyro with the salad. Fresh greens and nice size salad.

Broke out of the hood to go to Ranch House Grill. Wow, down home service,  comfortable patio - with a view, and awesome Eats. Breakfast burritos really hit the mark. Good beans, as a side option. Coffee kicks.  One small note by the Beau: gravy for the biscuits was a bit salty.  Overall, great option for breakfast with good value and satisfying food. Go with an appetite!

The good news? The $60 wine was awesome. The bad news? Happy hour prices were just ten feet away at the bar. For the unfortunate diner, not seated at the bar, the wine list could definitely use more reasonable price points for glasses and bottles.  While folks crave true value for the indulgent meals, Eddie's is serving up over salted scallops and greens plus $36 untrimmed rib eyes.  Cute paper menus are stained from previous diners. No bread or extras served at those prices but they will allow the bread plates to hang on the small table all night.  Folks would be more rewarded dining at the stiff competition in this neighborhood.

Lunch stop here blew my budget and was a disappointment. Certainly I don't mind paying for good sushi but standard rainbow roll had very little fish and no personality. Hand roll of salmon skin had unrecognizable crumbs of fried something. Even ginger condiment was a small pile of half shavings. Edamame was not fresh. Prices inappropriate for quality & ambience; too many wooden fence panels indoors for me.  Restaurant was clean. Server provided entrees while talking on the phone.

BLT recently had a write up as one of the top steak houses in the Valley.  Hmm... thus, we ventured over to the Camelback Inn to try this steak house, which apparently has been open for over a year.   The wine list is not for a light wallet as we flipped thru the pages to find a reasonable wine below $50.  Finally, we made our choice.  The waitress returned with sad news: not in stock.  (Why they just didn't run down to Safeway to pick up the bottle of  Layer Cake, was a thought that hit me later. )  Poor service and poor taste by the staff not to offer a similar wine at the same price.  Alas, we picked a higher priced bottle.   Next, we meandered to a cheese tray.  A fourth menu for the cheese selection now crowded the table, with the wine list, original menu plus the Chef's Blackboard specials.  There was the option to pick 5 out of 7 cheeses and the cheese cart was dramatically wheeled over in about ten minutes of wonder.  Soo, we have the selection of 5 but they are out of 2 cheeses... wow, lack of options were not impressing us.   Thus, our last decision was to skip dinner and head to the Sanctuary.  The cozy retreat where the service was definitely geared to the customer.

Such a perfect location in downtown Phoenix. Happy hour dishes, drinks and plenty of seating rewards early birds. Well versed server provides all the specials and allows a slow, relaxed evening. Filet with gnocchi was excellent and Beau enjoyed the rib eye special . Scallop appetizer combines  a lot of fun flavors with the deep fried scallop; We also enjoyed their lobster mac & cheese.  The atmosphere is fun and relaxing; it also is unique. Noticed one reviewer mentioned no high chairs for youngins. Thank you for keeping it sophisticated.

Folks, grab a seat here this summer as the tourist masses have left.  I can do a reverse review and indicate what I don't like. Tuck Shop has me addicted to chicken & cheese waffles and their desserts are so good that you will try two. Scallop ceviche was full of flavors, including mango. Service is on par with their excellent food quality; I appreciated the labeling of the leftover containers.

Steakhouses are competitive today and the typical Yelper probably has his or her favorite.  My good friend and I were eager to see the type of energy that the new investors have injected into a local legend, the Wigwam in Litchfield Park.   As time was flying by, in the last 10 years, the AZ Kitchen (also in the Wigwam Resort) closed for dinner.  This southwestern gem was also affectionately called the 'Snake Pit' by a friend but the service was top notch and it was one of the earlier restaurants that provided full view of the kitchen by diners.  The Wigwam's ballroom dining has now been converted to Red's Steakhouse.   Service started out well with a nice touch of a choice of fruit for your water.  The waiter had recommendations but also allowed us time to ponder the menu.  We opted for the couple's dinner, essentially a prix fixe with a salad, choice of sea bass or steak, and the shared dessert.  We also decided to try the crab cake appetizer - just to adventure through the menu a bit; this resulted in a stern warning from the waiter that the steaks were 14 ounces.   The crab cake was a nice presentation with fresh crab and a toasted crunchy top and colorful spinach bottom.   The side avocado dressing was a bit heavy for the crab and appeared similar to the faux guacamole at cheaper eateries.  However the crab was dry and the waiter brought more of this dressing out for us.   The service with the Caesar salad presentation began to falter. The salad is the craze of serving entire stalks of the romaine and a toasted slice of bread.  Reminding the waiter for salt and pepper, he promptly provided a set and advised us the salt was also in a grinder. My friend determined that the pepper grinder was broken and did not provide a coarse grind and the waiter asked if we would like another pepper grinder.  Actually, for the prix fixe price of $45, I really wanted the waiter to politely grind the salt and pepper over our salads.  The crouton had no flavor.   Our steaks were done as ordered but the NY Strip did not have a lot of flavor. The menu indicates the meat is grilled at 1600 degrees. However, my medium rare steak really appeared to be grilled on my a standard grill with no caramelizing or searing to hold in the rare juices. The steaks were true to size of waiter's tip.   The steaks were served with two asparagus stalks which appeared to be white asparagus with green tips, a unique veggie for the plate.  An au gratin potato patty also accompanied the steak and was quite yummy.   As the server boxed up our plates, they brought out a raspberry mouse.  Its flavor did not impress either of us but my girlfriend did find the mascarpone center and it was addictive.   Service was not astute nor attentive and sometimes baffling.  We were just into the meal when the waiter dramatically closed the drapes of the window near us. One of the other diner's called out in sadness to lose the evening sun but the waiter shushed her and said they would be opened intermittently to avoid blinding other diners. Could Red's should consider awnings or subtle window shades to preserve our dining views?   The Wigwam may not be hoppin' just yet; but  as we left the restaurant, the three restaurants on Old Litchfield Road - outside the gates of the resort - were busy as locals may have enjoyed more reasonable fare and better service.  These restaurants are our next adventure!

Check in with the guard and he gives you the option of valet or park your own car. This is a courteous option but valet is the way to go if you have a date.  If you park yourself, it's an interesting adventure with the utility view of the Phoenician, along with leaking couplers, in the Phoenician basement.  It is also a easy misstep to get on the elevator, read the directions on how to get to the Steakhouse, then still do a misstep at the lobby floor. Yes, the directions are to get off the A/B elevators and change to the C/ D elevators.  The look about in the lobby is a TBT with a bit of 70's decor and several furniture pieces, along with the fountain, dating the hotel.  Jump on those elevators and the entrance to the steakhouse is impressive. The first impression is that it's a destination for drinks, and that is also my last impression.  Grab the Jinga matchsticks and the hostess seats you. We have an early dinner time thus we politely haggle for a table a bit closer to the view. Hey, the place is empty!   Table appears nicely set and the paper placemats appear organic. Wait until the end of the meal when the busboy crumbles the placemat like Denny's and dumps crumbs on the table.  Ah yes the food! Parker Rolls throw back to the hotel decor and actually are stale. The steak tartare is very good but ruined in presentation by serving in a bowl. It is suggested that a flat plate be used and flavorful dressing provided on the side or thickened up a bit and living up the plating. Steaks were underwhelming, especially compared to the competion in this town, and the smaller NY Strip was actually half the thickness of the larger order.  The smaller steak  was overdone for medium rare. Aside from salads, we cheap out with no sides for the meat entree. This option of ordering a la carte for the main dish feels like a stare down between the restaurant and your wallet (Hard to believe that veggies cannot be thrown in with the pricey steak.)  Service was stellar. Wine options reasonable and savagnon blanc chosen was yummy.  Left a comment card with email & phone but it still must be in a paper pile....

Good friend and I swung into cute cafe, which was totally unfamiliar to me. Initial reaction is that their marketing did a great job. The second reaction is that the kitchen needs to stretch a bit. Reuben is average size but deserves a rye bread, not sweet raisin rye. Thousand island dressing was appreciated. My friend ordered two scrambled eggs; they were served dry and cold. Toast unremarkable.  I did grab the nicely prepackaged sweet crisps for home munching. Pretty expensive indulgence.

Don't miss the 1/2 price appetizers thru today, 3.22. Guacamole and salsa has a refreshing kick. Guacamole definitely surpasses quality of typical fare at local restaurants. Fish tacos (2) are a deal and tasty. Tortillas melt in your mouth. Service attentive but bar slowing the pace. Nice upscale feel without being stuffy. What a great addition to the neighborhood!

Luci's is a comfort food stop with a huge dose of healthy. Yesterday I had a turkey wrap; it had a healthy serving of romaine with the substantial turkey and bacon. The dressing was awesome in this wrap too - I'm guessing it was a homemade Green Goddess.   Service is always friendly. (Amazingly, the server responded immediately when they served it as a sandwich. No blame game but let us redo as a wrap for you!)  I've also tried the burgers & fries here. The dish makes me want to redo/ copy the 5 Guys DAMN YouTube. DAMN.  A detour to this corner requires planning and patience to park, and perhaps walk a bit. However, those two steps lead to a nice reward.

Good news is that there is awesome competition in this neighborhood for tavern food & brews. Bad news is that this is one of two that we can walk to & become regulars. But it's horrid!  Here are our thoughts:  1. Don't serve food that you cannot perfect. Seared tuna should not be served brown and cold. 2. Try good service and service with a smile. The manager and random walking employees frown and/or are not upbeat with service. 3. Prices are too high for an apparent start up.  4. Great options for game viewing with lots of TVs. 5. Good sound quality & not deafening volume from the games. 6. Nachos looked good.

Checking out the other reviewers makes me think I am missing something. Twice, I've tried the salmon salad and am not keen about it. Is it simply smoked salad with ranch dressing? Really am interested in 2 cups of additional greens for the $. This salad certainly does not compete with a Wildflower or Paradise Bakery effort.  However, I will try a different dish next time...

Tommy V's had been a consistent 'go to' for a Thurs or Fri night eats.  Loved their pizza, wine and service.  However, last week, there was a rude awakening.  The 'three mushroom' pizza arrived with one mushroom and lots of green onions.  I stared at it and had a slice.  Then, I finally had to ask.... Kudos (seriously, they complimented me!) from the chef and waiter that I actually recognized that they had run out of the 2 other mushrooms.  To top the experience, they were going to charge us for the pizza.  Bummer.

Not a fan of Big Box stores but Total Wine provided awesome service that earned my future business! Prompt greetings when you walk in the door, directed to a broad assortment of champagnes, and even opened a bottle for a taste - upon request. Moreover, they loaded all my choices into the cart. I was also pleased with the price points of their selection.  Thanks again for the great service.

Quiet eve at The Grind but service was stellar. I could complain that the wine was way too cold or that the asparagus was overdone. However, that's not the point folks; the burgers are awesome. Thanks for the great Peppercorn and the Buffalo Burgers.

Reasonable unique tapas restaurant. I would be interested in their recommended wine pairings (next) but was distracted by the kitchen noise at our table - in the same room as the oven. It was disconcerting to note a salad languishing for its partners' plate on the counter.  Last minute substitution for seafood in salad.  Salad very good. Gnocchi dish too heavy for Italian preferences. Extra star for downtown and service. (Bring change for parking.)

Fun diner with a unique offering of Pancake Rolls. Broad menu with an area that allows tv football viewing and alcohol.  Clear family area with diner vibe. Patio comfortable but employee smoke breaks do impact diners. Everything is very clean!   Definitely a value and will try again.

Eek! Meat (burgers) lacked flavor. Nice romaine lettuce but green chilies canned.  Marble rye bread option appreciated. "Roasted garlic" appeared to be browned on grill, and not roasted as advertised.  Beau felt that burger was a lot of mess with no flavor.  Homemade potato chips too greasy to eat. Steak fries pretty good but the color questioned if the fry grease needed to be changed.  Too many nearby restaurants that compete with price point for lunch. Admittedly, the decor - for me - is a turnoff also. All the paraphernalia are dust magnets.  Service friendly.

ShinBay is a very fun and adventurous sushi experience. The chef's tasting menu was diverse and satisfying: the halibut appetizer and clam/mushroom entree were standouts.  The relaxing atmosphere enhances a special occassion.    The service could be crisper.

OHSO has hit a neighborhood niche; wow, decent beer AND food for a 30+ gen salary. There are kinks as they hit the ground running but the charm has started. Yep, they do need a a hostess and the smoker's lounge cannot be at the front door. There is also a poor French fry maker (so soggy!) and the unique, pricey cheese plates should be consistent.  It would be also awesome if they avoid the Scottsdale rock charge and charge for a decent pour.   Welcome to Arcadia!

The patio is a rocking with beer and dog lovers as OHSO has clearly ingrained themselves in the neighborhood.  Warning: you will envision yourself as a dog owner. Aside from the libations, are the well behaved canines lifting our spirits?  For the re-review, food quality is consistently good. Try the tacos or hearty cheese board.  Eats are reasonably priced too.   I also enjoyed an excellent tequila cocktail: the Jensen. That refreshing drink with a jalepeno bite will be enjoyed again this summer. A tiny slip up is the bar did made a gimlet with sour mix; a minor faux pas as we should all go there for the BEER!   This fun bike destination does get crowded; enjoy midweek to get over the hump!

We will try again in the future but essentially "only" set back $60 for a pitcher of margaritas and a round of drinks for two. Of course we ordered eats but food never arrived!   A bit surprised there was not a tequila menu; although we luckily didn't drown our sorrows, nor our wallets, waiting on the food. Unfortunately just wasted our time...waiting and waiting.

The complimentary, efficient valet and steak salad are the stars of this new steak house.  The service is the distraction; hostess was insistent that we provide our name for the list although we are clear that our eats will be in the bar.  (they actaully do no follow up with us although we are now on the list - huh?!?)  The bar maintained the same layout as Houston's had. However the handful of bartenders never connect and they begin the intimate relationship with a request for a credit card for the tab.   Lots of activity behind the bar with napkin folding, glass washing and comraderie (9 to 10 pm) and we flag them down for water, again for eats, for a bill, then to pay the bill - even with debit cards clearly lined up with bill in glass on bar.   A waitress apologizes for a delay with the steak salad and offers a complimentary dessert. We never see the generous gal again nor was the offer apparently passed onto our flock of inattentive servers.   One of the best steak salads in the 'hood with a perfectly grilled steak and lightly dressed lemon horseradish dressing. Our valet responds to a text to grab the car. With a smile from the young man, we escape the rudeness of Del Frisco's into the Arizona night.

Understated decor matches simple flavorful dishes. Great service and new bar area could prove popular. Not for hearty eaters but still proves satisfying.  All dishes were inspiring: home made mozzarella, raw fish, and gnocchi. Every dish offered new insights into refreshing favors.  Quite glad they are in the Arcadia hood.

What a seat to watch the over 45 crowd head to the Van Halen concert! Yep, that's our generation doing shots of tequila with Coors Lite chasers.   The conversational slur:  What type of tequila you got? (we're quite picky) Aw, never mind that's good (too drunk to care)   So wow it was crowded with some drunks, cool folks and young'uns.  Bartenders maintained their cool with the escalating demands... Then normalcy returned with a pleasant jibe that allowed us to absorb this fun space within the Palomar.  Menu was reasonable but bar had the most options with unusual whiskeys, oversized rocks, and signature drinks without too much sugar. Ceviche enjoyable with well brined scallops, shrimp, and chili threads.  Guess the one nagging detail was how the bar treated a young man, under dressed but paying cash...geez they requested drink payment right away then they almost double charged him for the drink when he paid up for the later  entree. Meanwhile, we hadn't even offered a credit card for our honest tab. Can't figure out that one.  Loved the oversized rocks with the whiskey and nice pours. We will be back!

Overpriced "special" for the 4th gave us a view of South Phoenix and the lonely abandoned hotel across the block. No option for views of fireworks to the north and east. Blue Hound closed for holiday, as well as the many excellent eateries downtown. Pool & DJ opened to the Public. We saw two servers in two hours at the pool top; never did anyone personally offer service. Front desk offering plenty of excuses & more drink credits but people needed food & service.  Don't waste your time here as other downtown hotels have far better views & service, with more reasonable rates. It is noted that local guide in room has the majority of listed restaurants in Scottsdale & Arcadia. Kimpton seems out of touch with downtown establishments.

Nice reuse for an existing commercial space; decor is unique and interesting. Floor DJ adds to vibe.   Small plates unique, flavorful, and satisfying; we tried beef tartare, squid, chicken legs, and shrimp plates. Not one dish disappointed. Our one regret is that we did not pace the ordering as the dishes came out all at once and stymied an effort for a relaxing slow meal. Our 2nd regret was eating the complimentary cheddar puffs. Although the puffs were very good, they were also filling and nipped our appetites. The beef tartare was a true highlight with flash fried seaweed, capers, taro chips, and a quail egg.   Service was very friendly, attentive, and down to earth.  Valets definitely need an improved cone and thoroughfare area; it was awkwardly staged and did not have an obvious traffic flow to compliment the restaurant.  Wine menu appeared to be limited to minimum red bottle prices of $50. Hope I overlooked the reasonably priced wines - no one wants to be a sucker!

Refreshing, down home servers who efficiently provide the specials, along with prices. Broad menu and you do catch yourself salivating and  staring at dinner eats passing by.  A mistake in a drink order is politely corrected within minutes.  Broad menu options - including short ribs - may remind you of your favorite restaurant, unless you've forgotten it already...Barrata salad, buffalo sirloin, and crab cake were all memorable. Drinks reasonable (thank you.)

Happy hour provides nice value with filling, satisfying small plates: pork tostadas are incredible and have no comparison with a few of our fav Mexican eateries.   We are keeping our fingers crossed not to get the waiter again who is skimping on hair ties.

Hopping Thursday Eve and plenty of attentive servers. High energy and greetings upon arrival distract us from the fun architectural details - to be absorbed on the way out.  High end front door parking, with fake grass and pavers, is very fun and should endure the western sun. Only bad news at initial greeting was that there was no happy hour. They graciously seat us when we realize tables are available in bar area. Again, great interior options in the bar - including automated shades - that intrigue patrons and inspire the design challenged home decorator.   Ok, drink & eats! Thanks for a broadly priced wine list. Caution on over pouring the patrons as the wine is to be savored. The appetizer oysters were fun but the blanket of pepper swayed us away from a seafood entree. Steaks were indeed perfect... The Delmonico a bit fatty.  Filet has a crisp burnt finish but beautifully rare interior and flavor. Butter generously used with veggie sides. Horseradish extremely fresh and enjoyed.  Truly felt pampered and Steak 44 is striving to be the creme of the Arcadia steak houses. (Enjoy the bar chandelier on the way out plus the wine & knife collection.)

Interior contemporary remodel with nostalgic Pizza Hit windows. This is what the neighborhood waited, waited, and waited for. Hmm.  Bring your charge card folks. Your favorite sushi bar may not easily not be toppled as pricey rolls, sashimi and drinks await you. Market price is 22% above your new payroll tax, pun intended.  Fish was fresh and lollipop roll was fun. Friendly service. Water carafe on the table for the self-refills available. Unusual wet rock glass for the saki is served.   Bathrooms need work. Employees may wish to leave towels outside when walking thru.

There are two type of surprises that we have experienced at Bink's. The first one is that the food combinations are a blast, and flavors of the dishes are fun. The second one is the bar environment. Its not fun to have to ask to order nor request silverware and clean plates. I would like insight on when a more professional bartender may be on shift. Or, next time, we'll opt for the dining room.

Ingo's is very fun with intriguing architectural details. We enjoyed the grass fed burgers and smooth, efficient service. The Happy Hour ($3 specials) alone are worth a revisit but the Eats are indeed tasty. Removed a star as the girls all had long hair behind the counter & not securely fastened. Added a star as this is one creative joint; they certainly are not taking the local customers for granted. Thanks LGO.

You can drop a hundred here & there at nearby steak houses, however Ingo's will satisfy you with fresh, perfectly done eats for a fraction of the cost. Beau enjoyed the fish sandwich and my guacamole veggie dish was the envy of the counter. What gorgeous veggie colors & presentation. Perfect ending to an early evening out.  Free salty, chocolate chip bites. This is a really nice touch.   Staff friendly & professional.

The Wine Store has a  focus of unusual or hard to find wines. This was confirmed by the pleasant staff but is also clear on the scrawled prices on the reused wine racks from former Sportsmen's. I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to Chef Mark Tarbell due to his commitment of reuse of the space, especially as a wine store. It would be a benefit (to me)if the wines & price points varied a bit in the  $20-30. I'm also looking forward to a bit more of a WOW interior to accompany the upscale prices.  Apparently the electrical contractor working in the building has left them with out heat for over 24 hours. This is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the contractor's skills. This also indicates patience on the staff.  Thanks Chef Tarbell for taking a risk and maintaining the history of this corner. Looking forward to the final vision.

We detoured from carbs and tried Grassroots on a Saturday afternoon; only our second visit since this convenient location has opened. Beau had the Ahi Salad and was pleased. I was on a mission to try another Caeser salad and Grassroots hit it perfectly; anchovies offered and plenty of homemade croutons. Drip coffee was perfect.

Wow, grab a bunch of veggies in their pressed juices to start your day.  Folks are very friendly; at 2nd visit, staff putting in ponytail while behind the counter. Just a bit more diligence with the hair hygiene may be appropriate.   I did enjoy the juices regardless & love this option in Arcadia.

The open face burratta, as well as the avocado smash, are indulgent options - even for foodies. Their menu provides basics and that's the point: crusty bread and fresh ingredients.  We are quite lucky to have the Noble Eatery in town & prices reasonable compared to the scrutiny and care that they do for their bread and veggie accompaniments.

Our First Friday fun had us sitting on the stools and have the two young men stuff us silly. Fried Catfish was a beauty of a dish with just a tossed layer of cornmeal and the pig ears were toasty hot with great flavor. Generous servings will allow us to munch thru the next day on the fare. Small efficient kitchen really spotlights the cooks/ chefs and the disciplined hygiene is evident. Casual friend (executive chef?) seems to throw off the rhythm - as well as the cleanliness with an apron on/ off, a cellphone & a long do. I'll lean into the relaxed feel but it was noticeable.

Babe and I enjoyed a mellow evening dinner during their soft opening. It is evident that the owners are doing a "throw down" to The Henry and Steak 44. Decor definitely encourages you to linger and fresh oyster options pull in memories of Grand Central's Oyster Bar. Staff was attentive but the multiple staff leaves no one accountable for a drink refill.  I enjoyed the very cold steak tartare with exception; the presentation could be improved. Babe had the halibut and it was nicely done for his taste. Drinks were reasonable but the two namesake cocktails left me with regrets the next morn.   We are eager to try the remaining menu and welcome LGO's competition to the corner! (However I will be staying away from the Rittenhouse rye.)
