My boyfriend and I eat at The Good Egg at least once a week!  They have a huge selection of breakfast items.  I like it that they state the calories of each item right on the menu!  They are always busy, but if there is a wait it is never very long and they a free coffee station outside on the weekends.  My boyfriend loves the Bacado omelet.  I have ordered many things there and have never gotten something I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  Their service is always friendly and quick and they offer a stamp card for repeat business.  When you get enough stamps you receive a free entree.  Overall it is one of my favorite breakfast places!

I love Ocean Club! We have eaten here many times as we live very close. The service is attentive and what should be expected from a fine dining restaurant. I swear I could just live off the pretzel bread and butter cake! They have an extensive wine list and their cocktails are also very generous portions. The lobster mashed potatoes are delicious and last time I was here I had the big eye tuna, which was cooked to perfection! Love love love this restaurant!

Absolutely wonderful. Very modern decor and friendly service. I have had the eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy and both of the breakfast burritos. You order at the counted, take your number and they bring you your food. Everything I have eaten here was delicious! Well flavored and a huge portions. The staff is also very nice! I also love their naturally flavored teas.

I took my fianc√© here for an early Valentines dinner. The service was for the most part fabulous, except for the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine and had to refill our glasses ourselves. The server was highly knowledgeable about the menu and answered any questions we had. Some of the food was fabulous, the fried deviled eggs, the short ribs and the pork osso bucco. The mac and cheese was unimpressive and in my opinion, the brussels sprouts were not cooked enough, but still had great flavor. Overall a great local gem and we will be back!

One of my favorite local breakfast places. Small, but wonderful food and service. My favorite breakfast item is Chicken On The Coop. It's like Thanksgiving and breakfast all in one dish, delicious! We live right across from this restaurant and go there once in a while, but the servers always remember us and make us feel very welcome! Its a must try with delicious original menu items. A Scottsdale hidden gem.

If I could give this restaurant no stars I would! We were so excited to dine in all the local concepts in terminal 4 in the Phoenix Airport.  My husband and I chose Cowboy Ciao which is one of our local favorites.   We were seated right away, but that's about the only positive of the entire dinner. I noticed they had a couple of all day breakfast options and even though it was dinner time, I was in the mood for breakfast.   When the server came over I specifically asked if these all day breakfast options were truly available all day and she said yes. So we quickly ordered because we were trying to catch our flight and I ordered breakfast.   Some time after we ordered my husband had a clear view of the kitchen line. He could see his Reuben sitting in the window. Finally our server came to inform us they ran out of biscuits to make my order.  They took so long to tell me this that I did not have time to order something else and have them prepare it before our flight.    They brought out my husband's Reuben and because it was sitting in the window for so long it was luke warm!   We tried to split it but it was really terrible. At this point the server came up and told us the manager had graciously offered to comp our ice teas for me not being able to eat. He never once asked how we liked the Rueben that was mostly untouched left on the plate.   We were unfortunately forced to pay for the Reuben and left hungry! Pathetic!! But the worst part was we stopped at McDonald's a couple doors down to grab something so we wouldn't starve on the plane and I made eye contact with the manager of Cowboy Ciao while we were standing in the McDonald's line.   So not only did we have to pay for something that was terrible, the manager saw that we were still hungry and still did nothing to try to fix the situation! Stay clear of this place it is definitely not like the Cowboy Ciao in Old Town!!

My husband and I have been trying to make it to Snooze for the last couple months after friends have raved about how delicious it is. We finally went this last Sunday and it didn't disappoint.   First let me say if you are looking for a quick in and out breakfast this is not your place. Expect to wait. They quoted us a 90 minute wait time. They get your cell phone number and text you when you table is ready. This works out great if you want to go next door and browse around at Nordstrom Rack. They texted us in just over an hour that our table was ready.   Service was great and the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Snooze spuds deluxe which was so delicious! We also ordered the pancake flight with a pineapple upside down pancake, a sweet potato pancake and a candied apple pancake. All were to die for!   This place is definitely worth the wait and I can't wait until the one in North Scottsdale is open in Kierland!

We went here for lunch and can't wait to come back and try the Ahi Poke on the dinner menu (I wish they have more appetizer choices on the lunch menu).  I tried the Pork Tacos, which came with rice and black beans.  The pork was very tender and flavorful with a hint of pineapple.  My fiance ordered the chicken bowl, which was delicious!  The curry based sauce they used on the chicken was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted.  The service was slightly slow, but the food was wonderful!
