I can't really add anything that hasn't been said...Just go there! The wait can be obnoxious but thats a good sign if you ask me.  I always get the same thing...1 thigh, 1 breast (for later), greens, grits and sometimes the mac n cheese. Oh and sweet tea!!   Just go...NOW

After spending almost 15 minutes driving around looking for this place I finally had to call because I was getting ready to just give up and head on over to one of my absolute faves in the area...Swaddee!! But I dialed up the phone and the girl on the other end helped guide me to this little gem tucked away just southwest of the parking lot in the Fry's shopping plaza.   This place is a small, family owned sandwich shop that offers a really diverse menu and 3 homemade soups daily at a very reasonable price. I had a hard time decided actually because I wanted to stick to the diet and order a salad but the sandwich list was just calling to me. I ended up going with half a Canadian French Dip and a small salad which they let you substitute for chips. I figured it might offset the calories in the sandwich.  Man was this sandwich GOOD! Lots of super thin sliced roast beef, spicy mayo and gooey cheese on a really fresh tasting roll. Its a good thing I went with half because I probably wouldn't have been able to restrain myself from eating a whole sandwich had I bought it.  After reading some of the other reviews on here, I do have to agree that the service is a bit, well....."cold". Now, I do NOT expect an overly zealous staff in my face asking me how my day is going...in fact, that annoys me. But this isn't a real friendly bunch and the girl behind the counter seemed a bit confused and the trio of dudes working the kitchen behind her weren't really motivated to help her out, they seemed rather annoyed they even had to be there. That being said, it wouldn't dissuade me from returning and I'm even considering using their catering menu when we order big lunches for the office but it did cost them a star.

I've shopped at WHBM for years now but I've always done it online. I can't say I'd ever stepped foot into an actual store. So you can imagine my hesitation when I read the one star bad reviews - especially coming from customers who've visited other locations and found them to be great.  Well, something must have changed since last year when the last review was posted because my experience was nothing short of excellent. I got service I would expect at a designer label storefront in NYC by Audra. She was so attentive without being pushy. I was looking for a summer suit separate to take on a business trip with me and I didn't have time to have it altered (which is common for me). I was initially trying on the new items at full price but when none of them fit my petite frame very well she mentioned something on the sale rack!! It ended up being absolutely perfect in fit and style - no altering necessary!!  The savings allowed me to buy more than I came for so I walked out with another jacket I can pair with jeans or with slacks for a more professional look, a dress and even some earrings.   Audra's helpfulness and attentiveness were first class. I noticed the other sales rep seemed just as attentive to her customers as well.   I have to wonder if the reviews and potential other complaints made it up to corporate forcing them to "clean house". WHBM is known to have very loyal clientele and this location is prime. I recommend another try if you haven't been in awhile!!

Look, you want authentic Sonoran style mexican food like Arizonan's are used to then Carolina's is the place.  Best tortillas in town. LOVE the machaca, tamales, even the 2 beef taco combo!  The place is constantly packed yet she can still afford to be closed on Sundays. Normally, that would be considered restaurant death but not for Carolina's. What better sign do you need?

Hands down one of the top restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area. Period. Consistently impressive and a great place to take guests or have that special occasion meal.

I shop at Sprout's on Cactus/Tatum and had always wondered about this new little place called Floyd's next door but never made the effort to venture in. Groupon offered a 50% off recently so I decided to give it a shot and I can't wait to go back.  Floyd's has a cozy, casual atmosphere and a diverse menu. I had the pot roast and it was super tender, rich in flavor plus a huge portion. I could only eat half and took the rest for home for lunch the next day. My daughter finally settled on the grilled cheese which isn't hard to screw up but neverless she was still very happy with her dish.  They had a happy hour menu on the table when I was there and it looks I may need to come back and try that out!

I have since been back to Floyd's Kitchen, this past weekend in fact for a solo lunch before I did my weekly shopping at Sprouts and it did not disappoint once again.   I had the special which was a salmon filet with white wine cream sauce, capers and tomatoes served over a bed of roasted potatoes and grilled asparagus. The fish was cooked PERFECTLY which is a big deal to me. I've also decided to try and replicate the sauce in my own kitchen because I couldn't embarrass myself in a restaurant by licking up the sauce on the plate so I'll have to do that in the privacy of my own home. The potatoes were cooked and seasoned beautifully and the asparagus was what you would expect in a fine dining establishment. If you know how to grill asparagus then there's no worry about screwing it up.  I'm concerned about this place though. Both times I've been it was kinda dead. There was a small stream of traffic that came in spurts but nothing like I would expect for a Saturday at lunch time. The price isn't unreasonable for what you get but its possible people are expecting a much cheaper menu because of its location. I just hope the strip mall curse that lingers over this Valley of the Sun doesn't strike this little restaurant gem. Those of us who don't like spending our dining dollars on chain food really appreciate these kinds of places so here's to hoping word gets out.

I had no idea this place was here and I go to this shopping plaza probably 2 or 3 times a week. I think its because its tucked in the far southeast corner so its pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it.  What can I say? I'm SO happy to have a new breakfast place that is cheap with good portions and menu choices. I ordered the veggie omelet which was good, oozing with cheese but I would have reviewed it as excellent if it had more veggies. Their rosemary potatoes might be almost as good as mine!  My daughter ordered the Berry French Toast and this could honestly be a dish to split between two people. It was made with good bread (crucial in my book) may have even been brioche and they sure didn't skimp on the berries!  The prices are very good too so if you need to feed a family on a budget this is a good place. Service was a bit slow but they were packed which is always a good sign.

Some co-workers were going here for lunch and since I had a meeting I asked if they would pick me up a salad and bring it back. Having dined with them many times before they knew I would probably like the Strawberry Dividend with Chicken. Unfortunately, they didn't think to look at my order when they were leaving. But when they got back to the office I was rather disappointed to see a pile of lettuce that could fit in the palm of my hand (I'm a small woman), four slices of strawberries and half of a mini croissant. Mind you this is a $13 salad. None of the other stuff that their online menu says it should have, almonds, chicken (the protein ya know), etc.  So mistakes happen right? I call the restaurant to see if they would fix the order and I'm told no. But next time I come in they'll comp me a salad. Ya, there won't be a next time. Every successful restaurant manager knows you don't always get a next time. Hopefully, the managers at DSR know this now too and they have alot of competition in this area that serves far superior food.  BTW, the mini salad tasted terrible too. Heading the vending machine in the break room now.

Empanadas!! I can't remember the last time I saw empanadas on a menu in AZ so I'm thrilled to have them in my 'hood now. In fact, the last time I had an empanada was in LA. I would say these are the star of the menu and they have over a dozen sweet and savory to choose from.   I also had the green chili chicken enchiladas which was really good but they forgot to put the side of rice with my order and since I ordered to go I didn't notice until I was home.   This place is new and still working out the kinks. I agree with the other reviews that its not really designed to be a dine in experience unless you're solo or maybe a party of two. The girl running the counter seemed a bit overwhelmed with 3 people in the place.   But the concept is great and there's nothing like it around. I will probably call in my order in the future. But I'm so happy to have empanadas!!!

Like many others here I've experienced the games and cons of the billing office when trying to cancel a month to month membership. I think their belief is if they just don't return your call then they can keep charging your card every month and maybe you won't notice. To me thats a sign the business is struggling and may not be here one day. After canceling the membership in person and being told they were sorry to see us go but that all was taken care of I noticed my card kept getting charged every month. Call, ask to speak to management - told they will call me back. Call again - asked to speak to a billing contact or department - leave message (went thru that cycle at least 4 times). Called the corporate office twice - nobody answers the phone at "corporate" apparently - and left a final warning message that I will now be taking action through my credit card company.   Guess how many return calls I received after all the attempts mentioned above? NOT ONE - nada - zip. What kind of business is run like this???? Luckily my bank agreed and disputed the charges and sent me a new card with a different number. The pain here is now I need to keep watching my credit reports because they're likely to try to write off the debt by sending it to collections.   Save yourself the headache and avoid this place. They likely won't be around soon anyway and there's plenty of reputable fitness centers in the area.
