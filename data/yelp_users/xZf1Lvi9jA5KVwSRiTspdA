This place is kind of buried in a dead little strip mall opposite of Joe's Grotto and can be a little less than eye catching from the outside. Once inside, you can tell it's has been around for a while. However, I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing.   The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary. The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix.   They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here, although they do have a lot of business on the take out side. We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items. The one we usually get includes Wonton soup, the Poo Poo Platter (lol), Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by), Sizzling Shrimp, House Special Chicken (best chicken ever), Mushu Pork, and Peking Fried Rice. And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares.   Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious, memorable and authentic Chinese meal.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! You really can't beat the fun atmosphere of the rotating sushi bar. The food here is pretty good and they will cater to any special roll requests people have and the staff is overall very friendly. Definitely a favorite hangout for my boyfriend and I if on the east side.

I had my first visit here on the way home from work off of the 51 & Indian school as I was desperately searching for a bakery. Since this place is in a predominantly Hispanic area, I was a little apprehensive to visit as sometimes people can treat you a little differently if you don't speak Spanish (I am Mexican & Japanese but all gringa on the inside).    When I entered, I was greeted in English by a very nice lady struggling with replacing the paper in the cash register. She finished up and proceeded to help explain all of the goodies and different types of Conchas behind the counter. I ended up getting a dozen fresh tortillas, 4 sweet breads and 2 Empanadas for only $7.75.    I managed to devour one of the sweet breads on the way home and  was NOT disappointed. It was light and airy with notes of vanilla and by far the freshest I ever had. I will absolutely be back to this bakery and am eager to also try their tamales one day. If you don't mind the neighborhood, be sure to stop by, you won't regret it!

Great food and close to my work. Haven't had a visit here without it being packed. They also sell their enchilada sauce here which I use everytime I make them for the family...sometimes cheating good lol.

I wish they had a negative star option to accurately rate businesses like this. I called, scheduled and confirmed my address the previous week for the following Tuesday.   The day before my appointment, I had left my cell phone at home, only to return to a message stating he had "accidentally deleted my address". When I replied with my address, he stated that he booked over my previously CONFIRMED appointment. He then offered to rechedule for 5:30 PM that evening.   When 5:30 came around, he did not show or call or text. I also had plans that night which I had to reschedule for someone who didn't even have the courtesy to at least call to provide another excuse.   Silver lining: I found The Headlight Guy (also on Yelp) who contacted me fo my quote within an hour of reaching out to him,  did an amazing job on my headlights and interior (for the same price as this jerk was going to charge me for just the detailing) and was professional, friendly and extremely thorough.   IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GREAT SERVICE, LOOK UP THE HEADLIGHT GUY INSTEAD AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE.

After missing a doctor's appointment in Chandler, I decided to try and find a place where I could get my oil changed. I looked around on Yelp and found Ron's to be one of the most highly rated shops around that area.   I called with about 20 minutes till closing but they agreed to fit me in. The manager was working the counter and was very personable and professional. After finding out that this was my first visit, he even offered to give me a HUGE discount on all of my services there that day!  They were able to finish everything up in about 12 minutes or less and did a great job. I would highly recommend Ron's to anyone looking for super fast and friendly service.

This place is so good. Everything is fresh and perfectly grilled and friendly service too. We come here pretty much every Sunday.

Absolutely adore this place, great coffee, service & food.   Vogava is tucked away in a strip mall between Rosati's and Tutor Time so it isn't really visible from the main street (Bell Rd). Hopefully that doesn't affect their business because I absolutely love their coffee! From the first time I visited the service was unbeatable and the coffee has been consistently spectacular- they even take call-in orders to make it easier for people on the go. Also, the staff here seems to be genuinely  passionate about what they do which shows in the final product.   I'm now a regular here and really hope the business does well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone sick of the over priced burnt dog poop Starbucks dares to call coffee. Stay thirsty my friends!

The smoothies here are pretty yummy. Ill admit I've only tried the chocolate peanut butter and pina colada but it's nice that they also have kid smoothies for my littles. The staff is all pretty friendly at each location and service at the drink station is pretty good.

I'm ashamed to say that I had managed to avoid going to the dentist for many years until I found Dr. Larson's office on Yelp. I liked the fact that they were open on Saturdays and was even able to request an appointment online.      Dr. Larson was professional, friendly and had a very calming demeanor which really helped put me at ease. Being almost 7 months pregnant, I had several concerns which he patiently discussed with me and his dental assistants were friendly and personable as well.     Ultimately I received my X-rays, exam and a full cleaning (which he completed himself) for less than $100 and have a sound dental health plan going forward. I am really grateful to have found Dr. Larson's office so I don't have to be afraid of going to the dentist anymore.  :)

I have been to the dentistry twice now and have seen both doctors and have interacted with most of the staff. Every single one of them was extremely personable and asked how i had been since giving birthto my daughter. The doctor even asked about my husband's sleep apnea and gave me some advice on ensuring his health and well being as well. This showed me once again that they genuinely care and take a lot of pride in their work . I actually look forward to going to the dentist now and will continue to go to and recommend Paradise Hills dentistry in the future.

Being there's no option for zero stars, they get 1.   Came here for lunch on a Saturday with my husband as he had heard about this place in the New Times as one of Scottsdale's top 5 new restaurants.  When we first walked in we were impressed by the decore and murals on the walls but noticed that the whole place was empty except for one other table in the bar area, and it was all downhill from there.   Our waiter had just finished smoking so he was rather fragrant when he greeted us and suggested the quesadilla or the nachos. He didn't give us much time to decide our selections, though whatever we decided would not make an appearance for another 40 minutes or more. My husband opted for the quesadilla and I had the Lobster with pasta ribbons and we split the calamari.   The calamari was decent but arrived 40 min later, and our food was another 50 minutes. The quesadilla was at least edible but the pasta was not. The lobster was old and rubbery and the pasta lacked any flavor other than  a fishy aftertaste. The waiter did bring us a random dish of sliced pinapple which I opted for over my food. I left annoyed, hungry and dissappointed and will go back around the same time as I hire Casey Anthony as my babysitter.  NOTE TO CHEF: I find it hilarious that every bad post for this restaurant is matched by a low blow to the Yelper for "other negative" reviews. Be a man and own up to your opportunities instead of making superficial caddy excuses to justify the terrible experiences at Renegade. If you really "appreciated" the feedback from customers you wouldn't react by insulting them for providing their honest opinion.

I always get the Wildcat Omlette, comes with country potatoes and warm corn tortillas, it's really good. My kids always get one of their french toast or pancake combos. Their service overall is pretty fast but they're so busy that they probably just have to be able to keep up with the customer turnover.

I had called around & received quotes from at least 4 other well rated moving companies I had found on Yelp, but the coordinator at Dose quoted me the lowest rate and gave me the most straightforward explanation of service (3 guys, 2 truckloads, gas included and a $100 deposit that would be applied to the total cost afterward) , so decided to book with them.      On the actual day of the move,  4 guys showed up 40 minutes early and proved to be extremely polite,  helpful,  honest, careful and efficient. Halfway through the load,  the owner showed up with another trailer and helped with the rest of the move to get it done more quickly (no additional charge).       Not only were they amazing and true to their price,  but they did everything with a smile and on a 115 degree day! After the move, the owner even provided us with some advice for future move strategies. I would highly recommend this company whenever you're in need of great, dependable & friendly service.

A coworker intruduced me to this place and he is my new best friend for it! The owner is super nice and the food is amazing. It is surprising when you visit the actual location because it is in a little strip mall hard to spot from the street and the inside is just all kitchen with no dining option.   I have been here twice and had the Mofongo and Carne both times and I don't know where to begin. The savory mashed plantains are made with garlic and butter and the fried pork is crispy on the outside but moist and flavorful on the inside. I was also undecided about the slow roasted pork dish vs. the fried pork so the owner gave me a sample, which was also delicious.   You will also be pleasantly surprised by the amount of food in each dish. Essentially both my husband and I can share one of the combo dishes and be full. Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area.

Greg & his wife are my heros! I previously scheduled an appointment with another business  (Bumper to Bumper- of which I just wrote a scathing review, referring others here instead) who ended up scheduling over my confirmed appointment only to stand me up upon rescheduling.   Greg O. contacted me within the hour for my quote, ended up doing an amazing job on both my headlights,  interior and exterior for the same price as I had been quoted elsewhere for just the detailing. He even worked on my car on Easter and spared no effort in making sure the finished product was a true representation of his work ethic.   I don't even think my car was THAT clean when I bought it! It really means a lot to me that there are still good people like Greg and his wife out there that do honest and beautiful work. HIGHLY RECOMMEND contacting them.
