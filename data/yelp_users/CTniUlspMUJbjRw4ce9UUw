I would rather stick a toothpick between my toe nail and kick a soccerball than to go to this Leslies again!  OMG!!!  Very Rude and they sell me everything under the sun.  Quick hint.  Take a water sample to this Leslies, then take one across the street to the other pool store, they are a chain too across the street!  I'll give you 20 bucks if you end up cheaper at Leslies!  I think the kids behind the counter are there to sell and not anything else.  Plus with big chains they hire 16 year old kids to give me advise on my $50,000 swimming pool.  I wouldn't ask my 20 year old son about my $45,000 BMW.  Shame on me!

That is a funny review!  You really know how to write!  I have had the same problem at this leslies.  Then I went to another and they just don'w care at any of the 4 I have tried.  I just goto home depot now and if I need water tested I go to Cactus Valley down the street.
