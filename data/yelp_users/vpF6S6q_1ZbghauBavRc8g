Definitely recommend.  Shrimp Pad Thai was the best. Would love to try the Mango Cheesecake next time.

I've been going to Pong Pongs for almost 20 years. Take out, delivery and dine in.  Love the Sesame Chicken ( ask for extra spicy) Wor Won ton soup is a must. Especially when you're sick. Big portions! Always have left overs. And yummy egg rolls.

Sushi is very good and very fresh.  Only complaint is how loud it is. Small place. So gets noisy. Other than that l, it is great! Definitely recommend it.

Stick with the rolls and ramen soup. We loved the Poppin rockin sushi roll. And we tried the ramen soup. Came back 2 nights in a row. Service is so so but other than that, we loved the place!

Love coming here. My daughter and I always fuel up here before we hit the stores.  Fish is always fresh. Love the Spicy sashimi salad! Definitely recommend it.

Service and food used to be so much better here. The staff is more interested in socializing with each other than the customer themselves. Even heard a few "F bombs" from one of the employees.  New management also. Didn't even get a hello. Used to all the time from the old management. Went without a drink for 20 minutes before anyone noticed...AND WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR! AND one of the only ones left. SMH. So dissapointed. Used to really like this place. The only thing I can say are the wings are still good. No more Tacos and Tequila for me. At least not the restaurant.
