As a collector I appreciated he was helpful in locating what we were looking for. He is however pushy and overbearing.   Nothing is priced which is always a bad sign. We were armed with smart phones and my knowledge as a record dealer myself.   He priced a record that sells for 12 shipped on eBay at 40. A record that sells for 40 online in ex condition was quoted at 100 and the condition was vg.   In 1.5 hours 4 people wanted to buy items and zero people did.  I am not a cheapskate but I'm not an idiot either. I will pay fair market average,  but not double.

This is the best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the Phoenix valley area. Moderately priced, but not super expensive.   It also serves a style of food many non vegetarians will enjoy.

I'm probably the longest customer; I came here when it was veggie fun and just bought from the old owner. Green has come a long way but after a visit back to Arizona, this will be my last trip.   I am accustomed to prices at casual restaurants in California with higher rent and higher wages. The current menu price increases put them higher than California restaurants and definitely full service prices with out full service.   Will not be returning as the prices cannot justify the service and quantity.

Was told this place had soccer games. Called to find out if they had the la galaxy game (which was on fox sport west) and was told "we have all the soccer games, we've never missed one". Although the guy had no idea who the galaxy were and was not knowledgeable about soccer.  We drove a few miles there.  The waitress had no clue to anything soccer related and simply pointed to a schedule chalkboard.  As expected only premeir league games.  What made this especially upsetting was that they were playing a college (american) "football" game on one tv.  This place does not play any major league soccer games and instead shows college football!!!! Also, so much for the "we never miss a game" I was told in reference to major league soccer.  But the guy obviously had no idea what he was talking about and I was skeptical going there in the first place.

Star ratting is based on SERVICE!!  Service is unreliable.  Sometimes you get ok service, but a majority of the time its HORRIBLE service.  I've had waitresses make a fuss when we wanted to change tables cause she seated us at a dirty table.  My potatoes arrived burnt and i got attitude when I asked for new ones (they were literally black).  On another occasion I was served a chicken wrap (I am vegan, and ordered veggie).  I didn't know it was a chicken wrap until I bit into the wrap.  Had a discussion with the manager about that.  On a separate occasion, I received a dirty cup, so I asked for a different glass.  The waitress was too busy or couldn't be bothered to help us so a "runner" brought out a new glass.  This glass was ALSO dirty (there were black marks on the glass)...the runner had an attitude and suggested he bring me a disposable cup, finally he brought me a clean glass.  The food is just as unreliable, but I'd say more often than not it is good, just not worth the service.  If it was not so hard to eat vegan in the valley I probably would never come here.  The hummus is ALWAYS yum yum yum.

Home of:  Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Room, Birdemic....Horror/Sci Fi festivals, cult movies, and anything independent and anything worth seeing.    Run by people who really care, and pretty much a non profit organization from what I understand.  It exists for the artistic community and theaters are available to rent for events, movie screenings, concerts, parties, etc.  There are always fun people to hang out with, and I enjoy sitting and chatting with friends in the lobby before or after the cult movie showings.  Many turn into mini events, sometimes with vendors and pre shows. Screw Harkins, and screw AMC...this place is where its at.  Sure the place might be old, but its not filthy, and its all about the atmosphere of the people.

I came here for the retro games. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS HORRIBLE!!!!   I came on a sunday afternoon; HUGE MISTAKE!!! It was pretty much a loud sports bar for football that just HAPPENED to have a large collection of retro games.  All the jocks that I tried to avoid as a kid (by going to the arcade) were there cheering on their favorite football team.  As for the games there, they are all 50 cents each!! Mr Do! and Ms Pacman have speed chips so fast, they are near impossible to play.  Furthermore, half of the classic games were broken at the time.  Missile Command, Dig Dug, Centipede, Gauntlet, even the Simpsons, and many many more; all broken!!!  I was told the tech for the games comes in on monday, wednesday and thursday.  I would recommend coming those evenings for a better chance of the games actually working.

I had high hopes for this place.  We were drawn in by the vegan and vegetarian signs.  There are tons of signs. On the other hand, we came in at dinner time on a saturday and the place was empty; literally. We were handed menus and were shocked to see it was a regular restaurant with small vegetarian section.  We were about to leave and told them we thought it was a veggie restaurant and then we were handed veggie menus.  We ordered soy beef noodle soup and the waitresses was gonna put in an order for real beef. We had to tell her four times.  Needless to say we were very worried. The cook came out and double checked our order and assured us we ordered vegetarian dishes.  The soup was good. However after our meal, their credit card machine was down and someone had to call in the card number over the phone.  The cook (owner??) seemed really nice and she said she was veggie and was transitioning the restaurant.  In my opinion this place could benefit from going 100% veg and advertising.

Awesome to have vegan and vegetarian options in the Far East valley.   Foods are based more on homemade whole foods instead of processed fake meats.   Friendly and knowledgable staff.  Will definitely return!!

Previously they were only Raw and juice. Now they also have cooked vegan food.   Great food, friendly service, and very personable.  Feel good about supporting a local vegan business
