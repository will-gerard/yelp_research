I didn't get to finish my checkin so to contribute to the reviews... The entire experience was great! Made the appt and they give you an hour- you will need it. They have some coffee if you're an early morning appt, so don't worry about stopping before.  We also grabbed the delicious fruit crispy pastry that was fresh, crispy and delicious.  Stacy was very sweet and after she described her husbands birthday cake and that he also used to be a chef, I just want to be their best friends and BBQ on the weekend.  Highly recommend this place!  I've read other say the wedding day turns out delicious and I can understand why they come back for left overs because I started small bites to taste each flavor but ended up wanting it all.  The peanut butter is fantastic... Wow.  Will follow up with a review after other tastings if needed and after the wedding day!  Thx Stacy!

Wow so ok... From the words of our server, "In order to "class up" the same menu z Tejas has adjusted the menu."  Don't be fooled- it's the SAME menu, they want you to drink for cheap at $5 per drink but they want you to pay more for the same food as before in order to earn a star or put some cash in the CEO's pocket book.  Oh...  NO MORE COMPLEMENTARY CORNBREAD.  They're masking it with "we donate proceeds to ..." And next they'll give 50% of the proceeds somewhere else...  This is not a fine dining restaurant. It's a happy hour with a bar.  If you want to attract a crowd or earn a star, change the menu and your style of serving.   Wow. Disappointed returning customers and Won't be back.  How's that for your pocket book.

So start off the grounds weren't kept up very well and it it's in downtown Phoenix.  this place wants a $1500 outside catering fee or or you can pay $26 per plate for any type of food which means that they arent good at making any specific type of food.  Charges for September and December are cheaper but are more expensive than the nice places in Scottsdale.  If you're looking for a wedding or just a reception or any event for that matter don't go here.

Ok first off it's no wonder she's highly rated and tops yelp for "cooking classes for couples" - my wife had asked about doing a cooking class for a date night so I did a little research.    We had already attended the frys on shea baking night making scones where we just helped the chef... It was more an informational class to sit across the bar because I suppose their insurance doesn't allow you to really get involved there.  Other courses in the valley are larger scale classrooms with more students where you won't get as involved and you may as well watch a video online for free.   I have to say when I talked to Maggie about how the structure was and if we cooked or helped, I was happy to hear that her response was "oh, I give you an intro and sample how to make things but you're doing the prep and the cooking."   She gave an intro that is great for beginners and culinary experts alike. Pay attention during her review of recipes though, because the rest of the class will be sharing your dish when you are done preparing it.   The kitchen environment allowed for plenty of room for six people in our class to both cook and move around safely as well as plenty of preparation knives, cutting boards, measuring and mixing bowls, A beautiful set of all clad cookware and a gorgeous Viking 6 top gas grill.  If you're concerned that it needs to be a professional kitchen for classes I'd say she and her husband setup the kitchen in a professional manner.   My wife and I absolutely loved our date night, the prep work together and with the other classmates, and the food to top it off was awesome!    My advice to this :  Be hungry- there will be a ton of food to enjoy!  Bring wine :)  Take notes so you can make the dishes again at home.   Thank you Maggie!

Outstanding and friendly service - and looks doggy friendly - and the crepes are spot on in comparison to my favorite French made crepes of Colorado's crepes n crepes.  The coffee was amazingly delicious - had the almond milk mocha mint, highly recommended! Go visit or frequent this place!

Wow the servers run around they r so amazing fast and hard working- and they make the sushi nice and tight w fresh product, great cuts to the fish w respect, beautiful playing, and big portioned rolls. Don't bother w groupon cuz u get a better deal with their 40 and 50% off's & they make more money instead of sharing profits with groupon- I'm curious what happy hour order prices are?... They were already only $6 and $7.  Service of the food was quick and the refills on kiddo soda were always topped off.  Highly recommend the fried rolls and really any of the other rolls were delicious!

We had the pastrami and chicken salad sandwiches today.  The chicken salad sandwich is just like that old fashioned delicious one you had as a kid! The iced teas are delicious flavored.  Be ready to pay $10 for anything you order- everything is fresh and made to order. No sloppy limp salad or fast food assembly here.   What I found really profound though flavor wise is the goodies.  She comes in early and makes up batches of whatever it is for the day and when they're out, they're out... So don't miss it.  Today was chocolate croissant w chocolate drizzle... Anyone that's been to noci café it's definitely giving some competition.  Then there's the blueberry chocolate chip... Well... Muffookie... Or cuffin? It's like the perfect balance of a cookie and a muffin.  Yum!

Ok #oinkcafe, take some notes from EGGstasy on the prosciutto benedicts and brûlée white chocolate raspberry pancakes omg! Anyone coming to Phoenix MUST stop here. Do a "bene with a half order side" (that way you still get the side with $2 off same as with the eggs/omelettes).  We added avocado to ours, truly amazing! The pancakes don't even need anything extra- they're amazingly better or equal to the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes which have always been our fav.  Thank you #EGGstasy you're our fav breakfast place in town and we love you so much!  The chefs are so friendly and they're passionate about their food- coming back to try the Dutch apple brioche French toast and protein pancakes made from natural protein starches- NOT a protein powder.  Crazy awesome!

Wow. We don't want to reveal too much because you'll just need to stop, taste, see, and meet the two folks running the place.  They make their own chocolate, from the bean.  There's $10 tours or $75/person make your own chocolate.  The chocolates are beautiful and decadent which you'll find just from the samples but buy a bar so you can enjoy it afterwards too!   Missy grabbed the hibiscus caramel- omg yummy made from crushed hibiscus leaf.  And the turtles look like turtles! Ha!
