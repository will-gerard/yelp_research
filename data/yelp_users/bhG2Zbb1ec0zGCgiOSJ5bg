This is a neighborhood bar and grill located in Windsor Square. I like to sit at the main bar here because you always get roped into some conversation with the friendly bartenders and the folks sitting next to you.   Their regular beers are good or OK and I usually get the Trooper IPA. However, they usually have seasonal or special beers of the day, which almost always contain a double or triple IPA, which are great.   As far as food it is definitely bar food but I do enjoy their nachos (not really the best thing on the menu, I'm just a sucker for nachos), wings and fries. I do hear their fish and chips are superb as a gentleman from Vancouver wouldn't shut up about it one night.  Sun Up runs a lot of specials like Chili dog Monday (Chili dog and beer for $6), Wing Wednesday and Happy Hour all day Sunday.

This is a great place to drink, chill and listen to live music downtown. The beer selection is superb and rare and there is usually a "deal of the day" or three. Sometimes it can be packed or difficult to get a drink as there is only one line, especially on First Friday. I love seeing (and playing) live music there, though the viewing place is small and gets crowed fast. It is in an old converted house which adds to the appeal of the venue.

I am only doing 1 star because I cannot do 0. I sent my grad schools project 4 days early via UPS store and had to do it with a  "Guaranteed" 2 day delivery". Even though it was 4 days out. It still did not make the deadline. It flew to Louisville, which was 1,618 out of the way, and did not make it out on the truck on time for reasons that were "unexplainable". I could have drove to Ashland, OR from Phoenix, AZ  and back, quicker than their "service". You owe me $5.000 for the classes I failed because of you. I will not use the UPS Store again, well, after they refund my money.  #WhatCanBrownDoForYou #Logistics  #IDemandAReFund

I love TMI, one of my favorite restaurants and hangout spots in town. The best time to go is on Sunday and Monday for Happy Hour for half off beer (which can be dangerous). I love sitting outside in the patio and listening to old school hip hop. Great date place, group place and dog friendly.   They have a rotating taps, which usually has at least one awesome and rare IPA such as Green Flash West Coast or Coronado Islander.   The food is great too. I love their salads like the Baby Bleu and the Winner. The grilled cheese, Artichoke Heaven and Jive Turkey are all phenomenal too. I would stay away from the olives though, as it is probably the only thing I've sent back to a kitchen ever.
