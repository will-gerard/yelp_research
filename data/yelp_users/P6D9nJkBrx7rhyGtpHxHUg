Where everyone knows your name.   Local bar was a great view of the ice rink.  And pages of beers to pick from.

Hayley works magic here.    I was concerned about going to a mall to get my hair done, but it's not an issue.  Appoints are always on time, no waiting for other to finish.  The color is perfect every time, no more gray here.  All the other women that work there are friendly and very talkative, makes a person feel welcomed.

Had a birthday coupon, so i went to pick my a treat for myself.  I found an item and the sign read $9.99, perfect.  When i got to the register, the item was really $23 and change.  When i told the associate about the sign and there was more than one of these items sitting by it, she went to find the sign.  As it turns out, the sign was for a smaller version of the same it. but they sold me the larger one for $9.99.

No repeat visit here.  Service was bad and took too long to get our food.  When we got the check it had a total but didn't show how she got the total.  I still think she ripped me off.  Food was ok but not good enought to make up for the bad service.

Desiree did an amazing job.   The hair cut and style are perfect for me.    Come early so you don't have to wait.  Shop is small but everyone there really is fantastic.   I'll be back.

Ask for Ben if you go to the bar.  He'll make sure you leave happy.  He turned my yucky drink into the best. Having another one.

This was my first and only visti to this sports grill.  Went there for lunch today and I will never ever go back.  Unless you are a male or have a male in your party good luck getting any service.   The men got refills on their drinks four or five time, my female cowork and I had to ask for the one refill that we did get.  The men got their food in a timely manner, we had to ask how much longer for our food, maybe she didn't put our order in right away.   We both had burgers and needless to say they were nothing great.  The bun used on the burger takes away from all the other flavors in the burger.  The food was just plain,  When we were done eating I had to go find our serve to get our check.  We spent almost an hour in this place and it wasn't very busy.  All the other tables seated after us were empty and cleaned up and we still had our dirty dishes sitting there.  Again, not a good place for two females to got grab a bite at.

After spending 10 minutes in the drive thru, I leave here with nothing.   The guy at the window was not friendly,  didn't acknowledge me or even great me when he gave me my drink. Then to top it off, my drink was not made correctly.  Someone,  please train this guy on how a Starbucks associate should treat their drive thru guest. I'll never come back to this one again.  Looking for a Dunkin Donuts now.

Best insurance rates in town! Staff is very helpful and supportive and Jayson is wonderful to work with. I save money every time I renew and I work and work in downtown Phoenix area.  If you are looking for great rates and service call Jason and his team. They will cover all your auto, home, and life insurance needs.

I have been a fan of Corleone's in Phx for a long time.  However, the Scottsdale location does not have the same standards.  No fries, watered down tea, and dirty tables, I saw 4 staff members and no one was cleaning the dinning area.    The bread on my sandwich and the pretzel were both hard.  Will not be coming back here again.

Very long wait time  even with my appointment.  In the long run, so worth the wait.  The doctor was very good at what he does, made a plan to get me better and set the wheels in motion.  Went back the following week for a procedure and am now on the road to recovery.  ENT  issues,  this is the place to get better

Poor service again.  I waited at the computer for call in orders and I got ignored.  As I stood in line someone else walked up and got helped  right away.   The point of calling in was for faster service, not the case here. Will not be back to this location again

You are guaranteed a Cheer's experience when you walk into Euro Techs, Jerry  always remembers your name and the name of your MiNI.    The work done is beyond wonderful and the pricing is even better.  Pumpkin is now a regular there and she, my MiNi, wouldn't have it any other way.

A very warm and welcoming feeling from the time you walk in till the time you leave   Mayo takes the time to really understand how you feel and does a great job making you feel much better when you leave  If you've been wanting to try Acupuncture, this is the place to go

Went there for threading and Dayana did a great job.  She is the first person in AZ that  I'm going back to see.  She didn't rush, I didn't have to show her sections she missed, and she's not in a mall.   Well worth the trip to Scottsdale.

Wow, very slow for a Tuesday night. Went for happy hour with a coworker,  missed it by 10 minutes.  We did however stay for their Taco Tuesday.  Food was much better than expected.  Had chicken tacos,  meat was very flavorful. For sure would order them again.  Will have to come back in time for happy hour next time.

The blazing burger is everything they said it would be, wonderfully hot!    If coming for lunch, come early becaseu parking is limited unless you don't mind the street.  Nice outside seating and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great job Jimmy!

Wow, amazing food.  Tell them what you want and that's what you get. The Enchiladas are put together to your taste and the lava was for real.    Parking lot is too small and seating is a bit on top of eachother, so come early or take a late lunch.

If you are looking for a healthy breakfast spot, this is the place.  Food was amazing, portions were very large and the service was great.    If you get there before 9 on the weekend, there is no waiting either.  This place has only been open for a short time but you can't tell my the line of folks waiting for a table.

The move may have improved the experience.  Food was like home cooking and service was very good.    Ordered the wrap and it was enough for two meals, very generous on portions.

Food was  Smashburger good. Service was very friendly.  Had a Four Peaks  Peach  Ale with my lunch,  yep they  have Four Peaks in bottles.  Sat outside on the patio and enjoying the December sunshine.   I can see this place getting full at lunch time,  small parking lot up front but more in the back. Come early and enjoy a burger.

Drinks are really good,  I've had smoothies and coffees here. Good variety of flavors to choose from.  Service during the week is great, the young man that works there is friendly,  smiles and is a people person.  Today was a different story. The young lady was very close to being rude. Not friendly,  didn't smile at all and acted like I was bothering her.  She will be the reason I don't come back.  For the same amount of money I can go to Starbucks and get great service.  Who cares if the wait is longer.

Dr Amy is wonderful.  She actually want her patients to be better.  She takes the time to hear what is really wrong, hurting and where the pain is. Then she goes to work. 1st visit but I can't wait to come back.
