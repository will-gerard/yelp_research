We visited rokerij Sunday in their downstairs bar. We always love going in for their happy hour! Great small plates for $5 each between 3pm and 6pm.  We learned that they have half off bottles of wine sun, mon, and tues!  The food and service is always great. However, we were sad to hear that they are not doing the reverse happy hour late night that we frequent to often. Where are we going to go now? Anyone have suggestions for a new late night happy hour with great food?

My husband surprised me with a very nice dinner at Mastro's City Hall last night. We sat in the bar area at one of the side tables. We enjoyed a bottle of sparkling wine with our dinner. The beef carpaccio was delicious and it was a very large portion. Great to share.  I loved my  half portion of the Mastro's salad (with lots of shrimp). Its great that they offer half sizes on salads and sides. The server (Andrew) was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!

Arcadia Tavern is one of my favorite spots for Happy Hour! Such a great deal. From 4-7pm Mon-Fri.  I usually get the Ahi Tuna appetizer ($10) and the HH chardonnay ($5). I also enjoy going in on Saturdays. They have half off all bottles of wine during the summer! I love hanging with friends at the bar, but they do have a great dinning room that is kid friendly. And always great service.

I love this salon downtown with the views of old buildings and the cityscape center. I've had 4 visits so far, all using a promotional deal which includes 5 services. I have only have one more left for a facial, but I will definitely be back to see Jen B. She did a wonderful job with my hair cut and my glaze. (separate visits) She is a great stylist. I love my red color!  And she even went the extra mile and brought me coffee from Starbucks while my glaze was setting!

Narcisse is a beautiful place! I've been waiting so long for a champange bar in the valley! I consider myself a champagne connoisseur, so I had to go try it out! I was there on opening night as well as there new lady's night on Thursdays! I'm very impressed with the staff and service, as well as the by the glass list. I will definitly be back and will be bringing more friends! I highly recommend it!

We've had good experiences here before, but today didn't cut it. We sat at the bar so we could watch some Sunday football. The bartender greeted us quickly and got our drink order. The Bloody Mary I ordered was horrible. Very watered down and tasted like they put a shot of olive juice in it. I asked if she could spice it up which she tried to do. It didn't help. I ordered the southwestern wrap, it was ok. The avocado's were not ripe and had seed peal left on them. My husband had a burger..it was ok, nothing great.  Overall, service wasn't up to par nor was the food...to many other good choices around. Don't think I'll be back.

Not impressed... Friday night and early in evening. Bartenders are too busy talking with each other than to serve their patrons.  I will not be returning.

So happy there is a new seafood spot in old town! I went there with a buddy in town and and had  a great experience at the bar. The cocktails were delicious! I had the Riptide Rita!  For appetizers, we loved the bacon wrapped shrimp and the tuna poke! Next, we shared fish and chips, which came with a flavorful tarter sauce and fries. The restaurant is beautiful! I can't wait to bring more friends and sit on the patio!
