I am doing a favor to this place by giving them one star. Horrible service! You feel rushed the whole time. All the workers have an attitude problem. THEY DONT CARRY SPINACH, PEPPERJACK CHEESE OR AVOCADO! WTF!? And the jerks would not even put my bacon in the toaster to make it crispy yet it's ok to put my bacon in there if my whole sandwich is being toasted?? Screw this place... Avoid it at ALL costs.  They are marked expensive because their food sucks ass for one and their service puts the icing on the cake. They should pay me to walk in.

This place is fantastic! I've worked in the area for over a year and had no idea it was even here. The food is remarkable! I had the carne asada burrito which was very flavorful and not greasy at all. The tripas (taco) was cooked to perfection, as well. I will definitely be coming again. Highly recommended.

Guy in drive thru has Indian accent from hell and they don't carry ranch. This Jack sucks.

Great service at a fair price! They don't hard sell you anything and give you no BS assessments of what's going on with your car. They had my fiancee's AC fixed in a day (electrical issue) and it only cost $90! I will definitely use them in the future.

This is my printer ink source as long as they are around. The staff are so kind and helpful. Would strongly recommend them just for their customer service! The fact that they provide an exceptional product is just icing on the cake.  Prices are great! My printer takes 5 cartridges and each one was only $7.99!

I'm literally waiting for my meal right now, I hope it's good! --------------------------- MMMMmmmmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmmmmmm B*****!!!! Wow this is pretty damn good! I can't believe Ive literally worked across the street for almost two years and never checked this place out... Well, maybe I can... Carolina's is like 75 feet away lol   I'm not sure what that other reviewer was looking for/talking about but this place is definitely not as he described it. It's a little family owned place and it's a little warm inside but other than that, it's fantastic.   I ordered the 2 floutas dinner plate and was surprised by the portion size. These floutas are jumbo sized and taste great! Warm and crispy with some nice shredded beef. Beans are great! Rice is good, soft and moist. Salsa is chunkier than any other mexican place I've been to so I have no idea why the other reviewer said it's "watery"   Overall, if you're looking for a 5-Star Iron Chef Mexican Food Restaurant then you've came to the wrong place but if you want some quality Mexican food that doesnt end in "'tos" and has a "homey"

Amazing Filipino food. Sisig is so damn good. Everything is good! For a city that really needs culture, this place hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and try this out. The have bbq if you aren't too adventurous. Also, get a damn halo halo, they are amazing (personally, I would ditch the jackfruit because I can't stand the taste but you may like it).

This place is ridiculous! Don't be thrown off by the new decor... They make their food just like the original Carolina's. Food is second to none when you compare price to quality. Red chili burro with cheese and double wrapped! Yikes!   If you've never been here then you are in for a treat!

This place is the SH*T!!! Alex the owner is cool as hell. Real kick back shop and real professional. I've had the same Berber for 5+ years but I moved north and the drive was killing me. I gave "The Spot" a shot and homeboy delivered. Great cut, hot towel AND a shoulder massage (no homo) for $12! Even his little bald friend cut really good!   Hey if u live in the area and need a good fade or whatever then check this place out. It's definitely worth it.

I thought this place was the shit but after a few months I was dying to find another shop. The cuts are inconsistent, Alex is full of shit (I was told that I could get a cut anytime, even after hours and he would hook it up but when I actually had to take him up on this offer he refused), you're stuck listening to Russian the whole time and it gets very hot in his shop.   It's not worth it because your cut will be great or it will suck. You are MUCH better off going to Najib's down the road. I had written my original review for this place after the first visit... Lesson learned.

Terrible food and we will never come here again. Their wings resembled something you would see in an anatomy class or body exhibit (See Pic). The few that were normal lacked all taste. Their pizza was undercooked and chewy. Save yourself and avoid this confused restaurant at all costs. The theme is all over the place... Some contemporary mixed with some traditional mixed with a bar that resembles a frat house and lastly add in big screen TVs and sports paintings on the glass storefront. Wow...

Very nice and clean barbershop. They have several consistent barbers (5) who all do a really great job. I still live in Phoenix but make the trek out here to get my hair cut.

This shop provided me with a great experience and definitely won me as a customer. The owner was extremely honest and really a class act. It is not often that you find a shop that you can trust but for now, my search is over.

Are here because of the good reviews. My gf and I were not impressed. The meat (steak and chicken) were overcooked. The Fries are amazing though. I would come here if you wanted some really good fries but definitely not for the gyros.

You cannot beat this place for the price! The moist brisket is phenomenal and for 6.99 per 1/2 lb you can't beat it. Cream corn is great too! I've been to other bbq places in the valley which didn't taste as good and we're double the price. Do yourself a favor and come here.
