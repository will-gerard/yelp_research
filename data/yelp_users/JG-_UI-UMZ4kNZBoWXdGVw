No wonder no one at the company will give you their last names.  Robin, the "manager" is a psycho, Craig needs to be medicated and the receptionist, who is a moron, actually said "I dont know my boss' last name". Horrible. This isnt even my debt, and they fully disclosed ALL information to me.   I filed a complaint with the FTC, BBB and Attorney General.  Here are the websites if you'd like to file also:  www.bbb. org  www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/FTC_Wizard.aspx?Lang=en  www.azag.gov Click on the top of the page under Consmer and then Consmer Complaints.   Here is the complaint I filed and my experience with the company: I was contacted in June by J&R Brothers about a 2010 medical bill of my ex-husbands.  I explained that we had been divorced since 2005 years and that it was not my obligation.  The agent stated that if I provided my ex-husband's mothers phone number that he would remove me from his account.  He also fully disclosed the nature of the call, the amount, date and due party for the medical bill after I disclosed that I was not married when the bill occurred.  This is a direct violation of FDCPA guidelines.  After providing the agent with my ex's mothers cell number, he stated I'd be removed from the account.  Two months later I was to close on a home I was purchasing for myself and my children and J&R Brothers had placed a collection account on my credit which threw off my debt to income ratios.  I immediately called J&R Brothers and was prompted to leave and after-hours message.  I waited 4 days with no return phone call and called again and was prompted to leave a second message.  I received a call the following day and explained the situation to the agent.  He placed me on hold, returned, and demanded that I fax over a copy of the divorce decree.  I explained that it would be on file in the same place that he found my name in the first place.  I tried to explain that all of my documentation is in boxes since we were in the process of moving.  He said "do you want the fax number or not" I stated no, because - and he hung up on me.  I called back and spoke to his manager, Robin.  She proceeded to shout at me, tell me I was rude for not listening and hung up on me.  I called back to explain to her that its not that I don't want to provide the document, I simply do not have access.  I also explained that it was against FDCPA guidelines for her to report this on my credit or to even discuss the account with me.  She raised her voice again and said she was not going to speak with me and that I can fax it over or deal with it. I asked her where she found my name and she stated that she didn't know and wasn't going to pull the file to find out.  I let her know again that I do not have access to the document and that legally IÃ¢â*¢Ëm under no obligation to produce it.  She hung up on me.  I called back again and she picked up the phone and shouted, "IÃ¢â*¢Ëm not talking to you!" and hung up again.  I called back and left a message.  I received no return phone call so I called back again.  She picked up the phone and shouted, "You do not have permission to speak to me, I'll fix your credit!" and hung up on me again.  I have all calls recorded if the documentation is needed.

Cindy's is pretty much amazing.  I love a good hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop restaurant, and that's exactly what Cindy's is. They exude a quirky, charming, whimsical ambiance, coupled with prompt, courteous, genuine service.  Staff is consistently friendly and enthusiastic; you'll be flattered by how quickly they remember your name and usual order. The true allure is their absolutely incredible food. Delicious, home-made, affordable and always served in generous proportions.  My go-to favorites are the waffles with apples on top or the chicken fried steak, but you'd be hard-pressed to find something that wasn't amazing.  Swing in and give them a try, you'll be glad you did!!

We've used the Laundry Butler for about a year now and are very pleased with the service. I've referred several friends and family members to the company as well. Rich has been especially wonderful in communicating and coordinating with me. Having an acitvce family of 4, this service allows me more time to spend with my family.

Salt & Light exceeded my expectations, and I'm so happy I chose them! It's been 15 years since my last tattoo, but life threw me a curveball and I wanted to remember it forever. I searched Yelp, and Salt & Light just clicked with me. I was nervous going in, but Joel made me feel comfortable right away. He asked me about the meaning behind my tattoo, and with that knowledge, he helped me design exactly what I was looking for. He was patient and invested in my satisfaction with the result, and that meant a lot. Given that it was such a tiny tattoo, he could have dismissed it, but he made me feel just as important as someone coming in and spending several $100's. My tattoo has spiritual meaning, and he asked me if I'd like to pray before we started - I was blown away and even teared up. What a great place to work, and what an amazing staff. It's a simple tattoo, but I needed it to be perfect, and Joel delivered. It brings me joy every time I look at it. Thank you so much Joel and Salt & Light!  Here's the tattoo meaning if anyone happens to be interested:  A good friend's 11 week-old baby girl was diagnosed with heart failure and placed on the donor list. Having experienced something similar with my son, her journey brought up many emotions I hadn't felt for a long time. During this time for her, I offered support and sent several scriptures. One that ended up speaking to me personally was Psalm 61:2 "When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I." I've lived most of my life in a state of overwhelm, caught up in fear and control. This verse gives me the strength to let go and trust God to lead me, to release my fears to Him. When her tiny baby girl received a heart for transplant, we all watched a pure miracle unfold before our eyes. My Faith was reignited in a way I'll never be able to explain, and I hit the floor and released years of pain that I had been holding tightly to. My tattoo is placed on my left wrist in support of my dear friend and her baby (the same place she got her turtle tattoo). The "lead me" is from the verse, the mountains symbolize "the rock", and I have 3 kids, so the peaks are 3 different sizes to symbolize my 3 children. I love it, and I hope you do, too.

We hired Mike to paint the exterior of our current home that we were remodeling. I work in homebuilding and had several contacts that I met with prior to being referred to Trustworthy Painting. Mike far exceeded all of our expectations. We had the house done during the monsoon season, and there was some rainy weather. Mike stopped by a few days after the job was finished and noticed that the rain had caused the garage door to bubble. He fixed it right away and came back out an additional time to make sure it kept. Our house is gorgeous and several of our neighbors have popped by to find out who did the work. We're always quick to pass along his info, becuase we know the quality is excellent and his pricing is great too. We're not quite done with our remodel, so we'll be looking forward to working w/ Trustworthy again in the future.
