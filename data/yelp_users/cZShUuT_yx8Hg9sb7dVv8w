One of the great things about San Tan Valley - The Pork Shop! Most importantly their Green Chile Burritos! Freshly made and waiting for you behind the register, ask for one you won't be disappointed.  Good size, kick and amount of meat! Delicious.

Chen's is great for nearby Chinese food cravings. It's close, quick and very tasty. I am very impressed with their chow fun and Hong Kong style noodles.   Wish delivery was an option.

I've always had pretty good service here and I've always been happy with the salmon and steaks we pick up! Always good prices and great deals on the regular!

Pretty good for Chinese food right down the street. The best part is the fact that they deliver and give coupons for next time.  The spicy dishes are the best!

I have been going to this shop for the past year and a half and have always been satisfied. I have tried out all of the barbers there and found that all are professional and do a good job.   I personally have only been going to Tony for the last year and have never been to anyone else ever since. He is very personable, professional and he really cares about his craft. He can do just about any haircut but he can do a hard part w/ fade very well. I get my haircut from him every 7-10 days and it's worth every penny. If you want a clean cut and want to look good, ask for Tony!  The prices at the shop are very reasonable (~$15 a cut) and they are in a good location.

I am so happy we found YANAGI Sushi!   The service is great and the food comes out quick! The sashimi is so good that my fianc√© and I had to go the next day and get it again!   The owner Jen is a sweetheart and really wants you to feel comfortable.   If you want sushi don't waste your time looking anywhere else or trying something different...get the good stuff and come here!

This place has a lot of potential and I hope  it can find its footing. We ate here on a Saturday night and started with the fried zucchini sticks and a dozen wings (half medium/half hot). We ordered this at the same time we ordered our beers and happened to receive both at the same time (roughly 15-20 min later). It would have been helpful to have a list of all the beers on draft, but that's just on a side note. The wings had great flavor and had quite a bit of meat on them, definitely would recommend trying them. I ordered the Southwest Burger medium rare and it came out well done. Still gave it a shot and found that it still had good flavor as well. The tater tots were surprisingly very good with a nice crunch to them.  Not sure if they were just really understaffed that night or if it can be chalked up to the "newness" of the place and as it was just a bit disorganized. The waitresses were nice but it seemed like they were having a difficult time managing all the different tables as they didn't seem to have specific assignments. These are just some of the small details that added up over the night that led to the rating, including the two small styrofoam plates received for our apps at a table of four. Our waitress even felt compelled enough to apologize to us multiple times for, in her words, "terrible service".   Again, as far as the size of this place, the large bar, lots of pool tables, big TV's, good draft beer selection, and decent food, I think it has a lot of potential and I would like to come back to try again.
