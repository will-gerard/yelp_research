I've been here several times and have been completely satisfied with every visit.  It's a no frills kind of place in regard to their interior decorating.  Plain and simple even a little outdated, but they get the job done.  They offer all of your basic services for nails and even waxing although, I've only done regular manis and pedis.  I find that they really take the time to give a good foot & leg massage at no additional cost which is nice.  They also do a good job of scrubbing your feet and heels.  I've been to some places where they didn't put any elbow grease into it, but not these girls.  My friend gets gel every time and raves how their gels last longer compared to other nail salons in the area.  Tiffany gives a great pedi and Sally gives an awesome mani.  Every girl I've seen has been great, but those were the only two names I can remember.

I've gone to this location before several times and was satisfied with customer service and how my car looked every time; however, today was different.  I went in to get a regular car wash and vacuum, but was talked into getting a full car detail.  Which in actuality I was fine with since my car was in need of some tlc.  When I asked how long it would take to be done I was told 45 minutes to an hour.  I paid the cashier at 2:28.  At 3:30 I started to get antsy and at 4:35 when my car still was not done I was so over it.  My car was finally done at 4:45.  The car looked great and they really put in work on it, but if you're going to tell a customer that a service will be done by a certain time it should be done by a certain time.  When I explained my issue to employees one said "that sucks" and the other said that they shouldn't have quoted that time, but there was no effort made to try to make up for my experience.  Not even an apology.  Even a little sympathy would have been nice.

I had been looking for a primary care provider when a family friend suggested Dr. Cohen and Healthy Outlook and I am so glad that they did.  While the outside or surrounding area may not be amazing, don't let it fool you.  The lobby has a cool modern look.  Today was the second time I've visited the office and it was a great experience just like my first visit.  I woke up this morning needing to be seen so I called the office thinking I wouldn't be able to get in today, especially being New Year's Eve, but to my pleasant surprise they were able to schedule me in for the afternoon.  I showed up 10 minutes before my scheduled appointment and they took me back shortly there after.  No having to wait a ridiculous extended period of time after my appointment was scheduled, which has happened in other places, but not here.  Once I saw Dr. Cohen she confirmed what my google webmd findings led me to believe I had and prescribed some meds.  I appreciate that she takes the time to explain what's wrong with me and the meds I'll be taking.  I love that I feel comfortable about the whole visit and I've never left feeling like, "what'd she just say?"

I really love this place!  I found Yogurt Builderz because it's super close to my work.  Coworkers and I have popped in on more than one occassion for an afternoon pick me up.  They have some pretty standard flavors always on hand, but they also introduce some new ones into their lineup as well.  If you're unsure of what you want, don't worry, you can try some out before you make a final decision.  They have a wide range of toppings consisting of fresh fruit, cereals, nuts, candy, sauces, anything your wonderful little heart could desire.  Staff is always friendly and nice and it's always clean.  No toppings strewn messily around the bar and no yogurt messes either.  For repeat offenders they have a frequent buyer card, buy 9 get $3 off.  If you've never been, you're missing out!

I've been here several times and have always left happily satisfied.  On this particular visit my friend and I had an amazon deal where we got a pound of brisket and two drinks.  We also ordered Texas cream corn, coleslaw and mac n cheese to share.  We got the small portions for all of them and the size was just enough to try everything and be satisfied.  Brisket was amazing without the sauce, but even better with it.  Super tender.  Coleslaw and cream corn were great and I'll definitely have those again.  I absolutely LOVE the cream corn.  I could have a big ol' container of just that.  The mac n cheese was good.  Not great, but good.  The sweet tea was AWESOME.  They should bottle that up and sell it.  The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and offered suggestions.  I loved the little boys that were working and hanging out.  From the look of things it seemed like their dad owns or runs the place.  One of them was so sweet and polite.  We would ask for things and he would say, "yes mam, no mam, thank you mam".  He even asked how everything was.  I'd go back just to hang out with him.  The only thing I noticed different from when I visited over a year ago was that they no longer sell beer and while I'd like a Shiner to add to my Texas bbq experience, the food and the staff are enough to make me come back.

DD is the go to spot when friends and I are looking to get together for breakfast and I've never had a bad experience here.  The staff is great.  They're attentive and friendly.  I like that the manager can always be seen going around asking tables how their meal was.  I had to send something back once and he brought it back and apologized which I appreciated.  Mimosas are good.  Coffee is great.  I go so much that I try to have something different every time, but a girl is always going to have her favorites.  I had the Hangover sandwich last Saturday.  It was delicious.  I don't know what they do to their bacon, maybe they made love to it, but whatever they do it works.   Their Veggie omelette is really good.  Their bagel & lox is something that I'd have no problems not ordering ever again, you're better off having Einstein bros.  Traditional burger is a solid good burger.  I tried their Southwest Flannel Hash recently and it's different.  I haven't quite made up my mind on it yet.  Our server said they make it from scratch, which I love, but maybe if they grilled it to be well done it'd be better. Comes out looking like a pot roast.  I might give it another try before I write it off completely, but I can always stick to their DD hash.
