Not going to waste too much time on this review because it was so awful. Bottom line, unless your name is Gordon Ramsay, do not step foot in this restaurant. Our service was fine, but the food was undercooked (they breaded the halibut!??!?), mushy, and tasted several days old. This experience would have been forgettable and/or forgiveable if they weren't also charging $35/plate for the halibut "special". There are so many other restaurants nearby that charge less for a much better food experience. Bottom line, avoid Avanti.

Great experience with Camelback Moving. They were careful, attentive, and punctual. Couldn't have asked for a better moving experience.

This is a great local coffee shop with awesome crepes! My wife and I rode our bikes over for brunch. We both enjoyed the chipotle crepe. I had an Americano and she had a blended white chocolate. Both were very good. It's a great addition to the neighborhood, and we will certainly be coming back! Would love to see some bike racks in front though.
