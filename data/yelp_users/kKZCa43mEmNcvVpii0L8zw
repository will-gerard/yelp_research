We made a reservation for our anniversary and everything was amazing. Every server individually wished us a happy anniversary. The food was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor. The only down side was the price, but we were expecting it. Dinner for two with one alcoholic beverage each, plus an appetizer was $200, including tip.

Mediocre food and the service was comically bad. The refried beans tasted like they came out of a can and warmed up in a microwave. The chile relleno was bland and mealy.   I kept having to ask for the server to bring my iced tea several times after she brought everyone else's drinks.   I ordered a side of rice and beans (apparently the chile relleno doesn't come with it), which the server didn't bring when she brought the entree. I asked the server about it, and she brought just the beans. I had to ask again for the rice.   Then she kept bringing the wrong check. One person had to ask three different times. It was absurd. I won't be back.

Jeff, the manager, really knows his stuff. And unlike a lot of places that sell motorcycle gear, he doesn't treat women as second-class citizens.   He knows the capabilities and limitations of each helmet and can explain why one helmet is $100 and another is justifiably priced at $500. And then he makes sure that you get the right size helmet for your head. Because a helmet doesn't do much good if it won't stay on your head!  They also sell jackets, gloves, coms, and cameras, etc. and he knows all about them too because he tests them out himself. He's not just the manager of a store, he's a true industry professional.
