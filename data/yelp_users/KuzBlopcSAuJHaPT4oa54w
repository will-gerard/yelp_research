Currently eating salad with my fingers, while the family eats cold, greasy pizza, because even though they're 1.7 miles away, it takes over an hour to deliver a cold pizza... and apparently 30 minutes to get a fork "right out".  Thanks for the reminder of why we don't waste $40 freaking dollars on your nasty, cold crap... good thing it was so late, we were so hungry, no choice but to eat it. #rosatis #sucks! (For the guy who asked why I didn't have a fork... I was on a construction site... working my ass off in a vacant house. So no... I didn't have a fork.)

I have been going to this studio for 1 1/2 years now. Joining this studio was the best decision I've ever made.  I love that even if I take a few weeks off because of work, the people that teach and the people that work out there encourage me to get back into my routine.  I'm always amazed that they can kick my but back into shape in a matter of days.  The workout is ballet based in most of the classes and if you've ever seen the tone in a ballerinas legs, you'll understand why its the absolute most effective workout you could ever do.  I love that the studio is so personal and friendly. I absolutely look forward to 'quality time' with friends and stay healthy as well.
