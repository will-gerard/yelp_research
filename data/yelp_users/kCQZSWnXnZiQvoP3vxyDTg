I just joined this gym and I'm literally in love with this gym. I've been to others in the valley (24 hour fitness, LA fitness and The Village) but this gym is the best one.  The classes are amazing (that's the most important thing to me), there's one instructor, James that really knows what he's doing. I highly recommend any class he teaches, (I hate to over use this word but) he's amazing! The facilities are great and the locker room is well kept and always clean. They offer a one day pass and have frequent open houses, I suggest giving it a try!

Classic bad customer experience. Really bad customer service and over all experience. I bought the groupon now for a $10 private training or group training session and was so excited to for a good work out with a trainer. I've belonged to other gyms and have had wonderful experience with other personal trainers. I called bright and early and Seth was good at responding efficiently and we set up a time for later that morning. I showed up and the equipment was a little old and worn (the lady next to me on the stair machine said her machine was broken) but whatever its not the equipment that counts its the trainer. He had me do 5 minutes of warm up cardio and a 15 minute assesment so we he could see where my level of fitness was at. After I completed the assessment, he continued to ask me if I would be interested in training at his gym after our session and I politely said No because it was so far from where I live. At this point he said "Okay thank you for coming in, there's nothing else I can do for you." I replied that the groupon was for an hour and didn't mention anything about having to continue service with him or at that gym to receive an hour of personal training and he could please show me anything else. He refused and sent me on my way. I spent a total of 20 minutes there. Don't waste you time on this groupon or on this trainer.
