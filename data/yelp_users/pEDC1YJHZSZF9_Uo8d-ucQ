This Home Depot has the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Followup is horrible, service doesn't come with a smile, and it appears as if customers are a nuisance when engaging with store personnel.  I recently bought 25k worth of items and will never utilize Home Depot again for any large purchases.

Great experience today with the Pima Dental team and Dr. Schwartz! The most advanced dentistry technology and a consultative approach to patient care that isn't found in most practices today. Highly recommend!!

Love the Pizza and atmosphere here! The food is always great and staff is very welcoming. We have been coming here for years and it has turned into our very own version of "Cheers".

The food here is always great!! One of my favorite restaurants in the valley, I highly recommend the Hangar Steak, Beef Shoulder, or Crispy Chicken...can't go wrong! The beer selection is a plus because they serve Lumberyard Pilsner.

Poor customer service and followup. Messages on machine have gone days unanswered, this is primarily because nobody answers the phones. My appointment scheduled to get cabinet doors repaired was a no show, I am still waiting for a call back to reschedule a week later. Only reason they are getting two stars is because the installers were on time and worked quickly. (Must have been subcontracted)
