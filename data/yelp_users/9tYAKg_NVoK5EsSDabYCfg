We came in to stand around for about 5-8 minutes waiting to be seated, as there was a huge sign asking us to wait. Many staff members just walked by and then finally asked us if they could help us. My husband and I said yeah, just waiting to be seated like the sign said. After being seated, we orders drinks and an app. Jalape√±o peppers were average at best. We also got a pizza which was good , but took a while to come out. Had to flag down staff to ask for an additional ranch, as they didn't really check on how we were doing. Also had to put our drinks at the very end of the table for more water and even had to ask for our check at the end. In the end, I thought with 4 stars on Yelp we would have much better service.. It was really just average food with not so great service.

For a Friday night, wasn't a crazy long wait, maybe 20-25 minutes. We sat at the sushi bar to get seated faster. The guys behind the bar made me laugh but you could tell they were crazy busy. We got our app out fast and then all of our rolls to follow. Everything was tasty and fresh. If we lived closer we would come here more, but if we are in the area again plan to stop by for sure!

LOVE this place. It is truly addictive, and you want to go and push your self everyday. I started with a groupon and loved it. I have been going for now for 8 months and have seen such a transformation in my body. The trainers are great and really know when you need that extra support and push to get you to the next level. I am so happy I found a workout I enjoy and can never get tried of as it is always changing and challenging. I suggest it to friends and strangers. :)

I don't think I say anything bad about my experience here! Everything from the atmosphere to food to service was amazing.. Did I mention the food? My mouth is still watering from finishing up those delish banana fritters.. Save room for desert!! I went with a larger party and we had a handful of small plates, pig face dumplings, and pork belly and soft shell crab steamed buns to start. Everything was so yummy I wanted to lick the plates. Love this place and can't wait to go back and try more!

I thought I would give this place a second chance as it is super cute inside HOWEVER it was again disappointing. Last time I was there the service was extremely slow and our food was served cold, I thought it was due to them just opening. This time as we came in on a Sunday afternoon (over a year later) and we were greeted with someone saying we are really busy and don't have a bartender on working so it will take a while to get drinks. Could you go up front and order your food also. As there were a great number of tables open I did not see how they could be so understaffed. Way to set it up for another horrible experience. I don't see a third chance coming their way.
