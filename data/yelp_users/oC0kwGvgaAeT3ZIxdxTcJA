I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves.   That said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul.

Every day that Richard Z is in my hood, I play emotional Russian roulette with our lunch spot. Is he gonna hate it? Is he going to order the wrong item and blame me for the rest of the day? Should we go with the tried and true. Should we try a new locally owned small business gem and raise Phoenix out of the fiery ashes of its universal assessment as the smallest of the big cities? The guy's a real Nazi about his sustenance.   So today, as we're walking to Focaccia Fiorintina, where we just should have gone to begin with, I'm like, "OH! Do you like gyros? Your last name is Greek. Let's go to Athenian Express!"   Well, that was stupid. I really really really hate ripping on mom and pop shops. I hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants. But damn... You made me look like a REAL arsehole, Athenian Express.   Poor Richard Z has been lamenting about how empty he feels all afternoon. And being the people pleaser that I am, well, I'm just devastated.   The lady that took our order, no doubt a solid and very decent human being, was unwilling to play along with any banter whatsoever. For two extroverted numbskulls like us, it just takes a little bit away from the charm.  And the spanikopita arrives... I find it too spinachy. He finds it too bready. Just goes to show you can't please everyone, or in this case anyone.   My sandwich was literally inedible. Not because of the taste. I picked it up and the whole thing fell right apart. My tray looked like a murder scene. Ketchup, who for so long suffered as the understudy in this WAY off Broadway spectacle, played the part of my disappointment.   When I asked @spirit_fingers about his meat, he said, and I quote,  "It's not offensive."   I remember liking this place in my past life. Today, it was not good.

Big fan of this place despite the fact that it appears they changed the recipe of their Malai Kofta the last time I was there.   Their naan is delish! Combining a little malai kofta and palak paneer with their naan will get you laid on the first date. Money back guarantee. From me, not them. I usually get it to go and order ahead of when I think I need to because it tends to take just a bit longer than I love to get the food.   But all and all my experiences here have always been very good. Great Indian food in Phoenix.

I figured out my type. Nerdy girls. They have them. Retardedly hot.   I figured out what I like to put in my body:  Water, caffeine, grain alcohol and Jaegermeister  Beads (use your imagination)  Information/news  Fat  The Market Sandwich with Goat Cheese. Hoofta!  Hooph-ta!  I would say oxygen but I believe its entrance into my body is passive, created by the vacuum of my lung/diaphragm system.

This has nothing to do with Walgreens unfortunately. I've only had pleasant experiences there but everyone knows what Walgreens stores are about. Instead, I'm going to fill you in on a little known secret. Or at least to me. And I'd like to think I'm a glass half full of culture kind of guy.   Three words: Trojan vibrating ring!   Holy. Mother.   Yes, the 16 year old check out dude will wonder why you're buying it at 1:13 PM on a Wednesday afternoon but do you really feel like you need to hide your pleasure seeking ways from him. Make him jealous.

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.  I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me.   One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.  So guess what happened next?   Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.  What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

If I ever want to be reminded what kind of asshole I am, I just need to reread this review and I'll know.   Why is this the review that will serve as this reminder when I have so many Yelps explaining so much about that already? Well:  I went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.  We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed.   I was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor.   The bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, "Want menus?" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos.   AMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's true considering I was the only one drinking them.   The one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him.   All and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on "anthropological journeys."   Apparently, they put wine in their burgers if you're into that...

Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!  My friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good.   Everything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile.   Hepatitis schmepitiis...

I went there the other day to mail a package.   Scott, the guy behind the counter, was an interesting character. He was super beyond-all-reason helpful. He had this strange Southern accent that I've never heard before. He made the experience almost surreal.   Should you ever need Fedex services and you're in the area, go there. Ask for Scott. If he's not there go back later and see if he's working. It's worth it.   Other than that, there was just a lot of copying and regular business stuff going on.

Bruschetta: it's good.   Wine Drinkers: Unite.   Pompests: Make yourselves at home.   Weather: Open air seating. Mmmm.   Parking: Lick me somewhere inappropriate.   This place is ok. It kinda reminds me of My Florist, only tolerable. But tolerable's not fair. It's actually quite good. If you're a snob.   My friend Georgie pointed out to me recently that I only give back-handed compliments. Sometimes, one must smack around those we love, lest the measure of worth in their own hearts finds too giant a perch.

My thoughts on this place could fill a book. I like having my oil changed and car washed. Like a spring renewal no matter the time of year. Sometimes I feel like the stuff they tell me about my car is legit. Sometimes I feel like it's not. For instance, the passenger compartment air filter. They were totally right that it needed replacing. I was not all flattered by the $49 cost. I went on Amazon while I was there and bought two for $14.99. And then I went to youtube to find out how to replace it. That sort of thing. For what they do, they do really well. For what they SELL, well, they're not a not for profit.

If I had a child, or if I had a woman who claimed I had a child and I believed her, I'd bring that child here and drop that child off on the counter and trust that that child would be well cared for... That's how much I trust these bastards. They're the best of the best.

I grew up in this neighborhood but didn't really discover Uncky Sam's until I was ready to go away to college 35 years ago. I'm 85 years old and my taste buds have over the years been replaced with the desire for the youth I once took for granted. But if there's one culinary recollection that brings a little flutter to this old man's heart it's the phantom taste of a Cheese Hoagie, that phallic masterpiece of untold proportions from Uncle Sam's.   It's huge.   They don't let me drive anymore but once in a while I want to jump in a cab and order one for old time's sake with with an extra side of the hoagie dressing. And eat it over the course of six days. It's that good. And that big. The hoagies are cold. The grinders are hot. The ingredients are slightly different for each but good god is this place good. The fountain drinks taste like they are mixed with really gross water but I gladly put up with it because the sandwiches are soooooo good. I've never really ordered anything else and can't speak to the rest of their menu but if you want a really really really good sub try Uncle Sam's.

I'm pleased to see that Capriotti's has so many glowing reviews, which means I don't have to feel as bad about this bad boy.   Long story short: I ate there once I didn't like it. I ate there again, adding my own veganaise and vegan cheese to their veggie turkey sub and loved it. I ordered for a third time today.   Or actually my coworker ordered for me, which actually has some bearing on this story as you will see. I was prepared to go completely apoplectic on this Yelp but instead I'll try to keep calm and just say why I think it's a one-starer.  My coworker ordered me a large fake turkey sub. How do I know this with 100% certainty? I listened to her call. I have it recorded. We record every call. Trust me, there are good reasons to do this. Your business should too.   Anyway, so I listen back to the call and here's what happened. She said, may I please have a fake turkey sub with no cheese and no mayo. When he repeated it back to her, he said "Turkey" but because he also said mayo she corrected him on that and didn't reiterate the VEGGIE turkey. This sort of thing happens in the world. No harm, no foul.   However, this is important because when I brought it up that my mother fucking TWELVE DOLLAR sub was turkey, he basically said, "well that's what you ordered." I trust my coworker but, upon her recommendation, I decided to listen to see where the communication break down occurred. I wish there was a way to embed the call in here.   So at this point believe it or not I was still being pretty rational and I'm like no biggie. I'll just tell him. This fucking thing is unopened. Surely someone will order a Turkey in the next ten minutes...   Instead he basically said too bad so sad. So my eyes bulge and he's feeling like an asshole and says if I want to wait around he'll make me a new one. No fucking thanks. I get it.

You know food is good when Richard Z says the following:   "That was so good. I think I need to take a couple minutes to just suck on my tongue."  Thank you, Sir Richard Z for showing me the light. I would have never tried this place on my own but holy good god was it a taste experience.   I could give or take the weed theme but the food is just ridiculous.   I think the sandwich I ordered was called the Griefo... although that could be off by a few letters. But the combination of savory goodnesses made my heart melt.   I'm a huge Eegees fan. I think their subs are the cat's meow. I also think Uncle Sams has one of those, "don't you dare fix it if it ain't broke" recipes going on. But Cheba Hut gives those puppies a run for their money. It was sooooooo good. So good.   I love you, Cheba, you dirty little slut.

Oh my god...   I used to hate Chipotle. HATE! Hate. When asked why, I said, "Because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians." I thought the burritos were 90 percent rice, 10 percent goodness, even when I asked for light rice.   I was, as it turns out, save-ably stupid. Because redemption is mine every time I eat here.   They get it. They "Get It" get it. They GET IT with a capital GET IT.   Oh, I shall explain. Worry ye not...   I want the world to stop eating meat. In fact, it is my destiny, my very purpose, to rid the world of Fear (i.e., meat). It's true, all you're eating when you're eating meat is fear. 98 percent of you will have no idea what I mean when I say that but I can promise you it's true.   But I don't want Chipotle to stop serving meat because people like you would stop going there and it'd go out of business and I would die because there would be nothing left for me to eat, because lately, it's all I eat. Yes. I ate twice today. Both times, Chipotle. If I lose weight, I'll become the next Jared. Gain. Ignominy. Whatevs...  It's delicious.  So here's what they get:   The freshest ingredients.  The meat, if you care, is straight up not injected with growth hormones or bull shit.   Portions are huge. Almost too big.   But the technology OOOOOHHHHHHH the technology!   Like Chuck R said... YOU CAN ORDER ON YOUR iPhone! It's ridiculous.  And our office orders as an office. ONLINE! Individually! Again, ridiculous! We can order exactly what we want, pay separately. The orders are prepared with love. They'll bring it out to your car. They'll even occasionally call you to make sure everything was amazing.   It was! It always is. I love you. Smooch.

This is a hippy dippy health food store.   If you care at all about what you put into your body, shop here.   If you prefer processed foods and the typical American diet, don't bother.   Prices are very reasonable. Selection is truly outstanding. Great book selection as well. They put on a radio show every weekday morning. The staff is mostly friendly and very knowledgeable.

Every Tuesday night after our late night hockey games, I join a rag tag collection of heroes, misfits and misanthropes at Four Peaks Brewery in North Scottsdale for some post game gab and nosh. I love these nights. We test our aging, yet surprisingly spry bodies mano-a-mano for adult hockey league glory and bond over drinks that no one actually orders because while Karina, our beloved server, may not know our last names, she knows we're predictable.  And speaking of it, I always order a plate of fries, or hope Brad E does. They're fucking delicious. T.A.S.T.Y. Big fan. But on this one lucky night, my boy Jerry W, genius that he is, orders nachos. I think nothing of it, until they arrive. They are GORGEOUS. Seriously beautiful. A culinary specimen clearly dispatched to our table by some immaculately conceived experiment working through the now divine hand of a short order cook. The guy, or lady, is a magician with these nachos. They're like eye-crack. Or better perhaps eye-(censored) as I visually molested each chip and chunk of cheese.  But like all impurities and roadblocks in our beautiful kingdom, like a cancer on the king's nose, these nachos were covered in chicken. I'm not even going to get into that discussion, but I don't do chicken. So I couldn't eat any of what I considered a plate of life-changing nachos, even before they changed my life. And I told myself "Dally G., no matter what happens tonight, whether it's because you go to the store and get the ingredients or because you go to Filibertos and get their supernachos, you're dumb ass is going to be chowin' down on delightfully tasty nachos this evening."  So here's one of the keys to the story. It was a done deal. I already believed with 100% certainty that I would be eating a plate of nachos that evening. Are you with me? A sure thing, no matter what. The universe had no choice but to comply. Emerson said it best, "The world makes way for a mo fo who knows where he's going."  But my friends didn't eat the whole plate. Nacho remnants teased me like those little shorts hot young women wear in the spring. I'm not gonna lie; more inspired to get fat I have never been.  Time passes and my thoughts stagnate (but without any of the negative connotation normally associated with the idea of stagnation). Nachos. Can't let it go...Men quip and pontificate and ask answers and tell questions and borrow my phone to look at (censored) and some hit on Karina but I am of one mind: Nachos.   And a woman's voice rings out! She was three words deep and I knew my life was changed forever. You, dear Yelper, should have chills right now. She said, and I quote, "Hey, the cook made these by accident. Does anyone want them?" I knew what they were without turning around but I had to look because my eyes compensate for my imperfect relationship with the universe and I needed to connect the truth in my soul to my physical experience that I call existence, living.  She sat down chickenless nachos right in front of me. They were free. For me. More beautiful than the first plate, they sparkled. CHEESE SPARKLED!  What does this mean? So what? Big deal. Total coincidence, right?  I know in my heart I connected with those nacho-potentialities and made them come to be as the beautiful plate that was placed before me... There's no question in my mind. Not even the faintest hint of doubt. And every day since, I've made small things happen. Am I able to win the lottery? No. I tried. But I didn't BELIEVE believe. I only wished and hoped and did what everyone else does. My skills are weak. It's very different knowing that the money is already mine, compared to knowing I'd have nachos. Winning the lottery is a huge and powerful experience that I'm not prepared for... Everyone asks me to will them their hearts' desires. It doesn't work like that... I don't care if you find your wallet (I do, but not like I need to)... You need to believe that you already have it and it will happen. You can literally have anything you want if it's mutually beneficial to you and the object's relationship to the world.  I know. This sounds like voodoo. Hocus pocus. The Secret. Whatever. It's crazy. I don't know it's true. I just feel it is with every ounce of passion and love and creative energy I've ever experienced... I share this experience primarily because I enjoy being made fun of but if even one person gives it a try and finds power in their life I've done a very good thing. Oh! and to remind everyone Four Peaks is life changing.

I've been meaning to write this review for a while... long overdue. Hopefully, Karma will not be too unkind for this oversight.   I wrote a review about my orthodontist that was presented at a national meeting of technology and orthodontia as the type of review you hope and dream about as an orthodontist... (True! - and you can go read it - Steig and Wachtell) because I basically said they were first class, top notch, and pathologically outstanding in every way. I also wrote that my hair stylist, AJ at the Roose - WHAT WHAT! was like the Edward Scissorhands of awesome sauce hair design. Got her some business. I hope this review conveys the same outsized, respectful admiration for Dr. Morris because I think just as highly of her.  While playing hockey, I took a slap shot to the foot, which I was sure broke the damned thing. I couldn't walk nor put even a hint of weight on it and was hobbling around in the most pathetic, ridiculous manner. In a style so utterly unmanly and full of emotional weakness I'm not even going to bother throwing in another sentence of descriptors to paint the picture. Top 5 least proud moments of my life.    I swallowed my pride and grandma's cough syrup and called their office based on Kevin H's recommendation above because he's someone I trust and they booked me for the next available appointment.   Just so happens, Dr. Morris is their foot and ankle specialist and she is legit. Let me, for a moment, digress. My dad, when I was young, taunted me with his skill with wood. So like, he made me stilts and weapons and hockey sticks, etc. Now, this was great, because he made me those things... but he was a total perfectionist, and it drove me up the mother-bleeping wall. I couldn't understand why anything had to be perfect, let alone everything. Wood, screws glue. Come on! So annoying when you're ten and have no patience. It wasn't until I read Steve Jobs for the second time and owned every Apple product on earth that I even began to understand what perfectionism is... It's the maker's love of the user. It has nothing to do with the product. It's the maker's expression of love for the end user. So, turns out, now, at 35 that my dad indeed loved me. Even when I was bratty and annoying. A remarkable discovery, to say the least.   Digression over. Back to Morris, MD. So, here's my thing about my experience there. She was thorough and, dare I say it, perfectionistic about my foot. I knew this because she thought about MY foot in a way even I hadn't comprehended in the previous 14 hours of excruciating pain. She's the embodiment of 10,000 hours of other people's feet, which in this case alone is a compliment. My foot/your foot is an extension of her. It occurred to me that she was like the Apple Inc. of my proverbial orthopedic eye, even though that analogy makes very little sense to anyone but me and may not even be an analogy at all.   Office staff was so nice. Jovanni, who helped me get around to get x-rays was super friendly. Cannot recommend Dr. Morris and staff enough. That said, I'm not recommending you get hurt. Just that if you do, go here.

I'm pretty sure I've figured the conundrum of My Florist out, because it is nothing if not a challenge to logical reasoning everywhere.    See if you agree...  People who rave about it - because you know they're out there, we've all heard them - live in places like Scottsdale, or Tempe, or Gilbert, or Mesa, or Peoria or CHANDLER. And they're woman of a certain age demographic. And they wear floral prints and drive a Lexus and have above average but spiritually empty occupations. They have a couple of kids who excel in school and play sports. For these wonderful women who I don't understand on any level, it's home. It's a place to go and eat the food they're supposed to be eating and drink the iced teas they're supposed to be drinking and talk about their lives and enjoy each other.   One recommendation. I hate hate hate valet parking. I HATE it so much. Once they broke my convertible top and additionally couldn't figure out how to drive my Prius. I won't turn over my keys to them. I park across the street. I do what I have to do. Get rid of it. Die die die...   So anyway, the food is blander than bland. The servers are friendly enough but it's always been slow in my experience. I just don't get it other than it fits exactly one demographic and they drag the rest of us there. I'm sorry if I've offended you with this analysis. But if the shoe fits.

Nothing could be more serious than what I'm about to say... Listen. Up.   We have been using another local print shop for several years that shall go unnamed because of how much I hate them. They're nice, talented people for the most part, especially Robert, but holy hell I don't understand how they stay in business. We used them despite them. In the most recent situation that draws my ever-loving ire, they sent us a half order and accused us of losing the other half. Then, we tried to switch over to Impact, who on two occasions ignored my requests for a quote. That was awesome.   So I begin to scour the Interwebs, high and lo, begging, praying, beseeching the Gods above for a printing company to just be effing awesome.   Lo and behold, such a company exists. The Heavens parted, angels sang to Odysseus' Sirens, and I found O'neil. O'neil is the real deal and if you don't get your stuff printed here you're evil. It doesn't matter if you've never heard of them. Even if you don't need stuff printed, you should make something up and send it here.   They're hyper local and by that I mean they're not only local but locally EMPLOYEE owned. Yeah boooooiiiii!  They've been in business for about 103 years or some crazy number to which I can hardly count. If you want to know the truth, I think in the future, I used a time machine to go back to the past to influence my future by founding this company that year just so that 100 years later I could look like a genius for finding such a great company to print our shite.   In case you need to visually verify the veracity of my claims, pull a Cosmo Kramer like I did and just bust down their front door. It's probably not locked though they claimed upon my departure there'd be a "Dallas G" policy.    I'm so happy. Even if they send me a box of flaming dog excrement they'll have done it with way more class, style, and responsiveness than the others in town.   O'Neil for President!

A vegetarian perspective:  Lo-lo's Chicky and Wafflin' is like your childhood. Think back to when the world was simple and everything made sense, even if the experience was new. Now we have global warming and a looming ice age and cheap gas and expensive wars and people just not getting along.    Lo-los is like "FUCK THAT... drink some cool-aid. But not the cult-spiked kind that will kill you" And you do. With good friends. Your very best friends. And they eat Mac and Cheese and the skin and legs of things that used to live. And you enjoy the conversation. The people around you say things like "You may not agree with National Socialism but at least it's an ethos!"  And you leave and there's a 1965 Pink Cadillac parked out side. And you think of what a DB Travis Barker is...   Additionally, the waffles are really good. Tasty, in fact.

I love the freakin' Bikini. The bartenders are fake-hateful/annoyed and completely awesome. The decor cannot be beat. The hipsters are but a mild annoyance blocking the view of the real attraction, and there's no kind sounding way to say this: the regulars who often appear to be roof-over-their-headly challenged.  The juke box, as pointed out by the New Times, is unbelievable. I rocked the house with $5 no thanks to any skill I have or taste in choosing music. It's just that well stocked with classics. Once at the bikini, a girl I'd literally just met moments before planted one on me without any permission or warning. Kinda hot. Kinda not. On the weekends, the DJ plays music I don't like but know I should, which means it's totally avant-garde. Alcohol is priced sublimely. I can get sideways on $20. Just kidding. I drink responsibly. Anyway, you haven't lived til you've walked into the bikini in an ironic mini. Or brown three piece.

So, guess what? I've discovered a major Yelp flaw.   I smacked a curb on my way to the mountain a few weeks back and turned the alignment of my car into the archetypal version of Kanye West's sense of propriety. BTW, He's just sad he lost his mama to plastic surgery. He's acting out. Back to me. I wasn't even on my phone. I just wasn't paying attention. Take away my license, Big Brother!  So I search Yelp for an automotive place that is clearly well vetted by the standard bearers of our little community, the Yelp Elite.   Quick note about Yelp Elite, since I count Abu J as my psychological consigliere. I don't really care if you're Elite or not when it comes to restaurant reviews. Everybody's got an opinion. But when it comes to places that can rape you prison style (think American History X), I want to know that the one review many of these places have is from someone other than their employees, and if you're Elite I've probably met you or read your stuff and it's probably a pretty decent bet that you don't work for the car repair place. Is that fair?   Well shit, people! They are so few and far between. Now, when you see the statistics about how much less of Yelp is restaurants than other business types it seems surprising because that's how I found it and that's what I love to review. But if you get your car repaired, write about it goddamnit. Jesus Christ I felt lost out in the cold. Ready for eternal slumber in the mouth of hypothermia.   So anyway, this place is great. I went on a Thursday but they said they needed four hours and I only had three. So I took it back the next day and they were awesome. Honest and all that jazz. I asked them to look into doing tune-up type stuff and they said it didn't need it. NICE!   I give four stars because they had my car ALL day and I was under the impression it was a four or so hour journey but I will still take my car back there again and again.   PEACE!

Check it out! The power of Yelp!   I got this message from a former coworker who read my Yelp on Facebook:   Hey Dallas - wanted to thank you for the Back to Basics reminder. Taking my car there rather than the dealership saved me almost a grand!  THAT'S what I'm talking about!!! My little words. A little reminder to someone about a solid little car shop and she saves $1000! F.T.W!

This place is so freaking good. I've only ever ordered one item and that's the veggie sub. Maybe sometime I'll try the cheese one but if it ain't broke... The mayo is the best I've ever had. I love their ice. Great ice.   The patio is misted. The decor is fun. Totally worth the drive if you're in a 7.5 mile range.

This falls into the something to do before you die category.   It's no longer called Joni's as Joni took off to run some other place. But the new owner's are awesome.   So, there's a short order cook there named Mary. Imagine if the Soup Nazi was a shorter, slightly older woman and secretly the sweetest person on Earth once you put in your six years as a state employee and got to know her.  And imagine she makes a breakfast burrito so good you spend $3700 and hours standing in the line to order it over the course of your six years there.   The breakfast burrito Mary makes is simply the best breakfast option in the state. No joke. I defy anyone to show me something better.   Go there some morning. Order the burrito. Friday's there's chorizo. Change your life. Don't be afraid. There's a whole unexplored world out there.   Tell her Dallas sent you and she may not yell at you for your shitty ordering technique.

Have you ever played that dumb drinking game "Never Have I Ever..."?  Now, when I play that game, and some dick wad says, "Never have I ever been poked by a dude..." well, guess who drinks now?! Or do I not drink? I can't remember how the game works.    Some asshole just walked by me at Lux with a goddamned bow tie. Man.  Anyway, I got both nostrils pierced because one time when I was 16 tender years old, this girl I had a crush on said off-handedly that Lenny Kravitz was the hottest man on Earth, so I studied him and saw that he was indeed a sexy bitch. So I sought for the next 17 years to emulate him.   First, when i was 16, I went and found the only man in Arizona that knew how to do dreads for the white folk among us because at the time he had beautiful flowing dreads. When you're trying to dread out your hair, you have two choices, tease it until you have full body chills from the pain, put wax in it, and pray. Or just don't shower. I took the first route and loved them with all my heart until they came out in the ocean about a week after I got them. The ocean is still on my "Fight on Sight" list.   Ok... did you know that Lenny even had his pubes dreaded at one point. Gooooooogle it. I didn't have the cojones hairs to pull that off.   Back to the story. He also had both nostrils pierced. This was a tougher sell. But after 17 years, I decided that's the only way I could ever live up to Lenny's legend in my own mind. So I went for a consultation. When I told people I got a consultation, they laughed like it's just such an easy decision that doesn't require any thought-inquiry. You know who didn't laugh? Those mother fuckers over at Halo. They were really helpful for about 45 minutes worth of questions.   Now, I don't know if you've ever noticed, but I'm really fucking good looking. A veritable Adonis. And so I was worried about scarring my near perfect countenance. So I decided to do it after speaking to the Halos. Halons? Halites?   So, Fate is ridiculously funny, and made my pet bird (Cotty, I love you!) attack my nose like the day after I decided to pierce it, after waiting for 17 years worrying about scarring. And now I have a scar on the bridge of my nose and two pierced nostrils, which I love soooooo much.   My friend Parisa said "Only Ana may poke me." This made me curious. Jeremiah, hopefully spelled like that, pierced me and it was superly duperly legit. Can't recommend him highly enough. Professional. Funny. Clean. Talented.   But he also said that I had to engrain on my subconscious that I had to sleep on my back with my hoop DEE hoop. And after about three weeks I started to get a little blastocarinostupidima bump. Inexplicably. So I went to see them again and this time I had Ana I she basically said, "My dick is bigger than yours. Shut the fuck up and listen. You're sleeping on your side you little maggot." All in a tough guy Australian accent. And I was forced to surrender the cool hoop for another stud and now i'm walking around with two studs and no hoop. Until it heals. Then I shall return and the hoop will reemerge victorious and I'll finally grow the balls to tell Ana what's up.   Until then, trust no one. Else.

This is the first day of my life I swear I was born right in the doorway (side door not front entrance) I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed They're making burritos within my reach  Yours is the first face that I saw I think I was bland before I met you Now I don't know where I am I don't know where I've been But I know where I want to go (Los Compadres)  And so I thought I'd let you know That lunch specials take a couple minutes I especially am slow But I realize that I need Los And I wondered if I could come home (side door not front entrance)  Remember the time you drove all night Just to feed me in the morning (two bean burritos with cheese) And I thought it was strange you said everything changed You felt as if you'd just woke up And you said "this is the first day of my life I'm glad I didn't die before I fed you But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you And I'd probably be happy"  So if you want to eat with me With this menu there's no telling We just have to wait and see But I'd rather be working for a paycheck Than waiting to win the lottery Besides maybe this time is different I mean I really think you like me When my face is stuffed full with a chimi

Love me some hidden house!   The music is too loud. The drinks too cheap. The clientele too local. But I've never had anything but a good time there. Whether it's karaoke or weird shit on the weekends you'll have fun if you don't expect it to be Merc, cuz Merc it ain't. And not for one moment in it's life has it pretended to be. But I love it for what it is and that's an experience.

I saw someone review Quiktrip recently and I'm like "What a loser." Who would review Quiktrip? A life? Better things to do? No?   Then my friend lost her job. I told her I'd buy her a drink. I'm very gesturally oriented. It's not the thought that counts. If the thoughts counted, I'd have given the biz to 13,000 women by now. It's the gesture. Especially if it could lead to a knob polishment for yours truly.   So we were driving by QT and I knew I could get off way cheaper here than Durants. So I'm like, "Whatever your heart desires, fellow loser who can't hold a job."   But while waiting for her to pick herself up off the floor (she slipped in her own salty tears), I noticed some incredible things.   Penis-sized cheese tacquitos!   My penis-sized mozzarella sticks. Significantly smaller and not quite as good but nevertheless satisfying to the undiscerning.   It was clean. It was dangerous. Some guy had to tell another guy in the parking lot "I'm not going to hit you." in order to approach.   And my friend paid because I "forgot my wallet" in the car.

I went there for breakfast and despite sitting on a park bench 100 feet away waiting for my friends I couldn't find the damn place. My fault, not the establishment's. I was greeted by someone at the door who immediately made the accusation, "Can I HELP you?" So I walked out and waited for my friends outside. The air conditioning wasn't working inside so it was a wash.   They arrived and we were immediately seated. I was told to order the coffee soda, which I obeyed due to my brilliance. Brilliance because that shit is gooooooood. I didn't like it as much when I put the cream in it though.   I appreciated that the server admitted to being hung over immediately upon her first visit to our table sort of warning us not to expect too much but she ended up being fine. But the same guy that accused me of needing help when I walked in also asked for our drink order in a very accusatory style. Something like you'd get at Fate.   After I had been eyeing it, my veteran Orange Table companion recommended I try the jalapeno pecan pancakes and I cemented my status as the world's premier recommendation-taker because after eating about half the plate and being too full to finish, I thought about that strange, beautiful combination of flavors the rest of the day. It's a little spicy so if you hate spice don't order it. Otherwise, it's fantastic.   My friend told me not to yelp this place after only one visit. She said it's such a cornucopia of experiences that this place bound to serve up in the future that I should yelp on the average rather than this one experience. But it was a good one, and I'll be back. Having owned an unsuccessful small business and having a roommate who owns a medium sized business, I can appreciate everything that it takes to make something work. Normally I'd complain about the air not working or the fucking weird dude working there who speaks in accusations but I could tell in the taste of food that this is someone's baby, which needs to be nurtured by the community and not nitpicked.

Amber W. dragged me here for her birthday. There are toplessish women.  Thanks Scottsdale ordinances! The Scottsdale City Council does not appreciate the value of unencumbered nipples. Or perhaps they understand all too well, which explains the ridiculous pasty rule. Anyway, the girls are toplessish, as I mentioned above. And that never hurt anyone.   $2 bills.

Let's talk about your last date. Was it dry? Too revealing? Sultry? Do you even remember it?   If you're anything like me, it was sweet. Really, really sweet. And yesterday no less!  But they all blend together. Those dates...  IN MY BLENDER!   Dates are nature's fuel. Chalk full of glucose, which is broken down with supreme ease by that tawdry liver you abuse with your binge, fringe weekends into the very usable glycogen. A solid glycogen supply is necessary... NO! Imperative, for sustained energy. You know, for your dates? Or the end of your dates, if you know what I mean, wink, wink, hubba, hubba...   Yikes. I'm that guy.   Anyway, dates have become a huge component of my diet recently and I was reminded by Mama G. that the Sphinx Date Ranch is just a grenade's throw away from her house in Old Town.   I stopped in to check it out yesterday and bought a 1lb bag of their jumbo varietal. Yep, I stole a wine word. From what I could discern, there are three date sizes and they're all priced accordingly, with jumbo being the most expensive. I bought those brilliant bastards, which don't taste any better but are more, well, shall we say jumbo(?) and moist and, I must say, simply amazing. If you're into this sort of thing, stop on by for shiz... They gots the goods...  But what if our date experiences came in sizes? Like you could buy a Jumbo blind date? He'd look like and act like this season's Bachelor or she'd have Mary's job and love of sports from There's Something about Mary fame. But if you're broke, you could just get the Medium Date with guys who are like me, only single. Dates should definitely be for sale. I'm starting a business. Done and done.  I hear the milkshakes are not subliminally sublime. Just, like, regularly sublime.

One of Phoenix Yelp's most famous Yelpers has an infamous father known affectionately by her and others as a peddler of bombast. In addition to balderdash, he sells one of a kind parts for a certain variety of entertainment devices. They're one of a kind because the devices are old and you can't get parts anywhere else North of 1969. His garage is probably the only place in the world where you can find some of these parts. He manufactures them himself. So he can charge a bloody fortune for them. Like, a fortune! The markup is in the thousands of percentage.   Enter Scottsdale plumbing. My mom had trouble turning down the hot water in her shower and being that I'm so handy, off to work I go...   The internal components were completely calcified and 30 years old. Needles to say, Ace Hardware doesn't have one of the necessary large-threaded attachments I need to complete the job. Neither does Lowes, where I was told "Sometimes you just have to call a plumber." I am a plumber, asshole. I rerouted the guest bathroom to two shower heads in the womb, biatch!   So I have to go to the famous Scottsdale Plumbing Co. I'm a bit of a femme, so every time I go into a place like this I throw on my Sportiqe apparel so they'll show me some goddamned respect. I would say that this was no different, though, to be fair, I didn't wear my tragically heterosexual deep V so we may never know. But they're definitely gruff, as expected.  So they gouge... Oh, sorry, I mean they sell me two parts I need. The part I bought that I couldn't find anywhere else was $70. S E V E N T Y dollars. I have worked at a machine shop. I know this is a $.70 part but because it's unavailable anywhere else, S$E$V$E$N$T$Y dollars. How they sleep at night...   Ok so in addition to this part, which I have no choice but to buy, they sell me the other part I need which is available at ACE. SPC charges $57 for this part. I bought it at ACE for about $35. I took it back to SPC and they were cool about the exchange. But damn!   So anyway, buy nothing but the very minimum of what you need there. I appreciate that they're there. I just wish they were a little less expensive.

Every Thursday night there's a live jazz ensemble. The singer, after paying a cover charge to hear him sing, will try to seduce your lady. The waitress will remember you every time from the one night you spent with her friend that blew you off because of her bf. Remember that night at BS West? But it's dark so you don't recognize her. And you'll ask if they have a full bar because it's dark and you can't see, but they do... And you'll wander into the cave in the back corner but it's reserved for a private party. Maybe you're a part of it. And the same friend will ask you to buy her a drink, like she does everywhere you see her. And you'll feel used and remind yourself to avoid her.

What is up with people who like Schlotzky's Deli? My family thinks it's good. That when you put their pizza or sandwich in your mouth, the experience is enjoyable. They are wrong. It's as far from enjoyable as I am from traditional. And even though they are wrong, it's all fine and good... except for those rare occasions when I don't have the choice about whether I am also forced to eat there, like birthdays. I don't want to throw my mom under the bus, because I can't even fathom what this says about her to the unknowing reader, but for her last b-day she wanted Schlotzsky's. I know. I know.   It's just so bad. What do you like? The sandwichs? That ridiculous bread? 30,000 cucumber slices? The pizza is so banal I can't even comprehend... Everyone likes artichoke hearts but it can't just be that on a veggie pizza. You must also include flavor.   But people like it! I do not get it on any level. I want to... I just don't.   I actively dislike writing bad reviews.

I can't afford the clothes here but that doesn't mean I don't shop here anyway. The cheapest pair of jeans I've ever purchased at Hub is $185. The money I spent on the most expensive pair could have fed an entire tsunami-destroyed village for a month. But, alas, I'm not a secular humanist. I'm a realist who really loves a nice pair of Diesels. And holy christ do they have them. Like no where else in Phoenix... they on the cutting edge of men's jeans. I took the knowledge that I swiped from Hub about the latest Diesels to the Diesel store in Vegas and they were asking me how I knew about certain brand new styles. I can't believe I don't know the sales dude's name by now (mostly because I'm too arrogant and self-absorbed to ask) but he knows his shit and is totally chill and doesn't try to pressure me too much because he knows I'll be back. Or Maybe just because he has a soul. Who knows!? I. LOVE. Hub.

Ok so here's my deal with Zipps on Camelback. Been there 1000 times. They have a great great veggie burger. Like, super tasty. Can't emphasize enough. But the last time I was there I had a really bad experience. My well-vodka soda tasted like it was poured in a poisoned glass. It was beyond gross. Undrinkable. I tried. My buddy had a well vodka cran. Same exact thing. Something was off. So after trying to choke it down I complained. I said, it's not a big deal. DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, but... it's gross. There is something wrong with something. So the fucking manager comes out and tells me that well vodka doesn't taste good. Thanks, Asshole. I drink well vodka ALL THE TIME and it doesn't taste like a chemical cocktail. So then he tells me that it comes out of his pay. Dude, are you serious right now? I just wanted a new fucking drink. Didn't want to enter psycho therapy with you. I'll pay for the drink. So now I don't want to go there anymore even though the food is really really good. Amazing. I'll probably go back but I hope the owner realizes his manager is Scottsdale's biggest tool.

I'm writing this review from my iPhone at the coach house. I'm taking yelping to a new interactive level.   This place is great. A lot of skeeziness. But it is the oldest commercial structure in Scottsdale. Every year around the holidays Santa C goes out of his way to throw up all over the joint. It takes them like 2 months to clean it up. The crowd is always a little older. The men's bathroom frequently smells, in a disgusting and charming way only possible in a dive bar. The bartenders are some of the nicest in town. As I'm writing, the bar keep is chasing a really drunk lady out to her car to make sure she doesn't wipe out a whole family or two.

Bartender: You're a DB. Be fucking nice. We tip you.   The food: $1,000,000.   The drinks: good enough.   The karaoke: rad.  The incredible variety of humans to watch while singing along: Priceless.

Anyone who knows me personally knows my life's philosophy is nachos. I call everything that happens nachos. Long story (See my Four Peaks Review for more info).   So I had a total nachos moment with the Dirty Dogg. I was driving around one day aimlessly as I'm wont to do and I think to myself, "Man, it's been way too long since I've seen a wet tshirt contest." I often have random thoughts about breasts. I like them. About two hours later, my buddy sends me a text saying "Dirty Dogg tonight, wet tshirt contest." Clearly, it was meant to be.  So I go, and it's my first time there, and I love it. It was a total sausage fest, as they say, and bikers no less. But still I saw the potential. It's really loud but it worked because bikers don't really need to speak to communicate. I assume. Even late-yuppie bikers. The bartenders are wearing too much for my taste, but I realize most people think they're appropriately attired or perhaps under-clothed. Still better than most. If I used phrases like "but-her-face" this would apply. Fortunately for my conscience, I don't. But they were totally cool.   The music, in my opinion, was a fantastic mix of rock and country and typical club rap songs. High energy. I knew all the words. I sang along in my most sensitive yet too cool to care way. Like, under my breath, but not. And then for the power lines, at the top of my lungs. "...took a midnight train going anywhere!!!"   The girls dancing on the bars were fun to watch. A lot of bending over and ass shaking that makes you ponder the perfection present in the bodies of such distinctly and uniquely shaped young women.   Drinks were fairly priced. Strong enough, and all that.   The wet tshirt contest was totally lame, I have to say. I think I had too much hope for it. The three ladies that participated were cute and wiggled and shimmied and shook all the right parts but I was just so "Eh." about it. The shirts they use need to change, immediately. They are white but you could just barely make out nipple. I think they're ribbed. It was a total disappointment. And they didn't get really crazy. Didn't show anything extra. Maybe due to liquor laws. I don't know. But it just left me wanting to balance my checkbook rather than what you can imagine I wanted to want to do...   So I went to Denny's across the street and told an incredible story to my friends. It wasn't the telling that was incredible. It was the story. Perhaps sometime I'll share it with you too, friend. Thanks for reading.

I thought I was sooooo clever writing about this place and being all useful but Max A. already beat me to the punch.   Shop here any time of the day or night for groceries and you will be assaulted with the highest concentration on eye candy in the known Phoenix-Metro area. It's better than the Safeway near ASU. It's completely rad. I've never successfully picked up a lady in a grocery store because, frankly, I don't look very wholesome and that's a place where it seems like you need to be to be successful, but if you're a guy in a suit or work out clothes going to or coming from the LA Fitness up the road you might have a chance.   It's usually clean and well stocked too, but who really cares, aren't most grocery stores?   Don't pretend like you don't like staring at hot people...

I had the eggplant parmisian sub thing. Holy god. I've only been there once and it was a long time ago but I remember thinking "Why am I such a super-human moron? Why don't I eat here regularly?"   Strangely, God responded. Some joke about me falling down the tree and hitting every branch. You know how it goes...   I did not experience the extreme wait times that other people mention but that would really annoy me depending on my mood. Yet another reminder I'm not self-actualized.

Update:   The temperature situation seems to have improved. I ate there the other day. Like, on site.  The best kept secret in the man-world: the women who work and dine here  are so bloody hot. If you're a straight male human, lonely, longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, eat here. Everyday. You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries.   Original review:   I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come true. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious.

Man oh man... I can't decide whether I want to review this place or not under the auspices of "if you don't have anything nice to say..."  All I have to say is this:   We ordered food. It came totally wrong. I asked for a vegan salad, not specifically, but that's how I ordered it, and it came with chicken and cheese. This just shows a complete inability to read the order. People make adjustments all the time. I have worked at a restaurant. I have fucked up. I should have been lashed 40 times! Read what people order!   So when I got the wrong salad and saw what an unbelievable disappointment it was going to be, I ordered a veggie sandwich instead, which, to their credit, they delivered and took off the bill.   The best customer service in the world could not overcome this sandwich. It was a monumental fucking embarrassment. I cannot believe they let that thing out the door. I ate it because I was starving but I would have liked to have driven it back there and go through it, ingredient by ingredient, with the preparer... Explain to me how this is appealing to the eyes, mouth, stomach, etc.  I just hated it. A lot.   Sorry, I'm sure you're nice people with good intentions.

This is my favorite fast food. I'm not sure if they consider themselves "fast food" but it's certainly not sit down. Honey tofu. Extra crispy. Large.

I'm straight. It's my cross to bear.   And as I texted my friend tonight, it takes a comfortable heterosexual male to venture to a gay bar alone. I go almost every Monday night. I love Bao the nail guy. God, I hope that's his name. I love the Martinis. Try the rose tea martini. Like nothing else.   Here's the most impressive part of Amsterdam for me personally. I have gone there regularly on Monday nights and a very occasional Friday or Saturday nights and I've never been hit on. Not one time. I attribute this to one of two potential reasons: I'm hideous and shouldn't venture out in public or these dudes have really good gaydar. Either way, I've never been uncomfortable there as an open-minded breeder. My friends are a different story.

This place is pretty amazing. Big fan of their bar and martinis. Like my women, I like my drinks strong. Self-assured. Forgiving. Powerful. I want to know who's boss. One sip of a dirty vodka martini and it becomes abundantly clear that person is not me. Because I love all things cheesy and forced, the outfits of the staff make me smile. Plus, the death of customer service in America has not yet infected the staff, who are frankly amazing.   The menu leaves a little to be desired from my perspective but what can I really expect going to a steak house. And all my friends think it's one of the best in town.   The only real drawback? No gangsters. I want to see real O.G.s conspiring in the corner.  But whatever. It's still a fun place to go after work.

So, I noticed that I gave Durants 4 stars. Huh?   WTF was I thinking? This is the universe's greatest bar/restaurant.   It's just so perfect. Pictures of dogs and bartenders who simply could not improve their game. Entrances where you shouldn't sneeze and exits into the gates of political hell. It's just so perfect.   My key board is now wet with the salty stains of my emotional discharge induced by the faintest ghost whiff of their dirty vodka martini. On the rocks.

Wow, people either love or hate this place. I'm a lover. I look for the best in things. Positive outlook. All that... If you go when they're super busy, which they often are, service isn't going to be the best you've ever had. But it's always been good. I went last week for a late lunch and the server and the Chef sat down at my table with me to discuss vegan options. It probably was the best service I've ever had. Three menu options you should try: the guac. Just try it. They queso fundido is probably my favorite menu item at any restaurant. I dream about it. And their jack-based sangria. Mmmmm. On busy nights be prepared to wait for a table. For a long time.

So, up until tonight, I've primarily used Yelp as a dating website. A girl thinks my picture is kinda cute. I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again.   So check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke...   I'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.    Ok, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the "cougars" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a "cougar" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000  Usually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've "evolved." If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle. I don't blame you. I feel dirty. But just a little. Mostly smug.

Vegetarians, take note:   This place makes me want to be exactly who I am... A judgmental, overbearing, discriminate, anti-carnivore.   The veggie burger here is simply divine. Get it with whatever you want.   Don't believe me?  You want a fried egg over easy on your burger. You go there, sister.   You want a solid gold amulet encrusted with emeralds on the side? They have that too...   Order the $2.50 red wine shallot reduction. Slather that shit on.  I like blue cheese. They give it to you in bricks on your burger. Bricks. Although last time I ordered it, Richard Z was so disgusted with me for doing so he wished e-coli on it/me.   Worth the cab ride to Mandalay.

Sometimes, I want to spend a lot on a drink.   Sometimes, I just want to stare at pretty people and people who are almost pretty but their parents looked too much alike.   Sometimes, I just want to feel like I don't belong without standing out.   Sometimes, I want to pee in a blue room.   Sometimes, the Arizona night sky is the most temperate and beautiful thing in the world.   Sometimes, I like big ass windows.   Sometimes, I want to chill before I go to Sky Bar to play with the 17 year olds.   Sometimes, when I get a wild hair, I go to AZ88.

So my bird wants to meet at Lee's yesterday for lunch. I've, as I was later reminded, heard of it before but I didn't remember that hearing event. So I'm going into this lunch blind knowing absolutely nothing about this place. And I get there and look at the picture of the vegetarian sandwich on the wall and it looks horrible. HORRIBLE! So I think to myself, if they're advertising something that looks that horrendously awful how good could the food be? So I'm there with my boy Richard Z and he's like "Dude, don't be stupid. The food here is good."  So I don't believe him. I say "This is suspect." So I text my bird who's driving there and I say, "Have you actually eaten here before? This place is suspect." Now, the Bird's having a bad day and she's like "*@*&#^&%$)@$#&*@#^*&@!!!" I respond "Ok, can't wait to see you, Suga." I was all smiles are charms yesterday.   So she gets there and I'm in such a good mood I can't even contain myself enough to order so she is forced to order for me and she orders me what she orders herself, which is a Tai tea with boba and an egg salad sammy. Despite my initial reservations I was pleasantly surprised. It was really freakin' good. Tai tea with boba was interesting. An aquired taste that I was able to aquire 3/4 of the way through.   So today, feeling less like a petulant child and more like a man. A man's man... I went back to get the actual sammy that I wanted yesterday but was too fricken angry to order. What, do you ask, drove me back the next day? The veggie avacado on a croisant. Other than the avacado being kinda gross, the sandwich was absolutely amazing. So I would recommend this place to my grandmother with a weak stomach. It's just really good. I'm sorry, dearest Lady, for my tresspasses.

I hike Squaw/Piestewa Peak pretty much every day because of abode proximity but I think Cholla trail is my favorite in the Valley. I hiked it today, in fact, with the notorious Amber W and Nathan S. Park on 64th St (Invergordon). Hike to the hike (10 mins from parking to hiking) and break some hearts with your sexy new legs, which this multi-difficulty level trail grants to the faithful. I'm the guy with the weighted vest that looks like a terrorist sport coat. I promise, they're just 3lb lead weights. The only TNT is my beating heart.   A hike to the halfway point is about 45 minutes for what I'm going to describe as the average person, even though I've met you and know instinctually you're most certainly not average. The second half of the hike is more challenging. Steep drop offs. Cliffs. Edges. And the like. Just use a modicum of caution and you'll be fine.   The best part though, is that you can easily sprint down the Cholla trail. Like, by sprint, I mean run as fast as you can. Book it. It's a freaking video game for your mind, body, soul triumvirate.   I don't like the Echo Canyon hike off Lincoln. It's steeper, less amazing scenery, and I just feel totally weird about it every time I do it. Like the mojo is bad. However, a hike to the top from either side is a wildly splendid view.   We live in one of the most amazing metro areas in the world. To have these hikes so available is just so lucky. Take advantage!

I have been there several times and enjoyed myself. Isn't that all we ever really want out of life? Enjoyment. But last night I went and had the calzone and it was amazing. The best thing I've ever had there. The patio is awesome. I love people watching at Cibo. My only complaint is the crepes. Everyone loves their crepes but I just think they're so blah. Crepes need to break your heart. Crepes needs to make you feel sick afterward. The whipped cream they use is pointless and watery. MAKE HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM! and if you do already make it better. And they should be just a little bit bigger. But overall, I would totally recommend this quaint little place for dates or work dinners. Just get dessert elsewhere.

I feel like I'm miles behind and miles ahead of the curve on Magnum.   Imagine a couple years ago, or last night, or whenever, and you're in bed with a girl, lady, woman, or victim du jour for the first time. And there's "hot and heavy" going on... which sounds noticeably less appealing when one is sober. And she tries to mount up for a "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man" ride and, maybe, you don't drink at the time, and you're like, "Woman, don't you have any condoms?"   And she says no. Things sour. You feel safe. And jackassoholic.   And you later find out this isn't true. SHE DID HAVE CONDOMS. It's just that she didn't want to embarrass you with the Magnum condoms in her bedside table that she shared with her tyrannosaurusly hung ex. What a Dick. Because she thinks you'd be intimidated. Because you're just a cute little guy.   Well, if you can believe it, it's happened to me. Again. And this time, her name is Magnum. She is beautiful.  In the future, the coolest of the cool, the swankiest of the wanks, the biggest smiles, the worst breath, the hippest hipsters, and the snobbiest Scottsdalians will disabuse this place of it's current location-induced obscurity. And I'll talk longingly about "back in the day, back in the days before you couldn't walk through it" like I do now with the Vig. This is the future of Phoenix nightlife. Are you marking my words?   The location absolutely could not be worse. But what they have is something really special. She has New York quality cocktails and obviously the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky phallic cigar aspect is an important factor that can't be ignored. Suck. Blow. Tons of cigars to be put wherever he/she will let you.   Go here. Be surprised. Tell your friends. Rinse. Repeat.

I mostly hate the college students that work there. I think for two reasons:  1) I'm jealous of some of them for being young and cool like I never was;  2) They're fucking arrogant assholes. Don't fucking look at me like that. Do you really think I'm going to steal this t-shirt, dirt bag? I don't care if you work here, you still look more sketchy than I do...  But I love AA. The company. It's awesome. The faux child porn ads are super sexy. The clothes are awesome. I wish I was skinnier to wear them better. The colors are amazing. I'm like a fish. I love shiny shit. I love short shorts. On girls more than my strangely shaped bod but I'll post a picture of me wearing some pretty tiny ones... I have a wholesale account as a t-shirt maker but the stuff I can't get wholesale always fun, though a little expensive.

I hike this almost every day. Obviously, I love it. I take no breaks. Prisoners, maybe.   Here's what you need to know:  Parking can be tricky. If you're going at peak times (get it?), the lot at the trail head is usually full and there's typically a line. It's funny how I'll hike with vigor but I hate walking to the hike. Anyway, it's the second lot you come to and the first on the left.   The hike gets harder the higher you get.   There's really very little danger of "falling off the mountain."  Plenty of spots to stop and rest.   Bring water. Summer or winter, the rescues are almost always someone who is not acclimated to the heat and thinks they can hike for just a bit. Don't do it.   Drink water before you go. The more the better.   I strongly recommend hiking boots, or just be super careful on the way down. It's super easy to roll an ankle.   You know when you get to the two metal hand bars YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!   Good luck and god speed!

The cheese plate is truly wonderful.   Beer and wine selection is plentiful and of high quality (I think, I don't really drink that shit).   The servers are hot.   The ambiance is very soothing, like the velvety wallpaper on the back wall of the cool front room (designyourwall.com).   This place is chalk full of urban professionals and bobos (bohemian bourgeois).   Everyone stares at you when you walk in and when you leave.    Have a happy hour here if you're into the company of other people who work for a living. Or bring a date on a Saturday eve after dinner.

I'm probably gonna regret this but the truth must be told. The. Truth. Must. Be. TOLD!  Let me start this very angry Yelp by saying I love Erenia and I hate doing this. I hate ripping on local businesses and I loathe it when I actually know and like the owners. In fact, in any other scenario, I'd just keep my trap shut. But this just rubbed me the wrong way.  Their product is of exceptionally high quality. I don't deny that and the stars are not about the quality of the food. They are good people with a great product and they deserve to succeed. I'm not trying to suggest otherwise. But...   Many people complain about not finding a seat. It is limited, which is part of the charm, if you're one of the Chosen Sitting Humans (CSH). I don't really mind standing so this isn't a huge issue for me.   What I do mind is businesses who CUT OFF THEIR NOSES TO SPITE THEIR CUSTOMER'S FACES!!!! Seriously, who do you think you are to be so obsessed with the idea of your own perfection that you are unwilling to make even the simplest of requested changes to the menu items? I just asked for no cheese!!!! This is not NYC and WE LIKE IT THAT WAY!   This is the first time this has ever happened to me and it will be the last at the Roosevelt! I'm done.    Do you know what you do when you employ such anti-customer service ploys? You screw yourselves because I walked right on out and I'm telling everyone who might ever go there about this personally and on Yelp. You screw the servers and make them look like complete assholes. WHAT DO YOU GAIN FROM THIS POLICY? You retain the intellectual integrity of a fricken salad? CONGRATS!   People have allergies! People have religious convictions! People are even sometimes horrified by the taste of arugula. The reasons the policy is absurd are too numerous to list. I hate it. I hate it fundamentally. I love you guys. I hope your restaurant flourishes but it will certainly not be because of me or my friends while I have any say over what we do on a given evening.   Or, just put a freaking vegan item on the menu. You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only vegan.

I love the mo-fo-ing Vig. This is my favorite place to go out. I don't like their food. Not enough vegetarian options. But who the hell cares? You can actually talk to people and not have to scream over the music. And when the music is loud on Friday and Saturday nights it's perfectly wonderful because the DJ knows his shit. The bartenders are very good. The servers are friendly enough that I don't want to kill them, which is saying something. I'm very angry about the death of customer service in the United States. People complain that it caters to pretty people but pretty is what pretty does. The fire pit is rad. Bocce ball. The location is between everything I love: the charm of downtown and the pomp and circumstance of old town. There's room for both in this man's heart. Plus, there's always a game or two on the tele and the prices are about right.  Any night out should be started here and if I had my way I'd probably end up there as well. Yeah. Can't wait for one to open downtown.

Douching is a mystery to me. I mean, what is it? How does it work? Would I like to help a woman do it? Would I want to associate with a woman who does it? Do all women do it? Is there a root cause? Is there a special syrup?  So I looked it up:  A douche is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself. Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douching - a bag for holding the fluid used in douching.  Now, to me, this sounds like a remarkable invention. But it's recently entered the moderm American lexicon as an insult typically directed at people like me.   Yep, I said it. I know many of you think I'm douchy. What you don't know is that I always wear a condom, so introducing a stream of fluid into the vagina for medical or hygienic reasons is just not something to which I aspire.  So who are these real-life douchers? I'll tell you. It's so easy.  It's the people who stand between the bar and the line of booths at the Vig. They're in the walkway, completely oblivious to everyone trying to make it from the bathroom to the patio and back. You, my friend, are a douche bag.   That said, everything else about the Vig is rad. It continues to be my favorite bar. The staff knows my drink. Love the patio. Best people watching in town. Sundays are so fun with the Daylons or whatever they're called. The music is always good, live or otherwise. The food has improved dramatically since my first review. Pam, the GM, is awesome.  I'm just a really, really big fan.

I love going out. One definition of an extrovert that I heard recently is that your batteries are recharged by being around other people. You don't need alone time. That's pretty much me. The idea that I just need to chill out and be by myself is a totally foreign concept. But I've heard enough people talk about it that it must be real.   So that said, you would think I would love this place. It offers the most Jack-rasses Scottsdale has to offer per square foot. Last time I was there, which was very recently, I played some crazy human tetris to get back to the bar to pay my tab. I bumped into 84 pairs of fake boobs, which is not really a complaint, 500 asses, of which only 321 were women, and I pretty much was sweating like a seagull on fire on the 4th of July, which ruined my perfectly coifed and excessively huge hair. I paid $20 to get in. I said "Twenty. Fucking. Dollars." You should have seen the look on the face of the money-taker. Apparently, she thought it was totally reasonable. $50 for 5 drinks. I didn't cuss at the bartender.   Now, it's not all bad. The burlesque dancers' asses are sublime. A true delight. Coconut creme pie for my eyes. Some super hot girl kept staring me down. I would have talked to her if not for the music that requires screaming over and the fact that it would have taken me 20 minutes to get to her and she probably would have been gone and the women I was there with probably would not have appreciated it. And the music wasn't bad.   That said, do your wallet, your senses, your sense of space, your intelligence, and your friends a favor and go somewhere else.

Wait wait wait... this place is still open? No, seriously? Um. I'm confused. No, I mean like, in business? Operating? A manager? Employees? Hours of operation? Transact monies? Uhhhhh. You sure? Because when you define "Air" as a smoker's patio and "Earth" as weird alien shit on the walls and "Fire" as the burning of your ear drums and "Water" as a place to buy really expensive drinks that dehydrate you, I just can't really comprehend how our $30k millionaire ballers can afford to keep this place going, even in an economic environment that protects only their class. But that's why I'm a $20k impoverished sycophantic parasite on our society. No business sense.   Two stars for the money they put into this place in the first place. And the elevator to the private VIP bullshit area. Classy. Retarded classiness.

Ok, I went back the next day and the very bartender who was so sullen the day before took me so completely by surprise with her insight into my emotional state of affairs that I almost gasped aloud.   I love yard house. They're basically accommodating of vegans. They once gave me a piece of chicken among my veggie pieces and no less than three managers came over to apologize. Good on them.   I wish the bartenders had ten percent more personality on average because I'm an extreme extrovert but I suspect the general public who they're meant to entertain are perfectly satisfied by their level of engagement.   Here's the deal, it's the best of the corporatey type places. Outstanding beer selection, stuff for veggies and vegans, at least in theory, and they want an excellent customer experience as evidenced by the two emails I received about my last review. Long live Yard House!

So, if you want to go out and be pretentious like I do and know you're in a really hip little place that few people outside of downtown know about, go to the Lost Leaf. I love the art.  Always very dark and brooding. Beer selection is amazing. I normally loathe beer. Lighting is usually excellent. I only get a few disappointed stares for being unironic. I'd love it if they had a full bar but whatever. I'll live and learn to drink a brewski from time to time. But, overall, it's a very cool place. Check it out. And if you love beer to begin with it's probably heaven.

Can you believe it? The ONLY bar I've ever been kicked out of...   I met up with some friends several years ago on Mill Ave. Ms. Personality, with her wiles, her charms, gets us in sans cover. Either that or she exchanged her brain at the door for the sake of me being able to share this story years in the future.   We get in, get drinks, and she starts dancing on the pole in the VIP area. Were I a bouncer of with decent business sensations vibrating around in my belly, I'd let a skinny blonde sorostitute dance on the pole with reckless abandon for the world to judge, but not this guy. He didn't like it one bit. So when he asks her politely to step down, he's rejected. When he grabs her she starts kicking and screaming and throwing haymakers at him like he's Richard Z.  Well, being a man of integrity. A man of grace... A man who believes chivalry will live as long as there's a heart beating properly in my chest, I fucking belly-laughed at the hilarity of the scene because I didn't really know, or care about what happened to, my new friend. Until they asked me if I was with her and if I'd step outside. Well, fine, I didn't want to be there anyway.   Part two of this saga and the reason for the four star review: Scandalesque performs there fairly regularly. To say that I have been over-exposed in my life is like saying Yelp is for people who like to write. I have seen a lot. Like, a lot. People with 20 years on me are probably reading this and laughing that I couldn't possibly have seen it all, and I hope I haven't, but damn. Life has some offerings and they are for sale... And they are free. And some can burn right into your psyche. So the fact that Scandalesque is so fucking sexy to me is amazing. The only thing that I can think of that easily tops it is A to the W.

Pretty much no shopping experience makes me as happy as going to Costco. Their pizza is reason enough not to jump. Big portions of life make me happy. I like the fact that it's membership only. Keeps the riff raff at bay. F-ing riff raff.   What is riff raff?   I can't think of one negative thing to say about except that the female employees don't seem to like being stared at by my weasely eyes. GOSH!

I'm giving these fucks the "I'm considering suing you" number of stars because they should not exist. Earth should not have companies like this...   I have a dishwasher. I am lucky. Some people don't have dishwashers. I feel for them, but only marginally more than I feel for me because my dishwasher doesn't really clean my dishes. If you are like me, you like clean dishes and want them cleaned between uses. Since mine isn't wonderful, I sought out the reasons for its clensatory ineptitude by personal inspection with my eyes and limbs. One possible cause: the soap dispensor doesn't latch.   Now you're probably thinking, this fucking guy, Dally G, I've heard stories about him. He probably roughly handles his dishwasher soap dispenser latch while it's in sleep mode. He may even have a sadistic impulse from time to time. He likes to see how much it'll take before its self-respect kicks in and it tells him to back off the back door. This is not the case. I am a gentleman and I DO NOT disrespect my soap dispenser. No means no. Consumate gentleman.   I have a home warranty. I am not lucky. Some people don't have home warranties. I don't feel for them. I feel for me, who has been relentlessly slapped around, swindled, disrespected, humiliated, spat and shat upon by mine.   Welcome to Protech Appliance Repair. That fucking guy. I don't actually possess the words that it would take to wholly and appropriately explain the boiling rage in my heart towards that coward-ass fuck. Retrospectively, it's my fault. The part is $65. His fee for telling my home warranty company my soap dispenser doesn't work because of reasons other than normal wear and tear: $65.    BUT WHAT. THE. FUCK? DO NOT. I REPEAT "DO NOT" allow your home warranty company to send this jack-fruited fuck ass prick to your home. The Devil's greatest trick was convincing your home warranty company you Bill Cosby-ed your dishwasher soap dispenser latch.

I have to be honest. I was reading the other BS reviews and I had no idea they served food. Where is the kitchen? I've been there 20 times. So take my review for what it's worth. Here's what Bar Smith is for me:  You meet a girl in Scottsdale. She's typical. So you're like, "Believe it or not, downtown is where it's at..." Girl's like "Really?" And then you wink at her really awkwardly and grab her by the hand and whisk her away to Bar Smith.   There she will see, in no particular order, members of the Latino community, mohawked audio visual specialists, a little guitar hero on the projector, people dancing in the middle of a watching circle, me in the corner crying, lesbians, women who are engaged who let me hit on them in front of their fiances without telling me they're engaged (apparently, little known fact, I'm supposed to look for a ring on some finger - whatever, too much work), and some dude name Bill Smith. I think his name is Bill. He introduced himself to me one time and in my head I'm like, "Dude, why are you introducing yourself to me at a bar at 1:00 AM using your whole name???" It occurred to me later the bar is his name sake and I bet he gets laid because of it from time to time.  Good for him. Fun place.   I wish I knew they had food.

Reasonable people can agree to disagree.   I consider myself reasonable.  Two weeks ago, I started a Facebook group called Save Palatte.   I created it to encourage/beg  the wonderful owners of Palatte, Ed and Christine, to switch from the current counter service system to table service.   Since then I've heard from many in the foodie community that agree.  I've also learned about Ed and Christine's hopes of having a welcoming neighborhood place to relax at over a leisurely meal.  I respect that.  And, given the timing, the first beautiful Sunday morning of May, I figured it was time to give it another try. Pam, a close friend, and I met underneath the Palatte sign at 11:30am. After synchronizing our watches, we negotiated the busy, but not overly crowded patio with relative easy.  We crossed the tread worn steps and pulled open the door to reveal, as we had expected and feared, a line of magnificent proportion.   I sighed, certain my hedonistic Sunday morning had been ruined.  Pam, the more perseverant of the two, pressed on through the adjacent rooms, into the Willows where the line's long tail tapered to an end.   Distracted by small talk and my comely companion, I was surprised to find the line, lengthy though it was, moved relatively quickly.   Half-way to the counter, our order was taken by an apron clad staff member.  I choose the Potato Mishmash and a Bloody Mary.  Pam, apparently willing to sacrifice to keep her yogi suppleness, opted for the yogurt and coffee.  We were handed our ticket and instructed to hand it in at the register.  Five minutes later, I obediently did as I was told, while Pam sought a table. Buoyed by the relatively painless ordering process, it only took 15 minutes, I joined my ginger haired accomplice.  She had secured a prime location under an umbrella in the front corner.  Where, to my ambivalence, I found her surrounded by the previous party's dirty dishes.  A small price to pay for such choice digs, I told myself.  Pam assured me the waiter/busboy would, he had assured her, return to clean up.  And so he did.  However, while the plates and cups were taken, the table, dirty and smeared with the morning's offerings wasn't wiped down.  No problem I told myself, confident it would be cleaned when new silverware, water, and our drinks arrived.  But that didn't happen, at least not for a full 23 minutes. I have been told, and believe, the rationale for counter service, lies in the unfortunately small kitchen.   Seating people immediately, so it goes, would result in the false promise of a short wait.  I get it.  And, after the increased efficiency of the newly reordered ordering process, I was willing to cut them some slack.  But, after 38 minutes, 23 of which were spent at a dirty table, something had to give.  And, so it did, kind of.   At 12:08pm, my Bloody Mary arrived.  Halleluiah!  God, my god, the one who drinks on Sundays in lieu of going to church, smiled on me.  However, my health nut, confederate was not so lucky.  It wasn't until 12:14pm, after personally trekking to the indoor coffee bar was I rewarded with a mug and instructions how to use the outdoor thermos. Like a Neanderthal dragging a mastodon steak, I returned to the table, caffeine in hand.  A toast was in order.  Surely, our vittles had to be close.   Not so.  It wasn't until 12:27pm, 57 minutes after arriving, 42 minutes after ordering that we received our food.   The Potato Mishmash was as good as ever, quite an accomplishment since it sat upon a still dirty table.  We ate in silence and thirst.  We never did get water.   Afterward, there was no after brunch lingering as I had hoped.  My short-lived buzz and limited patience had worn off.  With little fan fare we got up and left. As, perhaps, I've alluded, I'm torn when it comes to Palatte.  I love Ed, Christine and the whole bunch of bohemian henchmen.   I love that, like Cibo, Palatte is a local joint.  I love the food and ambience.  I want it to flourish and be the kind of place in which I, as a patron, can have part ownership.   That said, it kills me to go there.  I share the vision of a neighborhood hangout.  But can someone really hang out where drink orders are mismanaged, tables aren't bused and diners left to fend for themselves.   Call me nave, but I hope believe table service would cure a lot of what ails Palatte.  Admittedly, table service comes with its own baggage.  But, in the end, I'd prefer knowing one person was solely responsible for my happiness.   That it was in someone's economic self interest (i.e. tips) to make sure my table was clean, and my order not lost on the kitchen floor.   It's appropriate, that Pam accompanied me to brunch.  My ex-girlfriend, I've often wondered what life would be like if only something had been different.  I can't help but feel the same way about Palatte. Help save Palatte.  Join Save Palatte and ask for dedicated servers and table service: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?

Thursday nights, after 11:00, it's the place to be. IMHO.

I like eating alone. Love it. Why? Two reasons: I'm an only child and I can appreciate, sometimes, a solitary existence, and two, because I can have whatever I want. What do I want when I want what I want? In n Out. Those crazy religious zealouts have a menu even a vegetarian like me can feel embarrassed that my mouth is watering for...   What do I get? Same thing every time: Grilled cheese and Animal fries and a small drink. How much is it? $6.43. How much do I love it? THIS MUCH!!! What are animal fries? They're these beautiful, cheese covered, sauced enriched sliced potato children. Good god.

Full disclosure: I might be working at the bar in the near future so 1) come say hi 2) assume what you will about my motivations.   That said, completely coincidentally, I ate there twice yesterday. For lunch I had the black bean hummus and veggie sandwich, which were both excellent. For dinner the veggie enchiladas. Also very good. The horchata milkshake is unbelievably delicious. Really really freakin' good.   The information above is for those of you who care about the quality of the food, etc. But I'm the guy who cares more about the quality of the experience. Call me crazy. So my yelp-style recommendation is to think of it as the place to go during the week if you work or live anywhere near (30 mile radius) Central Ave downtown for a delicious lunch in a cool atmosphere or for happy hour and dinner in an even cooler atmosphere because the lighting/building/pool/ambiance really pops as the sun goes down. Great place for dates. If only I could trick a woman into going out with me...   I was the co-producer of a mid-size (150 humans from planet Earth) soiree hosted at the hotel last year and we timed perfectly the arrival of our guests with the graceful egress of our sun and many of the attendees attributed the beauty of the scene with the brilliance of the production rather than the normal rotation of the Earth around the sun. But whatever the reason, they loved it.   But the BEST part... the pool is open to the public. Go use it. Not only is free and open to everyone, but they even provide towels and sunscreen (use it!) and you can eat and drink the Clarendon Kitchen's nosh and spirits and perhaps drink more and swim safely there, even ever so slightly tipsy, because the pool is not very deep. Not a recommendation. I'm just keeping it real.   Did I mention you can have drinks at the pool? And there are pool parties pretty much every Sat. and Sun...  So anyway, I want to work there because I love it. I think it's one of the coolest places in town. The food is very, very good. Drink anywhere on the property. Eat by the pool. Stare at the sky. Pontificate aloud to fellow swimmers. After this bloody hot summer when the rooftop happy hour re-opens enjoy the best views downtown has to offer that don't involve you sneaking into a high rise and picking the lock to the slanted roof you'll slide off of...

Ok, first off, I'm sure Michael S is a perfectly reasonable and accurate Yelper but the one star review he wrote below/above is from a different owner before it closed down and reopened with new ownership/management. So please don't judge them by that review.   First: the location. It's located near my home where no other pizza shops dare open shop. Yes!  It's just across the street from the Bikini. Can you hear the angels singing?   Second: been there twice now. First time had pizza crust (for vegan -ness) and fries and a bite of the veggie sub. All superb.   Today my boy Richard Z had the Monsoon, which they're soon to be famous for (it looked amazing) and I had the vegan version of their veggie sub, which was outstanding. Really, really good.    They're super nice people. Charming little place. Place to sit outside and watch the culture.   They'll walk your food over to the bikini.   Open til 9 on weeknights and 11 on weekends.   LOVE THIS PLACE! So happy it's in my hood.

On an escapade of incongruous inconsistencies, I couldn't help but notice the Vegan Donuts! sign. What's this, you little player placater winking sparkly-eyed at my inner beer-bellied eight year old self? Asidely, I looked like an emaciated, doe-eyed African child in the suburbs of 85028. Though I was also caucasian as a child, if you can wrap your noggin around that little factoid.   So I ventured a vulture's wing span and hopped a frog over to Conspire to save my very life. My. Very. Life.  I died when the Vegan Donuts were gone for the day. I RESURRECTED with Mary in cave three days later when I bought their chocolate chip and peanut butter veganookies. They're like cookies, only you have sex on the bottom of them and eat the top when you're done. SO good.  I veganed out my sugary coconut latte thingymobobber and felt inherently morally and cosmically justified when I took it to 905 and didn't buy any of their evil beverages.   I love this place. FIVE Star make-out session with the doorknob when they're closed.

So I've heard about these other Yelpers having lunch and dinner meetings with everyone's favorite local celeb, Gabi K... And I was always a little jealous. And I was always a little suspicious. But it turns out it happens. She's a real doll. Not The Real Doll. Just like, a really genuine human. We accidentally met at an event this morning hosted by one of my new favorite people Christina P... and to make a really long story average in length, I loved it. The vibe is great. The place is cute. My iced mocha was tasty tasty. The wrap I had was totally delicious. I'm sure it's fantastic at night. They have outdoor air conditioning. How cool but what a waste... You know, like a hummer. :-) And the have Coca lite and I didn't even try it and the owner was very cool. I will totally be back for an evening of romancing and bromancing I'm sure.   Anyway, it's a really cool joint. I highly recommend it.

When I was 28 years old, I started drinking alcohol. I'm now 30. Before I started drinking, I had a certain amount of knowledge about the world. Let's say, for example, I had accumulated 28 knowledge points. A mere two years later, I would say I'm at 56 knowledge points. I have learned much more about life than I would have ever predicted. I've gained 700 Facebook friends. I've garnered stories that would make a porn star, new to the industry, of course, blush. It's difficult to shock the DV/DA-hardened veterans (physically impossible btw - if you have video to prove otherwise, I'll pay to see it). I've punished my body with 10 day benders. I've had the shakes from withdrawal. I've known two consecutive sun rises and sun sets with no sleep. A navy seal, I am not. A grizzled drinking veteran, yeah, a little bit. Abu J, I know you're gonna call me a light-weight. I grant you, there is always more to learn. My parents generously endowed me with a hardy appetite for rock superstardom, but selfishly withheld the genes for a functioning musical ear and a giant member. Thanks for nothin, mama.   (Interesting side note - one of my ex gf's thinks my mom and I are in love. This comes from a woman who communicates with her mom once a fiscal quarter.)  But then Andrew K was in my car one day and he INSISTED we listen to the country station. And a song came on by Phil McGraw... Yup, Dr. Phil.    I think Ill take a moment, celebrate my age The ending of an era and the turning of a page Now its time to focus in on where I go from here Lord have mercy on my next thirty years  Hey my next thirty years Im gonna have some fun Try to forget about all the crazy things Ive done Maybe now Ive conquered all my adolescent fears And Ill do it better in my next thirty years  My next thirty years Im gonna settle all the scores Cry a little less, laugh a little more Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear Figure out just what Im doing here In my next thirty years  Oh my next thirty years, Im gonna watch my weight Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers Maybe Ill remember my next thirty years  My next thirty years will be the best years of my life Raise a little family and hang out with my wife Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years In my next thirty years  This song struck me. Right in the baby maker. What a fucking loser I have become...   I have in many ways downgraded the parts of my humanity that society values. I was productive in my past life. Had a solid career path. A brilliant, ridiculously talented woman loved me. With visceral fortitude, I have displaced entirely the concept of self-discipline. Of a work ethic. The desire to work just a little harder than the schmuck next to me... No, not you Z. But in other ways I love who I've become. I'm charming. I'm easy, whatever you want to take that to mean. I don't judge anyone for anything, except my exes, who I seem incapable of forgiving (just kidding Amber). I find it incomprehensibly energizing to meet new people. On many levels, if I weren't me, I would at least want to be my friend. That's how much I like who I've become.   So the point of all this... You had to know I would get there eventually, is that I need to find a balance. A balance between where I've been, where I am and where I see myself going.   Whole Foods is that answer. It is THE answer. They have the right products for me to learn to be a better human. A balanced carbon-based humanoid. They have shampoo that makes my scalp tingle. Soap that makes my privates tingle (BUY IT). They have food that makes my tongue tingle.   One area that I'm really focusing on right now is my diet. According to the enneagram, I'm an average 7, which is an excessive hedonist. And I've totally been a pig of the epicurean sty... I was an unrepentant glutton. The only thing that kept me under 220 lbs was vanity. Even as a vegetarian. But I've always known, in my little ticker, that I should live as cruelty-free as possible. So, one area I'm implementing discipline is in the diet sector by becoming a vegan. Unfortunately, the selection at WF is so good, I don't even have to employ any discipline. I can eat the same shit I've always eaten and it's delicious and no poor creature had to suffer for it. Life is almost too good. How did this happen?  I could go on. This place rules. I love it so much. Like the love affair I'm having with my mom.

Really good. I'm writing from the table. Full as the day is long. Hot girl in the movie on the screen. Music could stay or go... If I lived within 30 miles of this place I'd be back all the time.

I love this place. I wish they had dinner hours. It's a little loud. But other than that, it's by far my favorite place to eat lunch in the heart of downtown. It's so consistently good. I believe it's family-owned and as such nothing has changed in years, which is a wonderful thing. I highly recommend the Vodka and the Fiorentina and the mushroom-sauced daily special when they have it. And the manicotti. And the calzone. Oh, you dirty little calzone... It is what it is and what it is is sooooo good.

I've been several times now and I feel like it has so much potential and so little self-actualization.   First, let me say I was a former small business owner and I can appreciate how challenging it is... I don't want to rip on anybody's livelihood. I'm sure the best of intentions are all there and they will make this into a very cool place.   That said, what the fuck is up with the serivce? The dude at the counter (I've been there several times but this story may as well be true for any of the visits) was totally friendly. No complaints about him. But why on Earth did I ever have to interact with him when there appears to be a server serving the patio? Except, she wouldn't look at or speak to us. We were there for over an hour, the first half of which was spent waiting for her to notice we were there (we were one of two groups on the patio). Being ignored sucks. I'd rather be discriminated against because at least they acknowledge your existence.   The location is cool but the parking is not fun. The decor is fantastic. Big fan.   I really wish they would improve the service. I'll probably give this place one more shot.

I would contend to you, dearest Yelper, that I date attractive women. Or at least they're attractive to me. That's the important part, right?   But that doesn't mean that when I go out with them I always want to be able to see them... or worse yet have them see what I'm doing... And who knows what I'm doing when I'm there because I can't see the hand in front of my face. LOVE that...   The music always gets me grooving in my chair and I'm going to say something politically incorrect. I always feel cooler when I'm hanging out with African Americans. They just give off a cooler than cool vibe. I keep inviting my Afro-American roommate out to whatever and he's always like "Naahh Dude, you're too white." I get it. But I'll break him down eventually. Little does he know I'm Mongolian.   So anyway, it's a little difficult to order a drink and always crowded but overall I love it. Bring your stuck up yuppie friends. Smack their skinny asses with the iron hand of culture. They'll thank you tomorrow.

A fine establishment I suppose, but the least good for after hockey booze, in my opinion. If you're just a normal not hockey person, and you like neighborhood bars generally, you'll like this place just fine.

So I'm retransitioning to veganism (read Skinny Bitch/Skinny Bastard for more info) and I wouldn't say this is a vegan friendly place in any way.   But I tried the salad with tomatos, feta, pecans, and green leafy substance and it was really, really, really tasty. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Poor Richard Z. did not have the same luck with his beef sandwich thing.   When I ordered it the owner said it was the best decision I've ever made. Well, I don't know about that... But it was certainly a very good one. He's also gave us a free Red Bull cola, which on its own merits is eh, but I very much appreciated the gesture. Cool guy.   Overall, if you want to support a small business with very tasty salads, and you're near Chandler Blvd and the 101, and you don't mind that there wasn't a single female customer in the joint, this is definitely a place to consider.

Oh Hell yes! This place doesn't fuck around. I assume it's authentic Italian food but I've been to Italy, technically a couple of times, and I never experienced anything this good there except for a $6 scoop of double dark chocolate ice cream in some famous Roman square.   The food is simply amazing. Three words: Eggplant! That said, your experience is dependent on your ability to engage the owner. He's rad. Magnetic. Talented. Funny. So if you have even a modicum of grace and social disineptness or adeptness you'll do fine. If I was the type of person to do lunches, dinners, or generally engage others in a mutually beneficial exchange of thoughts or ideas, I'd be here all the time.

I feel like I'm Eminem coming out of the funk of two years of a drug addled depressive yet transformative roller coaster.   Man, what a wild ride. Everything is a process. But my head is clear and this is a Yelp that's been demanding to be written for a while.  Yesterday, Amber W tweeted something very insightful. She basically said, I can't believe in the year 2010 or whatever year this is people still 1) smoke 2) believe in God in the traditional judeo christian sense 3) eat meat. Now I can imagine someone who does all three, or hell, any of the three, must believe that Amber and I and our cohort are pretty fucking stupid to think that any of those things are going away. For you, Sir, for you, Madam, I just hope you live long enough to see it because it's coming and true morality, true Golden Rule style living, will rear it's pretty little head.   Sasha is someone who could give Damon B of Green fame a run for his money. She's creative. She's talented. Everything is delicious. There's no titanium disulphide in my food. It's fresh. Sometimes it's raw. It's local. It's largely organic. Did I mention it's delicious. She's experimental. She's kind. She's generous. She's all the things that we look for in a leader of the righteous food movement. BTW, there's no way she'd endorse that statement. That's all me.   I get the vegan delight pizza. I get the masala burger. I often get the specials. The fruit smoothies are the best you will ever have. Seriously. Do something you can feel good about. Support this local business putting out the very best product at a very fair price... I promise you will not be disappointed no matter what your thoughts are on vegetarianism or vegan living.

This is my new favorite bar.   The decor is awesome. They have rad-ass performers. So rad, in fact, that my Bird's parents now know she's gay because the Lounge singer used a gaydar machine on her and it went off the charts.   But let's talk about the important stuff.   $1 jello slime shots. Enough vodka to give you smell-chills and cheap enough to not be too upset about throwing it all up later.   They have Absolut Peppar. This is important to me as I like my dirty vodka martinis spicy. The spicier the better.   You simply must check this place out. I think I'm going to try to get my next birthday party scheduled here.

I can't believe I've never thought to write about this place before. D'Lisa is the best! The best. She rips the hair from my body like a champ. Like she hates hair in a really loving way.   It hurts quite badly. But others report the pain goes away after time. But it looks so nice. And all the girls want to see it. And one time, when I got it done my friends pulled down my pants and blasted my special purpose with one of those 20,000 watt bulbs and took a picture so all you see is a bright bright light emanating from my junk. My very valuable junk.   And in a moment of reckless self promotion I can subtly hint that she sells my original tshirt designs there. And they do hair and what not. Go there. Give her some business. Not the business.

I wanted so badly to hate this place. You have no idea.   And this doesn't come from a place of hate in my heart. I don't hate "Scottsdale." The concept. The place. Or the people.  Ani Di Franco says "If I were you, you're exactly who I'd be..."  So if I was both a city and an undeniable DB (which are equally possible coexisting phenomena considering my paunch and treatment of other humans at large), I could indeed be Scottsdale. I could represent everything about it.   But instead, some rich ladies and gentlemen, developers and career hype-hawkers no doubt, decided to build a representation on Camelback Rd so I could go on just being me, Dally G. Scottlas, Atlas' retard cousin, I am not. No, I did not just use that word.    But, as I said, I don't hate it. I do hate hype. I do hate, kind of with all my heart, the fucking dumb asses who stand in line for video game systems,  Starwars movies, and iPhones. So the 2000+ people who showed up at the pool at the W this weekend are the unjustifiably more socially acceptable versions of the 3 week line-standing uberdorks. I know I'm making a lot of friends here.    So when I arrived at Sushi Roku for a "press junket," I was like, I already hate this place. Just because I'm a judgmental asshole. And I wasn't greeted by a TOTAL FUCKING TOOL. By that I mean, some fucking asshole in a horrible, horrible tie who later introduced himself as an assistant GM, would not fucking acknowledge my presence as I'm leaning on the podium. Dude, the people at the front are more important than the famous chefs and stingray skin place settings! Get a fucking clue douche-nozzle! ARG! It wasn't until the main attraction arrived and took the bull by the horns that we were able to break into his extraordinarily minuscule external sphere of recognition or comprehension.   Ok, so I have no idea what a press junket is... But I'm calling it that because it makes me sound like a pimp. And I need more of that in my life. But it was a night for press people from around town to come and check it out and get everything comped and interact superficially because they all seem to hate/judge each other. Who can blame them, really.   And it was fucking marvelous. I loved the place. As a vegetarian on a meaty night, they hooked my skanky ass up. I had a breath-taking eggplant dish. Some tofu variety platter that would probably be about $15 I imagine, which was good but I would have to know the price before I could recommend it. I had a mushroom tofu steak and a fairly delish dessert. It was all very good. The seaweed salad was good but loud. Yes, very loud in my head. Our waiter, while it seemed that he had never worked in the service industry before, was genuinely nice and totally helpful with my surely annoying veggieness.   We got a pseudo sneak peek of the pool area during a party that was going on. I didn't quite understand why it was so hush hush when there was already a huge party going on but whatever. The place is fucking rad. Bring a date there. Expect him/her to put out. Not because he'll/she'll feel obligated but because everything is sexier there. It's just totally amazing.   The people walking around the rest property were as snobby as you'd expect and yes, they are judging you. But everyone should check this place out once.   I guess this is sort of a review of my experience at the W as well. You'll probably live. Check it out.

I love Sens. So. So. Much.   One of the wait staff offered to stalk me. I told her I live two blocks away.  Surprise me.   The Hot and Dirty is Arizona's best cocktail. Hands fucking down.   The tofu is simply amazing. Wasabi. Make sure you get the first bite.   I like the blue lighting under the bar. Reminds me of the florescent lights I want to put under my Prius.   I'm a wham bam thank you ma'am kinda guy but that bathroom ALMOST makes me want to make sweet sweet love.   Mr. Chu is the man. I love that he loves his creation so much.

Mojo, you know I love you, but I hope you're listening.   This place has some non-fruit flavored non-dairy fro-yo. And it's delicious. Like, totally delicious. Darn good topping selection.   Yogurt Builderz has a neighborhood feel contrasted with Mojo's art/deco-ness. Thank goodness, there's room for everyone in this fro-yo woah ho.   And there it is, one of the things I believe, a little fro-yo life lesson, that there is enough of everything for everyone. The universe provides.

I'm a pretty big fan. There are still a couple issues to work out but they're not anything I really care about so... yeah.   Basically, I love the design or the architecture or both. Not sure which is which. But it's rad.   If Sens' bathroom makes me feel a little amorous, I've probably touched myself in a Hanny's bathroom. Probably. Beautiful.   Todd and Jason are great bartenders.   I like the martini concept they have going. $5 for vodka. Yes, please.

Have you ever grown intellectually without really being able to explain why? Like, you're sitting in your car listening to a CD you've heard 100 times before but this time you really listen and all of a sudden you find your shirt is tear spackled and your left and right ventricles and probably also your right atrium feel like they're twice the size from just 10 minutes before and the additional centimeter diameter expansion is not enough to make up for the disparity in the intensity of the beating.   Or you read a book in high school honors English and wrote what your teacher described as the "perfect five paragraph essay" on its themes and then read it again years later, only to discover that you were ONLY a really good regurgitator of others' opinions but that now you finally can internalize the meanings because of your experiences over the last 13 years.   Welcome to Sidebar, the Greatest Lounge in Phoenix.   The movies, bartenders, color schemes, imbibers, music, and lighting make this place a real contender. There is a bit of PHX douchebagginess that is very, very different than Scottsdale douchbachery but overall the place is rad. And my socks, one fateful evening, almost perfectly matched the ottoman.

The Lodge is the book whose cover is judged and who surprises you by killing off Old Yeller. Like, in a to-put-him-out-of-his-misery sort of way. God I cried so hard.   I love the Lodge in the same way you'll find thematic love in all of my Yelps. I do a lot of hmmming and haaaaing and mostly apologizing for the DBs of the world. You know who you are and you definitely don't read my Yelps. Or at all. So it's like we're talking about them behind their back in plain view. I have no issue with this genre of human. But some do. So I like to point it out when necessary.   How many places have I said, "Just pretend like they're corroded batteries and you can't touch them or you'll get an acid peel"??? Or maybe you're into that. I really don't judge.   To wit, a phrase for which the meaning is completely lost on me, I will offer that I love the Lodge, a food and beverage establishment located in Scottsdale, AZ even though it is full of Scottsdalians, who are like reptilians, but worse. Now, my mom is a Scottsdalian, and not a reptilian (that I know of) but she doesn't go to the Lodge. She's never been. So for this Yelp, at least, I'm safe.   Now back to book covers. This place is dressed up like a log cabin. Quaint, with the stuffed animals and stuffy Russian business men hitting on my girlfriend. You, sir, may be able to buy me and sell me figuratively, but literally neither I nor she is for sale! You see that exclamation point? I mean business.   The veggie burger is outstanding. The fries delicious. The bartenders are the smartest in town. You can have an indepth convo with them and they are ON THE BALL!  The drinks are not outrageously priced at all. I would go so far as to say very reasonably priced. Seating, standing, getting carded can get a little hairy/confusing but overall this place is great.

I'm a jack vegan. Well, that's not fair. Most days I do it right.   So everybody seems to think I'd love this place. LIke I SHOULD, for some reason, like it.   I HATE IT SO MUCH. SO SO MUCH.   There's nothing wrong with it unless you want your food to taste good. But if you're one of those morons who are into that, there's a little problem with Pita Jungle. Same with Schlotzky's. Everyone seems to like it. I have never had anything there that tastes good. But many wonderful people feel differently. I can't explain it but thank god for diversity in the universe.

Richard Z's faux Dallas G review is brilliant. I reward mediocrity if their heart is in the right place. But I knew what I was getting into by going here for lunch. Chipotle. Same story. Rice. THE BURRITO IS ALL RICE. I asked for just a little and I still had a rice burrito. Many of you are saying, but you're a vegan. What do expect? Well, beans, guacamole, tomatoes, pico, salsa, hot sauce, onions... A vegan burrito could be amazing. What I had was white rice. In a tortilla.   For me one star, but I am biased by their meat centric business model. The restaurant was full. People must like it. Two stars.

I had some sort of grilled cheese with three sauces. I enjoyed it immensely.   The location is great. They're gonna kill it because nothing is really around there that can compete.   I hate the bathroom doors. HUMAN FACTORS people. Human factors.   Will I be there very often? No. Is it a decent place that's going to attract a lot of yuppie duchebachery? Yes. But I'll play along.

This four star review surprises no one more than the author. I have railed and rallied publicly against this over-priced Pink Berry knock off for months. Mostly because the East Coast Snob likes it so much... If she liked my mom, I'd find away to get unadopted. Or emancipated. Yes, even at 30 years old.   But the darnedest thing happened on the way to Vegan Forum...   I was at the Biltmore the other day trying to buy the above mentioned totally beloved mama (who Georgie has never met, thank god) an iPhone 3GS, because God knows she's suffering through each day with a slow ass 3G in excruciating complacency, and what popped up and tripped me but one of those ridiculous Mojo chairs. As if by magic. And so, taking it as a sign from the nacho gods (see my review on Four Peaks), I went in to see if they had vegan yogurt.   Never in 1,000,000 years would I have tried the non-dairy fruit flavor that they had before I boldly blossomed into the incredibly sensitive, sexy vegan you see before you. But I tried it. You know, to prove a point to myself and, more importantly, to my angsty heart. With pie crust crumbles or some such nonsense as the 24 karat topping.   Divine. It was horrifyingly delicious. I was so annoyed at how good it was... Now I know it exists. Now I'll be tempted. Now I can't berate Georgie on Twitter or Yelp anymore, which is the biggest tragedy of them all...   Now I only pulled the lever down for a second and a half because it apparently costs more per ounce than platinum, but on this day, that day, it was worth it.

I'm giving you five stars because I love you. And I truly think you deserve it.   But it's early. I'm tired. I just ordered a coffee and two of my four modifiers were wrong. ICED? Check. BLACK? Check. LARGE? What the hell is this puny little bastard? FRENCH VANILLA? There were no pumps of anything in there.   Your coffee is the best. At least to me. But when I'm thinking about waking up and getting it the night before and the morning comes and I'm totally disappointed, it's such a challenge to pull myself from this mood.   Did you hear that Starbucks just implemented a rule that the baristas can't make more than two drinks at once? It's because we're only human and we fuck shit up. Sure, there was a line, but it wasn't out the door. Just relax and listen to the order. Repeat it back. Only work on, at max, two things at once.   I would have just said something but I knew I would be rude and I didn't want to be mean so I just kept my mouth shut.   Anyway, I read some of your others reviews and I don't think a lot of people are being fair. For the space, I think your choices for healthy foods are inspired. They are the right combination of appeal to the masses and appeal to the hippies.   All I want is a really big coffee. 32 fluid ounces. Please. It's important that it's right. If I want a shitty, expensive drink I can go across the street to *$.

Georgie S likes Mojo. That's because Georgie S is an elitist East Coast snob.  Yogurtland is where it's at. Flavors as far as the eye can see. A sea of tangy, tarty goodness. Like the first day of fall semester at ASU when all the women wear tank tops and short shorts.   Twice as good as Mojo and half the price. Math is not my strongest subject but ratios and charts would undoubtedly point to Yogurtland's radness and Mojo's unremarkability. Ordinariness.

Ok... I feel like my relationship with The Parlor has been pretty fucked up from the start. It happens.  I read a bunch (what felt like thousands of five star reviews) and so I took a really good friend there before she moved away. We had a nice time. I had some issues with the beer temperature and the very friendly but inconsistently available servers. I thought my food, while very tasty, was poorly portioned. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I feel like I had a three star experience.   I subsequently revisited The Parlor because while I don't think it's the second coming as many of my very good friends do, it's still a very cool place to grab a beer and bite.   Totally by random coincidence, on one of those subsequent visits, I happened to check my email and I had a Yelp PM from someone who pretty harshly critiqued my Parlor critique. Which is fine, except I felt like he was taking it REALLY personally so I assumed he worked there. Now, since I post my picture and I asked and he confirmed (and then later denied) he worked there, I was a little worried that my future visits could be problematic. So I took to the streets with my concerns and by that I mean the Yelp talk threads. I created a talk thread as an open letter to the owners/managers that I was concerned about this situation. I have since been informed he was let go from his position there, which I applaud hugely. I think they must have some really smart people working there who get the power of Yelp, even though most deny it, and who get customer service.   Which makes the following scenario hard for me to digest.   I was there with a group of 8 or 9 friends a couple weeks ago. We had a lovely time. Brad E spilled his beer on me. I drank it off the table. We took pictures in the chair near the bathrooms. All was good.   So at the end our evening, my portion of the bill was about $36 with tip. I had all twenty dollar bills on me and needed a little change. So I walked up to the bartender, who appeared morally strained by working on a Saturday night. Out of the 8 or 9 people with me, at least four of us commented at different times about how he was hating life. I gave him a $20. I had a second $20 in my hand. My buddy also gave him a $20. So he got our changed and walked back and gave my buddy his change and then took my second $20, which I stupidly laid on the bar, and gave me three $5s and five $1s. I didn't immediately notice the error, because let's face it, I split a pitcher. But I immediately did notice that I walked to the bar with two $20s and got back to my seat with three $5s and five $1s. So I start looking everywhere for my second $20. Pants no. Floor no. Replayed the events in my head, ahhhhh! So I walked up to him and said, "Dude, I'm pretty sure I gave you two $20s..." He basically just said no you didn't and walked off. So I approach the hostess and tell her the scenario and she took my number and told me that they would call me at the end of the night about whether there was an extra $20 in the drawer.   There was never a call. The hostess was totally cool about it. I don't blame her at all. The bartender was a TOTAL FUCKING JACKASS. All night and especially when this happened. I have bartended in the recent past and know that everyone has bad days (I have been the subject of a less than kind yelp about my bartending prowess). He just didn't want to be there. It's cool. I get it. I'm not saying he stole the money by any stretch. I missed the mistake at first, too. But if someone, even someone who shared a pitcher, came to me and sincerely said "Hey, I think I might have given you a $20 before and a $20 after the change" I'd think long and hard about whether that could be true. Because in this case, IT WAS.   So I'll be staying the fuck away and imploring my friends too as well because I feel it's cosmically just.  Though, if you don't know me and don't care about justice in the universe and are just looking for a hip place to go for dinner and you're in the Biltmore area give it a shot. I doubt my misfortune will happen to you.

I have some good stories that happened in the drink line here. Stories. Plural. Someday, I'll update my review and tell them.   Until then, the drinks are SOOOOOOOOOOOO expensive.

So. Hula's Modern Tiki...   I was at Hula's MT the night I met Porn Star Ron Jeremy.  I was at Hula's MT the night I found out how to forgive a family member for murdering their lesbian lover in their sleep in Nebraska.   I was at Hula's MT the really inspiring time I heard that song from the movie Rad, Send Me an Angel (by Real Life, 1989).   I was at Hula's MT the time I witnessed a family of four drink 5 Volcano bowls.   I've written there.   I've been cold.   Hot.   I've seen Keely there probably 100 times.   I've ordered things not on the menu and found no phlegmy aftertaste.   I've had a birthday party there.  I've been to a birthday party there. I fell into a wall after leaving there.   I've had caffeinated beer there. I've had un(not de)caffeinated beer there.  I've found it to be delicious and drunk.   Get the black been burger. You're welcome.   Get the Scorpion Bowl. Don't drink and drive. Do have a pulled back hair holder.

Welcome to Part II of Dallas G's Improving My Life series.  You may recall in Part I of Improving My Life I reviewed Whole Foods. I talked about how I stopped drinking (haven't had a drink in over a month, which means my Yelps will no longer be funny) and switched from a vegetarian diet to vegan, which is going on about 2 months. I'm even considering a raw food diet. We'll see.   In Part II, I'm going to be ridiculously effusive about Amen and the Amenzone Primal Workout.   The deal with human fitness, at least for me, is that you don't realize how far you've let yourself go until you start working out rigorously and discover through pain, but hopefully not injury (be careful!), that you're not 18 anymore. Like many of you, I have several extra ELL BEE ESS's. I'm not obese, but I'm not the lean specimen of lady lust induction I'd like to be... In fact, my problem has been that my life was too good living with a mediocre body. My bird likes a man with a belly. And I still manage to have many wonderful friends despite my paunch. I AM FORTUNE'S FOOL!   But I realize I'd be happier if I LOVED how I look naked. My sizable head could swell even larger. And most importantly I know I'd feel better because I've been in really good shape once before and it's amazing.   So here's the meat:  Amen is a HIGHLY charismatic, energetic gentleman who is the creator and 5:30 AM inspiration for me and about 15-30 others of a "primal" workout that involves no weights, no machines, and no B.S.   We use old tires. We use our bodies. Sandbags. It's intense. It's draining. It's honestly the greatest way you can possibly start your day. Almost every day of the week he offers some kind of training. There is now primal yoga. There are high intensity before and after lunch sessions. You can hire him for some one on one brutality. He has trained professional athletes and yet he's not gonna make you feel like an asshole if you can't physically do something.   The first session is free. it's $20 for a drop in and if you buy a package it's about $15. So what's your health worth? I highly suggest you check it out. During my first session I had to quit with ten minutes left. It's seriously intense. I've since been able to finish but it's still as challenging as the first time. I've just learned to pace myself. If you are totally out of shape and haven't worked out in years I suggest talking to him about easing your way back into it.   Seriously, try this. Thank me later.

Rachel, our server, is a historian. And she's historically accurate, which is to say, she's the reason we now dine here on the blood of enemies after our hockey games instead of Four Peaks.   Pete, one of the other servers, accused her faking the other reviews about this place for her benefit. Well, it's true, I am Rachel and I have obtained Elite status as Richard Z, Brad E and Dallas G For the purpose of self promoting. It's taken me two years but it was well worth it.   Meanwhile, the veggie burger is good, the onion rings are as well, and the wii and the $60,000 live action video game system make me stay for more abuse from Richie Z. Brad E beat me really hard in a sword fight last week as well.     It's good. If you're here, eat here.

The world is in the midst of a spiritual awakening. An awareness and movement toward a higher path is afoot. Can you feel it? I realize I sound crazy. But I truly believe this is true with every fiber of my being.   Part of this journey is a back to basics approach to our lives. A reconnection with nature and peaceful living. That said:  This is more of a product review but, from what I can tell, this is their main product for sale so I feel like it's fair.   Yesterday, I bought some life changers. I bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers barefooting shoes.   OMG  They come from a company that has for years made rubber soles for other shoe brands. This is their first complete product and it's totally amazing.   It's essentially a glove for your feet. It's the closest thing you're going to get to barefoot with protection from heat and sharps.   I got them yesterday and immediately hiked Piestewa Peak. All of my attention-whoring desires were fulfilled by the 20 people who either stared at me like I was Gollum or who stopped me to ask about where to get them. But more importantly they were awesome to hike with... I was like a full on monkey using my toes like they were meant to be used. I did stub a toe, which probably wouldn't have hurt as badly with regular shoes, but I stepped on sharp rocks with all my weight with no pain whatsoever.   Do yourself a huge favor and at least go try these on. We were born barefoot and I doubt our genetics anticipated dress shoes or high heels.

OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH YEAH!   Love me some Roose!   Pronounced "Ruse" but it's just off of Roosevelt. Pretty cute huh?   AJ is the stylist. LeAnne takes care of your skin and non-top of the head hair.   AJ, who's been cutting my hair for a couple years, is incredible. Each year one stylist from OUR WHOLE WONDERFUL COUNTRY is chosen to represent THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA in an huge hair show in France. A couple years ago, AJ was that person. She's really quite talented. Like Edward Scissor hands, but female and not sporting severe social anxiety disorder. And her skin is radiant and not ghostly white. And her hair is not jet black. Ohh, and her hands are not knives! But other than that, she's exactly like Edward Scissor hands, sculpting works of art out of shapeless masses.   I have not had the pleasure of LeAnne's services yet but she's uber professional. I'm quite satisfied to believe that when she waxes the hair eloquently away from your skin it will hurt less than when others do it.   Go here. Live it. Love it. It's the real dealio...

This review is a two with a burning desire for five...  I want this place to succeed like I want a million bucks.   I have never operated a food-providing establishment but I suspect it's quite difficult.   But I've consumed a lot of food and beverage.   My recommendation to this sweet little Pomegranate Cafe is don't skimp on the ingredients. I haven't eaten there but I had a spicy chai. One of my favorite places in town is called Sens and they have a drink called the Hot and Dirty. This drink takes a sledge hammer and hits you in the chest. Then it spits on you and its friends are dragging him away because they hear cop sirens in the distance. I don't even know if I like the taste or not but the experience is so powerful it is literally "an experience" to drink it.   The way you described your drink and the way it came to me was abortive. I mean that in a "trying to be helpful way." Sincerely.   Punch me in the face with this supposed spicy cayenne. I know, you said it's a hint. But I'm a man. Subtly is dust in the wind.   Be better. I'll be back. Please try this place. I want it to win.   One final thing. Get new lids IMMEDIATELY. First sip soaked me and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt.

I'd say, must try before you die. I liked it at the time. Did it completely silently and blacked out (lid closed). However, I had fucked up hips for two days after. I think i must have tensed up without knowing it. I'm sure it's gets better during the second float but I don't know that I'd ever be interested in the second float. I did it to force myself to meditate. There must be better ways.

If you have ever read a single word I've written and didn't believe it, now is time to start.   These guys changed my life. I cannot express that with enough emphasis. They literally changed my life.   You know that thing about you that you can't really shake the feeling of hating? Hopefully most of you don't have it but I suspect a lot of people do... You know, you're like, god, I'm so awesome except for this one little thing. I hated my teeth for years. Like, hated. Hated smiling. Hated pictures. Hated hated hated. They weren't even that horrible but I'm such a teeth snob about women I was sure there was no way anyone could find me attractive with my two stragglers.   And then in my LATE teens my parents agreed to pay for braces. Greatest blessing of my life.   So we went to three or four consultations and the orthodontists performed various tests and we received quotes that ranged from $10,000 to $40,000. Most of them said I would need surgery to fix my alignment issues. Most importantly we just didn't click with any of the docs.   So we got a referral to Drs. Steig and Wachtel and the stars, in fact, aligned. They were the least expensive and offered the most logically sound solution. No crazy jaw realignment surgeries. No craziness at all. I seriously could not recommend them more.   Everyone in their office is super friendly. They walk you through the process. Answer all your questions. I'm not sure if they still do it (I'm assuming they do) but they used to work out a payment plan. Seriously top notch in every way. The joy that I experienced after my braces came off was almost inspiring enough to make me want to become an orthodontist. It brought me more joy than any other event or series of events that have ever occurred in my life.   When all was said and done, I felt like a new human. They told me later that they took my original impressions to their industry night where they talk about tough cases. Their colleagues all agreed I needed surgery. And then they busted out my final impressions gansta style and blew away their colleagues with the course of treatment. These guys are brilliant.   If you don't like your teeth, you will after the guys get done with you.

The Vig bribes me to write 5 star reviews... There, I said it. I'm a fraud.   They bribe me with all kinds of shit. They bribe me with the best manager in town. *Thomas S is also amazing but he knows that...* Seriously, Pam is amazing. They are so lucky to have her.   Tucker, the owner, bribed me by singing the sweetest sound I've ever heard: My name. He thanked me for being loyal. For being a fan of their brand. He explained their thoughts as they developed the place. Cool guy. Amazing spot.   They bribe me with delicious food and beverage. Sure, I have to pay for it but, when it's this good, it feels free.   They bribe me with douchebaggery. The people here are so full of themselves, AND I LOVE IT! When I was a younger man, I wanted to see and be seen. When I'm older, I'll want the same. But right now I'm cool to watch. Mostly, you guys are douche bags. It's true. But it's not a bad thing. You look good. You have nice cars. Own it.    They bribe me with "scene"... I always. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I'M. THERE. KNOW. I'm in the right place. No place in town I'd rather be...   They bribe me with lighting only "the gays" could appreciate. I'm gay, so it's ok.   They bribe me with Bocce ball. I win. I lose. it's fun.   Amber W is super mad at me for writing this review after only one visit. But I know the Vig. Uptown. Arcadia. Whatever. It's the place to be.

I had a nongoing feud with Lucky Strike. That is, they didn't really know about it until about a year later but, on Facebook, I tried to dissuade people from going there because of their policy denying fashion defining jorts (mens jeans shorts).   That said, Gabi and Jared invited us for a bowl/drink and all was forgiven when you go somewhere (ANYWHERE) with Royalty.   I got so sloppy drunk. Gabi says we're serious bowlers, and while that may be true in the most proudly white trash sense, that night I could not see straight. Nor bowl. Jared likely benzodiazepined me.   I would describe Lucky Strike like this: Scottsdale type crowd, very reasonably priced drinks, and very, very expensive bowling.

So......... Here's my annoyance: I like this place for a number of reasons. Yes, that's part if the annoyance. 1) A one or so-time porn star works here. Trust me. Long story. 2) it's close to my house. 3) hummus is so very good.   But I go at 8 pm and they're like, oh, it's been dead all night we're closing early. Normally, they close at 9. That shit pisses me the fuck off. So I go to Stingray instead for a seaweed salad, which was, of course, good.   So I walk by at 9 and they're still serving others! Whatthehizzle?  The bartenders are all female and they're all charming in their own way. Kind of too cool for school and kinda stay at home mom-ish. Did I mention the hummus is soooooooo good?   I like this place but I don't appreciate inconsistency of message or treatment of patrons.

Ok, so Jessica has seen me naked more than any other woman who has never slept with me (except probably my mom and that one babysitter) and she's yet to laugh. I don't know if she bites the inside of her cheeks or secretly wears flaggelatory under armor that is so painful no laugh is possible... But she just waxes and spray tans away. Did I mention I'm hermaphroditic, which is embarrassing but a real thing I'm dealing with. And Jessica just applies pressure and love and she tells me story of youth's lost innocence and I tell her stories of philandering hermaphs and we laugh and laugh and the cows come right home. She told me that it's only because of my duel genitalia that she's willing to wax me because of the curiosity deep within her (nothing about that last part is true).   I am rocking one of her spray tans RIGHT NOW (I'm at the uptown vig on Oct. 3 2013) and people keep just not understanding what is so different about me. It's a glow from heaven. Or rather JT Aesthetics.   SCHEDULE NOW... don't forget to exfoliate.

I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha.   There are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence...   Take a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like "I feel..." and "When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton..."  Order the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort?   If you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed.

I've been to the Crescent Ballroom a couple times but I've only seen one show. Let me tell you how it played out... and therefore why you should go.   Through my typical dumb luck, which I am blessed to have in spades, I was able to get tickets to a show on this particular night that I needed them.   I showed up late and what do you know, I walked down and took someone's seat in the front row.   The singer, a blonde woman, age unknown, is like "I'm gonna free style. I hope you don't mind." So, of course, the crowd goes wild without knowing what's coming.   And she starts sing a Toby Lightman song:  "Did I see you winkin' or is that me thinkin'?  Should I show affection to the guy in the front row?  Did I see you smile 'cause you been here for a while  Should I make a connection with the guy in the front row?   "But you don't know where I'm from, where I belong All you know is my name And you only know what you see and that really isn't me But I'm glad you came  DALLAS here again interrupting my own story:  Now I'm thinking, is this a coincidence or am I the guy in the front row? Cause, you know, I'm the fricken guy in the front row.   Ok back to the story:  Her still singing...  "Are you makin' passes while I'm pleasin' the masses?  Well, I know all about you, you're the guy in the front row  AND THEN I SWEAR SHE LOOKS AT ME! WINKS. SHE WINKS! I of course am bright red and embarrassed.   "Are you trying to distract me, while you're tying to attract me? But I what to do, about you in the front row"  OK... So here's the part you're all hoping for... my emotional devastation.   She finishes the song in which she say's she's glad "I" came... Asks lyrically if "I" want to hang... and at the end... She's like come here, guy in the front row.   She wags her finger in the exact way you want a relatively attractive woman to wag her finger and I get up... and she bursts out laughing hysterically... and she can't stop. She's like dying of laughter. That fucking bitch is crying laughing at the stage and everyone saw me get up... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.   She was fricking wagging her damned finger at the guy next to me... who like got up and smelled her knee. I'm sure she would have made out with him but she was still laughing.   So anyway, if you want THAT kind of relationship with the artists. That's what you get. you can like see their cloven hooves if they're devil women like her. Or whatever.   It's quite literally the best place in town to see a show or be the show and get seen or watch trendy people in their natural habitat.

To all of you who didn't give this place five stars, I imagine you'll never do anything of note with your lives. And I don't say that in a small way. I think that there is obviously the magic of love here and since you can't see it, it will always be the missing ingredient in everything you ever do.   Sure, the hours are not posted or stuck to and there's no signage and there are other issues. The music can get loud. The lighting is dark. wah!  I keep forgetting to get the owner's name but this is very clearly a person living her passion, using her bountiful skills, and trying to make the world better. That's worth celebrating even if the food was shitty. But it's so far from that...   The food is spicy as fuck. But it's way tastier than it is spicy. And the ambiance is awesome. And that couch. Oh the couch. And the lighting. In the tables. I'm such a sucker for that shit. And the water is delicious. The only improvement would be booze.   Support a local business owner who's giving everything and more to make this work.

This Yelp stresses me out to no end.   So I have a long history of having Johnny's place being my go to place. I cannot tell you how many people I took to Sens. I literally believe it was in the 100s. I tried to start every night there when I was living downtown and most nights ended there.   Then I moved to Midtown and had a regular bird and we would do date night there but it just wasn't the same in terms of frequency.   Then came ASU and downtown changed and they fucked up his street and he'd had his eye on the new spot that is now Sochu House for a while and the stars aligned and he moved. And I moved back downtown literally a mile from Sochu House.   Dallas G - The Hot and Dirty Life, Redux, or so I thought. I was so hopeful.   And so I started going there at least once a weekend and it felt like old times with some of the old bartenders and the ever clever and interesting Johnny...   But, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, people started being honest with me. The problem is that I'm a vegan and I don't eat anything that comes from an animal. Like, if I know an animal molecule is in my food, I won't eat it.   And I found out there's fish sauce in the Papaya salad, which was one of my favorite things on Earth. And there's fish sauce in some of the sauces. So what used to be my favorite place on Earth became a source of stress and distrust.   So I had to stop eating there. But I still go for the drinks. Just not like I used to...   The food here, in my opinion, is so good. So so good. If you're don't care what died to feed you, I highly recommend this place. And if not, the drinks are super delicious.

Some people want more cowbell in their lives. They're stupid. What they really want but don't know they want is more Island Life Pools and Spas. Let me tell you a little bit about my experience with them.  Disclaimer: This was my experience. Yours may be different.    Alternative Disclaimer: I'm moving this week and, while I will no longer have my own pool, I'm considering hiring him anyway just to come stand around shirtless on my new balcony as a draw to bring the fly hunnies up to my place.   Second Alternative Disclaimer: Jealous husbands, I've never seen him be anything but uberly professional so don't sweat my jokes.   Ok, so, biweekly or monthly depending on my memory, Rod has saved my pool from being a swamp-thang by dealing with the many things regarding this pool about which I'm too incapable of learning and altogether too happy to pay him to deal with...   So he comes, and, this last week, knowing it was the week of the relationship that has gone on so long but not long enough in either my own or the pool's estimation, I heard through the open porch window that the pool was weeping hearty sobs and that there was a flower blooming out of the top step.   And I said, Pool, Dearest Pool, why oh why do you weep and from where and how did this little guy sprout, considering you're chlorinated and all... and the pool paused, and said it didn't know for sure but it did remember that one salty tear had fallen from Rod's eye that last day he loved the pool in the exact spot the little guy arose but that what was most sorrowful was that the pool saw its own pristine beauty reflected back in Rod's eyes and knew that era had come to an end.   So I did the only moral thing. I left Rod's card taped to the fridge and put a note telling the new owner that no one could ever love this pool they way he did. The way he probably always well if I know him at all.   So yes, the rates are rock solid and in line with the service you get. He'll come to you. You never need to haul your pool into him. He goes almost everywhere throughout the valley. He's reliable. He's knowledgable. He's a small business owner doing his thing and that's who we should be supporting, Yelp. In my opinion at least.   If you need pool help, this is your guy.

For those of you who've been traumatized by Protec Appliance Repair (die, literally, you fucking bastards, die - I mean that) like yours truly, finding a worthwhile appliance repair shop is no small matter. If my boy Eli H hadn't given these guys 5 stars I would have never trusted their five star status. Guilty by industrial association.   But I know Eli IRL and he's solid as a rock and a small biz owner and all around good guy. So I trusted his review and thank god for it. Appliance Works is not just a pun, it's a fact. They got out same day in a sort of emergency situation on my part because everything my wife commands is an immediate law of Dallasland (category 5 red alert situation). And she told me to get this shit taken care of...   Anyway. They were EARLY and FAIR and like, knew what the fuck they were doing. Like, how many people do you know who are absolutely terrible at their jobs? These guys dripped with competence.   So good for them and good for you if you call them.   I just bought www.protec_appliance_repair_is_a_scam.com

I am a Vig brand super fan. Great food. Drinks. People. So this breaks my heart.   The white trash-ass smoking allowed on the patio ruins this place. It occurs to me they might allow smoking on at the Arcadia Vig, which allows explains why I live at Uptown.   Smoking is so fucking gross. It makes your food gross. It makes your drinks gross. It makes the experience gross. For example, the smokers next to me are talking about how they pee between each others legs when one is sitting on the toilet and one is standing and also about how when her boyfriend recently inserted a tampon in her vagina, he asked where their relationship could go from there. I hope they're happy.   Also, I've now been here approaching 20 mother fucking minutes and have yet to be approached by an employee. Embarrassing.
