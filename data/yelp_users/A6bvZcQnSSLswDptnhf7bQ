All About Books & Comics...  You, I like.  Your staff is just helpful enough to say "Hey!" as I'm walking in the front door (or the back, as this godless Briton often does) but not so hell bent for sales that I can't get to the New Comics wall without a short, bushy-haired managerial figure latching himself to my leg and dry-humping with reckless abandon. (See: Atomic Comics in Mesa)  When you walk in the front door, it smells like comic books. Which is somehow appropriate, because AAB&C is one of those no-nonsense-type specialty retailers... like those stores you see in a strip mall in South Phoenix with the simple title of "GUNS". (What's next? A restaurant called "FOOD"? But I digest.)  At first glance, you might wonder what AAB&C has that other comic retailers don't. Frankly... as far as buying comics on a week-to-week basis goes... nothing, really. But when it comes to old comics, All About is all alone at the top of the heap.   You see, I haven't lived in AZ all my life... but someone was kind enough to inform me that in the 90's... All About wasn't just one store. They had a bajillion stores spread all across this absurdly large civic pitri dish we call Phoenix. But when the comic book crash happened in the late 90's or whatever... they narrowed down to just one location. So ALL of the old back issues from seven or so stores had to be put into one warehouse. Which is why if you ask for basically any old comic that isn't Action Comics #1... they'll have it.  The only complaint I can offer is the music selection. It's just so wimpy and non-committal. The classic rock station? REALLY? What's the matter? The Easy Listening station wasn't coming in clearly? What a bunch of girls. Not that I want to hear hardcore Gangsta Rap or Thrash Metal while I buy my X-Men comics or anything, but still...

I've had an increasingly bad experience with my comic shop of choice over the last several months (which you can read all about in my Atomic review, if you're that bored) and was told about this shop - which I'd never heard of before. It's in a comparatively small building, if some other valley comic chains are the standard, but what they lack in space, they make up for in good, knowledgable staff and a pretty decent amount of stuff. It's in sort of a bad neighborhood, sandwiched between the 'Gay' Denny's (Is there such a thing as a 'Straight' Denny's?) and a pretty good taco stand whose name escapes me.  If back issues are your thing, that's Samurai's achilles heel, and you may want to look elsewhere. Their back catalog just leaves a whole lot to be desired, but I've noticed that they frequently put their back issues on sale, so perhaps that is the culprit. I noticed that they have a few more graphic novels than other shops, too, and they sort them by publisher. (Barf)  I really like that they greet you when you come in, but don't hump your leg and try to hard-sell you things that you don't need or want like some of the other places in Phoenix. I recommend it to people who just want to pick up monthly titles or graphic novels, but definitely hit up All About or some such if you're looking for back issues.

This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark.   I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.  The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!

If you've ever asked yourself "Why do I shop at Bookman's, anyway?" then a quick trip over to Gamestop should clear matters up for you. I'll not mince words: this store is the size of a closet. Actually, my roommate's walk-in closet is slightly larger. I don't blame the employees for looking stressed-out and indifferent, I would be too if I had to sell overpriced games and ask every hispanic grandmother "Would you like an Edge card?"   The trade-in values are a laugh and a half. Seriously, just bring a few games in to hear what they're offering. It's better than Don Rickles.  "What's that? You want to trade in a game you bought for $60? I'll give you ten bucks for it."   The most abusable return policy EVER makes up for it, though. Buy ANY Used game, and you can return it for one of equal price, no questions asked... like, ever. Some people have been riding the same thirty dollars for years, I kid you not.   The staff are actually pretty good, with a few notable exceptions. Every manager I've ever met who works at this location has been the dictionary definition of douchebag. But usually the floor staff are helpful - if a little slow on the cash register - and they can always tell you plenty about upcoming releases and such.

It had been years since I'd had Charley's, and up until recently, I'd thought the only Charley's was across the street from Paradise Valley Mall.   Anywho, they're known for being the anti-Subway. If you want healthy food, go elsewhere. Preferably far away from me. Charley's brings the meat and cheese, and all of the accompanying grease and future heart trouble that accompanies it. Those like myself who possess the metabolism of a hummingbird on crystal meth will eat it all the same.   I have to confess to having only tried two of their sandwiches. I have a routine going whereby I resolve to 'try something new'.. only to be immediately distracted by how utterly delicious the Philly Cheese Steak looks and ultimately going with that.   One day I did manage to shake myself out of that beef-fueled stupor long enough to get their buffalo chicken sandwich and I must say.. it was absolutely delicious. They're just good on every level, if a bit pricey. Their fries, though, are nice and cheap. You can buy chicken bacon ranch fries (if that's your thing) for a little under 2 dollars.   The negative? Their drinks are microscopic. They might as well not even give you one. I've seen sippy cups larger than their 'regular' drinks. All the same, it really is surprising to see such a high quality sandwich shop inside Chris Town. Just one of many welcome surprises I discovered during my recent visit there.

This place is great. I've never been out to Tempe to see the mythical location they have out there, so I'll just have to go by what I see here. Some great, obscure stuff (usually only the Used stuff will actually surprise you) but the best part is the prices. Even on new stuff, the prices are really reasonable.   Easily my favourite thing they do is putting brand new releases on sale for $15 or even as low as $13 during the first week of their release. Many a rad album has been picked up during these sales, and every now and again, you can pick up a 'Used' (see: stolen from Wal-Mart and traded in by a crack-addicted hobo) copy of some of the newer albums. I can't think of anywhere else that you can pick up a used CD for as low as 3 bucks. I'm sure another place exists, but I haven't found it.  The only black mark.. and it's a fairly sizeable one.. is that the staff is invariably dumb and lazy. They rarely help you find anything, and even if they knew what you were talking about, they probably couldn't see to help you because their hair has been combed over one eye. The girls that work there apparently have one qualification: cup size. They lost a star for that. Meh.  Even so, probably the best record store in the valley, despite the Special Olympians that work there.

This used to be my favourite comic shop in the valley hands-down, I've been popping in every couple of months or so since I was still in elementary school. Back then, it was in a different building, but even up until the last year or so the staff have been really helpful. Most of the things I read and watch are foreign, so up until a few months ago, the staff were incredibly helpful in tracking down whatever it was that I was looking for.  Well, I don't know where they got their current staff, but they need to send them back. Most days I walk in, I'm either ignored completely while the staff seems to have disappeared, or when they are there, the person I can only assume is the manager (?) hits on me. I realise I'm taking my life into my own hands as a female entering a comic shop, but the staff there is awful either way.  The prices I can forgive if the service is at least going to be good. But Atomic Comics charges WAY more than other stores in the valley, especially on back issues, toys, and shirts, at least from what I've seen. I don't remember if they were always this pricey, but for less money I can go down to All About Books and Comics, Hero Comics, or wherever and buy back issues for cover price with a floor staff that actually seems to know what they are doing.   One of the more aggravating things I've noticed is how often they rearrange this store, as well. It's like navigating a labyrinth some weeks just trying to get to the posters in the back. Only instead of a minotaur in the center, there's an asian guy waiting to hit on you, or some kids screaming and playing magic cards. I haven't noticed the big card tables outside on weekends in a long time, maybe they finally cut the card playing out or something, but either way that's really the only positive thing I can add.

I recently had something of a crisis.   ...and by crisis, I mean my computer blew its brains out. After pestering the living piss out of the gentleman next door (he works at Honeywell, but I've added "Free Tech Support for Cassi" to his letterhead for the time being) I was informed that my hard drive was a cheap turd likely manufactured from twigs by an enslaved infant in Thailand, which, I suppose, accounts for its six-month lifespan.   'No big deal,' I thought. 'I'll just head over to the local electronics merchant and pick up a new one.'   I'm a recent (legal, I swear!) English immigrant, and thusly, haven't had the opportunity to experience all the wonders of Phoenix, Fry's Electronics being among them (*Snort* I'm a nerd. We consider these things wonders).   I was completely blown away by the sheer size of the place. It's like a Super Wal-Mart, except sans the roving hordes of unsupervised toddlers with full diapers knocking over everything in sight and screaming in spanish. And filled with expensive things.   First off: a big thumbs up to the architect. Big stone columns and theme-park-style, sand-blasted aging done to the store logo? As I stepped into the glorious air conditioning, I found myself humming the theme to 'Jurassic Park'. And THANK YOU, to whomever laid the store out! The hard drives were right up front, so I didn't have to make a cross-country jaunt to the far corner of the store or anything.   I was immediately accosted by a gentleman with what looked like a fauxhawk hairdo (Cassi didn't wear her contacts that day) and soon enough, the blonde, blurry mass asked if I was finding everything okay. "Like, chya, broseph... I think I'm doing alright." Unpleasant flashbacks to Zia Records.   I was less than thrilled with their prices, but to be fair, I was looking for a REALLY big hard drive, so it would likely be expensive no matter where I got it. I was only bothered two more times, which is slightly less annoying than my same-day trip to Best Buy, where I had to fight my way to the checkout counter by beating their hard-selling associates away with my purse. So... good for Fry's, I guess?

Okay, so... I finally hopped on the Pizzeria Bianco bandwagon, after noticing the unyielding avalanche of praise being thrown its way.  (Actually, if I'm being perfectly honest, I only happened by because I went to see the Star Trek Exhibit at the Arizona Science Center - *Snort!*)  I knew in advance about the insufferable wait, and it certainly appeared as described. Worse, even, than I had previously been made aware. For a sense of scale, let me simply say that I brought my Nintendo DS... and beat a game.. and started another one..  ..and still had to wait another hour.  But, Jesus Tiberius CHRIST, was the food worth it! Mind you, I had been previously assured that the pizza was delicious, but I wasn't quite aware that it would be completely unlike anything I've stuffed down my gob prior. Fresh tomatoes, fresh dough, fresh cheese, fresh seasonings, Fresh Prince (psyche!) - that's this place's secret. The tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, not some canned, processed rubbish. I could make a meal of the crust, alone.  I'm not even a food snob about this sort of thing. I happily proclaim that Little Caesars' 5 1/2 dollar pizzas are some of the yummiest pies around. But this pizza is truly Ninja Turtle-worthy. Worth both the wait and the above-average price. I want to buy the guy who made it a drink - non-alcoholic, mind you, because an adult beverage might prompt him to take a break.. and we simply cannot chance that.

Most people will try to tell you that Zia Records is the best record store in the valley. Those people would be correct.  Why the low score, then? Because being Crown Prince of the Turd Playground that is Phoenix's record store selection is not exactly a glowing accomplishment. This store does several things wrong.  For one, this location in particular pesters the shite out of you. "Are you finding everything alright?", "Are you finding everything alright?" YES! Jesus Christ, I was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me, now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so I can shop and eventually give you my money!  I'm sure it's this economy business that's to blame, and not necessarily corporate nonsense, but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them. And it's just this store! I went to the T-Bird location and wasn't bothered. Someone casually asked me if there was anything I needed, and I said "No" and was done with it. But at this store, I was literally asked three separate times by the SAME IDIOT if I was finding everything okay!  Perhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere. Censored Rap (Not that I'm a fan, but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile) 70's Funk and bad Butt Rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum. Though, in fairness, perhaps it's just the staff during the morning or something. I notice at night it gets a bit better... if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if you're doing okay long enough to even notice.  I've never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the Trade Counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff, though, so I'll leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model. I will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape... if you don't count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything!   You inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers. They're worse than Gamestop, that way. I payed for it, it's mine. Why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my album?  Bad neighbourhood, too.  I hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive, but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as I just went earlier today. I guess their prices are good, unless you want something newish. In which case, bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice I can offer.  Just know what you want. Go in. Get out. And for god's sake, avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landmines.  Or just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location. Or Bookman's. I know I will.

Wow. Didn't vote for this thing. And had I known that the primary users of the infamous "folly trolley" would be the same snotty, elitist Scottsdale pricks who - fresh off the plane from Los Angeles - regularly clutter up our freeways with all manner of comically inconsiderate driving-related antics, I would have commited voter fraud simply to prevent this ridiculous waste of state money's passage. But I digress.  The thought process of the think-tank that concocted this monument to instant obsolescence must have been as follows:  Stuffy Snobsdale Suit # 1: Alright, folks. Phoenix has a public transportation problem. But rather than address it by building something that goes faster and further than anyone could hope to go on Phoenix's impossibly congested freeways and streets, let's grandstand about greenhouse gas emissions and build a glorified trolley that - at maximum speed -  goes the bloody SPEED LIMIT.  Stuffy Snobsdale Suit # 2: I'm prepared to agree, provided that it stops at stop-lights and precludes the adjacent lanes of traffic from going forward, thus creating more problems than it ultimately fixes.  Stuffy Snobsdale Suit #1: DEAL! Now, on to pointless smoking ordinances...  *Ahem*  Oh, yeah, I rode the thing. Alot of people have been talking about the cleanliness of the cars... I would have to disagree on that one. Sure, the cabin doesn't reek of urine or anything, but some of the surfaces do have that dull, darkish dirtiness to them (think, the ball-pits at McDonald's). The colors of the car's innards remind you of maybe the New York subway system, but with less fecal matter (give it time)... and of course, with 99% less speed or usefulness. Honestly, the Universal Studios tour bus moves faster than this nearly-inert silvery heap. And while we're on the subject of its shiny exterior, who painted this pokey, pastel metal tube? I haven't seen this much pastel green since Miami Vice.  While I bemoan the primary passengers of the Metro Light Rail, I do have to laugh at their misfortune as a Tempe Soccer Mom finds herself sitting directly across from a smack-addicted hobo, even as I suddenly find myself humming the theme to 'The Odd Couple". The price I really can't complain about. Not too high, not too cheap. But more than once I felt like just getting out and walking.

I heard about this place through my mechanic, actually. He just had to do a quick repair, didn't even need to leave my driveway to do it, so he asked if I would mind taking five dollars down to a place I'd never heard of, just down the street... a Japanese fast food place called 'Ichi Bowl'.  Assuming he would likely cut me a break on some of my soon-to-be-incurred repair expenses, I legged it down there, fully expecting some run-down Korean-owned not remotely Japanese knock-off. My impressions changed the minute I stepped up to the front door. For one thing, they had classical Japanese arrangements playing through the P.A. system which actually played outside on the patio area. They also had a sort of raised area and an authentic-looking noodle / sushi bar area. It actually reminded me of several of the noodle bars I had stopped in while in Osaka a couple of years back. Make no mistake, Ichi Bowl is a fast food place... but as a nice, relaxing environment to take in an afternoon meal, it's actually a nice sit-down restaurant as well.  My mechanic wanted a regular 'Ichi Bowl' and seeing as the things are barely over $4, I decided to try one, too. I popped the lid on the little styrofoam bowl thingiemabob and to my amazement... was what looked like freshly diced chicken in some pretty good teriyaki sauce. The best part of it all was that the thing wasn't swimming in saccharine teriyaki syrup, it was a nice, light drizzling with veggies on a bed of white rice.  Good stuff! I couldn't even finish the thing, either! It's very filling with just the bowl!  I plan to try some of the other dishes they offer, but I must say that I am very impressed with their signature dish. How is a place this great still a secret?
