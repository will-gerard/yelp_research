I won't be going here again for dinner.   The waitress hardly came over to check up on us. I could understand if she had other tables to attend to...but she only had one other table besides ours! It took us over 20 minutes for us to actually pay for our bill. When my friend and I both asked for refills (we both had the same drink) she came back 5 minutes later with one refill...then asked if I wanted one too. Well obviously...I'm the one who asked in the first place...  The food was bland. I have been here one other time and figured maybe it was just an off night. But...this time around the food was just as horrible. We hardly ate our meals.   All together...not a great experience. I'll stick with Oregano's if I want Italian.

Went here for dinner last night with a friend.  We ordered the Cheesy Garlic Toast as an appetizer. It was okay...just a piece of toast with slightly melted cheese on top. Could have been better. For dinner we got a 14" pizza with all pepperoni, half pineapple and half green bell peppers. It was so good!! The crust was nice and crispy...and the toppings were plentiful. Also, the proportions were great. Enough for leftovers the next day. Even the pricing wasn't bad. $18 for pizza, appetizer, and two drinks!  I'll definitely be coming back.

The service here was great! You always hear the horror stories about going to a dealership and having the pesky salesmen follow and harass you. This definitely wasn't the case for me.  I arrived and was treated great! They went through the options I could afford and found the best deal for me....I ended up purchasing a car that day.  It has now been a month and a half and I had to call about a question...they still remembered me and were very nice and helpful. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking to purchase your next vehicle.  Jeff and Barry are great!
