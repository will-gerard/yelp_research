I love the ambiance of this place. We dined on a comfortable, leather sofa in the cozy cellar downstairs. It was candle lit, intimate, and had good mood music playing. It would be a wonderful place to bring a date you would like to impress! We had a bottle of Shiraz wine, mushroom toasts, sliders, tortilla crusted halibut, and some creme brule. Everything was delicious & our server was very knowledgeable. We will DEFINITELY be back!

This place is fantastic for a restaurant chain. (It is part of the same group that own's Houston's). The three times I've been there it has been really busy, but we got great service every time. My favorite items on the menu are the Coconut Shrimp Roll & the tortilla soup! The soup changes daily, so they only have it once or twice a week.

I have been to this Postino location probably 10 times now and I am definitely a fan! I've been in for lunch, which is a bit of a different vibe than after dark. I think the service is better at lunch, probably because they are less busy. Either way, the wine selection and food are great. I agree with other reviewers that the $20, Monday & Tuesday nights, after 8pm deal is awesome! You get 4 bruschetta & and a bottle of wine for only $20! The vibe of this place at night is neat. It's dark, & dimly lite with tea light candles. There are a few comfortable sofas, high top tables, regular tables, and a great patio outside. It has a very intimate feel and would be a great place for a date. It does get very busy & crowded in the evening so keep that in mind. There is usually a wait on Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm. Service gets a little slow during their busy times. My favorite bruschetta is Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It is very sweet! If you're desiring a salad the Raspberry Chicken salad is great. Very flavorful! I also really like the Turkey Panini, very tasty! The only bad thing I can say about this place is the parking is awful! More often than not, you'll end up having to valet your car because there is very little parking.

I love Hubbard Family Swim School! We started with our daughter in their free, baby splash class at 3 months old. The free class is available to babies 6 months & under is great for getting your child acclimated to & comfortable in the swimming pool. Our daughter is now almost 20 months old & just moved into the Lil Snappers Advanced class. She can climb out of the pool on her own, jump into the water without fear on her own, hold her breath & swim with minimal assistance for 5-6 seconds, blow bubbles in the water, reach down in the water to pick up objects 1.5 feet below the surface of the water, etc. It's absolutely amazing. I'm very pleased! Thus far, I can recommend Katie, Lana, Ed, & Vanessa for instructors. They are knowledgeable, great with kids, & enjoy what they do. I highly recommend Hubbard. The only thing I would change is add some additional change-after-swim rooms!

I am a huge fan of The Good Egg! They have the best flavored coffee. They have a different flavor every day, so check out the white board by the door as you're walking in to see what it is! I love their country style potatoes & omelets as well. The food comes out in a timely fashion & the servers are always polite & provide great service. My best friend highly recommends the Santa Fe straw sandwich if you're looking for more of a lunch entree.

I love Papago Buttes! My kids actually get excited to go & see Dr. Sotelo! They are everything I was looking for in a pediatrician & their office. The office people are always helpful & friendly. The sick & well children have two, separate areas & entrances which is great too. Dr Sotelo is friendly, thorough, & seems genuinely interested in providing quality care for children. He never makes us feel rushed which is refreshing. It's a medium size practice so it doesn't seem like patients are herds of cattle waiting for long periods of time in the waiting area to see the doctor. I recommend this practice & Dr. Sotelo to friends & family all the time. My friend who was a NICU nurse at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea takes her son to him & recommended him to me!

I have been to Ajo Al's probably over 50 times over the last 15 years. This is definitely one of my favorite mexican restaurants. The chips are a bit greasy, but taste amazing. If you like hot salsa, request the "hot red salsa". You have to ask for it, they don't just bring it out. For years I would gorge myself on the gigantic Pollo Con Queso entree. I really don't enjoy over eating & a couple years ago I discovered the mini chicken chimi's on the kids meal... I order that, asking for it "con queso style" and I still have left overs to take home! They also have an awesome seasonal Watermelon margarita. If it's not currently on the menu, the mango margarita is delicious as well!

This is my favorite Thai restaurant yet. It's not your usual hole in the wall either, it's actually a pretty nice place with good ambiance. I highly recommend the Crispy Basil Chicken. It is FABULOUS! Sweet, crispy, and spicy. Beware of the spice level: Mild Hot (The heat the average person likes I think) Very Hot (Pretty spicy... my fav) Thai Hot (Too hot for the majority of people) Chef Hot (Only for people who can bare the hottest of the hot!)

I have been to this place at least a half a dozen times & I absolutely love it! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk in you are pleasantly surprised with their outside patio and water features! They have an excellent happy hour as well. I was brave and tried the Habanero cheeseburger one night & it was fierce! It was delicious going down, but I regretted it the next day! Haha... I also love the Cavern Chicken Salad & the Lobster Enchiladas! Yum yum!

Great spa... If you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is the place for you. Neat water fall room, roof top pool, and eucalyptus room! I've had multiple massages here & they were exceptional. Outstanding customer service too.

After hearing mixed reviews from friends and reading mixed reviews on Yelp, I finally decided to give this place a try! We walked in on a Saturday night in October to find they had an hour long wait. The bar was wide open, so we decided to go that route instead. We were informed when we sat down that we could only order appetizers and the bar. This to me was very disappointing. I decided to try and keep an open mind anyway. I ordered the Shrimp San Remo, which came highly recommended on here and thought it was delicious. The sauce was definitely the main attraction. The shrimp were a little on the small side and it only came with six, so I asked if I could get a little side salad of some sorts. Nope, only appetizers at the bar. No salads either. WTH?!?! My boyfriend ordered the mussels appetizer and said they tasted like the mussels you buy at Fry's down the street. So unfortunately, my first experience was not so good. I would be willing to try it again if I am able to order off the full menu. Not being able to order the full menu at the bar when the place isn't that busy is ridiculous in my opinion!

If you love great margaritas & spicy mexican food you will LOVE Los Dos Molinos! The service isn't the best, but the food definitely makes up for it. The downside is they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.

How have I not done a review of this place yet?!? I have been coming here since like 2004! This is probably my most favorite sushi place overall. I highly recommend the Scottsdale roll (spicy scallop roll), the tootsie roll, dragon roll, Las Vegas roll, Kobe pear martini, the delicious frozen Passion Mango martini, & the coconut chicken skewers.Their happy hour is such a great deal & the people watching is awesome! Trout & cougar city baby! The service isn't always great at the high tops in the bar when they are really busy. It is by far the best place to sit & people watch though. The Teppanyaki table experience is good too if you are with a group of friends/family. The food is tasty & the presentation is entertaining & fun. I just love going to this place for happy hour with my girl friends!

This place is a great concept! The employees are very friendly, explain their products/services in great detail, & are always checking in with you to make sure everything is going great. I have had my two dogs in here twice now. They supply everything & clean up after your done! To be honest, my boyfriend and I find the whole experience to be fun & engaging. Who knew bathing your dogs could be so much fun? They use all natural products & offer great baked goods, made especially for dogs. I always get my dogs a couple of them afterwards as a treat for being so good. There is also a cute resident schnauzer who wanders around the place. The only down side is the price. It's a bit expensive, so we don't go super often. (I think the prices ranged from $13-20 per dog depending on the wash you choose).

If you're looking for fresh seafood, great ambiance, & exceptional service you need to check out Mastro's Ocean Club. Their seafood is flown in fresh daily. If you order a martini, you not only get a full martini glass, but a half full shaker as well. Even the bread basket is delicious! (I have a soft spot for the pretzel bread). The halibut is delicious, but the vanilla battered lobster tail is my absolute favorite. Like flavorful mashed potatoes? Order the Mastro's mashed potatoes! The sweet potato steak fries are delicious as well. Looking for a great steak instead? No worries. They serve the same great steaks that they serve at Mastro's Steakhouse & City Hall Steakhouse!

This is a local gem! From the outside it doesn't seem like much. However, the owner, employees, & food is awesome. Try the salad bar & make sure you get some potato salad. It's the best potato salad I've ever had. The prime rib is always a good choice too. I love how cozy & comfortable you feel when you're dining here.

To begin, I really wish I could rate the food and the service separately. I would give the service a 1 and the food a 4. I had been wanting to go to The Farm at South Mountain for some time now and waited until the weather cooled down in order to go try out this place I have heard so much about. The organic farm, rose garden, picnic tables, shade trees, and the whole ambiance of the farm was wonderful. It was almost like we weren't in Arizona anymore.         As we approached the hostess she was clearly not the most patient of people. She stated that she was not going to wait long for people to come up to claim their table when she called their name. You practically had to run up there in order to get seated at your table, otherwise she swiftly moved down the list to the next name. I think allowing people a good 60 seconds to make it up to the hostess to claim their table sounds reasonable, don't you? To be fair, it was 12:30pm and I think they close at 1, but still...  She directed us to our table where we sat ourselves to view the menu. The server came over and promptly informed us that they were out of french toast, the Monte Cristo, and that you could not order bacon or sausage on the side. The only way you could get bacon or sausage is if you ordered an item on the menu that included it. Apparently they were almost out of that too! A bit ridiculous if you ask me. I ended up ordering the Blueberry Waffles which were absolutely phenomenal. The whipped cream on top was the best whipped cream I have ever tasted. My dining companion ordered the American Breakfast and asked for the eggs on the side, on an additional plate because he is allergic to eggs. Of course, the plate ended up coming out with the eggs on the plate with the rest of his food. Food allergies should be taken seriously. Obviously, the allergy note got lost somewhere along the line. I ended up eating his eggs, which were really great as well. I also tried the breakfast potatoes that came with his breakfast and found them well seasoned and very tasty.        My dining companion will not be returning to this restaurant. Normally after an experience like this I wouldn't either. I did really like the food & ambiance though, so I will probably give this place another try. I think I will come earlier so they don't run out of the french toast again! I really wanted to try that... I hope that I am able to revise this review in the future.

This place is fantastic! If your child isn't walking very well yet, I recommend holding off a bit. For the price, it just isn't worth it. We brought our daughter here for the first time a few months after she turned 1. There are 3 floors of fabulous things to do for kids of all ages! If you have a young one, the under 3 room on the 3rd floor is perfect. In fact we spend most of our time there. (My daughter is almost 20 months old now). There is an employee standing at the entrance monitoring who comes in and out. Unlike the malls where kids who are clearly too old dominate the play area, these employees make sure the big kids stay out! My daughter loves the pretend grocery store as well, but it can turn bad if there isn't a cart available for her to push around the room. We ended up getting an annual pass & as long as you go a few times it pays for itself. Definitely the most economical way to enjoy the museum. If you can come in to play after 12:30 in the afternoon it tends to be a lot less busy too!

I have had the pleasure of receiving 6 or so massages at this wonderful spa. The service is always up to par & the massages have always been excellent. The decor is lovely... It's quite a hike up the stairs to get to the spa, but they have an elevator you can take up as well. I definitely utilized the elevator during my 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Speaking of pregnancy, they do an absolutely phenomenal prenatal massage! The tables they use are adjustable & they actually make you very comfortable which is hard to do in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. It's also really nice to relax in the private spa pool. It's serene & not over crowded like the other main pool. It has an elevated, up close, breathtaking view of Camelback Mountain. Enjoy lunch while you're out there too. They have a very tasty spa-poolside menu! Best tip? Go on a Monday for their "Spa Happy Hour" to get discounted prices on spa services!

I had been going to Camelback Pediatrics since my daughter was born. She is 11 months old. Initially I really liked the place because they were able to get us in right away when needed. I have had 2, inexcusable, bad experiences and have since decided to no longer take my daughter there. To be fair, Dr. Alexander is phenomenal. I REALLY like him, but the practice he works at is terrible.  Bad Experience #1: I had taken my daughter to urgent care on a Friday because she developed a really high fever (103.5). The doctor told me that she was probably fighting a viral infection & to watch it because it could be a urinary tract infection. She said if my daughter wasn't better by Monday to take her into our regular pediatrician. Her high fever continued so I took her into Camelback Pediatrics and saw Dr. Scharff on Monday. He decided that it was a good idea to get a urine sample & we had to do it via catheter. (My poor lil baby!) He told me that if we didn't hear back from them by 2pm the next day to call in to get the results of the urinary analysis. Sure enough, we didn't hear anything by 2pm so I called the office at about 2:20pm. No answer. It was the Tuesday before the 4th of July which fell on a Wednesday this year so the office had closed early!!! I called the after hours answering service & they said to call back again & they'd page the doctor again if they didn't call me back within 45 minutes. I did this FOUR TIMES. Finally the person at the answering service told me that they had talked to the doctor being paged and were told that the doctor did not have access to lab results from home. Okay, fine. Why couldn't the doctor call & tell ME that the first time I had her paged??? The doctor on call was Dr. Apley. I have seen other negative reviews about this pediatrician as well. Most people know that if a urinary tract infection goes untreated it can become a kidney infection which is quite serious. My husband and I decided to take out daughter to Phoenix Children's Hospital since her fever was still really high & the pediatrician never got back to us with the test results and we'd have to wait until Monday to get them. It's unbelievable that an office would close early a day before the holiday without making sure all patients had been given their test results. Especially one as potentially serious as my daughter's. It was double bad that the doctor on call didn't have the courtesy to at least call ME back the first time she was paged and tell me they couldn't get the results for me. Unbelievable. So my daughter ended up getting a catheter again because of their irresponsibility.   Bad Experience #2:  I was recently out of town and my daughter got a really bad diaper rash. I tried different diaper rash creams and nothing seemed to phase it. Friends of mine had told me that their pediatricians had prescribed diaper rash creams that cleared it up quickly. So on Friday morning, I called the pediatricians office & put in a prescription request at 8:30am. Since I know how they do things, I called back at 4:30pm to check on the status of my request. The lady told me that they hadn't gotten to it yet, but to call my pharmacy after 5pm to check to see if they got it. Sure enough I call the pharmacy at 5:45pm and no prescription was called in... The pediatricians office closes at 5pm and it was a Friday. So basically they left me out of town, for an entire weekend with a baby with a horrible diaper rash. I called in on Saturday morning just to make sure they perhaps didn't get it submitted until after office hours & nope, no prescription. That was the final straw!!!! I am done with them.

I have been to the Arcadia location quite a few times and this is what I liked better & worse about this location.  Better: There is definitely more parking at this location. This location is bigger, so they have more seating available.  Worse: I think the ambiance of the Arcadia location is better.  The service & quality of food at both locations is consistant I would say. See my review on the food & service on the review section of the other Postino!

I have eaten at this location 4 times now and have had an enjoyable experience each time. Yes, it is a chain. It does not try to be, nor claim to be a locally owned & operated restaurant. That being said, it is a very nice chain restaurant with a slightly upscale feel with lovely decor. I always order the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp and have them add mushrooms to it. I like my diavolo sauce extra spicy so I also add some crushed red pepper which gives it a nice kick! It's a great dish so I don't bother ordering anything else. My dining companions have recommended the crab & shrimp cakes & the grilled salmon as well. The bread basket is also delicious, but be careful not to fill up on it! It's tempting, trust me!

This is definitely one of the nicest sports bars I've ever been to before. They have a great patio, the best sangria I think I've ever tasted, and the Taco Pizza is to die for! The service was good, and I only have one complaint... The parking! I think it is absolutely ridiculous to offer valet parking in such a small lot with very limited parking. I hate when places do that! I will be back! :-)

The chicken was dry & very salty. The waffles were fairly bland. The service was lousy too. If you love salty, sugary, high saturated fat items you may enjoy this restaurant. I'd prefer to clogg my arteries else where, thank you!

I was craving macaroni and cheese one day and a friend recommended this place. I wasn't impressed on my first visit, but decided to give it another try. The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but very bland. I think the noodles were a bit over cooked as well. Since the mac & cheese is only a side dish, I ordered a waffle with it. The waffle was thin (not Belgian), dry, and bland. The syrup made it edible, but I still wouldn't recommend it. I ordered some of the blue kool-aide & they must have added a lot of extra sugar to their mix. It was the sweetest kool-aide I've ever tasted before! This could be a good or bad thing depending on how you like your kool-aide. The service was a little better this visit, but I have had my fill of Lolo's and will not be back!

We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful, sunny, Tuesday afternoon. I ordered a "something pink bikini tini" and it was pretty darn tasty. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were good. The sauce they served with the fries definitely stole the spot light though! It was slightly sweet & creamy. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Rolls & salad off their lunch menu. They were delicious, but I wish they were a little heavier on the coconut. From the looks of their happy hour menu, it looks like a great deal. I will definitely be back to try out their happy hour!

I heard about this restaurant from quite a few friends who seemed to really enjoy it. I thought the interior design was awesome, but that was all I was really impressed with. To be fair, I did not order a steak or fish dish, instead I had a cocktail and the lobster tacos. The cocktails and most of the entrees were over priced in my opinion. The lobster tacos were pretty good, but not worth what I paid for them. I'd try it again and if I do, I may update this review.

I have been to many other Irish pubs around town and this is, by far, the best one around! The servers and bartenders are friendly & assertive. The bar itself is classy, & authentically Irish... You won't see any cheesy shamrock stuff around this place. And best of all, the owners are Irish and you will almost always find at least one of them drinking at the bar or working hard at the pub. The drinks are reasonably priced, especially for Mill Ave. They have a great selection of beers as well. If you're looking for a tasty meal, try the chicken tenders! They are clearly not straight out of the freezer like most chicken tenders. They are moist, white meat chicken, lightly breaded, and not too greasy! They come with shoe string fries, or as they like to call them, "chips"! Haha And if you come in for happy hour, they are 1/2 off! If you're looking for more of a "college party vibe" come in Thursday-Saturday after 10:30pm. They have a DJ outside on the patio and a live band playing insider on almost every Friday & Saturday night. If you haven't been to this local Gem, you must go experience it for yourself!

So I am writing this review after trying the restaurant out 3 times now.   1st Experience: I was with a Bachelorette Party on St. Patrick's Day 2010 and we stopped into RnR. The bartender was friendly & we had great service. Overall a good experience in the 30-45 minutes we were there for a drink & a shot at the bar.   2nd Experience: A friend and I decided to try out there bottomless Mimosa's for $10 one Sunday morning. I recall the Animal fries being tasty & the mimosa's were alright. Nothing special, but worth the money as long as you had 2 or more. The service was so-so. Overall a fairly good experience.  3rd & Final Experience: I can honestly say that today we had the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant in my 27.5 years on this third rock from the sun. To begin, we sat at our table on the patio for 30 minutes before I finally called the hostess over to see if we even had a server for our table. She informed us that there was & she went to find the server. After 5 or 10 minutes she comes back and informed us that they are "swamped" and that she will be taking our drink order for the server. Mind you this was lunch on a Thursday afternoon. This place wasn't anywhere near "swamped". She brings us our waters and informs us a few minutes later that she will also be taking our food order & that she will pass it on to our server whom we still have not seen at this point. As she starts to take our order our server finally shows up at the table. He apologizes and takes our order. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time & the order was correct. Nobody brought us silverware, so I had to request it. Then I realized there was no salt or pepper on our table so instead of letting my food get cold while I waited for our server to reappear, I asked the table next to us if we could borrow theirs. Our water glasses were left empty for 15-20 minutes. And it took forever for our server to bring us our check after we requested it and then it took him equally as long to pick up the check with our payment inside it. I was in absolute shock that nobody offered us a complimentary beverage, appetizer, or dessert for the horrible serve we received which they were completely aware of considering how they kept apologizing. We paid our full $27 bill & left... Our lunch didn't just cost us money, it cost us almost 3 hours of our afternoon. I will not be returning to this establishment.

I absolutely love our neighborhood Zoyo. It has become a family tradition & beloved childhood memory for us & our kids over the last 5 years. It is very kid/family friendly too. I am obsessed with the Salted Caramel yogurt. The Salted Caramel Corn is just as amazing. The place is always clean. The customer service is always good as well. My ONLY complaint is a few of the toppings are inconsistent in their availability. I love the little caramel chocolate cup things. Sometimes they have them, sometimes they don't. Luckily there are lots of other toppings to choose from at Zoyo!

First & foremost, do NOT drive to & park at Cityscape. It's a royal hosing... They charge for parking like they do in Chicago/NYC! Outrageous! This place is really fun... Good service & great food! The pretzel & cheese appetizer is a MUST! It was by far the best I've ever had. I also recommend the sweet potato tortellini entree! Absolutely delicious. This place isn't cheap, but not super expensive either. Next time I go will be to check out their happy hour!

So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it's President Obama's favorite...  The burger was good. Not great, not bland, just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... it's very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you.

After driving by 25 times or so I decided to drop in & try some cupcakes finally. The girl working the counter was bubbly, knowledgeable, & helpful. I selected 4 different cupcakes. A wedding cake, midnight chocolate chip, Peanut Butter Cup, & a Red Velvet one. Like a lot of desserts, they were quite appealing to the eye. They were very pretty cupcakes. To my disappointment the cake itself was dry & not very flavorful. I've had much better cake from a Betty Crocker box, honestly. The frostings were good, but quite excessive. I like frosting a lot & I couldn't finish it all. Lastly, the were overpriced in my opinion. $15 & some change for 4! If I'm going to pay that much, I'll just go to Sprinkles. I really wanted to like this place :-(

Another Upward Project gem (Postino, Windsor)... This time they take on pizza! And as usual, they know how to tantalize the taste buds. My husband and I sat right up at the counter overlooking the kitchen & wood-fire oven. It was busy & lively. I had a mushroom & green pepper pizza which was good, but I think I will go for one of their pizza creations next time. They look interesting & possibly delicious. I was really impressed with their "Great Little Salad" for $4... It wasn't your usual iceberg, carrot & ranch dressing side salad. It truly was a great & a cheap addition to my pizza! I cannot wait to order a pizza for pick up & pick it up via their drive-thru. How cool huh? Every parent's dream!!! ;-)

I've been an LA Fitness member since 2005 & have gone on and off since then. I recently started going to this new location & I love it! I used to work out at the two locations in Scottsdale. I am wayyyy more comfortable at this location! 1st off... I want to be left alone at the gym. I don't like being hounded by personal trainers trying to get me to sign up for overpriced training sessions with someone who took one weekend long personal training certification course. When I approach & talk to them they have been nothing but pleasant & helpful. All the equipment is new & they seem to keep the place clean. I really like that there is a good mix of different "types" of members working out at this location. Not a bunch of 105 lbs. sorority girls wearing make up & talking on their phones while doing cardio or a bunch of meathead steroid monkeys dominating the free weight section. It's refreshing to see mostly REAL people actually working out. This is my new favorite gym hands down! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because they need to improve on their classes & class schedule. There is no pilates class offered at this location. I'm hoping the longer they are open the more classes they will offer!  P.S. I recommend their kids club for kids too. My almost 18 month old daughter loves it! One day I came to pick her up and she was asleep in the caregivers arms! So sweet :-)

So I should begin this post by saying that I LOVE Bagels! I saw this place & the connected sandwich shop next door to it open recently. I recognized the name of the sandwich shop, Capriotti's, because there is one up in north Scottsdale. I've never eaten there, but have driven by it numerous times. This was my first clue that the new bagel shop was probably locally owned & operated. I always prefer to spend my money at those types of places when possible. When you pull up you notice there is very little parking in the front.There is however ample parking behind the building. If you are familiar with his area, you know parking is a bit limited everywhere. I walked in the front door and was hit by a soft sweet aroma. There were large coffee carafes filled with "Peet's Coffee & Tea" neatly lined up along the wall. The place was well lit, organized, and seemed very clean. I walked up to the counter and was greeted by a friendly man. As expected, there was a large selection of bagels to choose from at the counter. I couldn't pick just one so I decided to go with half a dozen. They had some unique bagels on their menu such as tropical & sourdough. The man kindly offered me an extra container of cream cheese & I decided to try the light veggie one. I brought the bagels home and cut into an asiago one. I notice right away that the bagels were big & thick! They looked homemade & not like the usual generic, mass produced ones you get from Buerger's or Einstein Bros. The inside was so moist. It was almost doughy, but not underdone by any means. Impressive! I lightly toasted it and put the light plain cream cheese on it. The cream cheese was delicious. It doesn't taste like it's the light version either. If the light version is this good I wonder how good the regular cream cheese is?!? Out of curiosity I try a taste of the veggie cream cheese on its own. It's also delicious! Again, you can tell this was homemade and not made in bulk somewhere & sent out. A good balance of flavors! This is my new favorite bagel shop. I cannot wait to try the rest of the bagels I bought. Next time I want to try some of their coffee & or bagel breakfast sandwichs. There will definitely be a next time. This is such a great addition to the CenPho neighborhood!

Unfortunately my toddler decided to throw my iPhone 5S into a sink full of water. It was completely submerged for at least 5-10 minutes. I truly thought it was probably done for good, but I decided to give this place a shot since it recently opened down the street from my house. The guy who helped me was friendly, knowledgable, & kept me updated each step of the way. He was really upfront about the costs which were reasonable in my opinion. He was able to run it through a special machine that they have that gets the phone really dry which seemed to solve the issue. Apparently they specialize in water damage. So I am a happy customer with an iPhone 5S that works just fine again & it didn't make too bad of a dent in my wallet either! ;-) I highly recommend you bring your iPad, iPhone, etc. here for repairs.

What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the "bacon guacamole" which was tasty. Next out was "tempura unagi roll" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the "crispy pork belly roll" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the "Lobster & Crab Dynamite" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, "where the cool people hang out" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu.
