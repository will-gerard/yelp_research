The cleaning wasn't cheap, but it has kept my carpets clean for 10 times longer than traditional steam cleaning does.  Thanks!

I saw Dr. Nguyen in both the Chandler and Gilbert offices.  He was exceptionally helpful and went out of his way to accommodate my schedule.  All of his staff were equally impressive.  I ended up needing two root canals, but the experience wasn't bad at all.  Dr. Nguyen even made himself accessible after hours to assist me.

Fast and reliable service, friendly staff, and great prices!  Everything about Apollo Cleaners keeps me coming back.  I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to remove laundry from their to-do list or to receive premium care for a special piece of clothing.

I was so unhappy about the service I received from Wave that I had to wait awhile before leaving this review.  Otherwise, I felt I might react in an overly-critical way.  To be brief, the two women who cleaned my house didn't even fundamentally understand what cleanliness is.    They failed to clean basic parts of my house, such as above doorways and on top of ceiling fan blades.  I even specified the ceiling fans as the most important areas to clean on their first visit.  I could never invite them back because I believe it would be a continuous struggle to get them to clean how I want them to.  I am beyond dissatisfied.

I'll start by saying that the artists at this shop have incredible artistic ability.    I recently got a cover-up tattoo by Juan and couldn't be happier with his work.  The photos I've attached show it after an 8-hour session, so it's about half way finished.  Juan stayed late to accommodate my work schedule and drew the art on the spot.  The colors and line work are incredible!  I highly recommend this shop to anyone who's looking for talented artists who can do more than just tattoo something off the wall (although I'm sure they can do that too).
