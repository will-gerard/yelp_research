For such a big place like the Phoenix area there is a surprisingly horrible selection of Chinese food.  The Gourmet House is a pleasant surprise.  Driving up and seeing the bars on the windows with a bit of an old hole of the wall looking exterior it does make you pause a bit, but don't let that dissuade you.  They have an outstanding Moo Shu Vegetable dish ( Moo Shu pork sans pork).  They bring it out and the server actually wraps them for you using a big spoon and chopsticks without actually handling the flour wraps with her hands.  It's very impressive and fun to watch. I have never seen that done before.  Try: - Moo Shu Vegetables. - Peking Duck

This place is not fancy, it's not new, but it's a great place to see a band.  The bar is in the back and there are seats all around to chill out while listening to the bands.  it's very loud so definitely not the place to go  for a quiet night out by any stretch of the imagination.  I give it the the most points for atmosphere since it revels in it's dive-y-ness.  The sound isn't the best at the couple shows I have been too they always have sound issues of some kind or another.  I think that adds to the charm of the place.  It's a great place to see a $10 band at any rate.  I do not hesitate to go if a band I like is playing there.   The bartenders are very nice and I haven't had any issues with the bouncers although I had tickets all the times I went.

Just go get the bruschetta and the pub platter.  That's all that really needs to be said.

Dr. Bracken is the best vet I have ever encountered.  My dog hurt his back and they took fantastic care of him and found a great neurosurgeon for us to have his back fixed.  All his general checkups and teeth cleaning have been great. The staff there just really seem to love animals and it shows. They even call back to check in to make sure everything is going okay with him. It's a ways to Arcadia from my house ( I live in south Tempe ), but I wouldn't even consider taking my dog to anyone else.  If you are looking for a vet you can't do better than Dr. Bracken.

The best thing about South Mountain is the location. It's nice to get out and about without having to drive more than a couple minutes.  There are really long hikes if you are so inclined. As well as lots of short ones that can be done without a whole lot of planning or worry.  Always print out the map it's pretty easy to get turned around as there are a lot of convergent trail heads in some places.  There are always people on one or all of the trails either hiking or mountain biking on the north east sides of the park. So if you are looking for a solitary lone hiking experience this is not the best place.  There are several entrance and parking points so there is never really a problem parking.  The 24th street / Baseline entrance has a pretty steep hike up to get to the Mormon Loop which is pretty cool. The 48th Street entrance has pretty good parking and is close by as well.  There are some pretty good views of the city and surrounding areas, but you don't ever feel all that remote and on your own as you would in places farther out.   I haven't tried any hikes on the far south side yet, but I'll update when I do.

I had never been here before the remodel so I'm not sure how much has changed, but I really dig the place currently.  It has a very nice contemporary feel and a very complete breakfast menu for being such a small place.  The few times I have been here they have been pretty packed and it can get a bit iffy as you wait for your to go order.  You seem to be in the way no matter where you go.  Aside from that the bagels are delicious, the breakfast burritos are really great and they have excellent OJ.  What more can you want from a breakfast place?  I tried the pancakes which were really good. As is normal for the area they are way bigger than any standard human needs.  They come in three, two, or one.  I went for two, next time it will just be a single.  If you decide to get the three stack bring some hungry friends.  Try: - Pancakes - Breakfast Burrito - Bagels

I have tried this place a few times, but I have to agree the  barristers always seem to be in a bad mood and put out when you order.  They never say hello or seem to even want you in the place.  There are always a couple people in there so maybe they just like their regulars.  I always get the same thing at every coffee place, a mocha, and the ones here don't ever taste like espresso or chocolate they always taste like milk.  If you are in the shopping center I guess it's passable, but I wouldn't go out of my may since there is a coffee place in every shopping center here.

This is a much better mexican place than the overall score would lead you to believe.    The service is pretty great.  No waiting to have your drinks refilled and always cheerful and pleasant staff.  The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice decor with the required Dos X most interesting man in the world cut out.  They have a nice patio  to eat,drink a beer or hang out.  The food here has always been better than I would expect from a chain mexican restaurant. They seem to do a much better job than the other chains in the area.  The salsa is a bit hotter than you would expect, which is always welcome, with some very good chips. The lunch combos offer a few non-meat choices with some excellent tostadas.  Try:  - Tostadas - Enchiladas

I heard about this from DDD, but I wasn't going to hold that against it.  This place is fantastic having delicious food and reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for?  They have the best Chile Reno Burrito I have had in the area. I order it enchilada style since they have great sauce.  The tortilla is soft and fresh made wrapped around a chile reno, rice, and potatoes. It is fantastic.  They have red and green sauce for all their food get extra green sauce, it's spicy and addictive.  The tostadas are really good as well if you want something crunchy to go with your tacos.  The staff are always friendly and the food comes out pretty quick for how busy they always are.  It's a pretty small place so it can fill up at busier times, but you can always get it to go and it's still just as good.  Try - Chile Reno Burrito - Green Sauce - Tostadas - Veggie Tacos - Ask for the habanero Salsa

I ate here the other day and thought it was great, I will definitely be going back.  From the other reviews maybe I'm biased since I'm a guy. I had a chicken pita and tried my friends gyro and thought they were both very good.  I didn't find the fries were overly greasy since the little paper sack they came in soaked up some of the oil. I even really liked the fake cheese sauce that came with the cheese fries ( sue me! ). I found the interior very clean for a small "greasy spoon" not as dumpy as you would think.  The staff was very nice and my food came out lightning fast.  For a quick lunch I highly recommend it.

The staff are very friendly and knowledgable about pool maintenance.  I usually get my Chlorine tabs from them as you don't seem to need to use as many of them to keep the chlorine up.  The ones I was getting from the Wholesale Club seemed to never keep the chlorine up.  Another great thing is when your pool robot conks out they will fix it for just the cost of parts which is really nice.  They have kept my Hayward bot in tip top shape.  They will also do water tests and sell you the odds and ends to keep everything working.  Great pool store.

Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  It's just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever.  So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House?  1. Lots of parking 2. It's not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean  So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area.

I eat at this location pretty regularly and have always had a great experience.  I usually eat here for lunch which is always fast and delicious.  Their have a daily special that hits the spot most days when I venture away from my main stay the Pad-See-Ew.  They food is very spicy, but can be tailored to your heat index.  I always go with a medium (5).  As far as I can tell there are only 2 ladies that work there during the day.  Both of them are always cheerful and helpful when I come in.  They seem to be extremely friendly with everyone that comes in.  I always see lots of smiles and I am in there a lot.  A few reviewers mentioned dinner service is a bit on the bad side.  I won't make excuses for them, but it is a small restaurant if you have a very large party maybe you can call ahead.  I took my parents there on a Saturday evening.  Things were pretty busy and you could tell there was a lot going on.  It was kind of chilly outside so the seating did seem to be an issue for some of the later arrivals.  If nothing else definitely stop by this location for lunch it's very good.  Try: - Pad-See-Ew - Pad Thai - Yellow Curry - Purple Sticky Rice

I am upping them to 5 stars as I just have a consistently great experience at this location.  There is another location down the avenue near the Intel Plant which is also pretty good, but they are always super busy for lunch ( Go Figure ).  The two ladies who work here during lunch are always exceptionally nice, the food comes out super fast, and it's always delicious.  I have taken everyone I know here for lunch and dinner and it's always been a great experience.   I still recommend going with medium if you like pretty spicy without burning you up.  Most of the people I have taken like mild food and I have never heard any complaints that they make it too spicy.  So don't be afraid to take your friends who don't really dig spicy foods.   Try: - Pad-See-Ew  ( As far as I can tell the Best in AZ ) - Pad Thai - Crispy Sweet Potato - Purple Sticky Rice

I just have a consistently great experience at this location for lunch, dinner and take-out. The ladies who work the lunch shift are great and always cheerful.  Some of the nicest staff at any restaurant I have had the pleasure to dine in.  The only time I had shaky service were a couple days they had off in the summer.  The replacements were very nice just not up to the usual standard, but I go so often I'm not one to ding new people as they tried.  I still recommend going with medium (5)  if you like pretty spicy without burning you up.    My parents always get no spice (0) as they are sensitive to spicy food.  So don't be afraid to take your friends who don't really dig spicy foods.  There is another location down the avenue near the Intel Plant which is also pretty good, but they are always super busy for lunch ( Go Figure ).   Try: - Pad-See-Ew  (Best in AZ ) - Pad Thai ( Seems Real to Me ) - Crispy Sweet Potato - Purple Sticky Rice

This is a pretty cool location for a PJ.  There is actually a lake out back so you can sit on the patio and watch the ducks.  Very cool for a restaurant in AZ.  The food here has consistently been very good and the wait staff is very nice and cheerful.  They are more of a 4.5 star place to eat.  They get docked a bit because it seems a bit slow sometimes and the restaurant is always very noisy.  If you don't really want to chat it's ok, or just sit outside and watch the ducks.  Try:   - Nachos   - Chicken Tiki Masala   - Hummus   - Steak and Cheese Pita

This place is out of my normal coffee route so I have only been once.  So why am I leaving a review?  For one, my iced mocha actually tasted like espresso and chocolate instead of just milk.  It was very good and highly recommened if you are near here to check out.  The main reason, the barista here is really cool. I didn't pick up his name, but he seemed to know most of the people how come in and picked out I was new even though he was very busy.   It's very fun to watch him speed through the orders and he had a great attitude.  He made the whole place seem that much more friendly and a cool place to hang out.  The coffee shop is right on the corner of the shopping center and you can sit outside and by the lake they have in the back and watch the ducks while enjoying your coffee.

AJ's is not for the cheap grocery visit, but it is a wonderful store.  The meat counter is second to none.  They are very helpful and everything is top quality.  My favorite thing there is all the prepared foods.  From the Deli Salads, Pizza, Sandwiches, Pastries and coffee this place is fantastic.  Things to Get:   - Kobe Burgers   - Veggie Pizza   - Make your own Pasta on Thursdays   - Deli Salads   - Brownies

Yeah another Breakfast Review :)  This is pretty much my go to breakfast place near my house.  They have all the classics and a few things you probably won't get anywhere else.  They have breakfast place coffee that is nothing special just normal ( no fancy drinks ).  The staff is usually right on top of things, I did deduct 1 star since occasionally the food is a bit cold when it comes out.  Not sure why that is, even when they are not very busy.  They have the best blueberry pancakes I have had in the valley, but be warned they are giant. One pancake is more than enough for one person. Who can actually eat three?  Another really cool thing they have here is the crepes-eggs it's an omelet wrapped in a crepe. I always get the LIGHT ONE ( Filled w/fresh spinach, sliced avocado, sliced mushrooms, Jack & sharp Cheddar cheese, served w/a side of homemade Poppy Seed dressing)  it's is a pretty awesome breakfast food and what I get when I am not in the mood for pancakes.  Try: - Blue Berry Pancakes ( They are Huge ) - Light One Crepes-eggs - Eggs Florentine

This used to be one of my favorite spots, but I haven't been here in awhile now.  The last three times I took friends to eat here we were completely forgotten after we were seated.  I can see one time, but three?  The last time after we were seated we sat for 10 minutes and there was not one single employee on the floor.  When we finally decided to leave the manager came from the back and asked why we were leaving.  He evidently didn't notice that there was no one on the floor waiting on anyone.  It's very disappointing I might head back around the food is/was really good.

I went into this location to find one small thing that any hardware store should have, suction cup hooks for windows.  I looked in the cavernous store for about 10 minutes then decided to ask someone who worked there.   This is how it went:  1st Sales Associate :       Should be over with hooks aisle 15 or Mill work. Then we walks away.  2nd Sales Associate stocking on another isle:       Hmm it should be over here.  Yells to another Sales Associate at a desk in doors.    3rd Desk Associate: Informs us that they are nowhere near where we are, and are probably "somewhere" in the tile section.  2nd SA : Head over to tile and ask someone over there they will be able to help you better.  Walk over to the no man's land that is tile....  Guess what; no sales associate.  So I wonder around for a bit then give up and leave.  I know they are a huge box store, but you would think with that many employees it would't take 20 minutes of kinda sort of trying to find something.  I guess if I spent more time in the Home Depot I would know where everything was.

I have been to Wanda's about 4 times since moving here and always enjoyed it.  I wouldn't classify it as an overly greasy , greasy spoon.  I think it's a very comfy place that reminds me of little Mom and Pop's from back east. Since I seem to stick to the breakfast MO... it's been good each time.  They have good diner coffee, nothing exotic, nor was I expecting it.  The waitresses are all very nice, with just the right amount of chattiness to make you feel at home, but not too much.  My breakfast today was a mushroom and cheese omelette + spinach.  My plate of food was huge and very tasty and with Coffee and Tax only $10.  I'll have to stop by here more often.  - Mushroom and Swiss Omelette + Spinach

I agree with what Liz already said.  The one thing I had to mention is the green salsa it is fantastic and makes everything there taste awesome.  They should bottle it.  This is definitely a hole in the wall kinda place with very "home cooked" Mexican food. The restaurant is kinda shabby, but not offensive and the staff are always very friendly.  The food always comes out quick and they make it up right then.

This location is pretty bad.  Be warned if you go in at an off hour they will just let you stand there and never take your order.  I have been here twice and seen none behind the counter at all.  Not sure where they go. They tend to always put way too many raw onions in the burritos.  If you have to eat here tell them to hold the onions.  Maybe the other locations are better.

I have lived down the street for a couple of years, but a good friend from college just moved to town so we needed a place to grab a beer.  Enter the Teakwoods. Since they won 2012 Best Wings ( If you are into that) and it fits the bill nicely. The wait staff are all really friendly from the hostesses to the bus people.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood bar although they do have a separate section of the restaurant for families to hang out so you have less of the "Sweet Home Alabama" looks.  It's a very comfy place with lots of TV's and always a people around.  The wings according to all my friends are very good.  Since I am a vegetarian I highly recommend the ultimate grilled cheese sans bacon.  It's not the healthiest thing you could ever have, but it goes great with a Snake-Bite.  I also appreciate that any of their burgers can be ordered with a veggie patty so you can switch up from the grilled cheese every once in awhile. The food is really good and way above what you would expect from you standard bar food.  This is a great bar if you want a friendly atmosphere and good food.  Try: * Onion Rings * Ultimate Grilled Cheese w/ Snake-Bite * Pretzel Appetizer * $2.99 Jager shots

I stopped in for the first time for breakfast on my birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised by all the vegetarian/vegan options on the menu.  The restaurant is very nice with a classic exterior, modern interior, and great patio .  I was a bit confused where to order, but it could have been my need for coffee.  The staff here are really cheerful and very helpful.  You even get a discount for your birthday which they happily pointed out when she asked how my day was going.  I had the Chilaquiles with vegetables and I was completely impressed one of my top five breakfast foods to get out now.  It's spicy, crunchy, and breakfast all in one awesome plate. I might be the only person to have never tired Chilaquiles before in Arizona, but no longer.  I even got an oatmeal cookie pie for the road.  Which I also highly recommend.  I have only been here once, but I can't wait to go back.    TRY: - Chilaquiles with vegetables - Oatmeal pie Cookie

Ok so the vegetarian went into the hot dog shop...  My friends dig this place quite a bit. I can even admit to liking the old school vibe of the place.  The staff are friendly although they do roll their eyes at ordering a "veggie dog" sometimes, but that is probably involuntary so we'll let it slide.  There always seems to be a line but it's not too bad of a wait to get your food. I have to give them props for having a vegetarian option for those of us who still like to hang out with meat eating friends.  The "veggie" dogs are cooked with the other meat so if you are super strict vegetarian then you may want to skip it. I do not have those qualms so I get mine with the homemade hot sauce and cheese.  They are pretty good for a veggie dog and oddly authentic tasting. Nothing to write home about, but hey what can you do? They have two excedingly awesome things if the meat or "veggie" dogs freak you out, the onion rings and the milk shakes.  Try: - Onion Rings "Crispy" - Milk Shakes

I really love playing pool here.  Some of the other reviewers seem to think it's in a bad neighborhood or something,  but I have never seen anything really sketchy happen there. Just seems like your run of the mill strip mall to me.  There is kind of a rowdy parking lot crowd on the weekends since Graham Central Station is in the parking lot , but nothing too crazy.  The staff there are very friendly and helpful and always check on you to make sure you are doing a okay.  They have a very large number of pool tables to play on hourly and per game.  Are they shiny and new? No not at all, but I like the "Color of Money" neighborhood pool hall feel.  The few times I have encountered a loose pocket or something off with a table it's been fixed the next time I go in.  The hourly pool rates and food prices are very reasonable and the service is great.  Try the Onion Rings and the Sundae :) you won't regret it.  The other bar food they have is nothing new or different, but very good by bar standards.    I would have given this place 5 stars, but they have 3 nights a week they do pool leagues so you can't play during those times.  Which is cool I should probably join a pool league anyway.  If you play pool you should go in and have some fun.

YC's is the best Mongolian BBQ restaurant on this side of the valley.  Yes the meats are shaved and frozen, but that never really bothered me when I used to eat meat.  To tell the truth the other places that don't have super cold meat kind of freak me out.  The staff at this location are always really nice and help out all the new new people who have never been before.  I have taken several friends when they come from out of town and they always think it's a cool place.  The lunch bar is pretty great and always quick and fresh to get in and out of for me. For Dinner they have more options which is kinda cool, but disappointing since I always go for lunch. I'm not sure how many different combos there are for sauce, but there ate several boards listing all the combos.  They all seem to taste similar though no matter how I mix them up.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The standard menu includes rice, soup, and desert ( FROYO like Ice Cream ) which is a fairly good deal.  I highly recommend this location.

Saw Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver and Beck here at different times.  Each time I had a great experience the place is nice and has great sound.  If you are there to get drunk watch out beer prices are insane.  It's an easy location to get in and out of and has lots of parking near by.

I had a business meeting down the street from Kay's and Yelp lead me here for some breakfast to get the day going.  This place is in the middle of nowhere. The only things nearby are industrial buildings and warehouse space. It's very easy to miss driving by as it looks just like another warehouse from the street.    The restaurant is pretty big when you get inside with a counter and good number of tables.  We were greeted warmly by the servers and asked to pick any table.  They were really nice and the place had a cool homey feel to it.  I had a breakfast burrito, no meat, add green chills and it was really good.  If you happen to be way over on that side of town this is a great place for breakfast.  Try:  - Breakfast Burrito

All Hail the "Cronut".  My buddy and I's cross Phoenix adventure to find cronuts lead us to Karl's.  They only had the chocolate one's left, but let me assure you they are delicious.  This love child of a croissant, donut, and eclair is amazing. You can tell they actually make the custard filling as it doesn't have that processed taste almost all creme filled donuts have here. I can't recommend them highly enough.    The lady behind the counter was extremely nice and helpful always a good sign from a local bakery and much appreciated.  They do have a minimum credit card charge of $10 so keep that in mind. They had a ton of stuff from cakes, muffins, bread, etc. so there is plenty to try.  Great place I'll have to make another trek up there.  Try: - French Donuts ( Cronut )

This is a greasy spoon, diner, local hang out place that I usually really enjoy.  The few times I have gone I wasn't that impressed with the food and it's extremely loud in here every time I go.  Which i think is how diners should be except it's really much louder than you would expect.  The waitresses are nice and seem to know everyone which is always good to find.  The few things I have ordered to eat have all been pretty bland and not very good.  The Blueberry pancakes seem to have real blueberries but they are very tough and "chewy" not sure how that actually happens.  Usually blueberries in pancakes are the opposite.  The pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland.  I can't really recommend them.  I have also had an omelet before and it was good nothing to write home about.  So if you stop in I would stay away from the pancakes.

This is our go to lunch spot when I visit my sister.  It is one of the best fast mexican food places around.  They have great salsa, queso, and chips.    Try: - Queso - Spinach Enchiladas - Tacos  The inside is kinda small but they have a good sized patio to sit outside.

As bowling alleys go this place is pretty awesome. It's smaller than most of the other alleys here which is nice.  By far the best aspect is that the balls are kept behind the counter and they help you pick the right one and keep people from stock piling them at their lane.  This may seem like a small thing, but if you are not a professional bowler it's nice not to have to go fighting for a ball when you get there.  I wish all bowling alleys would do this.  The food was bowling alley food. It's nothing to get excited over, but it's fine washed down with a few beers.  The place is very clean and new.  My nieces and nephew had a good time.

Decided to go with a credit union over my main stream bank that kept charging me fees for stupid reasons.  Went into this location and had a great experience.  They had my accounts setup and a real usable check card exteremely fast.  My old bank took days and 3 weeks to get my check cards in the mail.  So far so good when you go in ask for Bebe she is extremely nice and helpful.

Haven't been here in quite awhile, but this is a pretty great place to have a bite to eat.  It would get 5 stars from me, but unfortunately I went on game day and the volume on the game was so loud it was a bit off-putting.  I know it's a bar and football season so it's not unexpected .  If you are in the mod to watch the game it's a very good place to go.  The real standout thing are the beer bread sandwiches.  They are more of a wrap than a sandwich, but very good either way.  At our table we had the mushroom one, chicken one, and the italian beef one all of us gave them high marks.  They also come with some pretty awesome fries.  How do you make a fry better?  Dip it in beer batter!    Try: - anything with beer bread - ice cream cake

With the crazy electrical storms the past few days my AC unit exploded, yes really.  I wasn't sure what to do so from a recommendation from my sister I filled out the web form for Accurate Air on their website ( it was late when the explosion happened ). Their office staff called me promptly when they opened  in the morning and were very nice and sent George out right away.  George came and surveyed the damage and gave me a few options on repairing or replacing the exploded compressor.  I opted for a new AC unit.  They got one from the warehouse and had it installed the new morning in the morning all in about 24 hours.  I had really good luck with them.

Can't add much to what has already been said.  Great hole-in-the-wall diner food with excellent service.  Get the hash browns extra crispy, chip beef gravy, and pancakes.  You can't go wrong.  Be warned the parking is horrible, but that's pretty normal for Tempe places near ASU.  Try: - Hash browns Extra Crispy - Chip Beef Gravy - Pancakes

Took some friends from out of town here the other week and they really enjoyed it.  In fact I always take all out of towners here.  Harlow's is still one of my favorite places to eat breakfast, except the parking is terrible.  I know we have been over this and all of Tempe near ASU has terrible parking so I will move on.  The wait staff are always really friendly and keep your coffee filled constantly while you are here.  The restaurant is the definition of greasy spoon with the pictures of famous people on the paneled walls.  If that is not your thing and you need a $tarbucks atmosphere you should probably pass.  If you get over it then you will have a really great breakfast.  On to why I updated my review.  I ordered the Eggs Maxamillion on my last visit since I am vegetarian now so I couldn't go for my usual standby of Chip Beef. It was one of the best breakfast items I have had since I moved here.  It's hash browns with green chillies ( order them extra crispy ), sitting on a tortilla, topped with a fluffy egg omelet covered in salsa.  It's Huevos Rancheros on crack.  I will be adding this to the breakfast rotation now even though it is a bit of a haul.  Try: - Eggs Maxamillion - Chip beef - Hash Browns ( Extra Crispy )

I just moved here and the Whataburger is right down the street.  I have been there a few times and I really dig the burgers.  They are much bigger than most fast food chains with a slightly toasty bun.  They seem to be a little tricky to order, but I am getting there since I only get them "Plain and Dry with Cheese".  I really enjoy the fries they are slightly squishy which is just the way I like them.  They even have ketchup in the little dunking containers.  The only down side is they seem to take quite awhile when you are in the drive through. Haven't quite figured that out yet.  Maybe I'll go in and order and see if it takes long.

Great place. The wait staff and bartenders have always been great whenever we go.  I usually take my friends here when they come in from out of town as it's a bit of a haul from my house.  The patio is one of the best places to have a  Guinness in Tempe.  Highly recommend it.

Stopped by for lunch the other day and I can say I was pretty impressed.  It's kind of hard to spot since it's in the corner of a very small and crowded parking lot, but don't let that deter you.  I liked the decor and the setup of the restaurant.  Our food came out very fast and was pretty awesome.  I got the orecciette pasta with the "meatballs".  I'm not a fan of fake meats.  If you are going to be vegetarian I say just be vegetarian, but the meatballs in the pasta were more like falafel and were great.  I will definitely be back when I make it to the side of town again.  Try:  orecciette pasta

I've been here twice and both times the servers were nice, but everything seems really disorganized.  This last time we entered and followed the directions to seat ourselves, but the staff kept passing by and not acknowledging us for some reason.  They weren't that busy yet so I'm not really sure what the issue was.  So we decided to move to the counter where one of the waitresses acknowledged that she had seen us. We got our menus and coffee after the move so i would suggest sitting at the counter.  It is a classic diner in decor right out of the late seventies which I think is fun and fitting for a breakfast place.  A bit slow on refilling your coffee and the hash browns need some help as they are pretty bland and need salt like the most of the food.  It's about on par with a Denny's so it's not really worth the hassle.

I went to about 10 other bike stores in the valley to find a new bike and Domenic's was by far the best. I was a little worried by some of the older reviews, but they must have new staff or I hit them at the right time. I wasn't trying to buy some uber fancy racing bike.  I just wanted a standard cool looking bike to head down the street and get coffee or lunch.  The staff here are very friendly and very helpful. Since I wasn't really sure what I wanted they let me look and showed me all sorts of different options.  In comparison to all the other shops who either didn't care I was in the store, were chatting with other people who were't even buying bikes, or just acting like I was bothering them, this was night and day different here. I test drove a few bikes, got some great advice and zoomed out with what I think is a very cool bike at a very fair price.  It's a bit of a drive from my house, but I like to reward good customer service.

What can you say about a rock company?  Do they have lots of rocks?  Why yes they do.  Is the staff nice and knowledgable about rocks?  Yes and they translated my: " the rocks are kinda pink and shiny " into the appropriate order.  Do they deliver on time?  The two times I have ordered rocks, yes they did.  Did the driver know what he was doing?  Yes and was very nice and considerate.  This place is a bit hard to find, but I can't imagine there are better rocks anywhere else in AZ.

I tried this place out based on the many reviews. I seemed to have gone on a bad day or maybe they had a new cook.  The man behind the counter was very nice and helped us pick out something from the menu while we made up our mind.  They have a lot of options which would allow for any combination of asian food one can imagine or be in the mood for.  I ordered the Spicy Szechuan with Tofu which seemed to have  out too quickly is my estimation.  The vegetables were hardly warmed up  and suspended in a huge amount of viscous pink sauce that had no spice at all.  It was so dense and cooled so quickly the veggies were floating in it like jello.  I can;t say I would recommend this place or that I'll be back anytime soon.

I usually frequent the Chandler location these days since it's closer to my house. This particular location has a broader menu so it's more fun to take out of town friends.  Like the other locations most everything is extremely spicy.  Although they actually have a few things that are not  hot and the non-spice eaters I have taken thought it was really good without being firey like the rest of the menu.  So if you have squeamish friends pick this location.  The food is great and always tastes like it's just prepared with great tortillas. The service is a bit slow sometimes, but the the staff is always very nice and the food and margaritas never disappoint..   The salsa is extremely hot at all their locations so warn your friends when you go.  Try:  - Chili Renos - New Mexican Enchiladas - Adovada - Prickly Pear Margaritas

Had lunch here the other day for the first time and it was a very nice experience.  The restaurant is very modern in design, but a little bit too closer quarters.  The tables seem to be a bit too close together so you are siting very close to everyone else near you..  The waitress we had was very friendly and had our drinks refilled before they were empty even though they were fairly busy.  As is par for the course in some places in Phoenix the parking is horrible with most of the good spots reserved for the store next door.  It's a bit of a hike from the back lot to the restaurant .  I'm not sure where you would park if  the lot is full; I guess we lucked out.  The fries were pretty tasty I don't think they are the best I have ever had, but they are quite good. I had the Green pasta as recommend in the other reviews and it is very good and should be tried even if you aren't a veggie person.  We had the brownie for desert, I'm not really a fan of that it tasted a bit too undercooked and it was incredibly sweet.  It tasted more like sugar than brownie/cake like.    Try:   - Green Pasta   - Sweet Potato Fries

This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is. I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.  Try: - Mushroom Party Pizza - Roasted Corn Pizza - Baked Wings - Red Velvet Cake  Only con is the parking is kinda crazy.

Went to see the Avett Brothers here recently.  As a first time visitor I liked it.  There seems to be quite a good amount of parking and the line to get in went very quickly for our sold out show.  After the concert was over we did wait around for awhile on the lawn so I can't comment on how hard it is to get out if you rush out with everyone else.  If you decide to hang on the lawn for a bit it's really easy to get back to where you want to go :).  The was good for an outdoor venue with more than enough room for people to get around and get beer or head to the bathroom. Overall a very pleasant experience and I will be happy to come back.  I'm not sure if I would want to come here in the heat of the summer, but for a fall concert it's a fantastic place.

Great little record store.  The staff is very nice and know way more than I about music.  It's not a huge place, but they have some really neat stuff I didn't find anywhere else in the valley.  They actually have a pretty large parking lot considering their placement downtown so that is always a plus.  They have a a pretty good selection of new vinyl, not that much in the way of used.

I have been here a few times for lunch and taken friends and it's always been a pleasant experiance. I have only ever gotten the Gnocchi alla Vodka  so you mileage may vary.  It's so good I never switch up what I order.  It's a nice restaurant with a cool patio and bar so you can eat outside.  Try: - Gnocchi alla Vodka

It's been a long time since I last visited this location ( I have been going to the outstanding Mesa location ).  I was glad to see that they have expanded.  In addition to the previous area with the long narrow counter there is now a much larger dining room.  There is still a bit of construction going on and when driving by at night the blackout on the windows makes it appear closed which was a bit confusing.  The food takes a bit of time to get at both locations, but it's very much worth it.  They have a pretty expansive and varied menu ( all contained in pastry ) with lots of options for vegetarians.  Our waiter was very nice and checked on us to make sure our beers were full and we got everything we needed.  This is a very unique and awesome restaurant.  Try:  - Egg Plant Parm - Veggie Cottage Pie - Oggie

It's been awhile since my last update and I will have to move Yupha's up on the list of thai places in the valley.  Every time I have gone since my last review I have liked the food even more and more.  I mainly eat the noodle dishes and they are vastly different than all the other thai restaurants.  At first I wasn't sure it was a good thing, but they have really grown on me.  They all tend to be saucier than other versions, but I have really grown to like it.  I'm not sure which way they are supposed to be as I have never been to Thailand so I will say they are good and different.  The staff is here has actually been consistently nice and helpfully.  Today I went for lunch and they were packed ( I actually had left another thai restaurant that had forgotten they had sat me ) but I was seated promptly and my food came out incredibly fast.  I will definitely keep coming here for lunch.  Try: - Iced Thai Coffee - Pad Thai - Pad See Ew - Drunkin Noodles

La Casa Blanca is pretty far from my house I stumbled upon it randomly on a Sunday afternoon drive.  This is a really nice looking restaurant from the street so I decided to stop in.  They have a ton of parking in the rear of the restaurant  and the decor is pretty nice with a big covered patio.  The waitress I had was nice and my food came out quickly.  They have very good chips, salsa, bean dip and guacamole.  My chilli reno was good and came with what appeared to be fresh tortillas.  If I am on this side of town again I will definitely stop in.  Try:  - Bean dips and Salsa - Sitting on the Patio

Coming back home from old town scottsdale we noticed the wood fire pizzeria and gelato place. The yelp reviews were good so what did we have to lose? Pulling into the back they have a pretty good amount of parking for a restaurant in this section of town.  We were greeted by a cheerful cashier and perused the menu of a wide variety of pizza choices, gelato and coffee.  They have a huge selection of gelato in a large glass ounter in the front. It was pretty impressive. It's a bright modern pizzeria inside it appeared from the outside to have an upstairs, but I didn't notice a way to get to it. We grabbed a seat in the outer dining room not noticing it was cleverly disguised out door seating.  I can't really recommend it on unusually cold days in December, but it wasn't too bad.  The pizza guy twirling the crusts on the side counter which was a pretty cool touch.  The food was a pretty good size, came out promptly,  and had a good wood fired crunchy crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings.   I'll definitely be back for another pie and try the gelato and coffee.  Try:  - Veggie White Pizza

I have been here a couple of times now and really dig this place.  They have cold beer on tap and pretty nice staff.  There are plenty of TV's for you to watch any sporting event.  They have NTN trivia with lots of TV's.  It's a very comfortable bar with pool tables, couches, booths and an outdoor patio/sidewalk.  I would rate there food above average just for the fries.  They are really good plain or with cheese.  Their chicken sandwiches and burgers are very good and above what I usually expect from a bar.

I am moving them up to 5 stars with this update.  They are pretty much the best breakfast place on this side of town now.  The speed with which they get the orders out is pretty amazing. I thought it might have just been a weekday thing, but I have been several times on the weekend and they are just as speedy.  The owners when they are there always check on you and ask how your meal is going. The food and coffee are outstanding and very reasonably priced.  What more could you ask for? Just make sure to pick up your silverware and napkins on the way to the table :) as I always get distracted and have to go back.  Try: - Green Chile Corn Quiche  - French Toast ( Awesome ) - Mochas - Eggs Benedict Florentine - Breads

My favorite place to eat breakfast on this side of town.  The staff here are always very friendly and willing to accommodate their customers. I can't really say enough great things about them.  They really make this a wonderful place to  eat.  Most of the time I bring my nieces and nephews since they really like kids here and they have good options for them.  They are always nice to the kids and they have a great time.  The food is always great as well.  The chile corn quiche being a stand out.  It's one of the best things to have here for breakfast.  Having tried the french toast, pancakes, eggs florentine, and most of the menu everything is great and comes out really fast.  If I am in a hurry or with a group we always go here.  If you are on this side of town it's worth a visit.  Try:  - Green Chile Corn Quiche - French Toast - Eggs Florentine

It's been too long since I have updated my review for AZ Bread Company.  This place is fantastic. I have been coming here since I moved to Arizona and it just gets better and better. They have some of the freindliest people working in this restaurant that I have come across. They always say hi, remember you, and are very cheerful.  They food is really great in general from the French Toast to the Egg Salad. I have a fondness for the Green Chili Quiche in particular. It's really good, comes out fast, and unique to their restaurant. They actually are extremely quick to bring out the food even when they appear busy. We always wind up bringing my nieces and nephews here since it's very child friendly. The staff is always happy to see them and take the time to see how they are doing.  This place is a true hidden gem and I for one am glad it's so near my house.  Try : - Green Chile Quiche - Strawberry French Toast - Egg Salad Sandwich

This is a review for their pizza as I have never eaten in the restaurant.  I am a big fan of Siciian pizza and they have some of the best I have had for delivery / takeout.  I highly recommend it if you are in the mood.   If you go in for pickup the staff is very friendly and helpful. SO i would assume dining in would be pretty great.  I am deducting 1 star as I live very close by and it takes 45-hour to get delivery.  Even if you go pick it up it always takes 30 min.  It is good pizza, but not an option if you want it quick :)  Try: - Siciian Joey's Favorite - Siciian Pizza Blanca

Be careful if you are vegetarian and order from here.  The last two times they didn't follow my order and I got a chicken burrito instead of a veggie one. Very disappointing.  If you order the normal stuff and are flexible about what they actually give you then the staff is pretty nice and it's not that bad. It was a guilty thing for me anyway so I'm going to go elsewhere.

This place has very good thai food with a bunch of stuff I haven't seen at other places.  Probably my second favorite down here in Chandler.  The Evil Jungle Noodles are one of the best thai dishes I have ever had.  It is a thai noodle dish with a spicy coconut milk/ Curry sauce. It is pretty difficult to eat since they come in a very compact bowl that seems to hold them steaming and hot for a very long time.  I highly recommend them and hopefully you are less sloppy than me when eating noodles.  They also have a very good Pad See Ew which is my usual goto for thai food.  I always get medium and it's got a fairly good kick. The Evil Jungle noodles seem much spicier, but that could be related to the temperature of being very hot and stays that way.  The tables and booths are a bit worn, and it takes a bit to get your check, but that's not really a deal breaker for me as the food and is very good and the staff has been very nice on my visits.  Try: - Evil Jungle Noodle - Pad See Ew - Salad Rolls

Unfortunately their store doesn't really stand out from the road. I have driven past here numerous times and never noticed it.  Then again, that is pretty standard for strip malls here in AZ.  At least there is yelp.  It's located on the opposite side of the street from the Wells Fargo, under the big ESPRESSO sign.   This is a cool place that has a few tables inside and outdoor seating and have breakfast breads and lunch sandwiches.  The Mochas are pretty great here and so far there has been no line and very quick service.  I had a Morning glory muffin that was very good and my dog enjoyed the dog biscuits I got him.   If you are headed down Warner in the morning or afternoon you should stop in.  Not sure if it was a special for St. Patty's day, but the Guinness and Gouda bread is awesome.  Try:   - Mocha - Morning Glory Muffins - Guinness and Gouda Bread ( Hope it's not just a St. Patty's thing ) - Dakota Bread

I wasn't really expecting this to be a clone of the Cheesecake Factory when I went with some out of town family, but it was very similar.  The menu is way too large and covers nearly every kind of food you can think of except only having about two Vegetarian options which is a bummer. The restaurant was extremely hot the night we went not sure if they were over compensating for the cold weather or what, but it was very uncomfortable.  My meal was a pretty poor interpretation of stir-fry with tofu I can't really recommend it as anything you should go out of your way for.  Even the fried green bean appetizer was just a greasy soggy disappointment. The frozen food ones from the grocery are better and cheaper. Everyone I was with thought it was okay, but nothing spectacular.

Ok here's an update. Just to give a little back info the owner of JJ emailed me through yelp because he was concerned about my low review and bad experience.  I thought that was kind of impressive he would actually care that much. He was nice and I had kind of forgotten about it.  Well it was a really pretty day in AZ and I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to give it another try. Maybe it could have been an isolated incident and I don't like to be an evil yelper. I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast ( good start ).  Ordered the veggie tacos which came out promptly.  This was about the same time I ate here last time just for reference. Taylor my waiter informed me there is a salsa bar so I headed inside to grab some salsa verde.  The tacos were quite good as well as the rice and salsa verde. I'm not usually a fan of black beans, but they really were nice. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4.  I'll be back, but so far seems like I just hit them on a bad day last time.

I just moved here about a month ago and everyone said "You have to get an In-N-Out burger".  I was really digging "Whataburger" but I decided to try this place out.  I should have just stayed away.  I had to wait in the drive through for about 15 minutes and my double burger was tiny, cold and raw in the middle.  Not pink or slightly under cooked but raw with an odd char on the outside.  The fries were half burnt and reminded me of "Potato Sticks" from when I was a kid, but not nearly as good.  I let my dog have some of it because it was so gross and it made him sick for 2 days.  I'll just stick with "Whataburger" or even McDonald's. I have no idea why this place would ever get a 5 Star review.

These guys did a fantastic job sharpening my knives, maybe too good.  My sister and I had our knives sharpened while we waited. They are very reasonable and quick on our visit.  They did a great job fixing the dings and the broken tip on my knives. Now they are better than when they  were new.  I didn't have time to check our their knife selection on my last trip, but I will definitely check them out next time my knives are dull.  I highly recommend.

This is kind of a dual review one of the facilities which are great. It's more like a spa than a gym.  I would give them 5 stars for the facilities.  So why did I give them 2 stars if the facilities are great?  STAY AWAY FROM THE PERSONAL TRAINING OFFERED BY THE GYM.  I have been trying my best to get back into shape, but I didn't want to hurt myself and didn't really know what I should be doing.  So when you sign up you get a free evaluation.  I went through that with a very nice trainer and decided to hire them for personal training.    1. Be aware if you hire them the person you meet with the first time will not be your trainer and you will have to go over everything again on your own dime with the "new" trainer.  2. No one is responsible at the gym for your personal training if you have an issue no one has any idea what is going on.  My personal trainer only showed up 50% of the time; with the gym only notifying me one time of an issue.  You show up and the personal trainer won't and you have no recourse.  They just put you with a new one which is in no way effective.  There appears to be no way to get your money back from them even if they are at fault and have poor service.  So basically if you know what you are doing  they have a beautiful gym.

Been a long time since I updated my review for LT.  I had a fairly bad experience when I first signed up and got personal training, but I kept going after I received a refund. Then I took about 8 months off to road bike and be outside more.  Recently I decided to join back up and the facilities are still pretty great and seems much better than the other options in the area.    When I left for a few months there was no big deal since there are no contracts and they were running a special for New Years so signing back up was free.  All of the equipment is in good shape and runs well.  The restaurant is pretty good to grab something healthy on your way in or out of the gym.  It's nice to be able to hit the gym and grab lunch or a smoothie all in the same place.  There are plenty of lockers and they offer pretty much anything you can think of all included in your membership.  I'm deducting one star for the previous bad PT, but other than that it's a great place to work out.

This is a similar restaurant to Moe's and Chipotle.  I would say they are all interchangeable. Although I like the salsa bar that Moe's has and the others don't.  They have Shredded Pork (Carnitas)  which is always a plus for me.  The first time I had the pork it was great, the second time it was mushy, but very edible either way.  I would stay away from the steak, I found it rubbery. They have excellent Guacamole and Queso dip and chips.  EDIT: 10/17/2008  I went back the other day and had the Mexican Gumbo.  This dish alone moved them up to a 4 star from a 3 for me.  It's pretty fantastic and a very different menu item from the other quick burrito places.  If you want something like chili but a little lighter I highly recommend it.

This place has really gone down hill.  I had eaten here a few times and thought it was pretty good. Then we went for lunch and it was  incredibly busy one time we went for lunch with a 40 min wait so we decided to leave.   We went back a week or so later for dinner.  We had an incredibly long wait in the bar that seemed  to last forever even though there seemed to be plenty of tables on the patio.  They sat us inside in a very small room sandwiched in-between the kitchen and 3 large groups of very loud annoying people. There was only 2 of us not sure why were were relegated to such a terrible table.  Our food tasted terrible, oily, and the vegetables in my burrito were undercooked.  We didn't finish our dinner, paid and left. I have a pretty strong stomach, but both of us got extremely sick from the food after we left.   If you have to go here make sure you sit outside so you don;t get stuck in one the terrible side room.

I have tried several things here in the past few weeks and they have all been very good.  I don't eat a whole lot of Vietnamese food, but this place is real close to my neighborhood so that is always a plus.  They have made the restaurant bigger so there is plenty of seating although they due tend to be busy around lunch time.  The last few times they weren't breaking any records for speed even though my waitress was very nice.  I'm not sure this would be the best place if you are in a hurry. I appreciate the vegetarian options they have on the menu.  I thought the Vegetarian Pho was very good.  I haven't had many versions to compare it too, but it was much much better than the vegetarian versions I have had at the noodle shop downtown. The Tofu Vermicelli is really great.  it;s a cross between a hot noodle dish and a salad.  Which sounds kind of odd, but it's very good. They also have a pretty efficient take out so calling in and picking up isn't a problem.  Try:  - Vegetarian Pho. - Tofu Vermicelli

The food on my visits has been very good.  The Eggs Benedict Florentine is great they cooked the eggs perfectly and the hollandaise was just right.  They also have very good hash-browns so I haven't tried their other options.  The first time I went they were pretty busy, but our server was great and kept our coffee filled the whole time.  The second time we went our server spent more time chatting with some one sitting at the bar than refilling our coffee which was unfortunate.  The other complaint I have is the sun shades on the windows are very dirty and covered in dried food. So I would avoid sitting at the widow facing tables if you can.  The rest of the resturant seemed fine if they do something about the shades.

The best cheese steaks I have ever had and in Arizona no less.  The employees are always super friendly and cheerful. Which is impressive for how busy they are always ( a sure sign they are awesome ).  They have everything from authentic cheese steaks ( yes with cheese whiz)  to customized ones of your choosing.  If you don't like cheese whiz ( for shame ) just order it with "real" cheese.  I have had the chicken and steak sandwiches and they are both fantastic.  When you go try the Pizza Steak with mozzarella,mushrooms and pepperonis (it's heaven on a bun) with a side of sweet potato fries you won't regret it.

Unfortunately as of late the service has really gone down hill. I still think the coffee is great, when you can get it. If they are busy then they seem to really get the joe out, but if they aren't things slow to a crawl.  Not to mention they have messed up my order or my friend's order the last four times we have been there.  They apologize or say thanks for being patient although I never understand why we had to wait.  They seem to have enough staff maybe it's how they manage the preparation.  I had stopped ordering espresso drinks all together and just  get the cold brew since it comes out of the dispenser at the counter.  It's really a shame it used to be my favorite spot for coffee.

So here is a review for the bowling alley.  I think you probably know what to expect from a bowling alley, but here goes anyway.   Do they have cheap beer by the pitcher? Check.  Do they have an ample amount of bowling balls? Check.   Is the staff friendly? Check. Do they play cheesy music? Check.  This location is near my house so it gets and extra star since I can walk there and we always have fun.  If you live in the area it's a good bowling alley to go to and have a cold beer and bowl some frames.

Saw them awhile back on The Food Network and had been meaning to try the Toffee Bonafi Sundae.  It's a haul from my house, but I will have to say it was worth the drive.  There are few things that live up to what you think they will be in life and this is one of them. It's pretty much the perfect sundae and well worth the guilt.  I'm not a fan of candy and ice cream usually, but the toffee with almonds on this thing is pretty amazing.  The salted caramel and madagascar vanilla ice cream are also even better than I imagined them to be.  The girl behind the counter was really nice and did a great job constructing my sundae. I felt guilty for half a second before I destroying it.  ( I quickly got over it. )     If you live far from Shea it's worth the drive.  If you live close by I feel for the gym time you need to put in.  Try:  - Toffee Bonafi

In the months since I have found this place I have eaten here more than once a week.  I think even if you are not vegetarian they have the best food on this side of town.  The staff are very nice and the orders are filled promptly whether you eat in or carry out.  I have brought all of my friends and family here it is so good.  We have a  running joke that you can just point to the menu and get something.  The real standouts to try are:  - Gobi Manchurian - deep fried cauliflower - Chenna Batura - Chickpea Curry - Spring Dosa - rice and lentil crepes - Potato Bonda - breaded potato dumplings like samosas.  The place isn't super fancy. It's a simple strip mall restaurant with really friendly people.  I don't find this place very expensive and you get a ton of food wether you eat in or carry out ( I've done both many times ). Only one word of caution some of the stuff can be very spicy some days :)  So be a little adventurous and try one of the dishes above I don't think you will be disappointed.

Another one visit review....  Well I'm not sure when I will get back and I really liked this place so I will give them a shout out.  If you close your eyes and picture a Vegetarian Restaurant it's pretty much exactly like that.  The best way to describe it is very "Granola" with bright purple.  Since they sell tea the whole restaurant smells very much like a Chai Tea.  Which is very inviting and pretty nice.  The waitress I had was very nice and even though she was running around to all the tables was very efficient.   My lunch consisted of Water Melon gazpacho which when I was informed it was the special for the day I figured it would be really bad or really good. Luckily it was very good. Pretty much the perfect food for a 108 degree arizona day.  The Rawvacado wrap I had with it was very tasty and super fresh.  I highly recommend them both.  I also had a very cool Iced Chai Java tea.  I had never heard of it, but it is the wild cousin of and Iced Chai Tea with coffee thrown in.  I had one there and one to go it was that good.  When I am back on this side of town I will definitely stop back by.  Try: - Rawvacado Wrap - Iced Chai Java Tea - Watermelon gazpacho

My dog seems to always like going here to be groomed, which is as good a compliment as I can give.  The owners are always very friendly and Bailey looks like a show dog when they get through. It's a bit of a drive for me now, but I would't consider taking him anywhere else at this point. I have never had to board him I have only had the grooming services, but if I had to leave him to be boarded I would.

I really like this neighborhood restaurant. They have a pretty extensive menu of options or you can just build your own.  I usually stick with an egg based one for breakfast.  The Cheese Avocado & Mushroom add Egg is my personal favorite. They are a good size and service is pretty prompt. The staff is nice and make pretty good espresso drinks in the times I have .  I usually always get a mocha and they are quite good. It has a comfortable atmosphere  and plenty of room to sit down and take a break.  I'll have to come by and try them for lunch even though I usually stick to breakfast :)  Try: - Cheese Avocado & Mushroom + egg - Mocha

This place is great, too bad it's so far from me.  The restaurant is very english pub like.  With cool bench seating, a big patio, and a big counter to sit down and enjoy your pasty.  They are always playing an eclectic mix of music that I think adds to the charm.  The staff are really nice and check on you to make sure you have enough to drink and are enjoying yourself.  They get extra bonus points for having a huge selection of vegetarian and vegan pasty. Who doesn't want a savory turnover with delicious fillings? I have really enjoyed lunch here the few times I have gone.  I'll be bringing some friends with me next time.  Keep up the good work.  Try: - Eggplant Parm - Oggie - Greek

Yelp lead me here while my car's AC was being checked down the street. I had breakfast here and it was very good.  This place as a fun vibe that reminds me of back east.  I will stop in again if I am on that side of town.  Try:  - French Toast

I'm not sure about the other locations as I don't go here very often, but in the 3 times I have tried to go here they are pretty awful.  In all 3 times I have been here they didn't seem to know what was going on and never get my coffee order correct.  Maybe the menu is too complicated and there are too many coffee drinks that seem to have different names than all the other coffee establishments in the area.  Anyway pretty much anyplace else around here is better than this place.

I had takeout from here before the owners changed and it was pretty decent.  Since the ownership changed I have been twice.  The first time it was pretty busy and the pizza was ok but nothing special. Most of it hangs out precooked Sabarro style waiting to be reheated. On the second visit the restaurant was pretty dead and the manager completely ignored me while sitting on a little chair behind the counter.  With 4 people back in the kitchen that is pretty weird.  When I got tired of being ignored. I just went next door to get some food. They don't even get points for quick pizza even though it is all precooked and hanging out in the window and they just reheat it.

Since this place is in a large shopping center there is a ton of parking.  I am always a bit leery when I go in for dinner and there is no one else in the restaurant and the owner/manager/server is watching TV and Reading a news paper. The restaurant is ok if a bit cluttered and Asian Grocery store feeling when you come in.  I ordered the Pad See Ewe and my friend ordered Thai Green Beans. Unfortunately they were completely out of green beans... which just seemed odd.  The Pad See Ewe was ok, not really enough broccoli for my taste and not very flavorful or spicy. Can't say I would really recommend this one.

Another year another review.  I've been going here for over two years now and it's still one of my favorite breakfast spots in Ahwatukee.  The restaurant has changed things up from time to time for the better and they always have great food.  The staff is always cheerful in the morning and they make a great mocha.  The also get bonus points for having an actual "large" mocha.  It's been awhile since I ate lunch or dinner here, but I'll have to scoot by for happy hour and update this review.  The breakfast menu has been updated to add a few new things and keep the old favorites.  I highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros Verde it's my usual go to breakfast and the best I have found so far anywhere in Phoenix.  The verde sauce is great ( not really spicy though ) and the Oaxaca cheese filled tortilla is delicious. If you aren't in the mood for eggs the "Hit the Spot" pancakes are a huge portion and really good.  Order the hash browns crispy though as they tend to be on the limp side if you don't. They have plenty of tables, a counter, and an outside patio for dining.   Try: - Huevos Rancheros Verde - Mocha - "Hit the Spot" Pancakes - Croque Madame

Took my car here last summer to get the A/C fixed.  They replaced the fan for me and saw that my radiator was leaking so they let me know that I might be in for more serious care trouble if I didn't have it fixed.  I mistakenly the tiny puddle in the garage floor was just condensation from the A/C system.  They ordered the parts and had me going in a couple days.  They are great to work with and explained everything and gave me several options.  The A/C and car have been running great ever since.  They are my first choice if I have car issues in the future.  Note:  They moved the office to the left of the parking lot a few months ago, but they are still in the same location.

Yet another good review for Garcia's Windows & More. I usually trust Yelp till I am proven wrong and I figured the five star reviews couldn't be that out of line. You would never think leaky windows in Arizona would be an issue, but then you have never seen the monsoons. The cost of repairs to my leaky window  were very reasonable and they fixed the window quickly all in one visit.  Mark is a nice guy and seems to really know what he's talking about.  If you have window issues give him a call.  Update:  Lots of rain last night and the window is leak free.  So they are good guys.

When my big box store patio set fell apart I decided on Arizona Iron Furniture for a replacement set. This is really well built sturdy furniture that puts the aluminum and faux wicker junk to shame.  Most of the furniture is giant so my poor patio was out of luck, but the set I settled upon wound up being just the right fit.  The staff at the store and the delivery guys were all very nice and professional.  They have a ton of different fabrics to choose from and the maintenance of the furniture so far as been very easy and still looks great.  I highly recommend them for their outstanding service and quality furniture.

Another year has passed since my last review and the Pom is still the best restaurant around. Whether you are vegetarian, vegan or not this is a wonderful place to get some grub. The entire staff is incredibly friendly and helpful whenever I venture in for breakfast or lunch.  There are lots of new faces here now, but the service and friendly vibe are all still in full force. They always seem to know everyone. They have a dedicated following, but they are just as nice to new comers. I try and bring all of my friends and family even though none are vegetarian.   They have seriously killer breakfast foods. The top being the Lumber Jack Sandwich though their breakfast specials have never disappointed me. Be on the lookout for their special pancakes and the vegetarian "Sausage Biscuits" and gravy. My personal favorite lunch food is the RAW Tacos which have walnut taco meat ( yeah I know it's still fantastic).  They are the offspring of amazingly delicious mexican food and a salad.  If you don't know what to get just ask. They are always super helpful at explaining things and making great suggestions or just get something from the vegan desert case everything is awesome.  Try:  - Lumber Jack Sandwich - RAW Tacos - Mocha - Breakfast Specials - Passion Juice - Chocolate Banana Muffins - Snickers Bars - Hummus

Excellent coffee drinks.  I got my mocha to go and they even took the time to make the cool foam design on it even though it was soon covered by the to-go top.  Very friendly staff and I was in and out in a flash.  What more could you want?  Try: - Mocha

When I ate here with some friends in the middle of the afternoon we were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant.  We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.  They were pretty dead so you would think they would want to keep the travel distance to a minimum.  Another group was seated about 10 minutes later across the room from us and they actually had the server move them.  The food was just average at best.  Nothing really stood out on the menu when we were ordering. I got a pretty tasteless Portabella/Goat Cheese salad.  The service we pretty slow, but it might have just been due to the 30 minute hike to our table.  Maybe I'll have to come back by for breakfast.

For Breakfast:  Well I decided to try Chompies for breakfast today and I got portobellas again so I must be a gluten for punishment.  I was actually seated in the front today which was cool and my waitress was very nice, but the eggs benedict was not what I was expecting.  The Portobello Benedict is more expensive than all but the one with lox which was kinda sad since I am vegetarian.  They have departed from the standard eggs benedict with not a appealing result.  It comes on a bagel that is supposed to be toasted which is wasn't. So it was cold and chewy and a whole lot of bread in comparison to the rest of the toppings. They also decided to add cheese to all of the different combos which when you combine it with the hollandaise is not a good thing.  And there were only two tiny pieces of mushroom on the whole plate.... so I am not sure what I was charged extra for. Very disappointing there are far better eggs benny in the area ( see my other reviews )  Maybe this place is just not for vegetarians.  If you do go and order the eggs benedict do yourself a favor and get the english muffin ( tell them to toast it ) and skip the cheese.  For Lunch:  When I ate here with some friends in the middle of the afternoon we were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant.  We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.

Their truck was mentioned on YELP talk by Anthony and lo and behold they were in the parking lot of the Four Peaks Tasting room last night.  First off I will note I am vegetarian so I am only reviewing the veggie dogs but they were spectacular.  I had the Aiko ( Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo + added sirracha), Igby  (Coleslaw and crumbled Bleu Cheese drizzled with tangy BBQ sauce) and we shared a side of fried pickles.  By far my favorite is the Igby and I wasn't that big of a fan of coleslaw before I had it even.  It's a perfect blend of crunchy, tangy, and sweet. The staff running the truck are extremely nice, friendly and very fun to chat with while I waited for the food. They made excellent suggestions so ask them what they think if you can't decide.  You are doing yourself a disservice by not tracking them down ASAP.  TRY: - Igby - Aiko

There isn't much to add on this place.  It's just a really awesome ice cream shop.  That is way different than anything else around here.  The popsicles actually have pieces of the ingredients in them so you aren't wondering if it's just over priced frozen drink mix.  I had the Blackberry Lavender popsicle and it was very good and had chunks of blackberry in it.  My sister's Banana's Foster popsicle was even better.  I will probably get that next time.  The only disconcerting thing is the bite mark, ha.  It's very real looking... we both looked at each other and wondered if it was supposed to be there, but they all have them so it's part of the mold.  The girl getting ice cream for everyone was really nice and helpful.  A really outstanding place.  If you are in downtown chandler definitely go by and get one.  Try:  - blackberry  - bananas foster

Another breakfast place I hadn't tried on Ray!  I am glad they added an "Open" sign on the reflective sun screening on the windows.  It was hard to tell if the place was actually serving people or not as you drive by so I had skipped stopping in a few times before I tired it.  The place is a bit like a "Momma's Family" episode as I think they lifted the design from the set.  Our waitress was exceptionally nice and recommended the German Style Pancakes. I am pretty sure I have never had one before, but it's way different than the normal pancakes served for breakfast. It's a cross between a soufflé, pancake, and crepe.  It's delicious and you don't feel like you have eaten way too much after downing it all with your coffee.  I recommend stopping by and trying one.  Try:  - German Pancakes

Maybe it's because I am from the east coast, but I don't see the love for In-N-Out burgers.  Since everyone is comparing them here is my 2 cents. Five Guys Burgers are hand formed and taste way more like beef than the thin tiny burgers at In-N-Out.  You can also get pretty much any topping you can think of at Five Guys.  The real stand out is the fries.  I recommend getting them with Cajun as that makes them truly amazing.  No matter what size fires you get they give you a ton of them.  More than enough to share. For what you get I don't see how Five Guys is really that more expensive than any of the other burger places around here.  A "regular" burger here is a double patty burger and very large.  I usually get a small burger and that's just fine.

Went here for lunch the other day after hiking on South Mountain.  It feels like a slightly nicer Subway restaurant when you walk in, the place is very brightly decorated and cheery.  THe reason I am writing this review is for the Farm hot pressed panini.  FIrst off it's not technically a panini more like hot toasted sandwich.  I had never had a squash sandwich before, but it was really good.  The break was toasty and fresh and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  If you are near this place for lunch stop in and have one.  The price is a bit on the high side for a sandwich shop, but it was really good.  Try:  - The Farm Sandwich

I am a big fan of Pad See Ewe and Tasty Thai makes a very good version. They serve an excellent salad as an appetizer during lunch. The restaurant is nice inside it has the same decor as of most of the other thai places here in the valley. It's a small place with a bar and dining room "cozy" would probably be the appropriate word.  The waiter we had for lunch was a nice guy and didn't mind us bringing in fast food for my nephew which is always appreciated as he has not developed a love of thai just yet.  I will deffinately be back to try the rest of the menu.

This place is a bit of a drive from my house, but so far it seems worth it.  I have had excellent and quick service on my visits. It's a very nice restaurant with friendly staff.  I have only gotten the Benedict Florentine for breakfast as it was so good I haven't switched up.  My eggs were poached well just enough hollandaise sauce and the marinated portabella mushrooms are great.  Special mention for the potatoes that come with them.  It's not your run of the mill hash-browns.  They are skin on baked russet potatoes with onions and they are delicious.  I will be back.  They even have a drive through to call in and get breakfast to go, very cool.  Try:  - Benedict Florentine - The Potatoes

I think this place has really settled in since it opened. They have a set menu now that is smaller than the Mesa and Phoenix location, but I really have enjoyed everything I have had there.  The food is very spicy so be warned.  Even the salsa they give you is usually very very hot.   The two owners are usually working the restaurant during lunch and they have always greeted me and been very social and fun.  They seem to really like the place and want you to have a good time.  On the weekends make sure you call for reservations and you should have no problem with seating.  I took some friends there one friday night and I didn't get our servers name, but she was very entertaining and made the whole night a blast.  Things to try: - Guacamole ( A +++) - Chile Reno ( my favorite )

I'm moving them up to a 5 star review.  I had family in for Christmas and we all decided to go out for Lunch the day after christmas.  We had a group of 9 ( with 4 kids ) and the service was terrific and they all really enjoyed the Spinach Pizza.  The picky kids even enjoyed their wings, spaghetti and pizza.  This is a great pizza place.  I have gotten carry out, delivery and eaten in quite a few times.  The restaurant is very nice and above average for your normal pizza place around here.  They have two things that make it a cut above most pizza anywhere.  The first thing is the spinach pizzas. If you don't like spinach stay away, but if you do, it's a real treat. The other gut busting thing to try if you are really hungry is the Baked Spaghetti Calzone. If that sounds awesome to you then yes it's that amazing.  It's a carb overload, but so worth it.  Try: - Baked Spaghetti Calzone ( Add Ricotta ) - Mamma Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Spinach Pizza - L'Italiana Pizza

I hadn't been to Mark's since the remodel. It happens to be just outside of my normal breakfast route, but I was close by today so I stopped in.  I actually had no idea they had the big redo till I asked the waitress if they had changed names. She had waited on me my previous visit so I had a feeling it was the same place.  They had a community renovation project to help them out, Awesome.  Anyway the updated decor is a good improvement and makes the place feel better and more comfortable.  They were packed this morning which was nice to see and I got my coffee straight away from being seated at the new bar counter area.  The staff was extremely nice and friendly even though they were really busy  so that gets a big thumbs up from me.  I had the California Eggs Benedict which is a step up from the usual Eggs benedict Florentine by adding avocado and tomato.  It was very good and my eggs were cooked perfectly with a very nice hollandaise sauce.  They do have strong diner coffee that will definitely wake you up which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference for coffee.  Glad too see this place doing so well. I will definitely be back sooner this time.  I think I will be adding them to my normal breakfast route.  Keep up the good work.  Try:  - California Eggs Benedict

I visited global bike to buy a new bike helmet, but ended up buying a Specialized Road Bike in addition.  The staff here are really nice and I had wanted a road bike so I decided to just go for it. Charlene helped me pick out a bike and has definitely forgotten more about bikes then i will probably ever know.  She had no problem with me trying out about ten different bikes ( there is a neighborhood you can shoot over too that let you get a feel for them) and answered a ton of questions while I tried to decide.  I like sales people who don't pressure you  and let you make up your own mind.  Charlene also did a fit for my road bike after I purchased it which i was surprised at how much better the bike feels and responds after that.  All in all A++ experience and I would highly recommend getting a bike from them.  If you are in doubt ask for Charlene.

This is from a vegetarian visiting so take this with a grain of salt.  I stopped by to try the veggie burger since I was craving some onion rings.  Their veggie burger comes super vegetabled-out with sprouts and cucumbers even as a vegetarian I'm not that big of a fan of cucumbers and sprouts on a burger so I got it with cheese and left off the previously mentioned.  It was pretty dry and over cooked as veggie burgers go with nothing special going on.  If restaurant  is going to have one on the menu at least try to make it better than the freezer section ones.  They must be doing well though I had to wait a really long time for my food even on off hours.  They were busy but they didn't seem slammed for the wait I had.  The onion rings were kinda greasy and the breading was falling off so the main reason I came was a bummer as well.  They might be good for the carnivores, but I would skip it if you are a vegetarian and want a burger fix.

Excellent place to see live music.  This place is in a great location. Easy walking distance from other stuff downtown.  The bouncers have always been very friendly with us on our visits. The staff at the door and bar have been cool.  It's a new place with plenty of room for the acts who play there. They have bleacher seating, tables, and standing room. They have pretty good sound equipment that so far seems to work as expected.  I highly recommend it.

I have only eaten here once, but I have to say I was impressed enough to write a review.  I am a huge fan of breakfast and I have to say I was very happy with my visit. The decor, layout, and location are pretty awesome. The choice of music playing was also near and dear to my heart as I think they ripped off my iPhone playlist while I was there, that is a personal preference I know, but music alone would be 5 stars. The group I was with got kids pancakes, sandwiches and omelets and they all looked great and tasted wonderful.  Most breakfast food does't come out plated so well.  Not that it is necessary, but it shire is a welcome surprise.  My Mocha was excellent.  My only minor qualm is that the staff seem to think you have eaten there before and are not very helpful with the menu when you order.  The staff that brought out our food and checked on us were awesome, so I don't really knock it for that.  I will definitely be back.  Try:  * Greek Omelet  * Killer Breakfast Sandwich  * Mocha

My last few visits here are been sub-par.  I used to really love this place even though it's always crazy busy.  The last time two times I ordered the "Farmer's Market" the eggs were completely hard-boiled and it was served cold. With how busy they are, I am not sure how that happens. So I switched up to the "House Request" sandwich and there was about a 1/2 lb of cream cheese on it which is not very appetizing. After I scrapped most of it off it wasn't bad, but I had also obliterated the sandwich.  Maybe I have just had a run of bad luck so I'll stop by a few more times when I get time and see if it was just a run of bad luck.

This is a really great restaurant that has to over come some unfortunate location issues.  If you are traveling down Mcclintock then it is hidden behind a vacant Mexican / fast food restaurant.  If you are traveling down Broadway it is hidden behind a very large BK.  I know I have driven by many a time and never seen this place.  The parking lot is very rough and needs to be paved in a bad way.  The restaurant is the complete opposite of it's surroundings.  It is very bright and contemporary inside.  A very pleasant dining room with very cool decor.  The staff is really nice and the menu is pretty varied.  My only complaint would be it needs a few more vegetarian options.  Next time I go in I'll ask if there are any recommendations.  I had the vegan tamales on my lunch visit and they were outstanding.  They come in three flavors, but the Jalapeno Hummus ones were the best.  I know hummus in a tamale sounds weird but they were very good.  They have a really good vegan artichoke  dip/sauce I wouldn't have believed it was vegan.  Next time you pass by give them a try.  Try: - Vegan Tamales

There are much better options for breakfast than this place.  The food is ok but lacked salt. So if you are going for a low sodium diet you are all set.  My first visit was fine nothing special would have given it a 3.  I would recommend not going in after 1PM.  I went in at 1:30pm and there was nobody there to seat me as they were chatting at a table off to the side.  I was seated after a few minutes, when he noticed I was waiting. The booth where I was seated didn't seem to have a waitress assigned to it...  Everyone was clearing tables and huddled in the back.  I waited 10 Minutes then decided they wanted to close so I left and went to get food elsewhere.

This place is a really great idea. It's $2 for a good cookies and ice cream.  I don't really think it matters that it's Dreyer's ice cream.  It tastes good and they advertise it all over the store so they aren't hiding anything.  The owners are very nice and my Reese's Cookie and chocolate ice cream was great.

I'll chime in and give this location a ratings boost.  The main thing they have going for them is their drive-thru.  They always seem to move people through really quickly.  The other location down on Chandler Ave always has a much longer line.  They have a nice patio and lots of places to sit inside.  I have never had a poorly made mocha here and the staff has always been very friendly.   I have never had an issue with service when going through the drive-thru and the few times I have gone in they were equally pleasant and efficient.   Not sure what all the hate is for.  If you are on Ray this is a pretty great location.

This place is a bit far from my house, but unlike the stores closer by they seem to have any and every part you can imagine for remote control cars.  I needed a part and the 2 other places I called had never even carried it, but I called up Hobbytown and they found it for me and held it till I got there.  So in the long run it saved me more time.  The next time I broke the front wheel and suspension and headed over without calling and they helped me find and they had all the parts I needed to get back up and running.  The staff are definitely helpful and as far as I can tell know what they are doing.  I'll definitely be back.

This review is mainly for the ice cream and onion rings since I am a vegetarian. They have very good sundaes  and shakes.  If you decide to get a malt tell them to go easy on the malt powder they tend to do it 50/50 which is way too much for anyone.  The restaurant is new so it's clean and they have a good sized patio to enjoy the AZ weather.  The staff on my visits have always been very  nice and helpfull.  In our group they even made up a free shake for us to try that wasn't on the menu without charge. I had a surrogate tester try the butter burger and he gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up.  So if I ever go back to the dark side I will re-review with a burger addition.  Try: - carmel/cashew sundae - Shakes - Malts ( Go easy on the malt ) - * Butter Burger   * Surrogate Tester Approved

This is not my type of burger. I'm not even sure it was beef.  It comes out with a weird beef/grease netting like texture. That is incredibly thin and dried out. I guess they get points for being different, just not my cup of tea.  The food is incredibly salty and greasy. Which I guess can be expected, but it seemed overly so to me.  In didn't try the ice cream while I was there, but it looked pretty good.

This place doesn't look like much from the outside it's one of the couple of restaurants that have been converted over in Phoenix from existing buildings, but that shouldn't deter you from stopping by.  The inside is completely renovated and has an updated and friendly feel to it.  The staff is pleasant and very helpful for newbies and seem to really appreciate their customers. I also give them extra points for having breakfast during lunch hours.  I can have breakfast any hour of the day so they are on the right track.  My sister and I got takeout for lunch and mu Spinach/Feta/Mushroom frittata was excellent even after it had travelled back home with me.  They have great hashbrowns that are slightly seasoned and cooked expertly and a welcome change from the run of the mill plain Jane potatoes places usually serve with breakfast.  They have limited parking ( as do the other places near here ) so if you park on the side street save yourself some time and walk down the sidewalk.  We tried to cut through the middle alley and it doesn't exit into the parking lot.  We'll be back.  Try: Spinach/Feta/Mushroom Frittata.

I don't get by here often, but they do make very good Mochas.    The real stand out to this particular location ( and most of the others ) is the staff.  They are all consistantly happy, energized, and entertaining.  I guess drinking and making coffee all day makes you a happy person.  It's one of the better places to get coffee.  Try:  - Mocha

Time to update my review for this great Dutch Brothers location on Rural & Guadalupe.  They are pretty busy in the mornings, but usually send out of of the incredibly friendly staff to keep the orders moving.  Much like I stated in my last review the staff always seems to be in a great mood whenever I come by which has made me frequent this location much more often than I used too.  Not sure if they drink lots of coffee while they work or they just hire really awesome people, but whatever it is it seems to work out. The added bonus is the coffee is fantastic.  The only downside to this location is if there is a ton of people you can't really get into the parking lot from Rural to place your order.  This is one of the best locations on this side of the valley to get coffee.  Keep up the good work.

This is a great little restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and service was top notch.  They have a lunch buffet, but I opted for Chana Masala ( Chick Pea Curry )  instead for my lunch.  It was very good and a pretty large size portion.  I would recommend it.  I also ordered the Chili Naan ( they have many different kinds ) it's basically Naan covered in Sriracha or some other chili paste.  It was pretty hot so be warned if you order it.  It also had what I thought was kind of a charred back to it, but it went really well with the Chana Masala so I'll go with that it being intentional.  Try: - Chana Masala - Mali Kofta

Nice to have a closer Pita Jungle.  This location is missing the Pond they have at the other location past the 101 on Ray Road, but it has a much bigger patio which is always a good thing.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty big and a little more modern than the other Pita Jungles.  The staff was very nice and efficient on my visit.  Since they have only been open two weeks I think that is a very good sign.   This is a busy shopping center so the parking isn't as great as you would assume it to be. A special note to the Minivan that parked in the compact spot next to me, your car is not a compact.  Try:  - Nachos! - Ginger Stir Fry - Lavosh Pizza  - Hummus

What a great company.  I had previously tried to replace the rollers in my sliding door without much luck.  So when my door became too bad to deal with I turned to Yelp.  I called and talked to Heather who was very nice and explained all the costs for coming out to check out my door up front.  Dave called me back shortly after and came out the same day and right on time.  He's a great guy and had my door fixed very quickly and now works great. I regret waiting so long to get it sorted out.  Don't hesitate to call them if you door is driving you nuts.

I usually don't review places till I have eaten there a few times, but I really liked our new italian restaurant so I thought I would give them some love.  I had never eaten at any of the other locations and I was not really sure what to expect. I went for lunch ( as usual ) on Wednesday.  They weren't very busy so that seemed like it might be a bad sign, but the hostess seated me right away and my food came out very quickly.  The place is nice, very contemporary not the usual cheesy italian motif.   Like others have said they get special consideration for having quite a few vegetarian options.  Most italian places seem to only have one or two.  I had the lunch special with a pasta and salad combo.  The Mista salad was very good and I highly recommend it.  The only drawback is that it was severed on a very tiny plate.  I think the portion size was good for a lunch combo, it was just hard to eat without getting lettuce all over the table.  I also got the pasta Vaducci and it was a little heavy on the sun dried tomatoes and light on the olives, but still tastey.   They also have very good bread that seems like they make it in house, bravo.  So in summary : great wait staff,  bread, salad and pasta.  Not sure what else you could want.  i'll be back  Try:  - Mista Salad - Pasta Vaducci

This place has remained pretty high on my list of places to eat so here's an updated review.  It has a very large amount of pasta choices that can mostly all be made vegetarian which is pretty great. Taking people here from out of town seems to make everyone happy which is always nice. The service has always been quick and extremely nice here.  Even if they are a bit busy it isn't a very long wait to get severed and drink refills.  The break they give you with your meal is fresh and not the  overly loaded with garlic butter variety.  it's still bread, but it seems a bit better than most Italian places.  They have a great lunch option where you get pasta and a salad. It's quick and much better than fast food.  Try:  - Pasta Rustica - Pasta Valducci

Lindsey and her dog sitters watched my crazy cattle dog Zoe while I was out of town for two weeks. The only way to summarize her service is awesome.  They were all nice, professional  and they didn't have any issues with Zoe. Which in and of itself is amazing. I was worried she was going to be too much trouble for anyone to watch for me.  They sent daily updates and photos to my phone so I didn't have to worry about her at all. When I returned home from my trip Zoe even had a stack of report cards on the counter so I knew exactly how everything went. They even left her a Christmas gift of dog biscuits. I really am grateful and if you are looking for someone to watch your pets at home instead of kenneling them then look no further.

This beer festival is always a great time.  The location is really nice at the Scotsdale Civic Center. There are plenty of trees to hang out under while trying all the awesome beers and it's never obnoxiously crowded.  The beer/event staff are always cheerful to those wandering around trying all the beers. They also have plenty of food trucks and live music to keep you happy all afternoon long. The only minor negative has to be the beer servers are just hired to hand out beer and to that end some some of them don't know a whole lot about the beer you are trying.  Which isn't a huge deal you either like it or not I guess.  If there is one beer festival to check out in the Phoenix area it is this one. It's always a good, good time.

This place makes a mean breakfast "burrito".  It's actually made from a crepe instead of a tortilla ( go figure ).  I ordered it without bacon which would have probably made it even better.  The crepe was light and airy stuffed full of eggs, mexican cheese, and avocado, and fresh salsa.  If you are near by for breakfast stop and get one.  I had a very good Iced Mocha to wash it down.  So good food and coffee seems like a winner to me.  The cashier was very friendly and they had no problem with my substitution which is always nice.   Try: - Breakfast burrito - Mocha

Yet another place my review is horribly out of date for.  The Crepe Bar is such a fantastic place to go for breakfast ( I should really go for lunch ).  They are small ( but expanding! ) so sometimes it gets a bit crazy there, but it's definitely a friendly neighborhood spot that you just kinda flow with the wait times. They are the farthest thing from a fast food restaurant and the pride they take in what they do is very welcome. Their entire staff are incredibly nice and the few times I have had an issue ( I order the burrito without bacon, I know crazy! ) they have been accommodating and extremely nice. If you ever have an issue do yourself a favor and just say something. They go out of their way to make you happy in my experience. They also bring out cool gastronomic treats for you to try while you wait for your food.  I can safely say most of them I have never even seen before, but are always delicious. I am a creature of habit so I stick with the Breakfast Burrito no Bacon when I go for breakfast. They have changed it up a few times over the years and it just gets better and better. It one of my top things to have for breakfast in the valley. Their coffee is always exceptional., The expresso drinks take a bit of time when they get slammed.  They really take pride in their production, but it is very much worth it if that is your thing. If you are in a bit of a rush the cold brew coffee is excellent and quite a bit faster.  TRY:  - Breakfast Burrito Crepe - Cold Brew - Expresso Drinks

Desert Roots is a great little place for a fast lunch.  Since everything is vegan it's one of the best choices in Tempe for something healthy.  Everything I have tried has been really good and satisfying.  The salads and hummus are always fresh and server up deli style from the case. So it's really quick to stop in eat on the patio and head back about your day.  The staff is exceptionally nice and helpful giving you suggestions of things to try and what they have for the day.  It's a little hard to find at first since it's in a back nook off the street, but well worth it once you know here it is.  If you are curious about vegan food or just want something not fried for lunch this is pretty much the best place on Mill.

4.5 Stars  This is a pretty amazing place for the beer enthusiast. WOB has an amazing selection of beers on tap and in bottles.  There are quite a few things I have never heard or seen on tap which is always a pleasant surprise.  The staff on our few visits have been very nice and helpful suggesting beers from the huge menu.  They lose a 1/2 star only for the fact that they have no food at all in the place.  I appreciate that they just want to have beer which is great, but they really need pretzels, beer nuts, fries, wings, something.  They are right next to Five Guys so we usually do rock, paper, scissors and send someone over to get fries.  This is a great place just needs snacks or eat before you go.

Fate is one of my favorite Micro Breweries in Phoenix. They have great pizza for a quick bite at lunch. The Mediterranean is excellent with just the right amount of kalamata olives.  The salad I had was great with blue cheese and candied pecans with sunflower seeds.  The real stand out for me is their unique beers they make and tap.  The Candy Bar Stout is just as awesome as it sounds brewed with peanuts, vanilla, and coco nibs. If you drop in to get a growler they have it on tap with nitrous and it's amazing.  The bartenders are always very friendly and willing to answer questions and fill up a growler to go. If you a re in the mood for a more standard beer check out the belgian Dubbel it's very good with everything.

Bob is great.  His wife Beth answers when you make appointments and she is very nice and helpful. They have installed outside lighting and run coax for me and did a terrific job.  They have reasonable rates and are very personable and professional. I highly recommend them if you need electrical work for your home.

Went here for a recent show and it was a mixed bag really. The bouncers and door staff were very pleasant and moved people in quickly.  The bartenders seemed cheerful and I got my cokes refilled quickly ( DD always ).  I'll agree the sound was muddy and the band requested for the sound engineer to adjust it, but it never really sounded as good as I had hoped. I have seen that band at several other venues around the city and the sound at all of them was much better.  My main complaint for this place is that it's really a sports bar that has bands and most of the people seem to want to be playing pool, darts, etc instead of listening to the band.  At the Crescent and Rhythm Room since all there is to do is listen to the music it's a much better venue and experience.  On our visit there was a large group of drunk people yelling for the first half of the show playing darts. No one that worked there seemed to care that we had Paid $20 to hear the band. You would expect that more from a place that doesn't sell tickets for a show. It was unfortunate hopefully it was an isolated incident.  If you come here to hang out and are not worried about the band you'll probably have a much better time.

Ordered takeout from here the other night and I was impressed.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We added a change to our takeout order when we got there and they quickly fixed us up.  They have a cool outside area that seems like it would be fun to hand out and have a beer and a taco when they get it all finished up.  My Bean Burrito "Terry's Style"  was really good,t hey have very good tortillas and they have excellent guacamole.  I'll be back by when I am on that side of town.  Try:  - Bean Burrito "Terry's Style" - Chips and Guacamole

This place seems to be home to bland mexican food that isn't that well prepared.  I have gone through the drive through and it took about 15 -20 minutes to get a cold Chile Reno Burrito with crunchy chiles.  We I ate in the service was fast, but my enchiladas and the sauce really had no flavor.  They need to work on the food prep and up the spice level to get anywhere close to the other options around here.

This is a pretty unique place to come and have a Four Peaks brew and hang out.  As others have said they don't serve any food, but they do have food trucks. I suggest going when the Short Leash Dogs truck is there.  They don't seem to mind customers ordering Pizza in or bringing their own food so I don't really see it as an issue.  The bartenders and the bouncers are friendly and add to the relaxed atmosphere.   In the corner  there is pretty much every board game you can think of to waste time with friends while enjoying your tasty beverage.  It's a great place to just grab a beer without having to wade through all the people at the much busier restaurant and brewery location.

Since seeing Monica O. frequent this place, I had to try it. The tacos are made to order so they are served hot and delicious. They do come "plain", but that is so you can build your perfect taco from the toppings bar. The toppings are always fresh and crispy and the salsa is actually spicy! The staff seem to work at both locations and they are very pleasant and helpful.   I have never had a bad lunch here. Although I usually go early as they get packed closer to normal lunch time with limited seating, but it's worth the wait or getting it to go.  The food is simple and fantastic keep up the good work.

I am a big fan of the America's Taco in Scotsdale so I was pretty happy they opened one closer to the house. I only get one thing here. The Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's way and Guacamole and chips so take what you will from that.  The vegetarian quesadilla really needs to be rethought.  It's a cheese quesadilla with a bunch of onions and lettuce.  The plain old cheese one is much, much better.  The Beans are lard free and very good and an excellent quick lunch if you are vegetarian.  The staff here are very nice and the food comes out quickly.  They even have the option to order online and just pick it up. I am deducting one star for the quesadilla and the fact they ran out of beans one day and they didn't tell me till after I had ordered.  I had to get the vegetarian quesadilla which wasn't a very good substitute.  Try: - Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's Way - Guacamole and Chips

This place is right near my house which is great!  It's funny everyone I talk too asks me where the heck it is.  It's located in an industrial park behind the Fudruckers with a little sign that says beer out front.  What more could you want?  It has no food much like a few of the other tap rooms in the area.  They do have a food truck on Friday, but you can order pizza and have it delivered.  I'm not sure how I didn't think of that.  The ladies that work behind the counter serving beer are all extremely nice and friendly while you are hanging out and enjoying your beer.  They even do a yoga class there which is pretty unique.  The beer selection is varied.  They make the beer for Papago so they have those beers, their beers and guest beers on tap so there should be something for just about everyone.  The real standout for me is the Rice Pudding Porter.  It is my favorite porter by a large margin with it's almost Chia Tea like quality.  Is they have the Grapefruit Radler get a 1/2 and 1/2 of it and the Magic in the Ivy IPA.  It's one of the best summer beer drinks you can have.  Try: Rice Pudding Porter Radler + magic in the ivy

Without a doubt this is the best place to get beer in the Phoenix area. They make fantastic beer that you will not find anywhere else in Arizona.  When we stop in there is always something delicious to try or something on the way to get you coming back.  The staff here are exceptional.  They make you feel right at home and are always friendly and  willing to explain the beers and talk about all the fun and exciting things they are working on.  They have a simple menu of things on a bun ( chicken, pulled pork, burgers or veggie burger ), but it hits the spot with an ice cold hand crafted beer.  I will go on record to say they have the best Black Bean veggie burger in the area. It's actually freshly made, no frozen garden burgers to be found.  All of the beer establishments and restaurants should take note on how to have a great place that you want to come back too.  Try:  - Signal Mountain Stout - Woosley Wit - Beer - Veggie Burger with Mushrooms and Beer Cheese - Veggie Burger with Green Chile, Cheddar, and BBQ sauce

This is a great place for fire oven pizza on this side of town.  The best thing about eating here has to be that you can put whatever you want on your pizza and it still costs the same.  They have pretty much every topping you can think of and they construct your 11" pizza right there with as little or as much as you can handle. Even the "premium" toppings others charge more for ( Kalamata olives Mmmmmm). The food is usually really fast even when they are kinda backed up which is nice when you are running out for a quick dinner.  The only slightly wonky thing is the way they mark your pizza on the papers.  This seems pretty straight forward, but when they get busy it sometimes becomes a bit hectic and you need to go check on your pizza.  That's only a minor quibble though.  They have been really nice when it has happened and even gave us a free pizza cookie coupon.  It's a pretty new place though so it will probably get all figured out as they go.    Try: - Pizza

The new Scotsdale location is everything I like about CPC cranked up to 11.  The location is bigger than the ones on University and in Mesa.  They have a good sized patio and a pretty spacious interior that is shiny and new. While still delivery some tasty pasty as always.  We stopped in for lunch the other day and the service was terrific.  The wait seems to be about on par with the other locations. It's not the quickest place to stop for something to eat, but it a great choice.  This location actually has appetizers on the menu which should help out a bit for those who are more impatient and or hungry.  Try : - Vegetarian Cottage Pie - Eggplant Parm

I finally found this place again after they moved!  It's a bit hard to find actually.  I had driven by it for weeks until I made the effort to figure out where it was.  They only have a banner in the window and the door is hidden behind an alcove on the end of the shopping center so it makes it pretty hard to see driving by.  They are in the Trader joe's shopping center on the opposite end.  Hopefully they are getting a new sign so that people can find them.  I will have to say they are 100% better in the new location.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, there is plenty of room and the food service time has been really fast the four or five times I have been. They keep the web site updated with their menu since it rotates from week to week which is always nice to be able to check before heading over.  Keep up the good work.  Try:  - Raw "PASTA" Marinara

Since moving to Arizona I have become addicted to Thai food.  There are so many choices here it's exciting to have a fantastic place move in so close to my house.  The staff here have worked in a few other Thai restaurants around the area so they have hit the ground running.  The service is fantastic.  It's the fastest place to grab a sit down lunch on this side of town with excellent food.  It's actually amazing how fast the food comes out and how delicious it is.  They have about everything you would want in a thai restaurant. The decor is very modern and clean, the soup and salad that come with lunch are always fresh, and they have great noodles dishes and curries.  They even have a new thing I have never seen before, Thai Fried Ice cream not to be confused by Mexican Restaurant fired ice cream.  It's like a hot fried donut filled with ice cream it's amazingly delicious.  If you are nearby stop in and give them a try.  They are closed from 3PM to 5PM during the day as a heads up, but not unusual for thai restaurants around here.  Try:  - Pad See Ewe - Drunkin Noodles - Thai Fried Ice Cream!

It's been over a year since my last review and at current count I have eaten here 65 times.  To say I like this place is an understatement. It is by far my favorite place to go to lunch. The staff here is exceptional. In all the times I have come here for lunch I have never once had bad service or bad food. I can't speak for how authentic the food is since I have never been to Thailand. My Thai food experience is limited to restaurants here in the states, but I haven't found any better than here. It has the added bonus of being extremely close to my house and 95% of the time the food is served way faster than you would think possible. If they are super slammed for lunch then it can take a bit of time occasionally, but they have soup and salad while you wait.  I am a huge fan of noodle dishes and they have my favorite Drunken Noodles and Pad See Ew.  TRY: - Drunken Noodles - Pad See Ew - Fried Thai Ice Cream

So last week I was getting tacos and this popped up on Yelp. I was a bit confused since I live on the other end of the block and never noticed this place. Once I found, it became clear how I had driven past it every day and not noticed. There are only two very small stickers on the doors that say Doc's and three tables with umbrellas out front to lure in customers.  I will have to say I am extremely glad I found them.  Much like everyone else has said Doc and his staff are are extremely nice and very helpful. If that wasn't enough the ice cream is fantastic. I can't remember any I have had that is even close to quality and taste.  They have some very unusual flavors and the sorbet is made from coconut milk and coconut cream which is very delicious and different.  There isn't much more to say other than get off Yelp and go give them a visit.  You will not be disappointed.

I will start this off by saying I hate the ordering system at these type of restaurants. So that taints my opinion a bit.  They do the same thing at Paradise Bakery where they make you stand in a crazy long line and wait behind everyone that is ordering some random thing. If you don't want a salad then why do I have to wait behind the four people that have no idea what they want on theirs?  If I want soup can I just skip them? It seems rude so I never do I just wait.  The veggie quinoa soup I ordered was 25% quinoa and 50% salt.  I was glad I got a sandwich or I wouldn't have had anything to eat.  My California Turkey sandwich was pretty good. I liked the smashed avocado as you get a lot more than the few measly slices they give you other places.  All in all this place is just not my cup of tea.

If you have a cake craving go here.  Their cakes are some of the best I have ever had. They have mini-bundt cakes so you don't actually have to buy a whole cake so you can feel better about it.  Do yourself a favor and get the white chocolate raspberry bunt cake. It tastes like a really amazing cousin of a jelly doughnut.  Great place even if it makes you feel a bit guilty  Try: - White Chocolate Raspberry Cake ( A +++ )

It's probably a bad thing this place is so close to my house. I go every week at least once for shrimp now. I think it's not in the best spot since they don't seem very busy when I go for lunch. Let's hope Yelp will send more people their way in the future.  I have never ordered the bar-be-que here and I am not sure with the other choices in the valley why they even have that as an option. It just seems to make the restaurant overly smokey.  The real reason to go is to get the seafood. They sell it by the pound with whatever choice of spice you want. I usually just get traditional boil medium which is the normal "Old Bay" tasting shrimp.  They are always cooked very well and taste great add an ear of corn and some sausage if you are feeling it.  The mussels with the trifecta sauce ( garlic, cajun, lemon pepper ) are really tasty and well cooked everytime I get them. If you are feeling super hungry they have excellent hush puppies and onion rings.  Food to Try:  - Shrimp "Traditional" Medium - Mussels "Trifecta" Medium - Onion Rings

I have no idea how you can not love this place. It is fantastic! They make all the tacos to order so they are hot and delicious. They come "plain", but that is so you can build your perfect taco from the toppings bar. The toppings are always fresh and crispy and the salsa is actually spicy! The staff seem to work at both locations and they are very pleasant and helpful.  This location even has carne asada tacos which are pretty good, but I like the fish ones way too much.  So to sum up ignore the low reviews and go try it for yourself. Just make sure to add lots of toppings.
