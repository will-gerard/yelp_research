Best Greek food in Glendale! I came here as a first timer and couldn't be more satisfied! The lady at the counter who owns the place with her husband was so friendly and talked to me the whole time I was waiting for my food. We were discussing the difference between their mom and pop shop compared to other Greek restaraunts. She explained to me that they make all their food themselves, nothing frozen or processed. She gave me a whole container of their hummus for free just to show me how much better it was than other places. They make it fresh every 2 hours or so and it is soooo yummy! Their Chicken Gyro Salad is to DIE FOR!!!!! Definitely my new place for Gyros!

I was really excited to try this new place since it's walking distance from home and there isn't a whole lot to choose from in the Tramonto community! I was sooo disappointed especially for the prices! My rice was chewy on the outside and crunchy in the middle. When I called and complained they didn't offer to refund my meal or even give me some sort of freebie or discount! For a new business I found this strange.They seem like the type of place that will close within the 1st year and re-open with a new name.
