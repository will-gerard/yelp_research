Dirty car?  Have 5 minutes?  Don't make the mistake of buying a roll of quarters hoping to save time and 5 bucks at a self-serve joint.  You'll spend 7 and your shoes will get wet.  Full Circle charges 5 (specials for 3) dollars for an exterior wash and it's the best ever.   Why would anyone ever wash their own car?  Before you enter the circuit a human gives your car a pre-scrub with a soapy brush, after the auto wash/rinse and high-pressure blow dry cycle another human is waiting to do the manual dry.   While they are working on your car dig for quarters in the abyss (area between the console and your seat) then you can stop by the self-serve car wash for a vacuum if you need it.  I don't know about you but the rest of interior work you get with a full interior/exterior car wash for 15 bucks usually sucks.  You can do better yourself in less than 5 minutes with the KFC wet nap you just found under the passenger seat.

Do you like deep tissue massage?  Audie is AMAZING!  I disovered this on a fluke, responded to a special Groupon deal.  I have never been comfortable getting a massage until this day.  Audie was professional, caring and the consummate therapist.  You can feel the love.  It's so obvious that she truly enjoys what she does.   Give her your email address she will send you great deals, remind you of your appointments - thank you after your sessions with a re-cap of your services and charges - very cool.  Her business is growing and will be moving to new location soon (close by still in Chandler)  One visit and you will be hooked!!

I have My friend Tigearnan to thank for first introducing me to Pesto's.  Who knew it even existed with it's unassuming stripmall facade.   I was pleasantly surprised to meet Antonio, a superb bartender who makes you feel as if he invited you to his house for dinner and cocktails with 40 or so of his closest friends.  He mixes a mean martini and helps you make the best drink and eat choices to fit your mood.  The lighting is right, the food fresh and tasty and the staff bring it all together for a delightful evening of socializing and or just eating.  I'm crazy for their house Pesto Pizza and  fabulous Greek Salad.  All this for a great price.  It's a jewel in the East Valley you have to check it out.

You gotta try the glazed chicken pizza with caramelized onions and feta cheese on lavosh bread - it's so tasty as is the grilled chicken houmus.   The live music is an added bonus.  You can get the wrong impression of this place if you hit a bad night but I would say in general this place is a definite winner!  If you're hungry, and don't want to spend a lot of money, this fills the bill.

This place is the spot for Happy Hour 4-6 pm.  They have several drink specials, I didn't listen after I saw the juicers at the bar and heard "orange slice martini" (3.75).  This drink is perfect, the orange slice floater tops it off- yum.  Next I tried a greyhound - of course fresh squeezed grapefruit and I added  the extra shot of Grey Goose for 1.25.   All appetizers are half off, you have to do the prime rib (no joke) sliders for about a fin.  WOW, this going to be a once a week gig methinks!  Not overcrowded, great lighting, comfortable and great service.  Give it a shot.  Oh, and the complimentary party of 6 or more Nachos were a hit.

A few years back I was overtaken by lower back pain that wasn't going away and continued to get worse.  I opened up the phone book and found Pam.  I think my misery came through on the phone, I got in that same day.  When I arrived I could barely get on the table but was immediately soothed by the hot compresses Mary Beth placed on my back which helped to relax me.  Pam listened to me, assessed my issues, felt my spine then told me all about it, things other chiros in years past needed x-rays to read.  She prescribed an estimated 5-6 visits to fix me (my insurance covered about 20).  She gave me my first treatment and I walked out of her office 75% better.  After 5 treatments in 3 weeks time I was 100%.   Years later I suffered from Frozen Shoulder syndrome.  I don't recommend it.  Pam sent me over to her husband Dr. Ed.  He attacked my shoulder with a vengeance and managed to help me gain 50% more motion after 2 treatments.  I then figured out - if you have a chronic condition, see Ed.  If you have back issues and need adjustment, go see Pam.  They are the whole package.  They treat and instruct and give great practical advice as to how to help yourself get better.  I highly recommend them both!

The flight to was delayed at first for 40 minutes, then an hour and a half due to maintenance... whatever.  The return flight - was canceled, please wait in that line to find another flight.  This other line had one harried ticketing agent that obviously didn't have the right answers for the passengers because the line wasn't moving.  Meanwhile there were 4 baggage agents waiting to check in all the people who's flights were canceled - oh, next flight home was more than 6 hours later.  Oh, the cancellation was due to local weather - interesting that no other airline was canceling flights.   US Airways mission statement  "To provide best class poor service without care because in todays' economy everyone need to save a buck".  NEVER AGAIN!

Eureka!  I think this is it..  Finally GREAT raw fish in the Phx area. Sushi Kee is a small neighborhood sushi bar with quality fish, portions to wow and prices that make you think twice about stopping by the market on your way home from work.   Use Omega 3  fatty acids as your justification.  The first time you go you will over order if you do your usual checklist.  The slabs of fish are about 6 inches long, more than an inch wide teetering on a bit of rice,  deliciously fresh.   I folded mine like a pizza sandwich and attempted the all in one bite, not a chance.   My favorite this night was the salmon - great fat content with that butter consistency.   If salmon isn't fresh, no amount of wasabe and soy can mask it,  this was perfection.  I can't wait to go back.

I'm more into coffee but somehow I was roped into going for afternoon tea to commemorate mother's day.   If I had been the one planning, it would have been a bloody mary brunch since I'm not one to enjoy acting subdued as the picture is in my head of  ladies drinking tea.  My first sip of well-filtered ice water told me the tea was going to taste great.  The service was impeccable.  The savories and sweets were tasty, I especially loved the curry egg salad and cucumber finger sandwiches,cranberry scones with lemon curd (YUM) but best of all was the champagne split (Laurent-Perrier)which is included with the Grand Royal tea for $40.00.  We were served from a split but it seemed we were splitting it with anyone that wanted a refill-they kept it coming.   We sat by the piano so the music was just loud enough that we could manage a bawdy conversation.  The champagne reminded us that we had much to talk about.  Bonus- it wasn't crowded which is surprising for such a big day, we were able to relax  and take our time, none of that sense of need to turn the table.  Bravo!

If you need a new computer, or service on yours I highly recommend visiting Red Seven.  These guys know what they are doing and they are out to give you the best product at a great price.  Tell them what you want to do with your computer and they will custom build a new machine that will do everything you need it to.  If you don't have a lot of $$ they will sell you a used machine that is light years ahead of what you might pick up at a retailer for 5 times the price.   Small business owners, give them a call and ask them about their perpetual PC deal.  If you need to pick a brain, this is the place to go.  Save yourself from the big Corporations - you will be buying a first rate backed product with mom and pop personal service.

Tired of the standard breakfast fare?  Stop by Pleaissant Croissants and pick up a dozen or so to bring to the office or treat yourself to just one.  They have a large variety of flavors.  If you bring an assortment to the office each is coded with a frosting doodle indicating what's inside.  These will make you a star, if you're late be a little bit later,  no one will notice.

First impression: Great ambiance, good-looking clientele  and awesome staff.    Cocktails - yummy pomegranate margarita and martini's, perfect with a ruby grapefruit garnish.  We started with the mixed mescaline, fresh strawberry and dried blueberry salad.  Perfect balance of flavors, right amount of acid and textures (cashews, nummy).  We were off to a great start.  Entree's, we had the lamb kisra which is like an open face schwarma with a tasty herbed crust topped spinach, feta cheese, and a lemon basil dressing poured over the top (just the right amount) delicious!  Also we had the special- lobster pasta (very nice) and the balsamic blue cheese burger (heaven) with sweet potato fries- yes!.  There was much oohing and aweing going on at our table.   I am very excited to find such a great new spot.  Thomas was working his butt off but took the time to visit with us and made sure we had a delicious slice of chocolate fudgy cake to top off a fabulous meal.  Prices very reasonable too boot.  Thank you for a great night!

Jamaican, Mexican Chinese food are you kidding me?  Somehow it all works.    It's quirky and fun although a bit confusing at first but they are patient, friendly and helpful.   If you can't decide what you want they will let you taste before you get in line to order.   I tasted the jerk chicken which was excellent.  I was in a mexican mood so I went with carnitas and machaca which was good and fresh but  a bit plain for me.  I got the impression from everyone else at the table that chinese was the way to go.  The snickerdoodles cookie served with every order is a nice touch.   Prices are really reasonable -great for lunch!  Chinsalutemon'

For breakfast or brunch, do yourself a favor,  skip the coffee and go for a Garden bloody Mary - it's their bloody mary mix spiked with celery and carrot juice and of course pepper vodka.  It's garnished with a perfect crispy pickle.  To die for.  Nothing like a couple of these to soothe your head the morning after.  To eat I recommend the Maine Lobster, asparagus and mozzarella omelet.   For 16.50 I didn't anticipate finding any meat but there was plenty, and  no shell to deal with which to me is a huge bonus.    If you're in the mood for pub food you must try the chicken tenders... if that sort of food can ever be 5 stars they would taste like these.

I couldn't believe I was in Phoenix.  The BF and I took a ride to the Tempe block party (deserves another yelp) on New Years.  The trains clean and shiny, the stations tastefully appointed.  It was lots of fun.  Of course on NYE it was taking passengers til 2 am for the occasion but that is not the norm.  I'm going to follow suit and say, when the hours are expanded to 2 for weekends it will rate the 5 stars.  Hooray for progress Phoenix!

This company does its best to mislead customers about it's memberships.  There is no such thing as "no membership fees" or "month to month" memberships with no contract.  Do yourself a favor and don't join.  If you do join make sure you read every page of your contract -  even the fine print before you sign.  Don't be distracted by the sales person they are probably beat over the head with quota so the customer means nothing to them.  They just hope you won't read what you're signing.  It's hard to believe businesses get away with such shameful practices.

When you've had enough of Starbucks support your local Free Trade Coffee shop.  It's the only mom and pop coffee nook I've ever been to that has strong delicious fresh coffee every day.    The owners did plenty of research to get it that way and the taste proves it was worth the effort!!

Honest, fast, and reliable.  Great guys and great machines.  Bought my first from them over two years ago- got a great deal.  It has been turned on and used every day since and has never so much as hiccupped once.    Thank you!!

New, clean and tasteful decor, plasma screens on every wall.  Friendly staff, I was impressed, now for the food.    For an appetizer  we had the fried tofu which was served with a peanut dipping sauce, nice.  I think I had bun thit cha gio or something like that (no. 22) rice angel-hair noodles with beef,  shrimp and a chicken spring roll which I broke up and tossed all together with the  light rice-wine dressing.  It was superb - fresh quality ingredients and perfectly prepared.  My dining mate had a beef curry stew served with french bread to dip in the gravy, yumm, great choice!   No liquor license yet, a Vietnamese beer would have sent me over the edge.  As it was the iced jasmine tea did very well. As soon as I finished my meal I was making plans to return.  The bill - $28.   I'm asking myself why cook?

Great atmosphere, comfortable vibe, fun friendly crowd and staff to match.  Old Town Tavern is the spot for any night of the week you want to relax with a beverage.  You will be completely comfortable by yourself- you'll make friends- or you can bring your own.

Bryan is incredible.  He is smart and you will quickly see that he has been around the block more than a few times.   I called to have him solve a breaker issue.  Another electrician would have milked me for a couple days.  Brian took the little bits of information we gave him and solved the problem immediately.  To him it's no sweat. I will have him back for some wish list items if he ever has time.  The more word gets out I may not be so lucky.   If  you need an electrician you better call Bryan.    Oh, and I noticed his watch moves a lot slower than mine.  He's more than reasonable when it comes down to writing up the invoice.  Don't be thrown off and forget to tip.  Thank you Bryan!!

They have a store upfront where you can pick up your own "Sause" and/or Rub, and a breakfast taco if you're in a rush.   The meat is very high-quality and the Sauce to die for.  First had Rudy's in the late 80's brought in from TX, I was hooked.  What a treat having it local.  I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.  Don't let the long lines fool you - it moves fast!

Couldn't wait for it to open, drove past every day surprised to see just a  piece of wood spray-painted "Open soon".  Finally called and found out it was open.  I find it odd that they didn't take the time to paint an "Open at Last" sign.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the other location, so I expected basically the same thing.  The restaurant is very nice - but scaling up the dig includes raising $ as expected.  My margarita was very tasty  - better than the other spot but the food went downhill.  I'm so disappointed!!  Chips and salsa were good, entrees- just okay, beans and rice, really bad.   I hope they figure it out - love having them in the neighborhood.
