Great food, good service - I had Sesame Chicken lunch special - Reminds me of Chinese food back in Chi-Town.  Excellent value for the $, but maybe the person answering the phone could have a bit less attitude, ;-)

Chinese delivery in south Phoenix, you betcha! Good food, ample portions, quick efficent delivery - my kind of place. I ordered the seasame chicken and potstickers, both were excellent and delivered while still piping hot.

I grew up on Chicago's Northwest side, I know a real Gyro. Niro's has Gyros like nobody's business. I've also had their Italian beef, also excellent. I just ate at the new Tempe location, and I am soooo glad I did. The Ahwautukee location is great but a bit further to go for me now.  Facilities are neat and clean at both locations as far as I've seen, and there is a 'midwest' kinda feel that the transplanted vagabond in me yearns for.

I recently had to try to get a replacement battery for "she who wants to be free's" cell phone. I admit to being a bit pessimistic that they would have a battery for the LG Vu. Arriving near opening, I was glad to see the shop open and actually staffed by someone who had an interest in customer service. I hope I don't butcher the managers name, I believe I remember it as Perri, but given my advanced state of forgetfulness, it could be Penny or Janice. The manager took the time to find a battery (online not in store) and have it shipped directly to the apartment, saving me a possible multi-hour/day trip to superstition springs mall center. She was also very knowledgeable, providing honest opinions on a number of my other questions.  In short, a very nice experience during a very stressful week.

Sound issues, some obvious regulars less than welcomming, some there having fun but I was underwhelmed.

I have recently made a very nice transaction with Red Seven Computers. My soon to be former spouse referred me to Red Seven's facebook posting regarding a used PC that was available. After a quick phone call, possibly two and a small flurry of activity, she/we acquired a very good bargain on a slightly used PC. The new PC was here, set-up and playing nice on Susan's apartment network within minutes of arrival. In the dealings with Red Seven computers since then, they have been unfailingly professional - even for a bunch of linux fanboi's {just joking, Michael Cady and crew are the epitome of excellent customer service and practical technical knowledge. I was very close to 5 stars on this review but am hoping that Red Seven has some awesome surprises to push it into the 5 star status sphere.

Order for pickup, then made to wait because 'someone didn't put in the chocken? WTF? Why bother having an app if your people don't use the system. Plus pizza was mediocre in texture and greasy. Domino's you turned a treat for my grandson into a hot tired extended walk that left most of the people full, but not pleased with what they ate.

Sadly when I was in, there were no drink specials, so I had to console myself with a large KiltLifter. Excellent staff, {very easy on the eyes, Yay Stephanie! and casey} Pool tables and enough large screen TV's to choke a horse, this is a 'typical' sports bar with a friendly ambiance. I didn't have any food but the 'Sliders' were delicious. (Her words, not mine, lol) They have most every sports event either on or available, come for Football if ya have a chance.

I dine here when my budget/diet allows. I think the food has improved in quality lately. I am in serious like of their Burrito, Carne Asada, with avocado and everything. Not too spicy for me (most Arizona residents would probably say not spicy at all)

Ordered delivery, small confusion over my address but easily resolved. Fast delivery, accurate and good portions - plus they gave me a couple extra eggrolls! I ordered lunch specials and appreciated the fried rice with the entrees. Excellent value - and very tasty.

Booked a discount cab online, received a confirmation number, 5 minutes after it was booked I called to get an ETA. There order was confirmed but per the agent/dispatcher there was no cab on the way. I asked that they hurry a cab to my location because I needed to get to work, I was given a time frame of 5 to 20 minutes. (this is the predigested pap they spread whenever you ask an eta... but I believed her) Twenty five minutes later, No cab. Called again, got apologies but when pressed for a real time was told 15 to 20 MORE minutes. Taxi finally arrived after the time I was supposed to login, and I finally was able to arrive LATE for work (which I do detest). So, to reprise; 1) Online Booking failed 2) speaking to a live customer service agent/dispatcher did not resolve the situation - it made things worse 3) The CS agent was polite but ineffective in getting any sort of resolution that may have helped the situation and finally 4) It will be a snowy day here in Phoenix before I use this shoddy, ineffective and at times hazardous taxi service .

Being in the area, I decided to give this place a try, Man I am not disappointed! Good food, excellent service, I cannot rave enough over this gem. I had the rib tip tacos, and some chips and guac. - not only was everything delicious, but served with a smile and very quickly. Good portion size, excellent taste and outstanding customer service make The Stand a Stand Out whenever I am in this part of town.
