This sushi joint looks and smells great but I left highly unimpressed. The waitress was flat with no personality, no time management, and said little to nothing. Most of her time was spent in the service well talking to some stereotypical "bros". The shrimp tempura roll was labeled $5.75 but we were charged $8.50. I wanted to bring this to the attention of our waitress but I couldn't chew and swallow fast enough to say something before she'd drop and run. The tempura roll was bland and made sloppily. However, the sushi rice was made perfectly, it was sticky and just a little sweet. Both the fried rice and yakisoba noodles were drenched in sesame oil and were only enjoyable after a liberal application of Sriracha. For $64, bad service, and just okay food I won't return and do not recommend this place.

Two words: crab cakes. From the bangin' warm salsa to the delicious quatro leches cake this agave bar is my cup of tea. With half price appetizers and $2 off of tequila this is the perfect place for Happy hour.

Great beer choice ( though not draft) and the food is EXCELLENT. The fig and cheese dessert Empanada was a perfect, sweet and savory finish. Mondays and Tuesdays you can get 4 empanadas and four beers ( or a bottle of wine) for $20 (2 People min.) I highly recommend this chic, little hole in the wall joint.
