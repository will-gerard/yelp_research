I know this is treasonous but I wasn't all that impressed.  I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  The food was very average in my opinion although the service was very friendly and quick.

As far as larger, international airports go, Pier-Elliott-Trudeau is very nice.  Customs was clean and efficient.  The terminal was very clean and seemed to be recently updated.  I was in the Delta side of the terminal so I'm not sure if the rest of the terminals are as well maintained but I was please.  There were decent food options and most importantly(and rare), they have free wi-fi.  I had trouble connecting at first but it eventually worked after a few tries.

Great hotel!  Excellent service during my 5 day stay.  For the price, the rooms were very nice, clean and well appointed.  Free wi-fi(although very slow).  They do have a decent breakfast but it's not free.  It's in a sketchy area but if you need to be near the airport this is the place I would recommend.  Just don't go for a midnight stroll through the neighborhood.

Location, location, location....  I travel a lot for work and for the hotel points I usually stay at Hilton properties.  This also means that I've stayed at probably 20 different Hilton Garden Inns across North America. I recently spent 3 nights here and was really impressed.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The property was always clean.  It's location on Rue Sherbrooke makes it a great location to be based out of for exploring the city.  It took me a day to give the Bixi bike system a chance and luckily there is a Bixi location conveniently located across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn.  If the weather permits, I highly recommend exploring the city using the Bixi rental bike system.  Montreal is very bike friendly and it makes getting around town a breeze(and it's really cheap).

I was in Montreal recently for a long weekend and fell in love with this place.  I liked it so much I went for dinner two nights in a row.  They have lots of unique drinks to choose from. The lovely ladies behind the bar were very attentive and helpful.  They really made the experience special.  The food was always excellent and the drinks were delicious.  The atmosphere was really lively and fun.  They also have a roof top patio when the weather permits.

Love this place!  Great, homemade brats!  Everything they serve(except for the bread) is made in house which is cool.  They have a great beer selection.  Nice open, patio area out back!

Only stayed here one night but I was very impressed!  It was a Saturday night in November and I was able to score a rate of $114 for a king size room.  Not bad!  I didn't think it had much "curbside appeal" but once you get inside it's got lot's of charm and appeal.   I really didn't explore the property much because I was there for a limited time but the room was really cool and creative.  If I was back in the area I would definitely stay here again and check out more of the property.
