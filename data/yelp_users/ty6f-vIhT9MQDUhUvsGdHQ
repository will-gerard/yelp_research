The Nosh is ok.  Bagels are mediocre, nothing special.  The older lady who works behind the counter should stay at home.  She's short worded, unwelcoming, and flat out rude to customers.  If you want a real bagel with friendly service there is a much better place up the street on Elliot.  However, if you want an Einstein's copy with Darth Vader behind the counter, come to The Nosh.

DO NOT EAT HERE  This is by far the worst excuse for a sandwich shop, or any restaurant for that matter, that I have ever been to.  I have been here 3 times now and 2 of the 3 have been absolutely awful.  First time was ok, nothing spectacular but at least the food was decent.  The second time was much worse and the third time was the last straw for me.  I ordered a turkey sandwich.  The guy working the register didn't give me change so instead of canceling the transaction and reopening the register he decided to give me money out of his own wallet and told me "he'd make it up in tips".  OK.  Also told me to get a free drink for the inconvenience, which I declined.  Literally 4 more people came in, ordered, and all got their sandwiches (1 of which was wrong so he also was offered a free drink for inconvenience) before I got mine.  Two of the orders before me were hot so they had to cook on the flattop.  I spoke up and asked what the deal was.  Everyone looked at each other like I was the crazy one when finally a guy, who I'm assuming was the manager, appeared from the back and gave me a refund upon my request.  Two out of three times these morons messed up my order and I will never eat here again.  I tell all my friends and coworkers not to eat here and now I am telling you DO NOT EAT HERE.    I would give this rat hole zero stars if possible.  Look around and you will see filthy floors, grease stains behind the cook station, public restrooms where they prepare the turkey.  The restrooms are literally in the kitchen.  You have to walk thru the prep station to use them.  Are you kidding me?  How is this sanitary?  This place and all of the people who work here disgust me.  Finally, if the owner or store manager somehow comes across this post I would highly recommend a turnover in employees because the ones who work this store are incompetent and are also costing you money by handing out free drinks and not zeroing out register transactions.    DO NOT GO HERE

I cannot say enough good things about Kathy's Alterations.  The work is second to none, and Kathy goes above and beyond to deliver.  Let me give you my most recent experience...  I referee High School football weeknights and weekends.  I took my only pair of football pants into Kathy for some alterations and was scheduled to pick them up Friday morning before my game that evening.  Well, as it turned out, Thursday morning I was assigned a last minute JV game for that evening and of course I needed my pants.  Kathy was not in the office, nor were my pants, but I was assured a message would be passed along and Kathy would contact me.  No longer than 30 mins passed when I got a phone call from Kathy who assured me I would have my pants no later than 4pm.  Kathy drove half way across Phoenix to pick up my pants and bring them back to Ahwatukee for me to pick up an entire day before I was scheduled to.  Not once did she seem irritated or annoyed with me.  She made me feel like family.  Reasons like this are exactly why I will continue taking all of my alteration needs to Kathy, and why you should too!

Easily the best bagels in Phoenix.  Lofty statement I know, but try for yourself and you'll say the same thing.  Well done Bagel Man

Hands down one of the best sandwich shops in town. Clean, friendly, and the sandwiches are always packed high with fresh ingredients. Try the All American for $5

I know nothing about A/C's.  Searched Yelp for a good company to give my business to and I couldn't be happier with Arizona's Dukes of Air.  Robert came to my house within an hour of calling and had the problem fixed in about 45 mins.  Not only did he get my unit up and running but he went out of his way to show me some preventative maintenance tips.  I would highly recommend giving these guys a shot.

One of the best happy hours around. All alcohol and apps are half off, and with over 40 beers it's a great selection. A 20oz craft IPA is $3.75!!! Happy hour 3-6 during the week and 10-close. Pretty sure weekends are only 10-close. Definitely worth a stop if you're passing by and thirsty for great beers.
