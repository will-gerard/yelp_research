I'm all done with Venezias! Used to order quite regularly & the quality has just dropped. I called a order in last week, went in to pick it up to find out they burnt it and had to remake it. I'll stick to Sals, Barros or NYPD. Thanks but no thanks.

Went here a few weeks ago for a " girls night " dinner before heading out and it was AMAZING. I am Italian, and pretty much a Italian food snob and this place felt like I was eating Sunday Dinner at my grandma's house.  We signed up for their e-mails online and scored buy 1 get 1 free vouchers. We ( group of 5 ) ordered a few entrees and shared: Antipasto salad, chicken martini, spinach and ricotta dumplings ( AMAZING  - and I am not a big ricotta cheese fan, but these were superb ) the bread was great - the service was friendly and very good. Not sure whats up with some of these negative reviews - but it's a excellent italian spot and I will continue to return.

We left our boxer for a long weekend at Pete and Mac's for the first time. He had a great time and was zonked out when we brought him home. He left behind a ball that he enjoys to play with and they promptly called to let us know. Extremely courteous, professional and polite. I'll definitely use them in the future! Thanks for taking care of my furry pet!

Do they have a menu? Because I've been in twice now for the exact same service and charged two different amounts. This last time they actually cut my toe - probably because they were busy gossiping and their boss the entire time. Needless to say, I won't be back

Love this place! Great cigar selection and great atmosphere, not to mention great whiskey and wine selection. Outside is nice to relax and they usually have sports on. Also have misters for when the weather gets warmer.

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE COMPANY! They did NOT clean my house well at all. They were very unapologetic when I voiced my concerns. They did not even address the issues about the things their staff broke in my house. They simply offered me 10% off my next cleaning. Are you kidding me? I will never allow those people in my house again. I will take my business to a competitor. There are plenty of cleaning companies in Arizona and they should take notice. They need to work on their people skills. I understand they are a small company, but word of mouth is everything and I have told EVERYONE about this as well as filed a complaint with the BBB.

I have been to a few different European wax centers and this is my favorite. I've seen Alyssa and Erica for brazillians and they are both fantastic!

Got a last minute reservation for my birthday last weekend. They are small, so I would suggest a reservation. You can sit at the bar, tables, or they have couches that are super comfy and fun to share a bit and drinks with friends. We had the bartender wait on us as we sat in the chairs. Everything was amazing, from the craft cocktails, to the bruschetta, salad, burgers and wine list. I almost went to Postino's - glad I didn't. This place blows them out of the water! Can't wait to come back!

Best Derm office in Arizona! I've been seeing Brenda for skin screens, mole/skin tag removal and will continue going. This office makes you feel comfortable and they listen to your concerns. Highly recommend!

I wish I liked this place. So many good reviews but my burger was undercooked and I felt the brews were lacking. Good atmosphere and I may come back to get it another try.

This place was delish! Our first time and we will definitely be coming back. Thankful for a friends recommendation because they are so hidden in the back of a strip mall. Amazing sliders, ( we had the pulled pork ), Wings ( medium ) but saucy and grilled - so good! The sweet potato fries were really crispy as well. We sat at the bar and had great service. Will definitely be back!

Saw Tracy for a cut and she was great! I was out in half a hour and my cut was exactly what I asked for. She was efficient & didn't try to upsell me any products that I didn't need. Thanks Tracy !

Having been here a few times and it's always a good time. This past Friday I was there and all the bartenders took care of us and made sure that our drinks stayed full. Can't wait to go again!
