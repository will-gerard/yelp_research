Scammers!  They advertise these low rates and when you actually get there to get your car, UP Goes the PRICE!  I did need to upgrade my car but I didn't expect a $200 difference!  So I did what I had to do, got a Hyundai Sonata for $307.00. Once I got down to pick up the car I realized and totally overpaid so I went back upstair to see about getting my money back.  Once I got up there, the price went down ton $187 for the same CAR!  So Now I thought, ok I'll pay the extra $50 for my pride and just eat it.  Got the car, had a Great Trip to Cali, went to return the car and they were going to charge me $51 to fill up!  When I had rented it initially they had told me I could prepay for gas at $2.87 which is way cheaper than the real world so I had ok'd it.  When my price magically lowered the second time, it was because they had removed that pre-pay gas. Ugh!  I hate the men at that desk and I will never EVER go back.

This was my first time here. Service was great. We had the truffle fries, beet salad, house salad and the seafood pasta. All the food was excellent. Portions are not huge, but just the right amount. With the free cinnamon rolls we enjoyed every bit!!!

Sooooo glad they brought a Pita Pit to Ahwatukee. This place is so healthy and fresh. We went in tonight, I ordered the Gyro and my husband ordered the chicken crave. Anthony cooked up the meat and made out Pitas!  They were Delicious and the ingredients were so fresh. We will be back!
