I have to be completely honest...I never really write reviews but this time I had to. I arrived 15 minutes early for my 12:00pm body wrap, a spa service I purchased through Groupon, per the gal who scheduled my appointment. There were 3 employees standing at the front desk when I walked in...chatting or should I say gossiping because they were whispering to each other. They were soon joined by another gal and I was left sitting in the waiting area until 12:13 having to listen to all 4 of them talk and order lunch. When Kelly came to get me my appointment was already 13 minuted behind. In my opinion, Kelly was the ONLY saving grace for this place (and the reason I marked them with 2 stars instead of 1). She was super nice and did an excellent job taking care of me. I would consider going back just to get a regular massage from her but the rest of the staff ruined my desire to return at all. On top of the fact that my appointment started 13 minutes late it also ended 2 minutes early bringing my 60 minute body wrap down to 45 minutes. All in all it was a very disappointing experience. I was really hoping to find a spa that I could frequent on a monthly basis. Onto the next one I guess...

Sarah Kesler is the absolute best you can get! Not only is she extremely talented in everything she does but she actually listens to what you want and does it. I have been getting my hair cut with her for so long and trust her so much that I have no issue with sitting in the chair and letting her do whatever she wants. I have never ever left her chair unhappy or even slightly unsatisfied. I would recommend her to anyone! Oh and she gives a fantastic scalp massage too!

Well...Sarah did it again! I am almost 8 months pregnant and have been feeling less than attractive. I went into my appointment the other day feeling kinda hopeless and Sarah totally turned around my attitude. I, once again, just sat down in her chair and gave her complete reins to do whatever she wanted. The end result was not only flattering for my face shape but I felt stunning. I felt stunning and didn't have a lick of makeup on my face. These days it's hard to feel beautiful in my "natural" state but she made me feel it. Thanks again Sarah!

I was beyond impressed with this place! I had the unfortunate experience of getting side swiped leaving my poor car with a scrape down its side. Gerber is teamed with Geico, the insurer for the guy who hit me, and I was told to come in, drop off my car, and they would have a rental waiting for me. Everything went exactly as they said. I dropped my car off and was on the road again within 10 minutes. The repairs went relatively quickly for what they had to do and when I picked it up I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The main thing that I loved about them was their follow through. If they said they were going to call on Tuesday afternoon they called on Tuesday afternoon. I would use and recommend them to anyone!

I love this place! I worked with the midwives for my delivery and couldn't have asked for a better experience. I delivered at Mercy Gilbert and Janice was the midwife on call. She was absolutely amazing! My body wasn't too excited about the idea of giving birth and Janice worked with me to make it a wonderful experience. That's saying a lot because I was in the delivery room for 24 hours, pushed for almost 3 and gave birth to a 9 pound 6 ounce 22 inch long baby boy. I would recommend the midwives to anyone having a baby.

What an amazing experience! I've taken my son, not quite 2, to a few different places including specialty kids shops where the haircuts cost me almost $20. When he needed his hair cut again I decided to take him to a men's barbershop and this place is right by my work. Best. Decision. Ever. The fellow who cut his hair treated him like a man not a little boy. There were no special toys or fancy distracting. He used the clippers and just a comb to get my son to look where he needed him to look. It was amazing! The best haircut my son has ever had. I highly recommend this place! I'm just bummed I discovered it right before we are getting ready to move.

Love! Love! Love! Megan is the one that did my brows and I can't even believe the difference. I can't wait until my brows grow back in from over-plucking. DO IT!

I was super turned off by the dishonesty of our waitress. My bill was $18.53 (or .50 something) and I put $40 cash in to get change for a tip. When our waitress brought my change back over 5 minutes later (and me having to ask for it) she only bought back $20. 3 5's and 5 1's. Thinking I couldn't count I gave it to my friend to count who also counted $20. Now $1.50 isn't that much but it was MY $1.50 to decide about. We took the change up to the front and asked where the rest of our change was. The person disappeared with out bill and our waitress came back to...no...not apologize but to claim that there was $21 in there. That she had "kept $19 for the bill". I hadn't realized that by paying in cash that meant that the waitress got to automatically keep any change that should have been in there. Granted I would have left the change in there anyway but it was MY money to decide on. She went so far as to ask me if I wanted to count the money again. Of course there would be correct change in there now. She had just gotten the chance to add more. We had already counted it several times before complaining. It was only $20. I still left her $3 which, when combined with the change she already kept, brought her to a $3.50 tip. A fair tip for an $18.50 bill but had she been honest she would have gotten a $5. I was so disgusted by her lying and then trying to cover it up that I will NEVER eat there again. EVER.
