1. Who's idea was it to space out the terminals to point that there are only about 8 gates at each corner? which leads to... 2. The food available at each corner is so limited and mundane that unless you have 2 hours to walk around, you're stuck eating at 1 of 3 options available. which leads to... 3. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM!!! and... 4. where are the seats? where are the outlets? where's the mofucking water fountain???  You'll be saying "Where" a lot here.

If the Trump Tower was located anywhere but Vegas, It'd be perfect. But it just seems so out of place (literally) for a Vegas hotel.  I came here with a large sponsored group over the weekend, so everything was complimentary, so I can't say anything about money value of this hotel.  The lobby/public area was very clean and spacious. Gold as far as the eye can see. I loved the mini suites with the kitchenette and REAL fridge. Not one of those mini 'bars' with $10 bottles of water and $15 bags of M&M's. Too bad realistically, you won't be cooking anything at all here. The bathroom was amazing with the built in tv on the mirror (perfect for bumping music while getting ready for the night!). Separate HUGE bathtub. Shower head had the weakest pressure and sprayed water unevenly.   Beds were very very comfortable and we had a great view of the strip. Unfortunately there is ZERO reception in the room/hallway. My phone was basically useless unles sI went into the lobby or was out on the strip. Also, the wifi never connected!  The pool area is huge! We missed it, as we came too late. But one of the roaming guards was nice enough to let us go outside anyway and dip out feet under the cold vegas sky and take pictures! How nice! He also gave us a hint on how to get to the rooftop, but the door to the roof was locked when we found it :( Thanks anyway random nice roaming security dude!  My 2 biggest pet peeve about this hotel was the elevator and the fact that it doesn't have a casino. I knew the casino thing before coming, but the problem would arise from the fact that we would be on the strip, and some people would want to go back to the room. We would have to take a taxi or wait for the shuttle since the hotel is off the strip. Because I wanted to save money, I would hitch a ride back with my buddies. But once we were at the hotel, I realize I actually wanted to gamble some more and there was nothing I could do unless I wanted to walk back to the strip in my painful heels or hail another $$$ cab.  The elevators were annoying! They put my group on floors 31, 34, and 35. The elevators split at floor 34. So to get from my room 31 to my friend's room in 35, I would have to get on the first elevator to get to floor 34, get off, walk down the hallway to the next one, and take that one to 35! The first day we were so lost and confused it took forever to even find our friends. The worst was when I had to travel from floor 35, take an elevator, grab our friends on floor 34, take a new elevator to 31, grab our stuff, then 1 more to the lobby.   Confusing? Yes indeed.  But in the end, it is a great hotel with minimal problems. But for vegas purposes, I prefer being on the strip with a resort/casino.

For my 500th review, I needed to write a review that will really be fun and reflect the atmosphere in my life currently.  Seeing that I just came back from Vegas 2 weeks ago and I'm about to head out again in 3 days, I knew that Sin City was just the one!  This upcoming trip will be my 4th visit to Vegas. I didn't think it would be a city that I would fall in love with, but it's really hard not to.  My first trip to Vegas was in 2013. I booked a trip because I was going to the Electric Daisy Carnival, also known as EDC, also known as bunch-of-'ravers'-wearing-tutus-and-getting-fucked-up-to-sellout-DJ's.  I didn't want my first trip to Vegas to only be about EDC, so Kyle H. and I booked a six day ALL VEGAS inclusive trip.  The first three days, we did classic Vegas. We drank all day and all night (and in public of course), we gambled our measly paychecks away, we ate at The Wynn Buffet (best vegan options!), we went to see Cirque Du Soleil (The Beatles Love!), we went to pool parties (Encore Beach Club), we walked the strip to see the Fountains of Bellagio & The Mirage Volcano. The last three days, we partied until the sunrise at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, home of EDC. Needless to say, we did not sleep much, our diet wasn't very...nutritious, and we were braindead by Day 6. Did I mention we also drove? Yeah...10 hour drive back to San Jose was not fun.  That Vegas trip was so crazy, it took me an entire year to recover. I went again the next year with a bunch of girlfriends. It was fun, but was full of drama. *Cue me sitting on a beach chair sipping my Mai Tai watching other girls duke it out* Vegas is apparently where reality show ideas must come from.  I went 2 weeks ago and we did a manageable 3 day trip and it was just so much fun. In 3 days, I am proud and excited to announce that I will be one of the official performers/dancers for EDC 2015! I can't wait to be on stage with world class DJ's, dancing in front of thousands and thousands of people! It is a dream come true and ONLY Vegas can make it happen!  I love you Vegas...for your -hot summer heat (Yes! I love it!) -all day and night drinking (I'm an alcoholic!) -amazing variety of shows to watch (Cirque Du Soleil can't be matched) -pool parties -gambling (don't want it in California, nice to have fun here) -iconic Strip! (get a room with a view-always!) -The empire that is Steve Wynn. (and his incredible vegan dining options!) -constantly reinventing ideas. The Linq High Roller is just an incredible idea with breathtaking views!  I don't love you for your: -traffic. ugh. -disdain for 'car-share' programs like Lyft or Uber. The taxis here suck and are overpriced and need competition. -overpriced drinks. $20 for well drinks...NOT ok! -Prices being different for men vs. women. Even though it *technically* benefits me, I don't agree with it. -pushy, lying club promoters. Ew. -the continued narrowing focus on high end designs and ultra ritzy lifestyle. Old Vegas lifestyle is slowly being pushed out (RIP Riviera). -your slot machines eating my money too fast. But I guess that's my fault for playing slot machines to begin with.  But those are small things that are mostly focused on money. Yes, Vegas is not cheap, but hey who said Vegas was suppose to be a budget vacation? I'm going to have fun, and fun I will have!  To anyone going to EDC, watch for me on the big stage! To everyone else, see you on the strip! Or, you can just stay here on Yelp and read my Vegas reviews for the next few weeks. ;)  Happy 500th Review!

Sucks that this place was how we started our vacation off.  We had an early flight, so by the time we made it to our layover, we were pretty hungry. We didn't have much time so we thought some tacos and burritos would hit the spot. Wrong.  Not only was this place was pricey, you barely get any food. A tiny scoop of rice and beans, and 3 small tacos that looked miserable. I ate 1 taco before the corn tortilla fell apart. I dumped the other 2 and just ate the rice and beans.   It was also super packed and crowded, with barely a place to stand. Don't get your hopes up of finding a chair to sit in.  Luckily we were heading to Texas, where they have the best tacos around, so we could easily forget our experience here.
