Excellent! The food, the service, the ambience. I came on a recommendation from a coworker and I would definitely recommend to others and I will come again. The twice baked potato was delicious, the salads fresh and steak cooked perfectly.

I have been here before and I usually get the chicken and waffles and they are good. Today is the first time I decided to get something different the soulfood platter. 3 pieces of fried chicken 2 sides and corn bread I got mac n cheese and green beans. They were delicious the green beans had lots of flavor and a little heat and the mac n cheese very creamy.

I give Rubio's 5 stars two reasons great customer service even at rush hour lunch time and for the shrimp filled burrito. I thought they were going to be stingy with the shrimp but it was loaded throughout the burrito. When I first bit into it I got three shrimp. I thought "awe man all the shrimp are in one end of the burrito" but it wasn't it was throughout until the last bite!

Went on a busy Saturday night. We expected a long wait. We were told it would be a hour wait and to leave a cell# and they would text us when our table is ready. Never received a text. After waiting a hour and a half we left. Very disappointed

This place is very clean. I have been to alot of nail salons in the past. This one is now my favorite. They use a new clean liner in the spa car everytime. I hadn't been here in over a year and the guy at the front desk recognized me. Very friendly. I got the Relax pedicure which includes spa pedicure plus callus remover, sea salt scrub hot lotion and hot towel. The guy working on me said I didn't have calluses and gave me a cucumber massage instead no additional charge. The best foot massage ever!!!!

They stay open late til 4am. The pizza was great and wings were good. Its hard to find good wings most places put too much breading. These were just right!!! Had great service and the manager came by the table to say Hi. Definitely will go again.
