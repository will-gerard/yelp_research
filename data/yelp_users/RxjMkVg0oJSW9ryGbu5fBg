Our favorite Mexican food place here in Phoenix. It's a New Mexico style place so if you are looking for traditional style this isn't your place. We always get the Pollo con Queso. The spiced cream cheese is amazing.  Hot and fresh chips with salsa.  The mild salsa is a bit too sweet for me but I love their hot. Service is usually excellent.

As has been said before, this is a tiny place full of regular customers.  The portions are generous and the price certainly is right.  The waitress wouldn't stop asking my 2 year old what the "Easter Bunny" was bringing her.  It got kind of old especially since we don't worship Bunnies at our house.  Seating was tight and we got to sit next to a guy having breakfast with his girlfriend and happy to say that his wife was home sleeping.  I wouldn't say that that the clientele all lived in the trailer park but some do.  If we go again we'll try and get there early before the crowds.  The bacon was especially tasty.

These guys really are a bait and switch dealership. Be careful and don't play their shell game. I escaped but it was a frustrating night with their manager Scott telling lies the whole time. We went in to test drive a new 2013 Ram truck. Everyone is advertising incentives and low prices to get rid of all the 2013 trucks ahead of the 2014 models coming in to the dealership. Larry Miller had the truck we test drove on the website listing the price as $41k with a sticker of $50k. That seems like a great deal. After our test drive I told the guy we were meeting with and his boss that I was just shopping and while I had a tendency to be impulsive and wasn't going to be that. The manager said "what if I offer you $3k above KBB for your trade." Ok, let's go in and talk about it. Fill out the paperwork and it's getting late and our young children need to be picked up from the sitter. Scott comes to us and says "I can get your deal done." My wife even asks at the level that we asked? He says yes. She then leaves to go get the kids while I'm going to finish the paperwork. Scott(the liar) comes back with the real deal. First, they won't honor the internet price. Second, they now want to give me $3k below KBB for my trade. Third, they add a BS dealer add on fee of $1,495 for "desert paint" protection and tinted windows. When I comment on that they don't honor the internet price he goes back and lowers the price but also takes off the equivalent amount from the trade in. Does he think I'm stupid? The clear answer is yes. So now we are $12k above the level that we talked about. I was thinking that it would be hard for them to get our deal done and still make money but it would be close. I called my wife back and let her know to turn around. Scott then tries to sell me a truck with a $6k less sticker price. Of course that means we are still far apart. These guys are less than reputable and I'd advise anyone to steer clear. There are a bunch of Larry Miller dealerships and they all appear to be run the same way.  To add insult to injury I get an email the next morning offering me a $38k truck at MSRP plus all their BS add ons. Unbelievable. Here's my advice. Educate yourself on the internet on the vehicle you want. Use KBB to figure out what you should get for your trade, what people are paying for the vehicle your want, and general information about the vehicle. Four hours of research will make you smarter than 85% of the sales persons you will ever run into. Last tip, avoid Larry Miller Dodge like a plague.

What hasn't been said about Matt's???  It's great food and the folks that work there are as friendly as they can be.  Get there early or you'll wait.  Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!  A true Phoenix landmark and place to eat

Awesome little hole in the wall in Tempe.  There isnt much room to sit and it isn't fancy but if you want good food this is the place to go.  A pasty is basically a calzone(only better) with a variety of different types of fillers.  I had the bangers and mash.  The wife had the Italian.  Everything was great served promptly and with a smile.  It's not Scottsdale fancy and that's what I like about it.  Best part is you can get a hearty meal with a soda for under $10.  If you want beer expect to pay a bit more.

I'm very hesitant about writing this review.  Butterfield's used to be our place.  Every Saturday morning we'd load the family up and go there.  Not so much anymore.  They have a wide variety menu items.  If you are into the exotic pancake they've got some for your taste buds including Dutch baked pancakes that are amazing.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is out of this world.  What's the problem?  The service has slid off a cliff over the past year.  I can live with the wacky filipino waiters who are way too friendly but lately there is a collection of young girls that can't seem to get an order correct and can't seem to get anything done in a timely manner.  Last week I sat there for 15 minutes before anyone asked me if I'd like coffee.  This with an active and hungry 2 year old.  The place was half full and there appeared to be plenty of servers on hand.

Quaint little place.  The food is tasty.  If you compare it to Matt's you'll come up lacking but Matt's is easily the best place in town.  This place is a converted old Taco Bell.  They've made it up 50s Retro Chic and it works.  The breakfast portions are good and made with high quality eggs and pork products.  Tater tots for the kids are a big winner.  The coffee is tasty.  I like to hang out there and so does half of the Phoenix Police Department so don't show up if you have a warrant out for your arrest.

We are regulars on Sunday mornings and have been for years. It's a great place for tasty food. Several years ago I gave the place a 4 star review but I think it's ready for an upgrade.   What to eat there?  The chiliquiles are my favorite. Really good flavor and the salsa is out of this world. The Loko Moko is also great if you like the traditional Hawaiian treat. They substitute the traditional hamburger with a brat burger. If you like rice, brats, mushroom gravy, and eggs then go for it. The omelets are great as well. Big and tasty. Normally I get the standard 2 egg breakfast. Make sure to the the Tater Tots. I'm not talking a out the sweet potato ones. They are good but the traditional potato ones are out of this world.

Absolutely the best ice cream around. I stopped into the shop on a lazy Sunday after hearing so many Twitter about this place. I tried both the Salted Butter Caramel & the Almond Toffee Crunch. Both were amazing. I have yet to try the Sorbet but I can attest to the fact that the ice cream is the best in the Valley.

Decided to stop in to Perk Eatery on a Tuesday morning shortly before 8. About Â¼ of the tables were filled. I was by myself. Seated and told that my waiter would be right with me. Look through the menu. Then I look around and there's lot's of Guy Fieri stuff there. They must have been on the DDD show. Ok, so now I've been there probably 7-8 minutes. Guy comes and cleans up the table next to me. I say "Good Morning." He says "Good Morning." Then he leaves. There appears to be some debate going on amongst the staff about who does what. Strange. I just want someone to bring me some coffee. So I wait and I wait and I wait. At 8:15 a group of 3 is seated adjacent to me and someone brings them coffee and takes their order. Seriously, even if you thought(mistakenly) that I was waiting for someone don't you think I might want something to drink. So I left without any fanfare. I was hungry but they won't get my business. Ever.

The PV Mall area is in desperate need of a good breakfast joint. You can get Matt's if you go downtown and there are now multiple Over Easy's around the east valley. Unfortunately, this place isn't it. I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews have this place mixed up with another place. Let me first say I think they are trying but if you are bold enough to have a "Bacon Lovers Entrance" then you better deliver. Everyone was friendly and we seated promptly. My boy had the kids pigs in a blanket and I had the two egg breakfast.   Before I jump ahead I should back up a bit. Coffee... I love good coffee and for $2.29 I expect some tasty premium coffee. No such luck. Burnt and rather acidic this is the kind of swill you get at Denny's. Am I being too picky if I don't like to have the little Shamrock farms containers on the table?  Fresh cream please. You are competing to be the go to breakfast place for the neighborhood.   Back to the food. My 2 eggs, over medium, were serviceable and prepared as expected.  The hash browns were super salty and even the egg yolk couldn't make them tasty. Not good at all. I had the applewood smoked bacon. I got 2 flimsy pieces that probably were cooked 4 or 5 hours ago and were burnt around the edges. They were also appeared to be about 1/2 the size of a normal piece of bacon. This is a bacon place and you serve this?  My Kirkland Signature precooked bacon at home placed in the oven for 10 minutes is way better. Seriously how can you serve this?  English muffin was OK. Everything probably sat for 5-7 minutes before it got to me. Not cold but not just off the griddle either. My son's "Pigs in a Blanket" we're worse. The pancakes were crumbly like a biscuit. They had a strange consistency that really was like a sweet biscuit. The Pigs inside of the blanket were of the Brown N Serve variety or whatever the food supply company sells as a equivalent. Really not good.   How do you call yourself The Oink Cafe and serve these pork abominations?  I know their trying to give you a quality experience but with the pork products they're serving I don't think they are going to be around.

I believe that they have the best subs available anywhere.  Quality fresh ingredients. I love the turkey and Swiss and like to add bacon. The best thing about them is the cookies. The chocolate brownie cookie is the best cookie you'll ever eat. Make sure and get one.

The food was good. This place is tucked in behind the new Cornish Pasty and a little gem. I had the two eggs with potatoes and toast. I added in a side of bacon. Everything was hot and made to perfection. The only complaint that I had was that the coffee was very acidic and reminded me of old diner coffee. My buddy had the french toast and while the bread was a bit bland the fresh compote was excellent. It's a nice little gem and I hope more people find it so they can stay busy.   I didn't eat any baked goods but the key lime pie looked amazing.

Met a friend there for some breakfast. I'm not usually a big fan of bakery type places but this was excellent. You order at the counter. The decor is modern and minimalist. A very nice environment. I had "The Big Breakfast." 2 eggs, mashed potato cake, sausage, mushrooms, and a baguette. Everything was perfect. The eggs were cooked perfectly(over medium), the sausage tasty, the potatoes were well made and finally the mushrooms were perfectly sautÃ©ed. I like things simple and well made. Each item was perfectly prepared and they all complimented each other nicely. Finally their Nicaraguan Organic coffee is smooth and strong. No hints of corporate coffee here. Seriously good breakfast. I can't wait to head back and try something else.

It wasn't busy for 7pm on a Friday night. It should have been a sign. Waited 10 minutes for our server. We ordered the Cubano Torta and the Rotisserie Chicken Tacos. We waited another 25 minutes for the food to arrive. It was obvious that everything had been sitting for at least 10 minutes. The Cubano was very soggy and didn't just have have mustard on it but was a lot of mustard with a little meat. The tacos were also very soggy and I had to eat them with a fork as the corn tortillas were breaking apart. The flavor was pretty good although the cabbage was a bit too sweet for my liking. The lentils and the rice that came as a side were not at all fresh and dry. We did tell the server that the Cubano was inedible and he gladly took it off the bill. I appreciate that willingness to accommodate a customer. It's a great little space and I was hoping for a lot more.

What a disappointment.  The Good Egg and their sister restaurant The Eggery were always great places to go. This location was recently rebranded as a First Watch. I've never been overly impressed with them but the new decor is nice. The service and execution are sub standard. The food wasn't great. My wife's oatmeal was clearly from a packet and my eggs were nothing to write home about. Our three kids each got kids meals. They used to bring a water pitcher out when you were seated. I didn't even pay attention until my daughter asked if she could have some water after our food arrived. We flagged down our server and she got us some water. It felt a little bit strange that we had to ask but ok. Finish up out blah meal and my wife notices on the menu that the kids meals come with a drink. My wife flags down the server and asks about it. Her response "you get a drink if you ask for it."  Really. You don't offer a drink? Response. "Nope."  The server then says well what do they want?  Breakfast is over and I don't think I should have to argue about getting what's included in a meal. Get up to pay and the manager takes the check and my wife questions her. Same response. I handed her my credit card but I told her that I wasn't comfortable paying for drinks we didn't get. She says that she has no clue how to even take that off the bill. Great I'll pay for it but that's the last penny First Watch will ever get out of me. In all fairness my wife followed up with the regional manager and she offered us a free meal but we aren't interested in going back. One interesting note is that the First Watch philosophy is not to ask too many questions. They might want want to amend that so their customers can understand what is included in a meal.
