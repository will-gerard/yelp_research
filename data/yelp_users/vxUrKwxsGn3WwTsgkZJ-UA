I've been going here at least twice a month for the past six/seven years.  JT is a hoot.  They have the best wings in the Valley.  Great jukebox.  The new cafe tables are nice, but hard when you have a big group.  Love this place.

It has been about two years since our last visit, not because we did not like it but because we are normally not in the area.  Thankfully, our friends live nearby and I had been craving tapas and sangria for a while.  It is a tiny place (formerly a cigar shop) with a long communal table and a tiny espresso bar in the back.  Just like our first visit, the moment you walk in you definitely get a cool, neighborly vibe.  It was around 7:30pm and we had about a 20 minute wait, which was not bad since we were able to hang out in the back with our drinks.  We had an order of 1) chickpeas and wilted spinach (the broth that it is cooked in is very flavorful) 2) serrano ham with manchego and mahon cheese (my toes are curling with pleasure) 3) the filet (cooked to a nice juicy pink) 4) shrimp with garlic (the hands down favorite) 5) sautee'd portobello mushrooms (very good) and 6) the daily special of quince paste atop manchego cheese (good, but nothing "special").  In addition to the food, we all had one drink each, plus two pitchers of sangria (the best I have had in the Valley, I think), a coffee and two of their daily desserts (which was pot de creme).  For five people, it ended up being $34/person before tip.

My Husband and I were here a couple of weeks ago.  It was 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty empty, maybe two or three tables were occupied.    We were there with another couple and ordered several margaritas, their combination platter and a side of guajillo mashed potatoes.  We ordered several different tacos, but the ones I was interested were the Camarones a la Diabla and the Fresh Lobster tacos.  The shrimp was WAY too spicy to enjoy.  I like a lot of heat in my food, but not when it overwhelms everything else.  On the other hand, the lobster and jimaca was bland and lackluster.  I would have to say their selection of tequilas are nice.  I had their Cucumber Margarita and it was very cool and refreshing.  We may come back if I get a hankering for margaritas, if nothing else.  Also, I thought we would be in for an inexpensive night, but I guess with the combo platter, four margaritas and a couple of beers, it came out to be just over $80 a couple.

The husband and I dined there on its second night.  We normally wait a couple weeks before we try out a new restaurant, but we live in the neighborhood, so we decided, "Why not?"  We got there around 6:45pm and got a table right away.    I had never heard of burrata so I had to see what is was about.  For appetizers, we ordered the caprese.  Omg.  The burrata was so delicious.  The creamy texture of it was so amazing.  And the tomatoes!  They are McClendon Farms tomatoes and they were heavenly.  Juicy and bursting of flavor.  It was if they just picked it outside.    My husband had their steak salad.  The steak was tender and juicy and he really liked the fresh greens and vinaigrette.  I ordered the shrimp + burrata pie. I liked the dough -- crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside (the way I like it).  The shrimp was fresh and I love the hints of lemon zest and spicy red pepper flakes.    We also had the olive oil gelato.  Delicious and the olive oil taste was very subtle.  The prices are a little high for a pizzeria, but if they keep using fresh produce from McClendon Farms, I will gladly pay for the quality.

I just stopped by here last night to pick up some pastries to go.  I cannot believe this cute little place is sandwiched between a Subway and Fry's grocery store.  I ordered the Strawbery-Rose Gateau, Green Tea Fleur Cake and the Chocolate Bouche.  All were delicious!  The strawberry-rose gateau has a very light strawberry cream (and inside of that cream is a strawberry gel), over shortbread that is encased in a vanilla dome.  The Green Tea had a nice sticky caramel center.  And the bouche was a chocolate and rum ganache.  All the pastries were around $5 each.    I hope this place makes it.

Denise has been cutting my hair for a couple years and she does wonders on my difficult Asian hair. I receive a lot of compliments after every visit - just a testament of Denise's skills and talent as a stylist.
