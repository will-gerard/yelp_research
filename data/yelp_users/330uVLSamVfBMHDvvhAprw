I just don't get it.  this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food.   I know it's southern style....but EVERYTHING is double fried...and you walk out of their feeling like death.  It's expensive ($25 pp with soda) and just not quality food.  this is worth a big SKIP....

I'm a coffee snob & I have to say this place is really good.  I drink americanos and the quality is excellent -- not too burnt but still has good flavor.  In addition, it's hot.....very hot....which is the way is should be.  I like it better than Starbucks.  Worth trying

I know this is a chain so some will always be against it.  But, I love it.  I've been going here for years.  I think the food is great....I just love it.  And I'm also very, very impressed with the service.  I think the place is very well run.  They must have 25 people working....seems like constant service when you need it.  Overall, one of my favorites.

I'll start by saying I don't work at this shop & I don't know the owner.  In fact, I don't know anyone at the shop.  I stopped in because it was close.  Staff -  The staff was pretty nice.  Normal dive shop stuff....friendly.  Overall, they were trustworthy & that's a key value dial for me.  Quality - I had my regulator services & I was impressed.  The price was good ($40), they did it on-time and called me.....and they also included the parts that were replaced, without me even asking.  Price - I was impressed.  I bought some rash guards..and they were the lowest price I could find...including the internet.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they have limited equipment.  It's not bad...but it's not the full line that you would get at say El Mar.  Last point - they have a bus that goes to San Carlos.  With current gas prices...and headaches of driving down there, seems like a good option.  Once I take a trip, I'll update  In summary, if you're in Chandler area, this is a great option.  Overall, I was very happy with them.

I've been going to Florencia for a few years now....and overall I really like it.  I'm from the east coast so I find it difficult to find really good pizza here.  I think the quality is great....and the atmosphere is pretty cool too.  The owner, not sure who it is, staff's it with mostly local high school kids, which I find great.  He or she is helping employ locals.  Overall, I like this one a lot!!!!

Z Tejas has been and always will be one of my favorites here in the valley.  First, the good is great quality and great value.  You can get a great meal for $15.  I know people knock it because it's a "smaller" chain....but don't kid yourself, some of the mom & pop shops in town are just terrible.  Second, Z has great service.  It's one of the best run resturants I've been to and I eat out a lot.  Overall, you can't go wrong with this pick for yourself or for guest.

This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality  Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.  The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.  It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.

Have you ever been to a place & walked out feeling like you were ass raped?  well, if you're into that, you'll love this joint!!!  The food is terrible....but I felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you.  We got a medium sausage, which at any other place is a very small pizza, and it was $22 with tax & tip (no drinks...just water).    Don't be fooled by this "gourmet" shit either.  The crust is tasteless & the quality just isn't there.  when I compare this to say Oreganos, they are not even in the same ball league.  skip this joint....and save your money.

I LOVE coffee and try places all over.  I really, really wanted to like this place.  The coffee is average.  The pastries are average but expensive for what you get (americano is $4, muffin $3).    The wi-fi is ok but don't expect to stream music.  It often cuts out.  The air conditioning is set at a high temp so if you like it cool, this is not the place for you.

I read all the reviews before I went.....and I just don't get it.  I went with three people and we were all dissapointed.....so it wasn't just a single bad meal.  The pasta was over-cooked.......the sauce had no flavor.........and it was expensive.........$30/person w/ just water & no dessert.   It's just not worth the money....

Great quality food and the service is great.  I would go back again.  Only reason I gave a four star vs five is the price -- it's pretty expensive for what it is...but still good nevertheless.

I've stopped in this place for many years.  I always forget how bad it is.  The seats are terribely uncomfortable......they have wireless but you need a code and it's limited to 2 hours.  And the coffee just is not that good.  there are many better options....

I so wanted to like this place because I lover breweries.  I can honestly say this might be THE WORST BAR FOOD I'VE HAD in my LIFE!!  I think dog food right from the bag would be better.  I had the roast beef and we split a pizza.  I've had better roast beef at subway.  The pizza was ok, at best.  I should have noticed because no one was eating.  It's good for beer only.  Save your money on the food.  It's not even in the same ball park as  4-peaks.  too bad.  It would be nice to have more brewpubs in our area.

This place is great....just great.  Been going there for years.  You can get pretty good quality pizza......east like a pig.....for about $15...and that includes salad and drink with tons of pizza.

I'm a HUGE steak fan & I've eaten at many of the top-end chop houses.  This place was GREAT....and well worth the price.  It's a NY style chop house so the interior is more old school vs some of the fancy places in vegas.  The steak is probably the best steak I've ever had....and I"m not too easy to please.

This is a great choice.  The food is excellent & the service is even better.  It's off the strip about 1.5 miles so you need to walk or take taxi.  The pricing is good, given it's a high end steakhouse.  A filet + side + beer came out to $60 before tip.  But, compared to the strip, it's about 1/3 less.  SW, a comparable place in the wynn was running $75 JUST for the filet.  so good choice.  I gave 4 out of 5 only because it's off the strip and not super modern inside.  but, again, that's a small point.

I changed my opinion after going back many times.  this place really is great ice cream.  ----------------------- It's ok....but expensive for what you get.  We went there twice, just to be sure.  a sunday is $10....and you only get 2 scoops.  I've had equal quality at Denny's, beleive it or not, and paid $4.

I ordered the filet and it came under-cooked.  I sent it back and it came back over-cooked.  I sent a quick note to the owner..........and they returned a nice gift certificant (please don't do this unless you really had an issue.  Not fair to company).  Bottom line -  the food was good and I was very impressed with the customer service.

Quality of the food was poor.  Lots of choices but just didn't think the food was worth the price.  Think a stand-alone place is a better choice.  You'll get better quallity food & eat less.

I just don't get this place.  I know some people like it.....and I've given it more than 1 try.....but it's pretty simple -- the food is not that good.  Specifically, the pasta is cooked with a LOT of butter.....and cream sauces, which makes the meal fatty and filling.  In addition, the service is just not good.  We waited.....and waited.  We split a meal and they charged us to do it.  I don't recommend this place....and I won't be going back.

I eat out a lot and I truly love Italian food.  Daniel's is on the high end on costs....and I can say honestly, it's simply not worth it.  We had three meals among us....and not a single one was good.  The place is stuffy and I found the wait staff to be old and not particularly friendly or customer service oriented.  I rank Daniel's at the bottom of Italian and I don't recommend it.  Avoid this one for better options  I read Yelp a lot...so I only provide honest feedback based on my opinion

Appetizer and happy hour deals are extremely good.  The Sushi combos are unimaginative.......but the rolls are good.  The ambiance is typical Phoenix....kinda boring.  But, overall, this place is worth going to.

Make sure you eat dinner BEFORE you arrive...and bring lots of money because you're going to blow it all.  The place itself is great.....atmosphere is great.  Small....good vibe.  But, the portions are TINY....and I mean TINY.  I've had Tapas in other cities and they are great.  These are small & expensive.  We dropped $55 among three of us (not including alcohol) and I had to eat after.   It just wasn't worth the price....

Not a fan.  The Gelato was ok, at best.  And the bad thing was that they had Costco muffins for sale.  ah, that's not good.  at least be creative.

I have had mixed results with this place.  Sometimes the ice cream is more like just cream.  It's soft.  In addition, I think the owner must take off and let the high school kids run the whole operation.  Sometimes the service is just terrible......

I stayed at the hotel for the weekend.  I THINK THIS PLACE IS GREAT.   I stay at a lot of hotel so have some reference.  I read reviews on yelp and was a little skeptical.    1) Great location (right in heart) 2) very clean & modern rooms 3) good price.  we paid $106 night.  Go directly to website.  You can sign up for "AAA" rate.  They did not ask for the card. 4)  Great shops.  high ends stuff...with good coffee & choices.  Overall, I was super impressed.

Keep on driving by.........  I don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.  Both coffee and espresso have no taste.  To boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.  Move on to the next place.......

This place is cool.  It has a good layout......TV if you want to watch a game...and great selection of beers with cold glasses.  Five guys own it together & we bullshitted with them for a while.  good guys....and they really care about doing a good job.  The food is excellent.  The sweet potato fries are awesome...and the burgers or good as well....lots of flavor.  The only drawback is that it's expensive for what you get.  A small slider is $5.  and you can easily eat 3 plus fries.  so with a beer you're talking $25, which seems high for burgers.  But, it's worth going to......great people.

On a scale from 1 to 10, this place is a 2.  I eat a lot of pizza.......and I can honestly say it's downright awful.  It tastes like cardboard with canned sauce on it.  I don't own a pizza place & I have no reason not to be objective.  With all of the choices we have in PHX, I wouldn't recommend this place.  You're probably wondering why others voted this 5 stars and now you're reading a 1 star.  The only thing I can think of is that some of the reviewers: 1) either don't eat good pizza or 2) they know the owners.  I can't understand, for the life of me, understand how people are voting this 5 stars.

Grab your ankles.......too expensive for what you get!!!  The food tasted great.......we split some dishes.....pork chops.....and mostly pasta.  The food was good quality....but pasta was running $20+ dish.  That's just too expensive for the small portion

I read several of the reviews & they are consistent with what I've experienced.  I've been to this place about 5 times...both for lunch...and late night.  The food is actually pretty good.  I've had the BBQ pork & fries and it was very good.  At night, the place is fun.  They have the bull to ride...and it's interactive to meet people.  But, the BIG, BIG drawback is the service.  Seems like other people have had the same experience -  it's downright terrible.  Every single time I've been there I've had some issue (I'm not that picky either).  The service is very, very slow.  They hired some hot girls..but they certainly aren't the brightest.  The charged my friend for several drinks that we didn't have...and it took them almost 1/2 hour to correct it.  Because of the service, I can only give this place 2 stars.  Good food but I think it's run by a high Shool student.

I heard so many good things about this place......but I was just not impressed.  On a friday night, it's a long wait....I'm talking an hour.  The food was just ok.  It was not special.  There were four of us and we shared a little of everything.  3 out of 4 agreed that it was below average.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing.....but I did not like it.

I must first confess that I did not eat here so take this review with that context.  I'm reviewing this simply from a beer & service standpoint.  First, I like the atmosphere.  They did it in dark wood.  The place has music...but it's not too loud.  The beer selection is great.....and I had a fantastic experience with service.  The bartender was very attentive and a good conversationalist.  I would go back again.

The bar itself, for drinks only, is ok.  It's very alpha-male but ok.....I can live with that.  The food is TERRIBLE.  Myself and three others ordered different items.  I got the pulled pork...and it was about as good as wendy's.  Even the hamburgers were below average.  Not just me saying this...three of my buddies as well.  bottom line -- ok for a beer or two but skip the food for sure.

I think this place is a lot of fun.  It's in a nice complex that's not your standard strip mall.  I've been 2x and both times were fun for dates.  They had live music...and a good wine & beer selection (not just bud light).  I have not had too much food so will not comment.  The atmosphere is cool -  sofa and chairs, a bar...or standard tables.  but, it's a funky cool place.............and we just don't get that too much in Chandler.

I found Kathy's from yelp.  I love to support local businesses and she was really friendly on the phone.  I only had a few pairs of jeans to tailor to the right length.   Kathy was great.....very friendly and chatty.  But, I got 6 pairs of jeans back......and every single one was too long or too short.  I spent $150 on tailoring and I ended up having to bring them to someone else.  I'm not sure how you screw up on jeans.....seems pretty basic.  If you're having anything major done, like wedding or prom related, I would not recommend Kathy.  ouch, sorry to say that...but to mess up on simple jeans is not a good sign for anything major.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because how nice Kathy was....but for business overall it's like a 1 star.  sorry

First, I'm not a family member or direct friend of this dentist.  I've been going there for years and have been very happy so want to write a review.  Dr Dominick (I call him Sam) is the owner and only dentist there.  The guy is solid.....he always gives me options to help keep the costs down but also pick the best option.  I've had some back luck with dentists in the past.  But, I trust Sam with a sack full of money......he would not touch it.  Bottom line:  this guy is a solid dentist, and honest person with great customer service and care.

First, I don't know any of the owners and I"m not friends with anyone at this place.  this is just an honest review.  Overall, this is a cool place.  Most important, the coffee is good.  It's not burnt like starbucks.  it has free internet.  The place is very clean, has lots of seating inside and plenty of parking.  The only reason 4 out of 5 is that it's a bit sterile.  it's not your typical "coffee joint" like a hippy place.  it's kinda like starbucks feel but better coffe.  the other reason is no real selection of morning food.  no muffins or pastries.  conclution:  recommended as a solid option

I've been there 3 times now and it's just fantastic.   I got Bob's big burger. 2/3 pound with a nice, big bun. it's very good.   it's a nice, southwest feel inside. quality wood, nice bar, nice wine area.   If you have guests in town, this is a nice view into our southwest style food.   Suggest you make reservations if it's thur, fri or sat night. Can be hard to get in.   Highly recommended.

Keep on walking......  My friend and I each tried different dishes and shared.  He got nice roast and I got a hamburger.  The place is really nice....open, bright....  ..but the food is just a BIG disappointment.  A hamburger + 2 good beers was $37.   Expect to pay a lot for your food here.  Both dishes were poor.....  sorry, really wanted to like this one....
