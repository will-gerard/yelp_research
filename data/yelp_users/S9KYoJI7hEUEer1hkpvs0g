They regularly get my order wrong. I'm partially to blame since I keep going back. I'm almost willing to drive a few miles just to try a different store.

I've used Specialized Auto Glass since 2007. I first chose them because they were the glass installer at Scottsdale Bentley/Scottsdale Ferrari until R. Penske decided he wanted everything done in house (no contractors). Being the go to company for luxury and exotic autos means they do quality work. I've had windshields replaced by them on 3 different vehicles over the years.

The food was okay. The service was atrocious. Don't go on a holiday weekend as they are not equipped, staffed, or prepared to handle any sort of a crowd. I made reservations, confirmed the reservation earlier in the day, and showed up on time. I was then told that it didn't matter if I had a reservation, there was a 45 minute wait. Since going anywhere else without a reservation would result in the same wait, we said okay and my name was added to the bottom of the list behind any walk-ins. Once we were sat, we were told Cliff would be with us shortly. A few minutes later, a woman who I assume was not "Cliff" brought us water and bread. About 5 minutes after that she asked if we wanted any drinks besides water. Finally, after sitting for 20 minutes, she asks if we have any questions. At this point, we have been sitting patiently, menus down (universal sign for ready to order), for 20 minutes assuming that she was just taking up some of the slack because "Cliff" was swamped. We placed our order and then waited an hour for the food to arrive. My Miso Glazed Swordfish was pretty okay, and the wife's King crab legs (2 for $50) were decent. Her grilled polenta, on the other hand, looked (and tasted) like some frozen patty someone slapped on the grill for char marks. I'll admit, being put at the bottom of the wait list even though I had a reservation soured my mood this evening, but my wife and I were amused that the most enjoyable moment we had was when we realized we could finally leave after paying the check. All said, I won't be returning to this establishment until there is a big banner stating "Under New Management".

This was a solid meh. It's not a place I would choose on purpose, but I would not say no if someone else wanted to go.

The food was pretty good which is why I gave them more than one star. I placed my order online through Eat24. This order included 3 (three) bottles of IBC root beer. When the delivery girl showed up, she handed me three bottles of Coca-Cola and said they were out of root beer. I understand running out of an item. Poor planning happens to any business. What I don't understand is automatically assuming you know what's best and substituting whatever you feel like or have the most of. You had my contact details from the order. Use them. I don't drink coke (which is why i didn't buy it), so I gave one coke to the delivery girl, one to my coworker, and threw the other in the trash. Live and learn.

Excellent. This is the first office I've been to where each instrument was identified and explained. Much better than sitting around with a hand in your mouth with no idea of what's going on. I met with Dr. K.

Those were some tasty tacos. Also, the ambiance was upbeat compared to any other late night taco spot I've been to in Phoenix or San Diego.
