The best lunch in Downtown Phoenix. I always get the gyro picado with feta cheese. But great salads the offer a healthy, low fat & carb options. If you are in the area I highly recommend.

Reminds me of the BIG theaters in L.A. Always clean and the sound in the theater is amazing. I recommend to everyone to go and experience this IMAX than any other in AZ.

No. No. No. This is not good pizza. Have been to this establishment twice and both times I was disappointed. The crust was burnt. The sauce tasted canned and the service(what service?) was below par.

Best local barber parlor period! From the nostalgic posters,books, and radio this place is a sure charmer for men who like the full service shave and haircut. The barber Matthew is a true barber with the technique and chatter that I have come to know and love in other cities around the country. Will definitely be a returning guest.
