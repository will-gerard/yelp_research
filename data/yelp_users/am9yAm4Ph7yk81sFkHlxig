What is up with crappy customer service in this town?!?  I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice, we have a multitude of hot sauces, chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection.  My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn't even ask if we wanted something different. Here is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, "Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu."  I couldn't believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn't even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out.  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off.  I won't be back.

I have been here many times over the years, even celebrating my 2 year anniversary with my sweetie here.  I like that they have an amazing selection of cheese, my total weakness.  Recently we went to one of their specialty dinners and the experience was top notch.  Basically it is family style seating with a long table with room for 12.  You learn about wine from a certain region and food to compliment it.  It was 3 courses and 3 wines all for $45!  The portions were big enough that when I go again I am going to half everything so I have a great next day meal. I found out about these dinners through FaceBook because I am "friends" with the host.  What was great though is when we walked in for the dinner he recognized me     and remembered my name, true customer service.  On Mondays they have 2 flat bread pizzas and a bottle of wine for $20 you can't beat that!

I love Community Florist!  I use them to get bimonthly flowers to decorate my salon and I also used them for my wedding.  They worked with my budget and I couldn't believe how many flower arrangements I got for what I spent. I was also able to make payments which really helped.  My bridal bouquet was absolutely stunning and matched my personality and accented my dress.  Their prices are amazing as well and they can work with any budget.  Over the last year I have purchased arrangements to celebrate birthdays, love, accidents and even death.  I can go in there and give them a bit of history of why I need an arrangement and tell them a bit about the person and they create the most perfectly beautiful personalized one.  You can also get amazing terrariums created here as well.  They also have classes on floral arranging.  Thank you Community Florist for bringing such wonderful flowers into my life!

I went here to get a birthday book for a friend and walked out with 2 huge stacks of books for less than $100!  I got mostly cookbooks and the quality was great as was the prices.  I have a book addiction and am running out of space on my bookshelves but I will be back!

I have hesitated before to give not so great reviews to places, especially when they seem to be a valley institution and they are family run, however the whole reason we use Yelp is to help us make decisions on where we want to spend our hard earned money.  When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes: Even though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago. Taco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh. Basically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review. Oh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.  The ATM in the front charges a fee, I wonder who gets to pocket that fee?

I love Beaver!  Beaver Stripes that is.  Trixie had been beaten up, keyed and her stripes looked so sad.  This made me sad so on a recommendation from another shop I brought my girl to get spruced up.  She looks so much happier and pretty now!  The price was also about $200+ less than some other quotes I received and it was a complete stripe replacement.  They dropped my car off at my work as well, which was great because I didn't have time to go get her.  Thanks Beaver!

They are right down the street from my house and when I had a check engine light come on they were able to repair everything the same day.  I could go on and give boring details, but it basically boils down to the fact that they are friendly and efficient!

After cracking a tooth on Monday I called a few places and Dr. Woodbury was able to see me a short 3 days later.  When I arrived they were able to take me promptly, being on time is very important to me and most places I have been to there has been a wait.  There was some confusion on my part, I thought that I made it clear that I needed the tooth to be fixed asap and they had booked me for and exam only.  But after realizing my dismay of not being able to fix it right away they made the time.  I had taken most of the day off of work and wasn't sure when I would have been able to come back.  I was worried that it might have been a rushed job but my concerns were unwarranted.   I have always been the nervous type when it comes to going to the dentist, hence I need some major work done now.  I couldn't believe how utterly painless the whole procedure was, even the shot of novocain, I didn't even feel it!  I had a filling a few years ago at another place and the quality of workmanship by Dr. Woodbury really made me realize what a hack that other dentist was.  My tooth feels so smooth! I already made my next appointment and will be seeing him every month until my smile is perfect.  I also like that even though I was able to pay for everything I needed today, when it comes time for the more expensive work, they will work with me on a payment plan.

I am blessed to have a Sunflower withing walking distance of my salon and another within bike riding distance of my house. I love this place! I usually get my lunch from here a few times a week and it fits into my budget nicely. I usually will get a cup of soup and have never been disappointed in the quality and tastiness. Today I had their homemade meat lasagna for the first time and boy was it good! The produce selection is wonderful with great prices and there is a wide selection of bulk items. I am a cheese fanatic and like the wide array to choose from.  There herb and vegetable plants are usually 2 for $5, a very inexpensive way to start your own garden. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and I have even special ordered essential oils from here.

I have been a patron of Kyoto for 15 years, in fact went on a really bad date there when I was 21.  Even though the date was painfully bad it didn't ruin my taste for Kyoto.  Now I love sushi and have been to many places in town so I have much to compare it to.  But the reason I come here more than any other place is I can enjoy a great sashimi lunch for less than $10 dollars or come have dinner plus drinks for around $25.  That makes me and my wallet very happy.  I walk to it from work and have lunch usually once a week. Have taken 3 of my stylist who have never been there before and turned them in to Kyoto fans.  The service is great, really friendly and I like that they recognize me always asking "how's business?  Good to see you again!"  It is another place here in old town that make me feel like I am not lost in the tourist shuffle.

LET IT BE KNOW THAT I DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY WORK DONE HERE!  Ok now that I got that out of the way....  Why would I write a review on a place I have never been you ask? Here is a copy of a note I wrote on Facebook:   So I a a bit confused about the business practices of AAMCO located on Scottsdale Road just south of Thomas, maybe someone out there in facebook land can help me understand this weird trend a bit better.   Sunday afternoon there is a knock on my door and it is a salesman. I don't realize this right away, I thought it was our neighbor or I wouldn't have opened the door. This overly gregarious guy hands me a coupon and begins his "buy this stuff speech" right away. It is a great deal, you buy a punch card and for roughly $80 you get 5 oil changes and a plethora of other neato, keep your car running in top notch condition services. I it thought how great it was because not even 1 day before I realized I was overdue for an oil change. But I was not about to give my credit card info, address or cash to some stranger standing in my doorway.   To try to understand better a concept that shouldn't be hard I started asking questions:   "So they only way to get this deal is to buy it from you right now?"   "Yes."   "Well I don't feel comfortable giving you all my information just because you say you are selling these coupons and are wearing an AAMCO shirt. You can understand my hesitation right?"   "Well it is a secure transaction ma'am. All your information is sent right here by satellite but this nifty gadget I have secured to my belt."   "That is all fine and good but I would prefer to just go to the business directly and purchase this deal."   "You can't, they don't offer this deal."   "What? I am sorry, did I hear you correctly? You are selling a punch card that I am going to be using at the business that will be honoring these cards but they don't sell it directly?"   "We are a different company ma'am."   "But you are wearing an AAMCO shirt."   "That is because our company, which is different, is selling something that can be used at AAMCO."   "Yea, I think I am going to....   I hadn't even finished my sentence when asshole grabbed the flyer out of my hand and says "Well I am going to give this to someone who understands the value and will buy it."   Listen jerk I do understand the value of it. I also know that identity theft is a real problem in this county now. Just because you are wearing some t-shirt that says AAMCO on it and are carrying some flyers doesn't make you legit. Oh and bucko, just for the record, anyone can have a remote credit card processor, it doesn't make you any more special than the next Joe Bob that comes to my door.   Feeling a bit miffed and also concern for AAMCO I give them a call. I wanted to make sure it was the real deal and and I wanted this family owned business to know how I was treated. As a business owner I know how important it is to make a great impression and they were not shining like a new penny to me. I was informed that there is an outside company that sells these coupons but they have nothing to do with them.   "So you honor these coupons but it is a different company that actually sells them?"   "Yes."   "If I came into your shop could I get the same deal? I would just feel better having my information and credit card run at an actual establishment."   "No we don't have that special, you would have had to buy it from that guy."   "So you are willing to let my business walk out the door when I was ready to come down today and get my oil changed but only if I could get that deal."   "I am sorry but we don't sell that deal."   "Wow, ok."   "I appreciate your call though and letting us know about the guy selling the coupons. If you want I can find the number so you can call that company directly."   "You do realize that whether or not that guy works for another company he was selling something to be used at your establishment, therefore he is representing your business. Because of how rude he was to me and the fact that for some unearthly reason you can't or won't give me the same deal there is no reason for me to give you guys a try."   "Sorry."   Click     I JUST DON'T GET IT!!   I own a business, I would never, ever turn away business, shoot I would even take competitors coupons!  I drive by this place everyday on my way to work. I have seen the mechanics out front holding arrows that say "no waiting right now!"  or something similar to get customers.  Why oh why would you turn me away?

I came here to get a battery replacement after work one day and Leo helped me out. My battery was still under warranty which was great since I had just got back from Christmas vacation! But what made this experience a great one was I received an education on corrosion. Leo not only explained to me what it can do to your engine if not properly handled but then he proceeded to spend a good amount of time cleaning my battery connectors to help alleviate the problem. This Auto Zone is on my way home and I will definitely use it in the future...

I eat here all the time and have been for a few years now.  I eat Pho anytime I am feeling sick and it knocks the illness on it's ass!  I went to pick some up since my man had a sore throat and I knew it would make him feel better.  For $15 I got Chicken Pho, crab puffs and spring rolls. $15 dollars!  This fed myself, my man and his brother.  It was a Monday night, the place was packed but it still took only 10 minutes to get my food.  While I was waiting 2 of my friends walked in.  Winner winner chicken dinner!

When I moved from Phoenix to Tempe 6 years ago (even though I am back in Phoenix now) I picked a place that was within walking distance of Casey Moore's because I love it so much.  The food is great, much better than bar food, which is what some people mistakenly think they are going to get.  $4 will get you a super strong well drink, I have been knocked on my ass more times than I care to think about from their pours.  The staff is great and really does know your name.  I have been kicked out but they always let me back it.  Once after a bitchy girl started screaming at me and calling me names for no reason, the owner offered to kick her out simply because he knows I am a regular and would never fight in his bar.  That is customer service at it's best.  I miss you Casey Moore's, I don't go often enough anymore... I must change that...

Dear Mr. Bianco,  I am writing this to bring your attention to the rudeness of your hostess that was working 2/19/11. If you have more than 1 hostess let me narrow it down for you, short dark hair and glasses. I myself am a business owner and no matter how great your product is, amazing customer service is also an integral part of the the overall experience. I have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long.  Back to the night at hand. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dining elsewhere in hopes of grabbing a pie to enjoy the next day. We were holding the door open for those that were exiting, those that were being ushered in to their seats and those that were putting their name on the waiting list. When there was a lull said hostess says "Yes?" Not, "How may I help you?" or "Hi" or anything that could be construed as gracious, friendly, hostessish. My boyfriend states that we were looking to get a pizza to go. Miss Crab-Apple, my new moniker for her, states, no haughtily sniffs, "We don't DO orders to go when there are people waiting." Then she turns and walks away. She doesn't even ask us if we want to put our names down for a table.  Mr. Bianco we didn't know what your kitchen's policy is for takeout, maybe you should have a sign that is in huge letters right on the door: NO TAKEOUT WHILE OTHERS WAIT! I am sure that would clear it up for those of us that simply wanted to spend our money on your food, just not eat it there.   Thank you for your time,  D'Lisa Shayn

I am so disappointed in my treatment from the Luxor after reporting that I had items stolen from me.  Here is a copy of the email I wrote to them at the beginning of September.  I had to follow up myself, more than once, to see the outcome of my claim.  Basically today I was told that after the "internal investigation" the woman Lisa in lost and found said she didn't steal my things.  Again, it could have been anybody working in Lost and Found during those 4 days before it was sent back in the mail.  My response to the man working on my case was " no one is going to admit to stealing!"  Basically I got a "sorry lady."  He never said he interviewed anyone else either.  I felt like my claim was just swept under the rug.  The way the investigator treated me it was as if I was the one pulling a fast one!  For a company this size compensation would have been nothing to them.  Having to replace all the items I just bought cost me an extra $450.   I am staying at this hotel in December for a bachelorette party, but after that I will never be back again!   Shame on you for being so blase about this matter!  You have thieves working for you!    Here is the email: I am writing to you to bring to your attention theft of my belongings while they were in your care. I stayed at your hotel August 15th for one night, reservation was under Jayson Khademi and D'Lisa Ledgewood. When leaving in the morning I left my backpack on the bench at valet and once I realized this I called right away. Lisa at lost and found informed me she has my bag but since it didn't have any identification in it we went over what was inside. Right on top I had a gallon bag filled with skin care products, most of them were brand new because I purchased them right before my 2 week road trip. Lisa even joked that I had quite a bit of skin care items and I told her that I was a salon owner in Scottsdale and an Aesthetician so my skin has to look amazing. She told me how to go online to claim the bag and have it sent back to me. We were on our way to Sedona and the cabin we were going to be staying out didn't have internet. I told this to Lisa and informed her that I would fill out the necessary forms when I got home on Sunday. When I received my bag back 90% of my skin care items were not there. I am not in anyway accusing Lisa, I am sure there were many people working at that station from Thursday until the next Monday that could have had access to it. But because of the conversation I had with Lisa I know all my products were there when the bag was turned in.  List of the missing items and their cost, all were Bioelements which are found exclusively in salons: Moisture Positive Cleanser $34 Advanced Vitamineral C Complex $50 CreataFirm $62 LightPlex $60 Sunscreen $42 Sleepwear $62 LiLash $140  Total cost of products stolen $450  I had to go an repurchase all of these items at a cost of $450. The way I see it my one day trip to your hotel cost me an extra $900! I have been staying at the Luxor for 19 years. I have always been satisfied with the service until now. It was bad enough thinking I lost my bag so imagine how happy I was to know that it was turned in with all my things still in it. Imagine how incredibly angry and disappointed I was when it was returned to me with so many items missing. I will not b returning to your hotel and I will be writing this on my review on Yelp. If we as guest can't trust your staff, who can we trust when at your hotel?

This is a short review.  The burgers are some of the best I have ever had. The people watching is entertaining and the outdoor seating is awesome on a beautiful day.  I have been coming here for 20 years and have always had a good time.

I was going to give it 2 stars because my server was super nice and great at accommodating my requests, which were numerous, but it really is a one star establishment. The menu is horrible with very little choices and geared towards how men eat. Very lame and the prices are outrageous but of course they can get away with it since it is at the airport. I ordered a lime infused chicken an brie sandwich but I ordered it without the chibatta bun because the last thing I want is a huge sandwich before I get on a plane. I am actually eating this right now. So far I have received a dry piece of chicken with caramelized, barely, red onion, roasted red pepper that I wouldn't call roasted at all. I couldn't taste any lime at all, they left off the "chiffonade" of fresh basil, the brie and the garlic aioli mayonnaise! Are you kidding me! What about "no bun" does the kitchen not understand? I got the brie and the aioli served on the side, the brie was cold of course. Hello, melted brie it says on the menu and it was some weird brie spread, totally gross. I sent the whole thing back to be melted and it was redelivered to me in, I swear, less than a minute. Still minus the basil. I sent the whole damn thing back, made them take it off my check and will never visit this place again.

My boyfriend and I are both passionate about cooking so we actually don't eat out much but enjoy coming up with innovative dishes in our kitchen, but everyone needs to have a romantic night out. It wasn't planned just a quick text, "I have golf at 11 today but how about going out to dinner tonight?" Yes sir sign me up. I have never been to Cork n' Cleaver even though I have lived in the valley for 21 years but have always wanted to go. We didn't have to wait and got a great table on the patio. We ordered both a steak entree and the lobster tail. Before they arrived we took a trip to the salad bar. I really liked that they had unusual food choices like caviar, but had to be mindful not to fill up on salad. The food arrived in a timely manner and my steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare. The lobster tail was a bit on the small side but tender and juicy. The potatoes were nothing spectacular, but they aren't why people come to this establishment. I ordered wine by the glass and it was a generous pour. To top off the meal we had creme brulee cheese cake which was to die for. As per usual what ever wasn't consumed outright was made into breakfast the next day. The steak was used in an omelet, the potatoes smashed and baked, all still wonderful the next day. The place had a comfy home feel and I would most assuredly go back.

Ants!  Ants!  Ants seemed to be everywhere!  I tried all the usual home remedies I could think of but for 3 days straight I would find a line of ants from the front door of my salon to a certain trash can located right under my tea station.  Not good, not good at all.  I called pretty late in the work world, around 7 pm but I was able to wrangle an appointment for the next morning.  The were able to squeeze me in around 10:30 and I haven't had a problem since.  They even gave me extra ant traps, no extra charge.  I will be using them again for all my spraying needs.  Thanks guys!

Buying a house can be a somewhat traumatic experience, your expectations of what you want doesn't always jive with what you can afford.  But using Jeremy as my broker made the experience so much better than I anticipated!  He worked so hard to get me the loan I needed and even celebrated with me when we closed on the house.  His customer service is superb and I would recommend him to everyone, he does not disappoint!

Totally pissed at this place right now!  I have been here twice, once for a newborn puppy that ended up passing away and last night for our American Bulldog that is 9 and passed out.  First time the people were kind, compassionate and helpful when explaining that newborn pups commonly die.   Last night and this morning they were definitely not and it wasn't the same staff.  My husband rescued Rouh at 5 months old and he is nothing short of a kid to us.  We know that he is really getting up there in years so when he passed out and had labored breathing we left the house in our pjs and without my husband's wallet.  Rouh was admitted right away and we payed for the critical care option which is around $230.  After a few hours they gave us a prognosis and another outline of what could possibly be done further at at cost of $1250.  Now by this time he was pretty stable, on IV fluids but we were beat, my husband had just worked 2 days of doubles, he owns a gourmet food truck and could barely see straight. The list they gave us was a lot to digest not to mention the steep price tag. We asked if we could go home and get some sleep and see how he is doing in the morning since he was still on an IV.  The attendant asked the doctor who said it was fine but that they couldn't run anymore tests or do x-rays until they got payment upfront.  I said that the fact that we are so tired it would be negligent on my part to drive home, get more money and drive back.  I had no interest in falling asleep at the wheel.  The attendant's response, "we are all tired."  Seriously?!?  This is your job, these are the hours you are at work.  Being up at 3 a.m. is not normal for us!  We were under the impression that it was ok to leave him there and come back in the morning.  Guess not since we got a phone call around 4:45 a.m. and another at around 6.  It was the new shift and they were extremely rude!  They said we can't start anymore treatment without payment, yep understood that when we left.  They also said if we didn't come get our dog by 7 a.m. he would be considered abandoned and they would have to call it in.  WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THAT!!???!!!  Don't you people communicate with each other?  The doctor gave us "permission" to go home and come back in the morning to figure out exactly what further treatment we wanted to do.  Instead my husband, after getting barely 2 hours of sleep went back and picked him up.  We had an epic food competition planned today with 4 judges and 25 people in attendance but canceled it because my husband is so tired from lack of sleep. If he could have slept, uninterrupted, for just 5 hours we could have pulled it off, but this place called us within an hour and a half of us getting home demanding more money or for us to come get him.  The worst customer service I have experienced in a long time.  We will be taking him I our regular vet on Monday.  I hope to never have to use this place again but unfortunately they are the only one close to me that I know about.  We were treated like we were low class, couldn't pay and that we might abandon our dog, not like the people we are.  We collectively own 3 businesses between us, give back to the community and treat people with respect!  This place needs a lesson in that.   Oh and one other thing, they charged us another $150 when my husband picked him up saying it was to cover the cost of another IV bag.  Wouldn't that have been covered on our first payment when the paperwork stated "fluids"?  Totally hosed us because they can..

I usually go to those drive thru one that cost about 7 dollars so I decided to try a hand wash for $10.  I just did the exterior because I was in a hurry and I was very happy with how quick and efficient they were.  My car looks better than when I take it to the drive thru so I don't mind paying a few more dollars.

I have been to St. Francis about 5 times now and every time I am completely satisfied with everything from the ambiance, to the service, to the amazing food.  I want to touch on just one menu item, the Eggs Benedict.  I haven't been able to eat said food for about 5 years now after a horrible food poisoning experience in Mexico brought on by bad hollandaise.  It is my fiance's favorite breakfast food and every time he orders it I try it and every time I can barely choke it down.  Not the case here!  I tried it, I loved it, I wish I ordered it myself!  I ate not only a bite or two of his, but our dining companion as well.  Just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water.  In a good way.

I was in a roll over car accident and went to Phoenician Health Group for help.  The staff is wonderful and got me back into tip top shape in no time.  I liked how each time they asked extensive questions about my overall health.  I highly recommend the Phoenician Health Group for not only chiropractic care but massages and nutritional care.

I love conspire for a multitude of reasons, first John Sagasta makes a mean cup of coffee.  Second I love that there are many local artists featured, I bought my sister a one of a kind vase as her wedding present.  It was so beautiful and perfect!  Third I really like that you can get one of a kind clothing as well.  Lastly they are always having special events like poetry night or kickball games.  Very cool!

Worst service ever!  I am giving it 2 stars because the bathroom toilet is my new lover.  But seriously worst service ever.  Our waitress was such a bitch she actually rolled her eyes and sighed while one of my dining companions asked her questions about the food.  Really?  She had no problem sitting with the 2 dudes at the table right next to us, being little miss flirty flirt.  Every single drink we ordered came without a garnish.  Dirty martini up with olives is not hard.  Vodka tonic always comes with a lime.  Twice we actually went to the bar ourselves to get the garnish.  Totally lame.  I wish I got our servers name so I could personally lambast her here on Yelp.  The manager tried to smooth things over, but when a situation sucks that bad just saying sorry isn't enough buddy.  This place can kiss my ass.

Either I am just easy to please or have been getting damn lucky on the places I have been spending my money at. Anyhoo, I went to Maizie's last night for $3 burger night, best 3 bucks I have ever spent on a burger! First off though when we got there it seemed like we would have a bit of a wait, not so! Waited less than 10 minutes which was awesome because I was starving. For an appetizer ordered the buffalo wing dip, so freaking delish I could have eaten another! I had bacon and pepper jack cheese added to my burger but it was so filling I could only eat half. My breakfast this morning, the other half! Tastes great heated up too. For my taste beverage I had lemonade which was perfect, not to sweet, not to sour. The staff was attentive and the people watching was great. This wasn't my first time at Maizie's and it won't be my last either.

I have now been here 3 times and my first time was great, as I stated in my first review.  But my last 2 visits have not been a pleasant experience.  I went for brunch a few months ago with a group of ladies, 25 of us, and our service was pretty terrible.  First we had confirmed the number of people in our party the day before but they still seemed unprepared for such a large party.  Our server was pretty rude as well, I swear she never cracked a smile.  Our party arrived within 30 minutes of or reservation time, some right on time others a little late and we had the large center table and 2 booths.  Our server stated after only 15 minutes and 12 of us being there that she couldn't hold the tables if we all weren't coming.  We assured her we were and everyone did show up.  It was the continual little things, not refilling water, not bringing fresh, chilled orange juice when we ordered another bottle of champagne for mimosas.  Rolling her eyes and sighing when we asked for the check to be split and never saying thank you before we left. Last night was so bad I won't be back.  I met with a friend for their pizza and wine special which I was super excited for.  The biggest problem was the bartender, she was rude, inattentive and totally cut corners when it came to making us happy.  We ordered a pizza and one of our toppings was goat cheese but only on one half.  When our pizza arrived it had mozzarella on one half and goat cheese on the other when the mozzarella should have been on the whole pizza.  This is a totally honest mistake and I can see where the confusion could have been in what we said and what she translated it to mean. But instead of apologizing she was a bit argumentative over what she thought we said when we ordered.  To make matters worse instead of having a new pizza made she asked the kitchen to just add the mozzarella on the side that was missing it and re-fire it.  What?!  It was charred in some places, dried out and all together simply not very good.  We were starving and contemplated sending it back, but twice in one night just seemed too much.   There was a nice gentleman that worked there who asked how are pizza was, bartender chick never did, we actually had to get her attention the first time to send it back.  We were in the middle of explaining why we didn't really like it when Ms. Snarky says "if you wanted me to have a new one made for you, you should have just asked."  WTF?!  I have worked in restaurants and usually when someone sends something back you remake it!  You should have done that in the first place!  She was so rude and it was really hard to even be polite to her at this point but I remained in the acting like a lady zone.  The did take it off our bill and gave us a free dessert.  Let me be clear, it was the gentleman who gave us the free dessert, he was very charming and apologetic.  If Ms. Snarky was nice about everything I wouldn't be writing off Maizies forever, but the icing on the cake was when she sat at the bar one seat down from us to eat her dinner.  I think that is very unprofessional but that wasn't what bothered me most.  The lady that took her place behind the bar and Ms. Snarky had a 10 minute bitch fest complaining about customers and how they can be such a pain in the ass.  The proceeded to regale each other with stories of how customers have annoyed them.  We paid our bill and left.  Ms. Snarky didn't say one word to us on our departure.  There are so many great places in the same area with a much nicer staff.  Those are the places I will be spending my money at.

The Tuck Shop is such a wonderful place!  I have been there twice and every time I have been wowed by the food.  I do admit though the cheese curds were a little to salty for me, but I did have more than 1!  The lamb meatballs were delicious and not gamey at all, which I find with some lamb.  The brussel sprouts were amazing with the tiniest bit of crunch from the charred outer leaves.   I have been twice and the first time was with a group of raucous women, we got pretty loud, laughing and just having an all around great time.  The staff seemed to welcome our rambunctious nature, we met the owner and the manager who both just came by the table to chat.   The second time was just a friend and myself.  We had to get some work done and decided to share all our plates, the server was wonderful about taking his time bringing each course out individually.  He seemed to get that we needed time in between to get back to work for a few minutes. The decor is warm and inviting.  I love that there waiting area is like a comfy living room.  It is a place that is at the top of my neighborhood favorites...

I had to review this place again because I have decided it is my favorite neighborhood spot hands down!  I went last night on a whim with my fiance after we both had a very long day and were starving.  The pasta fries were amazing and the dipping sauces that came with it was so good!  The skirt steak was cooked just right and the the potatoes were creamy heaven.   But the star of last nights show was the fish and chips.  It was the best fish and chips I have ever eaten, crispy, juicy and not greasy at all.  What a great way to top off our evening.  I can't wait to go back.

I can't say enough great things about the Tuck Shop!  I have been there a handful of times and every time they are gracious and inviting.  A few of those occasions I have been with a group of people and we always get loud and rowdy.  But I never feel like we need to calm down.  The owner and servers always remember me which make me feel oh so special!  The menu changes quite frequently but my absolute favorites, cheese curds and the skirt steak are staples that never change.  I am actually heating up my left over tomato casserole right now!  If you go on the night where the special is fish and chips, do not hesitate, order them.  The best fish and chips I have ever had.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them...

I went to Yogurtland for the first time today and was very happy for many reasons one being that it is right around the corner from my salon, within walking distance.  I can go for a brisk walk, treat myself and then work it off on the way back.  I know, it is frozen yogurt.  I did get the nonfat kind, 3 different kinds to be exact, with fruit toppings.  It was a healthy treat that kicked my craving for sweets for the rest of the day.   The flavor selection was diverse, unlike some other places, which I found very refreshing.  I had a blend of pistachio, my favorite nut, cheesecake, and boysenberry.  Eclectic mix, just like me.  The best part was the price, $2.17.  What?!  So much more economical than other places I have been.  I really felt like I got way more bang for my meager two bucks.  It will now become a  staple when it comes to treating myself to the better things in life.

I felt it was necessary to write about Yogurtland once again. I went on a Wednesday afternoon at 3 and was so surprised to see the line was at least 20 people deep. I thought it was going to be a long wait in line but the exact opposite. As a matter of fact it is 3:27 right now and I already enjoyed my tasty treat at the shop and drove back to work! I was pleasantly surprised that there were all new flavors to choose from. I got Dutch Chocolate with Reece's peanut butter cups, Peanut butter with brownie bits and Lemon Lime Tart with strawberries. Every combination was delish and the best part, $1.83! You read that right folks... But one of the main reasons for my update was the feeling of the place today. It had a sense of camaraderie, everyone turning to their neighbor to ask their opinion on certain flavors, taster cups weren't absent just not really being used. I think everyone realized we didn't want to be on the line ride long. The staff was as friendly as ever and everything was very clean. Even with that many people there still was seating. Me being a lone traveler in Yogurtland that day I shared a 4 top with a family of 3. It was a moment that reminded me of small town life where everyone gets to know their neighbor. Very nice.

I have been a patron of the original Lolo's for years and have to admit I like the colorful flavor and mix of people at that location. But I live in Tempe and own a business right down the street from the Scottsdale location. I went right after it first opened and even though it was so shiny and clean and didn't have the urban feel I love so much, I can't deny that the food isn't just as delicious! Everything I have ever had on the menu is heart stopping good, literally! I only partake of Lolo's delight a few times a year, but it is always craved!

This place isn't in my neighborhood but I wish it was.  For a Thursday afternoon at 2 there was a line, always a good sign.  I got the falafel pita which was nom nom delicious.  It also came with a greek salad that was fresh and crisp, lots of feta, tomatoes and olives.  The pita was thick and chewy the falafel crispy on the outside, soft and not dry on the inside.  There is a delicate balance when making falafel! For under $10 dollars I got a plate full of food and a glass of wine, perfect!

So I wanted something quick, fresh and economically savy for lunch today and decided on Chipotle even though it is a chain.  I have found a new lunch spot to add to my list!  I had the chicken bowl fajita style, the chicken was really juicy, the peppers and onions crunchy.  The sala fresco was fresh and the pinto and black beans were the perfect consistency.  For a little over $6 I have enough food to feed me for 2 meals.  The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly.  The only thing I would change is to offer brown rice as well as white, but I will definately be back.

I came here for the first time on a rainy Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend I hadn't seen in 6 months.  Our server who was cute as a button picked up our "we are not in a hurry vibe" right away.  We ordered a bottle of wine, fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass.  Our food was very good but no real risk was taken. We shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but I had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite.  The beans and white rice were a simple filler, nothing more.  The menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so I would definately try it again. There were only 2 things that I found disapointing, first was after we ate I ordered a martini, one from their menu, it was fruity and you couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  The problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and I feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger, not the James Bond shaken not stirred size. Second problem, as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door.  Now my companion and I couldn't decide if she worked there or not, she never ordered food and wasn't there long.  But just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me. Overall though I give the place a B+

Ok, I wince when thinking about writing a less than stellar review of a place but I was so disappointed in the Tempe Farmers Market. I walked in with my reusable cloth grocery bag planning on walking out with it filled. Instead I walked out with 2 tomatoes, that is it. The main reason was I felt the prices were really high on almost everything. I have a Sunflower market near my work and house and could get 3 times the amount of food for the same price. Also a lot of the produce looked a bit wilted and there really wasn't a great selection. The staff was friendly however and hopefully in the future the prices will be more reasonable. I still don't get how something that is grow or produced nearer than the stuff that gets trucked in is so much more. My pocketbook would not let me spend so frivolously!

I love this place! They have some of the freshest fish and a very wide selection. On any given night I can buy just what I need for dinner for 2, with leftovers, for around $10! The produce is of great quality and I can't seem to get enough of the pea shoots, amazing flavor to compliment anything from fish, chicken salads and soups. The staff is helpful and friendly, always smiling, I like that. Yesterday I bought a bundle of asparagus, 8 Japanese eggplants, 4 beefsteak tomatoes, a bag of enoki mushrooms, strawberries, grapes, garlic, a bell pepper, red lettuce and a bundle of green onions for $10.21. That is a savings of almost $10 off if I would have bought all that at a large chain supermarket. Mmm time to go make lunch!

Lobby's is within bike riding distance from my pad which rules since I really loved the burger but a petite girl like me has to be careful about what I stuff my face with and I will be eating many Lobby burgers! I had the basic burger with bacon and fries.  The size of the burger was perfect and cooked to perfection.  I loved the slightly charred crust and the flavor was robust.  I usually add condiments to my burger but left it as is trusting that the Lobby boys would know what tastes best and they certainly did.  The lettuce was crisp and the tomato was thick sliced and firm. I am for sure going to add cheese the next time, which is something I never do, but it just seems right.  The fries were just as good, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.    I think I have found a way to enjoy exercising more, ride to Lobbys and chow down then ride home.  Yea everyone wins!

I truly believe that it isn't just the food that makes a place but the service can be the real cherry on top, which is why I am going to start there. First I was impressed that on a quiet Tuesday the dining area was closed because there was a huge party coming in to take over the whole place. The bar area was open however and I am glad it was the only option because Carl, the bartender, made our experience! First all bottles of wine are $20 before 6 and we sampled 4 before making our choice. Sidebar, also there was a wine tasting going on with 2 patrons and one of the staff, not sure if he was the manager or owner, but super friendly as well. Back to Carl, he is the perfect bartender, personable, knowledgeable, chats you up but isn't intrusive at all. He also has a great stache and told me where to get stache wax for my dude, that rocks! He also gave us happy hour prices even though it didn't start for another 20 minutes. We ordered fried pickles which were thinly sliced, the batter was perfectly crisp and the garlic aoli was to die for. Next we ordered 6 types of bruschetta, salmon and capers, mozzarella, tomato and basil, goat cheese with roasted red peppers, apple and marscapone, hummus and chives and prosciutto and fig. Now I know there have been comparisons to Postinos, I love that place as well, but I am glad I can go right down the street now instead of across town. I do like that they cut them in threes instead of just half, more bite manageable. My companion and I both didn't like the salmon and capers, which is fine, but what was great was Carl heard us say it and brought out another one with chicken salad, on the house. Nice! I bill was less than $40 and I will definitely go back.

I go out to eat for lunch only a few times a month so I am always looking to try something new and close by. Touch of Thai is within walking distance of my salon so I wanted to give it a try. For less than $10 I got enough food for 2 meals which is awesome in my book. The cabbage and sprout soup that comes with the lunch special was a generous portion, would have actually been enough on its own. The broth was light and pungent while the sprouts and cabbage had the perfect consistency of soft but not soggy. I ordered the yellow curry chicken, my go to favorite Thai dish. The portions again were generous, the chicken was tender, the carrots crisp and the potatoes melt in your mouth. There was just enough kick to make my nose run. The salad had a nutty dressing that I almost asked for a side of to dip my won ton and mini egg roll in.  It is on my list of lunch places in Old Town. I can't wait for the weather to get cooler so I can walk over in a warm sweater and try some of their soups!

For the second year in a row I have turned to Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars for my Christmas present needs.  How can you go wrong with something that is the staple of our diets?  The price is right as well $15 a bottle no matter what kind you get.  Now I know you can get your average olive oil for roughly $6 at any grocery store, but once you try these you won't go back to simple store bought.  My favorite is Persian Lime, it really dresses up fish, chicken and is a great base for salad dressings.  There are simply to many to list but if I had my way I would have a bottle of each! The vinegars are amazing!  So full of flavor, bite and kick.  It is a KAPOW explosion in your mouth!  Right now I am stuck on the Honey Ginger and make a bread dip with that, the Persian Lime, pepper, garlic and grated Parmesan cheese.  It is as fine a dip as any you would get in a top notch restaurant. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, giving great suggestion on good mixtures.  They have a mailing list to tell you about their specials and have a rewards card program, 5 more bottles and I get one for free! It is one of my favorite gifts to give and receive (Hint, Hint!)

I have been wanting to get a massage since they added that to their menu and today they were running a deal for $35.  It was worth every penny!  I even dozed off a bit and I never do that.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean and it was really quiet during my massage.  I will definitely be back...

I have been a patron of Mabel's for a while now and I love this place.  The food is great, yea for the Mac and Cheese!  I have had everything on the menu and there isn't one item that I don't dig.  The staff is friendly and the ambiance is cozy and romantic.  What truly impressed me though is I was putting on a fundraiser and couldn't find a place that didn't want to charge and arm and a leg.  Mabel's let us do it for free!  Now a friend of mine spins there so I did have an in but still it was a show of amazing generosity.  They even gave us 20% of what the bar made that night!!  Beyond impressed.  Mabel's is at the top of my list for Scottsdale bars, no douchery, no snobbery, simply wonderful!

I have been a fan of Scandalesque for years, I even had one of the dancers perform at my second salon's Grand Opening party, what a treat that was.  I try to go to all their shows, whether it is a big production with many cast members or a small affair at FilmBar.  I already have my tickets for the next 2 shows coming up!  I also like that they teach classes.  The classes are not your basic workout either, you can truly channel your inner sex kitten.  This company just gets better with every passing year, bravo!

Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend.  The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table.  Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.  RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!

After talking to a client about Drunk Drivers and giving her the number I thought, "hmmm I wonder if they are on yelp?"  I can't rave enough about this service!  I now know that if I go out to dinner after work near my salon and become a little drunky bear, one phone call and me and my car will be deposited safe and sound at my house.  I believe it is a flat rate of $40 for a certain number of miles, I think 10.  All I know is in my drunky bear state I always pay $60, have to give both drivers a tip!  They are so amazing that one night I was going to ride with a friend but didn't want to leave my car so I call the Drunk Drivers.  They answered my call with "Well hello D'Lisa, we haven't heard from you in a while.  How are you?"  Loved that!  I told them my issue of not wanting to leave my car and asked if they could pick it up and drop it off at my house.  Of course the answer was yes!  I payed over the phone with a credit card, left my keys with the hostess and when I arrived home 4 hours later, there was my car all safe and sound.  I told the driver to just leave my keys in the mailbox, but since he saw another car in the driveway he knocked on the door, made sure it was my house and gave them to my fiance.  Sigh........ It is such a relief to be in such good hands.  I am drinking a glass of wine right now waiting to go to a VIP party in Old Town, pretty sure I will be calling you tonight....

I have been wanting to go to Nobuo since it opened. I was a huge fan of Sea Saw and was sad it closed. We went on a rainy Saturday night and was expecting a wait. Since we were ok with not having a table in the main dining room but along a bar on the wall we waited less than 5 minutes. We choose from each of the selections and all were exquisite, the pork belly buns were melt in your mouth delicious. The sea bass in parchment was, buttery, flaky and the enoki mushrooms added just the right earthy undertone. The table favorite was a light white fish that has hot oil poured over it with homemade foccacia. We ordered 2 we liked it so much! We also had the house cured salmon with basil oil, I had to stop myself from licking the plate. We had 3 more dishes, but you get the idea...   The only thing I would change is the pace of the service, it was way to fast to please me on a Saturday night date. The portion sizes are small and I would have like to savor them more. Unfortunately our servings were brought out so quickly we sometimes had 2 or 3 in front of us. Next time I will just ask them to slow their roll.  With 3 drinks, dessert and tip we spent roughly $130, well worth every penny. I will definitely be back~

This is the first time I have ever been to a BWW and ordered take out.  Now it was packed in there because of football but I didn't have to wait to long for my food.  I got 5 different flavors, sweet bbq, spicy bbq, asian zing, spicy garlic and medium.  I really liked the asian zing!  Courtney, who checked me out, was super busy but still took the time to check everyone's to go orders to make sure everything was there, great customer service.  The celery was missing from my order, an oversight on my part as well since we went over the order together.   My only problem was the packaging, what a huge waste! It seems they only have one size box and it is huge.  They really need to have smaller sizes and not be so wasteful.

I heard about Debbie Downey from one of my stylists who saw a special she was having on endermologie, 3 sessions for $45 each. I have been intrigued by this treatment and have always wanted to try it out. What is endermologie you ask? Well the pamphlet states: the first worldwide, patented, FDA cleared process scientifically proven to reduce cellulite. What I say is....awesome!  I have a gym membership that I hardly ever use, it is so hard to motivate to work out when I am on my feet working 6 days a week on average at least 10 hours a day. Now I had been thinking about getting weekly massages to pamper myself and help keep muscle soreness and tiredness at bay. But instead I am now getting the endermolgie treatments because it offers so much more than just a massage. It helps with detoxification, circulation, cellulite reduction, body sculpting, skin tightening and feels like a deep tissue massage.  I love it! I bought the first 3 and then bought a package of 10. To be honest though I know it will be a weekly service for me. One of the problems I have been experiencing this past year is my hip joints will start to hurt after so many hours on my feet. Since I have started having Debbie work on me weekly, I don't get that pain even remotely like I use to. I have also already noticed a difference in my body, my hourglass shape is more defined. My stomach is flatter, my skin tighter, my buns are a bit more lifted. A girlfriend of mine gave me a booty slap and said, "Damn girl! Have you been working out? Your ass feels great!" True story....  Debbie herself is wonderful and always works with me and my hectic schedule. I instantly felt her kindness and already consider her not only a service provider but also a friend.

So I have been here 3 times and I really wanted it to wow me each and every time but it simply doesn't.  First time I was with a friend and we were drinking more than eating so when my ridiculously expensive bill showed up I almost threw up all the $12.66 martinis I had drank.  Seriously?!?  The only place in town where I wouldn't freak on that price is AZ88 because one martini and you are almost done in.  Our server was friendly but I had to tell her to stop rushing us, she came back every 10 minutes or so wondering if we wanted our check.  I told her I would flag her down when needed but that we planned on being there a while. Second time I went for lunch and everything was ok but not amazing. Third time was last night and it will most likely be my last.  Every month 3 of my lady friends and myself try a new place, I actually was the one to suggest here. We started at the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for our whole party to arrive.  When it was time to move to a table our bartender asked us to close out our tab.  Didn't even offer to transfer it which is standard.  We ordered a started of cheese, roasted garlic, prosciutto, cornicons and oysters.  The little nugget of cheese we received was just that, a tiny little nugget.  Now I am a huge cheese snob, I have my very own travel bag from Venissimo Cheese shop in San Diego and every time I visit I come home with roughly $100 worth of cheese.  I know my cheese, I know the cost, I felt cheated that we each only got a nibble.  The oysters were good, not gritty at all, but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing, tabasco and crackers.  I ordered the beet salad which was middle of the road, but I did like that the beets didn't have a loamy taste.  One of my dining companions ordered the steak which was overcooked so she sent it back.  It came back better but with the same sides on the plate, they literally transferred what was on her original plate to the new one.  Terrible!  You don't let a plate sit under the heat lamp while you redo something, you make a whole new plate.  The worst part of the evening was after our appetizer our server informed us that it was almost 9 and the kitchen closes at 9.  WTF!?!  We are already seated, you know we are going to order dinner, there were at least 5 tables full in our section alone and you feel the need to rush our order?!?  Lame is a word that doesn't even do it justice.  To add the cherry on that lame sauce sundae, they kicked us out into the cold to wait for our ride!  It was freezing and all I had was a thin jacket WITHOUT gloves, I was shivering pretty bad by the time my fiance rolled up.  He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager. (Thanks for looking out babe!) I will finish this off with the positives, they had cocktail onions.  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find cocktail onion served in this town.  Second their system for splitting checks is hands down amazing with us each getting charged 1/4 of the appetizer price.  I haven't seen that before.  Third the decor is nice.

Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830.  My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1. Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead. Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3. My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4. My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5. Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6. Not even done yet...... At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes "when the party is over."  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7. She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting. At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8.   I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9 When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10. Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, "Ok they took a dollar off."  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11. I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back.

Bryan is very efficient and professional.  Not only has helped me with real estate questions but has helped many people I know.  This market is tough and he has weathered the storm.  He broad knowledge base in the industry is a great quality and because of that I have recommended him to many people.  Some agents' bottom line is their commission check which makes it feel rushed and impersonal, Bryan isn't like that.  He listens to your needs, wants and what you can really afford.  Home buying is a daunting task, but he makes it not as scary.  He is able to steer you in the right direction as well if you aren't really sure on what you want.  His personal, customized service makes him stand out in the industry.

I wasn't jazzed about this place at all.  I went with a friend for lunch and we were the only people there.  Our server was nice enough but seemed like she really didn't know what she was doing.  I ordered wine and it was brought to me in a totally soap spotted glass.  It was obvious it got the dunk and rinse but no wipe out cleanse.  The fact that the streaks were so noticeable and she still served my wine in that glass shows inexperience.  Second she brought my friend's drink to the table overflowing so much it was spilling out of the glass onto the floor because she wasn't using a tray.  She spilled all over the table and said, "sorry, I am not really a bartender," and walked away.  I figured she would come back to clean up the mess but instead I took      a napkin off another table and did it myself. On to the food, we got 3 different skewers, chicken, steak and ahi.  The steak was really good, perfectly cooked.  The chicken was pretty boring, nothing special and the ahi was terrible.  It had the consistency of gelatin and the manager apologized but also made excuses to why it could possibly be that way.  Every single dish has the same boring rice with diced carrots, peas and corn.  A bit strange and the plating itself was boring.   The dipping sauces were somewhat bland.  We also had to wait for the manager to go to the bank to get our change, I paid with a $100.....really? You don't have enough change on hand for that?

So glad I found this place!  I was going to another spray tan place right around the corner from my salon which was ok but not consistant on so many levels it was frustrating.  After not being able to get an appointment there I started looking for something close and found The Bronze Bar.  The place is really cute and clean!  Laura, the owner is super professional but also makes you feel right at home.  She is really attentive to detail and I have always been happy with my tan.  I even stopped by on a whim and she was able to squeeze me in so I didn't have to come super early in the morning.  This is most definitely my go to place in Scottsdale from now on.  In fact I have a tan with her tonight!

I have been seeing Aeimee Diaz for my acupuncture and overall well being for almost a year.  I was so happy when she moved to downtown Phoenix.  I had my first visit today at her new location and what a pleasant surprise it was.  It is a wellness center that has everything you could possibly think of for your holistic health care needs, even and herbalist who's shop is in the front.  Aeimee has help me get rid of coughs through cupping and helped my digestive issues through acupuncture and prescribing me Chinese herbal supplements.  I first started going to her for her amazing acupuncture facelift but she does so much more for me now.  As for the facelift you have 10 treatments, 2 a week.  It helps to lift, detoxify, build collagen and give you a younger fresher look.  The women in my family are plagued with a saggy skin on the jaw line and I am going to do everything I can to fight it!  After my initial 10 visits I now try to do once a month maintenance.  While I am there she does an overall review of my health and administers some needles where needed.   As for the needles themselves, it doesn't hurt, maybe a tiny pinch.  I really hate needles and use to feel anxiety before my appointments but that faded over time.  Aeimee's techniques is amazing and she spent 3 months in China learning even more than she already did in the states.  She learned the flying needle technique which has made her super fast in the placement of the facial needles, there are almost 100 in all! Right now I know she is having a June promotion as well, $950 prepaid for the 10 visits, total steal and worth every penny.   I have another appointment next week and am looking forward to it.   One last note, I feel like I am going to therapy every time I see her.  She is able to read what is going on with you emotionally by what is going on in your body and how that in turn effects your sleep, moods etc.  I don't feel shy about discussing my most private issues because I know she can help in all aspects.  There is even talk that the center is going to have an "urgent care" but using holistic medicine instead of what you would normally find at and urgent care.  I am all for that!  I am so glad I found my health care spot.

First I am an Aesthetician myself so I know a great facial when I get one!  I was in 7th heaven on her table and was really bummed when it was over.  She uses a great product line and my skin was absolutely glowing when she was done, I even got compliments on it that night at dinner.  Now as long as the products are good,  they are going to do the job, but what makes a facial great is the attentiveness during the process.  Her music was catered to my taste, I could tell she has an innate ability to know I didn't want the babbling brook or ocean sounds.  Dead Can Dance was playing softly in the background, an album that I love.  She not only pampered my face but my feet, hands, arms, shoulders and scalp as well.  I was like Jello when she was done.  I am pretty sure I might have even drifted off for a minute or two I was so relaxed!  Tiffany herself is such a wonderful woman and you can tell she loves her craft.  It is her passion not just a job and it shines through in every blissful moment.

I took Vincenssa, my 2006 Mustang, to Airpark Auto Spa for her very first ever detail.  I decided to spoil her, every lady deserves to be spoiled, and get her the $300 detail.  It was worth every penny and Ryan did an amazing job!  Not only was she shiny and looking like new, but the engine sparkled and looked cleaner than when I bought her!.  He replaced my floor pads and was able to get a salad dressing oil stain out of my seat.  I thought that spot would be there forever!  I also had trim on my door that had faded from the sun and he was able to remove those which made the car look even better.  The new car smell even lingered after a week.   I will be going back for sure.

I have to say I am a total fan of the food and our server Chad was great.  But I thought it was lame that he couldn't wear his eyelet earrings or his hair in a totally retro fohawk but all the women that worked there looked like they were dressed for a sexy night out on the town.  I don't mind that the ladies were all strutting around with all their naughty bits on display but give us lady patrons something to ogle too!  How about putting the guys in fitted shirts and allowing their personalities to shine through adornment and coiffed hair.   But back to the food, for an appetizer I tried the deviled eggs and they were wonderful and big!  No slacking on the portion size.  We were a large group so I got to sample the burger, grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomato bisque, the french dip and beef stroganoff.  Every single one was heavenly and delicious!  I also like the plating of the food.  I will be back.

I am going to keep this short and not so sweet. First there wasn't 5 guys, there was 3 guys and a girl.  Ok my attempt at humor might have failed but so did this place in my book. I spent 15 dollars on 2 burgers and 1 regular fry, way to much if you ask me.   They screwed up my order, twice. The first time I ordered a bacon burger with cheese all the free toppings minus the mushrooms, they put mushrooms on.  I sent it back and also asked them to leave off the gross, processed slop that they were trying to pass off as cheese. Also the first burger was a sloppy, soggy mess from the moment I opened the foil that it was wrapped in. When I went back to the counter I went over my order, slowly, thinking it would be right.  Since everyone had already eaten I took it to go without checking it, another mistake on my part.  They left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon.  You think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time, nope. I try to stay away from chain restaurants anyway, give my money to locally owned establishments, and this experience has solidified that notion.  I will stick with Lobby's thank you.

So it is true, I work in the same complex, but the customer service is then best in town.  Not to mention the food is amazing... A HUGE garden salad for less than 5 dollars?!!!  Awesome.  Seriously, one of the best burger shops in town.  Whenever I come in and am trying to be good and eat healthier it is so hard not to get one of their burgers because they are so damn amazing!!

I am in love!  Since the moment I walk in everyone has been courteous, genuine and just awesome!  The bartender showed us to a table, there has been at least 4 servers that have helped us and the food, oh Lordy help me, the food is drool worthy!  The chips, which are complimentary, are the best I have had in a long time.  The salsa is not a great ball of fire which is good on my book.  The guacamole we tried was the one with pineapple and mint. Mmmmm! Mmmm good!  We did want the one with bacon and they were out but whatever, we were happy campers.  The tacos we had were out of this world!  The Thai snapper snapped me back to my honeymoon in Thailand only last month.  I swooned and was transported back to the most romantic trip I ever took.  We also had the Peking duck taco with apricot compote, it got my taste buds ready for the holidays.  Michael was our main server and he was so personable and well versed on the menu, such a plus since they have only been open 3 days!  There is a jukebox so you can pick music and the frescos are custom made and have "The Masters" seriously check them out.

I just took my staff here for our holiday party and it was awesome!  I guess that on Sundays, or at least the day we went our passes were for all day play, so I felt like I got my money's worth for sure.  The food was good, our service was great and the laser tag was so much fun!  I can't wait to go back.  Don't let the rope gravity fool you, if you are afraid of heights it is a bit scary.  I couldn't finish it the first time, but faced my fears and finished the second time!  Overall I thought it was great!

Food trucks are really taking off here in Az and a new kid on the block, Chedda Truck is awesome.  Their burgers are not your run of the mill, example the Kill Me Softly with bacon, blue cheese, arugula, cranberry gastrique and the bun is a Krispy Kreme donut!  Whaaatt! Ps get the chedda tots, they come with a chipotle cream cheese dipping sauce!

This place pissed me off so much I can't even begin to see straight and it has been hours since I left.  All I wanted was to hopefully refinance my car for a lower rate then what I already pay.  I basically spent about 4 hours, Gave them 3 years worth of my financials, which shows that my business, correction, 2 businesses have grown exponentially and quickly every year since I have been open.  They, in the end denied me, even though my W2 and my profit and loss combined was very high for 2015.  It didn't matter that I showed them all my financials since 2012 and the yearly growth was more than impressive. I don't say this to brag, I was just so taken aback that they denied me because as a business owner I can write off quite a bit, but write offs actually work against you as a business owner. They didn't even take into consideration that I did a 60k renovation on one of my locations in 2015.  I spent 2 1/12 years saving money instead of having to borrow, but to them that didn't matter, because I paid for everything myself instead of needing a loan that worked against me. I have paid way over my monthly payment every month since I have bought the car and my business numbers prove not only am a profitable business owner but a growing one.  I thought a "bank" or credit union or whatever you want to call it would understand what it is like for small business owners.  I guess I was wrong.  It doesn't matter, I am sure I can find an institution that would gladly have me as a client.  So Arizona Federal you can sit and spin with your stupid algorithms and inside the box thinking.  You wasted my day and you really suck. Update: You have all my information so if you feel that you want to look at me and my business as a whole and step out of the box and realize I make more than enough money for you to refinance my loan then you can call me direct at 602-332-4032.  Other than that I don't feel I need to reach out to you again.  If you want to know more about me google my name D'Lisa Shayn Khademi (Ledgewood).  There are many write ups about me and my ever expanding business. Look up my business at www.salondshayn.com You will see that I would have been a great client to have.  But I am sure another institution will gladly take my business.

Oh the Valley Bar I want to love you so much but my last experience soured me so bad that I am not sure if I will be back. I now have been twice to go to the Blunt Club night because for me it is like a family reunion.  I have been going to Blunt since it started 13 years ago.  I am also one of those people that show up around 9 because I have 2 businesses to run and I can't get all crazy and party all night so I always cab it there and cab it home because I live close and want to be home by midnight. So with that being said let me tell you of my experience.  I get there, order a vodka tonic and a glass of water.  It has become the norm for me to get a glass of water with any alcoholic beverage to stave off a hangover and keep myself hydrated if I am going to be dancing, which I was doing quite a bit of.  An hour or so later I order my second drink, which the bartender says it was on him.  We had been having great conversations and I thought it was sweet so I of course tipped him well.  I ran into so many friends it was amazing and I was overjoyed.  I bought a Stella for one of my friends and another  glass of water for me since I wasn't done with my second drink.  Ran into another friend so I got us Fireball shots.  So at this point over 3 hours I has 2 vodka tonics and 1 shot plus tons of water. As I was standing at the bar for the last time 2 very drunk girls, who I didn't know, were being super obnoxious, grabbing my ass and all sorts of inappropriate behavior.  As I tried to be nice and get them to stop I tried to talk them out of getting more drinks and just getting water, which they did. Now here is where I have a huge issue, I ordered another drink for myself and was DENIED!!  When I asked why the answer was I had orders 5 drinks already so far.  This isn't a lie, I did, but out of those 5, over the span of 3 hours I had 2 vodka tonics, 1 shot and 3 glasses of water.  The other 2 that I paid for were for friends.   When I explained this to the only bartender that had been serving me all night and the bouncer who I hadn't even seen before they were so dismissive it was not only infuriating but embarrassing, I even told them I wasn't driving if that was there concern and the best I got was a nope sorry and some stupid hand wave.  I went to my group of friends to say goodbye and let them know what happened.  They were all so pissed and even offered to undercover get me another drink.  But you know what, it didn't matter,  getting the drink wasn't important.  Being treated like a piece of shit was. So I left, went across the street to another bar who not only gladly served me but kept their kitchen open a little longer so I could get some food to take home. I don't know if I will ever come back.  If I do it will be for the Blunt Club night only.  And I know sure as shit I won't be my charming self and give my business to only one bartender.  I will make sure I am all stealthy and go to the two different bars if I decide to consume more that 3 measly drinks over 3 hours.  So Valley Bar I know you are the new cool kid on the block right now but I have lived here for 27 years and know a lot of people.  I will be sure to let them know how much you sucked for me last night.
