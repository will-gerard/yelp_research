After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.  With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.  The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce.   Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.  The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

Call me a booksnake!  For my first review as a new Arizona resident, The Burton Barr Central Library came first to my mind. I made it a priority to check out the Phoenix Public Library system since I knew I would be spending lots of time here. I've been to many public libraries around the nation and I must admit the City of Phoenix has a very comprehensive and sophisticated system.  When you enter the Burton Barr Central Library, you'll notice the modern glass feel, the water feature in the lobby and the five floors of references and information. Each floor has a dedicated section but my fiancé Daniel L. and I always gravitate to the fifth floor because they have panoramic views of the city and it's typically quiet compared to the other busier floors. The window panels move with the sunlight and doesn't impede on your reading. They have rows of desk (each include power strips) as well as individual desks.   Do take advantage of the DVD rentals (3 weeks for free!) and the self checkout which will get you in and out of there.  The bathrooms also have this contemporary steel feel to it. In general, the library is clean and allows covered drinks.  The Wi-Fi is consistent and fast which scores huge points with us!  Hours of operation:  Monday 9AM-5PM Tuesday 9AM-9PM Wednesday 9AM-9PM Thursday 9AM-9PM Friday  9AM-5PM Saturday 9AM-PM Sunday  1PM-5PM  There is free parking and the Valley Metro conveniently stops in front.   Thank you Phoenix for your services!

While in Las Vegas, you walk up to the craps table and you got the pass and the don't pass line. Well for me, Earl of Sandwich was definitely a "pass".   I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional "bite". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading.   It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day.   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!

How can I not like this place? It has my name written all over it!  My hubby took me here on a Saturday night because he wanted to get my take on this popular gourmet taco shop. We stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead décor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.  The menu is divided into five sections:  Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet Taquetzin Street Tacos Gourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl  Gourmet Corn - Quesadillas Lonches  I ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or beans inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. Daniel's burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!  All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.  Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!  Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas.   I hope to return with Daniel to try the mole street tacos and say I ate at "Santisima"!

Have you actually seen a pig in a fur coat?!? You won't see one here but at least you can enjoy all the eccentric items on their menu!  Daniel L. took me out on a date night here for a 5PM reservation and surprisingly there were no other guests until we finished our meal.  We decided on three dishes:  Rabbit Rillette - $10 - rabbit meat, solidified oil and on the side sliced toast with pistachio and cherries. Sorry Bugs Bunny but this jarred dish was delicious! The meat is bottled with the rabbit meat topped with a thick gloss of oil. Take the toast and spread the meaty mixture on the bread and then top it off with the pistachio and cherry marmalade. If I were to order this again, I would scoop out the stiff oil and spread the meat directly to the toast. Great choice.  Lamb Carpaccio - $14 - corn shoots (made it extra sweet), egg yolk, salsa verde and thinly sliced lamb. We enjoyed this dish but there were only 3 slices of lamb and wasn't enough to justify the $14 price.  Veal Neck - $21 miso, carrot, turnip, ramps, radish. This dish was the loser of the night. We didn't enjoy it because it lacked flavor and ended up wasting it.  They have regular seating and a community table in the middle of the restaurant. If you come here, make sure you come early and get the attentive service we received. The server gave us recommendations and explained each dish spot on.  Even though we didn't have any pig during this meal, this place deserves a visit because of their variety, presentation and ambiance.

Snooze you lose?? Not here!  My Daniel L. brought me here after I landed from the airport on a red eye flight. We were both famished and ready for some breakfast goodies.  Thank goodness I trust him because he ordered the best two items on the menu: Chilaquelles Benny ($11.50) and short stack of sweet potato pancakes ($3.50). This was the first time I ate Chilaquelles Benedict. Heard of it? It's a stacked dish with tortillas, melted cheese and seasoned beef. The taste immediately woke up my taste buds! The circular hash browns were perfectly crispy and the poached egg was cooked with the yolk oozing out.  If you want to sample the sweet potato pancake ($3.50), order a short stack (one flapjack) because there is probably no way you can finish a full order. Dusted with powdered sugar, it was slightly over dressed by caramel syrup and could have survived with it's own flavor.   We arrived at 10AM and it was still jumping. Be prepared to wait and drool over everyone's order. Our service was pleasant and prompt.  After we were stuffed, we were ready to snooze!

All Aboard! Next stop Donutsville!  On a quiet Sunday afternoon, Daniel L. and I went on a donut date and found Donutsville filled with a sweet surprise all the way to the last bite.  We've been on a donut craze and wanted to explore their menu which had classic and non-traditional favorites. From donuts to cronuts and an extensive drink selection, we were impressed and somewhat overwhelmed with the selection. The staff was very patient while we made our difficult decision because they had over 32 donuts to choose from considering she mentioned they were almost sold out!   The date consisted of:   Glazed red velvet cake donut - I'm not a huge red velvet fan but this donut made me see the light! What made me crave more bites of this donut was the crunch of the cake donut and the light amount of sugary glaze. The chocolate had just the right amount of flavor. They also have the same donut with coconut shaving if you feel like a nut.  Blueberry cake donut - This is definitely my go-to donut since I had my first one in SoCal.  This one did not disappoint. Another highlight to was the lack of glaze which made the blueberry become the highlight. They offer it glazed for those craving the extra sugar.  Maple bar - My childhood favorite and this was unique compared to the usual maple long johns. The maple flavor stood out with a light glaze covered top of the bar compared to a thick, hard, brownish coating of artificial sugar with a hint of maple on it.  Cherry glazed and filled yeast donut - What a surprise! Better than a jelly filled, you get a double dose of the cherry glaze on top with a generous dollop of cherry filling with real cherries in the center. The yeast donut was so light and airy and each bite was more addicting after the other.   The cost of the donuts were from $.89 (raised or cake), $1.25 (specialty & filled), $1.59 (fancy), $.25/each $2.50/dozen (donut holes) or 1 dozen mix $8.90 (extra for filled & fancy). They accept cash or credit card.   Many customers ordered from their drink menu with a huge selection of coffee and smoothies drinks.   What made this a five star date was the interior with ample seating, free wi-fi, water and friendly service. For those you who are in a hurry, they have a drive-thru. Open 7 days a week, they work hard from 5AM-8PM Monday-Saturday and 5AM-6PM on Sundays.   Bring your sweetie to Donutsville and share a donut or two!

Tea & Toast? Please don't forget the coffee because it's one of the tastiest you'll find in downtown Phoenix!  Don't be fooled by the name since they serve many varieties of coffee for you Joe Lovers. From Americanos to Cappuccinos, they can create any drink without the "oh man it's one of those orders" kind of attitude. The coffee beans are locally roasted from Espressions which has a nice smooth finish.  I always gravitate to the hot Latte (small $3.50; large $4.50), almond milk with the rose syrup. The large comes with three shots which will keep you smiling all day long! Be sure to ask for latte art because it's only done by request. Another reason to smile!  My husband usually orders the green tea Americano (small $3.50; large $4.50). He enjoyed this as much I loved my latte.  For this tea, the manager apparently makes a blend and uses the same process of brewing a coffee. If you love tea, they can make it as a mocha, latte or a macchiato. With finesse and patience, this tea is a perfect way to relax away.  The pastries keep on hounding me but I resist because my drink is already sweet. They sell goodies from A Bakeshop and Simply from Scratch. Also intriguing is the food menu. They offer a breakfast menu (served M-F until 10AM and S-S till noon) with a good variety of dishes. The "toast" menu is available all day long and is served open faced style. One of these days I hope to try it!  For those who are lactose challenged, this place offers moo substitute of coconut, soy or almond for free, gratis, de nada!   If you need another drink for the road, majority of the drinks can be refilled for half price!   This cafe shares it's location inside the DeSoto Grand Market on the corner of Roosevelt and Central Avenue. With tons of inside and outdoor sitting, free parking and Wi-Fi, this place deserves a thumbs up.
