This comic book store rocks.  The place is straight up wall to wall comics everywhere you look.  The store is well organized and put together very well.  The back issues selection is huge.  The current issues selection is huge.  Overall a solid comic book store.   The staff is also down to earth.  Not like some places where they can be kind of snobbish.  At the time, a mom was in the store buying comics for  her kid and they were totally helping her out.  I appreciate service like that.   Support your local book store especially the good ones.  In the Phoenix area, this comic book store is a must.

Coyote Lakes is a beautiful looking course. Lakes, beautiful plants, well manicured fairways and greens, interesting wildlife (jackrabbits, prairie dogs to name a few) and challenging holes are what you will find here. There is a par 5 hole. I am thinking hole number 6 that has a raised green that has a rock wall front. My favorite hole on the course.  I had a good time but it was slow go. There was just too many groups ahead of us that played slow. The combination of poor etiquette, bad golf and too many groups scheduled too close together will do that. We also saw a few incidents with the neighbors who live near the golf course with other golfers. I saw one neighbor man yell in anger after a errant golfball hit his house from another golfing group. I guess it was the last straw because the neighbor just went off. I guess living near a golf course is a bad idea like living near an active volcano. You are asking for it. Overall, again a beautiful course plus everything I said before. The fee to play was fair. $55 for 18 and a cart. Would like to play here again. You should too but just keep it in play and don't hit any houses. The locals are restless.

After driving from San Diego, California to Phoenix, Arizona.  I went here needing an overdue oil change and to get my tires checked.  The owners were a nice couple who moved to Arizona from Rhode Island.  The husband does all the work on the cars and his wife takes care of the customers in front.  A very cool down to earth couple.  They are great.   I noticed that the wife also sells Avon products.  She had a little room displaying her items for sale.  When I was there women were coming in for their Avon needs.  I thought it was cool.  Didn't seem to interrupt the car repair part of the business at all. After my car was done.  I was happy with the service.  The place was fast, friendly and my bill was reasonably priced.  I would definitely trust my car with them again.  If your looking for a honest garage to take your car.  This is your place.

Driving to Peoria, Arizona to join some friends and watch some Padres spring training baseball.  We drove through a little town named Gila Bend.  Gila Bend can best be described as one of the towns where you fill your gas tank and grab a bite to eat.  It's not actually a destination where people plan to go but a place that is on the path to where you are really going. In Gila Bend, they have a few motels and a MickeyD's.  The bright spot of the whole place is a Dairy Queen right on the main road.  Driving to Arizona we needed to find a place we could go to the bathroom, a place where we could have our dogs go to the bathroom and a place where we could get something to eat on the road.  Dairy Queen was the answer. This particular Dairy Queen had public restrooms on the outside.  I was very surprised that the restrooms weren't locked like most places.  I even went inside to ask for a "key".  The employees inside nicely said that there was no key.  To top that off, the men's restroom was clean- woo hoo!  I don't have to tell you how restrooms like these usaully are.  So it was a big relief.  There was also plenty of dirt parking lot for my dogs to do there thing.  After that we went through the drive through.  I ordered a oreo cookie blizzard that was the bomb.  My wife ordered a ice cream sandwich, a corn dog and fries with a coke.  My wife gave me some of her fries and they were so good.  I laughed because my wife started with the ice cream sandwich first. We liked it so much that on the way home a few days later.  We went to Dairy Queen again.  This time I ordered a double cheese burger, onion rings and a coke.  My wife ordered the same thing she ordered last time.  Again she ate the ice cream sandwich first, lol. I have to say that the double cheese burger was the best I have eaten in a long while and the onion rings were especially good.  Didn't expect the food to be this good but it was.  If you are in Gila Bend, pass on MickeyD's and get some Dairy Queen. Funny side note, the service is really good.  The girls that work there are very nice.  The first trip, I wanted to tip the drive thru girl but I didn't have any cash on hand so I tipped her with a hand full of change.  On the way back, the same girl was at the drive thru.  I asked if she remembered me.  At first she said "no" but when I mentioned the change she remembered and laughed.  I ended tipping her three dollars.   The prices are cheap.  The food is awesome.  The service is good.  I don't usually sing the praises of fast food joints but this place is different.  If you are driving through Gila Bend, Dairy Queen is the answer.

Nooooo!!! My wife and I have been coming here for 3 years in a row to get the bomb milkshakes and ice cream sandwiches. Super clean bathrooms and an area to walk our dogs. Year four and now they are no more.  R.I.P Dairy Queen in Gila Bend. You guys were a bright spot driving to Peoria.

Went here on my last visit to Vegas.  My buddy is a big time Harley fan so we had to come here for lunch.  Glad we did because we had a great lunch.  First off the whole place is decked out of course in Harley bikes and anything Harley related.  There is also Harley bikes on a conveyor belt that go around the whole restaurant.  They almost seem to be floating as they go around.  The one thing that you have to keep in mind is that depending where you are sitting they could be going over your head from time to time.  At first we were a little concerned.  You could hear some creaking on the conveyor belt chains.  No worries though we didn't get a Harley caving into our heads. Next the food and drinks are awesome.  There is no such thing as small portions here.  Everything is big even the drinks.  As for the prices.  They are very reasonable. The food portions are not just big but what I ordered was delicious.  I had buffalo shrimp.  Never had it before but I will order it again and again.  They were great.  The nachos were covered with chili.  I have never been a big chili fan but this chili was different.  The chili had shredded beef on top.  Amazing.   The Harley Davidson Cafe has made a believer out of me.  Definitely a food stop the next time I am in town.  The place is great.

Stayed in Vegas for a few days and brought my clubs.  I was looking for a driving range somewhere near the strip to hit some golf balls in the morning.  So the night before, I asked the concierge at the New York New York hotel if he knew of any driving ranges in the area.  I wanted to find a 24 hours driving range but he couldn't find any close by.  He did however recommend the Callaway Golf Center on Las Vegas Blvd.  If you are on the main strip.  It's on the left side of Las Vegas Blvd.; south of the airport.  Super easy to find.   Well when I got there.  I was pleased.  The place looked pretty nice.  The driving range has a upper level and lower level.  I ended up hitting on the upper level.  It was awesome.  To top that off, a small bucket of range balls is only $4.00.  That was the cheapest entertainment I have ever spent in Vegas.  Ended up going there again the next day.  It really is a nice place to get your golf on. They also have a 9 hole course as well as a pro shop.  Unfortunately, I was there too early and the pro shop wasn't open yet.  I guess that's a good thing because I am in the market for some new clubs.  The Diablo Elites are calling my name. On top of that, they have a bar near the pro shop.  Big screens can be seen throughout.  Looks like a cool place to hang out and watch a game.  Next time I am in Vegas.  I am going to play the course and maybe have a cocktail or two after.

Just got back from Vegas for the Veteran's Day weekend.  Played the nine hole course this morning.  Was supposed to play with a couple buds but they couldn't get up in time because of the partying they did the night before.  No worries.  I did the course solo and had an awesome time.  The course is short and can be played fast.  So if your pressed for time.  You can still get your golf in for the day.   For $29, you get to play as many times as you want all day; that included a golf cart and a bucket of 90 golf balls for the driving range.  In my opinion.  A great bargain.   All the holes on the course are par 3's.  The course definitely challenges your short game.  Many of the holes have front side bunkers with a couple also having some water hazards.  So it was very important to know the distance you hit your clubs because coming short meant hitting out of the sand most of the time. The two level driving range was cool to hit golf balls off especially when the planes from the nearby Las Vegas airport flew overhead.  They also have a practice putting green and a bunker to practice hitting out of the sand.  They also have a top notch golf shop and instructors to help you work on your game.  I love this place.

Just came back from a Vegas trip.  Had the comic bug while I was there so I looked through the yellow pages in my hotel room.  Inside I found Cosmic Comics on East Tropicana.  I decided to go there and take a look.  We stayed near the main strip so getting there was a little trip in the car.  At first, I drove past it because it wasn't easy to spot.  It was in the same location as a limo rental place, a movie theater and I think an AAA.  There was a few bums around.  I saw one sleeping on a ledge and another asked my wife for some change.  Very interesting area but it shouldn't discourage you from going there.   Inside there are wall to wall comics.  One side of the store is all recent DC comics and on the other side is all Marvel.  In the back, they have other titles of other comic publishers.  In between they had shelves and shelves of back issues and graphic novels.  On the walls they displayed old issues of Marvel and DC comics.  Place is good sized and full of comic goodness.  I would of stayed longer but the wife was ready to move on with the rest of our vacation.  So I had to move fast.  Next time I am in town I hope to look around a little longer. The cool thing is that he still had a lot of recent issues that were long sold out in other places at cover price.  Batman and Robin #1 and Flash Rebirth #1 just to name a few.  The guy behind the counter looked like a old biker dude.  He gave me a comic book bag with a board for every comic I purchased.  There is a picture of him and his brother when they were kids dressed up as Batman and Robin.  Very cool picture and adds to the place.  Definitely visit this store.  It's a cool comic book shop.  Support your local comic book shops especially if they are good.  This is one of the good ones.j

My wife and I are big Bobby Flay fans.  We watch him on the Food Network all the time.  Who doesn't?  So walking around Ceasar's Palace we thought it would be cool to eat at the Mesa Grill.  It was around brunch time.  We were waiting to be seated but the waitress was on the phone.  So we waited.  After about two minutes she hangs up to tell us that they are closing to get ready for dinner.  So we could not be sitted but come another time.  We couldn't believe the rudeness of the girl.  I would of been totally cool if she just told us they were closed in the beginning instead of having us wait for her to get off the phone and her tone be like "her shit don't stink".  Stuck up hostesses are the worst.  Uggg! Being the gluttons of punishment we are, we decide to go again the next day again around lunch time.  I should know by now to never give places a second chance but oh well.  Again there is a "my shit don't stink" hostess.  Are they trained to act this way?  It is a hot day so I have been wearing a ballcap around town.  They ask me to take off my hat or sit at the bar.  I pause and decide just go with the flow.  I am on vacation.  No need to ruffle any feathers even though my feathers are a little ruffled.  So I take my ballcap off. We decide to order some drinks and appetizers.  The drinks and appetizers were real good.  Bobby definitely gets a star for each. We also ordered lunch.  My wife a salad and a burger for myself.  My wife's salad is okay.  My wife said that it was something she could make herself.  Nothing spectacular.  My burger was okay too.  Way too much bread for a bun.  Even the waiter said that a lot of people say the same thing.  The meat was also not that flavorful.  I have had better.  We should of stayed with drinks and appetizers. Overall experience was a let down.  The hostesses suck ass and need to do a better job.  Seriously, you want that to be the first impression of your business.  The drinks and appetizers were good.  The salad was okay.  The burger was okay.  Not what I expected from a restaurant with Bobby Flays name on it.  Defiinitely plenty room for improvement.

Okay, my wife and I were very leery about this hotel in the beginning.  It reminded us of a hotel in Laughlin.  Long story short.  We are never going back to Laughlin.  It was that bad.  Anyways we were very surprised how nice the Orleans ended up being.  For starters, the employees were very nice when we stayed there.  I really appreciate good service.   Secondly, the rooms were clean.  There was only one complaint though about the room.  They didn't have a good comforter on the bed but we ended up calling room service for more sheets.  So problem solved. The action was good when we stayed there.  The blackjack table wasn't too stingy.  The dealers were overall nice.  Only one female dealer didn't have much of a personality.  Saw her hours later.  Same thing.  She didn't even smile once.  Must of been having a bad day.  Oh well. They have a movie theater and a bowling alley in the hotel.  My wife and I passed because those are things we could of done back home.  But the highlight of the hotel I thought was the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory shop right before you get on the elevator to your room.  I couldn't resist getting something sweet before heading upstairs to our room. Overall it was a very nice stay at the Orleans.  For someone who usually stays at other places in Vegas on the strip.  I really enjoyed our stay here.  I would definitely consider staying here again.

Cibo itself is a oxymoron. Very cozy but large. Very romantic but busy. I will explain that later. This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies.  Getting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenix and not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of.  This night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need. Getting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street. Besides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another. What makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down. The crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here. And they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here. You will not be disappointed.

Went here a couple of weeks ago for brunch.  The line was long and moved very slow when we went.  When you do go to the front of the line you have to pay through an atm looking machine that you give money to instead of the other way around.  I found it kind of annoying.  I think that's why the line moved so slow.  It's everyone trying to figure out how to use the dang machine.  As soon as you pay though.  You get seated pretty quick and the feast begins.  At the time, they served mimosas for brunch.  Our server made sure the mimosas kept flowing.  He also made sure we had plenty of water with ice.  I made sure that we tipped him good before we left. As far as the buffet goes.  It was awesome.  My wife is not a big buffet person and she even loved it.  They pretty much have anything you could want at a buffet for brunch. I had the asian pork ribs, prime rib and shrimp cocktail.  So good.  After two plates I was full.  I was kind of bummed because I couldn't eat anymore.  I really had my heart set on some dessert but at that point I was done.  Definitely one of the better buffets in Las Vegas if you don't mind the long lines. One cool thing I found out was if you live in Las Vegas.  You eat for half price at the Carnival buffet.  So the locals get some love which is fine with me.

Dined here last time I was in Vegas with some friends.  Which was about a year ago.  We were rushed at the time because we were going to a show after.  So I was in a hurry and didn't get to really relax and enjoy my food.  Not a good way to enjoy any meal.  The result was I didn't have a good opinion or bad opinion to write about this place. So this past Memorial Day weekend, my wife and I went to RAO's a second time.  It was my wife's idea to eat dinner here again.  Unlike me.  She really enjoyed the last time we dined here.  She kept on talking about the sausage, cabbage and pasta dish that she had last time.  So she wanted to eat there and have the same dish she had before.  Calling the night before, my wife makes reservations for 8:30 PM. On the night of the restaurant.  I get lost going to Ceasar's and get lost finding the right valet and on top of that the traffic is bad.  I did remember why we were running late last time though.  It was because of the same thing.  As you can see.  I didn't learn my lesson.  To my credit we make it to dinner exactly at 8:30.  My wife even said that I was lucky.  I did leave early for dinner.  So I guess I did learn my lesson after all, lol. When we get there our table isn't exactly ready.  No problem.  They have a full stocked bar in the middle of the restaurant.  After driving around I was ready for a cocktail anyways. When we do get seated for dinner.  They put us in a booth in one of the dining areas.  Last time, we were seated outside of the restaurant.  On the walls, they have pictures of celebrities who have eaten at RAO's.  Something we didn't get to see eating at the outside tables.  Remember though, RAO's is located inside Ceasar's.  So outside is really inside still.  If that makes sense. All and all, the service was excellent.  The food was great.  My wife enjoyed her meal of sausage, cabbage and pasta.  I ended up having the house salad, the meatballs and the shrimp cocktail.  My wife and I also split the bruschetta as the appetizer.  Like I said before, the food is great.  The meatballs are what they are famous for and are the best meatballs I have ever had.  The shrimp cocktail was the real deal with big pieces of shrimp and a spicy hot cocktail sauce.  Loved it.  Bottom line is that I had a great romantic dinner with the wife.  Will definitely come back again on our next trip to Vegas.

I have stayed here twice thanks to a cool sister-in-law who lets us stay here on her dime. The timeshare resort itself is not very big but the rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  The best room I have ever stayed in Vegas compared to any room I have stayed in on the strip, this includes Ceasar's, Paris and Bellagio.  They have two pools, tennis courts, bar, pizza lounge, game room and  a mini gym that they have every building.  There is a total of 3 buildings which you can stay in. They also have shuttle bus service that takes you to the main strip.  It drops you off at Harrah's and runs every 25 to 30 minutes.  The shuttle is free with a pass that you get when you first check in.  Remember to tip the shuttle driver at drop off because it's the right thing to do. Back to the rooms, they have a dining room area where a whole family can enjoy meals.  A kitchen with all the appliances and utensils.  A in-room washer and dryer to do any laundry.  The bedrooms have a king size bed, TV and a joining bathroom with a jacuzzi tub for two.  There is also a living room area with another TV.  Like I said earlier the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  I would love to come and stay here again.  The resort is awesome.  I would even consider buying a timeshare if my sister in law stopped letting us stay here for free.

Coming to Arizona for Spring Training baseball.  I took a break and came to Hero Comics to satisfy my comic book craving.  Looked on Yelp and found out that this place was not too far from my hotel.  So driving less than two miles. I found the comic and game shop. Once inside, I saw a clean well organized store full of comic book goodness.  It didn't take long for me to find a few comics that I needed to purchase.  On top of that; the guy who was working in the store, Aaron, helped me pick some additional titles for a friend's 9 year old son.  My friend's kid didn't know too much about comics so I wanted to be the one to introduce him into this awesome world.  Aaron was a big help.  I appreciate the great service. Aaron also helped me out with a first time customer discount that they had on Yelp.  He didn't even ask for the coupon.  He just gave me the discount at the register. No questions asked.  Next time I come into town.  I will be here buying my books. Support your local comic book stores especially the good ones.  In the Phoenix area, Hero Comics is one of the good ones. Buy comics here.

Came here twice during our Memorial Day weekend in Vegas.  Our friends stayed at the New York New York and recommended this place for some drinks and Irish fare.  As far as the Irish feel this place definitely came through.  Dining inside we actually forgot we were in Vegas for a second and were in a old school pub in Ireland instead.  The Guinness beer on tap  is a winner.  Having a couple of pints, I also ordered ale battered and spicy sausages.  What's better than fried sausages?  Heart attack paradise anyone?  Kidding a side.  They were awesome. Second time we dined here.  I pretty much had the same thing.  I did have a different variation of Guinness though.  This time I had Guinness with a blond ale.  It was called a Yellow Jacket.  So good, I had another.  Besides a different variation of my drink choice.  We sat outside on the patio facing the main strip.  Not so much the Irish feel but still a good time onlooking Las Vegas Boulevard, the bright lights and people partying.  They also had a live band playing Irish folk music that night.  You could hear the music out on the street.  Something about Irish music that puts you in the mood to drink Guinness and get rowdy.  Definitely the next time we are in Vegas.  We are coming to the Nine Fine Irishmen again.  This place is a real Irish pub in the middle of the Vegas strip.

Okay. It was Saturday afternoon and just found out the Pacman/Marquez fight would only be showed at MGM properties.  We called around town.  New York New York, Aria, Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood all had the fight.  Unfortunately they were charging around 65 to 80 bucks cover just to watch; not including food, drinks and not guaranteeing a seat.  With three girls and four guys that would be rough. With our prospects not looking good.  We called on a friend to look it up on the internet.  Coming through, she tells us that the fight would be showed at Buffalo Wild Wings and there is no cover.  No cover!  Score.  We get directions and head over.  We are not locals of Vegas so going west of the strip is foreign to us.  We have only gone as far as the Orleans, Rio and In and Out Burger and that is it.  But we get there in one piece and before the fight starts and that's all that mattered. The crowd inside was mixed.  We went there to see Pacquiao win.  More than half of the patrons were going for the other guy.  Proof is when my son came in with a Filipino flag on his back and people were booing. The cool thing about this place was that they had all the sports on-  College Football (Oregon VS Stanford especially), UFC (dos Santos VS Velasquez) and the fight.  It was nice seeing everywhere you looked a big screen with sports.  That night was a good night for sports. We got a table that was perfectly placed by the bar.  We were also near a bathroom.  We had great service and the fight ended up being good but unsatisfying.  I want to see another rematch.  The wings were awesome and the drinks were good.  We had a great time.  This place is a winner.

Just stayed at the nicest room ever in Vegas.  Everything was top notch.  Our suite had a kitchen, two bathrooms (one small bathroom and one huge master bathroom-TV in mirror and jacuzzi tub), large comfortable king sized bed, big living room/dining area.  The room had it all.   Close to the main strip but not too close.  The hotel is about half a block from Las Vegas Blvd.  Take note.  The hotel does not have gaming.  The good thing about that is there wasn't any riff raff hanging around. The view from our room was cool.  We had a corner room on the 21st floor.  We could see the pool area, the main strip and seedier parts of Vegas (ie. strip clubs)  If I can manage it.  I will stay here every time.  Period.  Trump does it right.

The bar is your typical bar you would find in the middle of any casino floor.  The only difference is the bartenders are terrible.  They totally lacked any customer service skills of any kind.  It's like they really don't care about their jobs and were super bitter with life.  Two bartenders were on duty and another two were stocking the bar.  So it wasn't like they didn't have any help. It actually took us 10 minutes to get someone's attention.  When we did get the first bartender's attention.  He just looked at us but didn't do anything.  He just stood their watching TV.  Damn it.  I just got done running around trying to make a bet on a fight and basketball game.  I just want to chill and have a drink.   Even the guys stocking the bar weren't any help.  They just said "I am stocking the bar.  I am not a bartender."; I am like "Okay.  Can you get the bartender.  I would like a drink.".  How hard is that? When we finally do get a bartender.  She is a female and she is in a terrible mood.  I am thinking in my head.  What is going on?  She even insults my buddy for ordering a White Russian.  She says that my friend is ordering a girl's drink.  What?  The Big Lewbowski drinks them and he is the man. All and all.  There are many places you can go and pay for overpriced cocktails.  No need to come here.  My friend and I renamed the Breeze Bar to the "Tornado Bar".  You have been warned.

One the prettier stadiums in Spring Training. Home of the Rangers/Royals. Parking is free but if you drive an RV. They make you park way out in the boonies. So bring your walking shoes. Prices are high for food and drink. But we found a way to battle the high prices by buying a tent badge for $22 a person. After you already purchased a grass area ticket and are inside. The tent is located behind the right field wall. You can't miss it. It's a huge white tent. Once inside, you are in the shade with a nice breeze. On this day it was the hottest day of the week. So being in the shade made watching the game comfortable. They have round tables surrounded by chairs and counter seating facing the field to watch the game. Besides the shaded seating and a great view of the game. They feed you and give you a cocktail or soda included with your tent badge. At this game, it was catered by a local Mexican restaurant. Beans, rice, tortilla chips, beef taquitos, chicken enchiladas and carne asada tacos with all the toppings (salsa, guacamole, shredded cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro) and they also had for dessert- apple pie taquitos and chocolate taquitos. A very nice spread indeed. So while guys are buying $1.49 PBR tallboys for $9.50 at the ballpark. You are eating and drinking for $22. Remember though, only one drink with your badge. After that. You are paying for drinks like everyone else at the park but you do have your own tent bartender. So there is no line to get a drink. The tent staff is nice. The price is right. The food is good and filling. Great view of the game behind right field. If I come to a game again in this stadium. I am doing this again. Oh yeah. The Pads beat the Rangers 11-6. Go Padres!!

I wish I could say more good things about this place but I was very disappointed.  Okay, the girls are pretty and there is a lot of TV's.  That's it.  The food is overpriced and not very good.  Same for the drinks.  Afterwards, my friends and I wished I went somewhere else.  Definitely over rated.  Hooter's would of been a better idea, lol. The one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that I befriended that day.  He was a childhood friend of one of my buddies.  He ended up picking up the check which was over $200.  Thanks Dave.

One of the best looking stadiums at Spring Training in the Arizona Cactus League. Home of the Reds and Indians. One thing you will notice right away is the friendliest staff around. They are as warm as the Arizona sun and as sweet as a cherry Snowie. The people that work there are amazing.  A good ballpark is not without good eats. While I was there I did have a Snowie. Pretty much it's shaved ice Hawaiian style. The only difference is that you could flavor the ice yourself with an array of flavored syrups. You could go nuts adding syrup. It was a hit with the kids and the big kids like me. I did a cherry, pineapple, blue berry mix. So good in the Spring Arizona heat. I later partaked in a brat. The brat piping hot in a warm bun topped with the grilled onions and peppers were the perfect ballpark food. I eagerly ate the brat enjoying America's favorite past time. I also shopped their giftshop. My father-in-law is originally from Ohio and is a big Indians baseball fan. The store had wall to wall Indians and Reds merchandise. I ended up buying an Indians baseball hat for my son and shirt for my father-in-law. Believe it or not. I also bought Cleveland Indian ballpark mustard for myself. I am a condiment fiend. I couldn't pass it up. My only suggestion would be more shaded areas for the fans. A lot of the areas of the park are out in the open. Even some the workers stated that they wished there was more relief from the sun. I would have to agree. Have you ever sat in a plastic seat baking in the sun? Reminds me of that Christmas song.....Chestnuts roasting on a open fire....You get the message. Overall though, I had an amazingly good time. My Padres won that day. I was with my best girl and good friends. The sun was shining. I had a Snowie and a brat. Bought some souvenirs for the family. Life is good.

A nice hotel centrally located to everything I wanted to see and do. Check in was a breeze. The female at the counter was welcoming and efficient. She gave us the layout of the hotel so it made it easy to find our room after a long drive and kick up our feet. Everything in our room looked new. From our carpet to the bedding to the TV's to even the tiles in the bathroom. Nothing looked outdated. Nice, clean and modern are some of the adjectives I would use to describe our room. Oh yeah. Free Wifi. Big points for that. No password to punch in. Great. In the mornings, they served breakfast- scrambled eggs, sausage, home style potatoes, oatmeal, bagels, toast, fruit, coffee and juice (apple/orange). Which was a great perk in staying there. Completely helped keep the food bill down for a four day stay.  They also had complimentary alcoholic beverages for the adults in the evening between certain times. Three per adult. Unfortunately, we were never around to enjoy this. Maybe next time. They also had a gym and a pool. A very cool feature was the pool. They have a indoor and outdoor pool. The outdoor part being in closed by a gate so smaller kids couldn't just wander away. The surrounding area of the hotel is very big. Plenty of room to walk Fido. The  hotel even has a poop dog station. Where you can get poop bags and dispose of them in a special trash receptacle. A plus for anyone traveling with dogs. Drury Hotel on Pinnacle Peak Road is a wonderful hotel. I had a great stay here. The staff were nothing but friendly and professional. I would happily stay here again. They treat you right.

Went here during spring training after a baseball game.  We were a large group but they accommodated us no problem.  The place was very quite at the time.  Unfortunately we were loud and rowdy.  Thinking about it now.  They were very patient with us. The food was fresh and tasty.  I think we ordered everything on the menu between the nine of us who went.  Everything was awesome.  The owner even came at the end of our meal and did sake shots with us. And to think my friend told us not to eat sushi in Arizona.  I say "bah".  Yellowtail Sushi is a great place to eat sushi.  Take it from a guy who lives in San Diego and eats sushi at least once a month if not more.  This place is a must if your in the Glendale area.

Okay.  First off, I have been to a lot of places like Uptown Alley.  But there is only one Uptown Alley.  This place is crazy big with so much to do for young and old- bowling, arcade, billiards, lazer tag, a full bar and restaurant.  This place has it all.   It is kind of overwhelming.  The place is definitely not a place for some peace and quiet especially in the bowling alley and arcade areas.  Screaming kids is kind of the norm in these areas.  Don't be surprised to see a screaming adult once in a while as well.  The place is chaotic but fun. I did find the restaurant to be more peaceful.  I enjoyed a meal with my wife and some friends there.  I recommend the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs are meaty and flavorful and the sauce they use is on the spicy side.  Served in a oversized bowl.  The spaghetti is amazing.  The highlight of the whole place.  Writing this I am kind of sad because it's a state away and I won't be back in the area until next spring. The spaghetti alone gives me a reason to come back here.  We didn't get to do any bowling or any of the other stuff available to do there due to prior plans that night.  Just enough time to eat and go.  Next time I am bringing my bowling ball to Arizona.  You have to check this place out to believe it.

This year, made it back to Uptown Alley. The adults went to the bar to drink cocktails. The kids went to play laser tag. Later everybody, adults and kids, bowled side by side. The younger kids had bumper bowling. The older kids and adults played it straight up.  Been years since I bowled but I still represented with a 115 first game. Couldn't convert any darn spares. Second game. I rolled a 181. On the second game. In the tenth frame. The bowling alley switched to cosmic bowling. I was like "What the heck?" No lights except the blinking lights in the gutter areas. But no problem. Ten pin spare and a strike.  After we played some video games. One of the employees sold me a game card but then tried to overcharge me for the card. Kid thought I was a drunk parent or something. Tried to play it off as a joke but I wasn't buying it. Besides the game card incident. The place was more fun then I remember the last time we visited. Watch out for shady game card salesman and have a blast with family and friends.

Okay. Being in town yet again for Spring Training. For a third year in a row. Uptown Alley is a destination in Surprise after a Padres vs Ranger game. The first two times were fun memorable times. This time, memorable but not too fun. Let me retell my tale. We get to the place to find out that there was a two hour wait to bowl. Which isn't in itself the worst thing in the world. We can go into the restaurant/bar and have drinks and eat a good meal. Problem solved. Hmmm...no, not really. More like a problem starting to develop. With no hostess in sight. Not sure if she was on break, taking care of an customer issue or whatever else. We sat our nine person party ourselves; our party consisting of seven adults and two minors. Then the waiting game continued. Which was part our fault I have to admit. Flagging down a few employees. The employees said that they would get someone to serve us. This however became somewhat of a joke after a few more moments. Finally we get the restaurant/bar manager to serve us herself. Let me first to say. I also run a business that serves customers; so I know how trying it is to serve a lot of people at the same time. So our group and I cut her some slack. I wish the problems stopped there though. They didn't. I ordered a coke and water but didn't get a coke until my food came. I resorted to drinking my wife's soda in the meantime. My food didn't come for at least thirty minutes. Ten mango habanero hot wings, six small celery sticks plus a side of blue cheese. Thirty long minutes. But that isn't the kicker. My wings weren't deep fried in a fryer. I believe they were microwaved; and they came to the table COLD. Hot wings aren't hot wings if they are cold. Let me repeat. I waited thirty minutes for cold hot wings. Oxymoron!!! Sending them back. I got another ten wings ten minutes later. I am guessing the same wings I sent back plus one new one. This time they were warm. Not cold but not hot...warm (sigh). Being real hungry at this point. I tried my best to eat them. I couldn't get past five. They were bad. As of this review. I have been up since 4 am with the worst heartburn. Thanks to five mango habanero  WARM wings. After eating, we decided to just leave. No bowling. No video games. No anything else. We were done as a group. Let me end with this. The lady manager was a nice lady doing her best. The only reason I am giving any stars. I also didn't have to pay for the wings. She took it off the final bill.  This however needs to be a wake up call for management to really look at their operation to succeed in the future. It will take a lot for me to ever come back here. It was a disappointing experience for sure. If you continue down this path. If you piss too many people off. You won't have a business to run at all.

Where other places put there best stuff out of reach or behind glass. Dreadnought comics puts their eye candy out in the open. How the comics are displayed are unlike anything I have ever seen. Custom made by the owners themselves. Are these ingenious wooden walls on wheels that hold comics on both sides. No more flipping through comic book boxes here. You are actually moving walls.  Comics are organized by titles, artists and also by writers with the price stickers on the comic bag. These guys are hardcore comic book guys and the store is for hardcore collectors. Someone new to the hobby could be intimidated coming in here but don't be. The guys who run the place are nice and helpful. They will steer you in the right place.  I myself was looking for some Uncanny Xforce first run Remender issues. He actually had some behind the counter for me to buy. Gave me a great deal and I left happy.  Support your local comic book stores especially the good ones. In the state of Arizona, in Glendale is Dreadnought Comics. They are doing it their way and they are doing it right.
