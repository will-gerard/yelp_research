This is HANDS DOWN the place to go if your looking a superior barber shop in Scottsdale. Boris and crew have a natural talent when it comes to cutting hair and give nothing but exceptional service to all who enter. They know all their customers by name when they walk in the door making it a warming experience. The cuts are quick, with precision and exactly as ordered as all of the barbers know just what each person is looking for. Its only an added bonus that being in their is pure entertainment. The banter between all the barbers is hilarious and like sitting front row at a comedy show. I would definitely call ahead though and book a spot in the books as they are always busy due to high demand.   Without a doubt I  strongly recommend Shaving Grace Barber Shop to anyone I know personally, for I know they will not be disappointed.   Thank you Shaving Grace!!

Whiskey Row is THE place to go in old town scottsdale for country music and fun.  The service is exceptional and some of the best on the street. Couple of weeks ago I went into Whiskey row on a packed Friday night. Upon arriving the bouncers were very wecloming and checked id's at a very quick pace. Heading in doors the music volume was  set to the perfect pitch and the song choices are on point. The combinaton of  music and great lighting set up an awesome ambiance. Where I was most impressed was with the bartending service. On the occasion I had the opportunity to get drinks from Jordan, Lane and Mimi. Each one was perfectly crafted with a great ratio of alcohol to mixer as well I found them very reasonably priced.  As i sat at the bar the ladies checked back with me on how my drink quality was.  I personally was impressed by this as found this for as more drink orders came in they still knew to come back and check in on the customer.  I ended up staying there most of the night as a local band was playing and the energy inside the bar was extremely upbeat. With good music, excellent service and drinks I highly recommend whiskey row to anyone looking for a fantastic bar in old town scottsdale!

Couldn't be a better place for a date or dinner with a group of friends in old town scottsdale. It is nicely secluded giving you a very private feel. The patio is nicely decorated and the lighting and set up gives you a warm relaxing vibe.     The hostess was very friendly and welcomed us in with a great smile and open arms. One of the most impressive things about the restaurant is the quality of service you will receive. I have been to the Upton twice and in both occasions the servers gave superior service. They described each dish to a science and accommodated our taste buds to what we were looking for as well. We were also greeted personally by the owner Bran. He once again showed what superior service in a restaurant is by checking on us and making sure everything was up to par. He also gave a brief history of the facility making us feel at home and asked for any feedback we had for him.    The menu is on the smaller side and the dishes are tapas style all with a  creative spin making it a very unique concept. I have tried numerous items all in which were full of flavor and just the right portion size.   I personally love a bunch of dishes here. For appetizers the crispy confit duck wings fall right off the bone, and the broth in the mediterranean mussels give them a rich savory flavor. The angus bistro steak was cooked just right and the onions on the side give the two an amazing flavor. The seared wild salmon as well was extremely light and when dipped in lemon greek yogurt give a the salmon a very good spin.    Their drink menu is also of high caliper as their drinks are made with higher quality liquors. The Refresher is just that as the combination of cucumber, mint & lime give it a cooling sensation as you drink it.   I would highly recommend the Upton for anyone in old town scottsdale as it is nothing but excellence! Thank you Bran and the Upton Team!

Gave the place a try with my girlfriend and was very unimpressed with their service and food. Our waitress didn't even greet us for a full ten minutes and seemed pre occupied despite the restaurant being not too busy. We received our food late and my girl friends omelette was mixed up with someone elses  in the kitchen. I ordered the bacon waffle which wasn't anything special and for the price was not worth the value. The atmosphere is fun, however, and I could definitely see this being a sunday funday spot in the future. Even though our server wasnt that great, there was another server that was super helpful and sweet and was there to answer any questions we had ( great job girl with the short brown hair, tattoos, and glasses! You are awesome) this place definitely has some kinks to work out.
