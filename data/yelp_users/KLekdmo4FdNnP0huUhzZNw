I wish I had read these reviews before I bought from Wayfair. We had a similar experience. They're supposed to call before they come. Instead they delivered three large bookshelves which were already assembled. They came at 6:45 am and they blocked both of our cars. The call came at 7:10 am. When my husband said I thought you were going to call before, not after the delivery, the man said "have a nice day sir" and he hung up.

Great place. Gave it four instead of five stars because parking is always a problem. It is a great place to pick up a little nosh- pizza place next door as well. They have bakery items,. try the red velvet or the chocolate layer cake, sandwiches and more. They are open for breakfast , lunch and dinner. They have the absolute best english muffins-you must toast them twice and they get extra crunchy and talk about nooks and crannies! Oh baby! Love it. Service with a smile- and they mean it!

Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.

Top of the heap. Fantastic selection. Great prices and outstanding service.One stop for all of your needs whether you want to buy, have something repaired or cleaned or appraised. You can't go wrong. Much better and more personal than all of the chain stores. You will definitely get something unique.

I had not been to Wendy's in.....forever. Went last week and tried their 1/2 Baja salad. It was really good. Then went again a few days ago and had the same thing and a potatoe. I like that they have the soda machines where you can get any flavor. They even have diet caffeine free vanilla coke and diet caffeine free cherry coke. The yhave remodeled several locations and it really doesn't flow well. Everything is all backed up, no way to escape. How about removing that wall so we can go sit down. Call us up when it's ready. Or for the people that are waiting for their to go order, let them have a special seating area to wait. They do have several seating areas and then some areas with tables and chairs.

This practice is made up of several orthopedic doctors. I see Dr. Bruns. I have been going to him for years for various things- and am always happy with the outcome. Last year I had 2 total knee replacements (I call them January and June)  and now I am a new woman. I have no pain and can walk without any problems and no limp. Rehab was tough but not compared to living with the pain I was in. At least I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel. When I go to my appointments I have my questions on my notes app ready to ask and Dr. Bruns is always happy to answer all of the questions I ask him.  I must also compliment his assistant Julie. She is the best. She always explains everything you need to do or how to use anything you are given. I especially like that the practice has their emails on their websites so if I have a quick question, I can send her an email and not wait for an appointment. She will either get me the answer or let me know what to do.  Lastly, one of the other doctors in the practice had to have a knee replacement and he chose Dr. Bruns to do it. That says something.    There are also 2 offices. One is on the NE corner of 56th Street and Bell and the other is on 7th Street, north of Thunderbird on the west side of the street. I put the same review for that office as well.

I think this is named Cambridge Cleaners now. And it is $2.50 an item. But...having been a dry cleaners daughter I am not impressed. At all. Yes.....you get what you pay for but they are not able to get a simple salad dressing spot out of my husband's polo shirts. It has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains. It is not laundered- it is supposedly pre- spotted and then dry cleaned. 5 of the 7 had to be returned. I know it can come out. I have taken the very same shirts to another cleaners and voila- not a problem. SO why can't they get it out? I do not recommend and I won't go back.

Consistently comes to my rescue when I need a place to chill. I wish they were open for dinner. Today is what made me write the review. Went to one place, line was out the door. Went to another- same deal. Went to Einsteins and they were busy but not crazy busy. More like steady. Next time I'll go there first. Love the cranberry tasty turkey on a cranberry bagel. Love their seasonal food too!

I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!

I have been a member of the credit union since 1986. I have had basic accounts, car loans, and other loans and have gotten the best interest rates around. Never have had a problem. Service is great too. I am always asked when I go in (which is rare) if I need an extra check register. That is really nice because I usually do! Then they give me 2!

I was really surprised at how much good stuff they had at Christmas. I was looking for gigantic bows and I found them there and more! The gal that stocks the place really takes pride to make sure everything is where it should be and knows it like the back of her hand. You ask, she knew exactly where it "would' be if they still had it. I will go back.

My family has been going to PV Eyecare for many years. We have never had any issue with the staff or Dr. Rios who is the best! Appointments are flexible and prices are competetive. This is a no pressure place- unlike other places. You can buy your frames/contacts  there or they will give you your prescription and you can go elsewhere. I am not familiar with any of the other doctors that are there but if you need a great eye doctor- try Dr. Rios.

Haven't had a bad meal here yet. The salads are large. Large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day. My favorite is the Thai chicken. My husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich. They love the Parmesan pesto spread that have on it. I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises. My favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie. Darn. Shouldn't have told you. Now they will be out when I go!

This is not my type of store but I have gone in to purchase gifts. Those of you that rated it low, everyone deserves to have a place to shop. This serve the purpose for those people. Gotta give them props. They have excellent customer service and are willing to go out of their way to help you find something even at other stores.

My husband has been buying me flowers for many years and all from Flowerama- this location. He has forged a relationship with them and I am the one that benefits from that. He is loyal to them and I have enjoyed everything that he has brought from loose roses to full gorgeous arrangements. If you are looking for a shop- give them a try.

This is the closest grocery store to my home and I have been going here ever since they opened some 20 years ago, so this is the place I run in and out of often. I would give them 5 start but they are the absolute last to get anything new. And I am not thrilled that they don't have a larger organic produce area. No organic apples or peaches and they are the most important items to get organic. Hmmm. Anyway, they know me, I know them and they have my back except for that glitch.

House special chicken is a must. This is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good! Never have had to wait for a table. The banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too. I give it 5 stars because of the huge selection. Pei Wei and PF Changs are ok but they have a limited menu. And a LARGE wait!

I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a "petite" burger. It is smaller but has the same toppings you order on the regular. So for those of you that don't want to have a burger that is 1000 calories (yes they are and more with the endless fries) , try the petite.

I enjoy Chipotle and appreciate their consistent food. But fresh organic food does not mean low cal.  I normally get the barbacoa bowl, no rice, black beans, fresh salsa. But lately I have gotten the crispy tacos with lettuce on the bottom, steak, black beans, corn salsa and fresh salsa. I used to get a side of guacamole and chips but found out that that one bag of chips is like 1000 calories. Ouch. No more chips. I get the crunch from the taco shells. I like that we can order with the phone app and it is ready and waiting when we get there. Unfortunately those waiting in line do not like that we go right up to the front of the line to pick up the food.

This place is a disease. (in a good way) I like how they have items that are exclusive.One example is the limited edition ghirardelli squares. They used to have the dark chocolate cherry filled back around Valentine's Day and now they have the dark chocolate salted caramel squares. They are sooo good.   Only reason they don't get a 5 star rating is that the Starbucks that is inside never gets the order right. Never.

They do everything right. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the gorgeous panoramic view of the Red Rocks. My son had the Hillside burger and OMG couldn't finish it! What? That never happens. I had the petite filet and it was done perfectly. The unusual combination of green beans and butternut squash was really much better than I thought it would be. We were so stuffed we could not even look at the dessert menu. Plus I have to mention our server was excellent. He took very good care of us and so we took good care of him as well! ;-$

Ok I'm old. But this place is dark. So dark you can't read the menu. So I pull out my phone and use it as a light. We started off with the potstickers. They were a bit burnt so they started off on the wrong foot.  I ordered the filet salad. I enjoyed it. Couldn't see when I had eaten the good stuff so that was a negative. My husband had the green chile cheeseburger. He enjoyed it. We'll go back. During the day. They have windows so we'll be able to see!! We'd like to sit outside too. It looks nice to sit around the moat. ;-)

I feel deprived if I go and don't get the Thai chicken pizza but lately I have been brave and tried some new dishes. (then I get my pizza to take home) The Ginger salmon is excellent. The miso salad is also yummy. Tonight I'm having the Greek pizza. My husband always enjoys the meat cravers pizza and my son gets the other salmon dish they have. He loves the little lemon "bra" they put on the plate so you don't squeeze seeds all over your meal. Plus the sourdough bread is great too.

I have been attending this church for over a year. We started going because my son wanted to be able to get to know a girl that went to a different High School than he did and this was a chance for him to see her. Not the best reason but...it turned out that we LOVED this place. What I like most is that they are not constantly asking for money. They do not pass a plate for offering. They have slots at the back near all of the entrances and you can slide in whatever you want, whenever you want. No one watches to see that you put something in, and how much. I also love the music, I find myself humming the songs all through the week. Their video announcements are really clever, creative and humorous. We went to the meet the pastor dinner and were there with probably 30 other people. It was really nice to hear their philosphy and it was all very low key, not pushy. I appreciated that.

Just tried DeFalco's tonight after it was featured in the weekly YELP newsletter on cheesesteaks. I had the margherita pizza and a dinner salad and enjoyed it.  The italian dressing was meh. No spices- just oil and vinegar. I expected it to be a special homemade type of dressing since this is an italian deli.   Both my husband and son had the cheesesteak. They loved it. The roll was great and that is very important to the whole package. It was meaty as well. My husband liked the fact that the cheese was mixed and melted into the steak. Not on the bottom of the roll or laying on top. My son didn't like the fact that they didn't have WIZ but he is a teenager and  well...if you have a teenager you know where I'm coming from.   Even though we liked it, we like Philadelphia Sandwich Company better and it will be hard to go right by it to go to DeFalco's.   Another quick thing to mention. The guy taking our orders was not rude but his attitude was "I'm doing you a favor by standing here taking your order". So....I don't know if he was hung over or having a bad day but it was our first impression.

And I have experienced better Like at the Ritz or the Phoenician. There you do get what you pay for. Here it was ok. But just ok.  We had the buy one get one free deal so for $25 it was worth it but I would definitely not pay $50 for what we got.

I have heard about and read about this place for many years but never got to try it. My brother came into town and his boss said for him to try it out. So we went downtown and because of the reviews we purposefully went early. We got there around 4:45. Just in time for the Zombie walk. Lucky us. So we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We went next door to the bar and each had a glass of wine and the antipasti and crostini. $60 later..    We get a table. We each got a pizza and I got the farmers market salad to share. It was priced according to the items they put into it. It was $9. It had lettuce, and red onion and blue cheese which we got on the side. Really. It was not large. It had nothing else on it. To me that's not a salad. I thought being a farmers market salad there would be other veggies on it but I guess the market was closed.  The pizza was unremarkable. It wasn't even very warm. I like cold pizza too but this didn't make it. And It was worse the next day.    I love trying new places. I love pizza and salad. I just can't find a thing to make me go back to this place.  Not even if someone else was paying.

My friend and I have a list of places we want to try and this was on it. We went on a Saturday and had no problem being seated. Our server was great. He helped us with recommendations since it was our first time there. We started off with the Snoqualmie Riesling and it was delish. We then split a salad and a sandwich. The salad was roasted beet and the sandwich was the kobe burger and fries. Both were good and cooked to our specs. I would go again and try some other things on the menu.

I am addicted to this place. I take everyone I know there. Friends that I have taken there are now going and taking their friends and I love that!  The best part is the service- no the food- no the service- AHHH! You get the point. I love the manager Chris, the chef Bruce, and the pastry chef Jeannie. I have been there so many times that I wish I could buy stock in the place!  They treat me like a queen and I am no one. So that must mean they treat everyone like that. That's the way to do business.  All I can say is- GO! I have been there almost 4 dozen times and I feel like I should set up a cot.   This is also the PERFECT place to take people visiting from out of town because they will never have anything like it at home.If the weather is cooerating sit out on the patio. It is beautiful.    I love the DelMar salad, the Brussel Sprout salad, the french dip, and their seasoned fries are awesome! My son loves the ahi tuna burger and the red velvet cake. Our newest favorite is the short ribs. OMG. The short ribs. With the egg.  MMmmmMMmmm.   Try the key lime pie.  It was awesome. I  don't usually like pies like lemon meringue and key lime but my friend got it and I took a bite and then wanted one of my own!!! Irecently tried their sangria too. It was DEEEELISH! Just give me a side of fruit please! ;-)  And I must mention the chocolate chip cookie plate on your way out the door. They are to die for. (Btw- the old recipe is better) The right combination of sweet and salty. You must try them to understand. Then you will PLOT how to take more than one, but still be polite, and not look like a slug for taking an entire stack of them. NOT kidding!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Had the buttermilk fried chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus and it is to die for. Comfort food for sure. Not too crazy about their brunch menu because you must order off of that and not the regular menu. Their guacamole and warm chips are also a yummy must! This is a great place to take out of town guests because there is nothing like it anywhere else.

I love me my pizza and salad. I could live on pizza and salad. This place has your basic pizza but they also go off the map too and have some creative combinations. It is pricey. And the parking is not great. Hence the 4 stars and not 5. The LGO grocery right next door is a great place too- see my review of that and Chelsea's Kitchen which is up the street. A MUST TRY!

Oh Oh OMG. I have lived here for 25 years and finally found my cheesesteak thrill. I am originally from Philly sooooo if it makes ME happy YOU will love it. First of all, Nicholas is THE MAN. He takes such good care of us when we go we feel related. I call to place an order and all I have to say is Hey Nicholas it's sweet peppers. (inside joke). And he knows who it is. Ask for sweet peppers next time you go. I took him a gallon ( because dats how we do it in Philly) and I am more than willing to share them with anyone that wants to try them. I am confident that some day they will actually be on the menu.  Now let's talk food. My favorites are the Italian hoagie with sweets and a cheesesteak (wit-out) with provolone. Yep.  I can taste it now. Dang I have to go right now and get some.   OK I'm back. My husbands favorite is the sausage parm with jalapenos. My sons favorite is the cheesesteak wiz wit-out. We also enjoy the fries and sweet potato fries extra crispy- well done- tortured hollow tubes- I wanna hear them SCREAMING!!!  And he does them the way we like them!  To top it off you MUST try the tastykakes. They get a ton at a time and freeze them. Our favorites are the butterscotch krimpets, the peanut butter kandykakes and the chocolate kandykakes.   I'm telling you, you will not be disappointed. If you are- SPEAK UP- and Nicholas will make it good. That's just the way he is. And for those of you that are complaining about the bread- they changed it. It is awesome. Go back and try it!

Great place to take company. A decent variety on the menu. And the food is good. Expect to pay for the area it is located in. The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they had more choices on their dessert menu. Plus we were not asked if we wanted dessert. The server brought the bill and we felt like it was time to get out. So we didn't order dessert and left. Their loss. Never assume. Always ask.

Have not had a bad experience here. Service is quick and friendly and the food is consistently outstanding. The only negative is the wait. But it is worth it. And I wish it were open for dinner!!

A friend of mine recommended this place and I love it!  For $3 you can sit in your car and have it washed. They also offer free vacuuming. What more could you possibly want?

I was really disappointed with my visit today. I dropped in to pick up a small something for my mom and dad for valentines day. I was hoping to get a small arrangement with honey dew, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, grapes you know the stuff you see on TV. All they had were chocolate dipped (not covered) strawberries and pineapples. So I chose a box of a dozen choc dipped strawberries which was $29. It was more than I wanted to spend since I had already gotten them something else. When she took the box out of the case I saw some of these heart shaped choc covered thingies. She said there was pineapple inside and each was $3.99. Ok good. So I changed my mind and got 2 of those. Gave her my debit card expecting to punch in my pin.  Then she asks for my address. I declined (thinking it was for a mailing list) and she said no I have to have it to make sure the credit card matches the address. I said no. She said she had to have it. I said I'm not going to give you my address for an $8 purchase. I'll be happy to show you my license to prove I haven't stolen the card. That was not acceptable to her. So I said that I would pay cash. Apparently they are not set up to do a debit. And there is no way to back out of a transaction. I was surprised that a national chain would not be set up to do this and that you had to give an address for a charge transaction. If I were on the phone OR having it delivered I could see this being necessary. But not standing in the store. I was actually ready to leave without making the purchase. So she had to totally shut down the computer to get out of that transaction. There was someone else on the other computer who was taking phone orders so I had to wait for her to finish to be rung out of that computer and would I wait. I didn't mind the wait. But I felt bad for the other people behind me waiting. I paid and left. While I was waiting to pay another gal asked the 2 people waiting if they wanted a choc dipped strawberry. I thought to myself how nice that was and it would have gone a long way toward making my visit more positive. I however, who had been waiting the longest, was not offered a strawberry. Got it. Next time I need something I'll go to Safeway, or the florist, or Frys, or Albertsons, or Target, or Bevmo...you get the picture.

New info- it's been 2 years since my original review and since then they have changed owners. I never had any issue with the other owners but the new owners have spruced up the place. There are brand new pedicure chairs. They are quieter and really nice. WOW. I know they were expensive. They also massage you like the old ones did.   I have been going here for pedicures for several years. I don't have regular person but no matter who does the pedi I get a very consistent result. I usually never have to wait. I have taken friends as well and never been disappointed. Reasonable prices as well.

Wow what an experience. I went in for their free air pressure check. He told me I needed 4 new tires. Now I had just gotten theses tires from them about a year and a half ago so I thought it must be because I'm a girl and he's trying to snow me. So I happened to be getting my oil changed by my mechanic whom I've been using for many years and he even said I needed tires.  So it just so happens that I get an email for a Black Friday deal saying if I buy 4 tires online and make an appointment to have them installed I get $50 bucks off. Ok. That works. So I buy the tires and make the appt for the next day. I go. I get them put on. The guy says wow you really didn't get a lot of mileage on these. We will submit them to Yokohama and they'll prorate it for you. Since it was Saturday they couldn't do it that day. So my total was $492. That's with the $50 discount for 4 Michelins. So Monday comes and I get a message saying the guy I had wasn't working that day and he'd take care of it Tuesday. Ok I thought it was nice that they took the time to let me know. So I stop in on Tuesday and my guy calls the company right there. He refunds my $492 and the new charge was $173. They were 80k mile tires that only lasted 17k so I got most of it back. Then I said but what about the Black Friday discount?  He said well you're already getting them for $173. I felt intimidated so I accepted it and left. The more I thought about it the more annoyed I got. After all, I did what I was supposed to do for that deal. He said they would have to eat the amount I was refunded because the tires didn't get saved. Someone disposed of them.  Not my fault either. So I went back. A new guy helped me. I explained. He pulled up the info. He got my guy. He said does this amount reflect the $50 off?  My guy hesitates. Looks at me. I say nothing. He knows. I know. He says well we're eating the prorated amount because the tires were disposed of. New guy says that doesn't matter. Does it reflect the $50?  My guy says- I guess not. New guy gives me the refund. 4 new Michelin tires for $123. ;-) Just beware people.

I saw Jim's lunch (grilled sourdough with pesto, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil) (see picture  I posted) and my mouth was watering. I wanted to try that baby so I called to see if I could talk him into making me one! I must have caught him in a good mood because he made me one. I am telling you it was absolutely awesome! Took it home with the rest of my order...My car now smells like pesto- (Hmmm- new air freshener idea). Everyone is mad because I would not share it! The best part was using the bread to sop up the oil and vinegar at the end. YUM! Jim thank you so much for allowing me to try it- please put it on the menu!  My husband had the smoked chicken pizza and my son had the turkey BLT. They both loved it. I also got a carrot cake cookie and giant peanut butter cookie and they loved them too. If you have not tried this place- go give them a try. They will mix and mingle their ingredients to make you happy.. ALL fresh ALL the time!

Tonight was our first time trying Flo's. We arrived during happy hour so appetizers were half price and we ordered the crab puffs. I had the Kung "Pow" chicken and my husband had the orange chicken. We also had the chocolate won tons for dessert. I can't complain about the food. It was good. It was a large portion for the price and it was hot food. It was fine but unremakable. Didn't blow me away. What DID blow me away was the service. It was outstanding. Our bus boy was so great I gave him a tip. We were well taken care of and I would go back.

We chose this hotel because it was close to where my brother was getting married. We stayed for 2 nights. The curtain would not close completely so there was a strip of sunlight that woke us up each morning. And housekeeping missed our room. No clean towels, beds were not made, trash was not emptied. They simply didn't do it. Disappointing because when we came back to the room later that night after the wedding with friends and relatives, we were surprised to see it had not been touched. Embarrassing.  The next day when we checked out we told the front desk and they barely squeaked out an apology. It's as if they didn't care. So, I guess we stay elsewhere next time. The only reason I gave it one star is because it had a nice deli, and ice cream place.

Yes this deserves a five star review. Everytime we have gone we have been pleased. They have- get this - HOT FOOD  I am sick of getting luke warm food at restaurants. We had the tenderloin medallions and even though I like it well done they were still moist and not dried out. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.

O.M.G Their cupcakes are really to die for. I wish they were NO CAL!!! They get 4 stars because $3.25 and up for one cupcake is stiff. But for a treat- why not. Most people will pay $3.25 or more for a cup of coffee- so there's your trade off.

I am critical of hotels and resorts because I expect them to do anything they can to make my stay a good experience. The Radisson did. I thought the room was great. Nice furniture, nice furnishings and accessories. You can make the room DARK because it has 2 separate sets of curtains- sheers and the black out ones.  The bathroom was a good size. Everything worked. The shower was great- good pressure and as warm as I wanted it to be. The A/C was also able to be controlled by me and I like that. Only negative was that the fridge wasn't really cold. I put water bottle in there and they did not get cold.  And they have sleep number beds. It was set at 75 and I couldn't get it to change. It was fine and I slept well.   I was there for a conference and we had meals provided. The dinner was great! A nice tomato and mozzarella cheese balls with a light dressing in a martini glass to start. Classy. A steak with potatoes and veggies and rolls. And then this giant cream puff for dessert. It was delish!!! Then breakfast was buffet style- eggs, potatoes, tons of fresh fruit, danishes and muffins, bacon and sausage and more I can't even remember. Then lunch was a wedge salad with bacon, tomato, red onion, blue cheese and a italian dressing as the starter. A southwest chicken breast on mashed potatoes and carrots and asparagus as the main lunch and then tiramisu for dessert. Really filling, large portions.  Scenery was gorgeous. To those that say this is in the middle of nowhere- you are right but just around the corner about 2 miles away you can find anything you want from a Starbucks to a Target.   They also have several restaurants and a buffet and a casino but I didn't choose to go visit them.  The grounds are gorgeous and you can see the Fountain Hills fountain from the property. They have a nice large split pool and a big hot tub also with lots of shade and seating. I am thinking of a nice getaway for my husband and I to this place soon. When the weather cools down it will be gorgeous to sit outside.

I went to this restaurant because I saw it on Triple D!! The place is small. Really small. Most of the seating is outside. I had the over easy and it was ok. There was just too much spinach. It overpowered the taste of the rest of it. I tried the house made protein bar and that was a little soft but good. My son had the wolfpack and loved it except that he had asked for extra crispy hash browns and they weren't.  Our biggest complaint was that the food was cold. In a place so small there really is no excuse unless it was just sitting there.....

Very very disappointed in the fact that they have discontinued several of their salad bar prepared salads. I loved their southwest lentil salad and the mediterranean orzo salad. The lentil salad is gone. And the orzo salad has changed. Not in a good way. SO that's what used to get me there and I would wander around and end up spending $100. SO now no reason pulling me in. They have lost my $$.

This place is growing on me. I have been to the Scottsdale Quarter (Arizona) and Las Vegas locations and had the same thing and it was consistently satisfying. I got the sweet potato and chicken risotto and salad. Yum! My company also enjoyed what they ordered. Service was terrific. It definitely adds to the meal.

I am addicted to the grilled chicken and fruit salad. It is low cal if you use the low cal dressing and very filling. The staff will go out of their way to get things right- and make your experience a positive one.  I buy the nugget trays too when I am having guests and it is always the first thing to be finished.

Stopped in after the Dbacks shellacked the Rockies last night (12-3) and celebrated with a toffee banofi. It was totally awesome. We had seen it featured on the Best Thing I Ever Ate and wanted to try it since it was in our state! My husband had scoops of salted caramel, peanut butter and vanilla. He enjoyed all of them. We'll be going back again and again...loved it and can't wait to try more things.

The only reason I'm giving four and not five stars is because it is pretty far from my house.   A friend of ours took my son and husband here and they raved about it. So they've been trying to get me to go. Well I finally went and it was worth raving about.  We started off with black and tans with Guinness of course.  Then we had the warm Potato chips and the cheesy potato balls of goodness as appetizers.   I had a salmon dish with the horseradish crust which melted in my mouth.   My son had the fish and chips and raved about it.   My husband had the bangers and mash and our friend had the lamb stew. All enjoyed their meals.   We also got the bread pudding and the chocolate dessert to share- sorry can't remember the name of the chocolate one.  Would definitely go back again- there was so much I wanted to try.

I have been going to this location because we have a group that meets here once a month. I am not really a fan of their food. I much prefer Wildflower's choices, And the attitude of people behind the counter has always been like- I'm doing you a favor by making this sandwich or salad or whatever.

The previous reviews about feeling like they were pushing you out of the place are accurate. Split a salad with my friend and the french dip came before we were halfway done with the salad. Not cool. Also french dip was not hot. I tried it right when it got there to check. Nothing to write home about. I much prefer Chelsie's Kitchens food, service, patio etc. Probably won't go back.

I wish we had a closer one to our home. We were at Tempe Marketplace and saw it and I had to go. They  have an awesome salad bar. Not many restauraunts even have them anymore. And I must say their croutons are DA BOMB!!! Our server Lisa was also wonderful.

I have been going to Scramble for 2 years- I can't believe I have not reviewed it yet!   I love the casual atmosphere of this place and I love the outside patio when the weather is cooperating.   The service is great and the food is even better. They are open for breakfast and lunch. The menu is varied- breakfast pizza's, salads, sandwiches, benedicts etc...  My husband loves the gringo burrito. My son loves the eggs benedict and I usually create my meal from the al la carte menu.   Try the cinnamon roll....you won't regret it!

This was our first time at LB. It wasn't crowded which is cool. We started off with the half LB lavosh. Then I had the coca cola ham sandwich which was very good. My husband had the atomic burger and he liked it a lot especially the horsey on it to spice it up. We both asked for well done extra crispy fries but they weren't. They were barely even hot. So bummer on that. Since the desserts are house made I tried the challah bread pudding and he tried the key lime pie which had crushed lemon cookies as the crust. Both were delicious! (see pictures that I posted) We can't wait till it cools down so we can enjoy the outside area.

We have gone to this place a few times. Always has great choice of flavors and is clean. I like that it has a water cooler there. One thing is that their wall poster has 3 sizes of cups but there are never any small cups there. Hmmm. It is 30 cents an ounce as opposed to the next place I am reviewing- yogurtology which charges 45 cents an ounce.

Yay!! Finally a yogurt place that has a kids cup and they let you use one if you're not a kid. Love the flavors. Love the toppings. The only negative is that they put new product on top of old product when the container is low. Not cool.

Saw a coupon in the entertainment book for this place and had never heard if it. Friends said they are as prolific as mcd's in wisconsin and that I had to try the cheeses curds. What? Curds? So I took my son one afternoon for lunch and now we are hooked. Great fresh burgers cooked when you order it. Plus the concrete mixer frozen custard is awesome. My favorite so far is the cherry cheesecake. They have several flavors all the time plus a flavor of the day. Plus an iPhone app which is great!

The only reason I didn't give five stars is because I must try more items on their menu. I really had a hard time deciding- breakfast...lunch.....I decided on breakfast. I had the fruit cup which was really good. Most places give you two maybe three fruits. They had watermelon, canteloupe, honeydew, pineapple, blueberries, stramberries and topped off with slices of banana. This was fresh- not sitting there in juice making everything taste the same. Yum. I also had the whole wheat pancakes with granola which my son finished because they were huge.   My son got the eggs benedict and home fries and loved it. Along with the rest of my pancakes. ;- )  My husband got the house omelet with home fries and English muffin. He enjoyed every bit.    Best part of the meal was our fantastic server Crystal. She was a hustler and would bring beverage refills before you hit the bottom. She was extremely attentive and took very good care if us.   We will definitely be going back and will ask for her.

Another place my friend and I have wanted to try. We enjoyed everything. We spilt the warm Italian grinder and thank God. It was huge. No way would I have been able to finish it all by myself. We also split the chopped vegetable salad. Every thing in it I love.  It was awesome. There are several other things I want to try. Like the warm potato chips and French onion dip. The shaved prime rib. And the 36 hour pork ribs. Bring it on.   The atmosphere is nice too. I can't wait until its cooler so I can sit on their terrific patio.

Four stars only because I haven't seen it all. Went last week to the music educators event. They are getting the school field trips going in a few days. Already scheduled my school to go.  They have a nice coffee shop and a cafe for lunch. Gift shop is great. New stuff coming in all the time. Staff was great and very helpful.   I am planning to go to many concerts they have coming up. Going to take my son to the international guitar night in February. Check out the extensive list of upcoming concerts online. Some are free just with admission and some you have to buy tickets to.  It is a massive place. Two floors. Very well laid out. You don't feel squished at all. It is definitely a place out of state visitors should go. And then go across the street for lunch or dinner. It's a once in a lifetime place and it's the only one in the world.

We were one of the lucky ones to get a postcard in the mail offering us two FREE nights. Well yes twist my arm I  think we will take you up on that offer! So we book it and go. It was not a grrrreat experience- room was not ready- several glitches in the whole experience. They had only been open for 3 months at that time. But then lo and behold. we get ANOTHER postcard. Two more free nights. OK. Why not! This time things were not so out of control. Room was ready, all went smoothly. From the balcony of our room on the 62nd floor it overlooked the Bellagio fountains and a night shot of Paris across the street. We went to try the Buffet but it was $34.95 each for Sunday morning. We knew we could not possibly eat $70 worth of food so we passed. Just little too rich for our blood. Shops were so so. Especially with the Caesars shops within walking distance. The parking garage is below ground, It is pretty cool. There are little lights above each space. If it is occupied, the light turns red. It it is available it is green. So when you look down the aisle you can see whether or not there are any open spaces. Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Genius.

I have lived in AZ for over 25 years and had heard this was a nice place to go. For our 27 Anniversary we decided to give it a try. We had planned to sit outside but the night we went it happened to be a very chilly night because of a recent system going through the state so we sat inside.   We had drinks- gin and tonics. I had the house gin and my husband had the tanqueray. Mine tasted very chemical-ly. Noticeably different than my husbands. So I got the El Chorro Bloody Mary after that and it was good.   Then we tried some appetizers- I got the grilled cheeses- very greasy. I didn't realize (nor do they tell you in the menu) that every piece has a different cheese inside. I am not a fan of blue cheese and of course that was the first one I ate. It was gross. And also the last one I ate.  My husband had the sausage plate and he enjoyed it.   For dinner I had the special- prime rib. I asked for the end cut hoping it would not be crawling rare. Nope. It was. It was a huge piece of meat and I took most of it home, cooked it a little more, and then sliced it and added it to a salad. The twice baked potato and veggies that came with my meal were cold. Nothing fries me more than paying $200 for a meal and it being cold. Sigh. My husband had the pork tenderloin . He liked it. It came with a pile of carrots and broccolini. Niether of which he ate, and some kind of orzo which was ok.   Then we tried dessert- he wanted to try the home churned ice cream. He liked it. I got the gooey caramel butter cake. It had some ice cream on top. It was ok.  I guess I was expecting to be blown away and wasn't. It was just ok. I probably would not go back and would not recommend anyone else go. For the price it just didn't wasn't over the top. Our server was ok. They couldn't manage to get the Dbacks on the big screen that was near us. Hmmm. Why? And something else kind of weirded me out. The hostess had a nice ruffley dress on- appropriate for this type of place yet she had flip flops on. Not nice ones, but kind of too casual ratty ones. That didn't impress me either.

Wow. I am not a huge burger eater, but I was very impressed with my meal. It was as if you went to your neighbors house for a cookout where they had a spread of fixings and you built your own burger of awesomeness. My burger was perfect. I got the angus burger on wheat with cheddar, onions, pickles, mayo, ketchup, tomato and lettuce. I also had the side of sweet potato fries which were also cooked to perfection. My husband and son also enjoyed their burgers as much as I did. We will be back.

Tried them during restaurant week. Loved the atmosphere. Very polished. Food was fine. Server was awesome. I enjoyed the lobster risotto- it was little salty for me. My husband had the short ribs and they were meh. Nothing to write home about but we have had better elsewhere. Glad I tried it but I would probably not go again and pay full prices.

Well, I am changing my review. Just went back this past weekend and asked for a small cup and he said only on Tuesday's. That stinks. Probably won't go back.   Great place. I have been to a few of these places and I like this one because it has a low per ounce price and a lot of non fat and low fat choices. Other places don't have that. I also like that they actually have a kids cup so you can get a smaller serving. You do have to ask for it.

My new favorite place that I never knew existed. I had been to the Scottsdale Quarter to lunch at Brio and True Foods but never knew this place was there. On the second floor. Right- who knew- second floor? It is part of the ipc theater. There is Tanzy the restaurant, Salt, the lounge and then the ipic theater where you can dine and recline while watching a movie and being served. Been to lunch several times and had the proscuitto wrapped asparagus salad which came with mixed greens, red and yellow tomatoes and strawberries drizzled with a balsamic dressing. It also had a set of crostini with a delicious cheese spread on them. I went today with a friend and was looking forward to having it again....and it was gone! WHAT?? So we split the cedar plank salmon with the israeli cous cous and the shrimp/crab cobb salad. All very good! Check out my pictures too.   Great relaxing decor overlooking the water fountains and palm tress swaying on one side and the mountains on the other.

I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.

CC where have you been all my life?? This is THE place to find that item you need to dress up your outfit. It is reasonable so you don't feel bad only using it once or only for one outfit. Whoever thought of this concept is a genius.

2012- I was hoping the handicapped issue would have improved this year but alas it is obviously not a priority. It was a fiasco. They wave us from one lot to another eventually we arrive at THE handicapped lot. But there were none left. Please note- it is an hour and a half before the game. Then they say you can park anywhere in that lot but that defeats the purpose. It is too much walking for my dad. So we go to the next lot over and the security gal says it is the players lot. Really? Why do the players need handicapped spaces in their lot? Hmmm???   So my dad slowly makes his way to the entrance of the stadium and there is his chariot- a terrifc Ex- NYC cop with a wheelchair. He was wonderful. Thank you Joseph- you made his night!  Then after the game Joseph came back and got him. He saved the night.   Now, will we keep going back- probably not. It's too much of a hassle and no one knows anything. No radio people around outside the venue. (see review from last year just below) Inside the stadium there are a lot of people around to help. Not outside though.   2011-Beautiful stadium. Beautiful location. Great experience. OK food- I loved the noodles place. Yum. We went to about 6 games and really enjoyed the night time games. Beautiful weather at that time of year too.   One negative. Handicapped parking where are you?? We took my dad to a game and had the plackard so he wouldn't have to walk as far and we went early on purpose. They kept waving us on and once they made us park we were incredibly far away. My dad schlepped in. Once we got in I asked a person what to do next time. He said we had to have to find a person out in the lot  with a radio. They would get a golf cart, that would take him to the stadium and then they would wheelchair him to the seats. So the next time we went we tried to do what they said but trying to find someone with a radio was a fiasco. On the way out we did get him wheelchaired to the lot, and then golf carted to the car. Please make this an easier more obvious process.

It was ok. I have experienced better places that have the same food. I felt pressured to get certain items, being that it was my first time. What's weird is that they have kebobs but no gyros. Probably would not go back especially with Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy right nearby.

Great  food. Small space inside with about 10 tables. Basic burger menu. They do everything well. The homemade potato chips, fries and sweet potato fries were great too not just the burgers. I hope they stick around!

Probably won't go back. The teen worker was not helpful. Is there a rule against them touching your cups. She would not touch it. She just kept bossing us around. Move that cup on, move that off etc...Did she not pass her food handlers test?  Also why is she not allowed to change channels on the TV. Really!  We couldn't believe it. Was she just lazy?  No one else was there. Or is she being given directions? Either way. The experience overshadowed the yogurt. That shouldn't happen.

We decided to ride the light rail from end to end for something to do. We were going to get off at Mill and grab a bite at Whichwich but they were closed. Their loss. Ended up going here and it was great.  It was busy and filled with ASU students and hikers of A mountain. I got the original chopped salad. See pic. It was outstanding. If you've read any of my reviews you know it takes a lot to impress me and they did. My husband had the loaded omelette and also enjoyed that. See pic. We will definitely go back.

I was looking forward to trying this location since it is close to home. First impression was not good. My family and I walk in and the floors are sticky. Gross me out. Then the server we had must have been on something she was so hyper and the things that came out of her mouth were ridiculous. Mind your own business and do not make small talk. PLEASE! Went through the line and didn't expect to see raw meat and fish in bins. That was not appetizing at all. I really don't want to see my meat before it is cooked. I chose scallops and if I go back I will to try a chicken dish. Veggies in bins were not fresh. Sauces were ok. Desserts were not appetizing. Bummed.

A friend recommeded this place. It's a new owner and he said the food was great. So we go. I ordered Papi's sloppy sandwich (which my friend had)  and well done fries. My husband ordered the nachos. They brought the sloppy fries by mistake but left them and went to make my order. When mine came we realized that the mistake was better then the sandwich. The bun they used on mine was gross. Very soggy. Meat was good and waffle fries were excellent. Nachos were ok.   I didn't give it 5 stars because it is crazy noisy. I know it's a sports bar but there were maybe a dozen people there and you had to yell to be heard. There is no carpeting or anything on the walls to absorb the sound.  Maybe wel'l get the food to go in the future.

Tried this for lunch one day with a girlfriend. Neither of us had been before. We split the heirloom beet salad and the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were excellent. Service was good and I would definitley go back. It was nice sitting outside and the only negative I have is that the slatted chairs were uncomfortable. I would like to go back just for dessert since the menu looked really good.

Tried this restaurant after church today and we will be going back. There is a large variety to choose from and I had many I wanted to try. Today I got a dish that was on the special menu- it was sort of an egg's benedict type meal. Very good. The side of potatoes was really good. I love that there were 4 or 5 different types of potatoes in it.   My husband got the jumbo wet burrito. It was jumbo. We were very happy with the food and the service. Alex our server was great and we will ask for him again.   Unfortunately there is no website. Why? The menu is identical to the Heart and Soul Cafe so why didn't they just call this the same and add the new address to their  website.

SInce my previous review we have returned many times. We went for dinner and had a fantastic meal. The reason there is no web site is because the chef changes the menu frequently. I get it.  I also finally tried the lunch menu and there are a bunch of good things to try. The cheese steak. The pastrami. The tuna. The salmon sandwich was UNBELIEVABLE. (it doesn't really need the bacon) There isn't anything I would not try again. With some lunch meals you get a cookie. (sometimes you have to ask) It is divine. It is chocolate chip, white chocolate chip and butterscotch chips all mixed in a dough. I'm telling you- this is a place to try.   Regarding the picture below about your preferences taking the kitchen more time, you need to know that the chef does it all. She is the owner and chef. She personally makes sure everything goes out of the kitchen right. Also know that this is a new place and they are still working out service kinks.

I can't recommend Charles enough. We have been lucky enough to have him as our plumber for over 20 years. He has fixed and or replaced everything from bath faucets to hot water heaters to kitchen pipes and has done a professional and reasonable job. We have referred him to many people and have always heard positive things back. We have never had any problem he couldn't fix and fix well.

They are growing on me. My favorite Cheese steak place is Philadelphia Sandwich company in Old town. But Corleones just opened here and it's close AND they deliver. Been twice and food was good. And they do their fries well done. Unlike 5 Guys right around the corner in the same parking lot. Plus Corleones has an old Philly favorite- Tastykakes! YAY!!

This is a must try. My sandwich was perfect. Just as I requested on my bag. (If you look at TH's review, I got his sandwich and it was delish) Thanks Todd! We got some of their home made chips and they were meh. Brownie was good. Not too too.  No one was there to help new people so that was a little awkward.We will definitely go back.

Was hoping for a better experience. The reason it gets only one star is because my pet peeve is cold food. Our whole meal was cold. Plus the key ingredient for steaks and hoagies is the roll. It was terrible. Server didn't give a rip. Won't be back.

Went today for lunch with a friend. I started off with the Krombacher Pils. She had..... a different beer. I had the solo burger. She had the Pig Mac. Both burgers were excellent. My bun was a little unsupportive. Burger buns need to have some substance to them so they don't fall apart, which this one did. A double would have been a disaster. We also split an order of fries and they were well done to perfect tubes of goodness. However just as another reviewer mentioned, they are short fries. Maybe an inch long. And then they want you to dip them. Hmmm.   Parking is ok. You either have to pull into the driveway just before it or use the Needlepoint store lot down the street and walk around the corner. It felt a little warm inside. Not sure if the AC was working properly. It's a small place (both sides) and not a lot of seating. KInd of cramped quarters.  Our server was awesome. He mentioned that they hired 50 people to start off with and now they are down to the staff that know their product and will be focused on customer service. Good.   One thing that impressed me was that they offer a service that no one else does.(that I know of anyway) If you have had one too many beers you can hire a cab. It is $20 and two people arrive. One to drive you and one to drive your car to your house. Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?   The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the seating. I'm a short person. Trying to hike myself up onto the high stools isn't easy or ladylike and the only low tables and chairs are outside. In the heat. In Arizona. In the summer. I'm looking forward to trying out the beer garden once it cools off.   Lastly I did take several pretzels home. Just baked and right from the oven. I was pleased with their size and consistency. They were legit.   Next I will go back with my husband and son and try some other goodies- especially the nutella shake! Oh. Yes.  I'll let you know how it goes.

Went again last weekend with my husband. Had the same FABULOUS server- thanks Michael! And they had changed the bun on the burger. Much easier to hold. Still have "short" fries. Guess it's the  Belgian thing...don't know. Anyway, got to sit outside and it was really nice. Give them a try- I don't want them to go away....

Disappointing. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was our server and the person I went with.  (so they each got a star) We had the chopped salad. Nothing on it was chopped. Why call it a chopped salad? I have done kitchen prep before so I know that this plate was sitting with friends on a tray in the fridge until our server went to go get it. It was not fresh lettuce. It was white, hard, some brown, old pathetic lettuce. We shared a pizza which he said he would have cut into 6 pieces and it wasn't. Pizza was unremarkable. Didn't ask us if we wanted dessert. If you are a server a piece of advice is ALWAYS ASK!!! If we say yes, then that's MORE TIP FOR YOU! I went once before to the Norterra location with my husband and I love me a soft pretzel so I was looking forward to trying theirs. I'm from Philly so we are used to pretzels which are sold everywhere (on the street corners to the airport) in sets of three, in a brown paper bag. Theirs was pizza dough in the shape of a pretzel. Hmm. No. The pretzels at Brat Haus were WAAAAAAY better. I probably will not go back.

Tried this place today for the first time. Had a soup/salad combo. I had the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the Shanghai chicken salad. My son had the Milano panini. I was also able to taste the mushroom soup and I plan to get that next time. Food was good. It was a bit disorganized. The guy behind the counter asked me three or more times what I was having and was it for there or to go. They have no way of writing anything down. It's all verbal. And I didn't get my free chocolate covered strawberry :-(

I got a gift from this place and decided to go check it out. $70 later....They have a bazillion different flavors and 7 different sizes. All of the flavors I tried I liked. Why 4 stars? Customer service needs some work. You know kids, they want to do what they want, not what they are asked.

I have tried three times to go to this restaurant for lunch and all three times they were closed. Once on a Saturday. Once on a Monday. And again this past Thursday. Three strikes and you're out. And yes they serve lunch.

New place in our neighborhood. Went to try it out and was pleased. It has nice seating areas and everything we tried we liked. We will go back. Better than Paradise Bakery which has gotten sort of old.

I had heard good and bad about this place but decided to give it a try. I must say that our server- Tony made the visit an exceptional one. His personality was wonderful and we tried everything  he suggested. We split the fish and chips and the pork sandwich. Both were delish. Also tried the butterscotch thingy for dessert and the banana beignets. I have never heard my husband utter the words- Oh wow when it came to a dessert but those banana goodies did it. So we will go back for more Tony soon!! Gotta try the brussel sprout dishes for sure.

We were there on a Friday at 5 PM.   The reason I only gave it 1 star is because the burger was very good and it was made the way I asked for it. My husbands burger was not.  But, the server and the fries left a lot to be desired. Let me preface by saying that we had been to several other locations. I like my fries crispy. I ask for them well done, extra crispy, scorched, tortured hollow tubes. Whatever their buzz word is for well done. EVERY OTHER 5 GUYS HAS COMPLIED. But not the one at TATUM AND SHEA. She said that corporate said they are not to cook the fries that way. So if we were to put up with soggy fries - yes soggy, then we did not want them.   She also interrupted us several times which is rude. THEN she went and called corporate just to double check for us and she came to the table and said no, they were not to cook them that way. Seriously? We did not ask for her to do this. She actually accused us of being undercover shoppers. We started to say something and then again- she interrupted.  Listen, if you explain that our choice is not how the company wishes to present their product and we still choose to have them a different way, you should comply. It is after all our money and our decision. I was raised with the rules that #1 the customer is always right. And #2 if the customer is wrong REFER TO RULE NUMBER 1!!  We will not return. They have lost our business and I hope she loses her job. If you want to try a really good burger AND FRIES place- go to Paradise Valley Burger Company at 40th Street and Bell. You will not be disappointed.  Just watch- I am sure they will have their employees write glowing reviews so the rating will rise.

She's gone. Apparently the employees were happy to see her go as well. If I am so hungry and the other 12 places right nearby are closed I might go again to see if they'll scorch my fries.

Gotta say this is a really nice place. A little difficult to get to but the stores are new and clean and a very beautiful. Once the weather is nice it wil be a lovely spot to hang. It has little living room type areas to sit and relax and wait for your peeps to finish in their stores. Love that there is a Perry Ellis there and no other place has it except Arizona Mills. Also has a nice food court with a variety of places to munch for lunch, dinner or snack.

Great concept. Have it your way...wait...where have I heard that before....Which wich has my vote- hot or cold sandwiches however you want it. My sandwich is a ham with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cucumbers and avocado on a wheat roll. Only complaint was the roll was not that great. I see that they are offering Amoroso's rolls for their cheesesteaks but you have to pay $2 more. Amoroso's as anyone from back east knows- they are the NINJA of rolls. Next time I 'll try them to see how authentic they are.

I ordered some special items for Easter which were a huge hit. I then ordered some graduation pops which my students loved. THEN I ordered the mint chocolate chip and Reese's pieces pops. Plus I had to snag a few others treats while I was there. I live 40 minutes away and it is so worth the drive. Each time the items have been ready to go. Have been beautifully wrapped and absolutely delicious. Thank goodness they aren't closer to me or I would be there all the time. Last time I tried the Costa Rican cold brewed coffee which was so refreshingly good. Thank you to Tricia and her crew for a wonderful experience every single visit.

I used to go here years ago. My son recently got into sushi so we went for the first time in a long time. I used to get the tokyo chicken salad. They have renamed it. It is now called the tokyo chicken slaw. Still yummy. And very reasonably priced.
