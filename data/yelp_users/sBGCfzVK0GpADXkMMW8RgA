The pizza is good if you prefer to have a lot of dough and a little bit of toppings! Not what I expected! Maybe their pasta is better! I'm not sure what the hype is about this place! Go to Vitos if you want really good pizza!!

The hot salsa is good but the service is hit or miss! My husband has insisted on coming here when we are in town but the food is basically mediocre. Not bad but not the best! There are better places in fountain hills that offer better scenery and better food for similar pricing!

The peppers appetizer is awesome and totally different! I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and jalape√±os and my hubby had the wings! Both were fantastic! The grapefruit majito is FANTASTIC! Great patio view and the weather was amazing! I will definitely come here when I'm in town!

Do I have to give it a star? Waited 40 minutes and we still hadn't gotten our drinks and the place wasn't packed. People after us had their drinks before us! We had to ask the waiter to stop and take our order. Half the tables had no food! The service was so bad it hurt! Classic understaffing!!Do not waste your time!

Speedy service! Great customer service overall! The food has been amazing every time I've been there! The street tacos and the onion soup are amazing! If you love spicy then make sure you order the extra spicy wing sauce on the side to use on the tacos! The atmosphere is fantastic too!
