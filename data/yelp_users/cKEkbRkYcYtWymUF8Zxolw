I used to live up the road from here..........how had I never been before???  It was the Chihuly exhibit that drew me in but it was a wonderful experience all around.  I highly recommend checking it out!  While not something that I feel needs to be seen more than once, it's definitely a must see :)

All I have to say is thank goodness they don't have this store back where I am from or I would gain soooo much weight.  This store generously gave both my mom and I a full size candy to try (not just a sliver) and even gave us an extra one for my grandma who was waiting in the car.   Everything we brought home was really really good. I will miss this place but I am sure my waist won't.

As other reviewers have stated......If you are a Jew from NYC, this is the only deli to go to. Beware of Chompies.....everyone will tell you to go there but it just isn't as good as goldman's.  Goldman's has all the staples of a deli that you need. Try their noodle kugel.....sooo good it could be dessert. They also have excellent rye bread to have your sandwiches on.   -1 star because the prices are outrageous and the potato knishes tasted dry to me.

I ran in quickly because I have been looking for a pair of white sandals to take on a trip to Aruba at the end of the month and didn't want to spend a fortune on them. I knew it would be impossible to find white sandals back home in New York this time of year so my only hope was to find them on this vacation in Arizona. I saw a couple pairs at the Paradise Valley Mall but really couldn't justify spending upwards of $40 on a pair of flip flops that I probably won't wear very often and possibly only a couple of times.   Payless saved the day. Not only did I find a decent enough pair of white sandals to meet my needs at $20. I also spotted a very cute pair of black sandals on clearance for just $7---I couldn't resist. I also found a pair of black flats on clearance for $13 and if anybody has ever lived in NYC, you know what a beating your black flats take. I think the 3 pair I currently have at home are all on their last legs (holes in the heels, scuffs at the toes). I was happy to find a cheap pair that I won't care when they get just as ruined as my other, more expensive leather pairs. I couldn't help myself and bought all 3. Whopping total of just $43 with taxes (same as that one pair of flip flops would have been). Good thing I brought a big enough suitcase to get all this stuff home!  4 stars also for the very friendly sales staff :)

While here on vacation, I felt that I was lacking a few essentials to my wardrobe but didn't want to spend a ton of money. I thought I would try out Ross Stores, which are accurately described as hits of misses.   Upon my initial walk in, I thought I would be majorly disappointed. The store seemed half empty of merchandise. However, once I went digging through the racks, I was able to find jeans (that fit great and were so comfortable), a shirt, athletic pants, 4 pairs of underwear, and a new bra. Best part was-----$33 total including sales tax. Where else would this happen at?  Bring me to more Ross stores ASAP!

After many hours of traveling to get from NYC to Arizona, I was exhausted and starving. All I had eaten all day was some crackers and it was the equivalent of past dinner time on the East Coast. I was so happy when my family suggested we venture over to Sweet Tomatoes.  For those not familiar with the place, this place has the largest salad bar you have ever seen. It is literally the length of an entire NYC Avenue. I always take 2 plates for the salad bar as I really don't like my food to touch. They have excellent pre-made caesar salads, asian chicken salads, and joans brocoli. I even tried a pineapple coconut cole slaw this time, which was quite tasty.  I enjoyed making my own salad of lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, raisins, pasta, hard boiled eggs, and asian noodles. They also have the best zesty italian dressing ever.   Afterwards you have choices of soups, potatoes, pastas, and pizzas. I had a sweet potato with honey butter. It was the softest sweet potato and so sweet. I have no idea how they cook it to such perfection. The macaroni and cheese is also nice and creamy.  For desert they have soft serve yogurt machines. I had vanilla with caramel syrup.   The wait staff that comes to clear your plates is always super friendly and brings you fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.   I cant see how anyone could not love this place and I hope to come back at least 1 more time before my trip ends.  # Please bring Sweet Tomatoes to NYC !!!!

Had to come back again before the end of my trip.  Was just as good as the first time.   I will miss you sweet tomatoes and I still beg of you to come to NYC!

Caution: Only come here if you want your hair washed!  I am not afraid to admit it: I hate to pay a lot for a hair cut. Most of the time I don't get what I want anyway and what I always want is very simple: just trim the dead ends off. I refused to pay NYC hair prices for a trim back home and was on vacation with hair that was waaay too long and totally messy. Had I wanted my hair colored: I would be going to the nice, luxury salon, but for a trim, I thought I was safe with supercuts.  Things started off well. I requested a wash, trim, and blowout. They were able to take me right away with no appointment. The hair wash was excellent. I have never had such a relaxing scalp massage.  And then it just went downhill........I lost a few too many inches off my hair, but that was the least of it. I paid extra for the blowout  because I wanted pretty hair. Instead my hair was just dried into a big puffball. I could have done that myself at home for free. Ever since my hair has been in a ponytail.  This experience came to a total of $36. I think i should have just paid $50 somewhere else and gotten a real blowout! I really wanted pretty bouncy hair!

If you are looking for a nice, upscale Italian restaurant this might be where you want to go.   The service was excellent and the food came out of the kitchen very quickly, which was great because I was starving.   Be sure to come here prepared to spend a lot. Even with a $25 off coupon, our bill was quite high. You may want to reserve this place for special occasions but I was very happy that I got to try it!  Things my family tried: I had salmon ala vodka, which was sliced salmon on top of penne in vodka sauce. There was a very generous amount of salmon and it was cooked very well. My family ended up playing musical plates so my mom and grandmother got to try this as well and it ended up being all gone by the end. My stepdad at linguine with white clam sauce. He thought there could have been a few more clams but overall said it tied with a place back in Jersey for his favorite restaurant to have this dish. My mother had a ravioli sampler, which had cheese, lobster, and butternut squash ravioli. She said she enjoyed the butternut squash the best. I think I would have too but the portion wasn't large enough for me to get to try any leftovers. My grandma had a veal dish that was the special for the night. I personally thought it was good but tasted like pot roast. If you are in the mood for pot roast, go with this!---it did happen to be cooked to perfection.

Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.  I came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!  I believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!

If you are in arizona and in search of bagels, bialys, cream cheese spreads, danishes, lox, etc. .......this must become your go to place.  I discovered my family had been purchasing theirs at some other local establishment and it tasted awful. It tasted just as bad as frozen lenders bagels. I immediately told them we were taking a trip (aka 10 minute car ride) over to lox, stock, and bagel and actually stocking up on all the good stuff.   I am also not usually one for small talk, but the owners and employees here and are so friendly that I can never help but to strike up a conversation with them.  You have to check this place out!

I am giving 4.5 stars to the service but just 1 star for the beverage. Here's the story.  I was thrilled to see a jamba juice in the shopping center I was in. I love jamba juice and have my go to: razzmataz that I always request.  This time I came in and as always, ordered a razzmattaz.   I got it and went back in the car. I took a sip and realized it just tasted off. It simply wasn't sweet enough and seemed to be lacking an ingredient. I was going to just suck it up and drink it anyway but I was with my mother and as she said "you should get what you pay for and this wasn't cheap" so she went in and nicely told them that it just didn't taste right.  They very graciously offered to quickly make a new one and even upgraded us to a much larger size. I thought this was great customer service!  Sadly, the drink still tasted like it was lacking the sweetness.  I am not sure if their recipe was off or what but I was left disappointed in the taste.

First off, I would like to thank our waitress for dealing with my pain in the ass family. My family insists on switching tables, placing soup orders when asked what drinks we want, tasting each others drinks/soup and then bugging the waitress to add another to the order. The waitress very calmly put up with all these shaninigans.  We tried a soup to start off with. I believe it was called sedona. If you have ever tasted the smart ones frozen meal "sante fe style rice and beans", it actually tasted like that but in soup format. sounds weird---but was very tasty.   We split 3 different pizzas. All were good but I will list them in order of how good:  1. Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza 2. Thai Chicken Pizza 3. Margarita Pizza   Would definitely recommend this restaurant to fellow yelpers and friends!

Yikes! Where do I begin......  Well it started off with my mom deciding we should order food from here to pick up for dinner. She called and ordered a large pizza: half plain/ half pineapple, 1 cheese calzone, and 1 order of garlic knots. The person on the phone told her to come pick it up in 30 minutes.  30 minutes later we arrive at the restaurant and it is a zoo. I head inside to try to pick up the order and was told it would be a few more minutes. They gave me a cup for a complimentary small soda while I waited.  Well, 1 complimentary small soda turned into 2 complimentary small sodas and a visit from my Mom who got tired of waiting in the car. Another 30 minutes had gone by and we were finally given our food. It was all cold by the time we got home and had to be re-heated.  We chose this place because in past years, it was the only place to get a decent, NY style piece of pizza in Arizona. Well, now I'm not sure if there is a decent NY style piece of pizza in Arizona. The pizza was undercooked and covered in oil (took me 3 napkins to remove it). I took one bite and refused to eat any more of it.   The garlic knots and calzone were decent but not decent enough to redeem this experience.   I'll avoid pizza on my next vacation and just have a decent slice when I get back to NY!

There isn't much I dislike doing more on vacation then having to deal with my hair. Unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with beautiful wash and go hair but I sure wanted to look like I did on a recent trip to Arizona. So, I stopped into Fantastic Sams and asked them to wash and blow my hair. They took me right away and I had very nice looking hair for a few days. Came out to about $22 after tip, which is a couple dollars high for a low end salon like this, in arizona, but it was definitely a price I was willing to pay to not have to deal with my hair for the majority of the trip.  -1 star for the gook these places always put in your hair after styling it. It might help it look nice the first day but it just makes your hair greasier faster and makes you have to wash out your beatiful blowout sooner because of all the oils.

Great happy hour specials. Drinks were readily flowing. Very affordable.   Was disappointed that they didn't have any patio seating left. We were left confined to darkened indoors on such a sunny day. Also, the grilled cheese sandwiches, which I used to love, just tasted different to me, but overall I think this is a place to check out and definitely a bang for your buck!

Very disappointed in the service I received this time around.  This used to be my local library when I lived in Scottsdale for over 2 years. I loved coming here because they had a book sale the size of a NYC apartment filled with paperbacks, hardcovers, and even magazines. I hoped to stock up on some books for an upcoming vacation and dragged my stepdad with me to this library with promises of loads of paperbacks for only 50 cents each. Sadly, when we got there the library was undergoing major construction and the book sale was reduced to the size of a closet. We each only found one book. We were told the other books were probably in a back room somewhere waiting for construction to be over. I was dying for a chance to get into the back room......  I particularly wanted to read a certain James Patterson book right away so I asked the librarian if she had a copy I could borrow (since there wasn't one for sale). She informed me that they had 1 copy of the novel somewhere but wasn't sure where in the library it would be located. ????? This left me ????   So I went off in search of the novel myself amongst the shelves and located all the newer Patterson books including the one that came directly after the one I wanted to read. but the one i wanted was just nowhere to be found.  This trip = fail.  i just didn't have the heart to give it only 1 star because I remain convinced that once construction is done, the library will return to the great library I remembered.

I came in the store because the large amount of clearance items in the front enticed me. However, once I got in......most of it was crap.  However, I did manage to find a couple things. The reason for my poor review was the confusing customer service my family received.   At first, I found a bracelet that I liked so I went to the register and paid for it. While at the register I noticed that they had coupons for $10 off $50 however I didn't expect to be buying enough stuff to qualify so I just paid for my bracelet and thought I was calling it a day.  Then, I noticed my mother was purchasing a couple of items. I also found a sweatshirt on clearance that I really wanted. I realized that if we combined the items , we would be at a total of $48; which is just shy of the $50 required for the discount. So I nicely asked the cashier to return my bracelet so that I could re-buy it along with the other items together. I thought this was a simple request and as there was nobody waiting in line behind me, I figured I wasn't really holding up a line.  The cashier offered my mother the opportunity to open up a Sears credit card in order to get an additional 15% off plus an additional $15 off her first bill. He also told us we could use the initial coupon I had spotted at the register for $10 off $50.  Once he got the credit card all open and charged the items to our card, he then takes a closer look at the coupon and tells us it is not valid until next week. I thought that was pretty deceitful. It shouldn't be at your register if you can't use it this week. I don't plan to come back next week and didn't need to return the bracelet if we weren't going to get the additional $10 off. And then, when I looked closer at the receipts, I realized the cashier never credited the bracelet back to my credit card. Instead, he applied it as a credit towards the new purchases, which means it is still charged to my credit card and it never even would have gotten our total up to where it needed to be if the coupon had been valid.   store gets 2 stars because I like the items we got but I didn't like the confusing processes at the register.

As a New Yorker, I am pretty skeptical of any pizza places outside of my home state, thinking they can't taste as good.   When I lived here, I used to frequent NYPD Pizza but last I visited them, they went waaaaay downhill.  Decided to try Yo Pauly's after reading the reviews on Yelp and I was not disappointed. While I have had better pizza, it was still on par with many pizzza places back home. We had one plain pie and one pineapple pie and I thought both were good.   Would definitely order a takeout pie from here again next time I am in town.

Time to come in Express. They are having  big sales and their sales staff is very nice and very friendly. I didn't have any trouble tracking one down to open a dressing room for me, in fact, they came over and helped me get one started.   I was able to get a cute skirt and a nice shirt on sale for a total of $26  only sad thing for me is I am in between sizes for their pants. Size 2 is too small in the waist and size 4 is too big in the legs and butt. Too bad they don't have a happy medium for people with my body type!

This place made me feel like the ultimate bargain shopper. I love shopping in Arizona this time of year because they have major clearances. I was able to get a pair of black jeans and a dress on sale for a total of $8.75 including taxes. That's like 4 dollars an item! How does this even happen???  The only reason I am not giving it a 5th star is ...........I couldn't find anything else I wanted to buy! I also got stuck in line behind a woman who kept separating her clearance purchases into many separate transactions, then arguing over the rules of her coupons, and then requesting her macys credit card number to be looked up numerous times. I felt the cashier should have told her that she could have one transaction and if she wanted others, she should have to wait until the person behind her (me) paid for her 2 items.

While not as large as some of it's counterparts, i was very happy with their speedy service.   I had just finished a novel before my trip to Arizona and was anxiously awaiting reading the sequel but didn't have time to pick up a copy before my trip and didn't find any at the airport bookstore. I called my Mom and asked her if she could see if Mustang Library had a copy to borrow. She put in a request for it and the day after I arrived, it was waiting at the library for me to pick up. I couldn't have asked for more!

Oh lush burger, I really wanted to like you. You had great happy hour specials, really awesome and friendly/ helpful servers, and tasty drinks (going off my friends on that one bc i just had a soda). The restaurant itself was also set up really nicely with really cool booths outside. I really enjoyed the ambience.  But your food was bad. Really bad. We tried burgers, wings, fries (aka the happy hour menu), and my stomach was literally churning by the end of the meal.   I felt sick for the remaining hours of the evening until I went to bed.   #hire new chefs  I predict this place won't last.

Was very thankful to locate Cougar Cleaners. it's only $2.50 an item so I was able to get all my items dry cleaned before ending my vacation. They were even able to do some shirts that had beading or other embroidery, which most discounted cleaners will turn away.

Came here with my family for dinner after it was recommended to us.   We were told that they often have awesome 2 for 1 daily deals or coupons. We were given ones for 2 for 1 chicken or steak fajitas.   I had the steak fajitas and thought they were delicious. I also had a glass of white zinfandel , which was really good and sweet. My stepdad had a bloody mary and liked it so much he ordered a second ( rare for him). Everyone enjoyed their food/drinks and the wait staff was friendly.  Would definitely return on my next AZ vacation
