This place has definitely changed over the years!  Just found out this location is under new ownership. All the old employees have left and the prices have been raised. The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore.  The chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore. Yuck!  Depending on who is in the back making the tacos results in if you get a taco with barely any meat or a taco filled up properly.  Please bring back your old cook!!!!  The younger woman that is predominately back there now makes them so weak!  You're basically eating tortilla and lettuce!

This was the second time I have been here to pick up some takeout since it's right around the corner, but will never be coming back.  My roommate and I became ill last night about 5 hours after eating here.  This was definitely food poisoning.  We were both up all night sick as heck....  I will spare the details.  We both had to call in sick to work today as well!  I have already filed a complaint with the Board of Health...  Also, check out the picture that someone posted on here of their storage area.  Had I seen that I would never have set foot near this place.  Beware!!!!!

You guys were great!  First I enjoyed the free valet parking.  Second, I thought it was very cordial that I was offered a water by the front desk staff.  Next I loved that I was seated right when I arrived and the work began.  I loved, loved, loved, the fact that I didn't have to do a million X-rays.  The office was also decorated very sophisticated and urban which goes nicely with the downtown vibe.  Very clean also!  After raving about it, my partner is now going to become a client and my best friend who lives at 44 Monroe right across the street is going to switch over as well.  Keep up the great work guys!  Very impressed!

This location is directly next to my condo complex and I only frequent it due to convenience and laziness. If you have time to go somewhere else, please heed my warning and do!!!!  Today was the 4th time in a row of going there that my simple order was screwed up. A turkey sub hold the cucumbers add sprouts came out as a turkey sandwich without lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts or cheese; which I didn't see until I unwrapped it at home. Basically it was just meat on a bun!  Normally I just drive back to the drive thru and politely have them correct it, but today I was fed up and went inside. Sandwich was slammed on the counter and I asked the manager how difficult the job of preparing a sub with the order slip directly in front of you was. I let her know this was the 4 th time in a row of them screwing up my order. She rectified the situation and even reimbursed me for my sub which I didn't ask for.  My frustration level had finally peaked. After reading some of the other reviews, this seems to be an ongoing problem!  Also, it took me 11 mins to get through the drive thru with only one car in front of me because two of the workers had their heads out the window flirting with the girl in the car in front of me after she had paid and received her food. No shame!  This place needs a new staff and management that knows how to keep them in line and run a successful location.

Downtown Phoenix has been needing a place like this for sometime!  Beautiful space, great cocktails and delectable food!  I would highly recommend this place to others!  I would chalk up the bad reviews to surburbanites!  Sorry it wasn't comparable to Chilis!  Lol!
