I'll never go there again. At times the food is served cold and the service is slow. I remember during happy hour a bartender (Not Mike or Joey) broke a glass cup on the counter above the ice. Instead of cleaning and removing the entire ice box he only cleaned up the large pieces. He continued serving drinks to customers using the same ice. I had to complain to another employee before he finally removed the ice from bar. If you have a stomach ache after a night of happy hour now you know why.

If you're looking for a new place to have lunch, I would highly recommend Whole Foods Market. They have 6 to 7 different areas where they server food. Pretty much any type you want. Everything is freshly made. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable great place for family and friends. It's not just a grocery store it's also a restaurant.

Their entire menu is awesome. During my lunch hour I order the westerner with a side of mac and cheese. One of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. The sides they serve are also worth checking out too. They have barbecue beans, backed potato casserole, coleslaw, and much more. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves outdoor BBQ. I will definitely be back soon enough.

Pros: Great food, Professional staff Cons: Slow service, Expensive drinks  On June 4th, I stopped by Habanero's on the corner of Butherus Dr and Northsight Blvd for some tacos. It was 2:00pm, and hoped I'd missed the lunch crowed. I wasn't expecting many people to be eating during that time. The line at the lunch counter was about five people deep when I walked up and another three people were waiting to pay at the register. I've heard this place could get busy, but this was a little too much of a wait for me.  Other than the wait, my experience at Habanero's Mexican Grill was positive. Again, the staff is friendly and tacos are great! This is the only reason I decided to wait out the line for a table. If you ever find yourself waiting and thinking about going somewhere else. Don't do it, tacos are worth the wait.

If you like fades this is the place to be. They have the best staff and they are friendly and knowledgeable. I go here all the time and the wait is never too long. Los and Lily are great people, so is the owner. They also have offer hot shaving cream and a straight blade finish. Not sure what their history is, but they have a bright future. I recommend this place.

Pros: Great pricing, Professional staff, Large selection Cons: Slow to stock products  On July 4th, I stopped by Sprouts on the corner of Miller Dr and Camelback Blvd for some beers. It was 2:00pm, and hoped I'd missed the last minute crowed. I wasn't expecting many people to be there during that time because of the Holiday. The line at the checkout counter was about five to six people deep when I walked up and another three people were waiting to pay at the register.  Other than the wait, my experience at Sprouts Farmers Market was positive. Again, the staff is friendly and helpful. The butcher and deli counter are quick and knowledgeable.
