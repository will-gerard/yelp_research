I really love getting smoothies and checking out small smoothie shops but I was a little disappointed with this one.   My smoothie was bland, tasted mostly like the soy milk ingredient, and I noticed that all the smoothie are juice and sherbet based and don't actually have fresh fruit in them. bummer.  I tried the acai smoothie, which had acai juice, raspberry juice, sherbet, and soymilk in it and it was ok.   These smoothies need fresh fruit ingredients!

I am always impressed by this art museum. They have amazing exhibits, wonderful touring exhibitions, and an awesome contemporary and modern art collection.   I love the atmosphere of this museum. The layout of the museum is fantastic and it's very fun to walk around. I like how they give plenty of space between each painting so that you can stop at look at a piece and you're not in someone else's way. Also, the staff at this museum is very friendly and helpful which you do not find at every art museum. They're willing to answer silly questions and they know alot about each of the exhibits which is awesome.  Some of my favorite pieces were: Frida Kahlo's The Suicide of Dorothy Hale The Tatiana Sorokko exhibit with beautiful dresses and a photo collage And some of the larger installations in the contemporary art collection  Also, Wednesdays after 3, the Phoenix Art Museum is free!

I love this place!  The restaurant itself has an amazing ambience and the food is amazing! We always check this place out after a busy day of shopping.   Very reasonably priced and very, very good.

My dogs are going to love the treats and toys we got from Wag N Wash! This place is awesome. There's pretty much everything you need for your dog at this store, plus awesome service, plus a dog wash. So cool.   It was my first time visiting this store but everyone was so helpful and all the dogs there seemed really happy and friendly, even though they were about to get a bath or they had just gotten cleaned!   Also, they had an awesome selection of dog treats, that were of all different varieties, shapes and sizes. I bought a big tin of dog training treats and I'm sure my dogs will love them.  This place is definitely worth checking out if you need something new for your dog or if your dogs need a bath!

Western Delights is such a cute store! My aunt and I went in there to check out there jewelry and there were so many gorgeous necklaces, bracelets, earrings and antique jewels there. I ended up buying a pair of earrings with blue stones and I love them.  This store supports local artists, has reasonable prices, and the owner is super friendly and helpful. My aunt and I tried on a bunch of different pieces and the lady at the store knew so much about each one.  I definitely recommend checking out this place the next time you're in the Scottsdale area and looking for jewelry from local artists.

I love Coffee Bean! And I love this one because they have friendly baristas who are very knowledgable and helpful.  I checked out this place last week and ordered some tea lattes and a mocha and everybody was happy with their drinks. And I bought some of their peach oolong tea to make iced tea with. So good!  Way to be amazing Coffee Bean. I want one in my neighborhood!

There are some really interesting finds at Rust and Roses for indoors and outdoors. From antiques to new pieces of furniture, this place has some really beautiful pieces.   I really liked the antique paintings and jewelry at the store and there were some really cool hand crafted items.   Definitely a cool place to check out.

What a fun place to go for Italian food on a Friday night!  So I checked out Tutti Santi with my aunts, uncles, cousins and other relatives, there were more than twelve of us, and I was expecting the service to be a little bit slower because our party was big but instead we received excellent service. Everyone ordered very different options from the menu, my cousin ordered the chicken special, and we were all very happy with our meals.   And we were consistently checked up on by the waiters, our glasses were always full, and we left stuffed from the pasta.   And their spaghetti and meat sauce was delicious! My favorite!
