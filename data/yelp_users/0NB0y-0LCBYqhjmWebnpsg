So here's the deal. I gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch. I had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me. When she returns to work I realize they gave me chicken and shrimp. It's an inconvenience to drive there and get a new bowl, but not a big deal as I work about 3 miles from here. They give me a new bowl with steak and shrimp and I go back to work. As I get back and start to eat, I find a small black hair!! Gross, but it was solely on a piece of shrimp so I threw it away and the food surrounding it. I continued to eat and then found another hair..... I have obviously lost my appetite... I call them and they apologize and tell me they will refund me. I drive back there and wait in line to return my food. As I'm doing so an employee goes to refill a soy sauce bottle and drops the top into a box on the ground. The employee then proceeds to put the top back on the bottle unwashed. This last act is what prompted me to write the review. Unfortunately I will not be eating here again....  I will add I did get refunded.

The food was phenomenal!! It was a tad bit on the expensive side, but it was def the best breakfast steak I have ever had! If you like coffee this is the place to visit! I'm giving it 4 stars just because it was a little over priced. Other wise we would go back again!

I just paid $24.00 to have my car washed here.  They didn't vacuum well at all and they didn't wipe down half of my car! This is such a poor job! I will never go here again! I wish Yelp would let me post more pictures.
