Had an issue with this Village Inn, and the general manager was quick to contact me. The attention to customer satisfactory and the urgency to resolve is refreshing. Thank you, Jennifer.

I went to this Wendys on my lunch break and asked for 2 cheesy cheese burgers and a frosty. It said 2 jr bacon cheese burgers on the menu and O asked if they were the cheesy cheeseburgers at the window and during ordering. I was told yes. I opened my bag and there was 2 jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. Not satisfied. Wasting my time on my lunch break. Went back because they over charged me and I had to go a second time. Manager did not seem sympathetic and seemed like she cared more about her sales and drive thru times than correct orders and customer satisfaction.

The ladies at the store were very helpful, knowledgeable, and were refreshingly bright in personality. The employee with the pixie cut had an infectious aura around her of happiness. Her likeness was a splitting image of the character, Joy, from Inside Out.

The pies were a little bit pricey. I got the banana cream pie, the french silk, and the peanut butter dream. The banana cream pie tasted like it had green bananas in it, and it was very bland. The french silk tasted more like dark chocolate than french silk. Haven't tried peanut butter dream yet. The dinner rolls are the best thing I have eaten from this place so far. Cheryl was wonderful when I called in and was very helpful and gave descriptions of each pie I asked about.

Cheryl contacted me a few days after my review and asked me to stop in again. She told me that her pies had a 100% guarantee. I had the blueberry cheesecake, pecan pie and pumpkin pie. I ate all of the cheesecake in one sitting woth my man, it was so good. My dad sent me a message telling me how tasty the pecan pie was and how yummy it is warm with a vanilla ice cream scoop on top. Mom said the pumpkin was the best she ever had.  Definitely will be coming back.

Jenny makes the best drinks. She is quick, imaginative and intuitive. She made me a peach cobbler drink, an orange dreamsicle, and a blueberry white Russian. Will be definitely coming back because of her. Sweet as the drinks She makes.

The ladies here are always sweet, the donuts are always fresh, and the taro boba is my favorite.

This place is so sickingly sweet that I can smell the sacrificial virgins from 6.66 miles away. Love the Happy Camper. I am definitely in kitty cat heaven. Meow. :3

This hole in the wall ice cream shop is fresh and gorgeous. The store is lined with gorgeous art prints for sale. Try Purple Rain, formerly known as Blueberry Muffin. It is far away from me, but definitely worth the drive.
