Don't switch to Verizon!!!!  This store has the worst service  hands down I've ever received from a Verizon store, and I've been to many throughout the past 15 years.  The fact that I have had to return to this store three times in three weeks to fix a small battery issue on my phone, and I have left each time with the phone in a worse condition than when I brought it there is unacceptable.  Also, each time I have waited between 45-90 minutes just to be seen (although they get my name and know the problem I am back with).  I now have a defective phone that doesn't work, and since it is only a few months old, the store finally ordered me a "new one" which came as a "refurbished like new" phone.  When I took the phone back to the Verizon store to make sure that all my contacts would transfer, they messed up my cloud and I lost over 100 contacts in the transfer to the "new" phone.  Upon arrival at home, to my horror, the battery died quicker than my old phone AND the two buttons (back and open apps) don't work, so it's not even usable.  Fast forward to my next visit to Verizon (waiting over an hour this time to be seen) to transfer the information back to my old phone (all the contacts were showing up "unknown" so I could send the refurbished one back, they tried to clear the contacts and I ended up with none that worked.  I went again the next day (they told me to go home and the "cloud" would update the phone), waited 90 minutes, and after 2 hours working on it, they were unable to update any contacts at all, so now I have two unusable phones.  I've called Verizon three times to get an actual new phone sent, and they refuse to send me a new phone (only refurbished, even though my old phone which was new a few months ago doesn't work).  Do yourself a favor it you're thinking about moving to Verizon...don't do it!  And if you're already with Verizon and need help, do NOT go to this store...they will not help and will only make things worse.  I can only hope that with all the cellphone companies to choose from, I've saved someone the frustration of going with them.

Expensive, but great food.  I got lucky with dinner for two and a bottle of wine through Groupon, but what they didn't say was it was about $20 towards a bottle of wine, and only 3 were close to that price.  Food was excellent for the Groupon price, and service was great!

I used to love this place.  Great atmosphere, awesome selection of wines, and live music.  Each time I've returned in 2015 has been worse though.  The past few times I've ordered food, it has not been good, so I just decided to order hummus and nuts.  Both were horrible (the hummus was a black bean hummus and the nuts were soggy), and it would take 15-20 minutes for our waitress to come back to the table to see if anyone needed anything (and with a group of 6, we continued to sit and wait for wine, water, and food).  It was very hot in the building, and the worst part was that she over charged us by $40.  When we brought it to her attention, she told us it was too difficult to change, went through each item, and didn't change anything even though she agreed it was incorrect.  I will not be going back, which is a shame, as up until a year ago it was one of my favorite places to catch up with friends.

I wouldn't normally head to Mesa for a movie, but ended up meeting some friends there to watch Jurassic World.  The best part about this theatre is their seating!  Reserving seats in advance is a great way to ensure you'll have a good seat during the show, and every seat has a foot rest that comes up from the bottom of the super comfy chairs so you can watch a new movie with your feet up!  Some chairs even allow the armrest to be raised, so it makes for a romantic movie night :)  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this theatre.

Not your typical dinner show...this one had more engagement and participation from the audience than I've ever experienced from a murder mystery dinner!  The food left something to be desired, but let's be honest, that's not why you go to these shoes (plus, it wasn't all that bad).  The actors served the dinner, and really made it a fun time.  But word of advice, if you get embarrassed easily, or don't like to participate in shows, this may not be the one for you...although they have a full bar so you may just need a drink or two to feel more comfortable and enjoy the show...it's worth it ;)

I love Picazzo's for a few key items that I can't get anywhere else.  For a dinner, they have an amazing Chopped Italian salad that you can substitute kale for free (and make sure you do it!).  Actually, kale can be substituted for free on any of their salads so you really can't go wrong, but this one is by far my favorite.  Also, if you're in the mood for something small (or an appetizer prior to your meal), their cranberry jalapeno hummus is amazing!  Go there for happy hour to get 50% off any of the appetizers (and this one is well worth it!).  The service is always great as well, and they're always offering fun monthly specials.  I'd give them a 5 stars, but I've tried three different pizzas, and wasn't impressed with any of them, so if you stick with the salad, you'll never go wrong!

Great happy hour specials...especially the "Weekend Hangover" burgers every Saturday and Sunday from 11am-4pm.  Perfect place to cheer on my favorite Wisco teams with friends!

I've never been disappointed in this place.  Now that it's summer, they have a $20 summer special where you get a salad, pizza, and two glasses of wine...perfect for a dinner date :)  I love their turkey feta salad, and you can ask to substitute the lettuce for spinach which is even more amazing!  We tried the chicken pesto pizza for the first time, and wasn't disappointed at all.  I always love stopping by for a nice casual dinner...there's so much to choose from!

I've never had a bad meal at North, but I'm usually heading here for their great Happy Hour specials.  You can't beat their "bottle and board" (bottle of red or white wine, and a chef's board) for $20, but you can also grab some pizza and other snacks for a discount price during happy hour.  Other than happy hour specials, their pricing is pretty high, but worth it.  Adding chicken to their kale salad is my favorite dish for dinner, and they have outdoor seating where you get some great people watching (and if you're lucky, one of the couches on the patio is available).  Overall, great place to eat and catch up with friends :)

This is hands down one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix!  I got lucky buying a Groupon for Annie (I didn't even know the Arizona Broadway Theatre existed), and was thoroughly entertained!  It was fun to get dressed up to have dinner, then see a show right after...loved the concept.  I had such a great time I ended up reserving a table for 6 to their New Year's Eve "Vegas" themed show for my family who came to town for the holidays.  My parents thought it was the best time they have ever had for NYE, and are still talking about it!  I would have given it 5 stars but the food leaves something to be desired.  I warned them it would be bland and not great, but the place is so well put together and so entertaining, it's easy to overlook the quality of the food and have a great time!  The salads are good, and desserts are hit and miss.

I absolutely love this place!  They have a great selection of imported beers (it's always fun to try something new from different countries), and an excellent selection of wine!  My favorite part is the wine tasting on weekends, where you get to try a wide selection of wines before buying (and if you buy what you tasted, you get a discount on the bottle!).  The staff has always been very friendly, and will help find any wine you are looking for (and if they don't have it, give you some recommendations on bottles they have in stock).  The only reason that I did not give them a 5 stars, is because last weekend I arrived at the store 7 minutes after their scheduled stop time for the wine tasting, and they wouldn't let me try any of the wines they had out (they had not put any away yet, and I was the only one in the store wanting to try the wine - would it really hurt to stay open an extra 5 minutes so I could taste before buying?).  It was disappointing because I go there every week to buy wine, and I look forward to trying something new (which I don't like doing without tasting it first).

This was the best happy hour we've been to in a long time.  Not only were the food specials unbelievable (both in variety and price!), but an added bonus was that it was "wine down Wednesday" so we got a bottle of wine for 1/2 price!  Our server was wonderful...very attentive, happy, and provided us great insight on some of the food and drinks (he even corked the bottle for us to take home what was left).  After Wednesday night's amazing experience, I know we will be frequenting Kona Grill much more often!

Most people go here for the pizza, but I love the fries and wine...especially during happy hour :)

I have been going to this nail salon for years, as it is close to my home and I used to get great service.  I'm not sure when the current owner took over, but I just had the worst pedicure I've ever experienced.  I decided to get there ten minutes early (and I'm glad I did), because the seven minutes in the chair prior to my pedicure was the most relaxing part of it.  When the girl came over to start, I showed her that I had a cut that was healing on my big toe and to be careful, and within two minutes (while cutting my nails), she hit it and it broke open.  The entire pedicure was over within 15 minutes (and yes, that includes the nail polish drying), and the whole thing felt so rushed that I actually felt worse than when I came in.  I'll mention that the previous time I had gotten a pedicure (about 3 weeks prior), another girl had cut open my foot and it started bleeding.  I should not have gone back, but since I've been going here for years, I gave them the benefit of the doubt (maybe this was her first day) and went back.  I will not be going back again with these owners, and if they want to keep their business, they should take a long, hard look at who they are hiring, and how satisfied their customers are when they leave.

We were actually heading next door for dinner, when I saw this restaurant.  It looked like a cute place (people sitting on the patio and flat screens all over), and I was craving some chips and salsa so we decided to check it out.  They brought us a basket of chips with a small bowl of their fresh salsa.  I ordered the triple salsa so I could try three more (pico, habanero, and tomatillo) for $5.  The pico was okay, tomatillo was a little sweet, but the habanero was AMAZING (super spicy with a great flavor!).  I had the skinny margarita (really good), ordered the nachos for dinner, and my boyfriend ordered quesadillas.  My nachos were amazing!  Although every chip was covered with toppings, they did not get soggy throughout dinner.  The chips served with the salsa were fresh and crispy, and I used them to eat some of the additional toppings that were falling off the nachos.  My boyfriend also ate the nachos with me (we didn't even finish them!) and only ate 1 piece of his quesadilla (there were 4).  He said the quesadilla was alright, but we both agreed the nachos were awesome!  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, though.  Our waiter was very friendly and ensured we always had what we needed.  Overall, this is a great spot and I'm glad we ended up stumbling into it on a Sunday night for dinner :)

They are great here!!  I've been back so many times and absolutely love everyone I've had.  They don't rush pedicures, and do such an amazing job, my polish usually stays on for two weeks or more without chips :)

This place has great breakfast and lunch when heading out of town.  I almost always go with the Spicy Super Greens salad to take on a long flight (it also comes with a slice of fresh bread).  When I'm at the airport early, a scrambled eggs and passion fruit iced tea is perfect for breakfast before a flight.  This is one of my favorite restaurants at the airport :)
