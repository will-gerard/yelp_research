I am confused about all the hype. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza (which was on special for 11.99) and 20 wings. My order came out to $34.00.  Holy shit! $1.10 per wing? Are you serious? "Better be some damn good wings", I thought to myself..  Homie on the phone said my delivery would take 30-45 minutes. Ya.. No. Add an hour to that.   Pizza and wings finally arrived, and I was fucking starving.. Honestly.. the pizza was bad. I want chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and stretchy cheese. Pizza Heaven offers none of these mandatory pizza components..  The wings were soggy on the outside, and over cooked on the inside. The meat was tough, and stringy.  What a waste of time, and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-

For a Subway.. This is the best one I have been to. It's right by my office, so I have only been there during lunch time. The staff is awesome. I am always greeted when entering. The workers are fast, and get your order right every time. One of their employees during the lunch shift seems to keep it all together. He manages the other employees well ,and is extremely friendly. Not sure what his name is.. but someone needs to give the black dude with the earrings a big raise. As far as Subway goes, this one is the best-

Walked up in here with an empty spot in my belly.. knowing that only one thing would be able to fill this void.. Burger.  Ordered me a damn PCG Burger medium with fries.. and immediately wished I had asked for a rare preparation. I think our server was some sort of Sookie Stackhouse fairy or some shit cuz that burger came to me lightly seared n delicious. Fuckin fried jalepenos, and some green pepper saucy shit all over that beast.   I ate, and laughed loudly with a coworker, and equipment rep.. we pretended we were cavemen huddled around a fire.. dirty, our wives locked up in their respective caves.  PCG did it. They did it right. Our hostess looked like the lady from the pit in Army of Darkness though.. just a little shorter-  One-

..my original review was deleted due to violating Yelp's Content Guidelines or Terms of Services.  Not sure how, or why. I think you all should know how bad the food was here, and how dirty the establishment was inside before you waste the trip. I also made a point to note that being of a specific ethnic origin does not automatically grant you a superior palate which can taste food from that origin better than the next person.  Bottom line: The kitchen was a disgusting wreck when I was able to peek back in there. The food gave me food poisoning, and was hands down the worst I've had. It is hard for me to respect a business who doesn't respect their customers enough to sweep the floor-

5 stars all day every day. My family has been dining at Desert Jade for about 15 years, and never have we been disappointed. Not once. Not even close. We typically order lettuce wraps, and sizzling rice soup to start. Then a few entr√©es for everyone to share. I think we have tried the whole menu! I used to order certain items to be a dick.. like the worst sounding stuff on the menu, but the joke was on me because many of them became family favorites (hint: you MUST get the asparagus). All the food we've ordered was fresh. Wait staff is always on point. The prices are more than reasonable. Best Chinese food I've had. Nobody else is even in the same ballpark. I am not sure what those few people who left poor reviews were on.. probably meth. I imagine them eating lots of kraft mac n cheese with cut up hotdog in it, and a side of ketchup.. They just don't know quality. DJ till I die bitch-

Came here for Mother's Day brunch at Dobson's Restaurant. Our waitress was the worst. She did things like not bring cream for coffee when kindly asked.. I had to get up, and go grab coffee creamer for my mom at their beverage station. My wife ordered french toast and specifically asked for whipped cream to be excluded from the order. Ya.. whipped cream all over. She was nowhere to be found most of the time, but when she was around, the bitch was fucking something up.  Food was weak. Totally not worth the 30 bones per person for buffet. Milk and OJ are extra.. Prime Rib, Eggs Benny, and Salmon Wellington were the main foods. None were good. Nothing I ate made me say, "This is why they charge 30 bucks." Everything I ate made me say, "I wish we had gone somewhere else." I shelled out 100 dollars for 3 people to eat shitty food, and experience shitty service.  My wife pointed out a dead cockroach as we were about to leave. Yuck.  Fuck this place. Do not eat here. I want my 100 dollars, and 2 hours back.

I woke up with a mean hang over on Saturday in dire need of some greasy diner breakfast. My roommate told me this place was close, and that she had heard it was decent. Sweet! a breakfast close to the new pad!   Nope  Walked in to a podium type stand with a hostess behind it. She had her head down. She didn't look at me, and didn't greet me either. She grabbed 2 menus and started walking over to a booth. Half way there, she looked back at me because she probably sensed that I wasn't tailing her. "Oh!" I said.. "You are seating us". I sat down and brushed her shitty service off.  We sat at that booth for about 8 thirsty minutes before my breakfast partner grabbed the next waitress walking by to ask for water. That waitress was very nice. She took our orders, apologized for the wait. She said our real waitress would be over to help us with anything else needed.  Our real waitress:  Looked like she hadn't slept in 2 weeks, and had about 3 or 4 hickeys on her neck. Show some class girl!  I had a veggie skillet with 2 eggs over medium, instead of scrambled. The eggs were under cooked for over medium. Everything was bland. My roomie just got scrambled eggs and bacon, which she said were fine.. but how do you fuck that up? Maybe I am a snob. Even though the food was crap.. A smile and greet upon entering, and speedy service would have been worth another star to me. Fuck this place.

Best Sushi in AZ so far in my opinion. The Citrus Roll is unreal. I have been here 5 times now, and each time was great, minus one visit. That one time, they were slammed and my rolls were not on par with how they were on other visits.   Last night, we went for my best friend's b-day, and Yoshi (the owner I think) gave the b-day boy a free "Stamina Drink".. I had a small sip it. Tasted like isopropyl alcohal on ice with a splash of grape flavor. So.. pretty legit.   On the way out, Yoshi told my friend, "Your life is wrong!" then burst into laughter. This was hilarious to me. I asked my friend if maybe he meant, "Your life is LONG?" maybe just a pronunciation error?? But WRONG is much funnier. Good Times :)

One star because I can't give less. I recently bought an engagement ring here. My salesbitch was Marilyn. I had an idea of the style ring I wanted, also had a strict budget in mind. After explaining to Marilyn what my stipulations were, she immediately handed me a ring about $2500.00 over what I could afford. "Get the fuck out ouf here", I thought.... "get me something else please"- She pulled out some comparable choices.. minus the Neil Lane name brand, and one of them caught my eye. "I really like this one!" I said to her.. "Great! Should we sign paperwork, and take it off the shelf?" Errr!! I hate pushy sales people. I told her to hold on. This was a big chunk of change for me, and I needed a moment to collect my thoughts. I asked her to explain to me exactly what I was buying.. though I knew what I was buying.. I wanted to detour her pushiness a little for a sec to think about my decision. We went back and forth for a bit about payment options and interest. She explained that since my purchase was over 5k..  I was eligible for an 18 month 0% interest payment. This was exactly what I needed. I then asked her about trading in another ring I had bought a couple years back for the wrong person (i never gave it to her). Marilyn told me she was able to give me full trade in for it! This was now looking like a sweet deal for me.. Well looks can be deceiving. Marilyn failed to mention that the trade in took money right off the end of my purchase.. forcing me under that 5k.. and out of that 18 month no interest range. As I left though, she was still saying "that 18 month no interest will be nice".. Real deceptive.   I called to set up a time for me to come in an pay my 20% down which is what I was told would qualify me for that 18 month gig. The lady on the phone said that I wasn't able to receive that deal because my purchase was under 5k.. She told me I would have one year no interest.. then 6 months stupid crazy interest. I was pissed. I asked for Marilyn. Marilyn got on the phone and said she would try and pull some strings with corporate to get me what i needed. She said she would try and get my transaction to show the trade in after I had made the purchase, and that she would call me right back.  An hour later she called and said corporate wouldn't go for it.. and that I was pretty much screwed.   Fuck Jared. Don't go there, and please tell all your friends. I got bamboozled. I was very careful too. Asked a ton of questions.. the whole bit, and I still got fucked. I am thinking about sitting out front in the heat with a sign reading, "Ask me why you shouldn't make your big purchase here" this Saturday.. Maybe try and get 3 on my side or something-

For real.. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh.. Cheese... Lettuce. Sour cream. Overall plain as fugg..   I decided to give them another try, cuz I was craving some damn menudo, and no place has menudo during the week. Me and my coworker Fernando hit up the FBH at 11am. I ordered menudo.. Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, "skuse me..deyyzz supposed ta be sep-rit oah-duz."  the clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!"  The shit was disrespectful as hell.  Whatever.. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle.. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre-made soup.. pour it into a styrofoam container.. put a lid on it.. put it in a brown bag.. toss a pre-made baggie of onion and cilantro in.. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread.. toss that shit in the bag.. and shout out a nigga name.  Nah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes!!! Then I took that shit out of the bag! "WTF is this???" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH.. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here-

Ok. I can't help but skip to the sub par reviews here to see what these people could possibly complain about. Haha- I love this: "I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say "my" friends)." Because Glob forbid sharing friends with your siblings right?!? OMG, what a snob! This person's review had me ready to head over to Scottsdale Fashion Square with a rifle. Haha, not really, but I have been listening to Malcolm X speeches all morning, so those have me a little amped. Maybe squirt guns filled with hydrogenated oil. Go to Bosa's. Get a donut. Love it. Then do some jumping jacks. I have been here many times, and have not had a bad experience. The girl who assembled my Office Ass Kissing Platter this morning was extremely polite. The donuts were tits.. as always-

I stopped in here for the first time with Emma, and 2 of our best friends after a Superstition Mountain hike. The 4 of us have enjoyed sushi together at multiple locations between Mesa and Los Angeles. One ongoing competition between us is finding the best sushi spot in AZ. I could not give Sushi Kee 5 stars because it is not the best sushi I have had. A few Cali spots I have checked out just cannot be beat in my opinion. As far as AZ sushi however, I think Sushi Kee takes the cake. All 4 of us left here completely satisfied. Prices were right. Portions were generous. Atmosphere was comfortable. Fish was fresh. If you are into sushi joints where screaming at your friends is necessary in order to carry out a conversation because top 40 is blaring through speakers overhead.. ahhem Glue-Raw-Sabi..then Sushi Kee is not for you.

I can't believe Dave B's crumby review. What a troll. DeFalco's is consistently delicious. Dave B... I hope your silly hat blows off the next time you put the top down on your Miata.  I have explored the menu, and enjoyed everything I have tried. My go to menu item is the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. DeFalco's nails it every time.

I had a good time here last night. I didn't like having to shell out 10 bucks for cover, but my buddy was showing some art, and I wanted to see it. This place was packed with an eclectic crowd. It was good to see hippy chicks on acid mingling with jaw clenching metal heads, and e-tard ravers. Seriously..everyone was on drugs here. Even the bartender was spigacked out of her mind. Drinks were reasonable, so that made up for the cover charge. Met some nice people. Heard some good beats inside. Laughed at the band outside covering War Pigs (not because it was bad, I just didn't expect it.)

I didn't really notice the attitude everyone else is posting about. People were generally nice. I danced obnoxiously with my crew, and some drunk girl tried to kiss me on the lips.. then she collapsed in a drunken fit. I had a good time here, and would visit again. Parking was easy to find upon arrival, but taxis and cop cars blocked our way when trying to leave. Give it a try, but prepare yourself for some queer guy drama..I saw a couple lil scuffles-

Sorry, I had to subtract because I came in here for lunch with a coworker.. we ordered at the same time.. his meal came out quickly.. mine did not. My plate came out about 10 minutes after his.  Yesterday, I brought my roommate in for dinner. Again! his meal came out first, and mine was late! Only 5 minutes this time.. but still. Neither of our meals were anything special. I had the roasted duck. Menu say half duck.. I got part of a thigh, and more bones than meat on my plate. My buddy got a seared lamb dish which he said just did not taste good. Step Your Game Up Tao Garden.. I will be back to check on you for lunch someday-

The service here was the best part of my experience. Our waitress was on it, and gave the perfect amount of attention without being annoying. I ordered the Green Curry with crispy tofu.. Thai hot. Sometimes Thai restaurants will skimp on the heat when I order this way, but Yuhpa's did not. I highly recommend this plate.. Very good! My fiance went with the Pad thai, and her dish was great as well. Coconut ice cream to cool off with after dinner was yummy. This will be my go to spot for Dinner and a Movie in the Pollack Center.. even though the theater bums me out sometimes.   Yupha's Thai Kitchen ranks among my favorite Thai restaurants in the valley, and I am excited to explore their menu.

What a bummer. I came for lunch, and ordered a Hot Hero for something like 7.99. When a tiny sandwich, on a big plate found it's way to my table, I couldn't help but giggle. A little roll, with sauce, a couple slices of sausage, and some cheese. Taste wise, I give this thing a 2.5 out of 5. Portion wise.. a 2.. Service was service. Our waiter had no personality. I am curious about the dinner entrees, cuz that shit did sound amazing. Lunch was wack as f*** tho. I don't want to detour you from eating here, cuz I imagine the dinner is probably decent, based on other reviews I have read. Just don't get a sandwich.

Ok.. so I saw quite a few Blue Adobe to Dick's Hideaway comparisons in the reviews. Dick's Hideaway is my favorite Arizona Restaurant, so I had to give it a shot. I pulled into an empty parking lot.. not a good sign. Walked into an empty restaurant.. another bad sign. I was worried that maybe I had selected a dud for the date night I had set up with my fiance who was meeting me there. I sat down, and immediately ordered a carafe of margarita. Then I watched my server pour a shit load of booze into the carafe, before adding his other flavors.. a great sign! Pamela showed up, to a glass full of potent, and tasty margarita.. and some of the better chips and salsa I have had.   Our waiter, who was awesome btw.. recommended the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. This is what I ordered. Pamela got the Oscar Medallion: A small steak with crab meat on top of it, served with pasta and asparagus.  My enchiladas were legit. Tender pork, delicious chili sauce. Cheesy, meaty, tortilla-y goodness. Highly recommended. Pamela's steak was perfectly cooked, and was butter knife slice able. The crab on top was a nice touch. The pasta however, was a real miss. It was a super limp, greasy mess on the plate. Very heavy.. not appetizing. Neither me, or my fiance cared for it.   Back to the Margaritas. I am not big on margaritas. They sometimes give me heart burn. Blue Adobe Grille's Killer Margarita was great. That carafe got my chick drunk. It got me a little tipsy, and I can hold my own. It was tasty. Not too sour. Not too sweet. No chest pain.  I am not sure why this place was empty. My friend told me that when he had visited, it smelled like a mop and bucket inside. It smelled fine in there to me. I did notice complaining about his in other reviews though. Minus the pasta, my experience was awesome. I will be back to explore their very affordable menu. Maybe drink some margaritas, and watch he game at the bar-

I ate here because the other restaurant in the complex was closed (I always seem to forget that Pho Van is closed on Wednesday).  My Experience:  Walked in to a funky smell.. decided to risk eating here despite the fishy stench.  Seated. Water Delivered.. at this time my wife and I knew what we wanted, so we ordered. Wife gets chicken pho.. I order the Bun Bo Hue, and our waiter tells me they are out of pork blood. We also order spring rolls.  5 minutes later another couple is seated near us. Their order is taken.  5 minutes later that other couple gets their food delivered.  5 minutes later, our food is delivered!   I find it odd that the other couple received their food before my wife and I. The quality of meat in my soup was questionable (color of the meat not what I have experienced before..almost a greenish color). The broth was decent though. My wife liked her pho, but mentioned that it was not as good as our other 2 preferred soup spots.  -1 for the smell -1 for playing favorites -1 for weird meat

I was looking for a place in East Mesa with good Pho- Tried ChopStix, and was not disappointed. Even though, they only have one type of Pho, they did it right. (I usually like the crazy Pho with tendons, ligaments, and pork blood..don't knock it till you've tried it).  My gf got sushi, which was surprisingly good. Will most def visit, and update my review once i have tried more-

I saw this place yesterday, while i was out running some errands. I was very intrigued. The idea was similar to Cheba Hut (which i am a huge fan of) So i just checked it out for lunch and was very disappointed. I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger with frys. The girl who took my order was very cute, but my burger was extremely salty. This alone "killed my trip". I may go back for a Shasta Cream soda someday. Hopefully the same girl who took my order is still there.

A good friend of mine swears by this place, so I have tried it out on 2 occasions now. This review combines the 2 experiences I have had here. First off, the atmosphere is drab. Maybe it's me.. and this may seem snobby to you, but the appearance and decor at a sushi joint really means a lot in my book. I love a sleek setting with the right lighting for sushi. It adds to the experience. Hon Machi looks dated. The odor when entering was not appetizing, and on the second visit during the day, I did notice some small flies inside the restaurant. On trip #1 (a Friday night), we sat at a table. The place was dead, but service was still very slow. The food wasn't terrible, but nowhere near what some of my preferred places do. Maybe they had an off night, so I gave it another shot here recently. Trip #2 sealed the deal for me. The rolls were all falling apart. Nothing seemed fresh. The owner even apologized to us for how bad the sushi was as she delivered it to us from the chef's station. Crazy right?. Flies, stank, slow service, and sub par sushi.. Truly a disappointment-

I saw this place out of the corner of my eye and stopped out of impulse for lunch. My girlfriend and I were seated at the bar. The scene is nothing special. It is quiet, and well lit..(unlike other commercial sushi spots). We ordered green tea to drink while scoping their menu. Do not get their green tea. It tasted like sea weed. Our server noticed that we weren't enjoying it, and took it off our bill later. We ordered a 3 roll deal which was 20 dollars, plus we got some tuna tanaka stuff which was 8 dollars. I was expecting crappy sushi because the tea sucked. Luckily, i was wrong. Every roll rocked my socks! Especially that tanaka (i think this is what it's called)..it's cutlets of seared, peppered tuna with some crazy sauce. The chef who made our sushi was very friendly, and made us a nice complimentary dessert. I have been back since, and my second experience was just as good. We tried all new rolls the second time, and neither me nor my gf were let down. Try it out. I have tried most sushi places in AZ, and this one Trumps the others. It's cheap too.

They lost me. I went in about 2 weeks ago with the family. We were seated, but no water or menus delivered for about 10 minutes though I saw 2 servers look at me. It was hot as balls out too, we were damn thirsty. Hot soup on a hot day you ask? Ya, we crazy like that. We had to get up and ask for water and menus! Then the wifey and I ordered.. soup and eggrolls. Soup came. No eggrolls. I was done but my wife made me try one more time a week later. On that last visit.. one lil baby piece of pork blood in my soup is what put me over the edge. C'mon you cheap phoks! My other spot's blood game on fleek. Skimpin on the product, and bad customer service is why I am done here. Peace blood.

I go here all the time because I have a bunch of friends who work in the kitchen. It's all good stuff.. I have tried most of the pastys. I love the Reuben, the Cajun, and the Royal (all horrible for you) I recommend swapping halves with a friend so you can try 2 types. Good beer selection.

I have visited Gallo Blanco probably 20 times. I cannot believe I never reviewed them.   First, I love the Clarendon Hotel. Everything about it. Colors, Art, Furniture, Pool, Roof-   The restaurant has provided me with a neat experience each time as well. I am such a fool for those little seafood tacos (halibut is my fav). The guacamole is the bizz.. as are their carne asada burritos.  I have ordered something new each time I have been, but make sure to have my dining partner try something I have been completely satisfied with previously. I usually find myself recommending to them whatever I had last time.   Gallo Blanco: i am so sorry I neglected you for so long. Please accept my 5 stars? i swear I am not just being nice..

Some of the best Pizza in AZ. I ordered the Funghi Pizza, and now it's all I can think about. "I wish I could quit you", Funghi Pizza..but I can't. Yum.. and 2.50 PBR! Effin A mane.. The architecture was tits..Our waiter was friendly, and made great recommendations. (see above) The price was right. Parking was abundant. I will be back to try more. You need to check this place out.. Btw., my friend got a pizza with sausage, and radicchio on it. His was ok. Go with a friend or 2 so that you can try more than one type of pie.

I am a little finicky with pizza. I don't think Venezia's can be beat (for Arizona pizza).. Since bitches are crazy, and make you move out of the house you practically built for them... I no longer have a Venezia's near me. I moved to Chandler with eyes scouting for what could be my new pizza joint. Fox's Den caught them quickly. I ordered a large 2 topping pizza with 10 hot wings for pick up on a Wednesday. My order was 10 bucks! Now.. this is not the best pizza ever, but it kills your major pizza chain any day. I highly recommend trying these guys.

Took my ipod in after breaking the screen.  Had the screen replaced, along with upgraded hard drive, new battery, and new front and back cases. It was cheap..I basically got a new ipod for $130.00. It took about a week for them to order parts though.

A friend and I heard this place played some good beats, so we made the trip. Holy cow! Was it awesome inside.. The decor was rad. Drinks were stiff, and affordable. people were weird, and entertaining. My flannel shirt and jeans stuck out like a sore thumb though. Next time I will dress like a vampire.

I heard great things about Hillside Spot from a friend. I will never consider his recommendations again.  The service was terrible.   Our waiter fucked everything up.. everything. Forgetful.. messed up each order. The family next to us had similar problems.. but worse. Waiter gave all the kid's food to another table. So the parents were already done eating when their kids finally received their grub.   The food was nothing special.. Maybe worth 2.5 stars. This Spot was boo boo. I've had better experiences at Waffle House.

I called in an order for pickup. 1 large 2 topping pizza. The total was 16 dollars and some change.. I thought ok, their large must be pretty big. Nope.. tiny ass pizza, like 14". Am I crazy here or is 16 bones for a 14" round piece of bread and cheese fucking insane? Never again-

Came in here with my kid, whom I suspected had an ear infection. His pediatrician was booked, so this was my option for antibiotics, if necessary. I sat for 2 hours before getting called back. For some reason, 2 patients who arrived after me were called back before me. Finally, we were called back into a small room. Vitals were taken, then we sat for 30 minutes before the Dr. Came in. She was looked in his ears and said, "Yep. Ear infection" and was basically out. A few minutes later a tech popped in to inform me that my insurance didn't cover the prescription I needed. Then I asked about the free prescription with Yelp Check In.. she hesitated then said, "Ok, ya." Then I sat for another half hour while they measured out the medicine. I thought they forgot about me. Keep in mind I have a 1 year old with tylenol wearing off this whole time.. I finally am told I can leave, and my meds are up front.. then the bitch up front wasn't told about the free prescription, so that's an argument. The tech comes to help, and they switch from English to Spanish while talking about me... I leave, and when I get home the medicine instructions read 2x a day for 10 days, but these idiots only gave me enough for 5 days. Ugh. Fuck this place.

-Wannabe In-n-Out- My burger was dry, and not very tasty. I can't figure out why this place was so packed. The next time I feel like dropping 8 bones on a burger, I will go to Delux. MMmmmm..Delux.

I was very impressed with this place.. David hooked up what is probably the best haircut I've had, complete with a straight razor line up. I saw that the yelp profile says they accept credit cards, but this is false information. I had to leave to withdraw some cash and come back to pay. Bel View Barbershop is my new spot. Great service for the right price. Parking is tricky though.

All in the rapper, E-40's voice:  Dopeness n shiat.. all wrapped up in a quaint little package. I ordered me a Thai Wrap after reading all the hype on this damned inter web, and that thang was the bizness. Had a n*gg* lickin peanut flavor off my phalanges for realz mane. Garlic rice make a thugg feel nice. Replaced that chicken with mothafunkin sauteed tofu and felt real good about myself afterward for not eating dead aminals. Too bad I'm making like 4 slabs of baby back ribs thizz weekend. Funk dem animals mane.. I be eatin them shits on the weekend only. Lots of em too.   My side salad came in a tiny ass condiment container! Aye, That's a Wrap!! Quit skiggety skimpin on dem portions mane.   Homie who took my order showed respek like a mugg... You wanna meet up fer lunch some time Yelpers?? Just Tell Me When To Go-  Hocus Pocus

My blurb to corporate today:  Ok.. I am a huge Jimmy Johns fan. I have been since you came to Arizona. I love the quality of the food. The speedy delivery.. the order online option.. everything. Today, while placing my order, a coworker talked about how you advertise speedy delivery, but always come up short. Me, never experiencing such misfortune.. said, "My delivery has never taken more than 15 minutes.. you must be on crack". I ordered, and then started my stopwatch 1 minute after clicking the final order button. (I ordered a tuna sandwich with avocado) I was so confident too, because last time, my sandwich came in just over 10 minutes!! So I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.. Ashamed. I hyped you up sooooo much! 29 minutes and 26 seconds later, your dude shows up!!! That is waaayyy too long. I could have walked across the street to JJ's, ordered, payed, returned and taken a 15 minute nap. I am a busy man JJ's.. A busy, hungry man. Here's the icing on the cake (or lack there of).. you chumps forgot the avocado!!! That was 75 cents! Gone! I am so mad at you. I feel like I just walked in on my wife getting freaky with Dwight Howard. Not cool-

I did not want to get all hyped up over the reviews about this place. All too often they will paint a picture in my head which just cannot live up to reality. This is something I am working on. I quickly perused the star ratings, and hurried out the door, excited for breakfast. My friend and I were politely greeted & seated. I saw the first item on the menu.. the "Mornin Monte" .. sold! I ordered it with my coffee, forcing my company to let go of his indecisiveness. He regretfully blurted out, "Errrr.. Ughh.. Combo: eggs, hashbrowns, french toast, fruit bowl" What a pussy! So that was it.. Seated, orders in, coffee cooling.. all within 3 minutes after parking.   So we sat. We listened to a group of elderly women discussing their kidney problems, admired the hickey just below our waitress' right ear. We smiled at a baby going crazy on a bowl of fruit with strawberries in it, and cringed over the girls next to us complaining about their struggles at the office. Actually, it was one girl griping, and the other sporadically inserting "yeah" here and there. (I thought: bitch, its Saturday.. chill out!)   We sat some more. Patiently. For about 45 minutes! The Golden Girls had gone.. leaving us with the 2 unhappy hipster chicks..   Finally! Our food!! The wait was ridiculous, so in order to get me back in there.. this Monte had to hit the spot. It didn't. Not even close. It's a french toast sandwich with egg white, turkey breast, turkey bacon, havarti, and some spicy marmalade. Honestly, minus the marmalade.. this thing was bland as fuck. The french toast egg mixture could use sprucing up. Maybe throw some fresh herbs into the egg white too? I dunno. It wasn't impressive in my opinion at all. Daniel's eggs and hashbrowns were eggs and hashbrowns. He agreed the french toast was wack... and those strawberries the little girl was macking on.. the ones that made him say, "Fruit Bowl!".. ya, those were nowhere to be found. In fact, there were only grapes in there. Weird right?   Service was great. The big guy who took my money at the end was very cool. I just don't like waiting 45-50 minutes for ho hum food.. Sorry Yoli's, you were a disappointment.

Yuck. This was the worst pho I have ever had. Bad broth, ugly meat, wilted veggies. Service was awful. The dude up front was coughing violently, and blowing his nose. Go to Khai Hoan. I feel sick right now and may have food poisoning-  -Update I definitely got food poisoning from Pho All Seasons-

First off, the coffee was amazing. I am not into all the fufu caramel mocha whatever drinks with whipped cream on top. I am a straight up americano or latte kind of guy. (just realized how lame that sounds, but it's the truth). I got an iced latte on my first visit to see what SoZo is about. Yum. This is what coffee is supposed to taste like in my opinion.  The service was excellent. A friendly woman took my order. She was super polite, and outgoing.   The shop itself was average to me, and there were long gaps between songs so the conversation I was having with a friend became awkward at times. You know when you are talking loudly because there is music on.. then the music stops, and it is dead quiet, so you have to wait for another song to start before you continue you conversation? Ya, that sucks.. For that alone, I subtracted one star.

Parentals brought yer boy here for bday #29. The wifey and I were early so we sat at the bar. I ordered a Manhattan. That ish was turnt to eleven. Bartender made us feel special. Sparks were flying on the conversational tip and literally as well. There was fire involved with the assembly of my drink. Fire is dope. Ma n Pah arrived so we moved from the bar to our table. The ambiance was sessy in the dining areas. Dim. Candles. Music. Booze. If you are trying to get under some garments then I recommend bringing your date here. Our waiter danced through the menu for us.. highlighting all his favorite items. Dude was like the Fred Astaire of wait staff. His charm worked too cuz my party ordered like everything off the menu. Pork belly. Fondue. Mac n cheese to start. I recommend you not order both the mac n cheese plus fondue because they use the same cheese for both. Good shit none the less. Belly was ill too. Dem brussel sprouts on the belly had me smiling.. the 16 year scotch which I transitioned to probably loosened that grin a bit too. Yum. Mom got ribs. Wife got chicken. Dad got meatloaf. Birthday boy (muah) got the duck. I tried each dish. All were spectacular. The chicken stood out though.. and usually I'm like: fuck ordering chicken at a nice(r) establishment. I remember thinking, "For reals boo? Chicken breast?" But oooh weee was I wrong. Delicious. Bread pudding was sweet to start then finished spicy as a damn Puerto Rican. What a great time!

Last week was a week from hell, customer service wise.. Today's experience with Sekong By Night has reminded me that there are genuinely good business owners out there.   My second visit was great. I called ahead to order. The owner told me my food would be ready in 15. When I arrived he was standing up front, holding my food. I paid, and joked with him on how he was so quick to rebuttal the bad yelp reviews. He laughed, and said that he just wanted his customers/potential customers to know both sides of the story. I like that-  My food was excellent. Beef noodle soup is what I usually order from my top pho joints.. Sekong's is on par with them. I do notice slight differences between Sekong's soup, and pho. Sekong's toasted garlic gave their broth a delicious flavor. My spring roll was also delicious. My only complaint would be the sauce choice for the spring rolls. This is just personal preference though. Don't get me wrong, I like the sauce Sekong provided, but I love the hoisen/peanut sauce most Viet places serve up. Not knocking Cambodian tradition or anything :)  Note- Last time I got the soup with all the guts in it.. I wasn't a huge fan. Maybe someday I will acquire a taste for it. The intestines were a little.. ahem.. ripe. Rightfully so, I mean, doo doo has touched those pieces of membrane in your bowl at some point.. pretty regularly too considering how the digestive system works. Usually I am into all the tripe, and tendons..even gelatinous pig blood at my spot in Tempe.. Shit, throw a knee cap in there too. Intestines just aren't for me right now. I am glad I had the guts to try it though

Wow! This place was awful. Subs were not terrible, but not in any way great. You walk in, and all the employees (who could be considered the only "special" part of this experience) scream something at you. Then a lesbian greets you, and teaches you how to read a menu, and place an order. You wait 15 minutes, and one of the tards..err, I mean employees brings you your food. I honestly don't even remember what I ordered, that's how mundane the food is here. Their "famous lemonade" tastes like someone put a bunch of wet naps into a bowl of water, sipped it, realized it was nasty as hell..then put 8 lbs of sugar and food coloring into it. Every time I drive by, I visualize the place engulfed in flames. Fitting-

As I waited for my to go order to be prepared, I noticed an older man struggle through the door with his walker. He parked his walker near the beverage station, and maneuvered slowly to a seat. As he sat down, the girl who had taken my order was already en route to his area with a large iced tea and 2 sweet n low packets. They obviously had some unspoken arrangement. She knew what he wanted, and delivered it promptly with a big smile on her face. I couldn't help but feel at home, and comfy. I have been told before that I am super insensitive.. and this made me feel really good inside.   Enough with the sappiness-  I think I missed the part about there being 4 patties on my burger.. this thing was a monster. I feel super guilty for eating the entire thing. I may even go to church this Sunday to ask for forgiveness. Ok maybe not, but you get the picture. Church is dumb.   My only gripe would be the done-ness of my beef. Next time I will ask for medium cooked patties. This, of course is a personal preference. All the flavors were on point. Bacon, Pastrami, Cheese, Onions, and Pineapple!?!?!?!!!! Jesus Christ!! Holy Shit! With 4 patties! Da Shack be holdin it down for realzzzz.  I didn't even get to my chili cheese fries. Honestly, after eating that burger (in it's entirety) I can't even look at them. They are on my desk at work right now. I may hide them in another employee's work area because he put a tampon in my protein shake container a couple weeks ago.. Perhaps rested above his cube on a ceiling tile? We will see.  The young lady who took my order was a sweetheart. Food was redonk. My iced coffee tasted spectacular, and got me dread-shakin-hyphy.. Prices were more than reasonable.. in fact, they could probably be raised. My department head was like, "Aye Ricktastic.. what did that meal cost you? 20 bucks?" -"naw mane.. dat shit was like $10.50 on da serious tip"  He doesn't really call me Ricktastic, but I wish he would-

Man.. Tsing Tao is garbage. You people are so quick to throw 4 or 5 stars around. I just bought a home in the area, and needed something quick and easy to grub on while I unpacked. Not in the mood for pizza, so I grabbed a flyer from my door and dialed Tsing Tao.  I ordered 2 types of Chow Mein, Tangerine Chicken, Rice, and Egg Rolls. My order came out to 30 bones. The delivery was on time, but whoever packed my order did not include chopsticks, forks, or napkins!! I called back, and mentioned to the owner that the reason for ordering out was because I hadn't unpacked any kitchen stuff.. and had no clue where the box with silverware was. He told me that to save money, Tsing Tao assumed that all houses had their own utensils!! What the fuck!!!? Chopsticks and napkins cost almost nothing you cheap bastard. I have never had my Chinese orders come without these simple things.  We ate our food with fucking steak knives until my chick came home from work (I asked her to grab some plastic forks on the way)  The food was downright terrible. No flavor.. All the meats were overcooked. MSG city.. Egg Rolls were raw inside. All 3 of us agreed that Tsing Tao was some of the worst Chinese we had ever experienced. I dunno if it was because I had just eaten really good Chinese the day before (Desert Jade) or what.. but fucking yuk! I will never give these cheap bastards my business again. All you fuckers on here need to explore a little bit more, because nothing that I tasted was worth 2 stars. For realz mane.. try Desert Jade, then go back and tell me Tsing Tao is worth more than 2 stars-  PS.. the fortunes in their cookies were garbage too.

Man o Man.. these guys make a great pie. Their crust is incredible. Chewy, and delicious. Their sauce is unmatched. So flavorful, and fresh.. and the quality of Big Boy's cheese seals the deal. I was reluctant to give some new joint "Top Pie" over Venezias.. but I think Big Boys may have it.   Prices and service cannot be beat here. Their staff is extremely friendly, and helpful.   You can get ice cream with your order too!!!  Wings here are tits.. so are garlic knots. I have no complaints. None!!

I am sad to revise negatively, but I just cannot believe my last experience with Big Boys. Let's see.. we ordered pizza at 12:30 pm on Wednesday. Big Boys said the pizza would be delivered in 45 minutes. An hour and a half later I called to see what was up because our pizza still had not arrived. The woman didn't have a reason, but offered a free 2 liter! Um no thanks, we already had 2 on the way with our original order. I asked if she would throw in some garlic knots, and she agreed. Almost another hour later and still no pizza! I called again, and the lady said it should be at my house in 7 minutes.. she gave me a few bucks off. Whatever. The pizza finally arrived, but with only one bottle of soda instead of the 2 we had ordered. The delivery guy tried to say he was taking money off.. and put $23.00 in the tip section of the receipt. This seemed shiesty to me so I made sure to scribble it out. I always always always talked these guys up, but now I will just go back to Venezias. Bummer, cuz the pizza is great. It's just too bad the other employees outside the kitchen can't seem to get it together.

When I was a kid, maybe 6 or 7, my mother took me to a neighbor's home to pick out a kitten as my new pet. One of the kitties was born terribly deformed. Her back was abnormally arched, and bulged out. She couldn't walk, and my mom told me that poor kitty probably wouldn't survive for very long. I knew instantly this was the kitty I had to take home. If it was the last thing I did, it was going to be making sure she had best possible life I could provide for her until that sad, inevitable day arrived.   I named her Jennifer. She and I were inseparable! I would run home from school everyday, ecstatic, and eager to see my beloved pet.  As she got a little older, she started to walk a little bit. I would lay down on the floor to watch tv, and she would climb up onto my chest, and sleep there. Everything I did involved little Jennifer. She was my best friend.   As she grew, the strain on her back became more and more stressed. Suddenly, she couldn't walk anymore. No more climbing up to cuddle with me. Finally after a couple of weeks, I got home from school, and ran to her little bed... but no Jennifer. My parents called me into the kitchen to explain that Jennifer had died while I was at school. They told me she was in a lot of pain, but that the pain was over, and that she was now in kitty heaven.  I was devastated. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I couldn't watch tv because it reminded me of little Jennifer. My sunshine kitty. All I could do was cry. I cried every night for a week straight. Eventually, I came to terms with her death, but needless to say, it was a very sad time in my life. I did learn a good life lesson though.  The Tikka Masala I ordered from Spice It Up was almost as sad. Save your money. Save your time. If you must eat from this food truck, I would recommend you adopt a deformed, dying kitty cat first.. because when it passes on to kitty heaven, you might then be able to forget about spending $11 dollars on complete rubbish.

Shit was good, but kinda pricey. 14 bucks for 10 wings, Kool-aid, and fried Okra. For 14 bones, I can quench the thirst of a decent sized village in Africa with Kool-Aid. Employees were very cool, and made suggestions, which I love. I got good vibes from ATL Wings, and will be back-

Wow. Been going to Barros for 15 years and never again. Wife and I walked in for lunch, each carrying a baby. We asked an employee if we could get 2 high chairs. She then pointed to where those are kept, on the other side of the dining area. Umm thx. So with baby in hand, I went and grabbed one.. took it to my wife so that she could put a baby down.. then grabbed the other one, which was missing a strap. I felt it would have been great if the employee had helped me. Not very welcoming. I will buy pizza elsewhere from now on.

For real.. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh.. Cheese... Lettuce. Sour cream. Overall plain as fugg..   I decided to give them another try, cuz I was craving some damn menudo, and no place has menudo during the week. Me and my coworker Fernando hit up the FBH at 11am. I ordered menudo.. Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, "skuse me..deyyzz supposed ta be sep-rit oah-duz."  the clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!¬≠"  The shit was disrespectful as hell.  Whatever.. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle.. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre-made soup.. pour it into a styrofoam container.. put a lid on it.. put it in a brown bag.. toss a pre-made baggie of onion and cilantro in.. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread.. toss that shit in the bag.. and shout out a nigga name.  Nah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes!!! Then I took that shit out of the bag! "WTF is this???" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH.. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here-

Pho Viet Nom Nom Nom  Pho - Nam - ENAL  1 Star for the BROTH. Broth quality comes first when rating Pho in my opinion. Pho Viet Nam nails it. A perfect balance of Sweet, Roasted, and Savory, meat + veggie flavors at the same time in my mouth. It's like an orgy going on in there. A lesbian Suicide Girl orgy.   1 Star for opening up at 10am. Pho for breakfast anyone?? I think so. Rough night drinkin? Well you are in luck. Hot soup at 10 am is the shit, and will turn your hangover into that ceremony in Atlantis a short ways into Little Mermaid.. Except Ariel is present for this shin dig.. clam shells and all.  2 Stars go out to the owner who has made it a point to chat it up with me each time I have visited. Shout out to the guy who runs this tight ship for being friendly, and for keeping the place clean.  1 Star for VALUE.. These guys do not skimp on anything. My soup comes packed with meat, and noodles.. Every.Time. Even the herbs, veggies, and sauces you get are fresh, and abundant. Put all that shit in some orgasmic (tattoos.. piercings.. purple hair) broth and BOOM! You've got a 5 star Pho joint-

I have probably been to 40+ Vietnamese restaurants in search of the ultimate bowl of soup. As far as the pho goes.. Spring Roll Factory landed right in the middle of the pack. I've had better. I've also had much worse. The menu here is a little dumbed down, and includes the basic Viet menu items which will appeal to the majority. The most important contributing factor in my own personal Pho Scoring system is the broth. This is where SRF excelled. The broth (beef pho) was mildly sweetened by anise, and charred ginger flavors. Then salty, and rich. Maybe a tad on the salty side.. but still very good. I prefer to spruce up my soup with salt and heat as necessary. Other contents of the soup were typical, minus the meatballs, which I would say were above average. Very flavorful. I would like for my sliced meat however, to be sliced thinner, and rare. I did have an issue with the spring rolls as well. I would love for them to include more basil, or cilantro, as they were on the bland side.. mainly consisting of shredded iceberg lettuce and cucumber. The complimentary egg rolls which I hear are gifted on your first visit made up for this though.. Get some of them!  The service was the best part of my experience here. Don't get me wrong! I enjoyed my meal.. but the woman (pretty sure the owner) who greeted me when I came in totally won me over as a customer. She was personable, and sincere. She seemed to be very happy, and explained to me some of their food preparation processes. She  really put out some good vibes, and this is why I gave 5 stars. For me, my experience with service at a restaurant weighs just as heavy as the food experience.  Spring Roll Factory is a new restaurant in a great area. They offer quality food at a reasonable price, with fantastic service. I am sure anyone else would say the same-

I work near Grinders, so Yelp on my phone would pull them up each time I searched for lunch. 5 stars huh? Most of the stars came from first time reviewers, so I have been putting off my visit. I have experienced first hand, people opening a restaurant.. then having their friends start a Yelp account in order to rate high and jump start the business. Whatever. That pastrami pic captivated me. So I went in.   1. I walked in and heard Katy Perry's Dark Horse playing inside. I almost turned around then. Katy Perry is the devil..   2. The inside appearance of the place is rough. Apparently a work in progress. (I might add that is was clean.. just un-finished, cosmetically)   3. No AC.. a bit warm inside. (I don't know if this space was purchased, or being leased.. but this needs to be taken care of either way.. like now)  Ok. 3 strikes and you are out right? Nope. I was greeted by a friendly man, and asked what I might be in the mood for. This made up for Katy Perry. I asked him to make me whatever he liked. He recommended the Club. Even though pastrami is what brought me in.. a club was sounding good too.   Watching dude make my sandwich made up for the inside appearance and warmth. He meticulously built an outstanding sandwich for me. Oil on the bread. Perfectly folded meat. Even condiments, and veggies. This sandwich was the most consistent sub I've had. Every bite was the same. Every bite was delicious. The ingredients were all fresh. From the meats and cheese sliced in house, to the crisp lettuce, and perfectly ripened tomatoes.   I asked if that man was the owner, and he told me he was. We chatted a little bit, and what he told me gave me the feeling that he had been sick of working for other people, and had to do his own thing. Props for making that move, and opening your shop. You've got quality food. The service is there. Lesson learned: Don't judge a book by it's cover.

Heard a lot of hype on this joint so I finally did the damn thang and went for lunch. I knew I would have to wait an hour. I knew I would be paying top dollar. I also knew there was no way Little Miss BBQ would live up to my expectations. Welp.. I was wrong about one of those things for sure. LMB exceeded what I had dreamt up in my head. Dude servin meat pulled out a brand new brisket just as I made it to him.. and that thing looked like it was twerkin on the table. He cut into it, and everyone behind me sounded like they were watchin fireworks. "Ooohhhs!" and "Ahhhhhs!" One guy behind me said, "Oh my f#ck#ng god, I can't wait!"   I got the brisket, sausage, beans, and grits with peppers, onions n bread. It all blew me away. Best BBQ I ever had. Go there. Anything you order will be worth the wait and the money.

Salazar Bros food comes faster and fresher than the competition up the street. They are also more friendly. I have only had carne asada burritos,  quesadillas, and enchiladas so far and all were delicious. The meat was tender.. and the beans were magical ;) oh ya and the sauce is titties. Get drunk and try this shit out b

I had a pretty good time here. Our waitress was really boobs and the musicians were entertaining. Drinks were on the expensive side, and had little booze in them, so I would recommend beer. Seriously.. I watched the bartender hook up the weakest damn pour into the smallest cup full of ice EVER!!! It was like a little half second squirt lol.

What's brackin blood!? I am tacking on another star. The last 2 pies I ordered here were brispy, and loaded with toppings. Maybe they saw my last review or something.
