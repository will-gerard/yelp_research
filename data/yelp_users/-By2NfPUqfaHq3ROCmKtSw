This company's contract is very frustrating to work with. I signed a 60 month (5Year) contract and in their fine print, if you don't notify them within 90 days of the end of the 60 month contract, they automatically re-sign you for another 60 months.  I have used them for 8 years but they still want more money out of me.  I pay $71.28 for a cassette tape player. I can not speak directly with my sales rep, at least she is willing to send me an email. I did get her name from someone on the 800 number I was directed to call if I had questions about the "nominal rate increase"...again. I am still working on canceling service.

They are great! They do preliminary questions to make sure that you aren't wasting your time (or theirs). They stand up for you and do what is right for you. Can't say enough positive comments on how they handled my case. They are responsive to emails and follow up. They only take legitimate cases and don't subscribe to "frivolous" lawsuits.

Audrey and Rachel are wonderful! I have had many massage therapists and they are top notch. I love that a 60 minute massage is a 60 minute massage - not 5 minutes to change and 10 minutes on the back of the massage to get up and dressed which leaves only 45 minutes of actual massage. They are great at finding and addressing all of your "problem" areas and do so without the recovery downtime if you have been incorrectly worked over.

Terry Minich lead the charge through all the paperwork that is required for a refinance. The rules changed since the last time I refinanced my home and Terry was there to make sure it went smoothly. Terry was responsive to my questions and went above and beyond with his follow up and paper chase. Thank you for all of your persistence to ensure the refinance went through before the rate lock expired!

Very responsive. Love that they take a picture of the pool and attach to an email with the chemical balance. Would recommend them without hesitation!
