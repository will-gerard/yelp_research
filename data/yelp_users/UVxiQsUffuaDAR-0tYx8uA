Dr. KONKLE is not only a great dentist, but a HERO  to me!   Interesting story....  One day I was parked at a red light, then my car was suddenly struck from behind, by a truck. Dr. KONKLE happened to witness it & followed the truck, to get his license plate pic for me, since he saw the guilty driver take off (hit & run). He did this even though he had his young kids in the car & a pool party to get to.   I know this has nothing to do with dentistry, but everything to do with what a great human being  Dr. KONKLE is in my eyes!!! I am very grateful, as I recently got my car out of the shop & didnt have health insurance, as I'm a new graduate & self employed.  This made a Big Difference in my life financially, and to know we have Earth Angels like Dr. KONKLE watching out for people like me, filled my heart. Thank You Ever So Much Dr. KONKLE, for going out of your way to "right a wrong & help a stranger"!  Sincerely, Ronna

Their Return Policy Sucks! I figured a big box store would be more flexible. I tried to return a $30 Baby Toy, as I didn't get to go to the shower, and they ONLY OFFERED ME $2.00 BACK!!! :((( You only have 14 days people, & Zero on Clearance Items, no matter how expensive.

I am disappointed  in this location, and or the franchises price & portion. I ordered the Create your own salad, (5 topping, including chicken) there was like 5 tiny tiny bites of chicken (which normall y is a add on for a $1.79. How do they justify (1-2 ounces of meat as an addon. It's barely a sprinkle) ... I asked them to give me a reasonable portion (they gave me attitude & another 1 Oz (Jello shot size amount). Rrrrrrrrr!
