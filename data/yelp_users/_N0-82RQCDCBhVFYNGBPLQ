The ladies at A Touch of Class are AMAZING! I have a Weaton/Bejon mix named Taz who is very difficult to groom, she likes to wiggle. Pets Mart and PetCo have both told me never to bring her back.  The ladies are incredibly nice and friendly, they are kind with Taz, you can tell they are true animal lovers! They are the only groomers who are patient enough to wash and groom my dog! We have not been in for a while because Taz has developed allergies which i hear is not uncommon for Weatons, but as soon as she is better we will definitely be back!!

I LOVE this store! PLRG has an amazing jean selection! It is decorated well and does not smell like a traditional consignment store! If you do not find what you like at one store, you can cruise to their other store a few miles away! The FaceBook page is amazing as well and updated daily with new clothes, shoes, purses and jewelry. I make the trip to both stores and add Last Chance as a stop in between for a successful shopping day :)

Amazing staff! These guys are as good as it gets! Dr. Peterson and his staff are sensitive to my aches and pains that seem to change everyday. Every once in a wail i confuse my appointment times, Dr. Peterson and his staff are quick to make arrangements and squeeze me in.  I look forward to my visits and feel like i am in good hands!

This is our favorite restaurant, we usually eat here once a week. Service and food are always amazing. We never have any issues or problems! Management always stops by our table to see how everything was! Sometimes the chicken fried rice is spicier then other times and i am a wussy when it comes to spice, but it does not stop us from going!

Great breakfast! We frequent TC Eggingtons and the quality of food was right up there! I ordered the biscuits and gravy with bacon eggs and potatoes. The bacon was thick, the eggs were cooked to order and I absolutely love homemade potatoes!! My boyfriend had an omelet he said it was good, but the presentation of the plate could have been better. Service was great! We will definitely be back!

We had a disappointing evening on our wives night out. Sangria tasted like diluted wine vs. wine punch. When we asked to exchange the drinks for something else, the manager on duty rudely greeted our table demanding to know what was wrong with our, "TERRIBLE" drinks. Sadly, replacement margaritas were not any better. We started off with the bruschetta trio and were unable to distinguish the different types apart. They all looked and tasted same!!!  We knew we had already upset the staff with our drink fiasco, so we decided to let this slide and hoped that dinner would save the evening. Dinner was good, but our waitress was nowhere to be found for drink refills, or to pay our bill.  We had to flag someone down for both. We tipped her over 20% and left.

Stopped in on a Friday after work, asked to see a drink menu and ordered a bud light lime. The waitress came back and apologized she did not have any. I looked at the menu again and ordered some sort of cider. The waitress returned and informed me that they do not have that beer either. I ended up ordering a bud light bottle which was skunky.    We had a few friends join us, one ordered a scotch and soda, when he asked what kind of scotch they had, the bartender held up a bottle of Jim Beam!?!? He then asked for Brady and was told they did not have any and ended up settling on a beer.  Needless to say....we won't be coming back :)
