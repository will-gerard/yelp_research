This restaurant is hard to find, but I would say worth the search for health conscious patrons.  Reasonably priced health-centric alternative to the numerous beffets.

Great service...sometimes a little slower than would be expected but you won't otherwise be disappointed with it.  Late check-out is 4pm!!  This place does "walk-the-walk" when it comes to Trump's gospel.  The rooms are well appointed.  There is a decent restaurant option on-site, a good spa, and a great benefit, in my opinion, of not having a casino on the ground floor. Also you are located close to fashion show mall, which can be convenient for various reasons.  Speaking of location this is located at the North end of the strip, but if you're in Vegas you're going to do your share of walking anyway.  There is a frequent shuttle to Ceasar's, so you can start your journey from there.  When I go back this will be in my list of top options of places to stay.

Worst experience ever. Veggie pizza was so-so, staff worked like the non-funny version of The Three Stooges (insert your favorite stooge sound effect here). Waited 30 min for the check, after asking three times. Manager kept pulling her cell out of her cleavage and checking it. Wait staff cursing. They couldn't handle the flow so they closed up (as in closed the security gate) with patrons inside. It was cray...

We've been to Sedona a couple times and had Grand Canyon tours on each visit.  While both were good, I have to say that this one is top notch.  The guide that we had (Dwayne) was very knowledgeable, very personable, and knew all of the right spots to make this trip unforgettable on our private tour.  The rates are reasonable, and the tour vans are very comfortable.  For meals, they use one of my favorite local locations - Wildflower Bread Co. They will also pick you up from your lodging location in Sedona or Phoenix area.  The tour is very accommodating for folks with motion sickness issues, etc.  I couldn't recommend these folks any more highly.
