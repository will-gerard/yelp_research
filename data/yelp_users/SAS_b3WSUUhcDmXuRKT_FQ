Called on Wednesday to inquire about color,  was told pricing and asked for an appointment on Saturday was told Saturdays are walk in only.  Come in Saturday morning when they open was told I can't get color for 48 hours as they have to do a patch test... why in the heck didn't the person on the phone tell me that?? Totally wasted time and gas for something that would have been super easy to communicate.

Awful food, nothing was even "good". Potato salad on the salad bar tasted rancid, sweet and sour sauce tasted like heated cherry koolaid. Chicken for sweet and sour chicken was dry and tough. Spring rolls had horrible flavor and were very greasy. Paid $58 for a family of 5 huge huge waste of money.

Took my 10yr old daughter with me to get gel polish while I got a fill and gel polish. They charged me $25 for my daughters nails which is absurd they didn't do a mani just gel polish and a little flower.  I've never paid more than $15 for her nails anywhere in the west valley.  My fill was marginal,  my cuticles are very sore and torn up. The place is clean,  but I don't think I'll be going back.
