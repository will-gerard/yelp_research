I like it here...quick  food, good prices, yummy.  Be prepared for the line at lunch!  It moves fast though...just know what you want to order when you get there...otherwise, you might get trampled by the stampede!  Patio is fantastic!

Great experience here! Opened an account a couple of weeks ago. Very good customer service. Everyone greeted us with a smile and we were helped quickly. We went in on a Saturday--all branches are open on Sats 9-1, which is very convenient. We opened a few accounts and applied for a loan. A few days later, the account manager called to tell us the loan was approved. Easy.   So many credit unions and banks tell you they have free checking and then put conditions on you getting it free. Here--there are no conditions. It's just free. Their other fees and rates are comparable and in many cases better than other credit unions in the valley including Arizona Federal and Desert Schools. They have a drive through location at this location. They've also recently added e-banking and online bill pay. They don't have mobile deposit yet.  We switched from Arizona Federal Credit Union. Two years ago, AZ Federal started charging membership fees which I can only describe as very un-credit-union-like. What's worse is that they spend $ on ridiculous tchotchkes and promotions. I am not interested in paying more fees so I can have a pencil or a chip clip or a iPhone stand with the bank's name on it!!! I'm interested in banks lowering my fees, expanding hours, making e-banking easier, and giving me a decent rate. That is what SunWest is obviously spending their money on.  We were not given any cheap plastic crap for becoming members and they just put our account info in an envelope...not a fancy color folder that requires expensive printing services. I really appreciate that--they aren't wasting money on things that don't matter.  Overall, it's been an excellent experience so far. I highly recommend them.

I was initially skeptical about this place...my coworker told me about it and orders lunch from here 1-2x/wk.  She likes more plain food than I do, so I assumed it was going to be plain.  I was pleasantly surprised for two reasons...everything can be made vegetarian and anything I don't want can be substituted for something else...so it's a bit like "design-your-own-wrap"....  For sure, the Ken and BarbieQ is my favorite, sub tofu and brown rice...corn, rice, blk beans, veggies, and bbq sauce...DELISH!  This place is great for staff lunches...seems like there's something on the menu for everyone.  But beware, lunch time can be a bit difficult, especially parking-wise, because it's packed in here...so CALL ahead and order to go!

Awesome tortilleria and fun to watch with the kidlets.  Fresh salsas, frescas, bakery items, meats, and cheeses.  Restaurant/cafeteria inside is tasty and you can make your food exactly how you want it (bean and cactus burrito!!).  We go here at least once a week to grab our non-organic stuff...kiwis, papayas, mangos, etc. and the tortillas...because they are gigantic!  Our bill's never been over $40 for four big bags of produce!

Best kept secret on pet supplies in Phx.  Those hair combs that pull out your pet's extra fur...the furminator i think it's called...1/2 the price in here compared with the regular pet stores.  The staff is very helpful too if you're looking for a specific item!  They have a catalog you can look thru as well, which seemed to help me a lot as this place is a warehouse, not really a store!

Love it here!  Art classes like the mosaic one I took a few years back are great.  The night tours in the summer are really *the* only thing to do in Phoenix during the summer other than the pool!  Luminarias are also *the* thing to do in Phoenix in December!!  Most of the year (except for the dead of summer), the butterfly exhibit is open...a draw for all children and lepidopterists.  Definitely consider joining if you can.  $75 for two people and $100 if you want free rentals of the scooters every time you go...especially handy if you're recovering a debilitating injury!

I went looking for non-VOC paints.  When we walked in, I stood around looking perplexed for about a minute before one of the salespeople came over.  When he did, I informed him of what I was looking for.  He wanted to know whether I wanted eggshell, matte or gloss.  Having had an experience several years ago with some soy paint that washed off when I scrubbed it with vigor, I was unsure what gloss when he informed me that some cleaned better than others.  So, I asked what the ingredients were in their paint...curious whether it was that same soy stuff I'd used awhile back.....and so starts the drama.  He told me he didn't know. I asked him if he could find out. "I guess so" he says, obviously annoyed, and off he goes to print something out.  He brings it back. No info on the ingredients.  But it does tell me that their paint is NOT zero VOC because it does have a small amt of VOCs in it. (why is it labeled non-VOC???)  I tell him that there are still no ingredients on this and then he gets even more huffy and ask him again if he can give me the ingredients in it.  He's angry, but I ignore it and he goes off to print me the MSDS sheet for the paint.  Back he comes with totally useless information unless I plan to eat the paint and need to know whether I'm going to die.  BUT what the hell are the ingredients in the paint????  I point out that there's no info on that sheet either.  He's super pissed at this point.  I tell him to go away and get me someone else to help.  Over comes a young man who tells me that they do not know what the ingredients are but he's sure they are just fine and everything's ok.  LOL.  What am I...a sheep???  We leave.  Down the street there was a Sherwin-Williams.  I stopped in there hoping maybe I would have better luck.  They were wonderful.  Great customer service...very amiable.  When I asked what the ingredients were, they showed me the can...the ingredients are on the can!!  And, it was actually ZERO VOC and the pigments they add are also zero VOC.  To top it all off, there's a designer on staff to help with colors and design!  GO Sherwin Williams!  Don't waste your time at Dunn-Edwards.  Their customer service is at best spotty and uninformed...at worst, just plain old rude and ignorant!

I've been here twice...the first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer.  I'm a sucker for homemade root beer, so I had high hopes that this place would become a favorite.  My husband and I were so excited when these huge glasses of RB hit the table!!  And then confusion...both of us looked at each other and said "WTF???"  Worst RB EVER!  What the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass?  We looked all over the menu and found nothing.  Then we saw the "fine print" on a small table sign...STEVIA.  It's made with Stevia NOT sugar...I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is the lame-est root beer on the planet.  If I'm going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer, I want it to be delectable...sugar and all...no freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars (and yes, I know stevia is "natural" but who gives a crap...it tastes terrible anyway).  After the root beer debacle, it didn't get better.  The food was meh...service was not so great (there were moments of "is she ever coming back???").  I'd say, go here for the beer, sans root, but that's about it.  Otherwise, skip this place and drive out to Four Peaks...you'll be happier all around.

Gigantic menu...and kind of all over the place.  Everything from noodles to sushi, so it's a great place for the family because everyone can have something different.  Service is ok, but this place is swamped.  Food is very good...and the noodles authentic, so we'll definitely visit again!

I'm in love with their vegan pizza...soy sausage, BBQ sauce, and red onions, oh my! My only complaint is the crust...it's not great...sometimes I think it tastes like cardboard (that's why 4 stars and not 5). The toppings definitely make up for it though. I'm not sure what the crust is missing, but I wish it was better (or maybe not because then I'd be ordering pizza more often!!).  We have never been there in person--always gotten delivery. The delivery is fast...usually around 45 minutes. Once they forgot my soy sausage and the replacement pizza was here in 20 minutes. Great service!

The people here at this store are soooo helpful.  I needed new windshield wipers (like everyone does here in AZ right after monsoon season starts and you realize the hard bricks of rubber you've had on there since last year are not going to cut it!).  I don't know what was going on with me, but I was confused about what to buy and even how to put them on...the directions on the back were cryptic! The guy came outside to my car, showed me how to put them on and then did it for me. yea!  A few months before this happened, our battery was going dead and they helped me install a new one!!  I love these guys!  Excellent service!!!

Ridiculous place...there's just so much fabric to choose from that, if you're a fabric whore like myself, you could be in here for half the day.  I can't control myself around fabric...so those of you who belong to FLA (Fabric Lovers Anonymous) know I've broken down in here and bought fabric like five years ago that I still haven't used but promised I would find something to use it for someday or if not you can bury me with it.  ahem...anyway...great for cheap awesome finds.  much better than schlepping out to BFE to go to JoAnn's.  Gigantic rolls of fabrics and some hard to find items--like black out material for our curtains.  Ribbon selection is huge.  Staff can be kind of brusque but only because they're swamped with work, but they are helpful when it's your turn.  Would highly recommend it!!

About the only thing I can eat is the potatoes.  That said, I've tried other there while "cheating" like their omelettes.  I am not impressed.  How can anyone be impressed with processed cheese and greasy gobs of hash browns???  ick.  Next time, I'm lobbying for Waffle House.  Plus, the last time I was there, I was recovering from surgery and in a wheelchair.  The person at the front taking names and seating people was downright rude.  Yes, she was young and ignorant, but she still acted badly.

I don't run.  I go in here to buy shoes because they know their stuff and they don't hassle me when I say, "I need a neutral cushion shoe" or "My foot supinates."  This last time, we got there a few minutes after 5pm on a Sunday.  There were still people inside and the manager was nice enough to let me come in and buy some shoes even tho' they were closing up.  The staff is knowledgable about shoes and if you want someone who knows what they are doing to help you with your tennis (or running) shoes, this is the place to go!

This is only a review for Belinda, their waxer.  Best kept secret in Phx.  Oh she's so good.  Fantastic Brazilians, perfect brows.  I was referred here by a friend and pretty much, won't go anywhere else.  She is FAST and METICULOUS and that makes all the difference when it comes to waxing!

Wow.  What a really terrible experience.  We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my "legwork".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?  So, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.  Then to make matters even worse, he POINTED at our car and started LAUGHING with the cashier at the front.  Holy crap...really?  Laugh at the handicapped girl???  Wow...I don't even know what to say about this a$$ except that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back here.  The Ace on 24th st is just down the street and has nicer employees even tho' it is small.  And, Paul's Ace Hardware in Tempe is by far the BEST Ace in the valley...especially if you need screening.

Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.  Also, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back.

Got a lamp that you love?  Can figure out why the F*(K it doesn't work anymore??  Bring it in here.  They'll fix it...they'll be super helpful, won't cheat you, won't try to upsell you and won't charge you a fortune.  Perfect!!

I go here because it's close...but the store out in Chandler is so much bigger and friendlier.  The Geniuses here are alright, but seem to always have an attitude or be swamped.  Plus, the store itself is usually swamped...when I go in and need help, there's nary a person to help me.  Last time I waited 30 MINUTES to ask a question about a laptop.  Either I'm addicted to apples or just plain stupid because I would NEVER wait that long in any other store.  The lack of customer service, the wait times, and the general malaise of the staff here make me seriously consider not buying an apple again every time I visit this store.

Definitely try the Western burger!! Much better burger than even the Big Wac at Green...I know that's practically vegan sacrilege, but it's true! The Western is a bbq'd gardein patty topped with pineapple, fried onion rings, lettuce and mayo. Yum!  Our other favorite dish here is the Rainbow Salad. Like a vinegar slaw, but sweet and with peanuts and a veg meaty protein that tastes similar to ham imo. Delicious!  The fried shrimp, actually fried yam protein, is so amazing too...perfect texture and taste.  The milkshakes are very rich and either soy milk based or coconut milk based depending on the flavor. They have cakes and pies for dessert too but my favorite is a slice of the raw vegan cheesecake!

They RECYCLE batteries here!!!!!!  Yes, single use batteries!!!!!  Plus, they'll take your used electronics and recycle them to Strut and Westech.  Other than that amazing and awesome convenience, their batteries are CHEAPER than Walmart and better quality than the big brands (like Energizer).  Plus, the guys who work here are super helpful!  Highly recommend this place!!!!!

I've been going to Baker for about 8 yrs now. I like the nursery...they have a very good selection of succulents, starts (veggies, herbs), and a decent selection of trees, vines and desert-adapted plants. I wouldn't recommend them if you are looking for natives however because the selection is small.  Over the years I've bought a lot of plants and trees here...and I've only had a few die...most recently, 4 out of 5 pedilanthus I bought (lady slipper plant) died almost immediately after bringing them home. When I went in to Baker to talk with them about it, they were unapologetic, unhelpful, and rude. They said they don't guarantee their plants at all...it was my fault completely and I killed them. I was upset, yes, but I kept going back and resigned myself to having just lost about $100. It is after all, a local nursery close to my home and maybe I did do something wrong...I'm not perfect.  We started getting serious about landscaping our yard a year ago, and I wanted more natives and desert plants. Since Baker didn't have them in stock, I requested them by writing down the item and giving it to the cashier who then would give it to the person who orders plants. I did that three times over about 3 months. No response. I tried to call...sometimes they don't answer the phone. I stopped by. No one ever responded to my requests.  So I finally went to other nurseries around the valley to find natives. It was then that I realized what I'd been missing at Baker--good customer service with a smile. Baker's staff seem disgruntled or crusty most of the time--even the 20-somethings that work there never have a smile to greet you.  The last straw: I've been asking around at all the nurseries for a certain plant called Rabbitbush. It's a Chihuahuan desert native related to our Sonorant desert's turpentine bush. I want several for my yard and I can't find them anywhere in Phx (most nurseries are supplied with desert plants through a wholesale company called Mountain States and I knew already that they didn't have it in their inventory.) I'm not an expert at plants, but I did my research on this bush and I knew what I wanted. I went to Baker about a week ago to get some succulents and while I was there, I asked about Rabbitbush. They didn't have it in stock of course but I could leave a note for Joy, the gal who orders plants. I thought, "yeah, right, no one will call me back", but urged by the salesperson who said they sometimes order plants from Civano in Tucson, I wrote out the request: "5 Rabbitbush, Ericameria nauseosa var. nauseosa" and left it with no expectation of hearing back.  I got a call a few days later saying they got it them in. Thinking that was too quick, I called back several times and finally they picked up. I was transferred to Joy. I asked her what she had ordered and she told me Ericameria nauseosa. Yeah, but which one, I asked. The one you requested she replied. I asked her about the exact botanical name, at which point she got annoyed and told me again she'd gotten what I requested. I tried to ask whether it was the subspecies nauseosa or speciosa but she told me that Mountain States shortens the names on the sticker (shouldn't she have asked whether it was the right plant prior to buying it or calling me?). Sensing this was about to be a repeat of the Pedilanthus conversation where I was the one that was at fault for daring to question the all-knowing Baker staff, I quit trying to explain it and asked, "does it say Whitestem chamisa on the bucket?" "Yes." I told her there was a difference between chamisa and Rabbitbush in the subspecies name, but she just said "do you want them or not?" No thanks was my reply and we hung up.  Yes, maybe I'm just a customer and maybe I haven't worked at a nursery, but I know what I'm talking about on that one. I will probably go back to Baker at some point and I think it's a good nursery for Phx folks to check out at least once. But, if you go, set your expectations low: 1. Expect to be treated poorly. Don't expect them to be nice to you or give you any respect, even if for one moment you know more about a plant than they do. 2. Buyer beware: if a plant dies, it's your fault, not theirs and don't ask them about it because you will be told that you killed the plant in a rude tone of voice. 3. Help yourself. Don't expect them to go out of their way to help you. (We have a hard time getting anyone to help us get our plants to the register.) With low expectations, if anything goes right for you at Baker, you'll think it's great.

WORST THAI we've ever had. Greasy, gross, packaged mix flavors. And not Thai--it's bad Chinese food pretending to be Thai food.  Here's what we ordered: 1) Mii Krobb (me grob as it's called at other Thai restaurants). This sticky yumminess is supposed to be created in a wok and the sauce cooked *with* the noodles. The crap they gave us was a bunch of short, pre-made crunchy rice noodles with red-dye #40 sweet/sour sauce DRIZZLED on it. Seriously????? Gross. We took one bite and no more.   2) Phaht Thai (pad Thai at other Thai places): so gross we didn't finish it! Very greasy and tasted like the sauce was made from a packaged mix.  3) Sweet n Sour Tofu: the tofu was disgusting--it's fried first, then dipped in batter and fried again. I took one bite and didn't eat any more. Massively greasy blob of gross. Sauce says it's homemade on the menu but it looks nuclear red and tastes packaged.  4) Spicy Thai rice: again--über greasy and also not flavorful.  We will never go back.

I found out about this place through a groupon...it was out of the way for me, but I keep driving back up there to get plants, so perhaps it's not too far to drive for good plants and good customer service. They're always willing to help me get my plants up to the register or help me find plants I can't find.   Large selection of Mexican designed pots...not sure what else to call those kind of pots. They have a few citrus trees but mostly their selection is natives and succulents and cacti.  Highly recommend the place for good plants, good prices, great coupons and helpful staff!

We went here for the goofy golf one night. I thought it was ok...but my kid thought it was the best place he'd ever been. I remember goofy golf being that way when I was a kid too. He asks to go back every couple of weeks!  The four courses are divided into two areas and honestly, we found it difficult to navigate and distinguish between the two courses...they need better signs. Besides that, there was almost no one there. We saw three young couples in the 1.5 hrs we spent on the course. It was a weeknight in February after dark.   Be aware that if you have any physical limitations, you'll be walking a lot on these courses and there are lots of steps...it's not handicapped accessible!!

Everytime we're even near the I-10 and Chandler Blvd, we stop here and get sandwiches.  Why?  VEGGIE MEATS!!!!  They have veggie turkey, veggie hamburger and even veggie chicken.  There's nowhere else (that I know of in Phx) that you can get a deli sub made with veggie meats...especially this kind of quality.  We always order the largest size:  a whopping 20 inches, which we can usually get 2-3 meals out of.  And of course their signature subs:  the "Bobbie" (w/cranberry sauce, stuffing, and turkey) and the "Cole Turkey" (w/cheese, turkey, and cole slaw) make this the ultimate veggie sandwich shop.  YUMMY!  p.s. call ahead and order...you'll be glad you did when the line's out the door!

Two words:  BIG PANTIES.  Ok, well I know that's kind of weird--but I was bulging out of my pre-pregancy undies (even though I've lost 25 pounds since becoming pregnant...yea morning sickness) and dying to find new ones that actually fit.  I don't really fancy grannie panties, but when you're as big and tall as I am, you realize that past size 8 cotton panties don't come in bikini or hipster...they only come in "grannie"........  They had some AWESOME panties...in size XL (Bravado) bikini style...woohoo!  Priced not too bad...$11 a piece.  Now on to the cantaloupes attached to my chest:  size 38G...and I'm not that pregnant...barely four months.  Every bra I had wasn't working.  After reading Tina N's review of this store and Bravado bras, I was curious.  I called ahead, made sure they had my size and the woman working put them aside for me.  After I tried them on, I settled on two...a tank and a cotton bra...both nursing, but comfortable enough to wear right now.  The lady working there was SO helpful.  I've never even SEEN a nursing bra and although I'm not buying it for that purpose, I was still clueless about how it worked.  She explained it to me with not an ounce of condescension and was very attentive in making sure I got the right fit.  I ended up with 4 panties, 1 bra tank, 1 bra, and a bathing suit and a bill around $200.  I did try on some of the clothes, but for me, being as big as I am, clothes shopping at most maternity stores is very disappointing.  I was disappointed in the clothing options as usual because of the small sizes (S-XL), but I wasn't there for the clothes anyway.  I was there for essentials--underwear and bathing suit...all you really need being pregnant in hell, er...Phoenix.

If we didn't have a kid, we wouldn't be coming here, but since we do, it's a paradise for the little one. Consider becoming a member--it'll save you money in the long run...if you have a little one that LOOOOOOVES trains.  They have ramadas here, which are especially nice for birthday parties.  The new building of little trains is beautiful and mesmerizing.  The holiday lights are WONDERFUL!

Before reading this review, you should know I'm from the deep South...I grew up on this kind of food, know how to cook it, and come from a long, long line of people who cook it.  Ok, having said that...I'll pay good money to know what their recipe is for the collard greens and the red beans...seriously.  I am ashamed to say (and PLEASE DON'T TELL MY GRANNIE!) that these are the best collard greens I've EVER had.  And, the red beans...wow...just wow.  What makes it even better is that they are made without meat!  ALL of the sides are VEGETARIAN.  no way, right?  They make the most awesome collard greens and red beans and they're all without any creepy pork bones floatin' around.  Now for the -1 star part...having grown up in the south, I can tell you that real cornbread does not have sugar in it, people.  I know all y'all yankees like it sweet, and that's fine, but it ain't real southern!  Their grits aren't the best...they cook them too long and they're all mushy (Harlow's or Waffle House has better).  And, having grown up w/catfish fries at least monthly as a child, I can definitely say the catfish batter needs more salt and seasoning...it's a bit bland...still edible though, and where else can you get fried catfish around here w/a side of greens??  The other thing that kinda bums me out is that sides are around 3-4 bucks each...making my habit of ordering from the side menu a pit pricey.  Too bad they don't have a "side plate" like other southern restaurants do (like Po'Folks)....  Still, four stars it is...I'm addicted to the greens and beans!  And for those of you with a need for your sweet tea fix (you know who you are), it's quite tasty here.  p.s. get there early...before 11 or beware of a long line!

Ever since they upgraded the building, they've downgraded their food--maybe cut their food budget to pay for the building? The food all tastes a lot more processed and sugar-filled. I'd bet that they are using high fructose corn syrup vs. sugar in their waffle mix! Last two times we ate here, all of us had sugar crashes and stomach aches. I'm so bummed!!

My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)  Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!  For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said "we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!  Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.  Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.

I've been going here for almost a decade now.  I love it.  Great prices, great sushi, great chefs.  They have lots of ingredients, including some of the more rare ones like kampyo.  I almost always order a couple of rolls made "my way"...all veggies!  YUM!!!!

Great Ethiopian...only reason it doesn't get five stars is that I've been to Adams Morgan in DC and had some really great Ethiopian!  For the valley, this is one of the best places to find Ethiopian and the vegetarian platter is very good.  Plus, they have sweet wine here...guaranteed to make your visit even better!!

Amazing food!!  A separate gluten free vegan menu for those of us wanting to skip the wheat gluten.  I can't eat the tsoynamis, so the desserts here aren't as fun as the the Green in Phx that's next to Nami.  Even so, the food is to die for...especially the buffalo wings and chili fries.  OMG!  Besides the "junk" food tho', I love their sweet and sour chicken...yum!

So...have you ever done any stripping? Not the kind that requires nekkid-ness. The kind that requires the patience of the Dalai Lama, the chemicals of Monsanto, and the persistence of Abraham Lincoln. It's an ugly, ugly job...most people hate doing it...especially when the paint is caked on...a dozen layers of god-only-knows what kind and color. Plus, it's hard to breath without getting dizzy...the fumes are awful. And your hands get sore. Why does anyone sign up for that torture???  Enter Allison's and the big dipping vat. Get this...they dunk your over-painted, ugly, about to kill you because you can't scrape it anymore piece of furniture (in my case, some drawers and my bathroom door) into a giant vat of paint-removing awesomeness. Viola! Done.  And it's cheap. Because I think my time is worth more than $3 an hour (after buying all the crap I needed to actually strip it). Plus, the massage I needed after all those hours of trying to strip the stupid door was almost as much as just getting the door stripped. Now I know better...and now you do too. Don't strip it yourself. Save yourself from mind-numbing, back-breaking work and go here. (They pick up too just in case you don't have the balls to strap your bathroom door on your car's top with some twine and drive 25 from your house to the stripper's hoping for no wind.)  Update: to the lady that sent this business an email and then wrote a piss poor review: They didn't strike me as the most tech savvy group so they probably didn't get the email. But they do take little jobs...mine was under $100. Phone calls work best!

Well...the guacamole's good.  That's about all the good stuff I can say.  They're definitely pretentious in here.  NOT handicapped accessible.  And, if there's a fire, good luck getting out!!  But if you like to live dangerously, eat meat and drink lots of tequila, this is the place to go to get your Mex on.  If you're not a high roller, head down to Salsita's and get cheaper eats.

they had a nice section of plus sized dresses when I went in there this time...yea!  this place is fun to shop at and definitely not a secret to the die-hard shoppers here in the valley.  Be ready to fight for a parking spot in the lot or park around on the side with the library.

I go here for my kid...not for me.  If I got what I really wanted, it would be non-dairy coconut milk chocolate peanut butter chunk ice cream...yep.  But this'll do.  They have vegan sorbet gelatos.  The dairy ones are good too.  I cheated and tried the salted caramel.  My hubby likes it on top of a brownie.  Plus, they have sprinkles and sprinkles must be magic because kids will do anything for them!  I have used that to my advantage several times now!

I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.

This place has seriously gone downhill in the last 10 years. Remember when the menu had some interesting dishes on it and the staff was actually nice? Remember when the salsas actually had some flavor--seriously what is up with the green gunk that they call salsa...what IS that stuff??  Unfortunately, my recent visit ended up with me returning my food to the kitchen...I had to walk it up to the kitchen because our waiter never returned. I was a few bites into eating a taco salad--veggies and beans only--and came across a piece of super-greasy gristle in the grilled onions. Listen--I've worked in a kitchen on a grill--if you don't clean the grill well, you end up giving people crap like what ended up in my salad. It wasn't a piece of meat recently cooked--that gristle had been on the grill for awhile, drenched in oil over and over and moved around on the grill.  So, off I go to the kitchen to complain about the fact that they didn't clean the grill. Finally after standing there for a few minutes, a waiter finally got the manager for me. Guess what the manager said....wait for it.....  "They do their best to clean the grill."  What?? Excuse me??  #1, getting a piece of greasy gristle in your veggie salad is gross, but regardless that's NOT DOING YOUR BEST. Your best is cleaning off the grill! It's called a scraper. Learn how to use it...don't be lazy about scraping the grill. Lazy=crap in people's food. #2, What do you mean they do their best? Do you mean to tell me that you don't have standards of cleanliness back there in the kitchen? (side note...as I was standing there looking into the kitchen, I saw a basket of chips spilled on the floor as well as paper towels strewn under the sink. No one seemed to notice...do these people clean?) #3, Here's what you're supposed to say when someone finds a gross piece of yuck in their food: "I am SO sorry. That is UNACCEPTABLE. I am going to go talk to the kitchen staff RIGHT now.  I will take this off your bill and I will go get a new salad for you. I will watch them make it and I will make sure everything is done right."  FYI--that's not what happened. I didn't eat another bite at the restaurant. I was too grossed out by the filth in the kitchen and in my dish. I will not be going back. Boring/bland menu, inattentive staff, and a dirty kitchen. YUCK

AWESOME PLACE!  For vegans, vegetarians or meat-eaters, this is definitely the place to go if you want hearty food, a good cider (or beer) and a hip place to eat!  (Call ahead if you're vegan so they can make your pasty up fresh w/out the butter.)  The taste...well, to die for.  I've had both the meat and the veg pasties and I haven't found a bad one yet.  Usually I can only eat one pasty...but if you starve up for a bit beforehand and have enough room, the desserts are awesome too.    The ambiance of this place rocks!  Black and silver, British-pub nostalgia is the theme, and you'll find that the waiters are cool, hip people and the staff, busy busy busy right in front of you cooking up the next batch of pasties. So, if you come alone, no worries...prepare to be entertained by the huge staff working in the kitchen (which is right across the bar from you).  Alone, with friends or even w/the kids, there's something for everyone here...there's even a yummy peanut butter and jelly pasty for those picky kids (or discerning adults ready for dessert)!!

Granted, the market is, maybe, five minutes from my house (by car), BUT having said that, I LOVE IT.  3 words:  local, organic produce.  Yes, there are other vendors selling stuff besides food, but to be honest, I hardly pay attention to them because this market IS my grocery store.  I can get almost everything here except rice....so fresh-made tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, eggplant, zucchini, eggs, meat, hummus, pita chips, bread, cookies, salsa, cheese (goat and cow), oil, hand-made pasta, watermelon, peaches, potatoes, oranges, orange juice, greens, dried beans, string beans,...I could go on--really...but you should just go check it out yourself!  Besides food, cleaning supplies and dog biscuits, flowers, crafts and books round out the goods there, but the market's main thrust is food.  The fact that all this stuff is fresh, local and most of it organic is just amazing.  Why do you need to go to a grocery store and buy food from China or even Mexico, when you can just buy it from Arizona??  I don't understand why everyone in Phoenix isn't at this market, but I guess if everyone shopped here, it would suck for me.  :)  Some tips:  Wednesday nights the market shoppers wane down to only the hard core, so if you're just looking to get your grocery shoppin' done in a jiffy--produce, eggs, meat and salsa, try 4-8pm Wed.  If you want more choices and more vendors (including the tortilla guy!) , go Saturday 8am-1pm.  Also, the produce is ridiculously cheap here.  We usually fill up three shopping baskets full of produce and it always costs under $25.  It's even cheaper than Sprouts, people!  Besides...Sprouts produce is mostly from Mexico (where they practice "viva la DDT", literally).

If you like bland food, this is definitely the place to go!!!  Ok, those of you who like bland food will never admit it and that's ok, but if you are looking for ethnic or even interesting food (or Greek/Mediterranean like it says in the categories), don't go here.  Their food lacks spice.  If you are looking for a lunch place and you like chicken salad sandwiches and plain hummus, this is your place.  Also, if you like the food at Hob Nobs down the street, this is comparable.

Eating vegetarian there is just not that exciting to me...I've eaten enough hummus in my life that it's no longer exotic or unique to get a plate of plain hummus with some pita. Maybe for others hummus is still exciting?  I had their blueberry shake a few years ago and thought it was wonderful but got heartburn afterwards, so I've never tried it again. I would recommend it though. It's made from yogurt and blueberries (I can no longer tolerate cow yogurt). I like their tofu scrambles too.  I would have given it three stars if not for the last experience I had here at the indian school location. I got the salad, on special and thought it was too acidic and needed some protein to mellow it out...like nuts. About halfway through (because I'm distracted by feeding my child), I remember that the menu said it came with pine nuts. I stop eating and try to flag down the server. About five minutes later (not kidding...poor service) when I'm about to just walk to the kitchen window myself, the server sees me. I explain it to him and he goes to the kitchen with my plate. They say they did put nuts on it. I said, no they didn't. And then they say they did and they're sorry, but they can't give me more. ???  Yes, now you all know that either I have short-term memory loss or I like to lie to get lots of pine nuts because I have a pine nut addiction and I just HAVE to have them and will go so far as to lie to my waiter to get them. Wtf.  I didn't eat anymore of the salad. I lose my appetite when people falsely accuse me of lying (especially about pine nuts). I don't need to go back to Pita Jungle. The hummus was overrated anyway! I can just go to the Mediterranean deli on 16th st!

I was very surprised by the food and customer service here...I got the vegan quinoa burger with the mushrooms and cream sauce.  Super yummy, but what's better is that it was yummy drive thru food!  My kidlet was with me and I couldn't find anything kid-like on the menu.  When I got to the window, I asked if they could make him a PBJ and give us a side of broccoli.  "Of course!" was the reply and I was instantly in love!  Yea for yummy drive thru and healthy kid drive thru food too!

I tried the shrimp burrito per the review on here. One of the worst I've had...ever. (Salsitas' has a good one, IMO.) It just didn't taste that good...it was spicy, which I like, but the flavor was boring. Hubby and kid had bean burritos and weren't impressed either.  Everything was WAY over salted. And, I know this is TMI, but we all spent hours in the bathroom the next day. :( We will not go back.

Greg's extremely knowledgeable & I've gotten lots of great ideas on permaculture, gardening, water harvesting, and urban orcharding from his urban farm!  He does a thorough tour of it and always has some new project going on that makes subsequent tours interesting.  He loves to be looking at "what's next" so often his new projects include a new or leading edge technology or method.  Worth a visit, especially during the nicer months in Phoenix!

If I was going to eat meat, I wouldn't buy it here...not a bit of it is organic or grass-fed or even humanely raised...BUT I do go here to get our cat and dog food...yes, that's hypocritical, I know, but it's kind of like recycling ('cause they're using parts to make it).  They have frozen 1 lb containers of GROUND raw meat with BONES!!!  We get the chicken.  This saves me from having to do the dirty work of grinding it myself.  Plus, my cats and dog are all relatively small, so we can feed the three cats and dog on a container a day...works out to about a buck fifty...a very good deal.  They sell frozen hearts separately for the furry friends too.  They also now carry a selection of WILD meat...YEA!!!  I've tasted a bit...mostly en route to my little one's gullet.  But it's expensive.  Good thing only the furry creatures in our house eat meat regularly!  (p.s. I know folks are raving about the BBQ here...but I can't help thinking they haven't ever been to Memphis, TN (the epicenter of amazing BBQ).  Comparatively, this is not good BBQ.  If you're desperate, ok...but Honey Bear's better in a pinch.)

My favorite is the Thai pizza sans chicken.  Wow.  Yum!  Anyone that puts bean sprouts on their pizza and can pull it off with flair and taste has to be given kudos!  Great veggie pizza by the slice...there's always one meat, one veg, and cheese...perfect!  Cozy spot to have a beer and grab a slice.  Plus, they usually have a special for two slices and a beer...so even better!

Lots of reasons to love this place:  1, the owner is kind and gracious, the staff are welcoming, and it's a small, local business.  2, their dine-in food is yummy--try the falafel sandwich and hummus! (I haven't tried the meat (because I'm mostly vegetarian) but my meat-eating friends say it's yummy too.)  3, the grocery, deli and bakery have a good selection. They make very addicting za'atar gluten-free pita chips (and gluten ones)...so good to dip into their jalapeño hummus! They also make pita chips with a cinnamon sugar topping which seem to disappear suddenly everytime children are around. They carry some unique and hard-to-find feta cheeses, spices, and jarred items (like nuts in honey). If you are having a party, there are lots of ready to serve or heat and serve items (the spinach pies are great!).  4, the omg-I'll-sell-my-mama-to-get-this lemonade! Delicious and homemade. Note to vegans--it's made with honey. It's been awarded best lemonade in the city many times by the Phx New Times...the praise is well-deserved!

They're expensive.  But they have very good customer service and if they screw up, which only happened once to me...my pants came back unpressed, they fix it.  Comparatively, this is one of the better dry cleaners in the cenpho area.

I have two skirts I bought from here almost 4 years ago...I've worn them a lot...almost incessantly while I was preggers--and they are still in great shape!  So, Bunky has good quality clothing worth spending your money for!  And, while their clothing is geared to a smaller crowd, the owner is cognizant of it and was more than happy to order a larger size in a different color for me--yea!

Trustworthy.  Honest.  Friendly.  That's about all that needs to be said about this place...but on top of that they're local and woman-owned.  I took my car in for an oil change and asked them to see if anything was going on (it's an old car and wasn't sounding all that happy).  They figured it out, told me, gave me a quote and then didn't use any scare tactics or pressure me.  They told me honestly that some of the work didn't really need to be done and then some was more urgent.  That's a very different experience than I've gotten at other places!!  I will be back!!

We call this place "Thai Denny's" because it's housed in what looks like a cheap-o diner from the 70's.  It's quaint and sitting next to the street gives you a nice view of the interesting folks walking along McDowell and the incessant Phx Art Museum display of the people walking on forever.  Anyway, I'm giving this place five stars...NOT because it's the best Thai food I've ever had, but because this place is CONSISTENTLY good, no matter what I order.  And it's relatively cheap...the lunch specials are cheap, but yet the portions are large.  The dinner's are pretty cheap too.  The waitstaff is constantly filling up our water glasses...we joke and say they're "water ninjas" because sometimes our water glasses get filled without us even knowing how...they're THAT good.  All the curries here rock, the pad thai is great, the Tom Yum soup is good.  No matter what we order, it comes out in light-speed timing, it's tasty, and we're happy.

Hard to find, but painted all yellow, so once you see it behind all the other buildings on the lot, you'll know it.  Would highly recommend the simply pizza crust...a vegan gluten free creation and yummy!  The cookies are decent as are the bagels...altho' they are more like english muffins than bagels.  They always have samples out to try...each day's a different theme.

Pros: --By far the best kids' museum in the state. --Climbing structure inside is amazing and fun for adults and kids. --Lots of great activities and a room especially for the under 3's. --Some of the exhibits change out so you can often find something new. --Art activities vary along with with a theme of the month and include activities for all ages.  Cons: --Expensive. --Crowded with school groups during the week. --You can lose your kid in the noodle forest...would highly suggest a sticker or tag on them with your phone number. --There's this one staff member that works there that harassed me because my child was eating in the "wrong" place and I didn't get the cracker away from my kid quickly enough for him.  Other than him, the staff isn't very happy, but they're not overly mean either.  Maybe they're stressed out?  In any case, you've been warned...follow the rules (even the ones they don't tell you) and you won't get yelled at!!

LOVE the physical attributes of this studio...by far one of the most beautiful studios I've been to...the high ceilings, the floor to ceiling windows and the industrial design make it an interesting and peaceful place to do yoga.  My favorite instructor is....well, maybe I shouldn't say because then there will be a waiting list for my class!!!  Decent prices, especially if you buy in a package and really awesome boutique in the front where you can buy some spectacular handmade jewelry and lovely yoga accoutrements.

Ok...I gave it one star, and I'm about as GREEN as they come.  I loved the idea of an "organic" cleaner and the fact that this is the closest cleaner to my house helped lower my carbon footprint.  However, after two bad experiences at this dry cleaner and some serious money spent, I did some research and here's the bottom line: THEY ARE NOT A GREEN COMPANY.  (I've listed several sites here where you can do your own research...don't take my word for it.)  Yes, you read that correctly...this dry cleaner is using the word "organic" and using it to mean they are "green".  When a company says they are doing something good for the environment and they really aren't, It's called green-washing.  http://www.greenearthcleaning.com/flash_earth.aspx: "Beware of "green washing"!  The second most common type of solvent used in dry cleaning is hydrocarbon, also petroleum-based. Hydrocarbon is sometimes marketed as "organic". Beware! From a chemistry standpoint, anything with a chain of carbons can be labeled "organic". That doesn't mean it's environmentally friendly or chemical-free."  According to Organic Cleaners website, they use a hydrocarbon called DF-2000 which is manufactured by ExxonMobil Corporation.  According to the EPA, DF-2000 is a neurotoxin.  Granted, DF-2000 is marginally better than tetrachloroethylene (aka: perchloroethylene, perc, TCE, EVIL!!!)  TCE can be found in Phoenix's water supply...it's a VERY scary chemical...carcinogenic, causes reproductive problems, etc..  But, I'm not sure which I'd rather have...slow death via neurotoxin build-up or no children and a quicker chemo-death via cancer.  Hmmm, choices, choices.  GREEN DRY-CLEANING DOES EXIST, BUT NOT AT ORGANIC CLEANERS!  So, instead of wasting your money at this dry cleaning scam, use wet cleaning (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_cleaning) or wait for the non-toxic process that uses silicone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreenEarth_Cleaning) to come to our city.  Other resources: http://www.livescience.com/health/070130_bad_drycleaning.html http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/33/30_33drycleaning.html  Here's a green suggestion:  Take your dry-clean only clothes and hang them on the line outside to air-out and try to get a few more days out of them.   Besides the fact that Organic Cleaners is still using toxic chemicals to dry-clean clothing, I have one more bone to pick.  They return my clothes to me in PLASTIC bags, with THROW-AWAY hangers, and with a sticker stuck to the tag of my garment which must require some sort of toxic adhesive (the damn thing stuck so hard to my tag that it ripped the tag when I took it off).  Why do they use plastic bags and why wouldn't they just re-use the hangers I brought my clothes on???  What a scam this place is!  Green my ass.   Do me a favor people, stop going to this place.  Take the money you're saving and DONATE it to an environmental group that's doing good work that you believe in.

LOVE it here.  Small, homey, and yummy food.  Great patio!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!  The kid loves it...especially the beans.  They have jamaica, horchata and tamarindo fresh made to drink too.  YUM!  (The margaritas are very good here too!  And cheap!)

Veggie burger is YUMMY...I think it might be deep fried after they dip it in cajun seasoning (optional)...definitely one of the best I've had, but not one you'd want to eat a lot of (cuz of that deep fryin' awesomeness). They also had some sort of alcoholic shot that was delish. Shake and the fries definitely reminded me of 1980s McD's!  The atmosphere is casual...like a cross between a 50's diner and an outside biker bar. Love it!

They took very good care of our little pup...she's an oldie but goodie.  We didn't use the pet resort part of Tailwinds (maybe we'll go somewhere someday when we need a dog-sitter).  We used the grooming part of this resort.  They were very good.  And $40, which is comparable to most other grooming spots.  We would certainly recommend them.

Indian comfort food and grocery.  Dinner (in the restaurant section of this building) is served traditionally with several other dishes to on your tray to balance the palate.  Everything is made fresh right as you order it...the vegetables chopped, the dishes spiced.  Cheap price for so much food including dessert!  Soooo delicious!!  Long vegetarian menu. Two TVs in the place play Bollywood movies and videos.  Funzies!

I should probably rate this one star so that none of you will come here...it's already packed in here most of the time! Delicious, large portions, cheap, and vegetarian selections on the menu!  Our vegetarian favorites are the tamarind soup (I get it without tofu because I don't like that pre-fried tofu they use) and the vermicelli dish.  Service, when the place is packed, is not super attentive. When the waitstaff is not swamped, they're more attentive...you can always just go up to the front desk by the kitchen and for some reason, that guy knows everything going on or can find out quickly.

Definitely one of the better Goodwills in the valley.  They have pretty good stuff, but it's a big store, so it's not cramped like some Goodwills that I've been in.  The employees are helpful and don't have an attitude.  The best part of this store is the clothes, bags/purses, and random bags of stuff in the back.  If you're looking for household items or kids' toys, then go to the 'burbs...they have better stuff out there.

I order my own smoothie...a chocolate, peanut butter, banana rice milk smoothie when I go here.  Yum.  It's nice to be able to get a vegan treat when I'm on this side of town!!  We usually go thru the drive thru, but the inside's alright.  They have a kid play area, which is super handy when you have little ones.  I also like the giant chessboard inside.  Don't expect it to be too fancy though...the inside looks like someone decorated it with mix matched pieces they found at a garage sale!  Is it terrible for me to say it might have been designed by a man?!  Sorry guys.  Anyway, ignore the insides and go get your treats here!

OH my....$20 for a mani pedi and a back massaging chair??  WOW.  AMAZING place.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it here.  I take all my friends and family here.  Even my hubby's been in.  They are quick, thorough, professional and cheap!!  It's almost always packed in here, but they always get you in quickly!

Wasn't impressed.  The Brazilian hurt more than a regular Brazilian.  Whatever it is that they use isn't very good for my parts down there...or the tech sucked.  Either way, I won't be going back to this place.  Slow and painful....

I'm not really a piercing kind of person...oh, you know what I mean.  There are those that like it and have all sorts of piercings...everywhere.  That's cool, but just not for me.  That being said, I didn't feel like an outsider when I walked in here.  They were very very nice to me even when I asked novice questions.  I bought a pair of loops for my second ear piercings and told the guy behind the counter that I couldn't get the studs out that were in there now...HTC put them in there a few years back.  They offered to take the ones I had in there out and put the loops in for me.  Yes, I'm that high maintenance!  Great customer service and Marilyn is friendly, professional, and kind...I can't say enough about how welcome I felt here!  I won't ever go anywhere else for piercings again...even though it'll probably be just another ring in my ear!!!

LOVE it here.  Small, homey, and yummy food.  Great patio!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!  The kid loves it...especially the beans.  They have jamaica, horchata and tamarindo fresh made to drink too.  YUM!

Dr. Heffelfinger is fantastic!  We went in with our 11-month old son to have an InfantSEE exam (which is FREE by the way...optometrists choose whether they want to participate in this nationwide program and Dr. Heffelfinger does.)  The location is in a small building on the north side of Camelback between Central and 3rd Avenues.  It's an older building, but they did a great job with the inside and it feels bright and modern in there.  We filled out paperwork and met Dr. Heffelfinger.  She was very nice...our son liked her and didn't have his usual "afraid of strangers" shyness.  The exam took about 45 minutes, which included a twenty minute break in the middle for our son's pupils to expand.  He was totally enraptured by the whole exam because the Dr. kept him thoroughly entertained!  She was very gentle with him and was completely flexible with "his schedule", which included him not wanting to do one part of the eye exam...she just skipped it and came back to it later instead of trying to force him to continue.  It could have been a very trying experience for all involved, but we were pleasantly surprised.  We were really impressed with the exam, her competency and thoroughness, and her ability to keep him happy and entertained!  (also...I got my glasses adjusted before we left ...they were very out of whack and the staff was happy to adjust them multiple times for me.)

I went back to have my eyes checked...since Dr. H was so good with my son, I figured she'd be good with me as well.  It went better than I expected.  She was extremely thorough.  It was the most thorough exam I've ever experienced...I also asked a lot of questions, which both Dr. H and the staff answered without any impatience.  I had some eye discomfort reading and working on the computer and when I mentioned it, Dr. H asked me several questions, checked out my eyes and then asked if I wanted a reading prescription--not for bifocals--but to remove the near-sighted part of my script so that my eyes' natural ability to focus up close weren't fighting my regular glasses script when I was looking at things up close (like a book or a computer).  Since I got this "special" reading prescription, I am now enjoying reading again!!!  What's remarkable is that she LISTENED TO ME and figured out what the issue was--I've mentioned this to every eye doc I've had since I first got glasses (20 years ago) and she's the first one who's figured it out.  If I could give her 10 stars, I would!!!!!

This review is for the optical department:  I'm not sure what was worse...the arrogance of the optician or the ignorance. 1)  When I asked to put my regular prescription into a pair of glasses I'd found with plastic lenses, she said it couldn't be done.  I handed her the glasses on my face and said "Walmart can do it." She tapped the lens and said "They seem like they're plastic."  (Yes, I know they are because I bought them...duh. Did she think I was lying???)  2) I explained my prescription for my second pair of glasses, but she said "I've been in the field for 15 years and I've never heard of a prescription like that." (Yeah, probably because you haven't ever worked for any good doctors!)  Even after I explained the reason for it and how it worked, she was looking at me like I had four heads and said "I would have to see the prescription to verify that."  (Really? Because eyeglasses prescriptions are something people lie about?? And wouldn't you see the prescription anyway when you make the glasses?  Ugh.)  2) On top of it, when I told her that I usually have my second prescription put in a pair of reader frames, she said they couldn't do that. I told her that I've never heard of an optical shop that can't do it and in the five lenses I've put into my reading frames, not one optical shop has refused me...I told her that I'd just come from Target and they could do it. She called her supervisor to verify that they couldn't do it and the supervisor said "No, of course we don't do that." When she told her that Target will do it, the supervisor said, "I guess they're really desperate."  Wow...maybe they are just more competent at making glasses over at Target or at any of the other places I've gotten my reading frame lenses replaced.

Shell, the founder and midwife here at Midwives Rising, was with me during my home birth as an emergency backup for my midwife.  She was wonderful...and her hands are small!  I say that because that's something you usually don't consider when choosing a midwife, but when you're at 7cm and they are checking your progress by sticking their hands in, it becomes something that you think about!!  Besides the small hands, Shell's a wonderful midwife for a about a billion other reasons.  1) She's an advocate for you.  She believes in you.  She believes in your power and your ability to birth that human being you've just grown inside you.  She believes in you knowing as much as possible about the process your going through and your body.  2)  She makes chocolate out of your placenta!!!  (if you want it of course.)  3) She supports the community through Midwives Rising and supports women's holistic health and empowerment in many ways.  Yes, she's a midwife, but she also does things like pap smears.  I just had my annual exam there.  It was cheap. It was actually kind of fun. It was way more empowering than being seen by an MD.  I highly recommend it!

I bought a Groupon for this place...$49 for a cleaning.  I was really excited about it since I hadn't had a dental exam in awhile and I had a tooth that was bugging me...I figured I could at least find out whether it was a cavity.  The office location is in an old building off of 19th Ave just north of Indian School and it's hard to figure out where to park or even where to go once you get in the building.  And while they've done a decent job trying to make the inside of their office look better, the whole place still feels a bit dismal...maybe it's the lack of lighting?  Anyway, after arriving and filling out the paperwork, they took me back and proceeded to check my gums and give me x-rays.  The hygienist and tech were curt and not particularly friendly, but they did their job quickly.  Then the hygienist informs me that they cannot do a teeth cleaning on me because supposedly I have periodontal disease.  hmmm.  so, I ask, what causes it, where is it specifically, etc.  Turns out that I have some spots in my mouth where the gums are too deep.  There are three spots, 2 of them on each side of the tooth that hurts and one on the other side of my mouth next to one of my back molars.  Why three spots=periodontal disease, I don't know, but my bigger concern is "do I have a cavity?"  I get the stat answer "the doc will have to look at the x-rays and tell you that"....  So, in comes the Dr.  Her exact words were "You probably have a cavity back there."   what????  probably??  So, I ask "What do you mean 'probably'?"  "Well, I would suggest that you go ahead and get it filled since it's probably a cavity, but we can't really tell right now."  ???  Um...I remember back in the day, when I had an awesome dentist, that there was no question to my dentist whether or not I had a cavity...you either do or you don't...period.  Why is this Dr. so confused?  look at the x-ray, poke around at my tooth and and answer yes or no...that's your job.  I'm not going to get a tooth filled just for the hell of it!  The doc then leaves and the office manager comes over to get me.  Confused, I ask, "Aren't I going to get my teeth cleaned?"  I am told that since I have periodontal disease they can't clean my teeth and that I will have to fix the periodontal disease first.  I am baffled that they can't avoid the two spots in my mouth...but fine, refund my money and I'll be on my way to another doc that can actually figure out whether I have a cavity.  No luck getting my money back...in fact, she whisks me away to a room they've set up with creepy posters of periodontal disease and leaves me to read a pamphlet about it.  When she returns, a full 5 minutes later, she proceeds to try and sell me their periodontal disease treatment...a whopping 875 bucks...complete with the "your teeth are going to fall out and you have to get this done soon."  She tells me that this is the "discounted rate especially for Groupon holders" and that they will apply my $49 credit with their office to the total.  Feeling like I'm in some sort of multi-level marketing meeting where they're trying to sell me a get rich quick scheme, I tell her that I don't have that kind of cash laying around.  Unfortunately, that doesn't phase her sales pitch at all.  She says they have credit financing that I can apply for right then...yes, kids, I can take out a loan to get my teeth cleaned...only 20% interest.  At that point, I'm thinking it's candid camera and someone's going to jump out and say "just kidding...hahahaha, we really gotcha!"  But no such luck, I decline the loan offer and leave their office as quickly as possible...no refund, no teeth cleaning, and no clear answer on whether I have a cavity.  I'm giving this place one star for these reasons: -incompetent dentist -ridiculous sales pitch...they clearly need money if they want me to get a filling just for the heck of it! -not giving my money back or at least cleaning my teeth -dismal office  (Incidentally, my husband went to his dentist and they said he had periodontal disease too.  They did a regular cleaning on his teeth that day and then told him to come back for several deep cleanings, which only totaled $500!)  (as of 11/18/10:  I went to my hub's dentist.  I don't have periodontal disease and I don't have a cavity.  huh....)

Best Mexican fast food in the valley.  DON'T go to other Salsita's expecting what you get here at the 16th St location.  This is the best one!!!  We eat here waaaay to much to be unbiased, just so you know.....  Bean burritos, cheese quesadillas, and occasional shrimp burritos are our staples.  Make sure to order guaca-pico on your burrito...that's what they call it.  And, we think the day cook is better than the night cook, but they are both very good.  The inside is a fun, divey, middle of the night and your kid still isn't asleep-friendly kind of place.  Salsa bar and homemade frescas round out the Filiberto's style menu.

How can one not love vegan pastries??  The pop tarts are amazing.  They use organic strawberry preserves, thank goodness, because we all know how toxic non-organic strawberries are these days.  The cupcakes are great and my friend tells me the coffee is good too (I don't imbibe!).  We come here often...when we want a treat of course!  If you get there early, sometimes they have discounted yummies from the day before!!!!

Raw vegan cheesecake anyone? Had the gals here make a raw vegan blueberry cheesecake for my birthday. It was delectably rich and amazingly good. Who knew cashews could taste so amazing?!!  They've now made birthday cakes four times for us (this was the first raw one) and I highly recommend them for vegan birthday cakes! Delicious!  And their daily selections just keeps getting better...pop tarts and scones along with the cupcakes, cookies, and brownies. Tuesdays they have gluten-free cupcakes (altho' they have GF macaroons every day). They've also had a few mini-pies lately too! Check facebook for their selection of the day!  (Oh, they've just installed a bike rack outside) (And they display art from local artists, changes every month or so.)

If you have a kid between the ages of 18 months and 8 years, this is a FANTASTIC way for them to spend a morning or afternoon.  Everything is at kid-eye-level and is geared towards them.  They give you a stamp to get admission all day, so mid-way during our visit, the little one got hungry.  So, we went off to eat at the food court and check out the carousel, train and amusement rides that are now in the middle of that area.  Arizona Mills is now marketing itself more to kids.  Then we headed back in, stared at some more fish and crabs and played in their play area (a giant climbing structure).  It is expensive, but we had a coupon and only paid $10 a piece and the little one was free.  It was worth that though...our son had a blast and so did we.  After reading all the terrible reviews on this place on Yelp, I was worried.  Thankfully, I was very pleasantly surprised.  If you're an adult, don't expect to see a world class aquarium...hello--it's in a mall!  But if you're a kid, prepare to be dazzled by an aquarium built just for you--like the tunnels underneath tanks that you can crawl into and look at the fish from inside their tanks!!  Cool!!!

The cheese dip was alright.  The bartender was not great.  And why do I feel 80 when I walk in here?  Oh, that's right.  All the "kids" working as staff were born in the 90s!  Plus, the frat guys sitting on the porch and around the bar yelling at the football on the 50 TVs in here probably didn't make me feel any younger.  I suppose if you were born after 1990, you should go here.  If not, don't do it.  You just look older under all those fluorescent lights!

The Bee's Knees is a little gem along 16th St that you might miss if you drive too fast...sandwiched between a Chinese "benevolent association" and a little gated apartment complex, this building has been transformed into an art gallery and shop.  Parking is along the building's north wall (on Cypress), which now displays a mural by one of the artists.  My friend and I stumbled upon the Bee's Knees by word of mouth and just happened to catch the shop open on one of their off days.  The owners, Julia and her husband (who is one of the artists featured in the gallery), let us shop and peruse the place even tho' they were technically closed.  The shop itself sells antiques, resale clothing/accessories, and some artist-crafted jewelry and quirky items.  I'm a larger size and was happy to see that there was a XL section with a couple of great finds.  Though, my friend, who is a S found just as much as I did.  My favorite part about the shop is the HUGE mirror in the clothing area...you rarely get to try on clothes where you can see EVERYTHING!  They have a large selection of men's and women's jeans...so there's something for everyone.  Also found a great pair of earrings--one of the artists takes old skateboards and makes earrings out of them...yea for recycling!  They're fabulous!!  I'm not sure exactly what it was about the inside of the shop, but even though it had high ceilings, it was comfy and almost homey...could have been the free chocolates up at the desk or the owners' hospitality or the nostalgic antiques lining the wall.  All I know is that I want to go back soon!!

First I'll say that the service is OUTSTANDING! Possibly the best I've ever experienced!!  And, second, I hated the food. I'm sorry--I'm sure it's good for many of you out there that love cheese, bacon and butter. I tried to order some non-greasy sounding vegetable sides but they were so heavy in cream and butter than I ended up only taking a few bites of each.  I'm from the south and really, sometimes I would just like a southern place that does justice to what we ate most of the time--freshly picked field peas and a side of buttermilk cornbread with some serious raw fixin's on the side like green onions right out of the garden, freshly picked tomatoes and cucumbers and some home-canned jalapeño peppers (and once in awhile a side of fried okra). None of those were cream, butter and meat-laden and they were still awesome and yummy!

Best part of this store:  they have all the big girl clothes on one rack.  If you are a big girl like myself, you know the exquisite pain of shopping in most vintage/thrift stores...it's terrible to find lots of beautiful dresses and they're all in size negative 7 when you're a positive 18!  So I LOVE it here.  Best vintage store ever.  Plus, the jewelry is super fun!

I am sitting here with our 15 year old cat Squeakers at 5am, trying to wrap my head around having spent 1000s of dollars at this veterinarian and still here's my cat sitting here with me in pain and moving her mouth up and down. I can smell the rot from here. We asked this veterinarian to do ONE thing last year--remove ALL of her teeth. Most were rotten and we knew the rest would be going soon.  Of course the surgery was estimated to be almost $1000. We'd already prepared ourselves for that since this vet had also removed my dog's teeth and another cat's teeth, both now passed. Having done teeth surgery so many times, we knew what we were facing. When you put an old cat or dog under, there are extra expenses, specifically bloodwork, because they don't want to be doing surgery on a cat/dog that's not going to survive the recovery. So we knew what to expect since our other cat and dog were old as well and we'd already forked over our credit cards to North Kenilworth for those procedures.  The day of the surgery, everything seemed to go well. The vet understood us clearly when we said "Please remove ALL of her teeth whether they are good or not. She is old and we want this to be her last surgery." The vet calls after the surgery and says "She's doing well. We removed all the teeth except one because it looked really good." EXCUSE ME? I had to ask her to repeat it!! I was shocked and angry that they'd completely ignored what we'd asked them to do and done what would make them the most money--because guess what? I sit here right now, a year later with my cat and a rotten tooth in her mouth. If I want to get it removed, it will cost at least another $600. Keeping a tooth in a 14 year old cat when we specifically requested all of them out because we know they will go rotten is just money gouging!  We'd had decent service up until then (the vet helped us give hospice care to our cat Venus who passed away a few years ago). I know something has changed; I'm just not sure what. I wouldn't necessarily have written a review (look at all their five star reviews) if it hadn't been for our 17 year old cat looking like death two months ago. Of course, I called immediately and told the receptionist that I wanted to get him some IV fluids ASAP and could I come in that day because my cat looked like he was literally dying--unable to walk, drowsy, wouldn't eat or drink. The receptionist put me on hold and then came back on and said the earliest she could get me in was next week--a full 6 days from when I was calling. I pleaded with her and told her that our cat might be dead by then and said, "I just think he needs some IV fluids--I've done hospice care for another cat. Please, I just need to get him some fluids." She refused and said they had no openings nor could they give me any IV fluids.  That was the last straw--unwilling to help one of your long-standing patients in his dying hour. Seriously, that cat has had teeth surgery at N Kenilworth too and we've spent 1000s there just on him (because he also has kidney disease). But they refused to help AT ALL. I was so shocked and appalled that I was crying as I looked on yelp and found another vet that could get us in--madison vet & animal hospital. I called back to North Kenilworth, asked them transfer all our records for our pets that are still with us on the planet (which they didn't do--I had to call two more times), and took our beloved cat into the other vet the next day and got him IV fluids. He is still alive--just barely--but he would have DIED if I'd waited for North Kenilworth.  So I would not recommend them. I know I am in the minority. But be careful with your pets and your wallet here. And if you have an emergency, don't expect them to help you or your pets. Now I'm going to go shell out another $600 for another surgery for Squeakers. Le sigh. I think I should get a refund for her first surgery. Just ridiculous!

I think you can always tell the quality of a Thai restaurant by how good their Pad Thai is!  This place has YUMMY Pad Thai!!!!! (I've tried the veggie and tofu, no egg.) The veggie spring rolls are good as well. Very friendly and very accommodating!  They have a drive-thru for take out!!

I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to my 'hood.  C'est la vie.  As the other reviewer said, the service is slower than Methuselah and not really worth the wait because it's just not that good.  We ordered some cheese quesadillas...you'd think it'd be impossible to mess these up.  Nope...it's possible.  There was actually too much cheese on it...about an inch of cheese...I'm not kidding...it was really crazy.  The lemonade is decent, but if you're in the area, why not go to the Middle Eastern bakery next door and get really good fresh squeezed stuff with a hint of orange-flower water--it's excellent.  We went back twice more thinking that maybe this place would get better.  It didn't.  :(

Wait staff suggested two vegetarian dishes to us. They were incredible. I've never eaten Cambodian before so I can't tell you if they were authentic, but it was unlike any Asian food I've tasted (which includes Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese). The ingredients were probably similar, but the flavors of the dishes were new to me!  Setting was cozy/potentially romantic and the service was good. Highly recommend trying this place!

Very yummy gelato...best part was that they had a larger than normal selection of sorbets.  We had tangerine pineapple and it was delicious!  It's in Paradise Valley mall, next to the food court.  They also have a punch card, so if you're a regular over this direction, get a punch card so you can get free gelato!

The art openings here are superb...always fabulous food and drinks plus often a local musician!  The owners, Steve and Julia, are uber helpful...even coming to our house to help us hang our newly procured art!  The Bee's Knees boutique is also open during gallery nights, so after you've perused the fine art, you can head inside to check out the other "art"...handmade jewelry, collectables, accessories and clothes.  To find out about gallery openings in advance, get on their mailing list or check out FB.  The quality of art being shown here is amazing...they bring in very unique, often famous and always talented artists.  Artists are encouraged to do installations as well as "experiential" art...so I highly recommend gallery nights here!!  (Also, younger artists (children) are welcome here on gallery openings.  Once they even had a snow cone machine going!!!)

I was surprised to see that the negative reviews were filtered out for Dr. Butler, so I thought I'd share my experience since mine probably won't get filtered out (I've yelped a lot):  While I found the biological dentistry aspect of Dr. Butler's practice enticing and a welcome reprieve from the fake sugar and color-laden dentistry practices that are the norm, I didn't have a good experience with the practice as a whole. As one of the filtered reviews said, the billing can be nightmarish.  However, none of that stopped me from going--instead it was the almost threatening-sounding letter I got, signed by "Dr. Lisa", stating that I was not following her treatment plan. At the time, I had done the treatment I could afford up to that point--she wanted to do another grand worth of work on my mouth and not a dime of it was covered by insurance. At the time, there was just no money for it in my budget. But why send me a letter like that? It was very weird and it felt like a personal attack--that somehow I was being irresponsible with my teeth by not following her plan. So I transferred my records to another dentist and got the work done for $160, which I could afford at the time.  So if you have an unlimited budget and are willing to do whatever she says (and never defy her by not following her timelines/plans), you will probably have a good experience...but again, her office staff is not great, so you'll have to keep on them--follow up with any messages you leave because they might not get them or return your call.

Wow--what a great experience in customer service! I came in the shop about 1/2 an hour before they closed and tried on about a dozen shoes. They have a great selection of shoes...some newer brands like Altra, which is a zero drop neutral shoe in varying degrees of cushion from minimal to super-cushy (I made that word up peeps...not sure what the technical term for max cushion is!).  I'm not a runner, but I know my way around running shoes I think. I know I need a neutral shoe and the gent that was helping me didn't argue with me. That was not my experience at the Runner's Den where the guy helping me argued with me that I needed a stability shoe. I've had broken and twisted ankles all my life and a few years ago, the surgeon's dx'd me with a foot deformity and confirmed that yes, I do really supinate...at which point they did a calcaneal osteotomy and an arthroscopy to reattach all the ligaments and a tendon...on both feet......Anyway, I digress. Point is, I know my feet! And they don't pronate. And this guy helping me here at iRun trusted me. I appreciate that.  I ended up not buying any shoes...I also have quite a large foot and they only go up to size 10 for women. But it was helpful to try on the size 11 in men's to see how they fit and which cushion level I needed. There was no pressure from the salesperson and he didn't seem to mind at all that I kept him over the closing time by 20 minutes. Just all around friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend this place!

Heaven in a sandwich...at least if you're vegetarian.  They have a cheesesteak sandwich made from faux steak...it's extra especially yummy if you get the peppers and onions.  However, my favorite is the cole turkey...cole slaw, thousand island, and faux turkey equals happiness.  Highly recommend!!!

Pizza is very good.  why the two stars then?  Well.....they have a baked mac & cheese on their menu that looks super yummy.  So, when we went here w/our kid and saw it, we thought, "Maybe they have it on the kid's menu."  To our delight, it was there.  Then, when our child's dinner came out, to our HORROR, it was KRAFT MAC & CHEEZE.  Yes, people, it was that orange pasta...dry and not creamy at all.  My kid was hungry and our food hadn't come out yet, so we didn't send it back, but mostly, I think I was honestly in shock for the next few hours about the whole situation.  Thank goodness he didn't eat much of it anyway (because it sucks!).  Red Robin has better mac & cheese for kids and that's not saying much.  Hello Humble Pie...KIDS ARE PEOPLE TOO.  Why not serve the good stuff to little ones???  At the least, if you are going to continue to serve shitty food to kids, please make that clear on your kid's menu so we adults can make informed decisions....i.e., "this is the crap...er...kraft mac and cheese, not the good stuff we serve to adults."  Thank you.

We were floored when we saw America's at Arizona Mills.  There's never been anything in the food court that I *wanted* to eat...yes, out of hunger, I've braved a few of the other places in there, but America's blows all of them away!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!

This is a review for the lounge: Saw flamenco dancing here on a Saturday evening. Great show. Happy hour!  Try the chips and salsa here--surprisingly good! (especially for 2 bucks!!!!) Chips were thickly cut tortilla, didn't break easily. Two kinds of salsa...verde (tomatillo) and red (I'm showing my white-ness here because I couldn't determine what kind of pepper made up the red salsa...it was nice and spicy though!).  Had the honey badger drink. Waaaaay to sweet for me. Waitress was kind enough to take it off our bill since I didn't drink it. They have some very interesting whiskey drinks on the menu that my friends ordered (and I got to taste).

when you're gluten-free, vegan, soy milk and almond milk intolerant and you can't have any caffeine, it's torture to go into any bakery or coffeehouse.  Not at Nami.  What was great about this place was the gluten-free vegan treats...yes they are sugary...my favorite is the two snickerdoodle cookies pressed together with some sort of awesome creamy goodness in the middle.  And, they can make steamers with rice or coconut milk!!!  finally a coffeehouse I feel good going to!

Amazing food!!  Is it me, or has this place gotten even better lately??  They even have a separate gluten free vegan menu, which is helpful.  LOOOVE the chili fries and the buffalo wings.  Favorites include anything with their chicken in it...the sweet and sour chicken is to die for.  LOVE that this place is next to Nami.  It's perfect...get our yums on here and then head to Nami for dessert.  The brunch is very good here as well.  Have I mentioned the buffalo wings?  oh myyyyy.

All of our family sees Dr. Harlan...this week, we took in our child. I like the doctor, which is why we go to him--very personable and professional (and a good sense of humor...you probably need that looking at feet everyday).  However, the staff...lord, what can I say? As per their usual manner, they disappointed again. This time the prescription wasn't sent to the pharmacy. Thinking that it was at the pharmacy like they said, we went to Walgreens. No luck. Then, knowing the staff's track record, we checked at CVS just in case they got confused. I emailed that evening and received a reply that they did send it to Walgreens, but not the one I requested and that they would send it again this morning. So I called Walgreens this morning. Nope--no prescription anywhere in their system. Argh.  So, I called the doc's office. The staff person I spoke was very confused that Walgreens still didn't have it and while trying to request she just send it to Melrose Pharmacy so we could stop arguing with Walgreens, she put me on hold...in the middle of a sentence. I'm sorry--but do you know how ridiculously rude that is? When I called back, a guy answered and told me brusquely that I wasn't the only patient who was waiting and needed help.  Whatthe$&):$;&&&!!!!!  Can you feel my blood boiling yet? First you cut me off. Second you don't apologize but instead blame your lousy phone manners on you being busy. Third, you then proceed to help me but make sure you seem very put out by the whole thing. Because yes, this guy did get the script to the correct pharmacy.  GEEEEEZ. I wish I could say "All's well that ends well" but...this isn't the first time I've had issues with the office staff...like not following-through with what the doctor asks.  So I'm sorry, Dr. Harlan. I really like you. But please get some more experienced staff. I told the office person I was disappointed with this last interaction would be writing this, and he said "go ahead". No apologies. Sigh.

Great group, great people, great classes!  Highly recommend getting on their mailing list and taking a class!  My most recent one was on pomegranates and the presenter was extremely knowledgeable...one of the "experts" on pomes in the valley.  I've taken classes with other groups on permaculture, but this group is by the best!!

Really didn't want to like this Subway-owned chain...who's ever heard of fast food sushi?  But I had to try.  Granted, I have NOT tried the meat/fish here.  I wouldn't.  But the make your own veggie rolls...OMG.  Finally I can get a roll with tofu, sprouts, and mango in it...or jalapeño, avocado, tofu....or sprouts, spinach, and avocado with sesame on top...you get the picture.  I LOVE vegetarian sushi.  LOVE that I can have it built my way.  LOVE that I don't get charged a fortune for it!!!!!

Amaretto flavor is delicious! Nice, old Italian folks own this joint. Flavors are unique and the selection is good. Definitely a great place to stop in and cool down! Has a few tables on the patio too.

I was expecting a better tasting breakfast...none of us really thought it was that good.  We got the potato pancakes which were bland and the frittata which was dry and very thin.  Our friend got the sausage dish and said it wasn't very flavorful despite the menu's description.  The service was good and the restaurant was cozy and clean.  Perhaps I'll give it another try at a different time so I can sample the other parts of the menu.  I love neighborhood joints...wish this one had a better breakfast.

Vegan, gluten-free, spicy decadence. It's like True Food Kitchen meets Los Dos Molinos. I'm not sure Phoenix deserves a restaurant of this quality!! This is someplace you'd find on Malibu beach...not next to Carly's.  It's definitely geared toward the young, hip crowd, but my husband, 2 yr old and I got there right around 8, so the late crowd hadn't arrived yet.  Loved all the food and especially the dessert.  I had the no whey jose tacos...so yummy...and filling! the desert was a gluten free tiramisu cupcake with turtle ice cream and chocolate sauce...we almost all died and went to heaven!  The service needs improvement for sure.  There's one guy behind the bar doing order taking and serving food and altho' we were one of two groups in there, he was hard to find at times during our meal!  (it's spicy, so hey, pour me some more water bro!)  when he saw i was taking pics, i could have sworn his service got better...lol.  The food was sooooooo good though, that I just can't take away a star for the service.  I hope it gets better tho'!

Although I am not permanently disabled, my injuries make going to the regular gym an experience in pain and embarrassment.  This place, affectionately called Spofit by its staff and members, CATERS to those of us with limitations.  There's yoga, water aerobics, an indoor running track, two basketball courts, a climbing wall, a room of weights and machines, two pools and a hot tub...and it's KID friendly.  There are lots of planned activities for the little ones and there's always the pool!  The two pools are kept warmer than average, but the smaller pool is called the therapy pool and goes from 3 to 6 feet, perfect for doing my warm up exercises!  The staff is always friendly, easy to talk with and ready to help.  You'll never feel un-able at this gym...you'll always feel surrounded by people who are moving and exercising at their own pace in a non-competitive and supportive environment.  If you have a personal care assistant, that person can come free to the gym to help you.  The membership rates are very good with NO contracts!  But you can always come in for a day pass or try your first visit for free.  $25 a month for individuals, $60/month for families with up to 6 people on your membership.  The showers and changing rooms are gigantic and always spotless.  Also, if you want Watsu, AquaStretch or even help with crafting a workout plan, there are lots of opportunities for that too!  The only drawback is the hours...limited on the weekend...they're only open Saturday from 9-2 and not open on Sunday, M-F 6:30am to 9pm.

I love coming here for their creatively delicious monthly specials. The ice cream is Thrifty brand, which I love...less cream, so it's great when you're adding all kinds of toppings and flavors. It's also the kind that most ice cream shops have been using for decades. And, it's a kid favorite. They have over a dozen flavors, but it's the combinations that really make Bertie's special! Their baked foods are made in-house and there are always whoopie pies on the counter.  Love the vintage thrift store in this place and the ambiance of the old movies or music playing next to the counter.

Oh so in love with this place! Boba taro tea (vegan)! Shaved ice is a healthy and delicious alternative to ice cream. And with all the Asian toppings available, it's a perfect place for kids and adults to try something new like mochi balls!  Clean and service is fast and friendly. We like the assortment of games that you can play there with the kids or your date. Especially like the fighting robots!!! Fun!

Beer, football and an awesome sandwich. Sounds like this is heaven for a bunch of men that I know. The interior is like half Subway and half sports bar.  I've only had the veggie sub sandwiches...the veggie cole turkey is one of my favorite sub sandwiches ever, but ask for no mayo on it or the mayo in the cole slaw and the mayo and Russian dressing they put on it will over-mayo the sandwich.  I thought for awhile that the Bobbie could be made veggie, but technically, the stuffing is made with a meat broth, so nope. I suppose you could get it without the stuffing...cuz who doesn't love cranberry sauce on their fake turkey? It's definitely worth a try. Yum!  The veggie steak and cheese is good too if you're in the mood for a warm sub...definitely add the peppers to it to make the chewyness of the fake meat fade into the chewyness of the peppers. It helps, trust me.  Overall, these are great subs. If I want a sub sandwich, I come here. There's nowhere else that has good veggie meat options like these!!

As I'm writing this, all three of us who ate here are moaning in pain. One has gas pains, I have stomach pains and my last friend has a headache. This place is the worst sushi we've ever had. Too much mayo and Krab in the rolls, bland sashimi, not much selection. However, it was dirt cheap. We got what we paid for. Ugh. I actually hope I vomit.  36 hours later: never vomited unfortunately. After going to bed with stomach pains, I woke up with indigestion (a "sour stomach") around 4 am. At 4:45, the insanity started--I don't think I've ever had diarrhea like this. I had to lay down close to the bathroom because it was coming out so fast and often.  Next day: diarrhea stopped after taking activated charcoal but the stomach pains and indigestion are STILL HAPPENING. I don't feel good. I'm going to the doctor...maybe she can help.   --------------- After eating here and 10 days of abdominal cramping, diarrhea and indigestion, my stool test returned positive for a PARASITE--Dientamoeba fragilis! You get it from swallowing contaminated feces--in other words, someone working here and preparing food is carrying the parasite and didn't wash their hands. I have to take an antibiotic/parasitic called Flagyl.   --------------- 6 weeks later: I'm on my second round of anti-parasitic drugs (the first round didn't get rid of the parasite completely). I had to order the current medication from Mexico because it's not sold in the U.S. It's called Diodoquin, aka, iodoquinol. It's a common medicine to give in other countries but not here in the U.S. because getting a parasite is not thought to be that common. Perhaps one of the employees who has been to another country recently is infected?  So far, I've spent $580 on doctor's visits, medicines and stool testing so it's not cheap sushi anymore. Take your chances if you want, but all of us got sick. I just happened to end up with the worst reaction. If you want good (safe) sushi, go somewhere else.

Vegetable tacos are so delicious! I've only had them vegan, but you can get them with cheese. We get them with the hot sauce...goes well with the pickled cabbage in the taco. YUM! (Meat-eaters in our family say the hamburgers are very good....but I have no direct experience!) Fries are crispy and I like the salt AND pepper on them.  Now for dessert...the shakes are so good that I have stopped getting them. The salted caramel was so amazing that I was craving it and finding reasons to stop there more than once a week and get one. And my behind does not need any extra shakes!! Try one if you've got some extra calories left.

OMG, this place is so so so so so yummy...and there's a line out the door for it on the weekends that I just can't force myself to stand in, otherwise I'd be there more often! I had one of the eggs bennie and one of their dessert-like pancakes. So delicious. Great for kids. Love the booths!

Plus-size resale shop...thank goodness someone has finally created a place like this! Found some great shirts and cardigans. They even had some tall plus size jeans, which is super rare! Most of their clothes were in the larger range...like 16 and up, but it depends on what people bring in since they're a resale boutique. They sell shoes, belts, and clothing as well as some cool jewelry.  So clean out that closet, girl!! You're sure to find something in there that you can trade up!  ****Only open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday!*****

Love them in the food truck...pub, not so much. Went two times. My kid and husband both RAVE about the mac and cheese, but since I'm not a cheese fan, I haven't had it. I've only eaten the pizza and I have not been impressed.  Last time, I ordered the vegan Mexican pizza. It was so bland and tasteless that I asked for hot sauce to douse it in. The server said they had none...so it went back to the kitchen because I'm not a fan of eating cardboard. He still charged us for it. I paid $10 for a bite of a terrible pizza. I won't be back!  Also, fyi, if you sit in the main bar area near a speaker, prepare to lose some of your hearing. They blast the music.

Wonderful, unique, delicious flavors. Ice creams are rich and creamy...good quality ingredients made in house like their handmade marshmallows! Their salted caramel is popular and always in the case, but new flavors circulate often and change based on what's in season.   The sorbets are equally amazing as the ice creams. At most ice cream joints, sorbet is like the red-headed stepchild. Here, they've put equally as much thought into the sorbets as the ice cream and it shows. The cantaloupe flavor and the basil lime are my favorites.  Open late for after dinner cravings...10p, 11p depending on the day. There are pre-filled pints in the freezer by the register ready for taking back to your couch to curl up with a movie.

Definitely NOT a good place for vegetarians. Very meat-oriented menu; rice is cooked in pork stock, but the black beans are not. Salsas in their "salsa flight" are almost all puréed except the cucumber pico which just seemed like cut up cucumber and not a lot else. Guacamole was too lemony and wasn't freshly made.  I ordered a shrimp burrito without cheese. Presentation was nice but there was only pork-rice, shrimp, cheese inside. It was disappointing. Not only was it made wrong with cheese, but it was boring...flavorless and dry. I'd recommend this place if you're a gringo who likes flavorless food but not to anyone who actually likes flavorful or spicy dishes.

Never thrown away falafel, so this place was a new low for me. I had the falafel platter...there weren't many falafels (4) and they were terrible. Tasted more like hushpuppies.  The side salad (Greek, I guess) was covered with a shredded cheese of some kind (maybe feta?) but there was way too much of it...cheese with a side of lettuce. Hardly any red onion or tomato on it.  I really wanted to like this place--and perhaps it is good for meat eaters because of the supposedly giant proportions but we won't go back. It was the worst falafel I've ever tasted.

Came here on recommendation from a friend and so glad I did. I thought I was mostly buying pops for my kid, but I ended up eating most of them myself (oops) and then going back 2 days later to restock!  They have a lot of great flavors like salted caramel and strawberries n cream and the usual smattering of chocolate pops. You can even have your pop dipped in chocolate and covered with nuts or cookie bits.  But I honestly liked some of the more unique flavors the best--strawberry balsamic, cucumber watermelon, and passion fruit pineapple. Those are unique flavor combinations I've never tasted before in a dessert and definitely worth a try.  They also have samples for you to try...which means you can find your favorite pop before buying.  Pops are $3 each or $25 for 10. They have a groupon right now too that's $5 off if you spend a certain amount. Try not to eat all your pops in one night! They're hard to resist!

Best primary care doctor experience EVER in my entire life. I have some "complicated" health problems but the doctor here at One Medical listened patiently and attentively while I explained everything. She did a physical exam during my first appointment (it's covered by my insurance for free once a year) and literally spent 45 minutes with me! When is the last time that happened to you at the doctor's office?!?! Never, right?  Once the physical exam was out of the way, we talked about ways to address my health questions/issues and she said she would follow up with me by email with some suggestions. Whaaaaat? My doctor emailing me?!? Thinking it would be a short email with one suggestion, I was totally surprised when the doctor wrote me a very long email with over a dozen suggestions! Wow!  Fast forward to now, after several visits with my new doc, I feel completely taken care of...I email her when I need a referral or when I have an update on my health that I feel like sharing. I don't feel ignored or dismissed in any way as I so often did with my other primary care doctors. So much of my time was spent going in to those doctor offices begging to get a blood test that I thought might enlighten a new way to treat my chronic condition or begging to try a new drug that might help me sleep. But I've never had to beg or plead here. I just tell my doc what I've researched and get the tests. When she hasn't heard about the research I've seen, she looks it up! She's even printed medical journal articles out for me.  So what can I say? It was worth every penny to join here has a member. This is how primary care SHOULD be. You should feel GREAT about your relationship with your doctor--SAFE to talk to them and TRUST that they have both your best interest at heart. They should trust that you are being HONEST with them if you have reactions to drugs or have a feeling that something might be going on with your health and they should take that seriously--not dismiss it! And that's the relationship I now have with my doctor--finally!  The specific doctor I see here is Dr. Siri Chand Khalsa. She is very kind and compassionate. And, she is willing to think "outside the box" because she has both an MD and training in alternative medicine.  A few other fantastic things about this office: An app where you can get treated any time of the day--they have PAs and docs on staff 24/7 who can even send a prescription in if you need it. It's easy to schedule appointments...even same day or next day...either by phone or in the app. In-house labs and tests. A peaceful, comfortable waiting room. And, appointments actually start ON TIME!
