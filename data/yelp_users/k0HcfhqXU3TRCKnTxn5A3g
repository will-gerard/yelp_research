Only place I trust for hand wash! Reasonably priced for a prestigious wash! They also honor all coupons from Yelp for full service. I've always left here satisfied with the service my on vehicle and customer service received by staff.   They go soon and beyond on customer service, as I sit here writing this review a service member walked through the door with an elderly customer on his arm helping her in and let me add carrying her purse in his other hand.  Los Olivos also has a shoe shining service available for all those that are stopping by during lunch from work.

Love coming here for lunch and dinner! Perfect for a lunch hour and good options to choose from and now offer pizza during lunch time. Absolutely love going here for dinner and the ambiance is so cozy and relaxing. Also love the fact that they have live music playing in the evenings

So impressed! Was able to have an MRI and follow up same day. Staff went out of their way to accommodate needs as I live on other side of town. Excellent communications from doctors office upstairs and MRI scanning downstairs. I am impressed by their customer service

This location has recently been taken over by new owners and I am highly offended and will not be going to this barber shop. This is extremely unfortunate considering my whole family which is four individual families with kids all see Reggie there and he is a great barber and one of my nephews is delayed and haircuts are a challenge for him. However, Reggie has been seeing him for 3yrs now and he is not only great with my nephew but understanding due to his delay. Today the new manager addressed my brother in law asking him, "is your son autistic?" Which engaged in a conversation with my brother in law saying, that due to a liability my nephew can no longer go to this shop. This is not only a direct attack but also discrimination!! I will most certainly be reporting him to the BBB. With management like this you will certain to loss tons of business

I love Dutch bros and especially this particular location!! They are genuine and enjoy their job and it shows. They make you feel welcome and are upbeat every visit. I am so happy they have ventured out to the west side of the valley

I am completely in love with this place! They not only make the best tacos and burritos but el chino beans are to die for! I now have a true food addiction to this place and go a few times a week. They also offer turkey and chicken options if you don't eat red meat, which is a plus!! You leave craving more and without the feeling your pores are oozing grease. This is quality food and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I look forward to each visit and their staff is always so welcoming and accommodating. This place is a MUST stop and so reasonably priced as well

I was not impressed by this place at all. Extremely overpriced for the portion you receive. You pretty much are paying for the ambiance is all. The service was very slow considering they only had three tables in the entire restaurant. The presentation was nice, however, they at baby servings ... I am still hungry

Opening day is finally here!!! This line is about a mile long but I don't mind  I have been impressed with all the locations on the west valley, so I am certain this will be no different. They have great coordination considering it's opening day and have all the vehicles lined up nicely through this business complex and staff is walking around handing out menus and pins :) so excited for this location!! Support the local spots
