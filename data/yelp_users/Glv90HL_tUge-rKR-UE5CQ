Meh, not the "best" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale.

This place sucks. Food has gone downhill majorly. Fun for drinking. Bad for food

Made reservations and were seated very quickly, The food is very good. However, we had an unexpected visitor. After finishing dinner we watched a cockroach crawl out from under a table and proceeded across the floor of the dining room. We pointed this out to a staff member who "stepped on" the roach and went to retrieve a napkin and plastic glove. Upon returning he picked up the deceased and disposed of it. We were shocked. The manager apologized and stated that although he has seen crickets, Never a cockroach? So, Meh. Think will skip this Palace of roaches.

We were here to watch Ice Age 4, Usually we go to Scottsdale 101 Cine Capri. However, Once we left our son forgot his wallet. We called and they looked in the theater, to our surprise they found the wallet and everything was in tact. Four stars for  a trustworthy business and also the quick response.

Was visiting this establishment often until our last visit on Friday. Usually we're here for there happy hour. Very small happy hour menu with the regular stuff, pizza,Cesar salad, and artichoke dip. They were understaffed and after having to wait 20+ mins just for the check. Well, never again. Cool spot, horrible service.

Salads/Sandwich's are decent/Good, Desserts are what makes them stand-out. The wait during rush hour (lunch) is a joke. Feel's like a grade school cafeteria line. Guys/Gals with there briefcases who need too much room and think there overly important. And the best part you ask? The parking lot is a cluster, And with this location being so busy you think Paradise would come to there senses and move to a more suitable/larger building. Also, only two stars because price wise should be cheaper IMO

Recently pinnacle grille has deteriorated. Living close to this restaurant made it our go to, however the last visit sealed the deal and we will not return. Ordered dinner as usually with a calamari appetizer, the calamari was cold ( partial frozen) and we made this obvious to are waiter who acted unconvinced. The owner who was present completely ignored us and we actually had to request to the waiter that we would not pay for the appetizer when the bill arrived. Pinnacle grille needs better ownership/management/waiters. For now will drive further into town to enjoy a consistent meal with actual owners that care.

I found TMTT through fellow Yelper's and was satisfied. Rather then having my wife's new car done at our residence, I opted to have done at there shop in Tempe. Shannon was great and although forgetting to mention they would not warranty the tint over existing tint  (New car and wasn't sure). She took the vehicle in and removed tint/Added desired darkness.

First time was not great, Tried again and definitely nothings changed. Hard rice/ small rolls/crap happy hour. The best is Shaggy preparing the sushi. WTF, Really a young white dude?  The two stars is for the waitress who was by herself and obviously trying. Meh, I'm gonna skip and head to Stingray or Toyama.
