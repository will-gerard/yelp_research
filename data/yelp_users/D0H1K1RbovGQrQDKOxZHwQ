Will never order from this dominos. I usually love dominos pizza but the past 4 times ive order at this location the pizza has been undercooked (to the point its still  pizza dough) last time i finally called them and all the girl on the other end could say is "we go by the timer"...

Terrible pharmacy! Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions. And even when it's been their fault their answer is "once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much. From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again.

McDonalds has burgers with more flavor then this place...  Literally no taste to it... And the "bacon" looked more like bits of vomit... Graphic yes but that's all that could come to mind after attempting to eat this thing. Just say no.... Trust me your off going to McDonalds, Burger King... Or Wendy's and Ordering from the $1 menu.

Terrible... Tasted like bad frozen food and only made my stomach toss and turn the rest of the night. Will never order here again.

I take my girlfriend here all the time and she always walks out happy. We go here at least every two weeks, even get myself a manicure. Highly recommend it!

Very professional and knowledgeable. Spoke woth the manger there who actually took the time to explain everything how best to optimise your wookout, supplements everything. Very impressed. Of course you could find all your sbit cheeper online but without the knowledge base your money is wasted. Quality over quantity.
