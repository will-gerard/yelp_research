Read the wonderful reviews and thought I'd check this place out. I'm sure they do an amazing job and maybe I came in at the wrong time but I'm very sensitive to smell. I wasn't in there for longer than 5 minutes and just had to get out. It had that acetone or which ever chemical they use to give that "nail salon" smell. It was extremely strong. Like I said, I'm sure they do a good job but I couldn't stay long enough to find out.

Absolutely love this place. Had the embellished spa pedicure and enjoyed every minute of it and my feet feel & look amazing. Also had a gel manicure and Alicia did a great job of making it look like the picture I brought in.

Went here because of their rating and all the nice designs. Well, I brought in my own matte color and wanted to see if they could do the roses I saw on their photos. The lady who helped me was very nice but doesn't do designs. She asked another lady and she said it has to be gel and I said I don't want gel. Then she said she would "try" it. After the shaping and trimming I asked the lady helping me if it's just better to have the 2 nails the other lady was going to try the roses on as gel, I wouldn't mind then. Apparently that wasn't possible, cause she asked some other lady and then told me next time and I asked why? Apparently the lady who knows how to do the designs had to leave to pick up her kids and she'll be back in 30 min. (Keep in mind there's still 3 ladies there) As nice as they were, I will not return. If it's a nail salon, and you have all these pictures and posts on your website, social media, and your own TV, you should have more than 1 person who is able to do these designs

Every time I come here they are always out of clams  it's best to call ahead to make sure what you're coming here for is available.
