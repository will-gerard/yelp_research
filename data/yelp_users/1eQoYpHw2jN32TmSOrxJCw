This review is for the Eye exam center inside of Lenscrafters at AZ mills I went in for an eye glass exam and specifically requested to be fitted for eye glasses. They fit me for contacts and then when I requested AGAIN for my glasses prescription the doctor became irritated with me and said "Fine if you're going to argue with me I'll do your glasses exam but if it's not accurate when you get your glasses there's no refunds." He told his assistant to hurry up because it's busy Saturdays. He proceeded with my eye exam rushed and the rest of the exam was blurry and inaccurate. Dr.Irene finished the exam in a sloppy manner and almost guaranteed me my prescription would be inaccurate.

My appointment was at 8 and the Doctor didn't come into my room until about 8:45. When he came in he asked if I was still doing the treatment he prescribed a year before. I said no, and explained I went off the oral antibiotics because I try to stay away from putting too many chemicals in my body. He asked if I was using the face wash they sell there (the Aracadia Benzaderm wash). I said I used it for about 7 months and it stopped working for my breakouts. He became irritated and said I still need to use that and gave me some topical gel samples and left. This was all under 2 minutes. I took time off work and paid a 40$ copay to have the dermatologist prescribe me a facewash I already tried and didn't work and then to get a couple of sample topical gels. Not even a prescription for the topical gels. He wanted me to come back in 3 weeks to see how it was working, so I could pay another 40$ copay. Then I asked the assistant if there was any type of cream she recommended I put on my face to prevent scarring for the breakouts and she said no. There's nothing I could do to help the scarring except go through their skin peel laser treatments they offered at out of pocket costs. I felt like my experience there was less than impressive. He didn't ask me anything about my lifestyle, diet, hormones, or anything that might be causing my breakouts. To me, it seemed like all they cared about was promoting and selling their own products.

Went for a first time Brazilian. I was pretty nervous but the atmosphere was calming and Lisa was great at creating conversation and keeping my mind off the wax. She was so quick and professional , I'll definitely be going back in the future!

I always took my GTI to Tuning Gruppe and never ever got the run around from them. They were always incredibly helpful and explained every issue to me, in addition to showing me the problems. I always recommend them to everyone I know. Very trustworthy. Check em out!

Great beer selection, warm atmosphere, ping pong, giant jenga, Odell, New Belgium, beer garden,and more! What else could you want in a bar? I studied abroad and had the chance to go to a couple German restaurants that had beer gardens, and this restaurant definitely brought back those memories. It's a close second to the real thing.

I love this place, each time I've been I've tried a new drink and entree and have been impressed. Excellent vegetarian options too! Iced toddy has been my favorite so far.

Great service, reasonable prices , and an excellent variety of Spanish dishes. I also enjoyed the local beer selection. There's a couple of delicious vegetarian options (not your ordinary salad and veggie burger options either).  I am anxious to go back again.

I love coming here for my manicures. The hot towel treatment at the end is my favorite!
