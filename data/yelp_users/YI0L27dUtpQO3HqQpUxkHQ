Barb's takes me back to childhood memories of my father taking me to a couple of his favorite sweet spots which were great then but can't compare to the goodies that come from here. My favorite is the bear claw filled with sweet cinnimon and topped with a drizzle of white icing and almonds. My girlfriend's favorite is the rasberry and cheese danish. The pastry is a light buttery flavorful compliment to the fresh rasberry flavor. My mouth is waterying just describing it! Be sure to stop by on Saturday's before 9 a.m. at the latest to be able to choose from a wide selction of pastries, cookies, mini cakes (like the red velvet cake). Mmmm. I also like that coffee and milk is available on the spot if you can't wait to savor the yummy deliciousness!

Living in the West Valley, options for locally owned bakeries are slim pickings. However, this would be worth the drive if I didn't live near by. The bear claws are freshly baked with a rich almond paste center and always on point. Also, there are some almond bar treats (I'm not sure what the proper name is) that are our go to pastry. I have also had the fruit danish and some of the cookie selections, never disappointed here!

My first visit was intended to be a weekend afternoon of appetizer's and cocktails. After reviewing the selections on the happy hour menu, it was easy to see that choosing "one" option was not going to be easy. We started with the wild salmon croquettes with a lemon caper beurre blanc sauce and the vegetarian tostadas and at the suggestion of our server the white and red wine sangrias. While a favorite here is difficult to choose, I would have to say the croquettes are at the top of my list. The tostadas are made of small fried tortillas with a guacamole spread was served with veggies and cheese, and topped with a chipotle aioli. By the time all was said and done, we had spent a greater part of the afternoon sampling the happy hour menu and ending it with the chocolate ancho chile torte, one of my favorite desserts of all time. For dinner, if you enjoy a spicier dish, you might try the green chile corn bread casserole. It is a great balance of sweet and spicy that I can't resist!   The atmosphere and staff are both welcoming making this one of my favorite downtown local spots.

I will have to admit that because of the location and unfamiliarity of it, I was somewhat apprehensive about trying Los Reyes de la Torta. Now, I am so glad I did. This Mexico City style Mexican food was not only tasty but 1 Torta would have been more than two people with a good appetite could eat. I had the Torta Del Rey, filled with beef, pork, ham, chorizo, cheese, a fried egg, and then topped with avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, and jalapeno. At first I thought it was an unusual combination but I was wrong, it was very flavorful. I will definitely have that again!   The location is in a small strip mall and parking is limited. This is a great neighborhood restaurant and the price is more than reasonable!

I feel like locally owned business with a great menu and wine selction can be hard to come by in the West Valley. However, this spot is right on par. I have had everything from the brick oven pizza's (Bianca and Mediterranean, eggplant parmesean to something not on the menu, baked spaghetti and cannoli's. The quality of the food and the price can't be beat!

This is in a great location in central phoenix near the light rail and Heritage Square. It is a smaller British themed pub. My girlfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday to partake in an afternoon of football and drinks. It was a great balance for us since I enjoy the fruitier, lighter drinks like the $3 mimosa's, while my girlfriend sipped on the reasonably priced import brews. Inside it was sectioned into 4 different areas to include two bar style seating areas, a game room of sorts and a dinning room all centered around T.V.'s. It was great for watching the game we went to watch and keeping tabs of the other teams playing. The staff was accommodating and changed the T.V. to one of the less popular games at our request. I sunk into a big leather chair near a window facing the outdoor area of the pub. There was outdoor games and BBQ in celebration of the afternoon games. While I'm not really a football fan, the staff and atmosphere made my afternoon not only bearable, but enjoyable!

We have been here a few times for drinks and more recently for the fish and chips. It was good and I loved the fact that they allowed my dog and I to sit on the patio. A huge plus!! The service is good and friendly.

One of my friends recommended this place for a sushi spot in downtown Phoenix near the light rail. The location is south of the Roosevelt and I must have driven by it many times. I enjoyed the bar seating which allowed me to view all of the house specialties of which I will be back to try. For starters I had the spicy salmon served in baby greens, cucumber, avocado, radish sprouts, seaweed in spicy creamy dressing presented in a martini style glass. It was delicious! Since I love to sample, we ordered a few different rolls and some sashimi as well. The spicy yellowtail was delicious and fresh. My favorite was the volcano, with crab meat and a crispy outter shell and volcano sauce on top. I had a sake that I have not been able to find anywhere else. If you're a fan of sake, the must have here is the Shirakabe Gira. Overall, this place was delicious although a little pricey. I think the quality would justify the expense.

I am so excited to see Carolina's in the West Valley. There are not many places that I can enjoy Mexican food on my side of town and the price is right. You can tell by the long lines that we have been needing it for a while. Get there early on Saturday for Menudo cause they are usually out by 9:30.

I'll start by saying when it comes to Mexican food, I'm fairly particular since no one can cook like my Nana. The menu is simple with just a few basic selections. I have tried the carne asada tacos, the Vampiro Pastor and by far my flavor of choice here is the Torta-Pastor. I also sampled America's corn which I was somewhat disappointed in. For what it is, the prices are a little high. Seating is somewhat limited to mostly outdoor seating cooled by misters which tends to be too warm in the summer months here but they intice you by offering $2 Corona and Tecate. ATS on 7th Ave is great in a pinch.

This has been a hard year for many business' and it especially shows here. I haven't gone as much as I used to since it seemed like each time they were out of something. This is an issue considering the menu is already limited. My most recent and last visit, there was almost no meat on my torta. We ordered some chips and guacomole with our food and it was just enough to feel satisfied, but over priced since it lacked meat.

I have purchased two vehicles from Damon here. Damon is a great sales person. He was able to assess our needs and provide us exactly what we asked for. The Service Department on the other hand is another story. I have had to take each of my vehicles back for service. Even if you make an appointment, you are not guaranteed to be serviced at your scheduled time. Most recent experience was today. An appointment was made to service the Jeep Patriots transmission after it failed during a road trip. Not something you would expect on a two year old vehicle. An appointment was scheduled and when I arrived, I was advised the diagnostic would not be complete until the end of the day. Additionally, no loaners are provided. None of this information was provided at the time the appointment was scheduled. That would have been helpful to allow me to make other arrangements. Or perhaps select another dealership. Additionally, they are rude and unprofessional. I will continue to post the progress of my repair.
