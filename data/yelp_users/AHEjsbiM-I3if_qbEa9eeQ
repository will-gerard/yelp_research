Not on my list for a quick return. Had been several years since my last one, so most likely will not be revisited unless the crew decides it's a must do. Sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying. Cut them off or fix them.

I can usually find what I need! But checking out seems "my Lowe's" isn't a priority for them here - thus my advice keep your receipt!!! They're whole idea is a buyer purchase tracking so they can better meet their regional / local markets and yet they cannot manage to bring fourth what they spent millions advertising as a benefit to their customers yet help them better manage their products offered.

Service has always been good. Food experience is sporadic, meaning it goes from ok to fair most of the time. Not overly impressed it's not the chili's of old. When their roots began with the trelingua tx chili cook off. The experience is fair at best and very seldom bad. Just not any thing more for me than a bar with fast food.

Service good, poured out my ranch dressing to find something mysterious in it - appeared to be a food item like a piece of crust of something. Told server took very light of it as did I having worked in the business. Meaning I wasn't trying to make a big deal out of it. But the thing that should've occurred was for the server to tell management and have them acknowledge the incident. I will most likely speak with a manager before I leave - then maybe not.

Okay here's how it goes! The ED lacks a lot - organization lacks the ability to effectively manage guests and triage them. Their lack of compassion WOW! Was here myself in October 2013 the ED DOESN'T move with any urgency! Now let's keep this short, the cafe food hurts meaning REALLY BAD!!!

This is a tough one anti pasta salad was fair at best! Calzone is Hugh but was cold in center after 30 min wait. Service was not there; waiter walked by us so many times that I lost count and I still needed a refill. It wasn't him that got the refills for us. Not bad food not the best, it's the service that really hurts here!! Maybe some one would want to work a split shift. Just not a good experience. I love to tip good service this was zero service and only will return if someone just has to visit! I've been here probably five times and service has always been a notable issue! Waiter paid a ton of attention to a couple sitting at the bar! Probably not their desired outcome for our visit but it is that. I did speak with a manager and addressed my observations and concerns! Good luck give it a shot!!

Only because to rate I have to give a star! The place is usually clean in appearance, but service is horrible. I guess the lack of effort is innate to this establishment. Have spoken with manager and it remains to be the same. I know there are other places but the person bowling bowling on a league.

Being consistent is a key, went again after the review written below and this time I ordered the Taco's Al carbon and they were a little tough so I take a star away from my original evaluation because I want it to be the same every visit. If you ask me to go back....Oh yes. Mexican cuisine - Let's start with our waiter, Javier awesome job and his interaction with us (4) was great. The top shelve guacamole was made at the table and was good and the food was very good.. There had been some changes to old items on the menu (good changes that enhanced the product).  New menu items which I choose to try which I enjoyed..I'll leave it up to you to choose your new favorite food.

I've always have had consistent quality with service and food. The rolls are delicious. Not anything to critique; background music is up beat to help motivate patrons to get in and out! Atmosphere is more relaxed than the pace of lunch service. I need to come back for a dinner service and see what pace they have at that time! Anyway a good meal, little on the $$$ till you see the portions (soup and salad combo).

I increased the stars by 2, I have to say this is one of my top choices for a nice evening out and special occasions - one of the things I do like is the seasonal menus and the fact that the menu challenges me to try new tastes.  Service is spot on and already thinking when will be my next evening at the Cork.    Have eaten here once and we're making another visit this evening and we're hoping it is as good if not better this visit.  Last time was good the menu online was not up to date so wasn't ready for the current menu they had.  Enjoyed the meal and the service was good just was disappointed that the menu wasn't current.  I think that is a big mistake on the part of the restaurant.  Like I said hoping that the menu currently posted is the one that I'll be choosing and eating from tonight.

I agree with the rating as far as the bbq pork flat bread, where's the pork????? Service wasn't badbut wasn't the friendliest! Not that busy had no host at the door but not long wait. But just a very indifferent feel to the place. Glad it's all the way on the other side of Phx from where I live! Only will return with a group if I cannot convince them to go else where!

Service was good! And I had to slow myself down! The tea glasses had partials stuck to them. Then my salad plate was very questionable- if the dishwasher is working properly with its sterilization everything should be fine, but you have to ? If it's working properly. Then my salad bowl showed similar issues. Ordered the chicken critter salad I've had multiple times here and the Temperature of the chicken varies, sometimes hot, sometimes cold. When I asked the waitress, it was explained I got cold chicken because of the other meal taking so long. Oh, did I mention it did take quite awhile from order to the time  food was delivered to the table. I'm going to have to put the place back on the bottom of where to eat. May let the party I'm with eat here and I'll go to the other place just across the way! I did speak with a supervisor, then had a longer one as we left. It is one place I hadn't had a bad experience in a long while.

Little slow to get to me sitting at the bar, but was greeted from a far! The bartender was busy but very good! Had the Mexican chopped w/ chicken just as well had something more exciting! It was good but no calories saved on the salad. I would encourage the business not to cut the chicken so small you barely know you have any. SLICE THE MEAT!! That's what really made this a four star vs five star. Michalata yeah!  NO CLAM JUICE yeahhhh!!!! So glad to find a good michalata one made without the clam juice clams ruin the beer! In the old days a bloody beer, but the michalata has flare and great taste sort of a Bloody Mary with a beer but drank together (make sure no clams involved) !

Service excellent Mariah was awesome. Food was great! To bad the manager was into checking with his guest! He liked to hang put at the counter talking with cooks and service team. Didn't catch that the waitress dropped something on floor and didn't wash her hands - right in front of him. He was more in the way, standing in the pickup area - not expediting! Food is pricey but it is good! It's rich man's pizza.

Really not sure but since I cannot give 1/2 stars I rated them with two stars. Service started out okay, but felt like we were slighted after we started off on the wrong foot as it seems. We had been given a groupon as a gift, so was determined to chill and enjoy a nice meal and forgive some of the things I would normally hold a restaurant accountable for. Well, that wasn't the case; after calling 3 times to attempt to make a reservation - I was told all three times none needed. The first thing I was asked by the hostess was, "I'll let you guess!" You're right "DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION?" Service was barely given, had to almost beg for refill on Tea, food lacked flavor, the shrimp were tough, pricey for the portion, SALAD WAS GOOD! Desert was good! Guest next to us upset because they'd driven quite a distance to learn that the restaurant was closed for remodel, but was serving in the lobby of the hotel. Lot of reviews out there for these guys, I'd only return if I was in a group and that is where they want to go. Always worth a shot, you may have a better experience, I'd only hope!!

Lunch time slow few people came in while there. Nice place! Music could go down a notch or two! Service greeted and walked to the table pretty much right away - just happened waitress was walking by. Waitress was okay pretty knowledgeable. Had not checked with me since order was delivered even just took order for table in front of me. Instead of a step to check she turned and walked away! Tried the Asian salad here as the other store don't remember the seaseme seeds at the other store. ONE THING FOR SURE: never saw peanuts on the table. Not so sure of the plastic dog bowls for the peanuts - maybe stainless ones would be a little classier! But I have to say Beer was cold as was the glass. Really didn't feel welcomed by my waitress seemed like much rather be else where. I've written all of the above and just now got back to my table " now it wasn't how was everything it was (another beer) while clearing my plate. Again food fair, service was medium at best!  Okay waitress came from backside to slide beer on table and not even to say "HERE YA GO!" - if I hadn't said thank you she wasn't going to say a word! Should see a manager stopping and asking about everything (NONE)! A place such as this has to be about FRIENDLY! I really do like the place little travel but would give another chance!

Slow to no service after order was taken. Ordered a hamburger wow let's just say bun was toasted but cold and stale. The meat was medium on the bottom of the patty so makes me wonder if they bake it like they do their fries. The place lacks air conditioning, a room ac vented into the space above the ceiling. You can give the place a try, that's your call. If the place lacks the proper equipment they need to find their niche, maybe it's breakfast.

Not sure why I came back, being there were only 9 people in the place seems that they lack a lot - based on what I see not a lunch time destination! Due to lack of people hard to go wrong on beer - wait I could be wrong! This place to have survived must be on a night time audience.

Service was fine! House salads are extremely small! The crab avocado stack is very bland tasting. The chips served with the stack are thin so they break trying to eat the stack. So, pull out the fork and spoon it onto your chips. Not my go to place as a rule. My big thing today was the 45 minute wait when I saw a minimum of five tops. Then as I got ready to leave I found out I was wrong! It was a whole section; minimum of 10 tops not being used and no manager to be found (usually can spot them running around. Hasn't ever been a great experience, but not bad enough to not try again.

I recommend checking yelp for feedback on this one! Ordered surf and turf burrito - good idea bad execution. Carne Asada w/ shrimp (fried) should be grilled little more al fresco. Not recommending this at all and ordering drive through is a pain!!

Not sure what to think of the place comments are older now. Ran into the girl that owns/runs the place. It had seemed to be closed she was wearing one of their shirts and made some comment off the wall seemingly in reference to not being much longer before they closed their doors. Went in small group of people - quite crowd! Not very friendly place I guess you're somewhat of a regular. Not a place I come to often nor will I!

Kind of saw that it was 3.5 stars and thought a new experience would be nice.  WOW! wrong it was an experience I will not be doing again.  Ordered the Prime Rib (Special for Saturday NIght) very tough and lots of fat.  Ordered Medium and it was more rare.  Using a serrated steak knife to attempt to cut the meat it was more of tearing the meat.  Good taste but poor quality meat.  The shrimp pan fried on the other had was excellent.  If the owners really want this to be the go to steak house they've got some work ahead; both the product being served and the service.  While I saw some excellent service at the table next to us, the service that we received was ok to fair at best.  There appeared to be a gentleman that was either manager or owner but only stood in the door and not once did I see him mingle with the guest.  I wish he had I would have love to share my feed back with him if he was either the afore mentioned.This place at best is a want to be fine steak house.

This review is being written after several visits at various times. This is a fair place for grabbing a bite to eat. There are definite areas that can be improved upon.  The reviews here at yelp are like a roller coaster.  There is somewhat of a theme "western with Sexy Cowgirls"; but then there is I want to be a biker bar twist.  I like the "Sexy Cowgirl and the owner should focus on that theme. The girls like to visit "the regulars", not the new Customers, they get lost in conversation and seem upset because they have to serve someone else besides their regular Customer (who knows that person could become a regular customer).The owner does this to, he'll walk right by new Customer's to talk to regulars and not even as much as a quick stop to say hi and see if everything was good. This place with some tweaks with the menu and product and the overall attitude of the staff this place could be an awesome destination for the many potential new Customers. Changed the name of the place, dressed the staff different but left a few crumbs on the table that if taken care of could be a good destination for a nice burger and/or wings. And of course an exlir of your choosing.

Really simple order and they were way off simple fries w/ garlic Parmesan missed by a mile!!! To little to say about a bad thing!!  Beer taste old!!!!!! Wow people rate this bar way to high Less really if you want to know overall my true experience you should call me! I've reviewed many restaurants and bars and my reviews always start with "I'm looking for success!" My experience doesn't bias me it actually the honest feed back that you get from me that the CUSTOMERS THAT WALK OUT TO NEVER COME BACK!!

Manager on duty was around but never visited a table when times are slow great time to interact wit Customers. Had the Chile lime grilled chicken was good, cucumbers were a little thick cut. Wanted to really give 4 stars, but the bartender/waiter wasn't that attentive left me having to waive him down for refill even though my glass was almost empty. One of my sauces was empty and he never even offered to refresh. Brought the check turned and left before I could say anything. Then the lack of an attentive manager. Would I come back, yes at least to bring the wife. Again give it a try. Here for second visit, took my experience to another level. Gave the fourth star! Service was great, food was good. It's not a Mexican food - it's Nuevo Mexican w/ California flare. Try it if not taken care of I can only encourage you to ask for the Manager!!!

Meal was very flavorful, service was great! I can only stress if you find your meal not to your expectation - ask for a manager!! If you have a request for something outside the box ask it could be possible not a promise but there's always a good chance - menu is pretty diverse. Take a chance I've rated 4 stars here but probably for me is a 3.5 for my overall lifetime experience.

While in the area I made it a point to stop in for lunch. I'll have to say I really like this place but I had to send my food back after waiting right at 20 mins for it! It wasn't hot and the cheese had just reached its melting point, and served on a cold platter and the food wasn't hot!  I decided not to eat today! Maybe another day!  I did share with manager on duty! Again I can only say if there is a problem or concern ask to speak with a manager!!

Gina is a great waitress.  Have eaten there now three times, fair at best.  The shredded beef is tough.  The rice is boring and the salsa and chips very boring.  Youg might ask why do I go because other people choose the place and I was hoping I might find something I could say was good. We had the fried Ice cream and what should have been nice and crispy(corn flakes) was soft and chewy because they were pre made and kept frozen till ordered.

Was greeted and seated right away and then the wait was on.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and you could see that she recognized regular Customers and found that potentially new customers were a bother. BBQ is fair, the fries were fresh cut but still had the taste of a raw potato even though they were cooked .  Seems to be a restaurant in transition (formerly Tom's BBQ) this is the third business in the same store front maybe they'll have a better run but they already need to start working on the staff and really need to find their self as a restaurant is it Cajun or is it BBQ or a hamburger place. Anyway I wish them luck.

Not a good experience not a terrible slow service and poor food quality but not where I would go again anytime soon.  Ordered their Egg Rolls or whatever they're called and they were greasy. Nothing special about the place.  I suggested to the Manager to up his fryer's temperature so he'd get a faster fry and maintain a higher temp during the higher volume.

Five star all the way! Great staff! Very good food! The only thing missing is the beach! Will be back! With the rest of the family. Seems to be a local favorite! I'm sure you'll be able to find something you'll like, and if you don't ask and they probably could accommodate.

Okay Beer was cold I can say that after that I was somewhat taken back by the lack of a lunch crowd. I tried their small spinach salad I can say it didn't come close to the picture ( nice candied pecans abound) not on this salad. Okay here is the simplicity of the salad spinach, feta cheese, chopped candied pecans, dried cherries, cut apples - balsamic dressing ( you can do this at home). Sat at the bar alone meaning the server taking care of the bar was working the floor friendly but not at the bar so my service suffered. Really leaning on the NOT returning side of the fence. Maybe if back in the area, really wasn't a warm fuzzy feeling. Did get a cold beer though! Sure a fancy place for very basic food at a price. No up selling not the best experience - so I would say try it and if it works for you great otherwise I did share my dime's worth.

Seiko, G-shock, Reactor, Citizens, Ball, Hamilton, Luminox and more! These are a few of the many brands offered at Donaldson's Watches. I first met David while he was with Bailey, Banks, and Biddle doing the repairs for them. Since they closed their doors; David and Christine took the opportunity to open the doors to their own shop. I must admit after David's departure from the chain store I had not kept up with him , but I can share with you that I was ecstatic when I walked in their store and I recognized David. I then met his wife Christine who I quickly caught on that she was as knowledgeable about watches. One thing I know is that when I bring my Watches in for repair they'll be handled with the utmost of care. Another thing I can share with all that read this review is that buying a watch from Donaldson's or taking your Watch in for repairs; you'll be treated as a valued CUSTOMER! You are their business and they take the time to help you make a selection that will satisfy you or if it's a gift for that someone special, that they'll be happy with! Always have gotten 5 star service. They're local, they care about you the client! Watch Repair at its best! I say this after buying 5 watches, and several batteries, I often refer people here when the conversation turns to watches.

Service was excellent! It's a burger and beer place!! Character is down home! AZ trail burger was great the fries fresh. I don't give five stars as a rule. Meaning if not earned it isn't because the waitress is cute and friendly (which Erin was all that)! I also mean if this expectation isn't met my next visit it would change. So give them a try! Ask about menu modification and if something is right talk to the manager on duty!

Before you start let me address the BEERS: EXCELLENT CHOICEs - maybe try a flight!  Food; fair nothing exceptional had the lunch special burger w/side (salad). Service was good McKinze was friendly and knew her menu even though it had just changed she said.  Now couple things I agree with "BEER" could be colder!!! Second sat in the booths TVs overhead hard to see TVs otherwise across the room. They could easily solve both concerns.  Again I always form my on opinion and before I'd read any reviews I was thinking the TVs lacked presence.  I gave four stars only because of the service - food not bad just not a "WOW" experience.  Okay the moment of truth: Would I return? At least I'd give another chance and I'd bring the family!

Waiter was awesome, food good but wasn't prepared properly, manager while there didn't once check with a guest saw him move about several times even to the table next to us to clean. It's airport and they know people are captive to what's within the. Airport while traveling so there'll be others to pass through will not be my first choice next time I travel

Order their chicken raspberry salad Chicken was way dry like it was sitting uncoverd and had dried out due to lack of moisture. Dressing was good cannot mess up spinach, but the candied nuts really lacked flavor. Pricey place and really need to step up their product quality. Only to revisit if I'm with someone who wants to go there.

I just had the privilege of utilizing their services pre grand opening as they geared up towards their grand opening with a soft opening on Nov 1 and grand opening Nov 6. The people are friendly, the place is clean. Men don't let the logo fool you they offer all services to US as well.  Did the whole body from the neck down to the toes. Okay I cannot say there wasn't any pain, all I can "Grin and Bare IT" I really like the feel of being bare and the personnel were great at making me feel comfortable. Carla was great! Tell them Alan sent you!

I'll give them 5 stars service and food, pizzeria (3 stars)! Friendly staff key here is keeping quality up and customer satisfaction high. Been awhile sine there has been a place for an option on the highly commercialized pizzas that we endure, so a place with a more "how would I make it at home take" I hope the quality stays high and consistent! If not I'm sure I will advise!

Okay, as I said I read the reviews and decided to try anyway. Started out fairly good. I  hope the management reads and pays attention to the reviews that are written. Tried the dinner salad - was good but could have been colder. Had to ask for the bread. Noticed specials on a board after going to the restroom, even though on a board, it would be good for wait staff to present the special(s). Ordered the filet med and it was medium rare very center. Told management in hopes they would address fixing it for the next customer. It was right at 35 minutes from order to being served. Taste was good, baked potatoes were cooked very well. Veggies were good, but could've been hotter. Okay, now for the dessert this where it went wrong asked for creme burlee- choice chocolate or pineapple; chose chocolate - it wasn't a creme burlee it was chocolate pudding with carmalized sugar on top! It's pricey and will not be a destination any time soon. Had music in the bar which was loud and the acoustics are poor so the places becomes loud and isn't conducive to a conversation. Turn the volume down. The waiter was good till we told him the dessert tasted like chocolate pudding and lacked the texture of creme burlee. The place has character just needs a few attention to details.

One star only because I liked our server! Food was fair! Not going to just spend a lot of words. Not bad food I'll say again but the time it took was way to long 40 - 45 mins. Bad thing was the owner was in the house and was wrapped up in what appeared to be family and friends. Did I mention we were pretty much the only table in there most of the time we were waiting for our pizza, other than as I mentioned the owner and family and friends. It's been more than a year plus since I had visited because of similar slow service.

Two only because the people so far have been friendly and I like the biscuits. Now I ordered their catfish dinner - I was wrong it had only two pieces in it their picture shows three! And, the two pieces really only equated to one piece! Not sure how I'll handle my future eating; their very convenient but for what I got it was very pricey! Love the TV ADS - but this place isn't living up to their value advertising! Tried to call the number from the internet didn't connect , I guess it's a top secret number!

Really disappointed in the attitude of the bartender and his lack of attention to the customer and his lack of ability to apologize for making a mistake ordering my food properly!  It only takes one bad experience and a simple mistake I can understand and I can accept an apology but what I have a hard time when told the order is correct when I know it wasn't. I sat there for a bit before he ever even acknowledged me! This was not a great experience! Really considering not returning at this point. Oh, I did try to speak with the Chef, but wasn't available. Because I try to always encourage talking to someone when you have a problem!

It only takes one bad experience and a simple mistake I can understand and I can accept an apology but what I have a hard time when told the order is correct when I know it wasn't. I sat there for a bit before he ever even acknowledged me! This was not a great experience! Really considering not returning at this point. Okay! Had a chance to speak with mgt and I still believe this place is on track and I can recommend it for your after work and evening bite to eat!

Okay wanted to rewrite the review and say I'd had a chance to speak with management and the staff that resulted in a not so great experience. Apologies was offered and excepted. They really have offered so far some great food! If you haven't taken a drive over, do so, I don't think you'll be disappointed!  If you do have a situation even as simple as the room is to cold or especially if something isn't not right. I cannot stress that enough for any place you visit! These guys are just opening and they're working the kinks out so Speak up and let them know good or bad!
