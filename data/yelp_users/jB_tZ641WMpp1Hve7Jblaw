I cannot get enough of LGO.  My favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over Camelback Mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin.  The breakfast at LGO has something for everybody, IMO. Try the Croque M'Dame if you want something really bold.   The lunch and dinner options are great too. This is the only restaurant I have ever been that I could eat all three meals and feel like I was being served from a different kitchen each time.  The only draw back I can think of for LGO is the tendency for it to become very crowded. That's the best problem a restaurant can have, so they're probably not too worried about it. The parking situation can become an issue too, but for my time and money, it's worth it.  LGO is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly.

The staff was incredible.  I was looking for a quiet spot off the I-10 to meet someone who lives on the other side of Phoenix, so I chose Waffle House thinking it would fit that bill.  However, when I walked inside, the place was buzzing and the staff was completely slammed. They were bright, friendly and efficient. It was noticeable to more than just myself as I watched another patron ask to speak to the manager so she could compliment the service.  I was not in a hurry and told them that, so please take their time with my order. Despite that, my food arrived so quickly after I ordered that I barely had time to sip my coffee.  Great and unexpected experience!

I've never felt as unwelcome in a restaurant as I did last night at Gallo Blanco.   My friend Dixon and I were participants in a mass bike ride through town called Critical Mass. The organizer has an arrangement with the Clarendon Hotel, which is the location for Gallo Blanco. As far as we knew, it was mutually understood that the cyclists were welcome to come by after the ride, grab a drink and use the pool.  From the moment we walked in, the GM was all over the two of us. I should make it clear that neither of us have anything to do with organizing the event. It was almost as if he thought we were trying to "pull one over on him" when we repeatedly told him we were not organizers and thought everything was agreed upon in advance.  Honestly I'm not sure what difference it makes anyway, as we were just like any other patron, dressed normally and wanted to get a drink from the bar. Our mode of transportation should not have made any difference at all. He said "this is my restaurant" to us, as if we were not wanted there.  The GM could sense my annoyance, even though he was interrogating Dixon. He looked over and offered to buy us a drink "when this all gets sorted out." He then pointed us over to the corner and told us to "just wait over here." I can understand not wanting a chaotic scene in a dining room, but this was insulting. The GM never returned to tell us he had spoken to "our leader."  After a few minutes of standing around in the corner, we went to the bar to order drinks. While ordering, the GM walked up, but said nothing. He did not make good on his promise to buy a drink for our troubles, which wasn't really surprising.  I wish I had even one thing nice to say about this venue because I'm sure under different circumstances, it would have been a good experience.   I doubt I will be driving or biking to Gallo Blanco any time in the future.

If I had to pick one brick and mortar establishment in the entire Phoenix metro area, regardless of the service provided therein, to recommend to others with absolutely no worries, this shop would be it. They are that good. I've sent more business to D&W than I can remember in the last 22 years that my family has been using them.  Because of D&W, I have exclusively bought Acuras since I first got my driver license.  They are that good.   These guys will tell you like it is with no bullsh*t. They'll even tell you when it's time to get rid of your car. If you own a Honda or Acura and live within 50 miles of D&W, there's literally no excuse to not use them. Don't blame me when some other shop screws up your Honda/Acura and overcharges you.  Death, taxes and D&W - those are my only sure bets in life. I don't know what more to say.
