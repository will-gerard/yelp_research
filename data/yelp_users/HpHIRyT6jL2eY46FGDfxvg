Nellos is by far my favorite pizza place. I just love the crust, the toppings, the overall taste, and the staff has always been great!

This place is awesome!! If you want some good old fashioned breakfast food at decent prices stop here. All of the good was tasty, the service is amazing, and everyone is friendly. What more could you want? Keep in mind this places gets super busy on the weekends!

***update*** I wrote a letter to the store to share my dissatisfaction. Normally I love chipotle and this experience was not the norm for me. They have done everything they can to apologize and take the feedback. I'm impressed because often any feedback good or bad is pretty much ignored. I have received an email and a phone call to discuss. I appreciate that and that says a lot about the store and taking customer feedback seriously.   Thanks chipotle and the chipotle managers.     Normally I like chipotle and am relatively satisfied. But I've never been to this location nor will I return. It makes me wary to go to another location as well to be honest.  We arrived and waited for them to finish a phone ahead order I'm guessing. No problem there. Then it was our turn. They skimped so much on the meat that my husband ordered a 2nd helping of meat. That cost 3 bucks. No one said how much that would be. He also ordered guac and sour cream. We assume charges for those but no one said how much. You should always say how much.  I was next with tacos. They put a comically small amount of meat on my tortillas and she tried to spread it out to look better I guess. Then she asked me a question. I didn't hear her so I said "I'm sorry what was that?" And she stared at me. Just stared. Lady what did you say?! So I tried to guess and said "salsa? Medium please." And I watched as she tried to put Pico on my tacos. Ew no!!! So I said "wait uh..." and the guy next to her told her which one. She was clearly frustrated and grabbed a salsa and put it on my tacos. I assumed it was medium. It was green.   We got to the end and walked out for 22 bucks. For a burro and 3 tacos. No drinks or anything. So that kind of price I should have a waiter and a margarita lol.   It's definitely not worth the price to get "mexican food" from chipotle. Especially not that location where they skimp on your meat, 2nd helping of meat, and extra condiments.

Loved it! Brooke helped us out and she was amazing. She wasn't fake and didn't "love" everything. She let us talk a bit and then shared what she thought as well. She made the process very easy and did a great job. She was comfortable and confident.   I ended up getting my dress here - after already having tried on about 65 dresses. It looked amazing and I am so happy!

Can I give no stars? That would be more appropriate. Read the reviews, I generally take them with a grain of salt and then get my own opinion. But wow. We had 11 people in the group. The guy came and started pouring water from bottles. Some of us asked for tap water just because. They poured it in glasses where people were not even sitting yet.   The salad bar was ok. The crab legs weren't bad, and the crab meat etc. There was a lot of seafood at the salad bar which was kind of nice. Then we got to the meat portion. Each person received a tiny slice of meat, with a long wait between. We had to ASK to try all of the meats. After we got ham more than once we decided we better ask for the ones we wanted. Some of the meat was plain gross, some of it was fantastic, (only a few) and most were, "eh". Not worth the price at ALL. We had to ask multiple times for some of the meats. Discouraging.   They charged us for the water bottles, which they didn't ask if we wanted. They also tried to charge us for 12 not 11. Then the waiter told us he would not split the tab as in, take more than 1 card. Umm, I know he doesn't want to split it because this is how they make sure they get 18%, but we have 5 or 6 couples, and they are not going to put 400 dollars one card.   Took forever, had to get the host or someone else to help to even get the checks. Not worth a tip, not worth the attitude, oh and thank goodness the dessert was free, because it was awful.

The grill was good. Service was pretty good, food was pretty tasty, and the ambiance is nice.   We all had something different.  I had chicken crepes, very rich, lots of mushrooms, very tasty. Good job.  My boyfriend ordered a Prime Rib, which they were out of, and he ended up ordering another steak, which was tasty. My friend had a cobb salad. More items in the salad than lettuce, yummy, good job.  Her boyfriend had a prime rib dip. Which is made out of prime rib, which we were told they were out of. I guess it is pre made? Not sure. But the sandwich was really bland, definitely not the best dish on the menu.   Now, the mashed potatoes. I was NOT a fan. Who puts nutmeg or cloves in mashed potatoes and doesn't tell a person!?!? I see mashed potatoes and thing, YUM, butter, maybe milk, maybe cream, maybe even garlic. But nutmeg and cloves? Unless you like that, don't order the mashed potatoes.   Now, the not so tasty mashed potatoes also came with a hair. Doesn't totally gross me out, but isn't pleasant. I asked for mashed potatoes to go, hoping I would like them later, but nope I did not. However, the manager comped some desserts and whatnot to make up for it. We did not ask for this, so I am assuming he did because we were really nice and easy going about the whole matter.   So, although parts of the dishes I would not order again, because of the other food, the service, and the overall care of the manager (generosity as well), I would definitely go back.   The desserts we had wereL: A chocolate souffle thing, which was yummy, and a banana thing, which I personally was "meh" about, but my friend LOVED it. Thanks wcg!

I had a great experience. I looked at reviews online and decided to take a chance. The scheduling lady was great in the morning, the staff when I got there was great, and Dr. Tosca was fantastic. I think I was an easy patient though. But, who knows? I called as soon as they opened, and I was able to get an appointment about an hour later.  I will continue to use this doctor as my PCP. He was really nice.

So far so good! I have had one appointment and everything went well. I had my consultation, Jill explained everything, and I decided to go for it. She is reasonably priced and not much more than a good wax. However, it hurts less, and it lasts longer.  Jill was professional, made me feel very comfortable, and scheduled my next appointment right there. The receptionist (although we played phone tag) was nice and friendly enough each time I spoke with her. She also called my the day before my appointment each time.   Just a reminder, no lotions or deoderant before the visit. Also make sure the hair is JUST above the skin. So, electric razor is probably the best idea.   Jill also goes over the areas twice so that everything is taken care of. Some spots were missed (or my hair cycle finally made everything grow back). Either way 6 weeks later and I am ready for my 2nd appointment. Probably 85% of my hair is gone.

I thought it was great. The wine was fantastic, the owner served us and was incredibly nice. There was someone playing music in the bar, (a little cramped I was worried it would be too loud), and otherwise awesome. I went in on a groupon, and I didn't get ANY attitude about it (which is weird I get that more than I think I should!).   Yummy, yummy, and more yummy. Go at happy hour! And re-cork? Are you kidding? Nice idea, but my friend and I drank ALL our wine LOL

This place is freakin phenomenal! I go there once a week sometimes. It is not necessarily close to my work, but my co-workers and I dont mind the drive!!! Their pork tacos are by far the best. Sometimes there are some random specials, and the chicken ones are ok. Besides, 5 bucks for 3 tacos? Yes please!

Very cute shop and great dresses! They have an under 2k section and an over 2k section. Don't be too scared though - as they will sell off the rack!   The lady who is part (or full) owner is very knowledgeable and very nice to work with. My bridal party thought she came off a little formal but in the dressing room she was very friendly. She shared with them exactly what I asked her to - she was amazing.   I would definitely recommend checking it out even though I did not get my dress here-  I loved the visit!

Best little secret!  Handmade noodles.   Delicious every time!   We would recommend the wide noodles. More flavor. They will run out because they are made in house.   Our favorites are the beef noodles and the fried rice.   Also quick service to go  check it out!!

This is NOT Mexican food. I repeat NOT Mexican food! We walk in, nice place, kind of surprising how cute it is inside. The booths have pillows, and are cozy very cool. To get appetizer and drink specials you HAVE TO SIT AT THE BAR. Oh and chips and salsa cost money, nothing free here!   The margaritas are on "special" for $5. Not that great. Also not worth sitting uncomfortably at the bar to get.   We were the only people there, on a Friday night. Yes, it was before 5pm or 6pm,, but really? The wait staff was super friendly and made sure we had everything we needed (except real mexican food maybe?).   The menu had pork chops, pork loin, sandwiches and ribs. So don't go here thinking it is a Mexican food place like we did PLEASE. The food was marginally "ok". The spiciness was "ok". The red "smoked" sauce tasted burned, and the actual food on my boyfriend's carne adovada WAS burned. It was also very DRY... this is their specialty dish?  Service good,, but not even close to worth the 50 bucks we threw down for the meal for 2 people and 2 drinks.   Just know you are going for a....want to be higher class restaurant... that really has nice ambiance, but the food is not up to par.

Addition -- GO SEE DR.TOM!!! He is hands down the best chiropractor I have seen EVER.   I love this place. There is a woman chiro most days, and a man on Tuesdays. I love them both. The woman is amazing (I can't remember names, sorry). She remembers personal things, always asks about my last tournament and always remembers what was injured previously. My injuries healed previously and that was fantastic.  Dr. Tom is a bit more thorough with me. He literally adjusts EVERYTHING. He makes everything pop, every place there is an issue he fixes, and he even does some sports deep tissue work quickly.  I am always in and out on my lunch break and still have time to eat. I NEVER feel rushed though.  It is very convenient and you get a membership card. You get you number of adjustments per pay period, but if you do not use them you lose them.  One bit of advice. Notes after each session would be useful. I went in to see a different chiro and had to re-explain my situation. Unless he saw notes and asked me explain anyway LOL.  Also, you can cancel any time :)

Don't bother! Not only was the food not so good, but also the service was TERRIBLE. The inside is a little shabby, my seat was moving every time I adjusted (bench seat in a booth), and the service took forever. We ordered nachos that took about 20 minutes to come out and were cooled down a lot by the time we received them. We also had to ask the host to get our server just to pay the bill. If the food or the service is amazing then I am ok, but it was neither :(.

I tried on a lot of dresses here but first -- we waited about 10-15 minutes for a room and a consultant. We were on time for our appointment so I am not sure why this happened. Then, our consultant put 6 of us total, in a room where another group was, AND then shared! So, my consultant was helping another bride and myself. Well - I did a lot of waiting :(  Also - she just had us walk around and pick out dresses. She wrote NONE of them down and I pointed out 20 dresses easy. Some of them she forgot about (weird I know) and we had to remind her. She pulled the dresses over my head - which I guess is ok but by the end of the day my skin was just wrecked.   Someone else helped a few times and she was awesome - she knew her stuff! Not sure why I had to share really but it was very frustrating.

I would really love to give this place a review but unfortunately I was not able to. Most of the time this would be no big deal. However they only had two people getting pedicures and she told me to come back 2.5 hours later to get a service when on the front door it very clearly states that walk-ins are welcome and accepted.

Walked in. They did a great job and actually cared if what they were doing hurt or not. That's awesome! Color has lasted a while and I play volleyball in the sand, so you can imagine I'm rough on my toes. Will go back!

I LOVED this place! I took my friend here for her birthday. We had salsa, guacamole, the tamale, ceviche, and some tacos. The tamales WAS AMAZING GET THAT!!! The drinks were ok. We had the Sangria. In my opinion it was a little weak.   The service was pretty good, hence the ONLY reason I gave 4 stars. They did a pretty good job, but there were a few times where we could have really used someone stopping by. And although we were sharing everything, we really didn't need it all brought out at once (appetizers and main dishes), Although that could have been a miscommunication.

Terrible experience for us!  Four of us went out to Bootleggers in Phoenix because we were in the area and the one in Scottsdale was good so -- why not?  We were seated pretty quickly - we asked for the booth but it was under a reservation that was already late. They said they would move us but never did (and the reservation never showed). After looking over the menu for 10 minutes we realized no one has stopped by our table to ask us if we wanted drinks or not. So we asked the hostess to send over our waiter if possible.   Our waitress Tami (not our actual waitress but the girl who was going to take care of us) came over and said "I was told no one has stopped by your table! So I am going to help you out." Awesome, by this time (15+ minutes sitting there without drinks - other than the water the bus boy left) we were ready to order. So we ordered it all and waited. Someone at our table ordered coffee and I ordered iced tea - everyone else had water.   I asked for a straw when my tea came out that I never got and I was never offered sugar or anything for the tea. When the coffee came out she was holding it and telling us that it made her hands warm. Awesome, but can you NOT hold the cup in the place where I drink it? I hate it when someone hands me my drink and your fingers are touching where my mouth goes. NOT OK. Also - no "do you want cream or sugar?" nothing.   So, we went to find the hostess and ask for some cream and sugar for the coffee after waiting another 5 or so minutes with nothing coming out. She said "yeah it's in the fridge" and eventually brought it out to our table (mind you I still have no straw and no sugar).   Then we receive our food. It was dry and overcooked. My pulled pork was flavorful but dry and overcooked. Once we received our food, she never came back to us. Until it was time to pay. It isn't like it was super busy. I am glad we apparently didn't need anything else. This was SUCH a ridiculous disappointment after having such a good experience in Scottsdale.   Overall - it was not worth the money we spent or the time and frustration.   Go to the one in Scottsdale instead.

LOVED THIS PLACE! Decy was amazing. She was honest and helpful. She was cheery and fun. I loved her!   She told me a few things "it's not as flattering as that one" or "if you want to change that many things take it off, it clearly isn't the one" so, I appreciated that SO much!   She was easy to schedule with, stayed a long time (probably longer than she should have) and was a machine helping me in and out of dresses!  This store had my favorite dress - until one just blew my socks off. Otherwise this would have been the place.   Check it out! A lot of these dresses have never been worn! Plus she had some cool - OLD - vintage dresses!

Came to this little spot in Scottsdale for restaurant week. I had the burrata, scallops, and chocolate cake. My husband had the burrata, filet, and apple strudel. Everything tasted great! All of the ingredients were good so that was a big win right there. The scallops are quite small but were cooked very well.  The only bad thing is that it was quite loud and we happened to get sat at the coldest booth in the house apparently. It was freezing in the corner! I'm glad I brought my jacket!   The wait staff was very good. Pleasant but not too much and not too stand offish.    I liked the nautical decor, food, and quality. I'd return to try the fish tacos and burgers but probably on a day time visit. The prices didn't seem unreasonable for the area and quality (we saw the actual menu but didn't order from it).  We shall return!

I have to say I was skeptical. It's near Fiesta mall the parking lot was pretty empty. I'm so glad we decided to stay though!  The waiter was very good, prompt, and very polite.  The food took some time (even with only a few customers) but it was fresh, plated well, and has quickly become one of our new favorite locations.   We ate the Yellow Daddy roll, the Love Heart roll (yummy!!!), and the Garlic Tuna roll (delicious!).   We would recommend it and we WILL be back!!!!

LOVED THIS PLACE!! It was amazing. The dresses are great, lots of choices, and my consultant TASHA was superb. It was my first stop and it made everything start out on the right foot.   If you go, ask for Tasha - she is amazing.   Although I did not end up getting my dress here - the customer service and care that went into this store made it very difficult to beat!
