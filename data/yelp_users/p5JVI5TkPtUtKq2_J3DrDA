Ethan is a true master of his profession. He is a color guru and he really cares about each cut and color he does. He is a great listener and will let you know your type of hair cannot do what you are looking for and offer suggestions.  I have been going to Ethan for over 10 years. I have occasionally 'cheated' on him with other stylists but I always go back because he is truly the best! If you want great color this is your guy!!

Great vibe and attentive staff.  Two must haves... the macaroni & cheese and the short ribs.  I am not much of a meat eater but you could feed me the short ribs every day (with a side of mac of course).  The wine list is extensive and updated often and the staff knows which wines to suggest.

This is the Real Deal when it comes to pizza and calzones.  I loved the pizza at first but now I cannot get enough of the calzones.  The are huge and enough for two meals if you are a girl... men could probably finish the calazone in one sitting and feel more than satisfied.  I drive across town just to feel my craving.  The good thing is, it is inexpensive so that makes up for the gas money.  I'm hooked!

Great staff and never disappointing.  I have a hard time going here and not getting the Stetson Salad.  Interesting food combinations that definitely please the taste buds.

The Carne Adobada is the best in town and I love the salad they provide before the meal.  I have tried many dishes at this place, Heidi Pasta great and I like the trio  that includes the enchilada and tamale but I am hooked on the adobada.  The only downfall is the wait,  sometime I am just too hungry.  A girls gotta eat!!

Ok, so I thought I would give this place a tryone more time since everyone raves about it. I will not make that mistake again. I should have just left it alone and stuck to my original opinion... ok, but nothing special. Now I must say my last experience was horrible. To start the water tasted awful and the chips were cold and stale. How can you mess up a cheese crisp, well the Tee Pee did, again cold. My taco was made incorrectly and the chimi my friend got , not so good. I love good ol Mexican food, but this place has missed the mark. Thank god they have nostalgia working in there favor.

This is a great place to go either to begin the evening with friends or at the end of the night, thanks to their late hours (midnight).  The martinis are one of the best intown and the food always good.  The only thing lacking is the service... very slow and not always attentive.  Thank goodness the atmosphere and food are so good it helps to overlook the not so service.

I've been to Joe's & Bobby Q's but Dave's takes the BBQ on this one! We got Dave's family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And don't forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!

This is one of my 'go to' places when I am looking for a casual, low cost lunch or dinner. All of the hummus selections are tasty. I usually treat myself to the chicken & hummus with a combination of the cilantro & pepper hummus. The food and vibe is great. I would definitely recommend.

What a great hidden spot in Old Town.  The wine great, people friendly and the art in the place is fabulous.  They feature local artists, which I am a huge fan of - I prefer to support the locals, whether is art, restaurants or boutiques.  Right now they have a great artist that does contemporary paintings... beautifully done and VERY reasonably priced.  Put this on your radar.

They may have some good clothing options but the people that work her are NOT friendly.  Regardless if you are the owner or work there... I came into your store to spend money... be nice is all I ask.  Because of my handful of bad experiences with the staff.  I will not return.

Always enjoy my time spent at City Hall. My first stop is at the bar to indulge in there wonderful martinis and if you are lucky Tammy will be working. She is the most friendly and professional bartender and always remembers your name. The food is consistantly good.  The only reason I give City Hall 4 stars is because they need a new lounge singer and updated decor.  I would spend more time at this establishment if the talent was better.   My husband and I will see you soon Tammy, with out earplugs in :)

I am a huge fan of this place. It has a great range of prices (some of which I have a hard time justifying to my pocket book) but majority I can afford. The quality of the garments are good and I love the fact that no one will have your same outfit on. I am a loyal Rowdy customer and highly recommend... oops maybe i should not share my fashion secret.  Also the owners who are usually always there are super friend and helpful.

Fabulous food and amazing decor - and food is just as spectacular!! The guac is a must every time! I MUST recommend brunch... I split the cinnamon waffles (like desert) and the chicaquiles (sp?). I got the best of both worlds a south of the border breakfast with eggs and the waffles were like a dessert. This will be a regular brunch spot for me on the patio. Thank goodness they are off the noisy and busy Scottsdale road!  See you soon at The Mission - I'm the cute one with the bloody mary on the patio.

Still head over hills for The Mission.  I have even made a pit-stop on the way home to kill my sweet potato fries and grilled street corn craving (I know carb overload).  They just added a few new things to the menu, one of which is the black cod, loved it (hopefully that can help balance out my love of the carbs).  Be sure to make a reservation because the cat is out of the bag on the locally owned gem!!

The Mission NEVER disappoints!  Still in love after 3+ years.  Each time I am at there I always try something new.  I was fortunate enough to choose the chimichurri steak served over a cheese bread (the server informed me the bread was gluten free, BONUS) and washed it down with a coconut strawberry mojito.  The staff is always so friendly and accommodating, even when it is busy and the restaurant is full.

If I could I would give the place negative stars. The staff was EXTREMELY rude not just one but all 5+ that we encountered. It was not for a lack of trying on our part... We were friendly tried to make conversation and tipped well but still couldn't even get a smile out of the staff.  The later you are at this place the more questionable the crowd becomes. Felt VERY unsafe. I will never return and have told all my friends to do the same. Sucks to have to post such a negative review.

Love this place, exactly what I have been looking for!! I have taken a number of different classes and I am hooked. I'm in my 30's and was looking for a dance studio that was not to serious, but provides a good workout (no recitals). This is a great place to get some exercise and have fun doing it!

Walked in the door, my phone reading 856p and we were turned away stating they were closed. Really?? Sign said they serving at 9p.  Other tables with menus in hand and they were willing to let us walk. We will never be back.  As I write this review my car reads 858p. Poor customer service in full display!

My husband is a BBQ junkie, me not so much... until now. Loved the brisket, and jalape√±o sausage. The mac&cheese and creamed corn are also pretty good. My hubby is also a fan

My apologies for not writing this review earlier, but you can thank me now.  I have had the pleasure of dining at The House Brasserie on more than a handful of times during brunch, lunch and dinner.  When I find a new place that I obsess about, I find myself making up reasons to return and the holidays provided just the perfect excuse! This is an old house that has been converted into a restaurant.  You will feel like you have been transported out of Arizona.  I am already thinking of throwing a baby / wedding shower on the beautiful patio.  I will start with brunch, the brunch menu is limited at this point but the staff said Chef Carter plans to add more selections.  But heck, I do not need more selections. I dined with 2 friends and we started with the family style marscapone eggs.  These eggs were exceptionally tasty and fluffy and serve with warm baguette on the side.  The highlight tho was the crepe. This should come as no surprise since the chef said his first job in France was as a creperie.  The crepe was filled with marscapone with just the right amount of sweetness and topped with an assortment of fresh warm berries. I begged the manager to add this to there dessert menu so I could indulge more often.  I have had the pleasure of dining at The House for lunch a couple of times, an absolutely charming place to enjoy and leisurely lunch on the patio.  Luckily I have dined with friends who do not mind sharing a bite of there meal.  I have been impressed with all of the items. So far I have tried the turkey, pastrami, chicken parm, shaved pork belly and the double burger. All of these sandwiches are served with outstanding crinkle fries.  The standout sandwich was the shaved pork belly BUT you really cannot go wrong with any of the selections from my experience.   On to dinner, where to begin...  I definitely recommend starting with one of the amazing homemade soups and salads.  I love the kale salad. Then you can go in either directions and try a bunch of share plates or order a entree. I have done them all but whatever I order I an sure to get the kale salad and popcorn bacon grits; simply divine.   See you again soon House Brasserie!! I love you
