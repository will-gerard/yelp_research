Traditionally this has been one of my favorite restaurants growing up in North Phoenix.  I do miss the good old days when their menu was awesome and the waiters and waitresses had a bit of a pep in their step and were eager to please.  I realize that the economic conditions have been less than ideal but I had one of the worst experiences around Christmas time.  Our waitress seemed to sympathize with us and our long wait as she comped our soft drinks.  I left heart broken and came to the sad conclusion that this place is a shell of its former self and will never be the same again.  With that said, everyone deserves a second chance and from what I understand this family owned chain has been to hell and back and are somehow still open.  Because this place is iconic in the valley of the sun and because it gave me so many warm and happy memories, I will be back shortly with an open mind and a healthy appetite.  For now I will base this review on my collective experience at this restaurant as I think they are entitled to it.  Just wish that my fellow diners who are new to the Big Apple or Phoenix for that matter could appreciate this place for what it once was and what I still believe it can be.

Finally made it in as I had planned and I was very impressed.  Had the chicken fried steak dinner and shared the potato skins for an appetizer.  My Mom had the sirloin which was also awesome!  We came away very pleased and the waitress assured us that some of our favorites would likely be back on the menu next year.  Going to make sure I spread the word and we will be back a bit more often.  Also I enjoyed the music and the service was excellent!

Definitely a fan of this place after subconsciously avoiding it for years. I mean I drove by it with curiosity several times but could not wrap my mind around Asian-Mexican-Caribbean fusion..  It's also in an old unassuming strip-mall north of the busy 19th ave and Greenway intersection.  In fact some people who I trust told me it was so so or not their "cup of tea".  A colleague/work friend mentioned it last week and said she always wanted to try it.  We decided to head down at lunch time(about 11am) and there were already people gathered around the door which was a good hint about the food.  Once inside I noticed that it was not really that impressive with very basic tables and chairs and not much in the way of decor.  A nice young lady at the "ordering station" caught me up to speed on how to fill out the order card which got my mind wondering about all of the various combinations you can have.  She also let me know about making an item into a burrito or a quesadilla.  I played it safeand ordered the Jade Red Chicken-Emerald Chicken combo with chicken fried rice and refried beans.  The Jade Red Chicken was fried and glazed  in a sweet and spicy sauce. Pretty much comfort food at it's best.  It had just enough crunch to go away with the great flavor.   The Emerald Chicken was a tender grilled chicken dish prepared with green onions and a ginger sauce.  Amazingly different than my other item yet it seemed to go well with the rice and beans.  As we began to finish our lunches(quite fast I might add), we all began acknowledging that it was really pretty good and you could not beat the prices. All of our entrees were under $10 which is cheap these days.  All and all I was very impressed and cannot wait to get back up there and try the jerk chicken, quesadilla, and chile relleno.  Overall I was not super impressed with the aesthetics of the restaurant but that does not seem to be the point of this place..  I can see how some would not like it because it is a little different but it definitely appealed to the taste buds and a place I would recommend to anyone.  Just don't expect a fancy joint!

Only heard good things about this place and finally decided to check them out..  We were there on a Sunday and they had a pretty cool band called "Behind the Badge" who were raising money for a charitable cause.   I would have given 5 stars but the service was very slow and they did not seem to happy to be serving us outside.  We generally had to get up and walk inside to ask them for food/drinks.  With that out of the way, the food and drinks made up for the poor service!  Tried the soft pretzels(they were out of the large pretzels so I had two smaller ones)  It was a lot of food and seemed somewhat average but not bad.  My aunt got an order of the potato pancakes which were outstanding! They were accompanied with sour cream and applesauce which added to the flavor.  I'm a real big fan of German beers so I had a couple of Dunkels which went really well with my appetizer.  When it was time to order dinner, my waiter recommended the Chicken Cordon Bleu Schnitzel which was actually pretty solid.  Later I tried a bite of the pretzel schnitzel which was even better!  At this point I'm a fan of the food and would recommend it just because of the food and German beer on tap.  The service was rather poor except for the bartender who went out of his way to make us some unusual shots.  I'm fairly confident they were spread a little thin so I would like to try them again on a weeknight or Saturday.   will definitely check them out again and will be back to try the veal schnitzel and some of the sausages.  Cool place!

Had a gift card that I was given by a coworker who knew this was one of my favorite places.. Just a bit of context: I've been coming here my entire life since the 80's and always felt like this was a good spot to take out of town guests for great Mexican food.  The quality has dropped off quite a bit but not nearly as bad as the service.  Stopped in with my aunt and asked for a table around 8pm.  I got a parking spot right up front so I assumed that the dinner rush was over.  Was surprised to be told that it would be several minutes for the two of us.  After seeing about 3-4 people sort of standing there a young lady asked me if I had a party of 3. I said oh no it's just the two of us as I had told her about 3 minutes before.  They took us to the back of the restaurant and I was surprised that there were several open booths.  Because we were back by the POS machine I could hear a few of the wait staff complaining about a late rush.  Again they did not seem very busy but if they are understaffed I get it.  We quickly got chips and salsa and I felt bad because it took me a few minutes to decide what I wanted so I just ordered drinks and continued to look at the menu.  I ordered the #1 combo which came with an enchilada, taco, and tamale.  Not too bad for $15.  Food came out in just a few minutes which was great.  We had asked for more chips and salsa but about 10 minutes into our dinner the waitress came over and took our chips away and asked me if I wanted a box.  I was sort of upset because I was not sure I was going to take the taco home.. In fact now I figured maybe she is judging me and assuming that it's too much food to take home.  I actually needed them to split the check but the problem was that we still planned to munch on some chips and order more drinks.  We made the point that we wanted more chips and asked why she had taken them.. She blamed it on the guy who brought us chips which was ridiculous.  Then I felt bad about troubling her to break the bill in half because I had a gift card..  She seemed very frustrated because clearly we were keeping her from getting out of there.  It was not quite 9pm but there were others still dining in the restaurant so I felt like our experience was cheapened because our waitress wanted out.  I would have gotten another margarita and perhaps some fried ice cream.  I understand.. I'm human and sometimes I just want to get out of work but if I'm dealing with a client, customer, or even a work colleague, I don't project my interests on them to suit my needs.  I was very displeased with our waitress as I wish she just would have transferred us to another member of the wait staff rather than rush our dining experience. Also had asked for white enchilada sauce and they just glopped a bunch of cream cheese on my enchilada which was burnt and charged me $2.50 for it.. Probably should have asked to send it back but our waitress was not very interested in having us there so I decided to explain my experience on here. So shame on Valle Luna for making those poor folks work and keeping them from their important lives.  I'm certain if I behaved that way at work, I would not have to worry about the job very long.. Sorry again for coming in and I will make sure that I think twice before coming back here.  I hope I was not too much of an inconvenience for our waitress.

Had a pretty terrible experience with the young man at the drive through.  I typically only comment when I have great experiences and usually Lenny's is excellent.  Stopped by for some Friday evening chili cheese fries and a shake.  My aunt actually just wanted an ice cream sundae.  First off the kid had a major attitude and kept making us repeat the order through the drive through and scowled at us as we pulled up to the window.  Secondly when my aunt asked what comes on the sundae and he said usually nuts but they were all out. Well that is unfortunate but it is what it is.  She then asked if it had whipped cream on the Sundae.  The young man said they used to but they got in trouble for putting whipped cream on the sundaes and they could only put it on the shakes??..  He passed the blame to the manager which I thought was kind of strange.  He also did not even offer to do an up charge on the whipped cream  You would think they least they could do since there was no nuts, is offer free whipped cream but we were not even asking for that.  Overall the experience left us confused and made me think I would avoid this overpriced ****hole in the future.  Clearly the young man was either having a bad day or was just really freaked out that a customer might want a sundae with the traditional ingredients.  Also a smile and a friendly attitude goes a long way when you cannot accommodate a customer.

I wanted to mention that my rating does not mean that this is a fancy joint but this place stands out amongst similar restaurants.  First off the line to be seated is usually long if that tells you anything.  The breakfasts are HUGE and delicious though simple.  The hash browns are perfectly crispy and the omelet I ate was fluffy and tasty with fresh items.  I enjoyed a nice cup of fruit which I opted to finish over the massive biscuits with gravy.  I love breakfast and this place left me full and content.  I suppose my only complaint would be the fact that they put four of us in a tiny little booth when there were larger tables which were occupied by a couple of people.  $40 fed four people which seems to be a rarity these days if you want decent food..

Booked a reservation for my graduation and received a phone call after confirming the reservation telling me that they "over committed" themselves to other events.  Not acceptable and I will be sure to tell everyone to not bother with this place.  Food is so so and overpriced anyways..  Why would you not check before taking a reservation.  Completely unacceptable..

Decided to check this place out after finding it accidentally.  A work colleague and I decided to hit up the lunch buffet and came away pleasantly surprised.  Staples like the Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo were excellent and I was surprised to see a HUGE selection along with a fresh looking salad bar.    Naan bread was frequently brought to our table and we were given the option of garlic or regular.  Both were very good.  I was also very happy with the service as my iced tea was kept full constantly.  The price was also right as I have tried a few different places around town which were subpar in comparison but way more expensive.    Overall I can recommend coming for lunch as we had an excellent experience and I look forward to coming back for dinner and bringing family/friends.  A great dining experience!

Pretty good food at amazingly affordable prices and they deliver to my work.  I have ordered a few times and have been pleased with the Mongolian Beef, the Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Kung Pao Chicken.  My only complaint was the Crab Puffs/Wontons which were a bit too chewy but they made up for it with excellent egg rolls!  Generous portions and lots of natural flavoring from the veggies.  Definitely not the best food I have ever had but it's very good and for the money, they cannot be beat!

Hit up Sushi Catcher the other day and I was very impressed.  It's in a rather unassuming strip mall and the inside of the restaurant is kind of bland yet sterile but don't let that fool you.  The sushi was great and so were the prices.  I was lucky to be there during happy hour and the most expensive roll I got was the Casey roll which was pretty delicious.  The Las Vegas roll was excellent as well.  I got a Sake Bomb for $5 and was very happy with the service.  I only wish I had brought a bunch more people with me to enjoy.  I will be back for sure!

Was on my way to applebees for a nice cheap dinner and came across this place.. I was surprised to see it occupied after my beloved Native Grill(Native New Yorker closed down a while back.  For some reason I was intrigued to check it out so plans changed a bit.  Luckily it was happy hour and I was happy to see that they had the $5 large sake bombs on the happy hour menu. Also something about $2 beers.  Since it was a bit later they had the happy hour menu which I was happy to see included soups, apps, sushi favorites and chinese!  My aunt and I ordered the tempura combo which was very good and included fried mushroom, shrimp, broccoli, sweet potato and onion ring.  It was delicious!  Only recommendation is to maybe offer a tangy sweet or spicy sauce and not the mayo based stuff.  It was still pretty good. For dinner I got the kung pao chicken and we split the Philly Roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. Both were in generous portions and the presentation was awesome.  It tasted very good and came out extremely quick.. I was a bit disappointed that they were so slow because I really would like to have a local sushi restaurant in the neighborhood.  Overall I was very pleased with the sushi and happy hour portioned Chinese and I'm excited to come back and try some of their chinese dishes and try some more sushi.  It was priced right, tasty, and in a pretty good location(by Santisi Brothers and Applebees)  I did find it kind of funny that they had all of the Native New Yorker signs inside. This place seems HUGE for a sushi/chinese joint but I will do my best to come back often and share with my friends and family on this side of town!  It's definitely a great new place!
