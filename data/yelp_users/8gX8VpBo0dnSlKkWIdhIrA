As a Chicago native, I'm always on the lookout for food that reminds me of home, so the other night when a friend and I were trying to decide where to grub I mentioned that I could go for an Italian beef. He said he knew a spot, so we ended up at the Scottsdale Luke's, and it was so good that I had my parents meet me at the Indian School location a week later to try that one out.  Both times I had an Italian beef with cheese, no peppers, and a side of fries with cheese, and an RC Cola to wash it all down. The problem with most Italian beef sandwiches I've had out here is the beef itself...usually it's chewy or just sub-par, but Luke's gets it right. The beef is tender, juicy, and just right. The sandwiches come dipped (wet), so it's a sloppy ordeal but that's how it's supposed to be. If you don't want to get a little messy with your dinner, then ask for it "dry".   I'll definitely be back, but I'm gonna have to limit my visits as this ain't exactly healthy eats...however, I'm ok with that for food that tastes this good.

I've made several visits to the Chicago Hamburger Co, I was initially introduced by a friend who knew that I was originally from Illinois and missed some good old fashioned Midwest comfort food. My first venture there I tried their Italian beef sandwich, which really hit the spot. I got it with mozzarella and a side of red sauce, not exactly traditional but sometimes I just get that craving. It was pretty good on this occasion, the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased. Round two, not so much...it didn't stack up to the initial experience I had. My quest for the classic Italian beef in Arizona will continue elsewhere... Due to the failed Italian beef situation,  on my next visit I got a burger. Good, but nothing amazing. Visit number four found me giving the double cheese sliders a try, and I think I found my mainstay for this joint. While the regular double burger was a bit much and left me feeling like a fat bastard for the next 6 hours, two of these delicious little double cheese sliders did the trick perfectly. The fries are usually on point, I dump a healthy dose of Cajun seasoning on them as a rule. All in all, a pretty cool joint that reminds me why Chicago will always be "home"...

I'll be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed the first time that I ate here 2+ years ago. Since then, I've gradually come to really enjoy the food here, and we have gotten an explanation as to some previous inconsistencies with the food here at a certain point in the past (management/cooking staff changes were made). I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa. I swear, I could eat just chips and salsa/queso and be happy if I had to. Anyway, if you're in the Anthem area, this is one of the better options if you're looking to get away from the typical chain restaurant dining that plagues that area.

I've eaten at this particular Carrabba's probably 25 times, and at numerous other locations over the years, including the one off of FLW up in Scottsdale. It's usually in my top 3 whenever anyone offers to take me out for a meal (truth be told, it ain't cheap...but it's well worth it).  The bread they bring out for starters is great, but it's the herb mix that they mix with the oil that really makes it fantastic. Sooo good. I usually order the chicken noodle soup, which certainly ain't no Campbell's. It's got a nice, spicy kick to it, unlike any other chicken noodle soup I've ever had before, and it has HUGE chunks of soft, white meat chicken.  For the main course, I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. Two healthy sized chicken breasts flattened out, breaded, and cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of cheese and traditional red marinara to top it off. For my pasta I go with their fettucini alfredo, I'm sure it isn't the healthy option, but it's a great compliment to the chicken. The portions are so big (on top of being half full on bread and soup already) that I always end up taking half of it home with me.   I've sampled their lasagne (usually my Dad's choice), and it's quite delicious...my mom and my sister usually opt for the filet with a side of marsala sauce, and 9 times out of 10 it's amazing. From time to time, the chef undercooks it, but everyone's idea of "medium-well" is (somewhat) subjective, and they're always happy to throw it on the grill for a few more minutes if necessary. Another item that I've enjoyed is the garlic mashed potatoes, and that says a lot because I'm not usually a big fan of 'em elsewhere.  I think I've had dessert here maybe twice, because by that point in the dining experience I am usually so stuffed that I can't even fathom cramming any more food into my face. Regardless, the chocolate cake/ice cream thing we got was also top notch.  The service is usually great, the establishment is always clean and proper, the atmosphere is pretty cool, a bit loud at times when the place is busy, but that doesn't really bother me. I didn't come here to have an in-depth discussion of politics, I came to get my grub on! There's an older Italian guy at the Scottsdale location that never fails to remind me that my hat is on wrong...which just furthers his old school italian credibility.   5 stars, no question about it. LOVE this place!

So after reading the reviews for Lulu's, and with the fact that it's literally right down the street from me, I decided to head over and take this place for a test drive since I had the day off.  Pretty unassuming from the outside, I walked in and noticed the salsa bar to the side of the counter. Good start, this meant I was definitely gonna have to order the chips and salsa. I talked to the woman behind the counter for a few to get an idea of what to expect with certain dishes, and I settled on three regular tacos so I could try a couple different kinds of meat. I ordered one chicken, one steak, and one shredded beef. Now, when I got them home I was a little bummed that they were on the small side, but each one was delicious in it's own way. The steak was perfect, much better than what you find at most places. The shredded beef had an amazing flavor, despite dripping a combination of spice and grease, and the chicken was fajita style chunks of pure white meat. Delicious! My only complaint was the salsa...I tried all three, but none of them were particularly stellar. The best of the three was the one labeled "Salsa for chips", but it was nothing to write home about. All of them were kind of just bland and average at best. Despite the minor salsa bummer, I will DEFINITELY be back here...now I know to rock the super tacos (a bit more expensive, but surely bigger), and load up on those and bypass the chips and salsa. Maybe give the rice a try for round two...either way, check out Lulu's, good food here!

The other day my coworker and I attempted to hit up El Buen Sabor for their $0.99 taco tuesday special (seeing a theme here yet?), and much to our dismay, their doors were locked, their menu board was down, and it appears as though they have shut down. Since we didn't want to drive much further, he recommended we give Manuel's a try, and as I didn't have much of a choice, I agreed. I ordered two tacos, the shredded beef was ok, however the chicken was the absolute WORST I've had in as long as I can remember. I was starving, and I couldn't even bring myself to eat more than two bites. Very disappointing...it takes some serious hard work and effort to completely f-up something as simple as chicken! I filled up on chips and salsa, which were decent, but I just can't get over the whole chicken ordeal. Not to mention, at $15 after tip, this was no bargain. I will not be making a return appearance.

After seeing people come back to work with these white Venezia's pizza boxes for the past couple months, I suspected that they knew something that perhaps I didn't...and I was correct. What they knew, and I had the pleasure of finding out today, was that you CAN get a damn good lunch for under $6! Their special consisting of 2 huge one-topping slices and a drink was just right...I left fully satisfied and full, without that "I just swallowed a brick" feeling. I definitely intend to make this a regular weekly lunch spot, keep up the good work guys!  **UPDATE** I just need to make a quick addition to my review here, I have recently fallen in love with their chicken pesto pizza, oh my, this stuff is AMAZING. Granted, 6 hours later when you burp you'll taste it all over again (and my friend's wife doesn't appreciate the garlic breath that results from these slices), but it's a sacrifice well worth making. Also, even though they charge extra for a side of ranch, it's a necessity for dipping and a perfect compliment to their crust.

I'll be the first to admit, I haven't really had the best of luck with Mexican food in this town. For some strange reason, a lot of the restaurants that I've visited around here have really fallen short of my expectations, much less, they continued to prove to me that you CAN actually F something as simple as chicken up if you try hard enough (Manuel's, I'm looking at you!).  Needless to say, with my track record as of late I was a little hesitant when a friend of mine recommended that we do lunch at Casa Reynoso. Despite my initial hesitation, I'm glad I took his word for it because this place exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The location was low-key and unassuming, clean, and had your typical Mexican restaurant atmosphere (including the music accented with accordion...something I'll never really get). The hostess, who was exceptionally cute by the way, not only helped us to our table, but also did double duty as a cashier, and then rounded out the triple play as our server. The chips and salsa were good, although as other reviews have stated, they do charge you beyond the first bowl. Apparently I was feeling adventurous, since I ordered not one, but TWO chicken dishes...I had a combo plate with a chicken enchilada, a chicken taco, and double rice as I don't mess with beans. The meal was solid, my favorite part was the enchilada with big chunks of tender, white meat chicken on top. The enchilada sauce had a hint of brown sugar, as my friend pointed out, and was different but good. The taco was decent too, with a crunchy shell that wasn't soggy from grease like most other places. Our server kept our glasses full, but sadly, disappeared by the end of the meal. Perhaps they decided to have her try her hand in the kitchen as well... Nonetheless, a solid four star experience and I intend to return in the future.

They suck at working on Japanese cars as well, they FAILED miserably at making some basic repairs on an old '93 Honda Accord I had several years back, and after going back to them four times they STILL couldn't get it right. If you give a sh*t about your car, DO NOT TAKE IT TO ANY SUN DEVIL AUTO LOCATIONS! Total scam artists.

I recently revisited Mi Patio, after having been introduced several years ago by my sister, and then forgetting about it almost entirely until I had a recent date who said she enjoyed Mexican food. Mi Patio happened to be close to another one of our destinations that evening, so it fit perfectly into my plans. After reading the reviews here beforehand, I decided to give the Baja Chicken Burro a try, and I must say, I will NEVER forget Mi Patio again. This thing was so delicious that it sometimes haunts me in my dreams! Seriously, it's THAT good. The chips and salsa were pretty decent, albeit a little heavy on the cilantro. Good food, fair prices, definitely worth a try if you haven't been there yet.

If you've read some of my other reviews for car dealerships, you'll probably draw the conclusion that I've been car shopping for the past couple of months. My current insurance company/lender (USAA) offers a "car buying service" that is designed to save you money on a new car purchase, and so after several failures at other dealerships I decided to give this option a try. I trust this company, and in turn, I trusted that the dealership they were affiliated with would likely be my best bet, which led me to Chapman Mitsubishi (aka Bell Road Mitsubishi) in a search for a new Evo. I was supposed to be able to purchase the car for $100 under invoice, a pretty good deal, and so when I pulled up and they had maybe 20 cars on the lot, I got one of those bad gut feelings. I had spoken to the liaison given to me by USAA's website, and expected the process to go smoothly, so I ignored it, and I went in to find him. After requesting him by name, the receptionist called him and I heard him answer in the back of the showroom, and immediately he tried to pawn us off on someone else. That person was unavailable, so he walked over with another guy who he did end up pawning us off on. They had me drive over to their Hyundai dealership so that my trade-in could be appraised, which is where the nightmare truly began. It took about 20 minutes for the used car manager to come look at my vehicle to begin with, which was totally unnecessary as this place was completely dead. Then after our short drive to ensure that my car was in perfectly functional condition, I was told to have a seat while this guy (who another employee claimed was 'the best in the business') put some numbers together. While I waited, I was then informed that because they didn't have the model I was looking for in-stock, that I wouldn't be getting the deal I was quoted online...then my salesman claimed he didn't know where they'd be getting the car from. I already did my research before going there, I knew exactly which dealership's stock they'd be pulling it from, so that was an outright lie. After waiting for over an hour, the salesman (read: scam artist) comes back with an offer for my trade. Now, before I go any further, let me make it very clear that I fully realize I will be getting bent over any time I try to trade in a used car, that's their job, and that's just how the industry works. However, in this case, the guy has the nerve to offer me $8k for a car that books anywhere between $22 - $33k. I waited for Ashton Kutcher and his camera crew to bust out from the employee lounge or wherever they set up their control room, but much to my surprise, I actually wasn't on an episode of Punk'd. That was really what they tried to offer me for my car. Now, I'd been lowballed on these offers before...I've been offered anywhere from $14.5, to $18, to $23k, but $8,000?!?! This was beyond insulting, and after waiting for over an hour to be insulted like this it was clearly time to walk out. I will never go back to this dealership, and I'd strongly encourage anyone who's considering buying a car from these shady scumbags to go elsewhere if you value customer service and being treated with respect.

Simply not acceptable. I drove through last night and the kid working the drive thru was too busy "rapping" about his "hustle" to a.) get my order right, and b.) give me my change. The Frosty I ordered was completely melted and might as well have been a lukewarm chocolate milk. This is quite possibly the worst Wendy's location in the area, the service here is consistently awful.

I made the mistake of going to this place with my girlfriend (at the time), her sister, and her sister's boyfriend. It was their goldfish racing night, and the concept had proven moderately entertaining at Monkey Pant's over in Tempe where I had experienced this previously. However, at this dump they give two complete losers (guys who looked like they were on the 10 year plan at ASU) live mics so that they can degrade the crowd. Now, I understand the concept of involving your audience and taking a few jabs at them here and there for comedic purposes, but these assholes were no comedians, nor were any of their comments particularly funny. The terms "lewd" and "disrespectful" come to mind first, and after making numerous comments about my girl and her sister, we decided to leave. No wonder half the reviewers report that there were no hot girls at this place. Apparently, witnessing the behavior of these cretins gave a pair of creepy old white trash knuckleheads in the crowd the idea that they too should throw out a few sexually aggressive and completely inappropriate comments towards our girls on the way out, which almost resulted in a beatdown that probably would have cost me some jail time had some staff members not intervened. The fact that any business would encourage this kind of behavior on behalf of their employees makes me hope that one day, this shitbox will burn to the ground. A douchebag who doesn't happen to be dressed in standard uniform (i.e. tacky Christian Audigier shirt, overpriced "designer" jeans, and sunglasses indoors at night) is still a douchebag.

This place deserves zero stars, to be honest, but unfortunately that is not an option. I'm surprised that this particular location has stayed open as long as it has, considering that everyone I've spoken with has had negative experiences there. During my particularly negative experience, I initially complained to the server, however understanding that she could do little to resolve the issue for me, I asked her to get the manager who was TOO LAZY to drag his fat, useless ass out of his office to deal with an unhappy customer. Instead he just sent the poor girl back out to try and handle it on her own. Worst management ever, I don't know where they find these clowns, but if anyone from corporate is reading this, I'd strongly suggest that you fire all of your managers and start from scratch. I can see why the staff is unhappy, if that's the kind of management they have to deal with.   The food is mediocre, the prices are too high unless you happen to make it for happy hour, and the "atmosphere" is a joke.

This is another one of my absolute favorite spots, I hit it up consistently at least once a week for lunch. My favs are the Dilly Club and their chicken noodle soup. Everything is super fresh, aside from the random slightly stale breadbowl (although if you get one that's super fresh, it's like heaven!) It can get a little hectic in there, especially during peak lunch times, but the service is usually pretty good, they've only messed up my order on two occassions and they corrected it promptly. If you haven't had a Dilly's experience yet, go with the half sandwich/small soup combo, the soups are phenomenal and they all go well with the sandiwches. I usually break down and get a cookie, too...the double chocolate or the M&M are both equally worth checking out.

I cannot, for the life of me, comprehend how or why this place consistently has one of the longest lines to get in damn near every weekend. It's a pool hall, and an average one at best...where's the attraction?!? It's usually cramped and uncomfortable, drinks were average, and the music sucked.

I remember trying Rosita's a long time ago and being pretty disappointed after a number of my friends had hyped it up pretty heavily...so today, as my co-worker and I debated over which Mexican place to try, I decided to give Rosita's another opportunity to win me over. For starters, the chips and salsa were pretty average. The chips were a little thicker than I prefer, and the salsa (at least in my opinion) tasted like a thin tomato base mixed with water. Very little spice, and not much taste at all. I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7.50, and I enjoyed the shredded beef...perhaps a bit dry, but it still had a decent flavor to it. The chicken, however, gave me flashbacks to my bad experience at Manuel's...although not quite as awful, it was very bland and lacked any real redeeming qualities. I still don't get how a place can f-up chicken! Jeeez. The spanish rice I had on the side was pretty standard, but all in all this was another pretty "bleh" dining experience. My dining companion just sent me an email to inform me that his bean burrito was already trying to make a comeback, I'm just glad I went double rice verus rice and beans. I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable.

A staple of Mill Ave. for years, Slices is the place to go when it's 2am, the bar has kicked you out, and you're still too drunk off of cheap well vodka to drive (or stumble) home just yet. Expect a crowd of like minded individuals, all of whom are hungry, and most of whom are at least a little beligerant. There's always potential for a couple dbags to get into a fight, so there may be some entertainment provided. Great for people watching, but unfortunately their pizza is pretty weak. Thin slices that sit out for way too long, only to be briefly reheated and served up slightly stale, usually very greasy. They do have some great toppings, their chicken has always proved pretty decent, and as a few other mentioned, they've got a good pesto option as well. All in all though, even when I am drunk here at 2am, I find the overall quality of the food to be sub-par. As for the service, well, if you had to deal with as many obnoxious, drunk college students as these guys did, you'd be in a hurry to rush as many assholes out the door as possible too.

I absolutely LOVE this place. Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!

This place cracks me up. A few years back, I had a pair of female friends who worked the beer tub while wearing their bikini's, and so I'd stop in from time to time to say hi and score a few free cocktails. At the very least, this was always an entertaining spot to do some people watching. They've both since moved on, and now the only reason I come here is when my friend has an overwhelming desire to experience what I like to call, his "T-Pain Moment". It's when he orders an Adios MF in one of their huge fishbowl chalice style and walks through the crowd, hallucinating that he's in a T-Pain video. I don't exactly get it, but I'm more than happy to help him fulfill this need from time to time, as long as we can get those "vip" cards so we don't have to pay to get int.   Overall, the place is a dump, it's pretty apparent that upkeep is half-assed and thus this becomes yet another spot with a TON of potential (love the overall layout, the big dancefloor, and the second level), but c'mon with the whole "baja beach party" theme. Long overdue for a remodel and a facelift, it could really go a long way.

This is another one of those Tempe/ASU spots that seems to be very popular, and yet for the life of me, I just don't get why. It is definitely a more chilled out in terms of the environment than the majority of your options directly off Mill, but it doesn't make it any less obnoxious or overcrowded. It's just a different type of obnoxious. You won't see any shiny shirts, designer jeans, or orange spray-tanned Jersey shore trash here, instead you'll encounter an entirely different species of douche at this establishment. THE HIPSTER DOUCHE. These guys with their American Apparel deep v-neck shirts, ironic mustaches, and overly tight girl-jeans are an equally repugnant group in their own right, I truly detest them and the fixed-gear bikes they rode in on. Throw in a few random haggard chicks and white guys with dreads to represent for the "this fad isn't over yet" pseudo hippies, and a couple sleeve-tattoo wielding bros and that sums up the demographic that is pretty consistent at this place.   Honestly, hanging out with these people is not my idea of a good time, and therefore neither is wasting my money on drinks at Casey's. I've never tried the food, so I can't comment on that, but the drinks I had were weak. Parking is a bitch, and the cops do tend to stake out the lot towards the end of the night in hopes of generating more revenue for the city of Tempe. I only gave it a second star because the idea of this place being suppossedly haunted intrigues me.

I've been going to this Fuddrucker's since early '09, and I hope that all of the issues that Tara M. brought up in her review have been addressed, it seemed fairly clean in the ten or so visits I've made this year. I dig their burgers, legit fresh quality ground beef cooked up on the spot works for me. The buns are delectable, and a perfect compliment. Nice condiment bar with a good selection of choices, and big, seasoned fries (wedge-style) round things out nicely.   Yes, the interior is kinda kitschy and tacky (long overdue for an update or total remodel), and the exterior is pretty dated, but I don't come here for those things. It's a little on the pricey side, but I'm willing to throw down a few extra bucks for the quality of food which has been very consistent here.

II would rate my experience with the San Palmilla property (owned/managed by Mark-Taylor) to be very average, and yet despite it's mediocrity, they expect you to pay high-end luxury prices. The pools and the fitness center were without question the major positive to the property, the apartment was less than what I'd expect for the overwhelming cost. Definitely some questionable tenants in other units close by, towards the end of my stay here (1 year lease) it seemed to lean more heavily towards college-aged ASU students (and 6/7 year senior jackasses), which resulted in more trash scattered about the grounds, and some more obnoxious pool parties. Also, for the love of all that is good, why does maintenance insist on weed-whacking outside of my window at 7am?!? I can't count how many times I considered homicide as a form of retaliation. Bottom line, there are better, less expensive options out there.

THESE SCUMBAGS DO NOT DESERVE YOUR BUSINESS!!! AVOID TEAM FORD AT ALL COSTS!  Here is my story: I contacted this dealer several weeks back about a vehicle they had posted on Autotrader, I first spoke with someone named Robert in their online sales department who quickly passed me and my inquiries along to Bill Jenkins after three days of phone tag. I asked Bill to send me some detailed pics of the vehicle, and a few days later he emailed me to say that the showroom floor was undergoing some renovations, and that he would send me the pictures shortly. An entire week went by, and nothing, so I call him and he claims to have sent the pictures, citing the size of the images as a reason that they may not have gone through via email. I ask him to resend, and I finally get them the next day, probably because he never took or sent them in the first place.  After seeing the pictures, I called and spoke with Bill, specifically asking for a few simple things...does the vehicle have all proper documentation, does it have service records, etc. It was late in the day, and he claimed that he couldn't check on these things, but would do so first thing Monday morning. I even sent him TWO email reminders so that he wouldn't forget (read: blow me off again). Well, Monday rolls around and I don't get a response. I let it ride until Thursday, and at this point I call again and he says that he doesn't have any docs or service records. One, I shouldn't have had to call and follow-up because he dropped the ball, and two, I honestly doubt he even checked. So then he tells me he'll try to contact the original owner and see if she has the docs, and he'll call me back. NOPE. Another lie.  So a few more days pass, now it's Saturday, I call back and ask for the General Manager. He proceeds to tell me they just sold the vehicle, he has no idea why I would have been passed along to Bill in the first place, and he would look into it and call me back. On Monday he did call back, but just to confirm that the car did indeed sell (they were waiting for a wire transfer of funds, supposedly).   Anyway, the bottom line is that these people are SHADY, LAZY, USELESS LIARS who epitomize every negative used-car salesman stereotype. I'm amazed any of these clowns even have a job if this is how they treat a serious buyer with cash in hand, who was ready and willing to make a 300 mile trip to buy a car from them.

Since Bill responded to my previous review, I wanted to see the record straight on a few things. First off, I'm not going to lose money taking two days off of work to then spend money driving to Las Vegas, to blindly purchase a car when you can't handle something as simple as answering several questions in an email. Much less, on a car that you're asking $5,000 OVER book value on, and that you can't provide some basic minimal documentation for?!? ALL I got from you was EXCUSES, even now you sent me a message claiming that you were "on vacation last week, which is why you couldn't get ahold of the original owner". Renovations on the showroom floor supposedly prevented you from taking pictures of the car for a week, then it was an "email issue", then when I finally DO get the pictures, they were taken outside anyway!   Then you try to blame your piss-poor customer service on ME? The reason it took me any longer than 24 hours to make a decision was because YOU failed NUMEROUS times to get back to me after you said you'd check on certain items that I inquired about and are perfectly relevant to making a purchase of this significance, especially over a long distance. Had you actually responded to me in a timely and professional manner, I had a mechanic lined up to inspect the vehicle, and I was ready and willing to make the trip out there.   Bottom line, if you treated your customers with respect than I wouldn't have gone WEEKS without answers to a few simple questions. The fact that you are still making these weak excuses, and then even have the audacity to try and blame ME for YOUR incompetence shows exactly what type of person I had to deal with, I just hope that this review can prevent others from having the same negative experience.

Went here for a company party a while back, so we had a private room and were limited to certain items set up buffet-style, so that's probably part of the reason I can only give it four stars at this time. Cheese crisp was ok, rice was decent, and the tacos were alright. I'm not a fan of bigger chunks of green peppers, onions, etc. mixed in with ground beef, and that's how they make theirs. I was a big fan of the salsa though, if you like it HOT there is no doubt that you must give Los Dos a try. I also have to give them credit for making a vicious Margarita. I didn't try one myself (I don't do tequila), however my dad who rarely drinks polished off two before our meal just to cope with the heat of the salsa, and ended up having ME drive home, with HIM hanging out the window like a teenage kid drunk on Mad Dog 20/20 for the first time! Absolutely one of the most hilarious nights of my life, and I have Los Dos Molinos to thank. Awesome!

Hate this place so much. It must be an employment requirement for any male (bartenders and bouncers) to be roid-monkey d-bags who spend more time flexing and hitting on chicks than actually doing a half-decent job. The space itself SUCKS, there are always people just standing everywhere, no traffic flow whatsoever, and it's a nightmare if you ever have to run the gauntlet in an attempt to take a piss in the tiny bathrooms located allllll the way in the very back. Navigating through a sea of ASU's finest collection of Affliction-wearing tools is not my idea of a good time. The only reason I can even justify a single star is because the "Zuma Juice" IS actually pretty tasty and cheap, there was one extremely hot female bartender, and Soloman holds a residency there and is one of the better dj's in PHX when you're in a forced top 40 environment. Otherwise, I generally try to avoid this place like the plague, while there are usually a few cute girls here, they're usually a bunch of vapid retards whose admittance into ANY college leaves me totally amazed.

They've got some great food over at Joe's, my favorite is the jumbo pulled pork sandwich, which I always order with some shredded cheddar cheese on top. I am a huge mac and cheese fan, but I don't really dig the whole breadcrumbs on top thing, which is really the only thing I can even come up with as a negative, aside from the fact that it gets a little pricey. Also, be wary of Sunday morning/early afternoon, as the line can extend the entire length of the building with the after church crowd (as I discovered today).

There probably isn't much left to be said about the awesomeness that is The Cornish Pasty Co. in Tempe, so I'll keep this brief. I'm a HUGE fan of the Cajun, it is absolute perfection with an amazing chipotle sauce that is the perfect compliment. Since I started going here, I've also come to enjoy starting off my meal with their garlic roasted potatoes (great to share with a friend). I've also tried the meat & cheese, which was great even though despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of sausage unless it's in a patty and comes next to some eggs and pancakes. Had a bite of the Italian as well, quite tasty in it's own right, although I picked out the big chunkier tomato, just a personal preference.  If the Tempe location is a bit cramped for you, and it DOES get pretty hectic in there sometimes, there's always their Mesa location which stays true to the formula but offers more seating room if you choose to dine in.   Don't make the mistake of not trying CPC at least once, I've introduced many friends (and even my parents) to this spot, and I've never gotten a single complaint. There is enough diversity on this menu that you can find someething for just about any range of tastes...hands down one of the most obvious 5 star reviews I've given.

Ah, the Cherry Lounge and Pit...very interesting choice of a name for this "lounge" with an identity crisis. I think the operative word here would be "PIT"...  This is the type of place that has SO much potential, and yet completely misses the mark. Where to even begin...first off, the smell. Never particularly pleasant, and this might be attributed to the crowd and not so much the venue itself, but nonetheless, it's a bad first impression. Speaking of the crowd, there are a lot of undesireable types here, and I'm talking about wannabe thugs, hood rats, and douchebags. It's a very common occurrence to see some bloated heifer up on one of their elevated stripper poles putting her cottage cheese-thighs and "Thursday" panties on a Saturday out on display for the shallow end of the gene pool. The go-go dancers here are generally nothing special, pretty average at best, we'll just say that the dim lighting works to their advantage. The VIP sections are laughable, if you were a real VIP this is probably one of the last places you'd show up.  Onto the dj's they have... First you've got dj Steele, who won't STFU on the mic which is not only annoying, but louder than his crappy music selection. Another time I was here there were two clowns playing together who woudln't stop doing the same three basic scratches every thirty seconds. Hey dummy, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but scratching is suppossed to accentuate the music, not BE the music. Once or twice I've been there for the dj/drummer combo, which was pretty well-executed.  Drinks were pretty average, not strong but not totally weak either. I know one of the bouncers here so we never pay or wait in line to get in, which is one of the only reasons my friends and I will kick it here on occassion.

I recently checked out the opening night of "UK Thursdays" here because they brought in Reid Speed (if you're unfamiliar, she's one of the top female dj's out there, plays mostly 2-step/speed garage, dnb, and dubstep), and I was curious to see how electronic music on Mill would play out. Before she took to the decks, there was a duo that goes by HavocNdeed that featured a dj paired with a drummer using V-Drums and triggering drum samples via Ableton...very cool, these guys made for a great opener. Reid brought it as always, and I had one of the best times I've ever had at Cherry, hence the improved rating...although it's more due to the people making this happen than the club, but nonetheless. I think promotion was maybe lacking a bit, turnout was kinda thin, but hopefully word gets out about this night because it has a lot of potential (I'm starting to sound like my elementary school teachers, aren't I?). Anyway, if you dig electronic music, make it a point to hit up UK Thursdays @ Cherry, you may be pleasantly surprised.

What a god-awful nightmare this place truly is. First off, TERRIBLE layout as has been stated by most of the people here thus far, complete fail at utilizing the space effectively. Also as mentioned previously, let me reiterate that the sound system SUCKS, which is completely ironic considering that this dump is suppossed to double as a "professional" recording studio. My pieced-together home stereo sounds better. The drinks are consistently weak, the bartenders have a tendency to overcharge your tab for drinks you didn't order. The atmosphere is just plain creepy and off-putting, which brings me to the biggest problem witht his venue...  Most of that creepiness you feel hovering over this place can probably be attributed to Jon, the balding-but-still desperately-trying-to-cling-to-my-youth part owner. This bi-polar, cheating, lying, sleazeball was constantly out of his mind (most likely the reason for the coke "rumors"), telling the most absurd lies and tall tales (how's that live music venue coming along...wasn't that suppossed to open back in '07?) while ogling any remotely attractive girl to cross his path, making any female patron completely uncomfortable. But wait, it doesn't stop there! I heard firsthand from two separate women that he attempted to sexually assault one of them (she was lucky enough to escape) and the other whom he actually physically struck! This guy is truly the scum of the earth, who sinks so low as to hit a girl? (Much less, one of his employees at the time!) I can only imagine what has gone on in the "vip" hot-tub (read: STD incubator) room behind locked doors...  Jon has successfully managed to burn countless bridges in this town, particularly with promoters who at one time worked for him (and inevitably got ripped off), to vendors (particularly liquor vendors, check out the weak selection and realize this is Jon's fault for not paying people), as well as his former employees (it doesn't take long to see through his front when you deal with him on a regular basis). Ultimately, it's because of Jon and his behavior that this place is such an epic FAIL.

The good: Fire-grilled chicken and steak, queso  The bad: everything else. The prices are higher than average for the whole "burrito assembly line" theme, and the salsa absolutely sucks, and by sucks I mean it literally made me want to vomit. The tortillas are so thick that the food just seems dry and bland. Overall pretty disappointing...

This was the first Barro's location that I tried in AZ, and even though I don't leave near it any longer, I sometimes swing through on my lunch break for a slice (or three). This stuff will definitely fill you up with it's thick crust, perfect sauce, and generous layer of cheese. I usually opt for pepperoni, but their sausage is pretty good as well. I've also had their boneless wings with medium heat, and they're not the best I've ever had but they'd rank somewhere in my top 5. At one point they switched their supplier for mozzarella sticks, which was a bit of a bummer, but otherwise I've always been happy with the experience. The only downside is that it's so good I tend to eat too much and feel like a fat, bloated bastard afterwards. Partially my fault, but partially theirs for making such a damn good pizza!

My friend and I both traded in vehicles and bought brand new Scion tC's from Camelback Toyota/Scion, and working with our salesman (who is no longer employed there) was an absolutely positive experience. However, once we settled on our deal, the finance manager was a total jerk, overly pushy with up-sells for extended warranties and other unnecessary crap. Despite that, I tried to remain loyal because of how helpful and friendly our salesman had been. When it came time for my first major service, I brought my car in and was upsold on over $500 of services that my personal mechanic later confirmed were 100% unnecessary, despite the pressure that the Camelback service writer had put on their "importance" to the proper upkeep of my vehicle. Even my salesman was disgusted with their behavior when I told him about it after the fact, which was one of the contributing factors for his decision to leave. I really hope that extra $500 you scammed me out of made it worthwhile to not only lose a good customer, but the several referrals I gave others to shop elsewhere. Stereotypical "stealership" b.s., and yet people in the automotive industry scratch their heads and wonder why they have such a piss poor reputation...

This is my local Chipotle, but they've always proven to be pretty consistent whenever I've ventured elsewhere. The ingredients are fresh, the service is usually good, and the prices are pretty fair for what you get. I usually go with three soft tacos so I can switch it up and get one chicken, one steak, and one barbacoa. Variety is good. I also can't resist their chips and medium salsa, something about that hint of lime and the salt they use just makes it too hard for me to say no. Admittedly, sometimes their food really does a number on my stomach, but it tastes so good that I usually just deal with the consequences later. It doesn't hurt that their is this absolutely gorgeous girl that works there too, which ensures that I make a trip at least once a week.

I was first introduced to Mango's by a coworker when I was employed by a company based in downtown Mesa. After quickly tiring of all the typical stuff in the area, I was excited to try something new and he mentioned that they had great salsa and $0.99 chicken tacos from 2-4. That was all that needed to be said, as those are two of my favorite things when it comes to Mexican food. Unfortunately, they no longer do the $0.99 chicken taco special (damn you, economy! This is the only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating, it's a little pricey for what you get) but I still make it a point to stop by from time to time and grub here. The salsa is indeed quite good, and the chicken tacos (while a little on the greasy side) are worth the trip.

Overrated. I would probably chose it over McDonald's or Burger King, but I fail to see what makes people go totally apesh*t over this place. The burgers are good, don't get me wrong, but they're nothing like what some people make them out to be. And what's with the lack of condiments? Blasphemy! Oh, and "spread"?!? WTF is this garbage that you're trying to pass off as an acceptable substitute for the variety of burger toppings that, for reasons I'm unaware of, aren't available here? Whatever this crap is, it's nasty.   Fries are average, and their shakes are ok (mine was a bit thin and runny). Reminds me of a low-budget Steak'n'Shake, which has MUCH better shakes and a lot more variety on their menu. (if only I could transplant one of these bad boys from the midwest...)  Again, even after eating here numerous times, I still fail to see how this place could even come close to living up to the hype. Sure, the whole "secret menu" was a genius marketing gimmick, but this place is mediocrity at best. If I want the best possible "fast food" burger, I'll go to Culver's which is far superior and gives it's patrons what we deserve...some freakin' choices!

If you enjoy watching flies that require ground clearance from the FAA prior to taking off buzz around you as you eat your "authentic" Mexican food, then you are in for a treat here!  As for me, I don't particularly enjoy dining in an establishment that clearly has no time for meeting some minimal health & sanitation standards. Disgusting.

I have to say, I absolutely LOVE Chronic Tacos. I was initially hesitant to check it out, but ever since my first experience I've been going back consistently. These days I hit it up at least once a week for their lunch special (a huge burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink for just over $8), sometimes even twice a week. Personally, I prefer the chicken, but the carne asada wasn't half bad either. Once I find something I like somewhere, I don't tend to venture too far outside of my "usual" order, so I can't really comment on much else on the menu. That said, the service is always good, the food is delicious, and there's always something at least moderately entertaining on the tv's. Seems like they've got a good selection of alcohol and beers, but I've never really gone there with the intention of getting drunk. Overall I gotta go with 5 stars, keep up the good work!

It takes a lot for a bar on Mill Ave. to impress me, because there is a lot of FAIL in the vicinity, but 301 is without question one of the best options for a night out. I feel that the $5 cover charge is particularly lame and unnecessary, there's never any amazing talent as far as dj's, bands, or performers, but I usually just deal with it because I'd much rather be here than some cramped, overhyped clusterf*ck like Zuma. I'm going to agree wholeheartedly that the female bartender's here are SMOKIN', usually hotter than most of the girls in the crowd on an average night. No complaints on that...  I love the outdoor patio here, definitely one of the best selling points of the venue itself. Overall the whole place is pretty spacious, the only major flaw is the dj booth with it's akward placement and the sound system is a bit weak. I'll add that it wouldn't hurt to update the place and make it a little more visually appealling overall, but whatever, certainly not a deal-breaker. Drinks are generally proper, and priced average. Bouncers and door staff have never been rude, and don't strike me as the typical roid-monkey variety, which is a plus.    As a whole, a nice change of pace if you're sick of the usual Mill b.s., but c'mon guys, let's cut the silly cover charge out of the equation.

For a fast food burger, this place is TOPS! Far superior to In'n'Out, which seems to be what a lot of people choose to compare it with. I guess it's like the whole Coke vs. Pepsi thing, except with burgers. And my choice is obvious. Tons of choices for toppings and condiments, fries are crinkle-style and tasty, and the selection of deserts is almost too much! Fresh food, friendly service, clean dining room and restrooms. Food takes a little longer than say, McDonald's, but it's well worth the extra minute. Give it a try, I think you'll be impressed.

I've been to this Salty Senorita three times to eat, and a few more with just the sole intention of getting drunk. After my most recent experience here, I can guarantee that I will not be eating here ever again, and it's highly unlikely that I'd be back to drink, either. Went in this past Sunday at about 3 in the afternoon with some friends, there were a total of maybe 20 people in the place, most of them posted up at the bar. Not busy whatsoever, which means there's no valid explanation as to why the service was so utterly slow. The salsa was bland (tried both the regular and the "hot"...which wasn't in any way), the food was overpriced for what you get, and what I got was the wrong order so I had to send it back (which I absolutely hate doing...I've seen "Waiting" a few times). Our waitress was as bland as the salsa, and the whole staff just seemed bored and annoyed that they were there. One of my friends who was starving didn't even finish half of his food, it was so awful, and when I finally got my order back the second time it was still not what I had asked for. At this point we just wanted to leave, so I gagged it down and we payed our bill, happy that this experience was finally over.

In the past I really enjoyed Great Steak, even though it's not a legit cheesesteak they usually tide me over. However, this particular location was terrible, one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Won't be back. EVER.

Another vinyl-retailer casualty...I'm sad to see it go, because I am pretty old school and I do appreciate being able to get good releases on wax, but truth be told, I only bought one record from this place in the 6+ years that I've lived here. I never came across much here that caught my fancy, but there was always an abundance of boring 4/4 house in just about every boring subgenre you could imagine(progressive, tech, blah blah blah).

Much like Victoria, my first visit to Cream wasn't all bad. It was on a Wednesday night, when GIANT (a well-known promotions group that brings out international dj talent) brought out Uberzone. When we first presented our id's to security, and they radio'ed in "code four" I should have taken that as a bad omen, but I just joked with the guy and said, "what's that mean? Are we special? No cover for us tonight?" (He didn't find it that amusing, and I still have no idea wtf a "code four" is...but I do know that these jerk-offs in cheap suits needed to get over themselves and realize that "bouncer" at a Scottsdale nightclub is only a notch above the guy who cleans the spunk off private booths at the strip club.)  Right off the bat, I noticed a few things that were clearly not well-thought out when the club was designed. 1.) Who's the genius who decided to put those obnoxious "drink holders" in the middle of the dancefloor space? It's like a steel bar, just wide enough to accomodate a pair of cocktails, otherwise it serves no purpose aside from preventing people from dancing and enjoying themselves. 2.) The "VIP" booth right in front of the dj. Hey idiots, I didn't come to your club and pay your overpriced cover to watch a bunch of douchebags and self-important losers mingle. I came to see and hear the DJ that you probably paid thousands of dollars to bring out and headline the evening, and now I can't see jack because you thought it would be a good way to drum up some more bottle service revenue? HUGE design flaw. 3.) Speaking of your bottle service, is the sparkler in the ice bucket really necessary? I guess if you're going to pay a couple hundred dollars for a $12 bottle of alcohol, Cream would like to announce to the entire club that you lack any common sense or money management skills? Hmmm...  Regardless, I got decent service from the bartenders and was able to salvage a decent night out of it. If that had been my only experience there, I probably would have gone with three stars to be generous, however...I went back about a month later. This time around GIANT had brought out dj Icey, again I went on a Wednesday night and immediately upon walking up I watched the meathead bouncer turn away two guys and a girl because the dudes had hats on. When we got to him, he told me no hats, no exceptions. We stepped out of line and I made a few phone calls to try and resolve the issue, but without much luck. Then I watched as he let some skanky blonde in wearing a beat up mesh trucker hat, at which point I approached him again and said not only did you just let HER in with a hat, but I was up here on a Wednesday night less than one month ago and I had absolutely NO problems wearing one. With an obnoxiously smug look on his face, this knuckle dragging primate tells me he's not letting me in, and then out of nowhere this dude who overheard the conversation (and happened to be one of the promoters) stepped in and told the bouncer "hey, it's a Wednesday night", and their shouldn't be any issues over a hat, dress code was suppossed to be "relaxed". Ah, looks like you don't hold all the power now, huh rope monkey? This jackass who didn't even know the dress code policy for the club must have turned away at least 10 other dudes while we held our ground, not to mention, I spent over $100 at your stupid club, I can only imagine how much revenue was lost by all the people he turned away. The doorman/security is the first contact you have at just about any venue, why most clubs in Arizona don't get the importance of the initial impression they give to the customer is beyond me.   Other problems include the bathrooms (the automatic sensor in the sinks is awful and yet another poorly thought-out design flaw), the overhyped sound system that they don't run anywhere near full capacity, and the fact that the crowd becomes more degenerate each time I've gone (I'm a glutton for punishment, I've actually wasted three nights there).  The only way I'll ever waste my time and money on this dump is if they bring in talent that I just can't pass up...but it would have to be pretty f'in spectacular to get me out after my previous experiences here.

In the Anthem area, you are somewhat limited in your options when it comes to decent pizza. This is what led us to venture over to the Mellow Mushroom yesterday, as we decided that it was time to investigate this new spot. Around 6pm the place was pretty busy, but there were a few open tables still left and we were seated with the quickness at a booth near the bar. They have several nice, flat screen tv's and we got to catch part of the beating that the Sabres gave the Coyotes. As others have pointed out, it's not exactly quiet inside, but I didn't presume that I was going to be dining at a library so this didn't really bother me. The restaurant was clean and looked nice and new, so no complaints on the atmosphere from me.  Now for the important part...the food. We ordered several items to share so that everyone could sample a few different things. As for the pizza, I thought it was decent, with a thicker dough-y crust and a nice, sweet sauce. I tried a bit of the Italian sandwich, and I was impressed with the real mozzarella, not bad, but I don't really dig onions and this sandwich had a lot of 'em. I also had about half of a meatball sub, and this was the highlight of my meal, it was just right and really hit the spot. Service was excellent, and I can only assume that they'll continue to get better as the place was still fairly new. Nice work, Mellow Mushroom, we'll be back.

Food is awesome, portions are absurdly huge, and the service is usually on point. That said, this is my go-to spot for a 1pm breakfast after a serious Vegas hangover, the only complaint I have is that the music is obnoxiously loud and has a nasty effect of intensifying the hangover...still worth a 5 star though. Definitely worth a visit if you've never checked it out!

I've been patronizing this recently opened Mr. Goodcents for the last couple weeks now, and I find myself really enjoying their Penny Club (I opt to add some bacon) sandwich. The sandwich, while not necessarily on par with something that you'd get from, say, Dilly's Deli, but I feel that it is definitely a step or two above the garbage they serve at Subway. The quality of the meats is an improvement, and as mentioned previously, I like the fact that it's sliced fresh in front of me instead of  peeled off a stack that's been overprocessed and probably full of all sorts of nasty preservatives and chemicals. I've also tried the pasta (chicken fettucini alfredo and chicken parmesan), which is passable but nothing to write home about, and the garlic bread was pretty disappointing. Their chocolate chip cookies, on the other hand, redeemed them after the weak garlic bread experience.

I'm giving Smashburger a 5-star rating primarily for the quality of service I received when eating there recently for my first time. The guy working the register was friendly, and when I was 77 cents short he covered it for me, thus saving me a trip back to the car and another hit on my debit card. The girl who brought us our food was also very hospitable, getting me several condiments for my fries, and even suggesting I try their chipotle sauce (which I did, and it was decent). She also offered to get me a to-go cup for my drink when she noticed we were finished with our meals. It's rare, especially these days, to feel like the employees actually enjoy their jobs and take pride in making sure that the customer has a good experience.   As for the food, I got a 1/2lb BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and it was pretty damn good. Reminded me of a Fuddrucker's burger moreso than, say, In'n'Out or Five Guys, definitely a little different than the norm when it comes to burger joints. I had the Smash Fries, which I thought were delicious with the seasoning they used.  If you are looking for a burger but you're sick of the norm, give Smashburger a try, you might just be pleasantly surprised as I was.

So many things wrong with this place, let's start with what you experience when you enter the club. One of the first things you'll notice will be a group of security guards standing around bs'ing with each other. That's pretty much all you'll see them do, however on occassion, they'll hit on some of the female customers, or even have the audacity to ask people for drugs (I'm not even kidding, I saw this happen SEVERAL times...and it was not to "bust" anyone, it was clearly for their personal consumption). The worst part is when they choose to get aggressive with a customer and drag them out to the street where they continue their assault until the Tempe PD show up and take over. Now don't get me wrong, I want security to handle unruly patrons when it's necessary, but these guys are so bored out of their minds that I'd venture an estimate that 75% of the time, their actions are completely unwarranted. Plain and simple, neither myself nor my friends felt even remotely safe. The line moves slowly, but once you get inside you can see that this place hasn't been properly cleaned in years. Check out the inch of filth on the drumset at the top of the stairs. Disgusting. The decor is equally gross, from the holes in the walls, to the horrible paintings, to the lack of any baseboards or trim at the bottom of the walls. Bathrooms are vile, of course I've only been in the men's room, but they usually have at least one urinal that's "out of service", they never have any paper towels, you're lucky if one of the dispensers has any soap in it, and there's usually a bathroom attendant burning some nasty incense to try and mask the stench. Back in the main room, the bartenders are average, clearly any females there are hired more for their bra size than their ability to do their job. The only highlight behind the bar is a guy named Kenny, dude was hilarious and the only employee with a smile on his face (how anyone could remain positive working in this environment is beyond me). The cocktail server we had in the VIP overcharged us for a bottle, and my friend thinks that she swiped a hundred dollar bill from his pocket while she was groping him in an attempt to get a bigger tip. The DJ was some clown from 101.5 with an overblown ego, and was probably largely responsible for the predominantly ghetto crowd on the weekends. Soundsystem was a joke, you could hear the blown speakers rattling in the cabinets, and the jackass in the utility belt on a power trip who was "running" it clearly has no clue what he's doing. I couldn't tell if this dork was their sound guy, a security guard, or a janitor since he seemed to be doing all three, the whole time making sure to be rude to customers and displaying a terrible attitude problem. Any positive reviews on this place were clearly written by people who work for the venue, do yourself, your friends, and your wallet a favor, AVOID THIS DUMP LIKE THE PLAGUE!

I've been to several "self-wash" places with my dog in the past few years, and I have to say, Wag'n'Wash is definitely tops. The facilities are always clean, the staff is always helpful, and my dog always leaves looking 100% better than when he came in. I usually opt for the de-shedding wash as my dog is a large breed with a healthy coat of fur that requires me to vacuum my place on average once a day. If you are sick of breaking your back washing your dog in your bathtub, stop by Wag'n'Wash and see why it's worth the money to clean your mutt here instead!

A friend of mine had hyped this place up for the past week and so I was definitely excited to take it for a test drive. When we arrived, it was during lunch hours and the place was pretty busy, but we walked right up to the front and placed our order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger, and let me tell you, this thing was no joke! I asked for extra crispy bacon, mayo, and ketchup and everything was prepared as I had requested. Lots of flavor, two thick and  juicy patties, and enough grease to power an alternative fuel vehicle...quite tasty. Between three of us, we split a small order of Cajun fries and they were pretty decent. The thicker the cut of the fry, the soggier they were, but not bad. Our food was prepared quickly, and the service was good for being as busy as they were. As mentioned, this isn't the most cost effective meal if you're on a budget, but for the quality of the food I'm ok with that. Will definitely be back when I need a burger fix for lunch. Nice work, Five Guys.

I also had a pretty negative experience here. A few months after getting bent over on unnecessary upsells by Camelback Toyota and their shady service department, I decided to give Big Two a try since they had a brand new facility and were much more convenient in terms of their location. I brought my vehicle in for a standard oil change, and lo and behold, the service writer comes back to me with claims that I need to flush my fluids and have additional work performed. I told them absolutely not, just finish my oil change and that's all I have the time and money for today. He continued to try and talk me into these unnecessary additional services, unaware that I'd already fallen for that trick once at Camelback, and there was absolutely NO way my car required these bogus services (again!) only a few thousand miles later. These people are crooks, my guess would be that they adhere to these business practices to help pay for their nice, new facility...but quite frankly, I'm not gonna help you foot the bill for it by paying for imaginary services that I don't need.
