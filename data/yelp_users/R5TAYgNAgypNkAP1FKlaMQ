I booked an appointment online using FastMeds website, apparently there is a disclaimer stating what you book online may or may not be available when you arrive. I arrived 15 minutes early and when my online booked time came and went I asked.  I was told people were here before me even though I arrived well in advance of my online scheduled appointment.  That is BAD business!!! So this is just terrible, I did the right thing and made an appointment because I am a responsible person and I didn't want to leave work until I had too, but this company does you no service!

This place is awesome, the location is not so desirable. But, wow the food and preparation technique is fantastic. The quality and quantity of food for the price is perfect!  If you have a chance to order the pork belly you certainly won't be disappointed, and a side note the coffee is always on point!

So I decided to try a new location because the other location was terrible, guess what?  Same crumby experience! I made my appointment using the companies zip pass online tool. I arrived 10 min before my scheduled time.  No one was waiting or being treated. I completed the standard paper work and began my wait. Waiting and waiting and waiting.... I waited in excess of 45 minutes from my scheduled time to even be called back? I don't get it, if you have a patient in your lobby and you aren't seeing anyone what is the problem? When I was finally called back the person was so un friendly and had an accusatory tone, this company is an absolute joke! After total wait of 70 minutes I was seen for 3 minutes!!!

Let me start off by saying this place is a great bar!  the atmosphere is very unique and fun for all.  Tonight we took the family and wanted to try the food, it was busy but we had time to spare.  We had a couple of drinks and waited for a table to sit outside.  We were seated and everything seemed nice, we found items on the menu that looked great and we were excited to have them arrive  About, 25 minutes later the entrees arrived.  Everything looked really good when it arrived, I took a bite of my $14.00 burger, and low and behold all I could taste is salt.  I think it was dropped into and open vat of salt???  I grabbed the waiter and asked if it could be re-made, he had no problem taking it back. I started to watch the clock as my family was eating their food, but my remade burger took 22 minutes to be brought out.  I immediately ask for a box and my wife and kids were ready to leave.  Just before I put the burger in the box I decided to check to see if it was made correctly, mind you I always order my burgers medium rare.  I cut into the burger to check and see if it was pink and it was as well done as you could make it without burning it.  I immediately flagged the waiter down as I was just angry at this point I asked him to please take it back and take the item off my bill, which her did but no apology was offered or any other gesture of courtesy.  As we were getting ready to leave a manger walks over and asks if I was the one that had burger problems. Mind you still no apology!  I start to express my displeasure with the events of our attempt at a family dinner, she stops me mid sentence and says "can I give you a gift card?"  First of all, still no apology and the lack of empathetic customer skills is atrocious.  I stop explaining and just say "yes that will be fine."  Not sure I want to go back even if it is free!

It's all about the Beer and the Pig Wings! If you don't understand go and order it, you'll never want a chicken wing again!

Initial experience is very good and they just opened lasted week. The 2 men that run the place are very nice and knowledgeable. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous very well done!
