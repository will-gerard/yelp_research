Green is my absolute favorite place to eat on this earth! You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. It's all delicious, from the wonderful appetizers, to the amazing salads, to the entrees with mock meat. And don't leave without trying one of the scrumptious desserts. Everything is priced very reasonably and that staff is always smiling and helpful. I wish I could eat here every day! Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or meat-lover, try this place out. You will NOT be disappointed!

Soooo....I came across this place on Yelp and saw that it had 4 out of 5 stars.  I tried to click on the link to bring up the written reviews, but for some reason I was unable to get the app to respond.  This was unfortunate because we probably would have gone elsewhere for breakfast had I been able to read the negative comments beforehand.  However, we experienced Essence for ourselves, expecting the quality and service that we have enjoyed at other establishments that are rated so highly.  Sadly, we were disappointed,  and now that we are able to read the customer reviews,  we can testify that the multiple reports of poor customer service and undercooked food are honestly written.   The woman who took our order at the register was not friendly.  She did not greet us with a smile. She seemed annoyed and asked "What can I get for you?", then rudely interrupted me several times while I was trying to order.  When she handed me the receipt to sign, there was no place to add a tip, and when I asked about it she responded in a scolding manner, "You would have had to tell me before I ran the card." I'm used to being able to add a tip to the receipt,  or being asked if I would like to add one if it needs to be run through with the purchase.  We waited about 40 minutes for the food to arrive, and my "scrambled" egg was like an omelet that was lightly cooked on the outside and literally runny inside. I asked if I could have it cooked more thoroughly.  10 minutes later my plate was returned with a replacement egg that was not cooked any more than the original. Once more I sent it back to be cooked, and this time it was returned to me burnt on the outside and barely done inside. At this point, I gave up. The french toast and syrup that came with it was cold.  The milk that was poured over the granola was warm. The prices were high and the "service" was not anywhere near my definition of service.  We were unimpressed and won't be back.

I had expected from a place that specialized in them. We ordered brunch items, and they were good, but quite over priced in my opinion. We spent $75 for breakfast for my little family of four. I would say our meal was worth about half that. It took over 45 minutes for our food to be served after we ordered. The server wasn't very friendly our helpful. Overall, we were excited to try this place, but in the end we were quite disappointed and we won't be visiting again.

We picked up an order of bacon wrapped scallops to go on one evening. They were delicious. I was impressed by the atmosphere when picking up the order, and the quality of the food, so we decided to return the following day for dinner. It was happy hour, so we tried several items off of the happy hour menu. The sushi was excellent. We also ordered some salads that were very good. The waitress was friendly and helpful. We will return when we are in the area again.

Highly recommended! This company does professional work. They arrived on time for the estimate as well as the installation appointment. They did neat, clean work. The installers were courteous. We love the way our house looks with the shades on. They keep our home cool and private. We're very pleased with our investment.

I have no idea what other people ordered here that tasted good enough to give it more than one star. We ordered 2 different pasta dishes, 2 different wraps, and a smoothie. All 5 items were very unappetizing. The noodles in the pasta dishes were severely overcooked. The wraps tasted terrible. One of them was completely inedible due to ridiculous amount of hot sauce it contained. The smoothie had no flavor at all. Food quality aside, the environment was awkward and unclean. Yuck!

BEWARE! The restaurant you are reading wonderful reviews for is NOT the restaurant you will be visiting, should you choose to dine here. Be prepared to pay twice as much for completely different food that is shown on the menu here on Yelp. I honestly felt scammed, having been here several months ago and enjoying everything about the restaurant, only to return to the same restaurant under the same name, and find that everything has changed. Perhaps the new owner should reopen the restaurant with a new name. That would be the honest thing to do. The new menu is fine if you're expecting limited options of items you may not be able to pronounce, and are willing to ask plenty of questions about what is offered, and then receive a tiny portion of food for a large chunk of change. We dropped $45 for a small entree, a side, and a minuscule salad? The food we received was mediocre overall, with poor value for the price paid. The service we received was mediocre as well. Needless to say, we won't be going back. The new owner should make an ethical decision to be open with the public about the complete changes that have been made. The previous reviews and menus should really be removed from Yelp.
