Best place to go and relax with some friends. The outdoor seating is fantastic with super comfy chairs and couches.   The waiting staff is always attentive and has rarely lapsed on refills or food.   The selection of drinks is simply mind-blowing. They have something like 150 beers on tap. Try the Young's Berry. Superb drink!   Food is varied and very good. The sliders are always a safe bet and the fries that come with them are delicious. Also they have a lettuce wrap that must be tried to be believed.  All in all a great place to go and hang out.  Make sure you go during happy hour, otherwise the price for the drinks adds up fairly quickly.

Chipotle is one of the best places. I love the location of this one and they aren't greedy with the chicken here. Also, it is right next to the theatre and several other shopping places. All in all, it was as great as it always is.

Great little diner. Prices are very reasonable. You get a ton of really great food for less than a lot of other places. Warning: you will never see bigger pancakes than the ones here. You will Def want to share.
