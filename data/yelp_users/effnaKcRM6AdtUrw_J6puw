Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Z Pizza or even Oreganos. All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like:  I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza.   While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, "Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro." I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, "No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!" To which I replied, "Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza." To which he replied, "Well, the new pizza will be here shortly," as he walked away.  I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted. Finally, I believe arguing with the guest should be strictly avoided.   Man, what a twat!

Thairama has a Thai family cooking family thai food. That says more than I could, especially in Phoenix.  Thai Greece curry vegetable came with Bok Choy, broccoli, jalapeño, carrots, Napa cabbage, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, green beans, and baby corn in coconut sauce. Veggie lovers dream!  Told them I didn't need/want the rice and they threw an egg roll in just because. I think that speaks a lot about how unrude these folks are.  Thanks for being awesome.

To be fair, we didn't eat there. We went in and the place reeked of that orange spray. We still tried to man through it and preceded through the cracked walls, dirty floor, and blinding flourescent lights. When we got up to the counter, the worker said, "Everything is to go." it was 30 minutes til close. More concerning... the counter smelled like sewage. so we turned around and got out of there.

These folks are a staple in the Phoenix area and don't really need my review. Good healthy eats in a happy hipster vibe. Super reasonably priced with an eclectic Mediterranean based menu. They've got the to-go process down to a science. *they have to-go Sriracha on the ready!!!  If you've been to any house party, BBQ, or bat mitzvah in the past decade you're probably as tired of hummus as I am. Skip it. Try the baba ganoush or the garlic dip. Super veg friendly. Love you.

Phenomenal! If you ever went to that's Italiano (location's prior restaurant) you'll be amazed by the difference. I had the bass which changes daily but mine was inventive and flavorful.   Start with a beet purée, add braised bok choy, roasted cauliflower and baked garbanzos. Other dishes at the table- short ribs, burger, and beef bourguignon shepherd's pie. Everyone was stoked!  Handcrafted cocktails, hearty farm-to-table dishes. Go! If you don't have plans after go for the fig pecan pie and let me know how it is.

We went in... The hostess and owner were welcoming. The bartender was not. Communication seemed to be lacking. We ended up going around the corner to Delux which has a new Zen32 inspired sushi bar - they even have the same sushi chef (and happy hour) as they did before. Great service - Great Food!!! Interestingly enough we met up with some kids that said they had the same experience we did at Central Bistro. Who knows - maybe they'll get it together.
