THE BEST sandwiches in all of Arizona. Only blocks from home, I've been known to walk here for a cheesesteak. Their homemade pizzelles are great. The people here treat you like family, whether you have been here once or twice or are a regular.

LOVE this place. It is my "go to" deli and grocery store when I need that special Italian item I cannot get anywhere else. Italian wedding cookies, cannolis, pizzelles and coffees. Great selection of salads and pasta items in the deli.

My daughter was in this Kinkos today to get oversized copies made. They scanned her items and only told her AFTER they were scanned that the price was going to be $70.00. She is a college student, and this was a shock for her. They should have AT LEAST told her what the cost of the services she was requesting was in advance so she could have made an informed decision. After they already made the scans, it was a little late to say, no, you are too frigging expensive. We WILL NOT be using this Kinkos ever again, I don't care if it is right near campus. I will drive 10 miles to Staples or OfficeMax first before setting foot in this place again. $70 for two copies. Insane.

Avoid these shysters at ALL COSTS. My car had a burnt up clutch one day after the 15 day warranty, putting my life in danger. This bunch of crooks said, oh, not under warranty, not our problem, but offered their mechanic to "fix" it at wholesale. Not admitting any guilt in putting a car in that condition on the lot for sale. Wouldn't identify the  mystery mechanic, gave me no information on repair or parts or warranties, just a bill. Two months later, the turbo on the engine went, costing me another $4000. This car was advertised in "pristine" condition. I am assuming that means they washed and vacuumed it. The REAL mechanic I took it too said they never even bothered to change the oil or give it a tuneup before they sold it to me. And when you complain to t hem, all you will get is the "sorry, after the 15 day lemon law warranty not our problem." Knowing full well that the car was sold in poor condition, knowing that they'd lied about it, knowing that whatever went wrong would be after the 15 days and they wouldn't have to do a thing. Might not be illegal, but unethical as hell. These guys are the lowest of the low.

I bought the lemon car from this dealership over a year ago. I have spent THOUSANDS in repairs, and have verification from the original dealership on the horrible condition it was in mechanically when sold to me. This dealership continues to threaten me and slander me and post these nasty comments and responses more than a year later. Shouldn't they be working on improving their rep instead of kicking this dead horse? Shows what jerks they really are. Get a real job boys.  Now, almost two years after I have purchased this car, after I have had validation from the original dealership about the poor shape it was in when it was sold to me, they continue to bash me here, and claim I am "slandering" them when they absolutely will not own up to anything they claimed, anything they promised, or the agreements we made about my trade in, which they had COMPLETE information on. More lies from these slimeballs. I am amazed they are still in business.

What a flake. I called three or four times to check on when they were coming. Was given one time that passed. Called back and was told it would be another hour. Called back two hours later, got some woman on the phone who sounded drunk, who said the guy didn't feel well and went to the ER. Thanks for letting ME know, while we waited and waited and waited and WAITED for you to show up. Never again.

My daughter went to Mood Swings at the Scottsdale location. They quoted her $40 for the services she requested over the phone. When all was said and done, the charge was almost $100, and the makeup job they did was so awful we can to come back home, wash it off, and start over. I would never recommend this snooty place to anyone. Ever. And I had to lose $100 to find that out. NEVER AGAIN.

First visit to the new second location of Pro Nails by Julie on McDonald and Granite Reef in Scottsdale. Excellent and attentive service. Friendly staff does beautiful work. They take their time and pay attention to your needs. Was very happy with the final results, so much better than the last overpriced "fancy" place we went to. I have found a new nail place!!!!!

My daugher and her boyfriend brought home a menu and I HAD to go and try the loose burger. IT WAS THE BEST. Also stole a taste of my daughter's coney dog, which was excellent. And I would drive all the way across Tempe for the fries! Great atmosphere, great people. I admit to loving the opportunity to wipe my feet on Ohio State.

Add Kona 13 to one of my favorite places in my new neighborhood!! Creative flavors, baristas who know their stuff. Tried the Tiramisu flavor today, and am going to go down the list and try everything!
