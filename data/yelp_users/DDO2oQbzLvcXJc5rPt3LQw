The food in general has been great. But they mess up on our order almost every other time. The customer service was great until as of late where we had someone talk back to me and say it was our fault and that we ordered the pizza wrong. When in reality I ordered it correctly. It's a shame, we didn't even eat the pizza because the toppings were wrong and the customer service was so terrible. Looks like we'll be sticking with Pizza Hut.

New specialty chicken was really good. The thin crust pizza I ordered was amazing and the service was exceptional. Much more cheerful than last time.

Always liked Fatburger, the traffic at this location seemed slow, but the service was still exceptional.

Had the grilled chicken avocado panini and the tex-mex salad, both were amazing. Really wish there were more places like this around the valley.

Probably the best doughnut I've ever had. Can't go wrong with any flavor because the doughnuts are made on site as you order it.
