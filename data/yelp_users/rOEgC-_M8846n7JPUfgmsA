DO NOT I repeat DO NOT go to this location! I usually go to the one on frank Lloyd wright because that's right around where I work,but I live near this one so I thought I'd try it out. First off the aesthetics of this one are quite displeasing and unfriendly. The retail here is a better selection but I would buy my lotions online if I were you. I got a mystic tan for the first time and it turned out a nightmare!! It was extremely streaky and a bit orange-y. It felt as if the machine was only spraying one side of me and sure enough it looks that way too. I also had to blot dry a couple of areas because it didn't dry while in the machine. Needless to say I'll be going back to versa. I definitely feel like the staff was unfriendly and like I was waisting their time just by being there. If I could give them 0 stars I would...

I absolutely LOVE this place. Everything comes out great and the service is awesome. They make my food the way I order it and it comes out in a timely manner. I also take advantage of their order out and pickup window. I've become a regular here (meaning 2-4 times a month) and they know exactly what I order and I don't even have to restate my specifications, which is great!

First off let me preface this by saying that I'm a licensed cosmetologist and I still have a station elsewhere. I also have super thick and curly hair that can be hard to handle sometimes, so I'm super picky about who touches it.   I started coming to this salon because I went to cosmetology school with Thom. I loved getting my haircut with him then and also still love it. One day his schedule was busy so I decided that I'd take a leap of faith and try someone else. They chose Breanne for me. I was very cautious but still went with the flow. She made some recommendations and I went with them and was greatly pleased. I booked a very dramatic color change with her for the next time and I absolutely loved the results!! I get so many compliments now on my color and cut daily that it can sometimes be annoying. But I cannot say enough good things and compliments about this salon. If I weren't a part time stylist I'd apply for a position here. Everything I see come out of this salon is 5 stars.   Take a chance. Make a change. It might just be the one you need and the one you love

These guys have been nothing but helpful. They didn't take advantage of me at all. They fixed my cat converter in an hour which is very impressive since it is welded on. I went back so they could work on my brakes and rotors which took them about an hour and a half. They didn't charge me a dime more for what they had quoted me over the phone. I recommend them to everyone I know!

The last two times I went here for a brazilian (which I'm used to getting one every 3 weeks), and I left with a lot of pain and there was still wax left on me. I used to go to Alicia (who was awsome) and when she left they scheduled me with someone else and didn't bother to confirm with me if it was okay until I arrived. Not cool. I will no longer be going here as I have found somewhere cheaper, less painful, and with better customer service.

Completely tried to take advantage of me by quoting me way above a regular price. Plus I waited an hour just for them to give me a quote. Will not ever go to this location again!

The owner was very helpful. I went in told her what I was looking for and my price range. She had me take a seat and within 15 minutes she was done and I'm a happy camper!

Called in the morning and was able to get seen within the hour. Saw Lyssa for my braz and it was quick and as comfortable as a braz wax gets!! Five stars from me!  They also have options for online reservations and payment arrangements for over 150$!

I absolutely crave the pork barbecoa burrito. This place is always busy since it opened. I recommend calling in your order if you're just picking up to bypass a very long wait time.

Omg!!! I love this place! The owner is so inviting and nice. The food is delicious. I had the spring roll and pad Thai and it was out so quickly. Probably the fastest I've been seated and served in a restaurant. Just the right amount of crunch and flakiness in the spring roll. The flavor in the pad Thai was perfect, not too spicy, and the presentation was very eye catching. Young and hip decor, and they serve alcohol. Two thumbs up and five stars. I'll be coming back for sure.
