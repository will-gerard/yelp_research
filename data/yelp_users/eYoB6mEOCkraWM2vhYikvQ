We arrived at 2:30 with a craving for something that wasn't mexican food or contemporary food. We were seated and told there was a lunch all-you-can-eat buffet going on. We looked over the menu but decided after all on the buffet, it was a good idea to try some new things since I always get matar paneer.   I filled a plate and proceeded to stuff my face.. in classy form, of course. The Aloo Mattar had the perfect amount of spice and an immense amount of flavor. It was impressive, as was the chicken curry, the rice, and the chicken masala. I was in heaven! The garlic naan was perfect. Everything was right with the world..  Then the bad news came. Not fifteen minutes after we sat down with our first plates filled were we told the buffet was going to close soon. Had we known earlier, well, I'm not sure what we would do. But it sure is lucky we are a couple of small ladies who can't really eat more than one overfilled plate.. I thought.  I finished my plate and decided to have more aloo mattar, rice, and then some raiti and fritters. Then I got some of the coconut basmati rice. Oh everything just.. sighhh. I think it was the first time I've really been rendered speechless by food in a long time.   tl;dr Service was friendly but didn't come around often enough to fill our drinks, food is incredible, the place is relaxing and aesthetically appealing inside.  They lost a star for the failure to tell us we had fifteen minutes to enjoy the buffet and for being a little lagging on the refilling of drinks.

Stopped in after enjoying some gelato next door. Immediately I felt like I wasn't in Phoenix at all, but Olympia.. except the whole local-coffee-shop thing was done better at Hava Java. Dim lighting and the slim layout keep it cozy, and there are tables outside as well. I didn't have the coffee, but ordered an italian soda and FOR ONCE it was made the proper way: fizzy, not loaded with half and half, and hardly sweet. Very refreshing! Also I should add our barista was pretty cute.. a cafe is ten times better when you have some eye-candy in there. I'll review it again after I have the coffee and sit and enjoy it a bit.. until then though, it doesn't feel fair to get five stars.

Met up with a few friends here yesterday afternoon. The decor is awesome! Artsy, minimal, lots of windows and candles. I like the seating: sectional modern couches around rustic tables. I split the bruschetta sampler with my friend [tomato jam, roasted pepper, prosciutto, and salami]. Delicious! It was unlike any appetizer I've had. Very flavourful and different. The tomato jam was especially impressive.   Staff is good, my water never went empty, and the atmosphere is very cool. Five stars when I try the wine.

I'm so picky when it comes to my pedicure and I have always found my self skipping around to find the place with the best service, most calming atmosphere, and at least a semi-conscientious staff. My journey ends today.  Cruising around our feet were literally itching for a scrub, not to mention some fre$h lacquer. Walking in it's a small nail salon, quiet, with a total of 5 beauticians on staff. Nice large selection of polishes, even some less-used colors like yellow sparkle or lilac purple. We were seated in spas instantly and were asked if the water was too hot. I like that, I've had my poor feet burned before.   The beauticians were very conversational and nice, and I like that too, because I'm a weenie. Huge weenie. I hate the pokes and prods of having cuticles clipped and calluses shaved. So the conversation was a welcome distraction and boy.... what comfy chairs. I was in bliss....   Out of nowhere, I am informed I have an ingrown toenail and instantly I feel it getting yanked-- O U C H! I mean, I don't know if there's a nice way to remove an ingrown toenail but my friend's experience seemed more pleasant.. It got pretty red and she checked it out and said it should be okay, but if the redness continued, put peroxide on it. It's kind of swollen now, but you know, my nails look great. And it feels much better than when I went in.  They don't do handpainted designs [I know a girl asked for a flower and they showed her decals to her dismay] but I got some charming little hearts and flowers that look pretty freaking cute. My feet are immaculate, and I feel good knowing I had great service and didn't pay through the nose for it!  I'll be a regular; they also offer complete hair salon services, waxing, and eyebrow threading.

I was starving and needed a Thai fix STAT-- found Krua Thai online and oh boy! Literally a block from my house. First time I totally missed it, it's hiding in a dark strip mall catty-corner to Taste of India.   I did a circle, tried again, bingo! I parked right in front of Krua and what a sight to behold.. A warm glow, charming [possibly silk] orchids and a faux fountain trickling behind the glass door. No one was dining on a Monday night, but I was about to.  Behind the podium in the back perked up an elderly couple, super-friendly and ready to meet the challenge of serving me some mind-blowing Pad Thai.   Did I say I was starving? Shrimp Panang, Tofu Pad Thai, Veggie Rolls, and Pineapple Fried Rice. I requested take-out, and called my husband while the order was whipped up. It was a reasonably-priced meal that made my Mini Cooper smell so delectable I almost needed to pull over a half-block from home to dig in.. but that would be rude to my friend at home who was going to [attempt to] share..  The Panang was spicy but cool with coconut milk, the Pad Thai was light but loaded with the good stuff, the veggie rolls were crisp and heavenly, the Fried Rice a sweet contrast. The best thing about it all? This was the least-greasy Thai food I've ever had!   A 5-star will be doled out after experiencing the dining in Krua.

Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.  I started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..  Pineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.  The service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door.   I don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first.

I found the bane of my pregnant existence: a giant slab of fry bread loaded with beans, lettuce, cheese, grilled onion, and sour cream.. also known as the Vegetarian Taco.   The place isn't too big, and you place your order at the counter and wait for it. The food comes fast though, and when ours did, I gulped in anxiety over how to tackle the taco.. it's h u g e. Just give in, get a pile of napkins [and a moist towelette] and grab that delicious morsel with both hands and understand it's messy. It was love at first bite for me, tasting every ingredient nestled between two sides of one delicious piece of fry bread.   For dessert, my husband and I split a powdered sugar fry bread, and as he was so full from his green chili beef taco, I got most of it.   Bring your appetite and leave your Biltmore ladies behind, because hearing how fattening this wonderful place is would be a total buzzkill.

Let's get one thing straight: I am a pho snob.  I've had both vegetarian/tofu and beef. I've been out for pho more than I've been out for any other kind of food put together. I seriously ate at Pho Hoa in Olympia every single day for a straight month after I graduated high school [high-roller with all my grad money, I know you're jealous].  So I know pho. I know that it varies even within a chain in quality. I also know that Maxim has the best pho I've had since I lived in Olympia. I'm so loyal to Pho Hoa but seriously.. it's lucky Maxim isn't in the same town because I would have to sneak away to Maxim every other day.  Down the the nitty-gritty: plenty of condiments and plenty of peppers and lime so I don't have to fight over the last slices. It's clean and there's plenty of space in case a whole ton of people need pho immediately after reading this review. I had the tofu/vegetarian pho, and it was delicious! And I don't usually even like vegetarian broth. Chock full of your greens and tasty blocks of succulent tofu lightly pan-fried floating amidst tons of rice noodles. The servers are friendly and the place is cheap! I love it. I want to go back. I need more Maxim.

We drove from Phoenix for a midweek getaway with some friends in Las Vegas. We got in a little late and after a much-needed nap we decided around 11PM we were starving. After walking the strip we found the only seemingly-tasty eatery open at the New York-New York. Oh boy.  They were very open, so it wasn't like we came in like inconsiderate morons right before closing. Our section was very understaffed; one elderly man taking orders, filling waters, and serving food to literally everyone dining at that hour. He was still really friendly and it got our hopes up.  Iced tea was alright. Refills started lagging and I really understood however was bummed, because the food was all very, very... very salty. The bread was good, I always feel weird dipping bread into plain oil though, like one of those things Americans think is really upscale and authentic but it's really just something cranked out of the obese arteries that also crank out nasty 'Italian' chain restaurants like Macaroni Grill..  We each started with a house salad. $10 at Il Fornaio gets you a pile of floppy browning lettuce doused in Kraft Italian dressing. Literally. Unimpressive.   Husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and I ordered the lobster ravioli with cream sauce. Ha.. ha.. ha.. After a 45-minute wait after the salads were cleared, we were served the worst excuses for pasta. My 11-year old sister could make better pasta. I guess to Il Fornaio, 'cream sauce' means 'brown gravy flavored with fish'. I guess 'vodka sauce' is Easy Mac sauce with a sour aftertaste. My lobster was horrid. I'm not sure what it reminded me of, but it was so tough, like overcooked shrimp. It looked like overcooked shrimp too. Our entrees were so unappetizing we just gave up. Let me add that my husband has been in military training for the past year and is completely used to less-than-gourmet, and even he couldn't eat this stuff.  Disclaimer: I am not against paying top dollar for food that deserves it [the next night we had a grade-A experience at Shibuya which ran us almost double]. This food deserved maybe ten bucks, total, because it reminded me of Bertolli frozen pasta dinners. But we got stiffed for $80 [before tip] for this hot mess. I think it's pretty obvious when food is unsatisfactory, but rather than asking if something was wrong with our food [as the other restaurants demanding this amount of money do], joked he wasn't taking our plates until we ate at least half of each our dishes.  I'm going to make this easy for everyone: Il Fornaio is good if all you're used to is Olive Garden.

Ohhh do I love gelato. Who doesn't? G-spot totally gets it.  The service is okay, not rude but not A+. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.  The gelato is wonderful! Just like it should be, smooth, sweet, and decadent. I had the tiramisu, in a medium. It was a perfect serving for me [if you complain about the 'small portions', just remember it's a treat to be savored, not to fill your gut], and I love the little fact sheet hanging on the wall that tells you it's less fat than ice cream and so on.. it really pressures me to relax and not worry about blowing my diet [;  The store itself is very very clean and issues of 944 are on the little tables inside. Plenty of outdoor seating for the warmer days as well. I really like that the G-Spot is connected to Hava Java, because after gelato I was really craving an italian soda [cliche, I know].   If you haven't yet, hit the G-spot.. it's not even hard to find [:

My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place.  First impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..? Inside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way. The coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table.   The menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching.   The jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.

Oh Pita Jungle, how I love you so. I first was brought here by my mother upon my return to Phoenix for a healthy lunch. The place is very busy but adequately priced. I am a huge fan of the greek salad and if you just want a light lunch, get a small. The falafel platter is delicious, as well as the spinach four-cheese quesadilla.  I've never had a problem with the service, my water is always promptly refilled and yes, they are short, but I would be too if the place was as busy as it is during lunch.  Art adorns the walls and I'm a fan of that huge mirror [sneaky people-watching!] on the back wall.  I would recommend this place to anyone, it really is my favourite spot for lunch.

My husband and I were on our honeymoon in Vegas and wanted to try as many different spots as possible. We had passed Nine Fine Irishmen the night before so we walked over and arrived just in time for dinner. There were only 5 minutes left on happy hour so we ordered a couple pints. The server was absolutely wonderful and helpful when it came to making suggestions and even let me get another pint on the happy hour price, despite it being twenty minutes late. The shepherd's pie was incredible, the best I've ever tasted. I had the steak with macaroni and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was portioned enormously and tasted so incredible that I wanted to stop eating but really, I couldn't. The outside patio seating is nice and casual, and the inside seating is dimly lit and nicer. We will definitely be back here next time we are in Vegas!

I just experienced lunch at Roka last week. We walked in and no one else was there dining. The host/server seemed a little confused and we asked about lunch, and he somehow 'got it'.. haha.   Only the lounge area was open [I've never been during dinner, anyone want to take me?! Ha!], real nice and quiet, an oasis from the hustle-and-bustle of bright Scottsdale in the early afternoon. I had the passion fruit-mango iced tea and boy was that pretty! Pretty impressive for a typically-basic beverage.   We came in with a sushi craving [I love my little baby, always wanting the good stuff] and were disappointed to see only three different kinds and a sashimi bowl available. I honestly was thinking of gorging on 5 different rolls and that was that, but I was thrown a curve ball. We decided on the avocado maki, the avocado-yellowtail maki, and a field greens salad and miso soup.   I got over my inability to be a glutton, and I started to feel at peace with everything. No need to get pregzilla right? I did have to hit American Apparel afterward anyway, and with those slim cuts, I'd be shooting myself in the foot if I ate a huge meal when needing to check out swimsuits.. Anyway. The waiter was cute [and he smelled SO GOOD... thanks, hormones] and friendly, and was really good about refilling drinks and bringing our lunch promptly. Before we knew it, we were faced with a slew of healthy vittles and I was a happy camper. Everything was awesome, and satisfying, but not super filling. Perfect. The way Americans should eat.

I swear to God, I always find the best eats right before I move far away. BEST eats.  This place is SO clean. I could probably eat off the floor. Small joint with framed photos of the Chicago cityscape, sports [THE BEARS.], and Al Capone. Hell yeah.   We told the cheery girl at the register we were first-timers and she got a menu while apologizing for potentially smelling like onions [she had just finished lunch, haha]. So gave us a rundown of the whole menu real quickly and when my friend ordered the chicken gyro, she suggested she get the chicken shawarma gyro instead, adding it was made with a special in-house marinade. We also got the vegetarian platter [2 kinds of hummus, 3 dolmas, 2 pitas, 3 falafel] and I got a chicago gyro [beef and lamb mix] with fries.   Can we say fast? Like, that food was fast. I didn't know where to start. I dug into the hummus and swooned like [90s] Tom Cruise just asked me to prom. I melted in my seat and the floodgates broke. Crushed the most delicious falafel I've ever had: delicate, hot, wonderful with tzaziki but great on its own. Destroyed my gyro, and as the onion and tomato fell off, I hustled to put them back on top [and I don't even like onion usually]. Fries had a seasoning that reminded me of Tony Cachere's with salt [or if you're from the NW, Johnny's] seasoning. MMM. Dolmas served cold and didn't taste canned.   Heaven. CG is heaven.

I'm a pho snob, my hitlist is impressive. In Olympia, I ate pho literally every single day. Test me, wannabe purists...  Nam Sao is the best. The guy always working and seeming to make the food is so quick and super sweet. Great service, my drink never goes empty, and the table is set in traditional pho-joint style: a metal caddy with spoons, forks [...], chopsticks, napkins, and all the delicious condiments.  The menu is enormous, so if you happen to be in the mood for something other than their glorious, never-watered-down noodle soup, you can try something else. The spring rolls, I love them. The boba tea is great too, I've had it thicker and more rich at Pho Hoa in Oly but I like the less creamy variety served at Nam Sao.   Fast service, cheap filling meal, wonderful server.. I literally cannot think of anything bad to say about Nam Sao, except it's so small it's kind of hard to find if you're new to the spot. Just go to the right of Fry's and you'll see this little piece of heaven with its lights on, welcoming you in.

This Target is great. Never out of certain groceries, great prices, cool hair stuff [and always markdowns in that department]. I love that it's also clean. This Target used to be my SPOT, my main squeeze, for pregnancy cravings. Icees and pretzels with cheese, if you please.   This Target is one of the few with a nicer cheese selection and tofu in the grocery.   Did I say how CLEAN this Target is?!

PROTIP: Compliment and be interested in my weird hair and you will get cool points.   Super-friendly barista, small setting littered with ASU-West students cramming for.. something.  I'm not drinking coffee anymore so I don't jazz the little fetus in my belly, so I opted for a mint tea. The tea sachet is sewn and held in a cheesecloth kind of thing and it was really fantastic! I'll go back soon.

Nothing does pregnancy hunger well like happy hour appetizers at a barbeque joint.  We started with an order of nachos sans jalapenos. We also got everything but the cheese and shredded chicken on the side [thanks, picky friend] but it honestly gave me an opportunity to taste the toppings one by one. The guacamole, they nailed it. The 'cowboy caviar' [black beans and a mild salsa mix] was different, but refreshing. The nachos also were huge, as a proper appetizer [not something to fill you up, but satiated] can feed 3.   Next we ordered the rib bones [4 ribs in a bowl]. Not my thing, I like big meaty ribs and I knew these were just a scrawny taster, but I wasn't a fan of the marinade either. Pretty fatty, I ended up with half the meat sitting on my plate because I don't like really fatty meat in general. But that's ribs, you know?  We also had a half order of steak fries. They are served up deep fried with a sweet and spicy jam on the side. I loved these. Real greasy, real freaking good. The steak was way tender.  The unanimous favorite were the sliders. We got 3, all pork. Pour a little of the barbeque sauce sitting on the table on those bad boys and you'll surely be in heaven. Melt-in-your-mouth tender, juicy shredded pork between a toasted buttered bun. I could eat three more orders easily.  I tried the peach cobbler [which was actually a crisp], fantastic. Juicy peaches and cinnamon under a crumbly sweet topping. YES! Hit the spot.  Service was nice, and I think that goes for the whole place. We had servers from different tables stopping by to clear our empty plates often and if there was a lag in beverage refills, there was a swift apology made with the refill in hand. I saw the table next to us didn't get their nachos right, and their server was super sweet and nice about it and corrected the problem quickly. I was satisfied.  Based on my iced tea and appetizers, fantastic. I'll try a real meal there sometime before I leave, and then we can maybe talk about 5 stars.

We stumbled upon this little spot one day with my sister... We were on the hunt for some serious froyo and we were definitely satisfied by this spot! There are lots and lots of awesome flavors to choose from- the cherry swirled with horchata was on point. There were honestly so many varieties of the yogurt itself we each had a hard time choosing! The toppings bar was very neat, clean, and also stocked with lots of goodies. The service we got was very friendly. There's seating inside and outside in the front in the shade.   I like that it's right next door to Chipotle! My only wish is that Zoyo had sugar-free or fat-free yogurt selections.
