This complex, for the most part, is really great. The unites are nice (lived in two) and the grounds are well maintained. The six pools are great- we're always able to find a non-crowded one. There is easy access to the 202 and 143, it's a five minute drive to Mill Ave or Old Town, and it's within walking distance to Nu Town and Honey Bears! We've never experienced any issues. The only thing I would caution you on is moving out- it seems they always have to charge you for something after move out- regardless of how well you clean before you leave. Also, if you ever have any questions about a policy or charge the office isn't much help- they just say, "It's a Weidner (management company) thing."

Excellent food and a great value. My carne asada tacos were well prepared and I only wish I ordered more. The flavor was great, with good, well seasoned meat. Don't let the parking lot scare you away, it's worth it.

This place is now open. It's your standard dive bar, but it's got that nice classic feel inside. It's pretty relaxed, not busy, the bartenders are nice, and the drinks are cheap. A few video games, pool tables, and nice TVs. It's a decent place to throw a few back.

My order was quick and easy over the phone, the guy was really nice, and the food was very good. My S&S chicken was perfect and in a nice sized portion. I would definitely come here again; overall great service and food for the price.

Kinda expensive, but was seriously the best service I have ever had at a restaurant! All the staff was great and our waiter, Toad, was exceptional! Burger, wings, and mac & cheese were all great.

The Barbacoa street tacos are good and they seem to use fresh ingredients. The service was great, very friendly and laid-back. I only wish the hot salsa was more spicy.

Brought my car in for an oil change, got home and saw they had the engine wrong and used the wrong oil... when I brought it back they insinuated I was wrong. We finally had to pop the hood so they could see for themselves they had it wrong. They were nice and re-did it, but never admitted the error or appologized. I felt they acted like correcting their mistake was doing me a favor. I wouldn't recommend this place.
