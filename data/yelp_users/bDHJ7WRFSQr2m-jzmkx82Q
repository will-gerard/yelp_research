This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area, and I've taken several friends here to share it with, both locally and from out of town. In fact, I would like to go there today! I love the Lemongrass chicken, spicy beef salad, Seafood Pho, and the garlic green beans.    I absolutely love the food, and the only reason it doesn't have five stars is the service. It's not terrible and they've never screwed up my order or anything, but it's not the greatest I've ever had. I recall waiting a few minutes with an empty water glass before I could resume eating because I was thirsty. I'd rather wait for a refill than not eat at this restaurant though.  One thing to keep in mind, this place is small, and it gets busy, so if you don't want to wait for a table, go at an off time like during the week or for lunch. Dinner time on Friday or Saturday night fills up pretty quick!

My first visit was last night with a friend, and we experienced terrible service. I'm not a big complainer or full of difficult requests as I worked in the industry for 5 years, but this was bad.  After we were sat and given menus, we were basically deserted. We had already picked what we wanted to order for dinner yet hadn't even been brought waters yet. We had to walk to the bar to ask if anyone was going to come serve us at the table.  Finally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal.   I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+. If I'd had more time I would have asked to speak to a manager.

My boyfriend and I went here for the first time this week, even though it's right down the street from my house! I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the sake selection. We had an assortment of food, a couple appetizers, an entree, and some sashimi. I wouldn't rave about it being 5 star, but it was definitely good! The menu isn't huge but it's enough that we would like to go back. We already signed up for their next sake sampling...hopefully our next visits will be as enjoyable and it will be a new go-to neighborhood spot.

This is not one of those bad reviews because of one silly little thing that no one should be judging a restaurant so harshly on. I can honestly say it was the worst Chinese food I can ever remember having.  I tried this for lunch this week, and I thought I might have just ordered a bad dish, but my coworker got something different and did not even eat his, it was so awful.  I ordered the General Chicken, and all I could eat out of it was the (very few) vegetables. The chicken was some sort of combination of soggy and chewy, which I'm not even sure how they accomplished. Maybe it was sitting in the (flavorless) sauce for a couple days after they cooked it and they just reheated it? That's my best guess. The outside was soggy and gross and the inside was tough and chewy, I could barely even bite through it.  The fried rice appeared to be regular white rice that may have been rolled around in some grease for a moment. It had no flavor and nothing else added into it. I'll skip over the egg roll because those are never much to talk about. The crab puff was the most edible part of the whole meal, and I don't even care for crab puffs.   I usually like to give places a second chance. I will not be trying this EVER again. As a side note, they also forgot something we asked for (we got delivery) but I try not to judge on mistakes if the food is good...there was nothing good here.

I haven't tried enough things on the menu nor was I thrilled enough to give this five stars, but it was good. I would like to go back to try their famous salad! The Mac and Cheese was pretty good, the hummus plate was good, my friend's salad (can't remember the name, but it was the one with popcorn in it) was alright. I am also planning on trying the scallops and the BLT sandwich next time.   The fact that they had a Moscow Mule on their cocktail menu was an added bonus. I didn't try it yet because I wanted to take advantage of happy hour and ordered wine instead, but I will be!

I went to this salon recently for the first time, not expecting to be impressed. I've been to many of the type I assumed this would be, but agreed to go with my coworker since it was convenient to our office. I'm glad I did! We called in the morning and scheduled two manicures (mine was gel) for the evening after work, so we were able to get in same day.  When we arrived we didn't have to wait at all, and they actually seated us next to each other at the same time, so we really did get to have our nails done "together" (unlike a lot of other places) which was nice. Debbie did my gel manicure and she did a nice job, actually avoided any mishaps like making my finger bleed or filing my skin instead of the nail (yes, this stuff has happened to me on more than one occasion).   I had gotten used to going to a more "upscale" salon with a specific nail tech previously, which I quit going to due to the expense and the fact that she was always booked up. Now I know that I can get my nails done for a reasonable price and not have to schedule weeks out. I also appreciated that there was no language barrier so I was able to communicate what I wanted with no issues. They had quite the large gel color selection too. I can't compare creativity or unique requests since I didn't ask for anything special, but I wouldn't doubt their ability or be afraid to find out.  I would definitely go back here next time.

I am so glad I found this place! Ready made meals that are healthy, fresh, and don't taste bad! Where has this concept been all my life? I have probably cut my average daily caloric intake in half (at least) by getting my food here and I don't feel hungry. When I first looked at their website, I saw that the food came in different portions and assumed that the "small" was going to be like three bites and that's why it was so low calorie. Wrong! I honestly can eat three of these a day with maybe a snack and not feel hungry.  Between working full time and my other regular activities (plus being single and only having myself to feed) cooking just doesn't really fit into my schedule. I tend to eat out way too often, and I was feeling really unhealthy and gaining weight. I have tried some pre-packaged meal plans before and they were awful, they didn't even taste like food.   It isn't cheap, but if your previous lifestyle was like mine, neither was that. If you compare the prices to a family buying in bulk or a student living off ramen and spaghetti, then yes, it's ridiculously expensive. If you compare it to going out to dinner several times a week and grabbing lunch out someplace regularly, it's the same price or cheaper.   I'm still in the process of trying things and figuring out what I like and what I don't, but so far I have found a fair amount of things that taste good. I add hot sauce to a lot of things or a little salt and pepper, but really, they do a pretty good job.

My first impression of this place was good, because it's big and decently organized for a resale shop. At a glance I saw some nice items too, on the end caps, so I had high hopes. However, when I took a closer look through the rows of clothes I was disappointed to see the same old garbage that places like Plato's Closet is full of (think Charlotte Russe). Sad. :(   I decided to take some stuff in to sell, and I brought a wide variety since that's what the store seemed to have. I've seen review after review of these types of shops where people complain about how little they got paid or whatnot, and I can promise you I'm giving a fair report back and not just complaining that I didn't get paid big bucks for worthless clothes.  I brought unworn stuff (some even still had tags) from Guess, Coach, Bebe, True Religion, Paige jeans, BCBG, Express, Forever 21, etc. The buyer somehow managed to go through it in in like two seconds, so I didn't have high hopes that they would buy much...it would have been physically impossible for her to have even seen half of it. They offered to buy ONE thing. I didn't take the offer and took my stuff to a different store. At the next store I tried, I sold all the jeans, a dress, and two pairs of shoes. Much more worthwhile! Safe to say I will never bother taking anything to sell to Upscale Cheapskate again!
