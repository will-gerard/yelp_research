Everyone here was polite and greeted us.  I originally gave a 1 star but updated to 4 because they redeemed themselves today.

The store had a great variety of rockers and curios to choose from.  The staff was super friendly.  The pricing was low and competitive.  Very clean and organized environment.  Will recommend to friends and family!

We have Chas Roberts for our AC and it's a brand new unit installed a new home build. The AC went out a few days ago and we called it in for warranty work.  They were supposed to be here Monday and never heard anything so we called late Monday to see check in the status.  A rude customer service agent answer the phone.  I asked if he was having a bad day and replies back with even a nastier attitude.  I couldn't believe how bad the service was over the phone.  While the agent puts me on hold the recording says "calling Chas Roberts will be the most comfortable call."  Not even close. The agents sound like they are cranky and are in a hurry to get you off the phone.  I called again on Tuesday and found out that there was no order out in!  Basically we have been waiting around for nothing.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and they said no one is available.   I can't believe this place is even in business with how they bad they treat their customers.  Horrible customer service and I'm still waiting for them to come and fix out AC in this crazy hot summer!  Supposedly they are supposed to come out tonight anywhere from 4:30pm to 10pm.  Stay away from Chas Roberts!!!

The staff is super friendly here and everyone says hi and asks if you need help.  I've been to many firearm stores and I have to say most places I have visited do not have good service or friendly staff.  Most of the time you are trying to chase someone down to help you.  At Healy, I was greeted almost immediately after I walked in by not one but several members of the staff.  Even the owner was behind the counter greeted me and asked if how was doing even though he knew I already made a purchase.  I highly recommend this place for all your firearm needs.

Just ordered take out and I have to say the price is low and portions are generous and best of al, the food tastes awesome!  I have tried many Thai restaurants and my favorite is Tom Yum and Red or Green Curry.  It's rare I find places that get the Tom Yum right and some places the vegetables in the curry doesn't taste fresh.  I have to say I love the Tom Yum here!  Truly amazing!  Perfect amount of sour and spices.  The curry I ordered this time was, can't spell or pronounce the name but it had peanut sauce in it too and boy was it yummy.   I highly recommend this place.  I give this place my two thumbs up!

Excellent job. Just got my TV mounted today and they did a very professional clean job.  This is my second time having my TV mounted and last time was from a different installer and Justin and his crew did a far more superior job and even cleaned everything up afterwards including finger prints and smudges they left on the TV and furniture. I highly recommend!  Thank you

Love this place.  Feels like a home and not an apartment.  I love to listen and watch my movies fairly loud and even sing karaoke with my fianc√© and friends.  My previous apartment did not allow for us to do that.  Now living in a home with no attached walls and no one living above us gives us the ultimate privacy.  We have had several get togethers and watched movies and listen to music at loud volumes and no complaints.  I don't hear my neighbors and they don't hear us.  No more listening to my neighbor's footsteps above us.  The backyard feature is awesome too.  Can BBQ in the privacy of your own backyard etc.  The management is super friendly and they really make you feel welcome.  We live in the three bedroom and it really feels roomy.  We looked at other luxury apartments like Chandler Camden but you have to pay a lot more money for less square footage and only two bedrooms.  It was a no brainer to get more actual livable square footage and an extra room for three hundreds less per month.  If you want the ultimate privacy, feel of living in your own home, and friendly management staff, then this is the place for you.  I highly recommend this place.
