The reviews on Yelp led me to call Arizona Chimney &Air Ducts and I can say the reviews are spot on! I called initially at 7pm and Becky promptly returned my call.  They're booking up pretty quickly but she worked with me and my schedule.  Sean showed up and from the moment he arrived, he was professional, clean and meticulous. He cleaned the flue and my dryer vent both, and even showed the aftermath. I highly recommend this company--very impressed with their professionalism!

I went to The Comedy Spot on February 27th.  Now, I've been to The Comedy Spot before and I absolutely LOVE IT but, I was a bit disappointed by a few things. I tried to call before buying my ticket but there isn't a live person to talk to, just a recording. Upon arriving, I'm told the debit machine to pay for entry is broke. No problem, I can walk to the ATM, God knows I need the exercise! The staff at the door were very apologetic and nice, it was when I walked inside that I noticed a lot of the raw charm was gone. What used to be a brick wall that served as the comedians' backdrop, was now a black wall. Actually, ALL the walls are black now. It just feels dark and dungeon-like instead of what most comedy clubs remind me of; a vibrant back alley where the cool kids hang. The lineup that night was a mix of talented comedians, contrasted with a few amateurs. My hat is tipped to all, no way I would have the guts to get up there! All in all, it was a great night. I will return, I just hope the club receives a much needed makeover soon! Support your local comedians!

Ok, I have dined here for many, many years (under new ownership) and the thing that keeps me coming back every time are the chips and salsa.  Hot, and fresh chips with just the right amount of saltiness, with salsa that includes a multitude of ingredients, I can honestly say this is the best salsa I've had at any restaurant, period.  As much as I frequent Mexican restaurants, or visit Mexico for that matter, that says a lot for Rancho.  I will drive out of my way just to have a basket of warm tortilla chips placed in front of me with fragrant, almost spicy, salsa to accompany it.  But this is just the precursor to the meal.  The "Chili Relleno" is phenomenal, light and fluffy with a smattering of cotija cheese on top--an excellent dish Rancho has continued and mastered. The guacamole is seasoned perfectly with chunks of tomato and avocado and is gourmet and creamy. On to the main dishes, and to many patrons delight, the Carne Asada and the Fajitas Ardientes are decidedly authentic.  We'll start with the Carne Asada, generous portions of beautiful Angus Beef that slice easily with a fork.  Tender, and a secret recipe guarded well by the Chef, the Carne Asada receives the most compliments and rave reviews from everyone.  The show-stopper is Fajitas Ardientes--flames shooting high from tequila and a marinade of adobo sauce, and varied spices always turn the heads of restaurant patrons.  And who doesn't love tequila?!!   Now, for the best part.  Sunday is a very generous CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH!!  Inexpensive, a HUGE assortment of hot and cold stations such as an omelet bar, taco bar, menudo, fruit stations, waffle stations, desserts, and agua fresco.  Did I mention Champagne??  If you're lucky, mariachis will serenade you, but only if you want them to.  Otherwise, they're unobtrusive. Visit Rancho Papa Chulo's and try any of their amazing dishes.  Seriously good food and friendly staff!

I only recently learned of Ichulas Nails and Salon from a friend.  I went today and had gels done-- true gels-- by Vickie. Let me say first, a lot of technicians bill acrylic nails as gel, hoping the consumer doesn't know the difference. Vickie was kind enough to educate me on the difference! She also does amazing design work! The girls were all fun, professional and energetic and made me feel right at home. Go see Vickie and let her create something just for you, or keep it traditional (my preference).
