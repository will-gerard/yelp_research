I do a lot of home printing for work and this place has saved me a lot of money.  They are very helpful, not just with my toner, but also recommending a printer that would be more cost-effective given the large volume I print.  I had an issue with my current printer and they told me to bring it in and did some work on it at no charge...that's pretty amazing customer service.  I won't go anywhere else for my ink and toner.

The pizza is good.  The pizookie dessert is delicious.  But, I give big dings for the long wait for food (usually after sustaining a pretty long wait just to get a table) and the fact that they refuse to take reservations for large parties making it an absolute nightmare of a wait for a large group to eat there.  For that reason alone, I can't go back.

Ate here as a kid when it was at Park Central Mall.  The sandwiches are just as good at this Collonade location.  I like the beef brisket and the fries are always yummy.  It's just good, warm, comfort food...a nice deli sandwich.  The guys behind the counter are always friendly and parking and seating is almost always available.  What's not to like?

It's such a bright, whimsical place, it's fun just to wander around and "discover" treasures in the store.  I LOVE my MacKenzie Childs purchase and was very pleased with the service...attentive, but not hovering...helpful and friendly.  All in all, a great experience.

LOVE their decorated sugar cookies.  They are always colorful and festive for the appropriate season or holiday.  Most importantly, they are yummy!

Great food.  Great service. Loved the mohitos...just like in Cuba.  And the Ropa Vieja is excellent.

It's much cleaner than other washes and they keep it up pretty good...I've only once been there and found a machine was broken.  It's pretty cheap.  I put my convertible in the self-service area (ok, actually, I get my husband to do the washing) but we run our other car through the automatic and it does a great job.  The kids love going through and getting sprayed with all the colors, it does a good job, and I don't have to get out and worry about them when they are with me.  Definitely one of the better self-service car washes around.

Went in yesterday with the kids (they like going thru car washes) and the machine took my money. Unfortunately, I had put in a large bill.  I couldn't find someone there to help but saw a number on the door.  I called and low and behold, someone actually answered on a weekend.  I geared up for a battle but was pleasantly surprised when the manager told me he'd have someone there in a little bit and I could stop by any time the rest of the day and get my money back and a free wash for the trouble.  Finally a business that treats the customer right!

Stetson Salad.  If you have never had it, just get it and do it now.  Wow!  Also, love the tuna when they have it on the menu.  It is always cooked to perfection and I am always disappointed when I order tuna elsewhere as it pales in comparison.  I like the decor, it's quirky and whimsical.  Also love the Ciao shots with the lime on top.  Delicious.

T-shirts: I've had them design and print shirts for me.  Their artist was great. He really came up with a fantastic design and the shirts have held up really well after multiple washes.    Embroidery: We already had our logo for embroidery, so they just had to get it onto the hats and clothing.  We sometimes change the colors of parts of our logo (depending on what color the shirt is) and they always keep it all straight.  They helped us make the embroidery the right size so it would look good on the polos (we were going to go too small and after seeing it all done, they were totally right....they look perfect.)  We are very happy with all the orders we've had done here.

Can't speak to the ambiance as I got my food to go, but my Chinese chicken salad was fantastic.  I was working late and picked up the food.  Went back to work and the salad even sat out for an hour before I got to it, but it didn't matter.  It was amazing.  I'll be back for more!

Can't comment on the chemicals used or not used on my clothes.  I  don't understand all that.  But, as far as service goes, I'm very happy here.  They are very friendly and attentive.  My clothes are always ready when promised and they turn out great.

Food is just average and a bit over priced.  Not up to the Fox standards I have come to expect.

Took computer in for a repair, but Santos spent two minutes with it and said I didn't need to fix it...he just had to make some quick adjustment.  Then wouldn't take $ for it since he said it was so easy.  It may have been quick and easy for him, but it meant the world for me as my dad uses his computer for everything.  He could have totally charged me and I'd still be happy because my dad's computer was working properly.  What a super nice guy.  I'll totally be back.

Loved the sandwich...kind of like a round, sealed pannini with great stuff inside.  I would never have put the apples and turkey together but the guy at the counter recommended it and it was really good.  Totally different than anything I've ever had.  My order came up fast. (I hate it when I only get 45 minutes for lunch and I waste most of it just waiting for my food to be ready.)  I also had a cake with coconut on it that was delicious, moist and a good portion.  I'll be back soon.

Still a huge fan.  Love the new location in Uptown Plaza, the new menu additions, logo and vibe.  If you have yet to experience Zookz, drop your boring sub sandwich in the trash and try these unique, fresh, toasted sandwiches.  I am hooked for life!

Would have given it 5 stars but one of the women tellers is a bit of a hassle and doesn't follow through.  But everyone else is really great.  You get personalized service like you're some big wig with tons of money even if you aren't.  The can do everything a big bank can, except they have more limited hours/locations.  They close at 4 which stinks, but I've shown up at 4:05 and they actually let me in and helped me.  I can guarantee you no big bank would do that!  So, the limitations are far outweighed by the great customer service I get from almost everyone there.

Wow!  Worst customer service ever!  Came in to make a deposit.  Had two little kids with me.  My phone had just died and I asked to plug it in to get the account number that I had stored on the phone.  "We don't have any outlets" was the reply.  Seriously?  I said I only need it for two minutes to get the account number off my phone.  "Sorry they are all in use."  At my work, we try to please customers and make them happy in every possible way. If it's 5 minutes to 8 and we open at 8 but we see someone at the door, we open it...cheerfully.  If someone brings a dog, we offer to let them fill a water bowl outside.  If someone were to ask to plug in a phone that died, we'd say no problem.  I mean come on...two minutes plugged in??!!  With so much competition out there, we strive to provide the best customer service.  Needless to say, we have since closed our account and moved to a credit union and are very happy.  Oh, and bonus, the credit union said I can use their power any time.  :-)
