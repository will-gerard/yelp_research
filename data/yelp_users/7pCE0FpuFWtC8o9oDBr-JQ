My family frequently visits this place for their jalapeno cheddar bagels and jalapeno cream cheese. The bagels are very tasty and the cream cheese is even tastier. The prices are very affordable and the service has always been exceptional. During my most recent visit, I had a single cheddar bagel with jalapeno spread and my fiance had the breakfast bagel. My only complaint about mine was that the bagel wasn't very toasted, but they were very generous with the spread. My fiance's bagel had a very thick layer of bacon on it (which he really liked), and his seemed like a very good deal considering all of the meat he was given! The glaciers and the chai lattes are reasonably priced in comparison to the high price these are at the more popular coffee chains. Overall, this is definitely a great stop to grab some breakfast or brunch in Ahwatukee.

I don't know what has happened to this formerly tasty and satisfying restaurant, but things definitely seem to have fallen way below par in terms of taste, quality, and price. I ordered the cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and beans combination plate and was very disappointed to see that the beans were microwaved while the rest of the food lacked flavor. The staff is usually always nice at this location, but the food just isn't worth it anymore. Maybe it's different at different locations, but the only tasty food still left here are the chips and salsa.

This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican places to visit when I'm back home from school. I usually get a marinated pork burrito with red sauce on top, and it is absolutely delicious. It's spicy and tastes extremely authentic considering that this restaurant is located in Ahwatukee. It's a nice little hole-in-the-wall place that is especially great for pick-up orders.

One thing that I really like about chain restaurants is that they're generally safe bets and you can come in knowing what to expect in terms of food, service, and cleanliness. As soon as we walked in we were seated at a table that had a few crumbs left behind and was a bit sticky. The server asked us what he could get us before we even had a chance to really sit down, and when we received our drinks the straws were already in the drinks - this is a huge pet peeve of mine since I generally like my straw wrapped and I don't have to worry about cross-contamination between server and patron. Okay, whatever.  We ordered the fried zucchini that cost $2 during Happy Hour which was a nice little deal, but I didn't care for them since they tasted mostly like a slice of zucchini that wasn't even cooked long enough with a sad excuse of breading over it. The burgers were tasty and predictable of what you could expect from this chain, and cost about $10 each.   Overall, skip this location and head to the Chandler location if you can. This spot definitely draws in a certain (Wally Word/hick) crowd, and it can definitely feel a tad uncomfortable if you're not used to it. The McDonalds in the Wal Mart across the street must have had a short line tonight.

I spent less than $100 total by booking a room for Saturday and Sunday night. It wasn't until after I paid the fee did I notice all of the negative reviews on here and other sites. I was, however, very pleasantly surprised with my positive experience. I was initially a bit put off by the hotel clerks at check-in for their lack of politeness, but after seeing our room (which was VERY clean - we checked for bed bugs, stains, etc.), I was happy that I decided to stay here. The monorail was also very convenient (although pricy at $5 one-way) and I felt as though the location of the hotel was far enough from the main strip to feel like I was getting away from the noise. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for the quality and price.

My family and I frequently visit this sandwich shop whenever we're near the area. The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well.   Be sure to bring cash, this place doesn't take credit cards.

I went here for brunch on a Sunday and waited for a little over an hour to be seated. The view is stunning and the waiter was very attentive with re-filling drinks and clearing plates. The selection at this buffet was amazing - everything ranging from prime rib, sushi, pizza, seafood, and a spectacular array of desserts. For ~$70/couple, I wold say that the food and service was definitely worth it.

I heard so many good things about this buffet and how delicious the food was, but my recent trip had very little to be desired. My boyfriend and I got in before the dinner rush so we were seated as soon as we arrived, but it took ten minutes for our server to come and take our drink orders. Our drinks were empty the majority of the time, and our plates were stacked on our little table. The food was the most disappointing thing of all - the prime rib was dry and flavorless and there was a very small selection of foods in general. I was hoping for more from the buffet, and I am sad to say that I will never return again.

I always visit this place every time I'm back home from school. The food is very tasty and the restaurant is clean. I usually order shredded beef tacos or the shredded beef chimichanga, and I am usually always very pleased. The only slight con about this place is that their prices are quite a bit higher than more Mexican restaurants that are a bit more authentic.

The psycho drivers in the parking lot are what keep me from even wanting to come to this location. Seriously, if a pedestrian is crossing the damn street don't come racing down like a moron because you want to race to a stop sign. The staff have always been decent, though the workers in the optical department have always obnoxiously loud amongst themselves and unprofessional in general.

I went to this restaurant on my way through Anthem and was pleasantly happy with my experience. The restaurant was empty and I was able to sit wherever I wanted. I ordered a pizza with four toppings on it and was disappointed to see that $1.40 was charged for each topping (doh, my mistake). The pizza was tasty, however, and we filled up for less than $20. It was a nice lunch, and I would probably come here again in the future.

This is my first stop for alcohol in Vegas. The drinks are strong and very tasty (you can hardly even taste the alcohol), and for light-weights like me, you become pretty tipsy after only a few drinks. The 44 Magnum is my favorite (it's the sweetest and strongest in my opinion), but you're allowed up to two samples so you can taste before you buy!   Even though the drinks are a bit on the pricier side, the experience itself (and the fun cups) are totally worth it. Just be sure to keep your cup so that you can receive your next re-fill with a $4 discount. The half-yard and yard sizes are definitely a fun deal.

My family and I came across this restaurant by accident. We came in with positive attitudes and hoped for a satisfying experience. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for what we encountered. It took about forty five minutes for us to receive our food in this empty restaurant, but I hoped the food would be worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken was smothered in sauce - being hardly edible. The grilled lemon chicken that two other family members ordered needed to be returned due to it being cold. The grilled pork was satisyingly warm in temperature, but nothing special. The server never officially took our drink order, and never came back to refill our water. This was definitely not a very pleasant experience.

If you're frantically looking for a restaurant for an anniversary or a hot date, then this is the perfect place to take your significant other. The Dhaba is a classy, affordable, and romantic venue. This is definitely one of the top Indian restaurants in Tempe and is about as good as it gets anywhere.   The service is fantastic, when we arrived the host greeted us and seated us at a table while setting down a few roses. I felt extremely welcomed by the restaurant host anywhere, and from the get-go I knew that this was going to be a great experience.  As for the food, it was delicious. I had the chicken tika masala (I tend to order the plainest items at ethnic restaurants) and it was cooked to perfection. The waitress was very attentive and made sure that we were completely satisfied with our order.   Just make sure to make reservations, as this place is quick to fill up at dinner.

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas.

This In-N-Out Burger is located conveniently off of the HWY17 and the Carefree Highway (223A) and is hidden in the large plaza to the left after directly turning right when getting off the highway.   This location is a lot like the other In-N-Out Burger locations in terms of friendly service, clean tables, and nicely air-conditioned. The woman at the register was very attentive and friendly, the food tasted especially fresh at this establishment, and the food was out within about 5 minutes of ordering it.

Dr. Timothy Baker: 5 stars Clinic staff/nurses: 1 star  Dr. Tim Baker has been my family physician for a few years now, and has always been very kind, informative, and respectful. I greatly appreciate the fact that he treats me like an intelligent individual, and goes over biochemical mechanisms and other medical-related subjects when discussing given conditions that I'm concerned with.   As for the rest of the medical staff, everyone is usually rude and impersonal. I've never had luck with the nurses at this location, but the fact that Dr. Baker is such a great physician has had me coming back and staying loyal to this practice.

I came here a couple of weeks ago and was very surprised at how great everything was - from the service to the food to the diverse menu. To begin, we were given pickles as a bit of an appetizer for free. The manager came to our table a couple of times to check on us, and she was very sweet and informative. She suggested that we try an Arnold Palmer with pink lemonade and iced tea which was absolutely delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and my mom ordered a chicken ranch sandwich - both of which were were very tasty. Right before we left, we stopped by the inside bakery and ordered some cookies which were also very delicious and affordable. The overall experience at this location was amazing, you can definitely tell that customer service is definitely at its prime here.

On the three occasions that I've visited this location, the workers always looked very unhappy and definitely didn't appear to want to be here. I don't usually like basing my rating on staff alone, but the staff just really puts me off and ruins the whole experience for me. Aside from them, there is a great variety of flavors and toppings. The place is decently clean, and there is plenty of seating. Overall, it's a good place for yogurt - though you should really get it to go.

Went here on a Friday night with my fiance on 4/12 for drinks at around 5:30 PM and noticed upon entering that the pub was empty. We were seated by the hostess at a table where the sun blinded us, so we decided to move to a table right behind where we were placed. After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip.

I came here on Mother's Day with my mother and sister for the weekend lunch buffet and was rather disappointed with the service and the limited choices of food. We were seated by a young lady who seemed rather bored to be there and were bluntly told about the buffet. The buffet itself was okay, though nothing very special. The butter chicken was probably my favorite (probably because it was so similar to chicken tika masala and it's rather hard to mess that up). The dessert was tasty, and included gulab jamen, rice pudding, and mango pudding. I was surprised that they didn't serve chicken tika masala or chutney. For three people ordering the lunch buffet with two iced teas and a water, the bill ended up being around $40. For this amount, I feel as though we could have gone somewhere else where the service was actually decent and the food was tastier. I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately this was either not a good day or I just had too high of expectations.
