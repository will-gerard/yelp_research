Been here twice with my dad who is apparently a VIP.  He travels to Phoenix frequently and always comes here for dinner. The staff is exceptional and welcoming. The food is great, may i say...fancy. Some pasta sauces can be a bit on the salty side but not so bad that it doesn't taste good. Desserts are a must so save room!  Also don't forget to get a shot at the end of the meal.   Make sure you have reservations because this place is small and people love it. It's always packed. They use open table for reservations as well!

I love the Ice Den.  Their ice is the best kept in the area.  The staff is always friendly and great.  They know how to run programs for both children and adults.   They have a great snack bar with outstanding coffee.  Also the restaurant is pretty good inside.   The staff in the hockey store is helpful and you can ask for clearance merchandise that they don't have on the shelf but keep in the back if you are on a budget or need to replace something quickly.   3 of 4 members in my household are actively in the programs at the Ice Den, and we all prefer this rink.

Just moved out after 8 months. Broke the lease which cost $2000 which was fine. The kick was, a couple weeks later they tried to charge over $4000. They had us pay for carpets and pay all the discounts back and then some. Living with loud kids always stomping around above us and having to park on the other side of the complex was enough to leave and invest in my own home. Settled payment with under $3500 but really? That was way more than the $2500 we expected to pay.   Note: Sure Deposit is a joke. It doesn't cover anything but they are sure to take your deposit. Plus pet rent is just wasted money because they will still charge for carpets when you leave.   Staff was friendly, but I don't extend that comment to corporate Mark-Taylor.   I don't recommend this apartment.

Always love coming here!  The staff has been great, and the food is pretty good. We don't normally have to wait long to be seated, and we enjoy the environment.  The fish and chips were definitely worth the Weight Watchers points and heartburn.  Yes... it was worth it.  I don't normally eat like that but I don't eat out a lot, so when I do, I endulge!

I had the wildflower salad with chicken and it was so good. The atmosphere was good, we went at dinner so we didn't experience the lines like it sounds like they get at lunch. The staff was friendly and it wasn't too expensive for 4 people for a decent dinner. It saved us from a fatening fast food place. I'll definitely be back.  When I'm off my diet I'll get the penne pasta which was what my boyfriend had. I tried the sauce and it was delish.

Thank you so much for your awesome service. I love using local businesses! Apples to apples, hands down your service costs much less than the VP people. I even saved more with a yelp deal. Jessica was friendly and informative. Products arrived when stated and packaged safely. I recommend beast Printing to everyone. :)

I've been to upper crust twice. I love the pizza. They have a very thin but tasty crust. The pizza sauce is so flavorful and robust I love it. For a large 8 slice pizza it's a price you can't beat and way better than delivery from a big name place. If you like tirimasu give theirs a try for dessert. You get a huge slice that you can easily share with your date and it's delish!  The staff is kind and helpful. If you have small kids they will bring you some raw dough so they can shape and cook up with dinner.

It was quite a wait for a deep dish pizza, but from what i heard it was really good.  I ordered a meatball sandwich and it was so good, but the portion sizes were too big which didn't allow us room for dessert- apparently what they are known for.  Next time we will split an entree and dessert!

Seth and his staff of trainers are the best of the best! TPT trainers are not like trainers at a "membership gym".  You will get very personalized service and they will watch to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly so you don't injure yourself. You will be provided a meal plan to help you reach your goal in an achievable time with the results YOU want.   TPT has members of all different ages and sizes so you don't have to feel worried if you are a newbie like me. The staff and trainers are friendly, and encouraging and will get you motivated to work out to your full potential and achieve even more than you thought you could compared to working out alone.   TPT is much more affordable than I thought. If you are serious about getting healthy and getting results you should come see Seth. Not only will you do the right exercises to get results quick, but you will be educated as to why his formula of food and training REALLY WORK!!   I am on my second week with TPT snd i just want to say thank you TPT for getting me motivated and healthy. I love this new journey we have started!!

Not my first time here but I like it so I went tonight when I needed a salad. I got the new strawberry harvest chicken salad because it was a nice balance of carbs and protien. I swapped out the cheese for quinoa for an additional .69 which was fine by me. I took my food to go and sat outside with my family. I was so hungry that by the time I got halfway thru I realized there was no chicken!! I finished off my dinner a little upset wondering how do I bring it up?? Do I tweet it out, yelp it? Well since I was still there I decided to go back in the store and let them know they forgot the chicken. They first said I can get you the chicken,  but I told him I ate it all. I was hungry. So he just kinda shrugged his shoulder and said sorry.   I came home and grabbed a bite of a protien bar in hopes to get some protein I needed but I'm still annoyed that I paid over $8 for a chicken salad that had no chicken!  Ugh, wish they could have somehow compensated me when I walked in and confronted. or is it my fault that I ate half of the salad without realizing and then finished off the salad knowing it was missing. Idk... I was seriously starving and didn't want to go back in after I sat down outside.

Care was fine, but just as another person said, they have issues with billing.  They market themselves as Urgent Care, however they billed my insurance as Emergency Room.  I ended up in collections for almost $200 and I NEVER received an invoice at all from Phoenix Children's Hospital.  Almost 1 year later, and now i'm trying to tell my insurance it was not an ER, and it should have been billed at standard Co-Pay like all my other Urgent Care visits.    I'm sure I'll get screwed and not be able to make any changes now that it's in collections and now that it's a new plan year.  So lesson learned.  I'll go to another Urgent Care which is not associated with Phx Children's Hospital.

I had the low carb salad with chicken.  The serving of the small chicken was 6oz which was great.  The dressing tasted fantastic, but there wasn't much of salad in a half order.  The cashier made me think it would have been bigger.  I ended up taking a slice of my bf's buffalo chicken pizza. OMG it was really good - and i'm not saying that just because i'm carb depleted.  The toppings were very good and had a nice sweet tangy zip.  My kids enjoyed cheese pizza and pasta, but i was confused that the kids size pizza was the same size as my boyfriends full size pizza.  I don't get that.  In the end, i really enjoyed dining here.  It would be great to see one of these restaurants open in the N. Phoenix, AZ area where I live!

Stopped in for the first time yesterday.  Cute store, lovely cakes on display.  The man working behind the counter makes the cakes and does a great job.    Ordered my family 2 muffins and 2 cupcakes.  I ate the red velvet cupcake which was pretty good.  I would have loved it more with a cream cheese frosting.    Cute store, love checking out small businesses!

The staff here are all friendly. One of the ladies had me bring in the brand I was feeding my dog and she reviewed the ingredients. She helped me find a brand that wasn't only comparable but better! Her knowledge was way better than the average big brand pet store employee. Love this place! Selection is great and staff really care.

We recently went in to purchase our 10th bag of dog food, the big one worth $45, and expected to get the 11th free. When we got to the register they had got rid of their tracking system and had no records of our previous purchases. ... ugh so frustrated after being so loyal and looking for a dog food break, now what????

The positive reviews are right. I walked in on a Wednesday afternoon without a problem. I sat down and was offered water. There were about 3 other clients in there getting their nails done so they were staffed appropriately for mid-week, mid-day.   I had my nails done with a gel manicure which I had never had before. The color is awesome, they stay shiny and no chips or anything. My nails feel strong and I'm not tempted to bite them. I've had them on for about a week and a half now and they still look great. I should get at least 2 weeks from them but I think they will stretch to 3 weeks.   I look forward to going back and trying new colors. Five star nails gets 5 stars *****

Cute little gem in Scottsdale. It gets really packed but that's because this place is awesome. It's got a neat decor very upbeat. The waitress said they are going to put in a new ceiling to address the noise issue because it is pretty loud when it's busy. They have a cute patio area that wasn't open yet but I can already tell will be a hit. Food portions are huge so you can probably split a meal or take leftovers.
