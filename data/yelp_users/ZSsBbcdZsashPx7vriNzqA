I was told about this place from a co-worker. Thanks buddy. My new favorite.  I have 99% good things to say about this place, and only one bad. . . . . Should I save the bad for last?  Okay, bad for last.  I walked up to the place and smelled raspberries that delighted me. Then I walked in and strong coffee hit me like flirting gone bad. It was still a good smell though.  I let the barista know I was looking for something good, and then found something awesome. I told her I wanted the Rush coffee, and pointed at the sign.  She said "Oh sorry, that is just the description of all of our coffees". My mistake, but if that was one coffee, it would be wonderful. So I looked at the actual drink menu, and chose a black and white iced late with coconut. To my surprise, I didn't receive any weird looks like I get at Starbucks for being adventurous. Then I watched the red headed barista dance around (literally) while she made my coffee. It was a pleasant experience. I think people would be happier if they got to watch people serving their food/drinks/coffee/bag groceries/etc while dancing.  So my drink tasted awesome, and she explained the stamp card to me.  As I walked out, I walked right into a cloud of cigarette smoke. There you have it, the only bad thing about this place I found. I absolutely hate smelling cigarettes! The whole patio turned into a smokers haven, it was nasty.   So all in all, the coffee is awesome and I will go back for sure. When I bring my daughters with me, I will most likely run on my way out.

Awesome burritos, made any way you want. After reading some of the reviews, I will add some stuff on here.   They now have an ATM.  Still cash only.  Still awesome taste.  You can have the food made however you want, but you have to ask several times for it.  Overall the food is great.   Thanks to my co-worker for recommending this place.   -----------UPDATE-----------  Sooooo, burrito express got me into trouble at work.  My time at work several hours after eating went a bit like this....  My co-workers walk into the room, and stop suddenly staring at me. I say "Burrito Express" Together they all say "Oh. . . . . . . OHHHHHH MAN!!!!! Come on!!!!!!!" Next thing I know, I am being told people's orders and being sent on a coffee run to get away from everyone.  Let's just say that this place does not agree with my body. I could barely stand to be in the car with myself.  I know that might be more info than you want to read, but be careful with this place.  Burrito Express is now my Only eat when not working, and wife is at work place.

How can there be no reviews for this location? Every time I eat here (1-2 times a week working grave shift), the food is always fresh. The employees are very nice in the drive through, and say more than just the usual "Hi how are you". I have not once received bad food or bad service from this location. Tonight, I went through the drive through and the employee was talking to me about funny customers, and to not worry about ordering late, or even right before they close due to the grill taking so long to cool down before they can clean it. How cool is that? Someone that actually takes care of customers. I know they do not get paid a lot working there, but wow they sure act like they love their job. The girl who handed me my food let me know that she made sure to put napkins in the bag, along with a spork. Not only did she make sure it was in there, but she called it by the right name as well. I would give her 5 starts alone just for that awesomeness.  Some Taco Bell locations can be hit or miss due to the quality of their food, but this location is great. Don't pass up this one.

I love Christina's review, but wanted to add that the bank is inside of a grocery store. Wish it would say that on the search.

Let me start by saying that I have been reading almost every review on here about this place, and have been chomping at the bit to try it.   Arrived there with my wife, and two daughters. We did not get Joy as a server, I made sure to check their names. I think she was off in the middle of the day, maybe working nights only.   Anyway, we sat down and the two girls that sat us/served us were very nice and friendly. I give three stars just for them being cool. I looked over the sushi menu, and all but three (I think) rolls were listed as spicy. I do not eat anything spicy. I am weird, yes I know, but I want to taste every flavor in my food rather than burn my mouth so I can guess if it is good or not. I ordered the Las Vegas roll, and requested regular salmon instead of baked salmon along with nothing spicy at all please. Also ordered the baked scallop roll. We got our older daughter the lunch special of Teriyaki beef, and our newborn we got some hot water to make her a bottle :P (she's one month old). The beef came out first, and all three of us tried a piece. It did not taste that great, and not much flavor to it at all. I ate the miso soup instead. Next came the Las Vegas roll, in which the plate had six super slim pieces of sushi with jalapenos on them.  I was pretty upset, but figured I would pull them off and hope my mouth didn't get burned from jalapeno juice left on the rice. I didn't taste anything spicy, but wow my mouth had this horrible taste of baked salmon. I believe it was fresh, so please don't think it was bad but I just can't stand that weird taste of baked salmon. I gave the rest of the roll to my wife, and told her I would help eat what she couldn't of the next roll. Out comes the baked scallop roll, and this thing is huge. I mean it covered the entire plate. I was very impressed, and thought they totally redeemed themselves. I took a piece, and it tasted like pieces of no flavor fish on a California roll. I do mean absolutely no flavor. I asked my wife to try it so I could know if it was my taste buds or not, and she had the same result. I told her I didn't want to eat any more of it, and was very disappointed about the food. So my wife, being the good girl she is, ate that roll also so it wouldn't go to waste. I couldn't believe it, we paid almost $25.00 for something that Teharu sushi sells for $3.00, and they have a ton of flavor when it's fresh.   If you have eaten here, and think my story is bogus, then don't worry because I am very picky when it comes to sushi. I am still looking for good sushi like I have had in northern California.   So as if the food was not bad enough, the cooks did the same thing as another yelper mentioned. They started changing, and turned off the lights around where we were. The servers were still nice and friendly, but wow it felt like a "hint hint. . . . . Get out now!!" from the cooks.  So breakdown: 3 stars = Service from the girls 1 star   = Food -2 stars = the cooks not getting the order right, and being pushy for us to leave.

This is my second time coming here, and I must say that the cupcakes are great. They have a lot of choices for cupcakes, and everything I have tasted has been awesome.  I will break it down into Pros & Cons.   Pros: Awesome taste plenty of choices So far the girl that helped me has been nice (have not dealt with other staff) Nice decorations   Cons: Staff is never there when you walk in, and do not show up for several minutes limited cake flavors   I will expand on this last one. Every cupcake appears to be the same but with different toppings on top. It would be nice to have different flavors of cake with different toppings. Example would be that the Raspberry cupcake is regular cake with Raspberry frosting. I was hoping for Raspberry cake with some frosting stuff. Is that weird to want that?  Overall this place is great for when you want a spendy but good tasting cake. The high prices will for sure help me not have too many repeat visits, and help with me losing weight. :)

Awesome place. Burgers are sometimes a little salty, but for the most part they are always good. Fries are great, and with their fry sauce, they are simply the best.  To cook is always friendly, and the girls working the counter are always nice & never pushy.  I found that the owner although very nice, can be a little protective over his fry sauce. Either that or I am a pig with the fry sauce. I can't help it, it's amazing.  I like that they not only have the 3lb burger challenge, but also have pics of people that completed it. The one that blows me away is the picture of this petite little girl who has completed the challenge 3 times, and most recent time was in a little over 4 minutes.   All in all, I love this place.

Best Hawaiian food in AZ, hands down. My wife and I moved to Tempe, and still make the drive to come here.   Now with that being said, here's the deal.  There must be 2 different cooks, because 95% of the time the food is perfect. Very few times (tonight being one of them) the meat is mostly fat, Grissel, and cartilage. It makes me very sad because I drive so far just to eat here.   I can see how people give this place negative reviews if they eat here with the bad cook. But please come back on a different day and give them another try.   Still giving them 5 stars because when the food is good, it's perfect.

Due to my yelp friend Karen W. I went back here. After the first visit, I swore I would not support a place that sells monkey brains. I found out now that they are not real monkey brains.   The food is a bit pricey, and there is really only one roll that amazes me (the Bull roll). The soup is good, but their salad dressing is not traditional Miso salad dressing. Some people like it, so I will not mark them down for that. I am going to go back when they have their happy hour for 1/2 price sushi.  Thank you Karen.
