I've not tried any of the Boba drinks, so I cannot comment on them.  What I can say is that the donuts are very very good.  They are extremely fresh if you get them in the morning right before work and go great with coffee.  I am very disappointed that they don't have creme-filled Long Johns.  I asked the woman behind the counter if she could make some and she said they don't sell well.  I disagree.   I've never sat in the building and ate, just ran in and got served right away and off to work.  You should bring cash unless you want to pay a small charge for running a credit card.

I really enjoy a trip to the fish market every once in a while. I'm surprised it doesn't have more average stars, but I thought about it and here is why it gets the ratings it does. It's a great place for happy hour sushi which happens to be every day of the week from five to seven and even til close on Mondays. The fish is extremely fresh(it's flown in fresh twice daily so it better be) and it is very tasty. I once had a very rare tuna steak for dinner and even though I realized it wasn't for me I could still appreciate it's freshness and taste. The only thing I would rate lower is the price since it can be quite expensive when paying full price.  The location is great and the staff have always been attentive and friendly. I enjoy the fish market for a weekday or weekend happy hour sushi night and especially on a monday.

What a perfect treat after a strenuous cardiovascular workout?! This Phoenix secret is definitely on my list of restaurants to visit again. Just don't eat here too often as the fare is high in carbs and saturated fat. The food is served hot out of the kitchen as soon as it's ready, so there is little wait time. It's a good idea to remember your order number and meal name as the person bringing out the order probably won't be your server. Although the service was rushed, it's what I expected from a busy, family-owned restaurant on a Sunday morning.   Before a table was clear, I was reminded of waiting outside to be seated at a popular restaurant in New York City in the chilly winter wind and snow, expect it was a warm fall morning and we were definitely not in Manhattan. The decor was minimal, but clean and finding the place took some extra effort (if you are coming from the north on Central its right after Buckeye and there is no sign). For a taste of the Southeast right in the middle of the Southwest, stop in at LoLo's, fo' sho'.

I think my expectations were too high when I tried out this place the past weekend with my fellow food critic, Marisa. We found it on yelp and we were encouraged by the good reviews, but it's possible that these were all written by past Chandler high grads with nostalgia in their heads. We arrived on a Saturday at two pm to avoid the school crowd and were greeted with a line and a full house. This gave us time to peruse the menu and decide on a combo plate. We both got the burrito and I got the strips and an extra taco. The strips are regular tortilla chips with cold grated cheddar cheese. Not what I expected from the reviews and not satisfying. The taco was in a hard shell that was freshly made and defintely benefited from the packet of red sauce thrown in the bag. The burrito with verde sauce was very spicy, very runny, which made it hard to eat and enjoy. The beef inside was good but I still had a hard time eating it. The girl behind the counter was very nice despite the constant interruptions for refills and more customers. She happened to be elmers daughter, so it was nice to know that we were supporting local business. Fortunately I'm not in Chandler much and have access to other local Mexican food restaraunts in phoenix.

I just read the last review by Mike and I want to second his comment about the defects of Barrio. The prices are definitely higher than what I am used to for dinner and the portions could be seen as small. We went after having some chips and guacamole as snacks at my house knowing the wait for a table would be over an hour (we were warned ahead of time by several people that we would have to wait, especially on a Saturday night). We sat outside on some benches and watched as three groups of people came and left due to the wait. We were seated in less time that quoted which is always a nice surprise. The waiter was very busy with all of his tables and we felt that he could have used some help. The fresh guacamole we ordered was supposed to be made at the table, but because we were seated in a corner surrounded by other tables, he made it in front of the other tables and brought it to us. That was very disappointing as I felt he really did not make an effort to provide us with the entertainment that the guacamole making provides. The food arrived in the expected time and was just right to eat. Each of us ordered a different taco plate and shared the meal which was fun to get to sample each meat. I ordered the pork knowing that it was delicious and I was very satisfied by the texture and flavor. I recommend that dish for anyone who goes to the Cafe. We finished the meal with a shared portion of the churro and ice cream dessert. Very satisfying. I will go back again, but not anytime soon.

Richardson's has got to be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. There are several reasons for this, mainly the food, the ambiance, and the service. I've now been there six times and can say with confidence that Richardson's is consistently a great dining experience. Today I ate the Huevos Rancheros, spicy with green chili sauce and shared part of the Carne Adovada, tender and excellently seasoned. I will definitely get some kind of pork dish like the adovada next visit because I loved it. The prickly pear Patron margarita was a great compliment to the meal. At past visits, I've tried the seafood pasta, pork chops, and enchiladas all of which were very good (I went out on a limb with the pork chops and although good, I'm still not a fan in general). Definitely order a house salad and green chili potato or share one with a friend as these are truly distinctive tastes of Richardson's. The service is friendly and to the point which comes across as commonsense customer service. My favorite part of Richardson's (and Dick's Hideaway) is the mood which is set by the dim lighting and adobe style booths and bar. The candlelight flickering around the room makes you feel very private and slightly romantic. This is a great place for out of town guests, dinner meetings, or just a night out. It gets busy during the evening on the weekdays and is on the smaller side, so I like to go a little earlier to miss the crowd.  The outside of the plaza where Richardson's is is under renovation, so I'm excited to see it will look like fresh and new.  Hope to see you there!

I have to give a little back story about what brought us to this fantastic Phoenix eatery.  A group of friends and I formed a group called he Sunday Brunch Society, SBS for short, with the sole purpose to "strengthen our friendship through regularly scheduled meetings."  We diligently drafted bylaws and have been successful in our first two meetings.  This was to be our third and it was my turn to choose the location.  I had heard about this restaurant having excellent brunch on several different occasions, so I decided to give it a try.  We were thrilled with the place and plan to come back soon.  There was a little wait for a table inside, but there were benches to use and we sat in an alcove of the outdoor courtyard.  Despite the chill in the air, we had a pleasant chat while listening to the live music being played by a Bohemian looking gentlemen on a guitar.  I would definitely recommend eating outside; just bring several layers of clothes if it is cold.  You can sit at tables scattered along the side and front lawns or on the porch, each with its own perspective of the old house the restaurant inhabits.    We were seated near the front door, but the rush of people coming in and out from the small kitchen and coffee bar made me feel like we had come to the place where everyone wanted to be.  Both Shaina and I had a mocha latte that was delicious and super frothy.  The menu is limited, but we all had no problem in deciding that we were each going to try the sweet potato pancakes.  Great choice!  They were out quickly and steaming hot.  The price was reasonable, but not cheap.  If you have the "urge," walk back to the bathrooms and check out the artistic renditions on the walls and ceilings along with the rumpled metal stalls.  They are a real work of art.

After running a 5 K it's always a good idea to fill up on some heavy carbs, fat, and protein. It's the best excuse I have to pig out and feel only a fraction of the guilt. Black Bear was a great experience for us hungry runners. We brought out appetites and they satisfied us with no room to spare. The platters of food came out quick and heaping. The Original bear claw pastry is great to share, just make sure to eat it before it cools, which will be no problem at all. The coffee is actually drinkable without adding heaps of sugar and cream, not what you'd expect from a franchise, traditional diner. The mugs were so cute I wanted to take one home which I'm sure I could have since they sold an assortment of Black Bear memorabilia also. For five people the bill was just over $50 which is a value! I had the homemade Italian spice sausage patties that were made crisp and savory, while the rest of the group had granola pancakes, the "Volcano" of pancakes and eggs, and fruit platter. Everyone was satisfied, full, and ready to hibernate the day away.

I love how this place is so unassuming and I hope it is able to make it in Phoenix. I decided to do lunch there as I've passed by it a million times and also tried stopping by there during business hours and it wasn't open! Well I know hippies and sometimes they lose track of time... Anyway, the parking was easy to find as I pulled into the alleyway just west of the building and squeezed my way into a space behind the building. The smell of cooking beef hit me square in the face as I stepped out of my car and I observed people eating burgers on the back patio. So far so good! The menu was easy to read and I tried the lunch special of a specialty burger of my choice (excellent to get to choose!), fries, and a Shasta (creme soda for me) for $5.25. The cramped lobby was filled with people waiting for their food and I noticed many people coming in and out, thinking this must be a good take out place. I sat outside and hoped to attract more passerbys to the restaurant as many people gawked as they drove by at the businesses at that busy stretch of Indian School. Got my bag of food and ate outside under the fans and shaded patio- wonderful! Juicy guacamole burger with nothing needed to be added to it and crispy shoe string fries made for a meal I couldn't even finish. Loved it! Will be back very very soon!

I'm here at Stacy's right now and I was loving it so much I had to stop in the middle of my yelp to enjoy it. This is authentic BBQ and very worth the wait. You need cash so make sure you stop at the ATM before you go. The two of us shared a pound of rib tips and a side of sweet potato fries while I personally enjoyed a cup of tangy coleslaw and sweet, I mean sweet lemonade. The ribs were easy to pull off the bone and had extra crispy pieces I liked a lot. The BBQ sauce was amazing and had a smokey flavor so the name really says it all. The fries were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and really could have been the dessert. For a good price we had a great meal right in the heart of central Phoenix. I can't wait to take someone else there.

This place is close by so I thought I would try it out. My normal nail salon is at Christown mall and Rose the pedicurist is the best so I came in here with high expectations.  We were greeted when we came in and were able to make a walk in appointment. The place is bright and clean. The man at the desk was friendly enough and we got in earlier than we planned.  From there the experience was less than I had hoped. I got the basic pedicure and the price was good compared to Scottsdale and other downtown locations. The nail and cuticle trim was very rushed and so was the foot scrub and massage. She did not put in any effort to remove ingrown nail at all. My friend had a full pedicure package and was cut too close and had an infection in the next three days. I waited patiently for my friend to finish while watching shoppers pass by at Arizona center. I don't know if the pedicurists were rushed or if this is the quality of work, but this experience was worse than expected.  Overall, I was impressed with the all appearances but the work was disappointing. Although I can walk here, I would rather drive fifteen minutes to get a thorough job at my other salon.
