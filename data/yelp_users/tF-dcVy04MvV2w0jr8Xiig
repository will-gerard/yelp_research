Came here because the big box places didn't have the right size drain fitting. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. He made sure I understood how to install, as well.

Had dinner here last night (Friday night). We arrived a little before 8, had to wait a short time for a table. The bar area is new, since I was last here & looked inviting! As for the food...we ordered Fromaggio di Capra & Caprese to start. The goat cheese started was not what we expected. The flavor was a little bland & the crostini was toasted a little too dark. I would not order it again. The Caprese was good, nice fresh basil. I had Penne with Strangola & my friend ordered Penne with Bolognese. The Strangola was very good. The sausage was very fresh tasting and mild. The onion pieces could have been a bit smaller but that is a minor issue. The Bolognese was a nice, not overly rich sauce. Both dishes were very good.  The bread was very good, fresh and light, served with a plate of olive oil (a bit bland) & seasonings. The service was a bit chaotic. Very friendly, but a bit confused (back up staff). Overall, a good place to eat in east Mesa.

Tonight we stopped in again, on a whim. A drizzly  Wednesday night and the place was packed!  We ate at the bar tonight. Service was great, thank you Kenji, as was the food. I had tonight's special, portobello stuffed ravioli. My young man had his favorite, the brunello tortellini. The ravioli was served in a mushroom, garlic cream sauce. Not too rich, it complimented the ravioli nicely. The brunello was great, as usual; sautéed pancetta and peas with tri color cheese tortellini in a garlic cream sauce.  Tiramisu was in order for dessert. It is house made and very delicious. Definitely a gem in north east Mesa.

I am using this firm based on my neighbors recommendation. Freddy arrived on time and got right to work. He was fast, efficient and professional. The pests don't stand a chance!

It's very bright and cheerful here. We can walk in for a nail clipping on the fly! Staff is super friendly. The washing station looks great but we have not used it yet.

I called to ask for a late afternoon appointment to have some standard maintenance done. They were able to accommodate my schedule and got the job done in just over an hour. Staff is very friendly. I felt the price was fair.

It's been a while since we've been here... They no longer have the onion rings on the menu? What is the world coming to??

The girls that work here are all very friendly and do a great job with my son's hair. The price is very reasonable.  The shop is always clean. And being able to still watch a game while he's getting a haircut is great!

I went to Flicka's to see a friend's band play.  There was one server who only appeared to be clearing away empty glasses and plates.  I never saw her taking a drink order.  I went to the bar where there were two very over worked bartenders.  I asked for a drink and was told they don't carry that brand of gin.  I then asked for a Kiltlifter beer...again, they don't carry that beer.  Was finally able to get a beer that I liked and went back to our table.   Shortly after, the "bouncer" said he had a party of 50 or 60 people coming in and he would have to take our table... Overall, I did not think that Flicka's had anything to recommend it.

This is a nice, casual bar with plenty of TV's for sports fans.  The entire staff is very friendly; they take the time to know the regulars and make you feel welcome.  The food is very good (California Chicken Wrap is my favorite and my son can't stay away from the brownie sundae!). It's our favorite "go to" place.

I don't claim to be an expert on gelato, but I do know that this place is fantastic. They always have 18 to 24 flavors...a great variety. Tonight I had "The Fruits of the Forest" and "Limoncello".; they were both light and refreshing. My son had "South African Dark Chocolate", "Salted Caramel" and Stracciatella".  The salted caramel was his favorite; all three flavors got two thumbs up! The service is always very friendly and helpful.  They have several tables inside and a couple outside. It's nice that they are open late, too!

We come here pretty regularly. The BBQ chicken pizza is a favorite of my son's and I love the thin crust Mediterranean pizza with white sauce. They will always customize my pizza for me, which is greatly appreciated. The wings are usually really good. Especially when they are extra hot! The salads are always fresh and very good.  Destinie is always very sweet and takes excellent care of everyone in the bar! It's nice to feel welcomed when we are here.  Happy hour deals are really good. The beer is ice cold! Excellent selection too! Added bonus...lots of sports available!

I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed.  The "Chile Verde Birdie" is my favorite sandwich. There is a very wide variety of items on the menu to suit any taste. The service is always very good, polite and welcoming. They always have great music playing! Today was a very jazzy selection of Christmas songs! You cannot go wrong here!

First, let me say that I highly recommend the "under the sheet" cocktail!  I have been here a couple times and have been very pleased each time.  Bianco pizza with added mushrooms is wonderful. The carne pizza is very good. Standard BLT on ciabatta was simply delightful!

I've been coming here for years. The pork egg rolls are usually very good. My son loves the orange flavored chicken, though sometimes it can be overly sweet. I always like the Four Seasons or Shrimp & Beef in Kung Pao sauce.  The sauces are not overwhelming & the veggies are always crisp and fresh. The pot stickers, however, are a disappointment. Overall, a good, quick, inexpensive place for Chinese takeout.

We've been coming here regularly since this location opened about 6 years ago. I love the green chili pork. The pork is very tender, the sauce is flavorful and spicy.  The barrio tacos are also really good. There is a good selection of beers on tap; so happy that they have local craft brewers featured. The service is always great. The bar area has enough tables to see the sports action on any of three TV's. In nicer weather, the patio is a great place to relax and enjoy dinner.

Ted has been a member of our family for just over 2 months. He has been great with the neighborhood dogs so we thought it was time to go to the dog park.  We were immediately greeted by a couple of very large, very sweet Labs. From that moment on, Ted was in heaven! When we initially arrived, there were only 3 dogs there, but soon after there were about 8 additional dogs to play with. All the dogs were very nice and well behaved, as were their parents :) There are lots garbage cans, plenty of benches, and many shade trees. This is a great place; can't wait to go back!

Came here with some friends on a Saturday afternoon. It was really quiet; I assume due to the holiday weekend.   I must admit, I was worried when I saw the exterior, but the inside was a nice surprise. Cindy was our server. She was great!  We ordered the Lobster Benedict and a the Green Chili "burger"; but at Cindy's suggestion changed out the beef for chicken. The lobster was tender, quite a lot of it, the eggs cooked perfectly, the green chili added a very nice flavor and the hollandaise was great...very rich! The chicken "burger" was incredible. Everything was very tasty...but best of all? $8 bottomless champagne!  We will definitely be back for dinner!

I've been here a number of times over the past couple of years; however, I doubt I will go back.  The good: the prices are very good. The service is also good. It's generally not overly crowded. There is all there is to recommend it, unfortunately.   The bad: a group of us went to see the divas of comedy a couple of months ago. They were all very base and not at all funny comediennes.  We went again tonight for the New Year's Eve show. It was the most disorganized disaster I have witnessed masquerading as a stand up comedy act.  The host most of his monologue speaking Spanish, the first comedian followed this up with more monologue in Spanish with explanations in English. They allowed a customer to get on stage and heckle the host before the main act. The main act was also not funny at all.  We could not get out of there soon enough. It's the first time I've seen so many people leave before the show ended.  Save your time and money... Go elsewhere.

We arrived earlier than required. They took us back right away. They treated my son with respect and as an adult. The entire staff was courteous and professional. They are able to accommodate our scheduling preferences without issue.

Tried to have dinner here tonight but had to leave. We arrived at 6:45, waited about 10 minutes to order...only one person was taking orders. The dining room was less than half full, the patio even less so. Our beverages were delivered promptly. That is where the fun stops.  We waited over 35 minutes and still no food. I asked for a refund.  I would have been happier if the shift manager would have picked up the price of the beverages; as a customer service, but that did not happen.  On the plus side, the beer was served in a frosty mug and the "Nutter-Butter" milkshake was delicious.  I wish I could have reviewed the burgers!

I found Wise Home Services through "Living Social". I had 2 hours of cleaning time using the "deal".   Tim was on time, explained the service; the time would probably cover thoroughly cleaning 3 bathrooms & dust mopping the downstairs floor (& mopping if time allowed). He did a great job...everything in each bathroom was cleaned very well. There was just enough time to dust mop the tile floors downstairs.  I have scheduled a full house cleaning...will update this afterward!

I had my second float today. I do believe I am hooked! I left feeling very relaxed.  I was warmly greeted and immediately shown to my "room". She explained the features of the pod I was using.  I was able to calm my mind and even slept a little, I think!  When I emerged, I felt very relaxed and refreshed.  The experience overall has been very good.  I am going to continue to use True REST float.

We decided on a whim to try this place out. No one greeted is we walked in, so we asked about seating. We started my sitting on the patio. After 15 minutes, when no server came to our table, we went inside. We ordered sweet potato fries & wings to start, and a The Mo (spinach, tomato & feta) pizza & a meatball sub. The starters arrived at different times. The fries were crisp but didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The wings came about 10 minutes after the fries. I ordered medium but they had were very mild. The carrot & celery should have never left the kitchen, they were so dried out! About 10 minutes after the starters were cleared, the pizza arrived...ten minutes after that the sub arrived! The pizza had clump of frozen, tasteless spinach.  The meatball sub would have been better at a Quizo's or Subway! We have no intention of returning.

With limited, decent places for breakfast in the far East Valley, Over Easy is a keeper. I had the Mediterranean Omelet today; it was wonderful. My server, Matt, was very good...attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely be coming back.

Ok...four of us for breakfast, on a busy Saturday morning.  Our server was pleasant. Beverage orders were delivered quickly, breakfast orders were placed. Three of our plates arrived. The fourth "is coming right out". Our server came by to ask how everything was..."fine, but we are still missing the fourth dish". She did not seem concerned nor did she apologize. The hostess/floor manager came to say that the order was coming out shortly. She did apologize for the delay. The fourth item finally arrived about 10 to 15 minutes after the first plates were delivered.  The up side was that the food was very good and they comped the delayed fourth plate. The down side is the lack of concern shown by the server and that we had to ask for coffee refills.

We were warmly greeted when we arrived and promptly seated. Our server was very polite, pleasant and attentive. I wanted a glass of wine but didn't have a wine list but our server brought one as soon as I asked.  We ordered a Cesar salad to share. My son ordered pizza & I had the scallops with mushroom risotto. Everything was very good. The scallops were perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that pizza came before we finished our salad and before my scallops.  One other minor point of contention; there was no-one at the hostess stand when we left; it sort of felt like our evening was unfinished without being thanked for visiting or wished a good evening. We will be back; hopefully the very small annoyances will be resolved.

My first time here...Erica was great...perfect attitude for the place!  Pizza was very good, drinks were good, but the  place was a little slow for a Thursday Happy Hour.  Lots of sports action to behold! Will definitely be back.

I bought my 30 year old home two years ago. It had a water softener already. It stopped working so I called the service number provided. The service rep did not once talk about coming to look at my system; only wanted to sell me a monthly service.  I did a little research and I found Integrity; Bryan was able to accommodate my schedule, to come look at my system. He found that it was able to be repaired. He was able to get the needed parts & come the next morning at a time that was convenient to my schedule.  He also installed a new R.O. system, so we can have great tasting water without all the plastic waste!  It took just over an hour to complete the job. I found Bryan to be professional, friendly & very easy to work with.

Let me start by saying "holy cow!!" This was our first time here.  We had the king crab, shrimp, mussels & crawfish. All were medium spiced (a bit on the mild side) and trifecta. We also had hush puppies, onion rings, fries & fried calamari. The king crab and calamari were the favorites at our table. The hush puppies were tasty and moist. We ordered corn bread, but they were out (noon on a Sunday? Wow) The service was very good but the food came out in odd spurts and we did have to ask for missing items. It is a lot of fun and really messy! The hand washing stations are a cool benefit!

I stopped in here for dinner before heading over to a coffee shop for some music. It was pretty busy and the staff was a little frantic!  I sat at the bar and waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. There were a couple of other people at the bar that were also waiting to be served. The guy behind the bar was very nice and apologized for the delay.   The chips were very good; thick & crunchy. I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos.  They were pretty good, if a little on the bland side. Adding some salsa helped.   Overall, it looks like a nice place. The menu had a lot of variety. I think, if they were a little more organized & prepared for a busy Saturday night, it would have been a much better experience.  At least the chaos provided a topic of conversation for the people sitting at the bar!

Gourmet taco plate: Baja Shrimp taco Braised Pork taco Absolutely delicious  Salsa flight (5 choices) very good (pico, good; Roasted tomato and poblano, very good; Roasted corn and garlic crema, good; Habanero, great; Chipotle, great) Service started out a little aloof but warmed up as lunch progressed.  Interior is nice, but very small. Big tables, bar looks nice.  This place will be hard to get into once "the people" catch wind of it! Let's keep it our secret for now.

We decided to try Pita Island; it's super close to home and we really like to support local business.  The menu is a bit limited but it looks like that will be changing soon.  On our first visit we ordered a hummus starter and a couple of gyros (with fries). They were nice enough to let us get half traditional and half jalapeño hummus. I can't decide which tasted better! The pita was delicious too. The gyro pitas were so good! The meat was thinly sliced, tender and wonderful. The fries were cooked perfectly. There was so much food, though. We were stuffed by the time we left! The service is friendly and fast. The dining area is very large, clean and welcoming.  We are looking forward to visiting often.
