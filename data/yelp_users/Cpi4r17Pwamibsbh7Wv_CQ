The eel sauce on the sushi was gag worthy and the service was almost as bad. At least the prices on the sake bombs were reasonable so we could drink away the disappointment.   1/10, won't be back.

Good food and a friendly staff makes this breakfast place a nice stop when you don't have a ton of time. Order at the counter and they'll bring the food to you while you enjoy a quiet ambience and the nearby mountains.
