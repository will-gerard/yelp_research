Don't have a pool and looking for a place to cool off in the hot summer months? Look no further, this is the place.  Hotel San Carlos has a pool on the third floor. It has a bar and a spot for a dance floor that quickly fills up as the DJ's pump in house music, and the drinks start to flow. They do "Adult Swim" on Saturday's and Sunday's - you don't have to be a guest at the hotel to go. Everyone is welcome and you can bring your own booze~ It is a lot better than other places (say the Mondrian) as the people are chill and you don't have to be a supermodel or look like one to go there. I would recommend this spot to anyone (out of town or not) as a nice place to cool off and relax during the weekend.

Making the rounds on all the wonderful mexican food places the south side has to offer I found myself here. I can't believe how many times I have drove by this place and never stopped in. The dining room is humongous, you could probably fit 500 people in it.  It is a bit brightly lit but squint your eyes and dive into the salsa, it is really awesome. I must say I was not impressed with my lunch order, I got the tacos and they were dripping with grease. I think they make the tacos, lettuce tomatoes and all, then threw them in the fryer (yuck). I think I just made a bad choice though as the dishes others ordered, (fajitas and seafood plates) looked delicious. They give you a really yummy soup at lunch time. It consisted of broth, rice and veggies and was very flavorful. The waitress was sweet and attentive and the margaritas were great (if you like them made with limeaid, which I do).

Los Olivos how could I ever cheat on you!   I am ashamed to say I've been stepping out on you and visiting other washes.. I'm sorry but they were closer, faster, less expensive, and some even had tacos.   I've learned my lesson, you give the best hand jobs in town. Your staff is friendly, your store has great magazines to peruse through, and I could even get my shoes shined... I'll never cheat again..   I've learned my lesson, your quality work is worth the drive and the wait.

It's a restaurant, it's a bakery, it's a market, it's Laaaa Tolteca!   This place is fun, the restaurant has been around for years and the quality of food is still solid. The dishes are mainly authentic, you order at the counter and seat yourself in a huge dining room. It is not always the cleanest place but it is easy to find a table. I love the salsa bar, so many choices and pickled veggies. I love anything pollo grilled, and the carne asada (yes not the best in town) is flavorful and juicy.   Grab a horchata, order your meal and go by some dirt cheap pastries while you wait.

The food is not the best, but the phosphate fizzies are out of this world. The old-fashioned soda fountain reminds of when my gramps used to bring me here after gymnastics. It was our special Saturday date. The music supports the vintage theme and the thrift store is always stocked with rare finds.  Eat lunch elsewhere but stop in for a fizzy, you can thank me later.

I'm in love. The festive décor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.  We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink.   We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch! The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.  Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service.

I have become a huge fan of Bikram Yoga. I find the asanas flow nicely and I love the heat. At 104 degrees I begin sweating within about 10 minutes of class.   This studio is large and well equipped. There are changing rooms and showers and it is well kept up. If you happen to forget the bare necessities when coming to class you can rent a towel and they will provide you with water. I can't for the life of me see how this happens, but they have you covered if it does.   The instructors are all a bit different, and all very capable. (Gemma is my favorite).  I keep coming back here over other places in the valley because I really enjoy the class packages. You can buy 1, 5, 10, 25, monthly ect.. It is very flexible and there is no time limit on them (obviously other than the monthly packages..) They often run specials 10-20% off so signing up for the mailing lists is fruitful.   If you have never tried Bikram before make sure you bring your mat, a towel and water and come WELL HYDRATED.   Good luck, and Namaste!

I've never truly understood the Oregano's allure. It's a chain with the same menu and products in every location. There is always a wait for tables and rarely a seat at the bar. This is good for them but not for me.   I find their food average at best. The pizza is great, but everything else on the menu is subpar. I ordered the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain (you know all the yellow bits no one wants to eat) with a few soggy croutons and cucumbers. I ate less that a ¼ of it. I also got the meatballs that were doused in cheese to make up for their dryness but they weren't fooling anyone.   Our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so many great authentic locations in Phoenix I doubt I will be back.

DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!  I am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!  Fast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues.   And guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit.

I had almost forgot about the Rhythm Room, and then in the space of two weeks I have been twice. I saw Tim Reynolds (best known for his work with Dave Matthew's Live at Luther College) and the witty and wiry electronica band from the UK Fujiya & Miyagi. Neither of these bands would be considered Blues, but this gives you an appreciation for the diverse talent the Rhythm Room brings in.   Their sound system is great, the drinks are strong and the staff is friendly. The only improvement this place needs is a Marquee sign to remind us of all the great shows happening on a nightly basis.

Bad. Very bad. Ordered a combo: sour cream enchilada, taco and tostada. The shredded beef in the taco was harder than jerky, the enchilada was an oily mess and the tostada was soggy.   You can tell a lot about the type of food you are going to have by the salsa. True to form, the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce and the chunky sauce was about 80% jalapeno and no flavor.  There was a strange smell in the restaurant and I couldn't wait to leave.  I will not be back

For a chain Ajo Al's is pretty decent. Shrimp fajitas, tacos morongo and fish tacos are all really good. All their taco plates come with great side sauces (tomatillo, chipotle cream, avacado puree). They also make a pretty yummy breakfast burrito.  I'm not a huge fan of their salsa, but they have a decent hot sauce. Their sangria is not actual sangria made with wine, but a fruit juice blended drink (beware). Top shelf margs are awesome.  The place is usually packed and I have always had great service.

Cost Plus is awesome. I stop by here at least once a week as they have a fabulous wine selection and the prices are great. Their international food section contains items you can't find at AJ's or TJ's.   They also have nice house wares; I've bought decorative pillows, bath mats, shower curtains and wine glasses. Need a gift? This is a great place to find something unique and cool for anyone on your list.   It really is a World Market and you won't leave without buying a lot more than you anticipated.

I was pretty disappointed in my experience at DV. I made an appointment for 3 pedicures for 11:15, it was 11:45 before we were all in a chair. Strike one. They started on my friends before coming to me again throwing off the point of making an appointment for 3. Strike two. I opted for the $5 callus remover and she did an extremely poor job my feet are still rough and I can feel all the spots she missed. None of the techs were in the least bit friendly or personable.   There are so many nail joints in the area I won't be returning to this one.

I went to add this to my newly made list of favorite brunch spots and couldn't believe my eyes.. I hadn't reviewed PCG yet!?!  If someone were to ask me what my favorite brunch dish was, without batting an eye I would respond "Griddled corn cakes from PCG of course". Take corn cakes and cook them to perfection (you know with a few corn kernels stuck in there), stuff them with chicken, green chillis, jack cheese, serve them with salsa fresco, potatoes and black beans. This would also probably be my last meal on earth if I had a choice.  You feeling my taste buds? It honestly doesn't get any better.   Outside of brunch, the food here is amazing.  The Rose Lane Chicken, The Surf and Turf, any of the fish dishes.. Everything is made with quality ingredients nothing fancy and full of flavor. They do it right. I held my college graduation dinner here it is that good. I would recommend this to the pickiest of eaters, and it is great for groups.

Koller may be a tad pricier than your average hardware store, but I will gladly pay more for the exceptional service they provide. I just moved in to a new place and I have been here 3 times in the last week. Every time I walk in someone is there to help. The guys there love showing me where things are located or offering advice on my many home improvement projects. They are solid and make me glad that I can support a local business over a major conglomerate (That's right Home Depot I 'm talking to you).  It is not the largest store, but they seem to carry everything I need.  There is plenty of parking in the back and no one seems to know about it (well, until now that is).

No shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for Danny's. I wish I would have read them before I took my car in. Why you ask? Here goes:  They stole my change (probably over 15 bucks). Exterior was dripping with water and back was streaked with mud. They wrote on the car window, "basic wash" and it did not come off after the wash. If they vacuumed the interior I couldn't tell, I can tell you they didn't vacuum the floor mats, or the driver's side. They didn't wipe down the interior; there was still dust exactly where I left it.  Normally I would have back to complain, but after waiting over an hour I just wanted to get F out of there. Danny's should take some lessons from Los Olivos, they do a proper car wash.  1 Star is generous.

It's my own fault for coming back to this raper.   Typical story, went in for an oil change/car wash after recently having my car at a mechanics who assured me all my fluids were good. I could barely understand the mumbler that told me I needed brake fluid, transmission fluid, air filter, and some other filter. No thanks. Just the oil.  He came back with a bill for $98?? He charged me for gas. I didn't get gas. It took 20 minutes to get it sorted out. I was there almost two hours. Car wasn't clean. (Do they really vacuum?!!!)  Will I ever learn?

The customer service here was top notch! We came in to find a suit for my man, he is 6'6 and thin so finding clothes to fit him is near impossible.   We were greeted by Steve as soon as we walked in. Before we know it he had the measuring tape out and several different suit options in hand. He also gave recommendations on shirt and tie combinations. They were having a 40% off sale on the entire store so we got a great deal. They were also able to tailor the suit pants within 4 days.   I now have the exact pant and shirt measurements which will make it easy for future shopping extravaganzas.  Thanks Steve! You did a great job.

Armadillo has some pretty good grub for a bar. I highly recommend the fried green pickles and the smothered chicken.  Happy hour is spot on and they have off track betting. It's a great place to stop in for a few cold ones on a hot summer day.  It's a bit dark and dingy but that only adds to the charm. The servers and bartenders are super friendly. (My boyfriend talked me in to 4 stars for this review, he's a regular).

Hallelujah! This is the type of Italian I have been looking for. It's almost like sitting in  a kitchen. Small place, maybe 10 tables, plastic chairs, paper table coverings, menu written in chalk on boards in front. Fresh pasta on Fridays and BYOB with a $3 cork fee. Hot damn! I got the lobster ravioli (holy garlic it was good). Also tried the mozzarella so fresh and spongy, drizzled in evoo and balsamic... Yum.. Had to try the tiramisu disappointed by the small portion but little miss piggy had eaten enough so it was probably a good thing. If you don't like this place go to Olive Garden, it may be better suited for your taste duds.

I recently took my Movado watch in for repair. I was disappointed to hear it would have to be shipped out, but I was gauranteed it would be fixed within a few weeks.  The man actually doing the repair emailed me with a cost estimate and had me sign off before they began the work.   The watch was repaired, but it took much longer than I was promised (almost 6 weeks). In addition, after I got it home and inspected it I noticed it appeared as though they had left it in a cleaning solution for to long. The inside was tarnished and it took several polishing wipes later to get the stains off.   For the price I paid I would have expected a higher quality of care.

I've always been a big fan of TJ's and I really enjoy this particular location. They do tastings of wines and treats quite frequently and they always have fresh coffee out.   I look forward to getting the "Fearless Flyer" in the mail so I can see what new goods they are carrying each week. They have some great seasonings and spices that you can't find in any other stores. I also love the fact that the servings sizes are always small, so it works perfectly for single gals or couples.   Their produce section can be lacking variety, but whatever they carry is always fresh and in season. They also carry gorgeous flower arrangements cheaper than most other stores in the valley. I can't do all my shopping here due to the lack of toiletries and cleaning products, but if I am looking strictly for week night meals this is the perfect place.

Did I hear correctly? Are you closing? Lennnnnyyyy! Why!   The rumor is the owner Lenny Rosenberg is not renewing the lease to focus on his other restaurants, Deluxe and Revo Burrito.  I will miss this place. I have spent many a night at the beautiful bar and drank more saki than should have been legal in my early twenties. I was also able to extended my dollar when I was a broke college student thanks to the happy hour.  Kanpai Zen, you had a great fifteen years!

I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff, we had a very big group and they were attentive and got our drinks and orders in right away. The view of the city was breathtaking and I would come back for happy hour, but just to watch the sunset and a have a cocktail.    That being said... Geordie's restaurant had horrible food. Honestly, one star at best. I had the Cesar salad which was fishy with stale croutons. I also tried the beet and goat cheese salad and I kept looking around for the goat cheese, I had one small dollop hiding under a bib of lettuce. The carpaccio was the worst I have ever tasted. I think the cut may have been bad and I couldn't take more than two bites. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries; they were the only part of my meal that was anything more than mediocre. For my main I had the tenderloin and it was tough and chewy, the potatoes that came on the side were a joke.    I've been told that Wrigley has the "pay what you will" for lunch. If they applied this to the dinner they served I would left with a much heavier wallet. All in all the over hyped experience left me quite under whelmed. Sure it is a great place to impress your out of town guests with, for the view and history alone. Just take them somewhere else for dinner (like Dick's or Café Barrio) if you want an impressive meal.

I love Keegan's ribs! A full rack is a steal at 20 bucks. I usually order by phone and pick them up and take home sided with steamed broccoli and cheesy potatoes. Last night I tried the crème brule and it was creamy and carmely deliciousness.   They have a great happy hour if you are in the hood, and this is also a wonderful place to take your grandparents. It is one of my grannies faves.

No wonder Barb's has won so many awards, the deserts here are phenomenal!  We came in right before closing on a Sunday (Yelps hours were listed wrong), and they were still willing to accommodate us. We tried a few of the cupcakes to see which one we wanted made in to a cake for my friend's birthday. The choice was tough as all of them were so delicious. A few of my favorites:  Pink Champagne - Vanilla cake with sparkling pink champagne, topped with champagne mousse and edible pearl and silver beads. It was heaven. Cosmo - Cranberry cake, filled with orange cream, topped with vodka lime cream icing, and rimmed with strawberry sugar and a crystallized lime slice. Strawberry cheesecake - Cheesecake on top of vanilla cake, topped with whip cream, and surrounded and dusted with graham cracker crust, and a dollop of strawberry. In addition to the cupcakes they gave us donuts and a few pastries for free since they were about to close. I think that was the best apple fritter I have ever tried. It had huge delicious chunks of apple in it.   We're going with the Pink Champagne cake and I will post a picture once we pick it up.

I have read so many rave reviews on the veggie burger I passed up the French Dip and gave it a go. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Was it an off day? The patty was covered in a sweet soy sauce that overpowered the burger. It was so sweet in fact I sent it back (I hate doing that). The new burger she brought (minus said sauce) was not impressive either. There was a serious consistency issue, it crumbled with every bite. A good veggie burger should stay formed while eating.. Another drawback is that it is 12 bucks, way to pricey for what you get. I'll happily pay 16 for the French Dip, it's well worth it.  Our server was excellent and all the other options I have tried there have been great earning 4 stars. Word to the wise, if you like syrupy veggie patties that fall apart go with the veggie burger, otherwise be a carnivore and destroy the French Dip. Like I wish I would have today.

I see Shayna Mansfield and she is a really wonderful doctor. She takes the time to listen to your issues and doesn't push prescriptions on you like so many other doctors. Her assistant is great with follow up and very friendly.  There have been times when I had to see other doctors (while she was on maternity leave) and they were also pretty great. The facility is easy to find and the check I process is fast and easy (mostly). I highly recommend her and Mountain View as a solid PCP/Home Physician office.

What can I add this place rocks for so many reasons...  If you are a vegetarian get the Zuni burrito (whole wheat tortilla filled with tofu "chorizo", corn, spinach, egg and served with salsa) it is delicious!  The French pancakes w/ honey, fresh fruit and crème fraîche are fantastic (think crepes)!  Order at the coffee counter, it will save you a ton of time.  Sipping a latte and people watching absolutely rules here.

I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else.   On the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible.  My friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush. The sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.  Like I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow.

After so may 4 and 5 star reviews I decided to give Taylor's another chance after my first visit, thinking perhaps I just had a bad experience and this place really is as great as everyone raves.. So now on to my second dining adventure and I am still not impressed.  The place is cute, it has a great charm and ambiance, really a perfect setting for a causal breakfast or lunch. The food is decent, but nothing exceptional and extremely overpriced.. My first time I had the huevos rancheros and they really should have been called huevos gringos. The dish consisted of beans folded into a wheat tortilla with a fried egg and very bland tomatillo sauce, what side do you get for 9.25$ - chips...needing more than chips I added a side of potatoes ($3),  I split this dish and was charged ($2) without even being asked.. Bringing the total dish to $14.25.. Get real for breakfast? .  I compare this dish to Harlow's huevos rancheros.. there is $7.95 and comes with potatoes and beans and tortillas.. My second visit I ordered the "create your own omelet" for $10.75, this seemed high for an omelet but I went with it.. It was pretty good, but again the side... toast or a bagel, order the potatoes ($3) and another split plate charge ($2) without being asked.. Let me rant on this one for a moment.. They charge me $2 to cut my omlettee in half.. The bagel already comes sliced. LAME, bring it on one plate and I can cut it myself..it is not like we got double portions.. very annoying. So now the omelet is $15.95 ridiculous. Add an OJ.. $5 bucks! When most places have $3 mimosas on Sundays I found paying $5 for an OJ ridiculous. So in all Taylor's food is decent, but with so many good and lower priced options in the nearby area, I don't seem myself going back.

Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea.   Then the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages.   Our horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements.

I took my car here for an advertised basic wash $8.99, I drive a 98 Jetta k2 model. Once I pull in they tell me they have to hand wash my car because I have a rack on top. Puzzled, because I have taken this car to Danny's, Olivia's and numerous other auto car washes and never had a problem, I inquire further. They then explain that my rack isn't factory so the hand wash will be $24.99.. Not factory? I ask.. the rack came with the car, it's a k2 model..That was the big selling point of these cars 10 years ago.. The guy continues to argue with me in a pretty hostile tone so I decide to go somewhere else. I drive less than 2 miles away and see another auto car wash, I pull in they give my ticket and wash my car in the machine for $11.99. I give Simoniz 1 star for having no idea what they are talking about and being rude in their ignorance.

I'm torn. They have great deals at times, like buy 1 get 2 free packages of boneless skinless chicken breasts. But they also have crappy bread and produce, last time I went there the strawberries I bought that looked fine rotted within a day, the tortillas all stuck together and the bread went moldy. I didn't save my receipt because I have never had to return anything to a grocery store before.. I guess I will limit my shopping to frozen foods or smoking deals.

Hands down the best delivery I have had in years. Feeling to lazy to cook I ordered Spinato's last night. I got the super six pizza, thin crust, well done with extra sauce, a small dinner salad and a side order of meatballs.   The pizza was Chicago style and phenomenal! (See pictures) The pizza ingredients were really fresh and the sauce (OH THE SAUCE) tangy and sweet. The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza. Spinato's beats any delivery in my area (Sorry Pat's) and has made the rotation in to my favorite Chicago style pizza. I can't wait to actually try the restaurant, I heard they have great specials and BYOB.

There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite.

I came here with a group of 12 on Saturday morning for breakfast. We all arrived at separate times and agreed that the signs directing you to the restaurant were confusing. All of us got lost, but the detours enabled us to tour the beautiful resort. The Pointe Tapatio is gorgeous, wonderful cliffs, great design... Now if only the restaurant could improve..  Once we were all seated we waited (and waited and waited) to order. The server appeared to take our drink order, perhaps not realizing we had been sitting there for over half an hour and were prepared to order food as well. When he finally returned we were salivating hyenas, yet still more than half the table were unhappy with the meal placed before them.  While we waited an eternity for our food to arrive I looked around the restaurant and noticed how dirty it was. There were 3 separate tables where it looked as though they spilled a pitcher of ice on the floor and didn't bother cleaning it up. We actually saw a busser carrying a tray full of glasses with OJ spilling all over the floor, we called it out to our server but he was nonplussed and took no action.  On to the food: My personal experience was the best. I ordered an egg, ham and cheese bagel, they brought it out cold with the cheese unmelted. I asked the waiter to have the cooks throw it under the broiler, he rolled his eyes and took my plate. When he brought it back it was still cold and instead of melting the cheese they removed it.. Message here.. If you complain "No cheese for you!" At this point my party had finished eating so I ate the cold $12 bagel.   Pointe in Thyme was a major bummer and very overpriced, I will not return nor recommend it to others.

Whitfill is a beautiful nursery. In addition to the huge variety of plants they also carry pots and garden decorations. They have some really cool birds that hang out and chew on wood. Sometimes I go just to walk around and enjoy the peaceful environment they have created. They also have a gift shop and a coke machine.  The employees are always friendly and helpful and they make up for the high prices. Either way I would still rather buy from Whitfill that WalMart or Home Depot.

Crappy Cleaners. I was very disappointed with the way my clothes came back. The shirt with pleats looked like they put it in the dryer, had to take it to a different place to get it done right .

Living in a new area I had to try out a new nail spot. I really enjoyed this place, I went in for a manicure/gel nails on a Friday evening. They were packed and I didn't have an appointment but they were still able to fit me in with no wait.   The owner did my nails, he was really nice and chatted with me the entire time. Start to finish with gel nails,  I was out in about 45 minutes.  I am really curious to see how long this polish lasts, but 4 days later they still look great!

Screw you and your new hibiscus tea. It's so delicious I now get Starbucks twice a day.   If that isn't bad enough you always have yummy little tasters, knowing I have no willpower and you will take even more of my money on my next visit.

Ok I admit it, I have a Starbucks addiction. I'm not proud of it, and it continues to get worse.  I'm a fiend for iced coffee with soymilk, I order them all year long. No fancy latte for me, I don't need the extra calories.  This Starbucks is rad and it is simply because of the cool employees that work it. I was recently hipped top the Rewards Program, and I have already earned enough points for free customization. No more paying for soy.. It really adds up when you buy 30 a month...   Thanks for the friendly tip that will bring this junkie back over and over.

I went to Desert Valley to get an Upper GI screen. I got lost on the way (dang google maps), I called and the receptionist gave me great directions.   The test itself is pretty gross, you have to drink Barium and roll around like a guinea pig while they xray your stomach. The nurse and the xray tech were both really nice and friendly and explained everything along the way.   If you find yourself in a situation where you have to get a GI screen, I would recommend Desert Valley. The staff was polite and professional and made me an uncomfortable experience almost pleasant.

Thank you Sonora Quest for  having online scheduling. I had to get blood drawn the other day and I went online and made a 2:30 appointment. I showed up at 2:25, and at 2:30 they called me back and drew my blood. I was in and out in about 10 minutes.   In previous years I have waited up to an hour, because you just had to stand in line and wait.  This new process is fantastic!

This Bashas is really annoying. Not much for selection and I have often bought expired items. The self check out stations have a goal in life to piss you off and waste your time.   Trying to buy a card? Put it on the scanner and wait, because obviously that card is a fruit of some sort.  In a hurry? 5 items won't scan and the helper is nowhere in sight.  Feel something dripping down your leg? That's right sucker, the soy milk you are about to purchase has a hole in it.   I go because it is the closest to the house and sometimes it is to dang hot to drive all the way to the blingy Fry's on Tatum.

I am a recent Food City convert. I used to only go when I needed hominy in bulk and couldn't find it in the grocery store. I now shop here on a much more regular basis for 2 reasons.   1. Cheap ass produce. Seriously 8 cucumbers for $1 and 3 pounds of roma tomatoes for $1. Ridiculous. I have a juicer so we use A LOT of produce and Food City has 80% cheaper produce than any other grocery stores in the state.   2. Cheap ass spices - I recently made Puerco pibil and needed Anchiote, I found it for $2 in a small bag. The only other store I found that carried it was charging over $12, no lie.   So I can't vouch for the rest of the store, but if you need spices or produce the is THE SPOT!

Not impressed and probably won't be back. I came for lunch and was immediately turned off by the lighting and décor. I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw "Ask server for bento box selection". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said "hmff that's weird".   None of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box.   There are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)

Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.  We ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny). A bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it.   The place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying.    To pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..  The food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much..

Family run and locally grown fruit barn yay! I love this place, I stop in about once a week on my way home from work. They always have great specials on fruit, steals actually. You can tell by the taste they are not pumped full of hormones and preservatives. Delicious. My favorite part, they are so friendly and greet you at the doors with a sample of fresh fruit (ever tried a blood orange?).  They also have fresh baked breads. They are so delicious it takes all the strength I have not to eat an entire loaf in one day. Favorites I have tried, cinnamon raison, banana and the lemon suck your fingers afterwards icing.. YUM! They also make sandwiches, $5 bucks including chips and a coke. This place is great, the staff is friendly and the fruit is fresh and delicious. Bring cash or a check though because they charge you $1 to use a debit card.

After reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews I was hesitant to post mine thinking I just had a bad experience. I decided to try my luck again and went to Ponchos for dinner last night. I now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible. First of the all the place used to be a house, now converted to a restaurant. Usually this is a great and charming idea, but it doesn't seem to work for me. The rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or (loudly) overhearing the table next to you. Imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom.. To close for comfort.  The food - I'm sorry my fellow yelpers but I honestly think it is horrible. The chips have always been to greasy, they only serve hot sauce and you have to pay for salsa. Lame. I have had many entrees (where's the pollo under all this fundido) (chimichanga greasemanga) but last night won the "most disgusting entree" award. I order the Steak Picado (I think that's what it was called) and it came out overcooked and cold. The rice and beans were barely edible, the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold (what appeared to be) sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak. It was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up..  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was even worse, the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time. They were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce. It was so bad he didn't even eat it. Don't get me wrong - I love Mexican, all types and usually the heavier the better, but Ponchos is a place I will not be returning. Yes it was really cheap, but you get what you pay for.. Picture attached.

I have been very impressed with Dr. Yocham and the entire staff at Southside Animal Hospital. My dog Lucy has a tendency to be very timid around new people and he has always done his best to make her feel comfortable and calm. He also is very affordable. It is a breath of fresh air to take a dog to a vet and not be reccommended expensive medications and multiple follow up visits.   When Lucy was exposed to Parvo I called a local vet who wanted $30 just to walk in the door and have a discussion with me, not satisfied with this I brought her to Dr. Yocham. He explained that since she was current on her vaccinations she was in no danger. He told me to monitor her behavior and explained all the sign to watch for. This visit was free of charge.   He won my trust on that visit and I have taken her back to him for all her vaccinations. They do not make appointments for visits so there can be quite a wait at times, but his caring and a dedication radiates in his work. I would reccomend him for any of your four legged family members.

South Mountain rules. I live on Central and Dobbins and can walk from my house down Central to the mountain. There are hundreds of trails from (I've been on them from 48th Street to 59th avenue) and the views are spectacular.  It can get a little packed ont he weekends, but not if you know where to go and stay off the main popular trails (Mormon and National)..

Located inside of Legend Cleaners is Kathy's Alteration's, this review is for her as I have never had my clothes laundered here.  I took a bride's maid dress, a cocktail dress and a few pair of pants to Kathy last week. I was immediately impressed that she had been in business for 27+ years and she knew exactly what she was doing.  She really went above and beyond when I asked her if there was any way she could fix the cocktail dress for me that day. Same day repairs are hard to do, but she was able to wave her magic wand and I picked the dress up later that day.  She did an excellent job with the bride's maid dress and both pairs of jeans. She works fast, knows her stuff and is very reasonably priced.  My only complaint is that she wanted to be paid in cash or check, they really should tell you that when you make the appointment.. Who still carries checks?

I've recently started a juice habit. I'm up to about 3 a day now and when I feel too lazy to clean my juicer at home, this is my go to spot. It is family run and owned and I really dig that. My favorite is the small mood enhancer, take that with a show of wheat germ and I am ready to start the day.   They have awesome looking salads and sandwiches that I have yet to try, but they are on my list. Updates to follow.

My boyfriend was addicted to this Einstein's before we met. He went here every day for almost two years, then I moved in and started making breakfast. We still frequent this location together when I don't feel like cooking.   I like this location for its large patio and people watching. The new bagel thins are pretty awesome, I get the breakfast sandwich with egg white, asparagus and cheese and it is tasty. Good bagels, consistently good service and friendly employees make this Einstein's stand out.

I wish I had never met Gainey. I wish I had never opened the glass doors and peeked my head in to the treasures that lay inside. I'm ruined for life, no other gym is ever going to compare. Mamma was right when she told me "You get whatchoo pay for" because the membership fees here are outrageous. I think I can justify the cost though... I should spend as much money on keeping myself healthy as I do on keeping myself intoxicated each month. Right?!  Alright, cost aside, here is why Gainey rocks the Health Spa - The equipment is fairly new and in great shape - The treadmills have individual Ipod docs and televisions and they actually work.  Locker Rooms - WOW! Awesome locker room, well stocked (deodorant, body spay, lotion, shampoo, shaving cream, razors ect) and very clean. There are individual showers and getting ready stations, there is a hot tub, steam room, sauna and an outdoor pool.  STEAM ROOM - You can sit in a large clean steam room and spray Eucalyptus.  Breathe in healing scent,  sweat out toxins and impurities, breathe in.....   Classes - Kick boxing, pilates, yoga ect... Although they do seem to fill up rather quick  I still haven't bitten the bullet and purchased a membership, but I think I may, it is worth is just for the steam room.

I will never forget the horrible experience I had here. It has been years since I visited this office and I still cringe every time I remember this experience. You know the story, routine breast exam leads to mammogram, unidentified mass leads to ultra sound ect.. I was sent here for a mammogram and an ultra sound. It was one of the most frightening experiences I have been through in my life. Basically they found a mass, and without knowing anything about it the Xray tech drew me a picture of how they were going to have to cut my breast open to remove the mass. No sympathy, no time for me to breathe through my sobs.   He acted as though he was in a hurry to get to lunch and would I please stop carrying on. I was barely 30 years old and being told I needed breast surgery, and that it could be cancer by someone who was not qualified to have that conversation with me. Again, not by an actual doctor but by a pompous little Xray prick.   Years later and I still think of driving back there and kicking him in the balls. Luckily the drugs I had to take back then have distorted my memory of that time so I can't really remember what he looks like.   Anyway do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. The people that work at this place couldn't give two shits about their patients.

I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of "Do not Return".    The beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame.

Applebee's is so gross. I really don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I had no choice, I was basically forced at gunpoint by co-workers. The tables were sticky, the service was slow and my food was served cold. I didn't even bother complaining because I expected it. Bleh. Don't order the tomato soup!

10 bucks for a large bowl including rice and a drink. Yes please! Pick your meat (dark and light chicken, pork, beef, cod), load up on veggies and then move to your starch. I loved that they had recipes for sauces for those that couldn't decide. My bowl was delicious, I went with the chefs special sauce and kicked it up with siracha. The soup was a beef broth and I heavily piled on the wontons. I couldn't finish my bowl but my leftovers were great.   The only reason this isn't 5 stars is they charge for take home containers and the hostess had an attitude. And if you don't have cash you are putting that 50 cents on your debit card... Not cool really. Still I would definitely be back as the food was good and the line moved quickly.

I have been wanting to try Lo-Lo's for a while now and let me tell you this place did not disappoint. There are so many great reviews I don't have much to add.   Here's what I loved: I saw Shaq walking out when I was coming in They serve Kool Aid and strong a$$ ice tea in mason jars The fried chicken must have crack in it - so juicy and delicious, you know it's bad for you but you keep coming back.. Just one more hit  Fried okra rocks Waffles are slightly sweet and cinnamony and who woulda thought to throw some fried chicken on top!  This is not the sort of joint to frequent if you care at all about your waistline, but when you want to indulge go to Lo-Lo's, get the fried chicken on a waffle and try not to go in to a coma before you leave.

I really was not very impressed with the quality of the food. The meat was very dry and the sauce they used to disguise it in was bland and greasy. Yea, yea I know it's mexican food so I should expect some grease, but a puddle of yellow oil surrounding the plate? Yuck. The only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa bar. The tomatillo and adobo salsas were excellent. Not good enough for me to return, but made the wait bearable.

I'm sitting here eating a reheated bean and cheese burrito (enchilada style) from Saturday. I usually eat  healthier lunches, but when it comes to Los Compadres my morals are easily compromised.  This location will always hold a special place in my heart. I love that they have not updated the dining rooms, and the 70's charm remains. This is a 5 star joint for me.   Really good Mexican food should have certain characteristics and Los has mastered all of them: The salsa is amazing, spicy, chunky and full of flavor.  They make killer guacamole, no tomatoes!  The cheese crisp are always well done. The carne asada marinade they use is fantastic. It has the perfect blend of spice, tang and citrus.   Just like Paula Dean they know everything but my waistline is better with butter.   No it is not healthy, but they don't claim to be. It is just pure, greasy, cheap Mexican goodness.

This place is awesome.   They have $2.75 (pay with cash in advance) drop off dry cleaning.   - Drop off by 9am and pick up same day by 4pm  - Friendly cashier that explained the process to me (I didn't really need that but it was a nice touch).  - Got my white blazer back and it still had a tiny little stain on it, but they attached a not stating they couldn't remove it without damaging the fabric. Also a nice touch so I know they tried, and it was not overlooked.   This is my new go to dry cleaner.

Pho-yuck this place!   I was tricked in to going here with promises of great Vietnamese. I was ready for a culinary adventure and what I got was a ride in the fright house.   The Bánh xèo was so greasy I couldn't eat it, it was literally served on a plate of grease.   The bun was about the same. It lacked flavor, the rice noodles were slimy, the spring roll was loaded with grease.   I ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass.  The service was horrible and I will not be back.

I had the misfortune of having and abnormal pap since then have recently spent a lot of time in this office. I cannot remember the actual doctor I was slated to see, but he was unavailable so I was given Shelley Cross the PA. I cannot sing her praises loud enough. She took a very scary experience and turned it in to a normal process to go through. She took so much time to explain everything to me, from the precancerous cells in my body to the actual procedure to remove them. Her attention to detail and kindness were amazing.  She followed up with me personally and called a few times to check on my recovery. I would recommend her to anyone. The entire staff in this office really helped to turn a not so pleasant experience in to something bearable.

I had a first-rate experience with this Banfield. I brought my puggle Ginger here  to have a mass removed from her gums. The doctor suggested that while she was under they clean her teeth and ears, which I opted for. She was done on time and sent home with some antibiotics. You can tell the doctor was highly skilled because she healed quite quickly and was on solid food the following day.   The staff called to check on her several times throughout her recovery. I was very happy with their service and would recommend them to others. Also I never felt I was being upsold, I was given choices and some I didn't want, they weren't pushy but more informative. I have insurance through them and although $40 a month is high, when Ginger needed surgery I was so thankful I had it. (Isn't that the point of insurance).

The place is small and the selection of books is miniscule at best. They are always out of most everything I am looking for. It stinks like old cigarettes and it is a hang-out for the homeless. (I can't really blame them though at least there is AC). They're closed Sundays and Mondays. There is a security guard patrolling.   One star because it is a library. One star because they have books. That is all.

After reading the Yelp reviews I decided to give Try Me a try for my bicycle tune up. They were not great and I wouldn't recommend them to others. I called on Saturday to ask how long a tune up took and they told me it could be same day if I dropped it off in the morning. I came in Sunday morning and was then told it wouldn't be ready until Tuesday, not a big deal, but also not what I was told on the phone.   The gentleman that took my bike in wasn't the friendliest; he seemed really busy and a little impatient. When I picked the bike up on Tuesday I took it for a spin and it was running great. My main complaint is that it was returned to me filthy, dusty and full of grease, they didn't wipe it down at all. The second complaint is that I had put on decorative air plugs on the tires and they were not put back on. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I got home.   Should I need a tune up in the future I would take my bike to a place who puts a bit more care in to their services.

Don't let her looks fool you Las Glorias is awesome! Sure she is located in a run-down strip mall but the food is delicious!  Piping hot chips are served with salsa and a yummy bean dip. Big, cheap margaritas and great specials on combo plates. I got the 2 burrito plate and had one left over for lunch the next day. The carne asada and pork are both excellent.  I have to remember Wednesday's - DOLLAR Tacos!!!!  The servers are friendly and the décor is tacky. This is a great Mexican place.

I had a wonderful experience at Nicks. I brought in two prints for framing and the customer service was top notch (as were the prices). I was immediately impressed when he discouraged me from putting a print in a frame I brought in because the borders would be off. I didn't notice it when I bought it, but he was 100% correct.  He also suggested a really cool mat for the print I did frame. He did it in store while I waited and the cost was great. I would recommend him to anyone needing frames from high dollar art to poster prints, Nick is the man.

Hats off to the entire staff at the Breast Care Center Southwest. I recently had to visit for a cancer scare and the great staff there really made my experience a lot less frightening that it could have been. It's the little things that count, they remembered my name, they offered me warm blankets when I was waiting topless on the bed for the doctor to arrive. Doctor Zannis was wonderful, he was extremely professional and was able to comfort and relax me at the same time. He really took the time out to explain the entire process to me (I had to undergo minor surgery to get a mass removed). He is a genius with the scalpel, I have a very small scar left from the incision. He has followed up many times with personal phone calls, just to check on how I am doing. I can't say enough about how wonderful him and his entire team has been. If you're ever unfortunate to have to go through this experience, choose Doctor Zannis. You'll be glad you did.

Getting ready to board to my pup this week I had to get her bordetella shots up to date. Being the cheap do-it-yourselfer that I am, I called around and found Ray's. They sell the shots and you can administer them yourself, saving you about $40 bucks at the vet.  The lady that assisted me was super friendly and explained the procedure of how to administer the injection. I paid under $8 and left educated.   The store sells all sorts of animal products, from horse feed to cat toys. If you are in the south side hood and in need of any sort of pet supplies be sure to check them out.

The return policy here is ridiculous. I bought a blower/vacuum for $89.99, I got it home and a couple weeks later attempted to use it. Hats off and high fives to you men that work these machines like pros. I couldn't seem to get the leaves to blow in a pile, I just blew them all over the place. I saved my receipt, and next time I went to Lowe's I tried to return it. No go. The policy states you can't return power equipment after 30 days. Even if it is in perfect condition (manual original packaging ect.) and you have the receipt. So now I am stuck with a blower/vacuum I spent over 90 bucks on and can't use. And the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending. I wanted to smash her in the face with the box. At least then I'd get some bang for the 90 bucks. Lucky for her I completed my anger management classes...

Grazie's has a cute interior, all the chairs are mismatched which gives it a nice homey ambiance. The patio outside also has a nice set up, but being the Phoenician that I am it was too cold to sit outside.    I went on Sunday around 2 and the place was completely dead. We inquired on the temperature of the wood fire oven and we were told they run it around 6-700 degrees. I love wood fired pizza and was excited to give theirs a try. We ordered the Margarita pizza, but that didn't seem to be what they brought out. What appeared on the table looked like a cheese crisp, with a leaf of basil in the middle. The crust was thin and soggy, the sauce was bland and the cheese poor quality and greasy. After eating half of a large I was still hungry. Perhaps this was an off day for them, the pictures (on yelp) of gorgeous bubbly crusts must mean they know how to do pizza right. I'd be willing to try them again, but the pizza was very disappointing.

The happy hour here is wonderful and it is all day/night during the summer.  The big ass burger is properly named and the drinks were strong. The only drawback is so many people are aware of the awesomeness of the place that it was jam packed. Every time I had been here I am amazed at the diversity of the patrons. From 21 - 90, every age range is represented.   Insider tip - Don't bring a bassinet and give sour faces to people next to you in a crowded bar. Yea lady, you know who you are.

People that go to places like Olive Garden and Buca, then complain about chain restaurants crack me up. It's like going to the DMV and expecting not to wait in line. You know what you're getting before you get there. Wise up.   Buca is fun for a chain. Their eggplant parm rocks, as does their cesar salad. Four stars because you get to walk through the kitchen when you come in and they bring a wine bottle with the menu, I love not having to wait for wine.   If you are looking for real home made Italian go to Giuseppe's. But if chain suits your fancy Buca is pretty cool.

You know when you get a really good cut and color.. When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say "Wow, you did a great job. It looks awesome".  Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.    It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldn't believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!

This is the best seafood joint in town. The happy hour is excellent (half priced oysters - hoooyaa!) The Lobster so fresh and delicious (for AZ). During dinner they have reasonably priced wines (which is nice when you're dropping 40 bucks on a lobster). It also rocks that the place seems so small from above and it is always cool to impress guests that it is underground.. especially in the summer. The only drawback is the dining area seating, it is really cramped, so don't go expecting romantic secluded tables. Other reviewers have noted the high price, but you get what you pay for and where are they finding all this cheap seafood anyways?

I wasn't a very big fan of Ruby Tuesday's, but I am still sad to see it closed, just another Mill Ave memory. The salad bar was sub par at best, but they did have decent turkey burgers. They had really cheap drinks for happy hour, but the atmosphere in the place was so crappy it wasn't worth chugging them down there. I'm surprised Ruby held on as long as she did on Mill.

Dear Ra  Your service completely sucks for lunch. If I go in when it is packed it takes me 1:20 + for lunch, if I go in when it is dead it takes me 1:20 + for lunch. The music is always blaring so loud I can barely hear my dining partners. This isn't a club, it is a restaurant at lunch time, set the vibe right... I really like the Salmon teriyaki bento box, but every time I order it the pot stickers are cold. Seriously EVERY TIME. Can you please make a few improvements?   I want to go back, you have a decent happy hour but fail miserably for lunch.  Sincerely, Sunny

Rollerz is a bit gross. You can tell the chicken they use is "mechanically separated" (has anyone but me ever wondered what that means..?) Whatever, it tastes like it has been in a can for 5 years or so... Or maybe like one of those packs you buy for camping.. The kind you just twist and they self heat... Weird. The wraps are sprayed with some oil blend and put in a panini press... I've had a few, but none were good. Their salads also taste plastic.. I had a tomato and it tasted like it came from a plastic bowl of fruit sitting on top of my grandmas table for the last 10 years.. Weird. The smoothies are also made with some weird powder and some kind of manufactured fruit. The place is always dead, I'm amazed they are still in business....As bad as this review is I still crave the buffalo chicken wrap on occasion.. Something is wrong with me.

Closed - Closed - Closed  Thanks Tempe Marketplace, you are seriously ruining Mill. This was a great store, they had wonderful housing accessories, cool furniture, and awesome art. It was a perfect place to buy a last minute gift and they always had great sales. I will miss this store :(

I have ate at this Pita Jugnle over 100 times. I love it, I loved it when it was a one room order at the counter spot and I love its expanded full blown restaurant. The food is great, my favorites.. Baba ganoush, hummos, lavash schwarma, caribbean salad and the glazed chicken pizza. The herbal (I think passion) ice tea is also great. I read through many of these reviews and I can honestly say I have never had bad service here, I even frequent the place during lunch when it is packed and still have good service.

Why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me?  Parking is freaking ridiculous, at least I have been enough times to know to leave my car on Mill and walk. Your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes? What kind of weapon or drugs can I be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels? Your sound SUCKS - seriously sucks. For all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already. The bathrooms are gross Drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars  (Watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze.. I've heard they are easy to run in to).

Mmmm I love this place. I've had Lalibela in my regular lunch rotation for years. The servers are great and they are quick to suggest dishes for new people. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the food is divine.   Some of my favorites:  Kye sega wat  - Beef cubes simmered in spicy sauce Misir wat  - Red lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs. Fosolia  - Lightly spiced string beans cooked with carrots and onion. Yebeg Alicha Sega Wat - Lamb cubes simmered in kibae, onion, turmeric and herbs. All this is servced with injera which is a spongy sour crepe, you use it to scoop the food off of the plate.   The spices for each dish are powerful and unique, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.   After writing this review I know what I am having for lunch today!

I hate this place. Seriously  hate this place. I have been coming here for 10 years and they still tell me restrooms are for customers. Never mind that I work at Chase, I'm wearing a badge and a collared shirt and purchasing an ice tea...I'm probably not a customer...I'm probably a crazy vagrant that is going to poop on the floor in the bathroom, yea I said  it, but it wasn't me....It must have been the last person they let use it.. A real customer. Disgusting..  The food here sucks. Their bagels are stale, their eggs are not from a chicken, I don't know where they are from.. Maybe a giraffe (ok the banana bread is good but that's it), their drinks are over priced. And even though the chick behind the counter looks like she is on crack, she must not be, because she certainly can muster the energy to wipe down the counter.  AND THE COFFEE SUCKS!

Monday - I sneak out of work, run down to Harlow's come back $8 bucks lighter and no one even knows I was gone.. Sunday - I roll out of bed drive to Harlow's and see all the devils I spent the night before with (hair as bad as mine). The service is fast, their breakfast are dependable, always good, always fresh. Great toast, great coffee, hot waitresses. AWESOME~

Excited to try the new DD I arrive and see a line out the door. Good sign I think.. As I wait in line for 12 minutes I come to realize it is not the fact that so many are here for the new revamped DD.. It is because of the kid working behind the register.. I finally get my turn and here goes:  Me - I'll take the # 5 with an ice coffee DD - Uhh I don't know if I can do that, it won't let me put ice in the register machine Me- Ok well can you ring it in as normal but make it iced instead of hot? DD - I guess but I could get in trouble ((Thoughts - From who the DD ice fairly? Gimme a break!)) Me - I won't tell  DD - We are out of the egg white scramble.. Me - Ok then #1 with an ice coffee Repeat conversation above. NO JOKE.  The sausage muffin thing was gross, the amount of sugar they added to my coffee immediately began to rot my teeth. Will not be going back.

I have worked on Mill for over a decade and Rula Bula has stood the test of time in my restaurant rotation. Last Friday I went for happy hour, and yesterday for lunch. Both expierinces were so pleasant I thought it high time to yelp it.   Happy hour was great. Our bartender was attentive and funny and made sure to come around before last call. They have some great apps on special, chicken fingers, skewers, potato skins ect.   Their lunch menu features weekly specials, so there is always some thing new and different to try. I went there with a group of 5 ladies and we everyone was happy with their choice. I had the grilled cheese on marble rye (with tomato and 4 types of cheese this sandwich is delicious), I have tried the boxtys, potato pies, bangers and mash, french dip and salmon - all great. Our dining experience was enjoyable last week mainly do to our server (Nathan?). He split our bill without being asked and had boxes and change before we finished eating. When you're on a lunch break, not having to wait around at the end of your meal is a big plus.   Rula Bula has a great outdoor patio, fun pub atmosphere, excellent Irish pub food and is located right off the Light Rail.  You can't go wrong.

Green has stepped it up. Went today for lunch and the food was delicious. Ordered the wings again, so spicy and wonderful, this time I went with the "meat"ball sandwich, the marinara was very good and the ratio of cheese to meatballs - perfect. Think Mama Mia's meatballs, great consistency.  I also really enjoyed the fruit cup it came with, it had pears.. Pears on a fruit cup are rare.  The beverage selection was also great, green tea freshly brewed and all sorts of green, organic sodas. I will be going back for lunch. (Even if I could make it in my own kitchen).

I used to love you.. Remember when I use to come visit every week and you would give me delicious tamales and huge heaping salads.. You were wonderful.. Why did you change? We had such a good thing going, we've been together 9 years!.. How could you have done this to me? Your recipes have changed with the new owner and I think the tamale sauce is from a can.. The last three times I've been in you were out of 2 salads (not good when you only serve 6 different kinds).. What has happened to you? I can't get over your dishonesty and lack of care for my taste buds. This is so depressing.. I'll never find anyone as good as you..used to be..

Rosita's is better than Macayo's (that's not saying much), less commercial and more traditional AZ mex.. It is decent, but they over-cheese everything. Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced, however the salsa is excellent. The menu is humongous and they cater which is nice when you forget it's mexican potluck day at work :) The service has always been fast, friendly and very attentive.  I'm knocking it down to 2 stars because on last two visits the sewer smell (remember that smell from Long Wong's..) permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite (which is not good when you are paying $8.95 for a freaking burrito).

If you are not past 70, or a yuppy hippy this store is not for you.   Completely overpriced, most sandals for women were over $100 and looked like something my granny donated to goodwill. They carry all sorts of birkenstockesque kinda shoes.  They boast "comfort" shoes, but who cares where you are walking when your feet look that ugly. I'll sacrifice a bit of comfort for a hot pair of wedges any day.

Let's see $4 bucks in my wallet and hungry for some lovely asada.. Not possible you say? Then you haven't been to El Pollo Fn Supremo. I love this place. I can smell the meat roasting from blocks away.. You can get 1/4 chicken (that you can rip into with your bare hands) or beef and they pile you up with fresh tortillas, great pinto beans, marinated onions and fresh salsa. You make your own burritos with all this delicious filling mmmmhhhhhhmmmmm.  Or you can fool your family into thinking you are a grill master and buy an entire chicken (point out how hot it was while whilst grilling when they are chomping down - major points). Seriously! It's so good. They only take cash so either hit the ATM or stand outside and spang for change.. The stoners going in to HQ are pretty vulnerable haha.

This chicken continues to be absolutely fantastic. Juicy chicken, crispy skin, excellent beans and marinated onions... Ahhh I love it all.   It's also nice that you only have two choices; beef or chicken. Somedays I don't want to waste my brain power deciding between 101 different items.   They still only take cash. And they are still my favorite quick lunch in Tempe.

Haji Babba is awesome. The food is good and very well priced, the falfel and the baklava are the best in town. Try it you'll love it. The dolmas, and gyros schwermas are excellent. The market is really cool too. They sells tons of flavors of hashish and beautifully designed hookas and at their prices you will never find yourself in paraphernalia or trails again. They also have excellent teas, boxed goods, dishes and all sorts of cool beauty products. It's a lot of  fun to walk around and look at everything while your waiting for your food.

Ok I typically make it a habit to not criticizing others reviews but I can't help myself here.   There are a few reviews who state it is expensive.. I don't consider $3 for a one topping slice pricey.. What cheapo world are these people living in? There are a few reviews who bash the ambiance. What are you looking for? It is an order at the counter pizza joint. And finally the reviews who complain the guy is rude.. He is from Boston and takes your order, he probably takes over 100 counter orders in an hour.. What do you want a hug?   I've been frequenting this place for over 10 years and I say 4 stars for what it is - Individual slices with tons of variety, great for when you're in a lunch rush or ending a booze fest.

Crappy chain resturaunt.. Crappy and annoying. Crappy souvlaki, crappy falafel that always hurts my tummy afterwards. Crappy music they torture me with. I'm amazed this place gets so many positive reviews. It must be from the same people that rate Olive Garden as authentic delicious Italian. Go opa yourself.

Every time I stepped foot in this store I felt as though I had entered Stephen King's "Needful Things". I just knew between all those books there would be an item I wanted more than anything else and would sacrifice everything to have. Luckily for me the store closed and I never had to kill anyone. I fondly miss the discounted and quirky book selection. This was a fun place to waste an hour or so..

The old house is a fitting name for this joint. A old house that has not seen a pest exterminator in years, an old house that still serves food from the yester years.. I've been here on many occasions and the food is always  fair to poor, the filet mignon is either a joke or from some other animal I have never heard of. The salads wilted, the croutons stale, the bread stale, even the smell in this place is stale. I hesitated before writing this review but 4 out of 5 visits were awful. I really (yes really) did see a roach on my last and final visit. The service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty. Go somewhere else for a steak, it's worth the extra few bucks.

This is one of my favorite places to have someone else pay for my dinner.  It's prety pricey for dinner but well worth it (especially if the company is paying). The food is wonderful and the menu changes frequently. The Ahi and the Asian Pear Salad are amazing, their quiches are delicious and every meat selection I have tried there has been well aged an cooked to perfection. They have a new happy hour menu consiting of Homemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup, Flatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella, Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil, Herb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey, Antipasto of Cerignola Olives, Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses and Thai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers. I've tried every on and they are all delicious! I tried going there for lunch yesterday and almost cried when I saw they are closed until August.. I'll have to wait a few more weeks........

"Why do I do it?" I sit here thinking to myself over and over... I know the food is horrible, I know the service is slow... "Why do I do it?" I know they always mess up my order and then over charge me. "Why do I do it?".. My Monday not being bad enough yet I decided to go to Uno's for lunch today. I hate this place, but it is directly across the street from my work so it'll usually do in a pinch..... NOT ANYMORE. Here are just a few reasons you should stay away:  Had to wait 40 minutes for the 10 minute lunch special Pizza arrived cold and chewy (I think I may have lost a filling) Never got my soup My friend ordered the spinach salad and by the time it came out the spinach was wilted from the hot chicken on top that had obviously been hanging out too long in the kitchen They charged us dinner prices for the lunch specials and then seemed confused when we pointed it out (Why would I order the Monday lunch special, but pay for the dinner portion...) We asked for change (for two twenties) so we could split the bill. The waiter looked at us like he had never heard of this practice... You mean just get change and not pay??...??  Genius.

My grams surprised me for lunch today. How sweet! She chose Uno's, I think they should change their name to Ohno's.   Had the chicken sandwich, bread was stale. Grams had the fish and chips and they never brought her ketchup or vinegar even though she asked 3 times.  Her friend ordered a deep dish and the bottom of the pizza was still doughy.  I don't think this place will ever get it right.

I'm really not a fan of this place an quite frankly I never have been. The entire ordering system is completely screwed up. You walk up and order and then you are supposed to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger, while people try to pass in front and back of you to get their food that is done before yours.  This is also the same place where the refills are so you have to maneuver around the condiment table and through the line to get a drink refill.   The condiment stand is a haven for germs. Last time I was in I saw a dude sneeze and then use his fingers to grab pickles. Geeerooos. I went pickle-less that visit.   The seats sucks and the tables are dirty and you wind up smelling like a campfire from all the smoke. No thanks.   And they only take cash!

I shed a tear the day the co-op closed. I had been going there for over ten years, I knew the staff, I was a member, I had worked in the garden and recycled my glass long before Tempe did it for me.  They carried Doctor Bronner's, Quorn, Big Sky soda and delicious tempeh sandwiches. They were the first place I turned when I was sick, bought my first netty pot there and learned of numerous home remedies from the helpful staff. I loved that place. No Whole Foods or Trader Joe's will ever com close to the unique and truly organic home grown experience that was the Co-op.

Café Boa you've lost me. I vow to never return (except for happy hour). I was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake. You're food has not changed yet every time I go in you jack up the prices and limit my options . I miss my old modest reliable Boa. This new Boa is arrogant and shameless. I went in today, and saw that now my ONLY lunch options are "30 Minute Meals". So choose soup or salad, choose 1 pasta or 1 sandwich and dessert and this does not include a drink.  All for the special price of $19.   I felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off. It wasn't even any choice of pasta/sandwich, it was Agnolotti Boa or Pastrami. And who do you know that eats dessert for lunch? NO ONE! This new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food.   Sure there are paninis under $10, but pair that with a salad (not a side salad you have to order a full portion for $9) and the prices make you ponder why you walked in the door.  Here's a tip - Go look at the menu at House of Tricks and put yourself in check, or perhaps talk to your manager/chef about coming to reality and getting back to your roots.

I took advantage of the groupon and took a party of 7 for lunch today. The menu online stated "CHOOSE ANY 2 ITEMS, COMBINATION OF SOUP, SALAD, PASTA FOR $9.95" Of course when we got there that was no longer on the menu. We were looking at $16 pastas once again.  Not one person in my group was pleased with their meal. I ordered the burger and it was burnt to a crisp as was the bun, my friend ordered the same burger medium and it was burnt on the outside and bloody in the center. I could actually take the burger and only use half of the bun the amount of meat was so small. The pasta salad it was served with was bland, the vegetable sandwich was the ass end of the veggies. All in all everything was less than acceptable.   I gave you another chance Boa, and while you boast of fresh quality ingredients you don't deliver on quality food or realistic prices. Sadly I won't be back.

Casey's is forgiving and she gets 5 stars. I've been going there for ten years and even though I have been kicked out multiple times.. (Using the blarney stone, using the mens restroom, generally causing a rukus).. They always let me back in. (Sometimes with a stern warning to behave..) Their food is decent and inside dining suitable for family. I truly love this place, she is like my home away from home.

I'm sorry Carmen's but you are getting a one star review.   I should have known as soon as I walked in this was not the sort of place to eat at. Should have just bellied up to the bar instead of ordering food, but we were starving. The eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried. There we were pools of grease on the plate that they tried to mask by covering it with sauce and cheese (nice try) but you still could taste the overused deep fried oil remnants.  The drinks were weak. Very weak.  The canoli had the same deep fried stale taste and it was filled with cream that resembled the consistency of toothpaste.  The meal was one of the worst I have had in ages. Hands down, I will not be returning.

The Mill and Baseline location is excellent. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable and portions generous.  Their veggie burro is excellent with big fresh chunks of avacodo, mm hmm. Their chips and salsa are also better than most casual taco shops. You can order ahead and pick up at the take out windows.

I used to like Amsterdam's when I was younger. There was usually a fun crowd, decent music and I would recommend it to my girlfriends as a great place to get our dance on during the weekends. The drinks were decently priced and poured,  and more often than not the bartenders were friendly.   Most of that seemed to have changed. I went in there for St. Patrick's day to meet some friends. The place was DEAD, there were about 8 of us in there until well after 10 and the music was awful. The real kicker though? I ordered a club soda which they used a single (low ball, small glass) to squirt some fountain club soda in to and then charged me 3 bucks.   I've never in my life been charged for club soda that comes out of a fountain. When I asked about it the bartender was pretty rude. And he really bad hair, like he had stuck his finger in a light socket.  Maybe they think they are in Snottsdale now? Maybe being decent to your customers is going out of style.. Whatever it is they won't be getting any more of my business.

I don't have much differnt than the other 200 reviews. The pizza is amazing, the antipasto always changes and the wait is horrible. Here is a good tip for a fun night out.   Go on a Wednesday, put your name on the list, then head over to the Art Museum (it is open till 9 on and FREE on Wednesdays). By the time you get back from the museum your table should be ready.

Free WiFi and the best coffee in town -what more can you ask for. How about awesome music, cool vibes and delicious food. I had an egg sammy the other day that was to die for.   Their pastries are wonderful, always fresh and delicious and the bartenders try and hip us to what mixology is all about.   From old school hippies to modern hipsters the people watching here can't be beat.   This is my favorite spot in Cen-Pho day or night to grab a drink and escape the heat.

Perhaps I had too high of expectations, but Tee Pee is no bueno. The only saving grace was the salsa, spicy and delicious. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with extra garnish. The plate i was given spent way too much time under the broiler and the garnish (roughly chopped lettuce) was was wilted by the time it got to the table. The enchilada sauce was pretty bland, the beans runny and an overall grease taste superseded any other flavors.   Aside from the food the booths are really uncomfortable. Maybe we should have sat in the restaurant area in stead of the bar, but looking around all the booths seemed about the same - lumpy lump. Meh.

Los Dos is not for the weak. If you can't take heat go to taco bell. If you want real authentic delicious mexican this is the spot.  The Adobado ribs are so good I want to rub them all over my body before eating them. The shrimp (probably the least spicy thing on the menu) is served in garlc butter and the portions are generous. The rellenos are delicious and the green sauce to die for. There can be quite a wait (up to 2 hours at some points) but grab a drink and have some chips on the patio, it is worth the wait. The sangria tastes like they murdered an entire hibiscus bush to make it, but is strangely very good. I would however stay away from the margaritas, they are pretty watery. They have a sign inside that says "Please control your kids". AWESOME! the last thing I want is a bunch of screaming brats running around while I am trying to enjoy a meal. Now for the complaints - the staff is incredibly rude and pretentious, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, the tables are too close together, the decor is gaudy and the food will burn a hole in your mouth going in and going out... well enough said. Even though the service is poor the experience and food are a must try for any Arizonian.

I am not impressed with the Mondrian at all. I have stayed here 4 or 5 times and each time left with a irritated feeling and an empty pocketbook.   The rooms are upwards of $300 bucks a night.. For that you would expect them to be decent... When you first glance in at the black and white interior you find it modern and sleek, pretty swanky. Upon further investigation you realize it is all a scam. They must have went to "Design on a Dime" for ideas, then left because they couldn't afford it. The "remodeling" from the James consists of sheets tacked to the walls and dangly things hot glued to the undersides of the counters, the bathrooms are a joke and I have almost broken the sliding doors (twice.... sober). Also the TV's are too big for the rooms so they must be watched at an odd angle.  The Skybar over looks the parking lot, how tacky (and hot) is that.  The pool is a pretentious joke. You should be a beauty queen or at least have an expensive rack.. The cabanas can be rented for $500 a day, for that you get a TV, misters and a couch. I have actually been here on a few occasions because friends have DJ'd and my friend is the bar manager (it always helps to choke down free drinks).. But if I was paying.... Last time my friend ordered a pitcher of Sangria. We knew it would be expensive but $75! They use little penguin wine that you can pick up for 5 bucks... I wasn't even able to get drunk enough to enjoy the underwater speakers.. Ostentatious jerks!

Zia rocks~! They always have the CD's I'm looking for and if they don't they will gladly order it. They buy my used CD's and do not scrutinize them with a huffy "my music taste is so much better than yours" attitude. Their rewards program is awesome, last time I was there I got $11.00 off my CD purchase. Woot woot! They also have a cool zine that can hip you to all the new music coming out and they list all the bands coming to the valley on their window in front. Nice!

Solid used music store. This location is my favorite. I shop here a few times a month and I can almost always find what I am looking for used. That rocks.   The people that work here are awesome, as they have been for the last 15 years. They keep getting younger, but they are always quick to help me find something, and don't up their noses at my weird taste in music. If I buy Foster the People, Atmosphere and Apparat on the same day I don't want any flack.   They also have a decent vinyl selection and will order stuff for you if you ask nicely.

I shed a few tears when I saw this location close. It has been my music staple store since the 90's (yes I am that old now). Good news though kiddos! They will be opening the doors again as a "Clearance Location" within a few weeks!!!

Delux is a great, they have won a gazillion awardsfor a reason. Their burgers amazing and their partnership with Niman Ranch makes for all natural veggie fed meats. They are open until 2am which is great for a lot of people who work in the service industry.   I've never tried the sushi as I always come for burgers but I heard it is pretty outstanding also. My favorite part about the food is they serve the fries in these cute little grocery  carts. It may be silly but I think it's pretty cool.

Excellent pizza and great wine list, they are not pretentious and I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.   Depending on where you sit the atmosphere can be cozy and romantic,  or lively for a night out with the girls.   The staff is friendly and most times I can find a seat at the bar.   4 cheers for Cibo!

I love Fez. They consistently prepare great dishes; I have been there about 20 times and never once had a bad meal. The wait staff is very friendly and they do a great job of remembering what you ordered last time you came in.  A few of my favorites, the super garlicky hummus with crisp pitas, the all american Fez burger, the spicy harrissa fries mmmm yum.  Last time I got to enjoy these with my dog on the patio, yes they are dog friendly which rocks. They also do a delicious brunch. The Fez frittata is great, as is their French toast, try going on a Sunday and it is half price bottles of champagne! Mimosa anyone?

I stopped in and ordered the stir fry bowl with noodle to go. I paid just under $12 and the bowl fed me 3 times. I loaded up on chicken and veggies (mushroom, onion, eggplant, celery, bell pepper, bean sprout, kale) and go the spicy ginger sauce.   I will definitely be back, the ingredients were fresh and it was woked in just a few minutes. The ambiance wasn't the best inside, but it will be in my regular rotation for pick up locations.

Sierra bonita rocks! I love their bacon wrapped shrimp (everything is better wrapped in bacon). Their green chili pozole is awesome and has just the right amount of heat. The buttermilk chicken is juicy tender and I have to hold myself back from licking the gravy off my plate. And their Sangria is awesome, not too sweet, perfect blend of wine and brandy..mMMMmmmmHmmm!

I don't get out to North Scottsdale often, but after visiting Bloom I may have to change that.  The place is well designed, big, open, gorgeous color scheme yet still classy and intimate.   Stopped in for lunch and had the pastrami on pretzel bread, with swiss and dijon mustard. That sandwich was divine. Pretzel bread is my new obsession and theirs was toasty and delicious.   I also tried the chopped salad, it was so incredibly fresh I didn't need dressing.   I am a huge fan of Fox Concepts, and I am happy to add this one to the list of recommendations.

Why oh why did it take me so long to discover Padre's?  Being a huge fan of modern Mexican cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food served at Padre's.  I found them to be in the same family as Dick's or Sierra Bonita, muy bueno!  The outside of the building is a bit deceiving and the parking is pretty tight. I wasn't quite prepared for what we stepped in to. Came on a Friday night and chose to sit in the dining area (my date tried to opt for the huge patio, but it was far to windy for that).  The band Cascabel was playing in the bar area, and the music and volume were the perfect enrichment to our dining pleasure.   We started with the jalapeno-bacon wrapped scallops and they were to die for. The bacon was cooked in jalapenos wich gave it just the right bite at the end. The scallops surrounded a pesto risotto and sat in a roasted red pepper cream sauce . The pesto risotto was not only delicious, but a delightful surprise at a "Mexican Restaurant".  For our meal we shared the modern cowboy steak, a 12oz. grilled rib eye, guajillo mashed potatoes, sauteed garlic spinach and again with the delicious roasted red pepper cream. I really loved the mashed potatoes, they were red from all the chili seasoning and absolutely perfect.   I washed all this down with a sangria and although it was a bit tart (tasted like they used a sweet and sour mixer) it was still decent.  The multiple rooms in the restaurant keep it intimate, while the bar area provides a more lively atmosphere.  The service was excellent, I can't wait to return for HH!

Padres you deserve another star! Every time I come in I have a great experience. The manager rocks. Like any restaurant you do not always get everything right, but the manager always takes care of it and makes it worth coming back. He gives personal attention to make sure each visit is memorable. Last time I was in  I ordered the sopa tarasca  black bean soup  with crema fresco and sides of diced tomato, bacon, queso and cilantro (see pics). It was delicious! I also tried the Tostadas de Tinga, the chipotle sauce and chicken combo was amazing.   I love the food, the service and the atmosphere. How could you get any better? Hip hop Sundays, that's how! There is no place I'd rather be than sitting on the patio sipping on a sangria and nodding my head to awesome tracks laid down by Tricky T.

I honestly cannot comprehend why anyone likes this place. The tiny bowl of chips they give you are almost as insulting as the tomato puree they call salsa.  Perhaps Sonoran stands for bland? That is the only way I can describe any item on the menu. Tasteless. They keep moving locations and I keep forgetting I don't like the food no matter where they put the restaurant.   Took my 80 year old grannie and she vowed never to return.

Baiz Market is a wonderful ethnic experience. I went in for lunch to satisfy my curiosity and was very impressed. The market portion of the store is huge, the produce area was well stocked as were their meats (you can buy an entire goat). I wandered through the isles for quite a while taking in all the exotic spices, they had not only Middle Eastern, but also African and Asian items. There was tons of tikka sauces, red pepper pastes, hummus and baba spreads. The bakery was awesome containing date and fig breads, 50 cent pita packs and little meat pies. They also carried hookahs, tons of shisha and every accessory you can think of to go with them.   After my shopping was finished I stopped at Al Hana, the little restaurant inside and had the beef schwarma (as recommended in several reviews). I am hoping it was just an off day, because the schwarma was very dry and grizzly and the pita it was served with was hard. I also ordered the baba ganoush and it was pretty tasty. I washed this down with a rose water (actually tastes just like it sounds but super sweet). All in all this was a great experience and I will definitely be back.

LGO is awesome. I've probably eaten here at least once a month for the last 5 years. My favorite time to go is during breakfast, something about the insanely busy store/restaurant and incredibly confused people make me feel right at home.  I love the croque madame, it is an open faced sammy with ham, tomato, spicy mustard, and an egg topped with gruyere and broiled to perfection. The lemon ricotta hotcakes are also really good as are the chilaquiles. The coffee is some of the best in arcadia, and I always buy a bag of beans (Mr. Espresso) to take home. I also purchase a cold coffee press here and I use it almost every day.   Lunch and dinner usually lack the frenzy of people and can be a bit more relaxed. The pizza is great and the wait is never very long.   The food is fresh, the employees are nice and it is great for people watching. Sit outside and soak in the gorgeous weather we are sure to have for at least 2 more months!

I had no idea Acacia cafe would be so delicious. I have been here for breakfast quite a few times now, and each time I am pleasantly surprised. The food is high quality for low cost (almost diner) prices.    A few of my favorites:  Awesome waffles cooked to perfection and covered in fresh ripe fruit. The veggie omelet (try the roasted vegetable mix), the hash browns its served with are always crisp and not greasy. The vegetable sandwich with cheddar cheese  In addition to the food, the beverages are also great. They have three types of fresh brewed tea (the passion fruit is my favorite) and their cappuccinos and coffees are excellent also. The staff is friendly and quick to help you make up your mind, and it has always been very clean and well organized. This is a must try for a quick breakfast, I can't wait to go back for lunch and try the chicken salad everyone is raving about.

Awesome coffee, I got an iced coffee and it was pretty delicious. It was strong but very low in acidity, which is always the way I prefer an iced coffee. I also ordered the veggie frittata and took it to go. I was really impressed with the frittata, it was light and fluffy and the veggies were crisp even after I reheated it.   I try to support local whenever I can and I am really happy my friend suggested this place instead of Starbucks. Fast and Fresh and Free Wi Fi!

PF Chang's is average food with sodium levels to kill a horse. That being said I still eat here about once a month because it is the closest restaurant within walking distance to my work.   This is the 3rd time I have ordered online and every time the order is incorrect. Today for example, I ordered the double pan fried noodles with shrimp, ONLY SHRIMP, what I received was beef, chicken and shrimp. I walk to Chang's and back to work so walking all the way back to complain is a major inconvenience.  3rd time is the charm. I won't be back. _________________________________________________________ Update to original review. I called and let the manager know what happened and he not only offered to make me a new dish immediately, but he had someone run it over to my work. That type of Customer Service is outstanding and they will continue to get my business, especially when I feel a salt craving coming on.

Perhaps one of my favorite brunch spots on the planet. The place is small weith only 4 tables and a bar. It is also dark and can get pretty loud, but "sitting by all your friends" loud not "talking in a movie" loud.   They cook over an open flame wood fired grill right in front of the bar. The interior is copper and dark wood which exudes a warm comfortable feeling. The service is always awesome and they remember the regulars and treat you like family. They also have a private dining room that you can reserve for parties. There is a loft in the room which is pretty cool if you're dumb enough to climb up there when you're drunk (wasn't me).  Now for the food (insert drum roll) the finest New Mexican Cuisine in the valley. Things you must try before you die:  Shrimp quesadilla served with roasted red peeper dipping sauce, carne adovada, try not to orgasm while shoveling it in to your mouth. The chili relleno (choice of turkey, pork or beef).. Everything comes slathered in red or green sauce that makes you want to cry while eating for fear of being done. And get the posole sometime, you'll never love another. This is just for brunch, their dinner menu includes fresh fish, grilled steak and on and on and on... I'm getting hungry just thinking of it.

Dick's I love you.   Came here for breakfast on Sunday, you were crowded so your server took me over to Richardson's. I had the omlette (which I've never tried before). It was the best damn omlette I have ever had. Shrimp, peppers and pepper jack cheese.   Thanks for ruling the valley with your fine cuisine!

Best breakfast in town. Carne Adovada is amazing, I could live off of the green chili potato, the rellenos are still my favorite.. Big, fat and strong mimosas (you know how a mimosa should be). You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   I recently tried the posole and bought another bowl to take home.   It's just that good!

Went to the Vig for after dinner drinks the other night and I had a really good time. We stopped in probably around 9:00 and were given a booth immediately. I was thrilled to see we were hitting happy hour so all the martinis were $5 a piece (awesome). Now I have not had the food here but the atmosphere was great. There was a nice mellow DJ accompanied by a trombone player and it really set a nice vibe. The couches out on the patio were spacious and comfy and I could picture myself spending a few relaxing evenings here with friends when the weather gets cooler. Granted it is a slight cheesy atmosphere with the cougars and all but what bars aren't (and I would prefer watching cougars than drunk college jocks any day). The drinks were cheap the music was great. People complain about the valet, but you can park across the street and save yourself the $5 bucks. I think I'll check it out for dinner tonight the wings and burger seem to get great reviews.

No. Just, no.   We went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it.

Located in a strip mall center, a small place that has a long, dark bar and a few tables lining the walls. The Pasty may not look like much but that is because all the effort is spent preparing the delicious pockets of heaven. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the pasties right in front of you using all fresh ingredients. A few of my favorites are the bangers and mash served with red wine gravy and the carne adovada served with salsa and sour cream. They have just as many vegetarian options and use the brand Quorn which is great, I have had quite a few of their veggie patsies and they are all delicious. This place is small so not recommended for big groups and if you go during lunch expect a wait - and trust me the wait is worth it!

This place is great . You order at the counter and they bring your food out. There is a nice big dining area and seating is almost always available.   I have had the Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata for breakfast and they are generous with the brie, I've also tried the Banana Walnut Pancakes that were delicious. For lunch their Grilled Cheese and BLT rock. Dinner I have tried all the pasta but the Butternut Squash Ravioli (butternut squash ravioli topped with roasted walnut cream sauce and nutmeg) is my favorite. They also have excellent ice tea and lemonaid and tons of pastries and sweets.  This is a great place to go for a quick, fresh, sit down meal.

Went for happy hour the other day. $3 margaritas, $5 apps and all are delicious. Had the flautas and they were wonderful, shredded beef simmered for hours, so tneder and juicy, then stuffed into a tortilla and covered in a red smoky sauce...Two girls, 2 margaritas and flautas - 20 bucks, now that is happy hour!

Feeney's is a great old school neighborhood restaurant. They have awesome specials ($4 Burgers on Mondays, $10 bottles of wine) and the food and ingredients are always good quality.  Last time I was there I had the baby back ribs and they were delicious. Fall off the bone, incredibly moist and the sauce was tangy and yummy.  I love the salad bar, it has canned beets as an option and I think that rocks. It also has garbanzo beans and potato salad.. Yum!   The service is great and they make you feel like family. I'll definitely be back.

What can I say? This place rocks!  Yasu knows his fish and truly took my dinner party on a flavor adventure.  The restaurant seats under 50, so the atmosphere is very cozy and warm. We took our seats and prepared our palettes for the freshest and most savory fish I have tasted in Arizona.   I don't know where to begin... I'll highlight my favorites  Bacon wrapped scallops, cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy and they achieved this without overcooking the scallops.   Red snapper carpaccio pounded paper thin - yum, melted in my mouth  Red miso eggplant (This eggplant has a much thinner skin, a more delicate flavor, and very little seeds that tend to make other American eggplants bitter) this dish was amazing, so full of flavor (It was even a hit with my little sis who normally hates eggplant).  Garlic miso clams - Our server suggested picking them up like cups and slurping the clams out so you get the full experience and do not miss any of the miso. Excellent idea.  Wagyu sashimi (Kobe beef comes from a breed of cattle called Wagyu, learned this that evening). It was served with a sliver of fried garlic and a wonderful dipping sauce, but I didn't use it because the quality of the meat was so that I did not want to cover up the flavor.  Kampachi (This yellowtail must be extremely high in fat, it tasted like butter. (I didn't want to share).  We ended the meal with Foie gras sushi and a chilled tiny Peach.  I had to give my taste buds a moment to recover from the Foie gras, just let that flavor marinate my taste buds... Wow!  This meal was excellent and our server was well educated. He recommended options we would not have been so bold to try without his prompting.  Hats off to Yasu and team, this place is culinary expertise at it's best.

I stumbled upon this place on my way to Dicks Hideaway.. The sign outside, located just off 7th St. and Bethany Home drew me in.. I love Latin food and they do not let you down. I have since been there 3 times and overall my dining experience has been good. The place is hidden and only has about 10 tables inside the restaurant and there are a few patio tables also.  The on my first visit I had the tropical shrimp martini for an app, then went with the special - a crab stuffed chili relleno. It was so good I was disappointed the second visit when it was no longer a feature.. I've also tried the tilapia and it was equally good. And their sangria is wonderful, I could drink a gallon, but it is pretty strong so maybe that is not the best idea :) The only drawbacks?  On my third visits I sat on the patio, there is a dance studio next door and they play their music very loud while practicing routines. We had to listen to the same chorus line thought the entire meal, I think that song has been permanently engraved in my brain, and it was not a good song. Another disappointing thing was the pernil asado, I am big pork fan but what they served was a big, greasy and fatty mess, I will not try that entree again.   Overall the food is pretty delicious and the place has a great ambience (if you are not sitting outside during dance class). You feel so cool discovering such a hidden and quaint spot you want to tell everyone about it.

Thank you Fuego for continuing to serve outstanding food! I came for dinner on Saturday and had the short rib and I ate myself in to a coma.   The food is fantastic, the service is stellar and the patio is bustling and cozy now that the weather is cooling down.   I continue to recommend this place to friends and family and I am always glad I did.

Sun Asian Kitchen.. Mm Sounds good, like the name. What does this place have going for it? Location, that is if you live in South Phoenix.. Great happy hour specials on food and booze   - $3 for 6 fat crab puffs, can't go wrong! Unfortunately the food is only 1 step up from fast food, the decor is pretty cheesy and there are 3 TV's that they like to play at full volume on different channels.. And do you really want to watch Animal Planet's Gross out show while you are eating? Really? But if your in the mood and don't feel like driving far it is decent enough. the staff is so attentive and they speak really really really fast..

Sun Asian has won me over! The happy hour runs from 3-7pm and is a smoking good deal. $1 eggrolls, sushi and sashimi, and all other sorts of items all under $5. I love the fired tofu, the beef skewers, the spring rolls and the crab puffs.   They have Kirin Light and sake and wait staff is incredibly friendly. If I lived in the area I would find myself here more often.

I really like the fact that this is a straight piercing joint. They don't try to mix tattoo's in like so many other places. The people that work there are very professional (Ok so my grandma would cross the street if one was walking towards her... but don't judge a book by it's cover gramma). The jewelry selection is awesome and they keep books of pictures so you can see what all sorts of freaky deeky piercings look like. I've been pierced and stretched and both were very pleasant experiences.

A few weeks ago a friend and I were discussing the drive in and admitting to each other we hadn't been since high school. Hi on nostalgia we decided to go see Forgetting Sarah Marshall at the Scottsdale Six.   I have to admit I was pretty excited when I was packing wine, bruchetta and kettle corn to take to the movies. I was also excited to hear the cover was only $6 a person. That cheap and you can bring your own food and booze? I was ecstatic.  That excitement lasted all the way to us pulling up to the booth to pay our way in and discovering it is a cash only Theatre. No worries, they have an ATM inside so we park the jeep, go inside and pull out cash - so now our $6 cover just went to $10 with the ATM fees. We're still feeling pretty good (although a little irritated that it wasn't posted anywhere they don't take debit).  We found a spot and much to our dismay were surrounded by screaming kids twirling around glow sticks on strings. We looked everywhere but there was no "adult" zone.. Still no worries, I'm sure once the movie start their parents will control them right? WRONG. Those kids ran around like banshees the entire movie.   What could be worse? Let me continue. All through the movie people were still driving around and around looking for a spot and covering everyone else in dust. We had another couple pull in next to us, very close to us (although there was spots everywhere). We looked over and saw they had no children so we thought we were in the clear - WRONG. They pulled out cigars and smoked them the entire movie.   At this point after drinking half a bottle of wine, and inhaling smoke for most of the night I headed of to the bathroom. WOW disgusting, I had seen cleaner and better smelling bathrooms at truck stops - seriously atrocious!  So here's my review - The idea of still having a drive in is pretty cool, the overall experience leaves much to be desired.

Happy Hour review:  I was skimming through Christine O's review and elated to see "happy hour every day from 4pm-6pm and reverse happy hour from 9pm-close....all appetizers are half off and mojitos, house chardonnay/cabernet, and all beers on tap are only $3"  Thinking to myself that it sounded great and the rest of the reviews were awesome I decided to try it out this weekend. The plan was to meet my girlfriend there about 4:00, but after traffic from the game and the roads being tore up from the light rail we arrived about 5:15.. Parking was ok but finding the actual restaurant was a little confusing, point being if you've never been here before allow yourself some extra time.. The appetizers were excellent, they normally range from $8-$27, and at 50% off you can't beat the price so we indulged. We tried the teriyaki tenderloin (served with ginger and rice), the blue cheese and bacon chips that was drizzled in chipotle cream sauce and the scallop lollipops. The portions were generous and I can't wait to go back and try the calamari and the artichoke crab dip. Wash that down with $3 mojitos and you have yourself a very happy -  happy hour!

If you want a cheap, crappy nail job go to Van's. Complain all you want. It can hurt from to much filing, they can leave bubbles in your nails, and they can file them square when you want them round.. What can you do about it? Nothing.. Unless you speak their language, which I unfortunately did not. (Yes I'm another dumb American).  There are thousands of jobs that do not require one to speak English, but I do not feel this is one of them. Communication is key in the service industry. They seriously brought tears to my eyes 3 times and my nails looked horrible. I will not return.

Thoroughly enjoyed the Valley Ho! Tori B. had a post reception and stayed here after her wedding. We drank in the bar until closing and the bartenders were awesome, quick to take orders and very friendly.   I love the open layout of the bar/dining/patio area. We had breakfast here the next morning and the sunlight pouring in the dining area really set the mood for a sunny and beautiful day.   The food was good. I ordered the bowl of berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, raspberries, strawberries) and it was fresh and delicious. I was disappointed in the Croque Madame I ordered, I've had it several places (it is delicious at LGO) and it is one of my favorites. This one was not so good because it was COVERED in béchamel sauce and tasted like stale flour. Not their fault though, it stated it on the menu I just hadn't read it when ordering.  The rooms at the hotel are very spacious; I was impressed over the size of the bathrooms. The décor is very funky and the glass walls opening on to the balconies created the illusion of a lot of space. The complimentary breakfast bar included espresso and the soap and lotions (Red Flower) smelled like organic heaven.  The pool area has great cabanas and the atmosphere was different than many Scottsdale Hotels. There were a bunch of families and 20 somethings, but there weren't a lot of fake boobs/tans ect..   The Valley Ho provided a wonderful spot for a greet weekend. I may have to crash it again as the hot weather approaches.

Why did I love this place so much? + Free softserve icecream + Loads of organic produce and bread + No high fructose corn syrup (unless you get a soda) + Excellent spicey tortilla soup + Quick, healthy and delicious + My bf got the potatoe and I couldn't believe the monster! It was 4 lbs!  It sounds like this place has improved since earlier reviews. I would go back anytime for lunch, it was great. And kids eat free on Sunday's (so avoid it like the plauge and go another day ;)

Brew and View!!!!! Such an awesome concept. There is not much better on a hot summer's day than an ice cold movie theatre and a frosty beer. Now that the Esplanade has both you can be sure to find me here on a weekly basis.   I got a 23oz stella for $7 bucks so I was quite impressed that they did not jack up the prices. They also sell all sorts of burgers, sandwiches, wraps ect.. I haven't actually tried the food so updates to follow.  Insider Tip - Theatres 1-5 are the ones with the reclining chairs, the rest only rock... But rocking with a frosty beverage is A-OK. Bring a sweater, it gets really cold inside!

Took Lucy and Ginger here Saturday morning and they had a great time. There are two sections, a small section for dogs 25 pounds and under and a separate section for larger dogs.  In comparison to other dog parks I found this one quite nice. The grass was green, no ants, plenty of shade trees and seating for owners. There were water fountains fand toys for large and small dogs.   The people were really friendly and maintained control of their dogs and cleaned up after them.   I haven't been at night so I can't speak to the lighting but the daytime experience was great and we will definitely be back.

Wahsun is some dang good Chinese mang. I agree with the other reviewers, these are the best eggrolls I have ever had. They alone could make a meal, I think they are about a half pound each and full of white meat chicken. I also tried the noodles and the beef broccoli, all of it was delicious. The prices were super cheap for the hefty portions they provide. We ordered to go and were happily surprised when we got home and saw a few free eggrolls thrown in with our order. Don't judge this place by the interior, it is not a fancy joint but the home made food is solid.   Tips: BRING CASH - no cards accepted CALL BEFORE - it took me 3 separate times of calling this place to see that they were closed. They don't stick to the hours posted and they don't have an answering machine. If no one answers when you call assume they are closed.

I've always loved Dos Gringos, from the old one I would frequent in Tempe to this location we pre-game at during kickball season. They have big open patios perfect for sipping on Coronas and they've got decent Bloody Mary bars on Sundays.   The Carne tacos are cheap and delicious, and they have crazy specials during games. This is a great place for groups or lazy day drinking.

Not having been to a club in quite a while (and especially not in the industrial area of Tempe) I was a bit skeptical about going to Phase 54. My roommates band was playing and I had promised I would go, so I headed up there on Saturday night.   I have to agree with Amber W.  - The place is utter chaos and not in a good way. To enter the club you walk upstairs and through an outdoor patio. There was a hard core techno DJ spinning outside and girls dancing on the bar that would have looked better with more clothing on.. As soon as you walk inside there is a band playing in the corner of the upstairs area, there is a small bar and a deathtrap spiral staircase to go downstairs. Seriously this thing is dangerous, I was sober and had a hard time walking down it.. The main problem with the upstairs area is that you can hear both the band and the DJ at the same time, the sound system is horrible. Same to be said for downstairs, there was a metal band playing and you could still hear the band from upstairs.. How is this enjoyable? It was a really interesting crowd, the metal heads, the hardcore kids and the emos, then the older folks that came to listen to the folk/jazz band.. Weird...  The bartender must have kept confusing water for vodka because he poured the weakest drinks I have had in a while (seriously 4 vodka sodas later and no buzz), then he overcharged (2 drinks I hadn't ordered). By that time though I was so eager to get out of there I didn't care. 2 stars for visual stimulation - I saw a granny with a cane, and a kid with foot high rainbow mohawk standing by each other. That rocks.

This place is great, someone helps you guide your car on to the roller which is usually the hardest part for me in the auto washes.   There is something fun about sitting in your car while it goes through the wash, I have loved it since I was a kid.   You can get a $3 wash and free vacuums, I now use this about twice a week!~

We had a member of the Light Rail come to my work to talk about it the other day. It is going to open 12/29 this year and I can't wait! I will be able to jump on a bus from South Phoenix, get on the Light Rail downtown and get dropped off in Tempe at Mill and 3rd. All this and pay less than $50 bucks a month for both bus and rail fair. After spending the last week taking the Bart in SF I am looking forward to the Light Rail even more.. It'll cut down on pollution, lessen traffic and finally start to get AZ caught up with the rest of the world's big cities. It's about time.

Today one of my dreams came true. Being a Phoenix native I eagerly awaited the opening of the Metro for many, many years. It is finally here and I rode it to work today. Halleluiah to reducing my carbon footprint. I took a bus from Central and Dobbins to the Main Station at 1st and Van Buren where I caught the Metro, then I got dropped off on 3rd and Mill and walked to work. Total trip time was 1 hour 10 minutes. Granted it only takes me about half that time to drive, but taking the Metro just makes you feel good. That and you can people watch, read a book whatever. I was really impressed about how clean the Metro was, and it wasn't crowded at all, probably only 60% full.   Phoenix is growing up. Hopefull people will use the Metroenough where it can afford to stay open for later hours..

I was pretty impressed with this place. Their customer service was excellent. They greeted me and my girlfriend right away and put us in chairs with hot suds and gave us ice cold water while we waited for them to finish the people before us. They hand you a price sheet, which is really nice when they don't speak English, you pick your service and there are no surprises at the end. We both got mani-pedis, for $28 bucks, pretty good price. The best part was they didn't hurt me! I hate when you get a ped and they attack your cuticles or try to slough off your alive skin cells from your feet. I would recommend this place to anyone. They don't have the best selection of colors though so if you want something special bring your own.

I was referred to Tate by a friend who described him as honest and fair. I got on Yelp and could barely believe my eyes.. All 5 star reviews? Is this possible?  I thought I needed new brakes so I took my Honda to Tate. I was amazed when he called and told me all I needed was a cleaning. For the first time in my life someone told me that an auto repair is going to cost far less than I had anticipated.  WOW. In addition to cleaning my brakes he gave me a health break down of my car, letting me know what to look out for, what needed fixed and what could wait a while.   This type of customer service has forever changed my mind about auto repair shops. I am now a customer for life, and will never take my car anywhere else as long as I reside in Arizona.   The 5 star reviews are well deserved. Tate is awesome!

I have had the opposite experience of the other reviewer. I find the employees to be very helpful and always friendly and fun. They have a decent wine selection and they are open to ordering just about anything you ask for.   Having a drive through window makes this a 4 star joint to get your booze from!

I ordered a customized birthday cake and called the day before to talk about it with the decorator. I was assured there was no issue and she would see me the next day. The next day I stop by on my way to the party and there is no cake. I couldn't believe it! I had just talked to the woman the day before.   The lady working the bakery that night described herself as "computer phobic", so she wouldn't be able to look up my order. She called the manager, in the interim she preceded to tell me that the frosting I ordered was nasty and gets all over everything.   Seriously! It's for a 40 year old not a bunch of toddlers.   The manager came, apologized and I got free cake out of the deal. Obviously not decorated or inscribed but it was better than showing up empty handed to my party.  Think twice before ordering a cake here.

I absolutely despise this Target. Every single time I go in there they are out of stock on half of the items I need. Last time I was looking for something specific (over the door mirror), I looked on line and it said they were in stock, I called the store, they then confirmed they were in stock. I get to the store (I live 5 minutes away) ... Yep not one in stock.  Another experience went like this.. Bought $300 worth of crap, get home and the dog food containers I purchased (which says so on my receipt) are not there. I call and they ask me to  recall what register I was at. Is this on the receipt? No. How the hell am I supposed to remember... They  then tell me they will look around and if they see them I can come back and get them. No one ever called... When I called back they told me to come in. When I went in the manager argued with me "Are you sure" blah blah... It took 2 calls and 3 hours of my time to get the 2 dog food containers I paid $8 bucks each for.   I'm glad others are having better experiences here, but for me this Target sucks.

This Fry's is so awful I would give it negative stars. The only thing that sucks worse than their produce section is their alcohol selection. I think they carry a total of 5 wines that cost more then 8 bucks. It always smells like rotten meat, the parking lot is sketchy and there is a cop guarding at the entrance. What does that tell you? The isles are very narrow and always full of people that are too stoned to make a decision on what type of crappy junk food they want.   There are never enough cashiers but be wary of the self checkout. It is always slow because people do not understand YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE SELF CHECKUT IF YOU HAVE A FULL CART! (Sorry major pet peeve). And for some reason the cashier seems to disappear anytime I need assistance.   If you are in need of groceries, drive a few miles down Baseline and hit the one on 24th street. Either that or pack some heat and plug your nose.

I have died and gone to grocery heaven. This Fry's is unlike any I have seen in Arizona. It is chic  and humongous, but it is also well laid out and sectioned off. You could spend all day in many of the different departments or just run in and pick up a few groceries.   Starbucks Smoothie Bar Olive station Beautiful floral department Outdoor Garden Center Sushi Station Wine Bar Lounge Awesome produce section Jewelers and chocolate stations Tortilleria Gourmet everything you can image if you want to spend a little more (meat, seafood, cheese, vegetables, fruit).. And on and on  Covered parking Car Wash  Vallet Loading Assistance   And on my last trip I even saw the Easter Bunny. Completely awesome!

When Georgie S. suggested the Tavern for lunch I was pretty skeptical. Bar food? Hmmm... I was impressed immediately when we walked in, the place was packed. All these people must come here for a reason right? Much to my delight it was Taco Tuesday! That's right, any taco on the menu for 2 bucks. I ordered the mahi mahi and the carnitas. They were both excellent; the carnitas had a nice smoky flavor. I left lunch 7 bucks lighter (cheap cheap)!   I'm not usually a fan of sport bars but I will definitely be back for lunch.

Hobe employs excellent butchers. I have been buying my meat here for years and this shop keeps getting better. I often buy the packages because they have some really great deals. Some of my favorites are the Ribeye, Tri tip, Sirloin, Butterfly Porkchops, Chicken Breast, and of course the Applewood Smoked Thick Cut Bacon! They will give you cooking advise and recipe tips if you are in need.   They don't just stop at meat though, you can get  wonderful BBQ Sauce, pre-made Twice Baked Potatoes, Sweet Corn (in season) and all sorts of Marinades.  They also carry raw pet food and great doggie bones.  The Saturday special is not only a great deal, but some of the best BBQ in Phoenix.

Discount Tire has always been pretty good to me.   I am usually in and out in just over an hour.. They keep my car history and they are honest about my tires.   They don't try to upsell me and they have good magazines in the waiting area. If they had wifi I would give them 5 stars.

I have been seeing Dr. Kim Lucas for over ten years now and am happy to yelp off on her excellent service. The entire staff is friendly, helpful and extremely thorough when it comes to diagnosing illness or recommending treatment. She employs all women which helps to create a more comfortable atmosphere when getting the dreaded yearly "well woman" checks. I have seen her and her nurses for numerous illnesses over the years and they are patient and understanding and quick to discuss options other than medication. It is really wonderful when they talk to you about your diet and/or herbal supplements rather than just prescribing meds. Taking a holistic approach to the overall wellness seems to be the primary focus. Whenever I leave the office I not only feel better, but more educated about my body. I would recommend her and her team to anyone.

I have to agree with Rand H., this Carolina's is far superior to the one at 12th St. & Mojave.  It's well kept inside and most times that I have visited this location it is pretty clean. I have been there times when there are dirty tables, but when the line of people ordering never stops you have to go easy on them.   Either  way the food is worth the wait. The machaca tacos are my favorite along with the standard bean and cheese burritos. I love that you can load up on as much salsa as you want.  The breakfast burritos are great (try the four way: egg, potato, bean, cheese).   It is cheap and fast (even with said lines) and the tortillas rock. I always buy a dozen to take home and them heat them in a skillet before serving. YUM!

I've heard a lot of buzz about St. Francis and was eager to try it because I am always on the lookout for new restaurants in CenPho. I was not disappointed. This restaurant design and layout is as fantastic as the food and service.   The Spot:  Located on 1st and Camelback this gorgeous building boasts original brick walls and polished concrete floors downstairs. I had inquired about the upstairs and my server let me sneak a peak, the floor upstairs is made of cork, very unique and gorgeous. The contemporary design really stands out. There is a support system of cable and pin settings, which do away with support columns (so said my dining partner), and it creates a very open and airy flow.  The women's restroom has an original safe built in to the wall with the handle acting as a toilet paper roll. The bar opens to both the restaurant and the patio so giving diners a sense of comfort. There are also pop out windows, so you are able to see in to the kitchen from almost any spot. Currently only the downstairs is open, with plans to open the upstairs within a few months. (The upstairs would be a great place to have a big birthday dinner, seating about 40). The patio wraps around the restaurant and will provide additional seating once the weather cools off a bit.  The Chef: Aaron Chamberlin was part of the opening team for some of my favorite restaurants in the valley: Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO and Radio Milano. He has over 20 years of experience and his French/Mediterranean training helps him to create phenomenal dishes, with top quality ingredients. The kitchen has a brick chamber used for roasting meats, vegetables and breads. The oven and selected spices really brought out the flavor in each dish.   The Food: The menus will change seasonally to take advantage of the ripest produce Arizona has to offer. The current menu incorporates local ingredients such as Arizona pistachios, honey and goat cheese from Black Mesa Ranch. St. Francis is one of only a handful of restaurants that are able to use rare herbs from Sonoma.   Last night I started with the baked goat cheese with walnut herb pesto and toasted bread, it was absolutely delicious. The cheese and walnuts were so fresh I had to go easy not to ruin my appetite for dinner.  For my main I had the pepper-crusted flat iron steak with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes covered in a red wine reduction.  The steak was phenomenal; it was so tender I could cut it with a fork. I was also pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the creamed spinach.  Desert was also amazing; I went with the summer fruit trifle as it seemed a lighter dish. It had strawberries, peaches, raspberries and some other berry I couldn't nail down, all surrounded in a light cream topped with toasted almonds. It was heaven.  The Service:  The server was awesome. She explained the philosophy of the restaurant along with the vision of the chef. She was quick to point out her favorite meals and her parents were seated next to us. It was nice to see so many friends and family in a newly opened spot.   This place will become a part of my regular restaurant rotation in CenPho. Quality ingredients, wonderful layout and educated staff make this a 5 star review.

Top ranking in unknowledgeable employees and horrible customer service. I came in to get a base spray before a wedding and somehow got upsold to a monthly membership. It doesn't include the spray tanning and I don't bake in beds. I asked at the time if I could cancel, they said at any time. They forgot to mention you have to come in to fill out paperwork and can't do it via phone, and even though I have NEVER ONCE used the beds they wouldn't refund the fee.   Not impressed and won't be back.

Who are they kidding? $475 jeans that looked like they came from Kmart and a brand I didn't recognize... This place is crap. Techno music and strobe lights blasting so loud I couldn't stand to try anything on...   Drove by yesterday and saw they were closed. Shocking.

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta... I heard that song last time I walked in. The guy that made my sandwich kept rubbing snot off his nose and didn't wash his hands. He asked me if I wanted the wiz or if I was a skirt... Can you call a girl a skirt....?.... I went with the wiz wanting to appear like a educated philly girl.  It was gross, really gross. The meat tasted freezer burned and so did the fries.. Slathering the crap in cheese wiz only made it more apparent that I was going to have a heart attack before finishing it. Don't eat here, you'll be sorry.. Your stomach will drop kick you over and over. Cheese Wiz is gross.. They have other things on the menu, like greasy grease sloshed around in cheese, or for a healthier version you can add grease soaked mushrooms and peppers to your cheese soaked brittle bun. Warning - Only skirts do that. When you go to Corleones you wanna be a gangsta. Ok maybe not.. but I did want to cap the bitch that frightened me into ordering the wiz..

La Canasta, why do you have a big security guard at the front door? Perhaps because you are afraid a bunch of bandits may sneak in and steal all of your delicious salsa? I wouldn't be surprised. The chunky salsa was fresh and full of green chilies and peppers.. The hot sauce so smokey and powerful I had to stop myself from sucking it right out of the bottle. I went for lunch and ordered some special chimichanga.. It was loaded with tender chunks of marinated chicken, covered in a spicy red (not enchilada, more chipotle tasting) sauce and covered in cheese. Wow - really really good. My only complaint? I spilled my margarita right after they sat it down :( Damn clutz, and they charged me for another..Hey it WAS my fault..I was so depressed I ate the entire chimichanga plate and washed it down with another bottle of hot sauce.

I had lunch here again the other day and I realize I was either very high or absolutely starving last time I ate here. This visit I pretty much had the opposite experience. The food was horrible. The salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. They sat us in a room under a TV and it was so loud we could barely talk. I'll have to go back though... At least give them one more shot..

I don't like to criticize Art not being an artist, nor music not having the balls to get on stage myself. That being said I went to Phix last night to see a band, the place was lacking AC, the bathrooms were disgusting, the sound sucked, the art.... I paid $8 bucks for that torture and that hour of my life I will not get back.

I went to Radio Milano for my second time this weekend and I have to say this place is excellent~. The first time I went I sat at the bar as the restaurant was pretty packed. The bartender was super friendly and made a lot of specialty drinks with great twists like basil Martinis and Ginger Press's with Tito's Handmade Vodka, my dining partner got the Old Rye and really enjoyed it.  The food here is excellent, we split the veggie plate app and it was both filling and delicious - it contained cantaloupe, leeks, peppers, green beans, asparagus and other grilled vegetables, it was served with a red pepper dipping sauce that rocked. I've also tried the swordfish and although a little dry it was pretty amazing. There are quite a few other things on the menu I am dying to go back and try (deviled eggs, papardelle pasta, meatloaf, shattered chips...). The atmosphere here is simple and swanky and the kitchen is completely open (always a good sign). I would recommend this place to anyone for any occasion.    One note - There is limited parking so take advantage of the free valet.

Went to the Claim Jumper yesterday to check out their happy hour.  I've dined there before and the food is decent. ***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged, menus finally arrive, drink orders are placed (I get a glass of wine, my dining partner gets a coke) we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still haven't ordered.  At this point I'm getting the hungry cranky pains and the irritability is setting in...Drink the wine, calm down...  Finally the waitress comes back to take our order (bringing another coke and he hasn't even finished half of the first).. We order the shrimp taquitos and crab cakes. After another grueling 15 minutes our order arrives (with another coke). The taquitos are a shrimp (tail intact) wrapped in a corn chip and fried, they serve the 4 with some slimy sweet sauce and a poor excuse for dressed up tartar sauce. The crab cake (not cakes) comes out and it was pretty delicious, but at $10.95 it better have been. Here's the skinny on the crab cakes $12.95 for 2, the happy hour "special" takes 2 dollars off any app on the menu, knocking it down to $10.95 - what they don't tell you is they take away the other crab cake! Cheeky rip off!  Still being hungry we order the nachos, I'll post a picture later just to show how gross they were. The guacamole was brown, I think they added it prior to baking. The nachos which consisted of cheese and black beans. They were so soggy, I don't think they drained the beans before piling them on. Also the menu boasted of an array of different salsas, there were 2 jars, they were both the same salsa.  Bill came (with another coke) - $30 bucks, I went home and made a sandwich.

Switch lured me in for breakfast last Saturday boasting of $1 mimosas. She forgot to mention they were made with bad OJ (or was it Sunny D?). She also left out the breakfast burrito I was ordering was pretty much inedible.  I got the ham, egg and cheese burrito and it was not blended. So you either got an egg bite or a ham bite. I hate that. I'm sorry Switch but I won't be coming back (unless of course you have $1 Sangria..)

Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?  We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.

I was looking for a particular pair of undies for a Halloween costume and I had called several stores with no luck. When I reached Fascinations the girl on the phone told me they not only had them in stock, but had them in several different colors. I was also able to pick up a pair of sexy tights on clearance for 3 buck (whoohoo).  They have a large selection of DVDs and toys and the people that work there are very nice and friendly.

I'm a big fan of this place. Usually come here with Tori B. as she is the only reason I venture out to Chandler. They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2.50 margs, $4 Tres Olives and $1 off beer and wine. The food is pretty basic (and honestly priced a tad high for what it is). They have fish, shrimp, steak, pork and veggies. You can have these served up in a taco, burrito or salad. Like I said pretty basic. What really sets this place apart is the owner and the service. Every time I come in he is super friendly and always asks us to try new things he is thinking of adding to the menu. One time it was a spicy jalapeño corn, and last time it was a honey chipotle vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was awesome and he even gave me the recipe (no I will not share it).  If you're in Chandler and looking for a cheap happy hour in decent environment give Juan's a try. You'll be glad you did.

This mall is so crappy... The only saving grace is Macy's, it has a small selection but there are always really great clearance items. Did I  mention some girl had brought her boom box in and sat it at the register so she could jam out to puffy combs or some crap. Ok minus 2 more for Macy's.  I found myself at Fiesta last night, I needed clothes for work and did not want to drive to Chandler and fight the crowds. I pulled up at first excited at the great parking spot I scored, then I walked in and remembered why I never come to this mall. It is the ghetto fab mini me of malls. I lapped the entire place in about 25 minutes, the Dillard's is an absolute joke. I think the men's section had more clothes than the women's, junior's and misses put together. Needless to say I walked around for an hour, went to every store there and came out with 2 shirts. I could have saved myself the frustration and went to Chandler instead. Yea there may be crowds but the stores are large with great selections so you don't have to go to 10 ghetto stores to find a top. I was so irritated I didn't even get a pretzel.

I love this headquarters. They have one of the largest selections of E-Cig juice in the valley. The glass selection seems a little weak but I'm not sure that matters for the majority of the HQ clientele.   The guys that work here are amazingly friendly and knowledgeable. No high pressure to buy anything and the prices are spot on.

Meh. The only thing worse than the food here was the service..  Evertime I went for lunch it was dead (no shock). Even with no one in the place the servers were absent.. And now... Yep they're closed. (Big shock).

I'm a native, I've lived in this beautiful state 35 years. I don't think a year has gone by when I have not attended the fair.  This year was no exception.   I ate a turkey drum, deep fried twinkie, corn dog, grilled corn, caramel apple and a kebab (it was a long day).  I rode so many rides I almost puked. I can't remember the names of them, but they have a recently new one and it spins you  while circling you high in the air. I got nauseas and it was fantastic.   I saw carnies with feathered hair and missing teeth. I saw gangbangers smoking who knows what. I saw a really trashy, heavy lady being pulled around in a  red rider wagon by an equally trashy and heavy man. Did I mention she only had one shoe on?  I saw goats and chickens and pigs and they had a Bodyworks exhibit this year.  My boyfriend bought me a koala bear hat and his son a toy gun.  We spent over 200 bucks and went home with sunburns and sickness. I love the fair!

Bountiful Baskets absolutely rocks!  I have bought it about a dozen times now and have never once been disappointed. I love the fact that it is a mystery basket. If you don't like that I suggest you take your unadventurous palate to the grocery store and continue to buy the same boring veggies you have eaten all your life. I have had such interesting things, mini pineapple, tangelos, some strange lemon mango hybrid, all kinds of squash, pomegranates and countless others.   There is a location on I17 @Kodiak Produce where the pick up time is 11am for you lazy people that can't get out of bed at 7am on a Saturday. Yes I am one of those people. They always have extras produce items to take home at that location.   I would suggest splurging on a bread pack once in a while as they are scrumptious. I got one over the holidays and the lemon and cranberry bread was the best I have ever had. (Sorry Summer's Fruit Barn).  All in all bountiful is a fun experience. I usually split my basket with someone because I would get so much produce it was hard for me to consume it all before it spoiled. I just bought a juicer so that problem is solved. If you love fruits and veggies give it a try, you never know what you'll come home with.

Dog Park? Who are they kidding?! This place was crap, and full of crap.. It looks as though people went in to this park just so their dogs could poop. There were no clean up mitts and it was small and stinky.  Whoever designed this dog park should be kicked in the balls. No grass, all gravel and the one water spigot? That's right -  outside of the park. Brainiack. I wish I would have yelped this before I went. What a waste.

Big, big fan of Bombero's. I've been here a handful of times now and never been disappointed. The big fire pit on the outside patio is awesome. It can be a nice center piece for a big group to chat around, or it  can create a romantic dining experience for 2.  It is a café and wine bar so keep that in mind. The menu is limited to paninis, bruchetta and meat and cheese plates. (Try the fig and brie!)  They have a great selection of South American wines, however they can be a little on the pricey side (most glasses start at $10) so I would opt for bottles whenever possible. I just really love the small, intimate atmosphere of this place and can't wait to see how they expand the menu. They do brunch now and it is rumored that they have excellent coffee, I can't wait to try it.

Bomberos for breakfast!  I had the cabeza bagel sandwich with fruit and the man had the chimichura  with spicy potatoes . Both were delicious. It was raining outside so we dined in and the rain and crowdedness created quite a cozy ambiance. Their coffee is excellent too!

Bombebero's you've won my five star rating. I am now a regular for breakfast; the last dish was the Uruguayo - Spanish chorizo, diced tomatoes, roasted red peppers, cotija cheese, fresh herbs and a splash of chimichurri sauce. I can't even describe how delicious this dish is. The Spanish chorizoyou use is top notch.   You've won my heart and my five star review for being the perfect place to dine any time of day. You are great to bring out of towners you want to impress with your patio. Your cheese selection is fantastic and your overall ambiance unbeatable.   I think I may go today..

This is a great sports complex with well maintained grounds. I recently started coming here for kickball and I was impressed with how well lit and busy it was. Every field was packed and the bathrooms were in good shape.   Only four stars because there are no soap dispensers in the bathrooms (ewwwww).

Holy canolli this place is fantastic! How have I never been here before?   The set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes, Frank Sinatra, Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. It really reminded me of Artie Bucco's sister restaurant.     The service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable.  We even heard the owner/chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen "wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar!" it was classic. He really showed a passion for both the guests and the food.    I had read a few yelp reviews before I chose this place and I can only mirror what everyone else said. The Italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing. The spaghetti and meatballs were to die for. The meatballs LITERALLY melt in your mouth. I want to go back and try everything on the menu.    Spoiler Alert  - After the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99, you get the number and dinner is free. We didn't win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal. I will be back - I am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back!

How is this place still open? Tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience. Every time the food is HORRIBLE. Last experience included gross Bloody Mary's not work the two bucks, an overcooked  and under seasoned salmon, soggy greasy fries and bad service.   I will not come back here.

Lunch on Mill for under $7? Yes please.   I can't believe how many times I have walked by Munchies and not stopped in, I didn't even know it was Mediterranean. They have daily specials including a drink for $6.50.   Today I went with a co-worker and had the Gyros Pita it contained tender sliced gyros with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and an awesome tzatziki sauce on soft pita. It came with a pretty large salad of tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, red peppers and feta cheese with a tangy creamy dressing.   I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was for fresh and fast food. I am a fan! I can't wait to go back and try the schwarma.

Yuck. This place is gross. Tortillas and lettuce are not fresh, salsa sucks - tastes like tomato sauce. TV's are annoying. That aside the patio and happy hour are decent - just go for drinks.. Or get so drunk you can't tast how bad the food is. Or better yet, walk down to Taco Del  Mar - it's actually better than the food here.

How did I not know what a torta was? For some reason I had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type bread...Was it nightmares of Taco Bell? I'm really not sure... I was quite hesitant when my friend suggested Tortas La Presa. "I don't like tortas" I thought... Well I was very, very wrong. The staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness. Lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menu.  These tortas here are served on a soft, fresh bolillo bun. I can't remember the name of the one I had but it was something Reyes.. It had carne and queso fresco with avocado, lettuce and tomatoes.. My friend had one with mozzarella cheese, both were absolutely delicious. I watched soccer on the big TV and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata. I can't wait to go back and try every one on the menu..This place rocks.

Let me tell you something!  There is nothing filthy about Phil. He is one of the greatest guys on the planet. Get drunk and leave your Harley outside, Phil will take care of it for you.  The drinks are cheap and strong, the lady bartenders are hot, there are  great signs everywhere and the fucked up clock helps to keep you there.   You can see panties with balls hanging from the ceiling and hear never ending stories from the regulars.   My favorite part is the list of people who have been 86'd. That's right, caused such a ruckus they are NEVER EVER allowed back in. No I am not on that list (yet).

The iced toddy is the best in town, I love the fact that they have soy creamer. Today I went in to find they now have pastries from Essence. The barista talked me in to a chocolate filled croissant, it was probably 1200 calories and absolutely delicious.

This Costco is so crappy. It is a really small store as far as Costco's are concerned. There is an even smaller selection of merchandise, very slim on variety and consistency of brands. The parking here is a nightmare and you have to walk though Christown mall to enter.... Boooo...

This particular location is great.  It is always well stocked (literally thousands of shoes) and they seem to turn over new shoes more often than other DSW's.   I'm a  shoe addict a bargain fiend so  this place is paradise. I have never left empty handed and on several occasions I have scored shoes that retail for over $200, for around $50. There are mirrors everywhere and bags placed all over the store to help you carry your newfound twin treasures.  Oh and the rewards program rocks, they incent you for buying shoes and my last order I had $30 off in certificates. AWESOME!

I cannot sing their praises loud enough.The customer service here is over the top. Free tire rotations and a pull up air service which is perfect for lazy little me. I buy all my tires here and if I ever have a leak or a nail, they service it FOR FREE.   They have a great magazine selection and you can schedule appointments online.  Awesome!

I kept driving by and seeing a sign "Summer Special - Two meals, salad and wine for $40" I had heard decent reviews about this place so we decided to give it a try this week.  I was impressed to hear you could choose ANY item on the menu for your salad and entrees; you weren't limited to a smaller selection.   We ordered the following:  LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE ~ Mussels, calamari, shrimps, with Fra Diavolo sauce ($19.95) MELANZANE PARMIGIANA*~ Layers of eggplant with mozzarella, tomato and parmesan ($14.95) 2 Salads ($9) Bottle of Sangiovese 'Polesio' ($34)  With tax and tip this meal would have been around $100, so walking out paying about half that made for a great dining experience. The food was very authentic, it tasted like you had just stepped in to an old Italian grannies kitchen. The bread was fresh and the ambiance romantic.   I'm going with 4 stars, but honestly if we had paid full price, it would probably only be 3.. (Oh and they really should spruce up the bathrooms, they were gross).

Went back again last week, the menu has improved but the service seemed to have gotten worse. Our waitress disappeared for over 20 minutes, after bringing us the wrong check. I was finally able to flag her down and tell her about the check only to wait another 15 minutes for her to return. Nothing ruins a perfectly nice dining experience like a 45 minute wait for the bill...

Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive.   I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again.

I went in to Road Runner to buy a gift card for my boss. This store carries everything a crazy runner could want. There is a wide variety of clothing, shoes and all sorts of  accessories for running. The service was fast and friendly and since I had some extra time I walked around the store. I thought it was pretty cool that you could try on a pair of shoes and run with them on a treadmill before you buy them. Or you could run barefoot and they look at your pressure points to see how your foot hits, then recommend the right kind of shoe for you. Pretty neat. If I ran I would probably appreciate this even more.

Big fan of this chain. Love the chicken artichoke dish and the voodoo tuna. Recently discovered brunch, I got the quesadilla with tomatillo sauce and it was delicious. My man got the french toast, big, fluffy and tasted like candy.   Now the best part: $3 your choice of vodka and a MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY BAR!!! Whoohoo! They have everything you can possibly imagine, including 4 different mixes to choose from.

Realizing I had to head straight the Yelp Event at Finnegan's from work tonight I was in a dilemma. I didn't bring clothes and didn't want to show up in my monkey suit, so I yelped some spots and decided to check out Pitaya. Like the other reviewers I love that it is organized by color, it makes everything so much easier to find and helps you to pick out an outfit much faster. I wouldn't go quite as far as to compare it to H&M, I didn't see any $10 shirts or 10 year old sales clerks.. I did find a top for under $30 and although the material does seem flimsy it was cute enough to buy (at least I'll get don a  few outfits out of it). I wasn't looking for classy, long term wear - just cute and fun..  The girls working there were extremely helpful without being pushy which is always nice. They also had a lot of cute accessories and good music playing while I was there (big plus). Considering all the clothing stores to shop on Mill this one wins my vote and I will certainly return.

What genius came up with this idea? Let's see, what would be a great idea for a new sports bar/ restaurant. Hmm how bout have chicks in corsets and lingerie serve the food and dance. I'm a member of lunch club and was sent a 50% off coupon for this place..Called a few friends and we all met there for lunch. I had no idea what to expect, but women walking around in lingerie at noon was not it. In addition (no offense) the girls were not attractive.. I would have paid them to put more clothes on.. It was like seeing the D dancers, only in broad daylight and I wasn't drunk, I was clad in my corporate attire on my lunch break. Weird. The food was horrible, really horrible, but I don't suppose many people are going for the food. The chicks couldn't even get in to the "fantasy" they were supposed to be creating. At one point a girl hopped up on  table and began hula hooping with the most bored expression on her face.. And she couldn't hula hoop either so her show lasted about 7 seconds. Lame.

Raffaele's pizza is splendid and so are the wings. I've only gotten take out or delivery; this isn't really a dine-in joint. They do a large cheese pizza and 20 wings for 25 bucks!~ That is a STEAL considering it is always over 30 bucks with less wings at other nearby places.  The strip mall is ghetto and they don't have a website but the NY style pizza is worth picking up the phone for delivery.

Ok, so I don't wear a wig, nor have ever purchased extensions.. but if I did, this is where I would go. This place is THE source for Indian hair, Bohyme hair and Pre-Tipped and Clip-In hair extensions (as boasts their website). I've walked around this store several times and tried their wigs on, so much fun! .. The hair they use is Indian hair donated at Hindu temples in India. So it is the real deal, and you can curl and color it too. The hair is a bit pricey ($100 for extensions, $200+ for wigs), but If you're looking to change your looks or have the misfortune of losing your hair check out Sunny's.

The Walmart Neighborhood Market opened last week. I heard a lot of rumors that it was supposed to be the "Fresh and Easy" of Walmarts. I'm not a huge fan of Fresh and Easy - I find them so so, asi asi, good for some stuff but can't do everyday grocery shopping there.  The Walmart store carries groceries, a great produce section, bakery items, meat and frozen foods. their deli section left much to be desired.. Perhaps it was because I was there on opening day, but there wasn't much variety or selection. In fact there wasn't much variety of products other than the Hispanic foods, they have an entire section devoted to Marquez Brothers (a local company) so that was pretty cool. I grabbed a few items (crappy wine selection btw) and made my way to the cashiers. Now I know it was opening day, but none of them knew how to work their registers. It took me over 20 minutes to check out (I had 4 items)..  Inpsite of the grocery store theme I still can't get past the taste of Walmart in my mouth. I'll probably still drive across the street to Fry's.

Driving down University I spotted a new lunch destination, Thai Elephant. Always excited for new dining options I went there today with a coworker. The food was good and I learned that Thai Elephant is owned by the same family who runs Thai Basil just down the road. Their menu was quite large and although the lunch specials were decently priced we ventured off an had the Seafood Tofu. It was great, the portion was generous and they did not skimp on the seafood - there were mussels, octopus, shrimp and scallops. The tofu in the dish was awesome, fried to perfection and incredibly firm, this with crisp sugar snap peas, carrots and onions all served in a garlic brown sauce. We both had Thai tea (although I am not sure why I always order this ad Thai resturants, I don't like it - way to sweet) and it was a nice balance to the spiciness of the dish. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes that were jumping out at me on the menu.

I typically like Paradise Bakery. They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other "fast" places in my area.   This location however, needs some work. The service as always is good, but the food leaves much to be desired. The iced tea is atrocious. I can't exactly pinpoint it, I think the container/brew filters need to be cleaned because the taste is stale. In addition to that, it is completely watered down so you can't taste the mango at all. I actually did a taste comparison to ensure I wasn't losing my mind. After lunch at Paradise Bakery I went to PV Mall and tried the tea at the location there and it was great.   The chicken salad was also huge let down. The strawberries and pineapple were not fresh, they came in heavy sweet syrup. Needless to say I was not in Paradise and will probably pass this place on my way to Wildflower going forward.

I stumbled on to a gem!   I was walking out of Safeway realizing we were not going to make it to the movies on time if we took our chances at Giuseppe's when I glanced over and saw Noca.   Strip Mall location and all we decided to give it a try.  The place was packed so we took a seat at the bar and our server/bartender was very and attentive and amusing.  This place is amazing! It is small, but has a great layout and an open kitchen full of activity. The food was basic and delicious, I had a pasta dish with sausage and herb butter. Simple but prepared well with exceptional quality ingredients that you could taste at first bite.  The owner Eliot Wexler sat us and came by to check on us, another example of excellent service.  The meal ended with cotton candy, quite a sweet surprise for our first visit. And it rounded out the meal nicely. I was a bit disappointed with the desert menu.. donuts and cookies? I think they could get a bit more creative.  Either way this was truly a 5 star delicious dining experience.

Blah. Always excited to try new south side fair I headed in on Friday, the place was dead and the TV's were blaring. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and waited about 30 minutes for my order and it was horrible. The pork was fatty and dry and they tried to disguise it by adding a gallon of BBQ sauce on top. The sauce itself was too sweet and the side of beans tasted like chili. Overall it was barely edible. The tables were sticky and needed a serious wipe down. Hopefully the service and food improves with age.

I will run on the treadmill for an hour to indulge in the deliciousness that is Louisiana Fried Chicken. The fried chicken is moist and spicy, I paired it with fried okra and mashed potatoes and gravy. It was probably a 2500 calorie meal and I loved every single bite.

After reading so many banging reviews I decided to hop in to DD's and give it a try. I was immediately impressed with the selection. Tons of fresh salads, sandwiches and mains. I was feeling to lazy to cook so I picked up the garlic mashed potatoes (FANTASTIC for garlic lovers), the grilled veggies (delicious). I also got the turkey meatloaf that while a little dry, had a wonderful flavor and consistency. Next time I may have to pick up some sauce for the top. Same can be said for the pork, it was a bit dry, but I had some mango chutney I threw on top and it was great.   I can't wait to come back and try one of their many sandwiches, or soups, or lasagna, or eggplant parmesan, or chili relleno... You get the picture.  Dinner for 2 for about 20 bucks and home made meals without the hassle of cooking. This place rocks.

Was it just an off night? I had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed. Went on a Monday and the place was dead. I know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes:  To start - I found the décor to look a bit cheesy, like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel.. What's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti? The music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker, by the time we got our food we could barely see.  Our waitress was nice and recommended her favorites. So many people have raved about this place, but I found the fusion either bland or overspiced.   Shabu Hot and Sour was served first - This soup had no spice to it at all, even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice. The lime broth, while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat, so we just picked out all the veggies.   Spicy Wontons came out next - Chicken and pepper jack.. This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages, no flavor and very little amount of chicken.  Volcano Beef - Nice touch on the "sear it yourself" hot rock. We could see the beef was marinated, but we couldn't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger.   At this point we were so disappointed with the food, and still hungry. We left and walked down the street to Moira, another disappointment. Review to follow.

I love Trader Joe's!   This location in particular is always well stocked and has super friendly employees. They keep my fridge well stocked and I love a lot of their pre-made items. Some of my recent favorites: Carne Asada, Pizza Thins, Tikka Masala Simmer Sauce, Biryani Rice, Hummos, and Frozen Tamales. I could go on for days.   The wine selection is awesome for the size of the store and the sweets are addicting. They also have a great amount of vitamins and supplements. Now if they could only improve the produce section I wouldn't need to shop anywhere else.

I love this place. The concept of sharing really does it for me (thanks mom). You get to try so many dishes instead of just one, it's like taking your taste buds on an adventure.   I've been here twice now and already have some faves:   Nosh plate - melons, salami, manchego, pistachios  Dates - stuffed with chorizo and gruyere Mac and Cheese - with prosciutto and breadcrumbs  I can't wait to go back and try the waffle fries. Oh yea and they have Tito's vodka. Big Score!

The SideBar has finally opened!!   I have been anxiously awaiting this opening for months. I went on Friday night and I was blown away. the last time I climbed those stairs the place was the Emerald Lounge, a dive bar at it's finest.. Loud music, dark rooms ect..   I was very excited to the transformation that is now the SideBar. I agree with the other reviewers, the attention to detail is amazing. The interior design is gorgeous, it is urban modern class, and there is nothing "ikeaish" about it. The tasteful decor and amazing lighting set a very laid back relaxing atmosphere. The music selection and volume were great, allowing for conversation and enhancing the overall vibe. (Ladies the girls restroom is gorgeous.. Now if there were only more than one).. I'll have to go back soon and post some pictures as words do not really do this place justice.   I had the opportunity to meet the owners (Mike and Josh), who were gracious and friendly and you could see the excitement in their eyes. The bar manager Jeff is warm and hospitable and mixed up some pretty amazing martinis. They have a wonderful variety of micro brews and an extensive wine selection.   The wait was well worth it, what was once one of my favorite dive bars will now become my new swanky hang out. 5 stars for an excellent job on a long awaited, soon to be new hot spot.

The only thing that brings me to this place is starvation. It is either Jack in the Box, Starbucks or Dunkin within walking distance for breakfast when I am running to late to work to make my own. I have visited this location 3 times, and each time I leave I want to punch myself in the face for going.  Here are the reasons why I will eat my shoe before venturing to Dunkin Donuts again:  You make your own coffee - Doesn't sound so bad right?  WRONG On each of my 3 visits they have been out of almost everything (coffee, creamer, sugar, straws). When I ask the counter worker to refill the coffee she sighed, and then disappeared in back for 10 minutes. The back room is the size of a large closet.. What could possibly take so long? Hygiene! I saw a man sneeze in to his coffee, and then get a refill touching his cup to the spout on the coffee machine. Gross. The counters are filled with trash and spillage.  They charge you more for ice coffee. This is ridiculous. It is the same coffee they brew, then let cool. Why does that cost more?  A man walks in and asks what size the 50 cent coffee is. The girl looks at him and says "it says it on the sign". She is either to dumb to remember or a serious smart ass.   Do yourself a favor. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.

Walmart is, and has always been a disgusting store to shop in. It is listed at the top in my personal book of "Places to Never Return". I would rather pay the extra 10 bucks to not have to be around the crack heads and obese smelly people that shop there. Call me a snob, I really don't care.   That being said, I decided to try my luck with the online Site to Store ordering. I figured how bad can it be..? All I have to do is walk in and pick up the item. No shopping, no standing in line to pay.. Sounds painless right...  I walk in and have no idea where the Site to Store pick- up area is. I try to ask the greeter, but he is busy picking his nose and arguing with a homeless guy. I go to the Customer Service Center line and stand there for 27 minutes. I actually saw 2 people go on break while there were about 10 of us waiting in line.  When it is finally my turn some snooky clone tells me it is in the back of the store through the pet section. Sure that makes sense, much more sense than just putting a sign up directing me where to go.  I get back there and wait another 30 minutes for the guy to get my order and bring it up. By this time I have to use the bathroom (I've been in the store over an hour).   I walk back to the front of the store and the bathroom is closed. Someone took a diaper and wrote their name on the wall with the poo. No I am not kidding, it is really that disgusting.   I got home and the patio set I bought was missing several parts. I went to a hardware store and bought them. I'm never going to Walmart again.

I am late in reviewing this but still felt a need to voice off on what a fantastic evening I had. The food was amazing. There was a excellent salad bar with items such as mozzarella, roasted red peppers, salmon, asparagus, marinated mushrooms and all sorts of salads. One could honestly fill up on one circle of the salad bar, but I was careful to save room for the delicious meats.  The selection of meat was incredible, from what I can remember: bacon wrapped filet mignon, top sirloin, lamb chops and leg of lamb, chicken in garlic, sausage, pork ribs, bacon wrapped chicken and on and on. The sides were great too, crispy polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas.    What really made this night special was the amazing service. We were given a tour of the kitchen so we got to see how it was all prepared. Our server was also quick to make sure we were able to taste every meat selection they had, and to send the guys over had we requested more of a particular item.    This was a 5 star dining experience and I will definitely be back. Thanks Gabi!

I live in a development at the bottom of South Mountain and about twice a year the scorpions come off the mountain and in to my house to stay warm or cool. They have a mission to live in my home and sting/and or terrorize me and my dog.  Scorpions are my least favorite of all the anthropods.. Picture a scary creature that glows under a blacklight, has eight legs, crab like pinchers and a stinging tail.. I can't stand them. I sprayed last May and that lasted until this month. Then I saw 4 in one week. The deal breaker was when the dog alerted me to one crawling on the bedroom wall. I gave up and started calling around.  I called several companies (Orkin, Terminex, Rid ect) and found that they are all very expensive... they all wanted to lock me in to a one or two year contract and the cost was more than $400. My current economic situation being what it is, I only wanted a one time spray. It is much cheaper to have them come out when the scorpions show up, than to pay for year round treatment. And I have no other problems (knock on wood) no crickets, ants roaches, nothing.  I had used Stapley before and still had their card so I gave them a ring. They came out the next day and sprayed my house down like it was on fire, I mean they drenched it. Standard service right? So why 5 stars? The guy that came out was AWESOME. Then I remembered why I liked him so much the first time. Not only did he spray my house, but he took me out back and walked me around to show me where I had a termite tunnel, then her showed me my breakers where the termite company certification was so I could call them and have them come out and treat my house (FOR FREE). He was informative and friendly and very affordable. I would recommend Stanley to anyone. I haven't seen one of those evil scorpions since.

WTF happened to Chili's? I used to frequent the one on Mill Ave for lunch because they were fast and the food was usually pretty decent. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking gourmet or healthy, but it at least tasted decent.   We went to this location for dinner the other night and it was absolutely horrible. The service was incredibly slow, we ordered and it took over an hour  and a game of chase with our waitress to finally get our food. We complained to her about the wait and she offered no apology. When we finally did get our food it was cold.. Not luke warm, but cold. In addition to that, the famous Southwestern Eggrolls were a soggy mess. I rarely complain to a manager but this situation warranted a big complaint.   The manager was nice and gave us 20% off the bill and a free gross dessert to go. We ended up pitching it in the trash, it was completely inedible. Chili's you have officially made the Blacklist.

What else can be said about this place? It carries every type of lego you could possibly dream of. They have gift sets (so bring a wad of cash cause they are not cheap). The employees are friendly and helpful and they will even help you look for things online if they do not carry them in store. If you need legos, look no further.

Came for lunch the other day and with a few changes this place will really shine (like serve bread before the meal, improve the timing of the food ect.). I liked the ambiance and décor, cozy and classy.  I missed the art because I had my back to that wall, but the colors they chose were great and the bar had a nice set up.  I had the bread salad and pasta lunch special, it came with an iced tea for $12 which I thought was a very reasonable price. The bread salad was amazing, it was fresh and delicious and the pasta (I can't remember what it was called) was a mix of vine ripened tomatoes and pecorino. You could tell at first bite the pasta was home made, and it was served perfect al dente. I thought the portions were perfect (but I don't super size everything I eat :)  My date ordered the Orecchiette con Salsicciaa which was pasta, home-made sausage, greens and pecorino. I'm not sure if they over-salted the water or had too salty of pecorino but the salt was overkill. Not inedible, but close. He ate it all, and told our server afterward who in very good spirit said he would pass it in to the chef.   I will definitely give this place another shot in the future. The location is great and they are working out the kinks.

Great bar with a nice downtown location and super friendly staff. There is plenty of seating either at the bar (comfy tweed barstools with ample purse hooks) or the main area (high leather booths, armchairs and couches).   I haven't had the food but the drink prices are spot on incredibly cheap during happy hour. They usually have some sort of Irish bad or singer during the weekends. This is a fun spot to meet with a group before heading out downtown.

I had been meaning to try Burger Studio (despite most of the bad yelp reviews) for a while now. I walked in expecting the same level of décor as Scramble or Il Posto next door, it looks nice from the outside. Looks can be very deceiving, and this joint really proves that statement.   Burger Studio reminded me of the Rocky Point of burgers, faded menus, sticky counter tops, slow service, bathrooms out of order and condiments stacked on tables that looked like they had been sitting in the sun for years (see pics).   If that wasn't bad enough my veggie burger had freezer burn, and if you advertise Boca burgers don't slip me some generic veggie burger thinking it is the same thing.   the totts were so overdone they almost broke a tooth. Did I mention they don't sell bottled water? I've had more enjoyable experiences at Burger King.

What can I add that has not already been said? Monday and Tuesday $20 bottle and plank of bruchetta, Wednesday word of the day for $5 glasses and Saturday, Sunday divine brunch.  The setting is awesome allowing you to dine in or outside,  and with 9 months of gorgeous weather you can't go wrong. Anything on the menu is excellent and the servers are really cool and helpful with suggestions.   Only drawback is that the parking sucks, pay the "free" valet or get a 16 dollar ticket. Yes I speak from experience.

Goodness for Goodness' sake! Luci's is awesome, the slogan is correct. The market portion carries great local and regional items and contains all sorts of sundries (produce, spices, dairy, hand cream and beer and wine). I always find something unique to take home for dinner.   My much loved breakfast is the burrito bomb  - scrambled eggs, chicken chorizo, sweet potatoes and cheese wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla and served with spicy salsa. It is heaven.  There is a roll up garage door that is almost always open making the atmosphere very inviting. The coffee is strong and the service is top notch, this is my favorite spot for a quick breakfast!

Perhaps I was just cranky after my disappointing meal at Sens, but we walked in to Moira thinking it couldn't get much worse. WRONG. What's up with the glow lights under the bar? Lame. What's up with the uncomfortable metal chairs? Double lame.  We had already had a few dishes at Sens so we weren't all that hungry and just ordered the tempura shrimp and the jade roll. The menu boasted that the shrimp came sprinkled with shichimi "seven tastes".. Is that the 7 tastes of the oil it was fried in? That's what it tasted like..  The jade roll was soft shell crab, avocado and cucumber. Sounds good right? Not when it is served HOT. Who ever heard of a hot sushi roll?   So ended the night with two bad experiences at down town restaurants. Triple lame ;(

I've been here a few times now and I think I must have had better experiences than others.. I usually sit at the bar so the service is fast. I love how open and bright it is inside of the restaurant. The décor is cool and the lighting at night is very soft so it sets a casual tone.    I read all the reviews with people complaining about small portions, but I have to state the opposite. I love going to a restaurant and actually finishing most of my meal. Americans are used to eating substantially bigger portions than the rest of the world. I don't think the portions are small,  they are just not gordo portions you see in most Mexican establishments.  Did I mention they do two types of Sangria and they are not overly sweet! I think the food an atmosphere at this place are great and I will definitely be back.

I have been to Gallo Blanco a few times now and have always been please with both the food and the service.   Some of my favorites included the Elote Callejero wich is grilled corn covered in cotija cheese and then heavily sprinkled with smoked paprika.  $2 tacos (they're small and delicious). I've tried them all but I must say the Cochinitas (pork marinated with achiote, orange, garlic and guajillo) were the best.  I also had a white sangria (I usually prefer red but this was light and refreshing) it had lemons, grapes, mangoes, oranges, apples - delicious! They don't make it too sweet with is a big win every time.   For breakfast I tried the Huevos Rancheros and was very pleased with the spicy tomato sauce that came with it. I also ordered the Fruta con crema fresca (mixed fruit w/ whipped Crema Fresca) very fresh and nice variety of fruit.   The menu is pretty limited, but what they do  - they do well. The prices are excellent and the dining area open and airy. I can see myself frequenting this place a lot this summer.

If Verona Chophouse had a theme song it would be "So Fresh, So Clean" by Outkast. This place was amazing, truly immaculate. Flawless table décor and settings,  highly organized number system, beautiful swan ice sculpture, a true treat for the eyes. I had searched around for weeks looking for the perfect and affordable Mother's Day brunch, and  I hit the mother load with  Verona.   The service was superb, we were given drinks right away and never was my champagne glass empty. Our server had perfect timing, bringing the check just as we finished and promptly returning.   The food (oh gawd the food) was unbelievable. I was so impressed with the freshness, variety and quality of all the options. I won't detail everything but to give you an idea of the different offerings:  * Salad Bar, 10 types of cheeses, tightly wrapped meats, tons of different crackers, every veggie imaginable  * Breakfast offerings of different egg and potato dishes, bacon, sausages, chicken, grilled asparagus, huge assortment of breads  * Carving station with Prime Rib and Filet Mignon   * Omelet Bar  made to order and the chef was able to prepare in under 3 minutes!  * Seafood bonanza! Shrimp, crab legs, lobster, clams, mussels, spicy cocktail sauce  *Dessert Bar with fresh pastries, kabobs of fruit you could dip in the chocolate fountain  and ice cream with hot peach cobbler and graham topping  All this for 30 bucks..  "Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh and clean"

Great outdoor patio, couches, big bar, tables, great burgers, huge side of crunchy fries and they carry sweet tea vodka.   Do not order the sangria, unless you like it super sweet. I don't, I'm sweet enough already.

Aye Dios Mios!  I think I have died and gone to carne asada heaven. The reviews were right, Sonora Grill is astounding! I was so impressed with everything I ordered. The carne asada, hands down is the best in the valley. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole... Oh the guacamole... Mas deliciosa!   While the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the 3 salsas I devoured. I was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most Mexican meals. At Sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu. Qué bueno!   The girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff. If I owned a restaurant I would try and steal her away! This is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation.

I love consignment stores! It is absolutely fantastic to take in your old stuff  and eagerly wait for someone to buy it. I grew up in Buffalo Exchange's and I have no problem admitting that I buy used clothing.   Smarty Pants sets itself apart by having a fantastic owner and excellent staff. They never snub their noses at the stuff I bring in, and  that seems to be a rarity in the valley these days. Not only do they carry clothes, shoes and accessories, but they also have furniture and a slew of housewares.  I bought a Marc Jacobs purse for $30 bucks - Take that suckas!  I called yesterday and I have over $40 in credit for clothes I would have otherwise given to Goodwill. Now if I can just make it out of there without passing by the shoes...

I went to R Salon for a brow wax and a partial color and cut. The lady that did my brows was amazing. Her name is Carol and I highly recommend her. She was so thorough and meticulous and shaped my unruly wolf brows better than most others I have been to.   I saw Nikki for my hair and she did a great job on the cut. She really listened to the style I was going for and made suggestions on the color. The color she did turned out exactly how I wanted it (how often can you say that). She was awesome and I will definitely be back to see her.   The only reason this salon is not getting 5 stars is due to the mishap on pricing for my blow out. I was charged $40 (I have thin shoulder length hair) and I found the price ridiculously high. It was actually a mistake and they made good on it when I called to inquire.  This is a fun and hip salon ad the prices are spot on. If you are looking for a new stylists I would give Nikki a ring.

Ordered the french onion soup and it was so salty I could barely eat it. Best part though? The slice of bread on top was a hamburger bun. How LAME.  The waitress was cool and very attentive. My friend ordered chili cheese fries that were huge and tasted decent.  The burger was a greasy mess.   I love the set up of this place, there have been so many different restaurants here and none seem to last long. And with mediocre food I doubt this one will last.

I love seafood and have been to Bluewater quite a few times in the last month. The restaurant is a slight upgrade from the old Fish Market. Nothing spectacular, but pretty consistent with decent food and signature dishes.   For Valentines day my sweet beau made us reservations for the "Upstairs" formerly known as "Top of the Market". This is supposed to be a finer dining, better quality experience than the restaurant down stairs. They had quite a deal for  V-day - two meals (four courses) for $100. That and bottle of wine and we spent just under two bills.    We get to our table and notice our wine glasses were dirty, we ask for some water and start looking over the menu. A solid 15 minutes passes before anyone comes over to us, and again we ask for water. The waiter takes our order, disappears comes back in 10 without our wine and tells us it will only be a few minutes, again we ask for water. So at this point I am slightly irritated, it has been about 30 minutes, the restaurant is hot as hell and we still don't have water..  The courses begin: The food was good for the most part; the crab cakes and salad were very good and the  chowder was excellent. We were served our main courses without silverware and had to wait quite a while and ask twice to get it. By the time they brought it my food was already getting cold.  I ordered the  Surf and Turf and the steak was overcooked and lobster claws were raw. Very disappointing.   Overall we were not impressed with the service or the food. Our expectation are set higher for the "Upstairs", I just wish the managers had the same expectations of the restaurant.

Had dinner again at the Blue and sat downstairs. While my last experience was sub par, the manager Larry more than made up for it this time.  The food was great. We had the clam chowder soup which is always delicious, we moved on to the artichoke, grilled perfectly and ended with stuffed shrimp. Our meal was great and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be back.

Much to my delight I visited again on a Monday and was told it was  1/2 off all bottles of wine. Whoohoo! I sat at the bar and started with the Ducketts Bucket, it was a generous serving of clams and oysters in a light wine, lemon butter broth. I had the Mahi Mahi special for my main served with a side of leeks. It was all pretty delicious.   The food seems to get better every time I come here. I need to remember what a great happy hour they have.

I'm a cheater and a liar. I told Los Olivos I'd be faithful, yet once again I've been a cheating whore. I went to Francis and Sons because they were close and they lured me in with a $9.99 sign. I know, I was dirty and cheap... It didn't think I could be pleased like I am with Los, after all this wasn't going to be a hand job. That was my justification - it wasn't going to be personal... It wouldn't mean anything, it was just a wash.   I hang my head in shame writing this... It wasn't my fault, the machine broke halfway through. I had no choice but to let them finish me off by hand. And it was wonderful, and they waxed my tires for free.   I'm so ashamed..

Tonic is a GREAT happy hour spot. I've been there a few times now for a pre-gaming kickball hangout. The drink specials are awesome and the happy hour lasts until 8:00pm.   The service here is also remarkable. Each time I have sat outside and always had a full drink in my hand. I've tried the pretzel with Guiness cheese dip (sooo good) and both the Old Fashion and Muhammad Ali pizzas are highly suggested. They have a stage inside and it appears there are bands that play there quite often. Either way it is a fun hangout and marvelously easy on the pocket book.

A breakfast spot on Mill? Hurray!   I was so excited when Sucker Punch Sally's opened, I work on Mill and there has not been a "hot" breakfast spot within walking distance in years. By "hot" I mean something other than donuts and bagels. I looked them up online and was confused when the website listed was for a bike shop.. Hmm ok so I can't order ahead. I walked over and placed an order to go. The staff was very friendly, and explained that the owner also owns a bike shop (old school choppers and such) in Scottsdale. They should have the website update soon yadayada.  I ordered a Denver omelet with hashbrowns, walked back to work and opened up the box. I should mention that it was about 10am and I was starving. I would have ate just about anything at that point, or so I thought. I opened up my box and looked down in disgust. Before me was an undercooked omelet (see picture) so undercooked that there was a puddle of yolk/water in the box, and to go with it was a side of freezer burned, undercooked hash browns. The hash browns were browned on the top but raw and soggy underneath. I was so disappointed, I tried choking it down but my taste buds revolted and I had to throw it away. It's interesting  to see 5 star reviews for this place. Lower standards perhaps? Or maybe I just had a bad experience? I doubt that as  there have been 4 other people I work with that have been over there and all had bad experiences. 1 star for getting  the name right, after that breakfast I felt "Sucker Punched".

Not a fan of Jimmy John's and find nothing gourmet about their sandwiches. The location on Mill has a bad set up. The door to the counter is only about 5 feet so when it gets busy customers try and pile in, then the people behind the counter are constantly yelling for them to move out of the doorway.. It's a mess. Also the seating is great for 1 or 2 people, but bring more than that and you are SOL.   I really don't like that there is not 4" option, only 8". I'm not hungry enough to eat an 8" sub for lunch. I want options! I ordered the Italian night club and didn't read the menu close enough to see they include mayo on it. I HATE MAYO. My sub was drenched in mayo, seriously like a pond of mayo. Gross. I couldn't taste any vinaigrette. Who ever heard of putting mayo on an Italian sammy? I think I'll stick to Silver Mine should I need to get  my Mill sub fix on.

Went back today as I feel every place deserves a second chance. I was again irritated that the smallest sub I could order was an 8".  Also I verified on the VITO there is no mention of mayo on the menu,   it states it is served with Italian vinaigrette. I made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their subs. I will not be back.

Pork bowl, chicken bowl, crab puffs. Absolutely delicious!   Quality ingredients, super fresh and tasty side sauces. Honestly I have never had drive through Japanese this good. The owners are awesome and tonight they are staying open late to accommodate my order.  Fast, friendly and fresh. It doesn't get much better at this price and convenience.

I love TMI, they have a great dog friendly patio and awesome servers. Everyone here has always been so friendly, chatty and welcoming that I feel comfortable going alone.   I love the huge selection of beers and wines and the happy hour is CHEAP! The mac n cheese is delicious as is the BLT. Sit on the patio when the weather is nice, sip on a seasonal beer and listen to the great music pumping from the speakers. Sounds fantastic, I can't wait for October!

I have been to Mabel's a few times now and I think it is a pretty stellar place. The food is awesome (try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs) and the drinks are strong. The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale.   Last night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.

Pita Jungle has always been a valley favorite for me. The  Lavosh Chicken Schwarma is one of the tastiest med fresh meals I've had for lunch. This location is ok, the staff is friendly if a little forgetful at times.   The happy hour is where it's at: From 3-6pm they do $1-5 tapas. Some of the menu items include hummus, baba, garlic dip, lemon chicken, mussels and shrimp. Also $1 off beer and wine.  A happy hour that starts at 3? Now that'smy kind of spot.

La Condessa is muy Bueno in many ways. The tacos are always fresh, from shark to carne asada you really can't go wrong. (Although I heard it is bad karma to eat shark).  They carry Mexican beers that I have never heard of before, last time I had an Estrella and it was delicious. They have a full bar with tons of exotic tequilas and they are generous on the pours.  The servers are attentive and sweet and the set up is old style cool.   What really keeps me coming back is the salsa bar (oh the salsa bar)! Pecan salsa, 7 pepper, chipotle, sesame... They carry over a dozen and you will have to come many times to experience the perfect salsa/taco combination. It is worth every delectable trip!

Stumbled in to Hash House after a heavy day of partying like a rock star in Vegas. I ordered the sage benedict and was immediately transported in to an episode of man vs. food and I was up for the challenge. I took that benny down!   Ok really my boyfriend and I split it and we could barely finish it but that carb overload did the job we were hoping it would. We zombied back to our hotel in a food coma and slept for a few hours. Was it healthy? No! but it was worth every delicious bite.

This place was filthy dirty gross. Crap all over the tables, grease on the floor. Employees seemed nonplussed and I probably would too if I was only making $7.80 an hour.   My chicken was soggy and the butter burger tasted like it had seen better days.  Yuck.

I had the misfortune of accidentally breaking my kitchen window. Too add to my chagrin I did this right before the weekend and most businesses that were open were quoting hefty "emergency" replacement fees.    I called about 5 different spots to get estimates explaining the window was only about 3 feet tall by 2 feet wide. I was shocked at the quotes I was given. Most places charged a lot more than I expected, because the windows crank out so there is additional costs for putty and placement. The first couple of guys I talked to gave me their quotes, then told me that was "standard pricing" when I said I was going to call around more. The last guy was actually pretty rude about it. I decided to stop looking  at the well known places and starting skimming the net for contractors.   I finally found Garcia's and was amazed when I was quoted about $200 less than at the other companies. The gentleman that came out was polite, professional and very clean (he even cleaned up some of the broken glass I had missed). He was done in just under an hour and the window looks great.  I would recommend this company to anyone for affordable service and quality work.  Side Note:  It helps also to pay cash as contractors get charged fees to process debit cards.

Half Price is a decent bookstore. They do not pay well for books or CDs, but they do have a great clearance  selection to make up for it.   The store is on the smaller side, but it is well organized and the employees are very friendly and helpful.  I wish they had more places to sit and read, but at least you can bring in dogs to help you find stuff.

"Easy Relax" is this a joke?   This was the most painful and excruciating chair massage I have ever received. I sat down for a 15 minute massage and I immediately knew I was in trouble.  The little dude smashed my face in between two paper towels on a chair with a head opening too small for a child. He then began the assault. He came in too hot - immediately fast, hard and deep.. No easing me in to it, no chair play and no warning.   Apparently me screaming ouch was misinterpreted as "Please attack my back as if I'm a 600 pound sumo wrestler with SIPA disease".  I tried to get up a few times to which he started beating harder on my back. So I sat there and tried to push through the pain.   When he was finished I got up, wiped the black mascara tears from my face, and limped out like a beaten dog.

Excellent body shop.   Everyone was very helpful, from the receptionist to the estimator and the mechanics. They came in under the initial cost estimate and in only a week.  Quality work and a free car wash, I would recommend them to anyone needing body work.

I used Solis for both a mammogram and an ultrasound. The wait to be seen was not bad and they had great magazines in the waiting room. Once I was see the doctor was quite helpful. She really took the time to explain everything with me, including my options for treatment.  Hopefully I will not have to get another mammogram, but if I do,  this is where I would go.

Do you remember being a little girl and begging for a bedazzler for Christmas? Desperately wanting to bling out your jean jackets and rhinestone your name on your backpacks? Do you still carry a torch for all things bedazzled? If so this is the store for you.   From blinged out shirts to booty bedazzled jeans, you can find here and it has been covered in faux diamonds and rhinestones. There are also a ton of the dragon/angel/tattoo looking shirts that some ladies are so fond of.   I don't know if  I should give this place one star or five stars.. I guess it really just depends on your taste in clothing. I wouldn't be caught dead in anything they sell here. But I know a few ladies that may be willing to trade in a Michael Jackson purse for a sparkling hat with "Hot Thing" written in rhinestones.

Ahh Long Wongs.. How I miss your raunchy sewer smell and famous wings. Sneaking in to see bands when I was 19 and getting served. You ruled and I miss you.

Smudges is great! I went to Lisa for Twinkle Toes and I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with the way they turned out. She literally dumps glitter on your toes and then seals it in with gel that hardens under the UV light (just like gel nails or shellac).  She told me it would last a few months and for the price I paid that is an absolute steal! I can't wait to go back and try more colors.

Stingray has an awesome happy hour and it is not limited to just the bar area. You can enjoy half priced drinks and rolls in the entire restaurant until 7pm.   I went there yesterday and tried the lemongrass infused vodka (yum) and had a bunch of different rolls and the calamari tempura. While it may not be the best sushi in town it is more than decent and cheap, cheap, cheap.  Great place to meet up with friends after work, but expect it to be crowded as more people learn about the smoking deal on happy hour.

Best damn Zucchini Fries  I have ever had, sprinkled with parmesan and served with a home made ranch. They are in no way healthy and in every way delicious.  These things will blow your mind. My favorite is the Samburger $10, Applewood Smoked Bacon, substitute Pepperjack cheese.  I really love this place and it is in my regular rotation.

Went to The Vig Uptown for brunch. They need to update their website as they are actually open at 10am (not 11am). I was glad to hear it as I have turned into more of an early bird in my older age and I was impatient and calling by 10:01    I have to admit, I think this I my new favorite brunch spot. I started with a fresh squeezed watermelon mimosa and it was delicious. I ordered some pork and eggs that was out of this world. Slow simmered pork, beans, peas, under an egg and surrounded by grilled bananas, it was awesome! I also tried the yogurt parfait and while it was fresh and delicious there was an overwhelming amount of dried fruit in it. My fillings were hurting by the time I left, but it was still tasty.   Dicks and Phoenix City Grill now have some stiff competition for my favorite brunch dishes. Selfishly, I hope they don't get too busy because it was really nice not to have to wait for valet or a table. One more reason why I love living in Uptown.

Excellent  studio with great instructors. If you are looking for HOT Yoga I highly recommend this place. The instructors are all talented in different ways, but so far Gabe has been my favorite, he has a wonderful selection of music and I prefer his flow movements. When I am there I can literally feel the toxins sweating out of my body and the heat helps me come in to deeper asanas.   If you have never done HOT yoga before, be warned. The class is 90 minutes and you need to come in well hydrated (drink a  gallon of water throughout the day before class). The temperature is over 100 degrees so you will sweat the minute you step in the room. The cleansing benefits are worth it and this studio does it justice!

This restaurant is located on the 15th floor of the casino. There is a dress code warning including no flip flops, t-shirts, shorts or cut offs which helps to keep the casino riff raff out.  There are glass widows lining the restaurant  with tables and booths placed all around them. The mountain and desert views are spectacular and the overall ambiance is classy and captivating.   The food was excellent although a bit overpriced. I had the tenderloin flatbread , the steak was tender and juicy and had the perfect amount of rosemary. The Tuscan kale salad and the fried green tomatoes were also delicious choices prepared with care. I agree with another reviewer who said the wine list pricing was all over the place, luckily the selection made up for the scattered pricing. The bartender we had was personable and friendly and made our visit quite enjoyable.  Overall I don't think I would make dinner reservations here, but it is a nice place to grab an app and a glass of wine and take in the stunning views of our beautiful desert city.

I hadn't been to Iruna since the Yelp Event last year. We made reservation for a party of 8 and were seated immediately upon our arrival. It was awesome to go with a big group because I was able to sample almost everything on the menu.   A few of my favorites: Dates  - Everything is better wrapped in bacon. Chistorra - Spanish chorizo, while a tad hard the flavor was excellent Scallops with White Asparagus - Perfectly cooked Brussel Sprouts - Roasted with Thyme Gambas - Big and juicy Trout - Very moist and the rub was smoky and spicy I was also pretty amazed by both the quail and the duck. Each are items I would not normally order, and each were delicious. Actually, I think the quail was once of my favorites that night.   The service was excellent, our drinks were always full, and the food timing was perfect. We finished off with a shot of espresso and were off to enjoy the rest of our evening.  I have to remember to come back for  1/2 Price Bottles of Wine on Wednesday's!!

I'm a big, big fan of Wildflower. They are fast, fresh and delicious.  They have scrumptious bread, fresh salads and the soups are to die for. The BLT is my favorite,  thick bacon and "always fresh" avacado.  The Lobster Bisqe is the real deal with large chunks of meat in it. It's so good I eat it for breakfast.   This particular location has a great patio when the weather allows and the pandora stations they play only slightly suck. Indoors each booth has power outlets and people are always busy working away. How cool is that.   Yea it's corporate and a chain but lower your nose, it rocks.   The ice tea is amazing, I always buy a bag to brew at home. Delicious!

I've always gone for the guy with the great personality over the hottest guy in the room. This is what  La Cucina Italiana reminds me of. They opened in the location that used to be home to Spokes. While it is not a gorgeous spot, and the food needs some work, the attention to detail and ability to please well make up for it.   We had a very new server (2nd day on the job) and he really couldn't explain anything on the menu. I order the Gnocci, and the accompanying sauce was nothing as he described and it was extremely overdone (like mush).  When I brought it to his attention he apologized profusely and quickly brought me out a new dish, no questions asked. My second choice was the Pollo Picata and it was amazing. Chicken breasts glazed with a tangy lemon, butter, and caper sauce and served with creamy orzo and herbed oven roasted vegetables.  My friend had the chicken parmesan and it was served over penne (weird) but also pretty good. They serve a decently priced wine list and a wonderful complimentary antipasto plate to kick off the meal.    He may not be gorgeous, but he tries hard enough to keep me around. 3 stars!

I went to see my friends dad play here the other night and I had a great time. I was pleasantly surprised at the filet I ordered. I was expecting bar quality meat so I was blown away at the tender juicy filet on my plate covered in a delicious mushroom gravy. It was paired with instant mashed potatoes (boooo) and some veggies. My friends got the fish tacos and said they were delicious.  The band was awesome and our bartender was super cute and very friendly.   I will definitely be back.

I'm a bit late to the party on the this as I just heard about Stan's last week. Being a 13 year Mill rat veteran I am always excited when we have new lunch time options. Went with a coworker around noon on a Thursday and we were greeted when we entered and promptly seated. I was impressed with the menu, breakfast all day?! Hurray! I would have loved this when I was in college.   Being lunch time I flipped to the sandwich part of the menu  and ordered Karsten's Traditional Favorite ($9.50), a turkey breast with cranberry and stuffing on rye. Holy Thanksgiving this sammy was delicious. I could have ate a pound of the stuffing alone. Did I mention this thing was humongous?   Our waitress was friendly and fast, dropping our check off and getting us out the door I about 45 minutes. I hope Stan's sticks around because there were about 5 other delicious looking dishes I can't wait to try. I'm going with 4 stars, great food, huge variety of choices, prompt service. Doesn't get much better for a fast lunch in Tempe.

Boutique Solie is an absolutely fabulous store ladies! The owner Beth really has an eye for fashion and the inventory changes on a daily basis so you can always find something new.   The last time I was in I almost wrestled this gorgeous green dress from my girlfriend who spotted it first. The prices are spot on and the variety of jewelry, bags, clothing and shoes is unique and fashion forward. Many of the clothing lines are eco-friendly so you can feel good about your retail therapy.   Beth also does spray tans in the store and they are cruelty free.  Being fashionable and conscientious is the idea behind Boutique Solie, and the idea is carried out well. Whether you are looking for a weekend wardrobe or wanting to get some instant color this should be your new "go to" spot. You can thank me later.

Now open for lunch!  Previously I had only been here to meet friends for happy hour, and they have an EXCELLENT tequila selection.  They have expanded the patio just in time to take advantage of our gorgeous weather.   I got the Pibil pork tacos served with a habanero mango salsa, they were sweet, spicy and delicious. Three to an order for eight bucks, and it was the perfect amount of food. I was in and out in under 40 minutes. I think this may be a new "go to" spot for lunch.

I was pretty excited to try Beckett's and I have been back 4 times in 2 months so I consider myself a devoted fan. They did an excellent job of remodeling the old place (whose name we shall not mention). And no matter how busy they are I have never had a wait for a table.    Here's the breakdown of what I have tried:  Grilled cheese with pancetta and roasted red pepper tomato soup - 3 stars  Rock shrimp, corn and butternut squash enchiladas in a guajillo sauce - 3 stars  Short ribs, mashed potatoes, green beans, red wine reduction - 4 star (when they say fork tender they mean it and the reduction is amazing)  Brussels sprouts, pancetta and manchego, in a lemon thyme vinaigrette - 5 Gazillion Stars, best I've had in a restaurant.  And to top it all off (Damn you Georgie S.) chocolate dipped bacon s'mores - They come on a plate with  caramel, marshmallow creme,  peanut butter, and a graham cracker- 4 stars   The patio will be a nice place to hang out when the weather gets a bit warmer, and one day I may even go back and try a cocktail.

I have now been to Beckett's 7 times and not once have I left disappointed. The lay out is amazing, the patio is awesome, the bar staff always has new creations of temptation..  I didn't think anything could top the brussel sprouts, but then I tried the beets. Sweet Jesus I love this place.

Beckett's continues to delight and amaze me. Favorites are still the grilled cheese and the short ribs, I would give my first born for the seasonal roasted vegetables.  I never make reservations and always get a table within 15 minutes. Wonderful wine list, excellent cocktails. This place does it right.

I have always had allergies, they come on around March and don't leave until about June. This year they got so bad I got a sinus infection because of them. I called my pcp and she couldn't fit me in for 7 days.. I was in pain and didn't want to wait to get in to the doctor, so I sought out the Minute Clinic.   My experience was superb. I didn't have to make an appointment and I was in to see the nurse in about 35 minutes. She diagnosed my symptoms, wrote me a prescription and I was on my way in under an hour. She also suggested non prescription remedies (nasal flushes, saline rinses ect.) which I always appreciate.   She was able to email my prescription to the CVS by my work, so by the time I stopped in to the drive through they were ready.   I was so impressed by the speed and level of care I received I can't imagine waiting around to get in to see my pcp.. I am now a huge fan of the Minute Clinic and will always go there first for minor illnesses.

(To the owner of Fuego Tacos: I am so sorry for doing this because I LOVE Fuego Bistro, it is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!)   I don't see this place lasting very long. Both times I have been here it has been pretty dead. The trance techno was blazing loud and the club atmosphere did not make for a enjoyable dining experience.  I ordered the pernil asado and the short ribs barbacoa tacos. While Fuego Bistro has both on their menu, there must have been something lost in the translation at this location.   In addition to the teeny tiny portions of meat on my tacos, they were covered in a pound of cheese. The menu boasts an oaxacan cheese blend, I was expecting a light sprinkle, but instead I was given a pound of cold cheese.  The chips were also stale, the only saving grace was the salsa, which was pretty delectable. I was underwhelmed with both the atmosphere and food. Perhaps if you are just dropping in for a quick bite between bars this is a go to spot, but for a sit down leisurely meal I would go elsewhere.

Tryst is a great spot for breakfast/brunch. I love their sweet potato tots, veggie omelets and thick applewood bacon. They also do a mean bloody mary and boast an amazing Organic Liquor section. I need to go back during the evening to check out their flavored vodkas.  My boyfriend has not been so lucky, he has had to send food back twice. The first time it was for a steak that was brought out bloody when he ordered it medium rare. The second time was ridiculous, he ordered eggs over hard and they came out runny, he sent them back and they came back BLACK. I didn't think it was possible to burn and egg like that.  So 3.5 stars for Tryst as long as you don't piss off the cook!

Perhaps if I were "hammered" I would have enjoyed this meal better... I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot. I ordered take-out on a Sunday, and when I arrived I felt something was off right away. The place was dead... Not one person in the gigantic dining room, only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored. The bar however was pretty lively, maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food.   Ribs - all char and fat, barely any meat and extremely overcooked Pulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of grease The sides, corn (half a cob is considered a side for two??) Cheese grits, worst I have ever tried, dry and flavorless Cornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry sponge BBQ Sauce - disappointing at best, watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides). Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on top  I really don't like writing scathing reviews, but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal. There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix, this is not one.

I don't know if Dodey's is seedy enough to be classified as a dive bar, but I can say CHEAP ASS DRINKS!~  There are lots of fun things to do like playing pool or darts, or simply staring  at the chicks in lingerie behind the bar. (You guys know who you are).  Dodey really knows how to light up a room and make everyone feel special and glad they came. Watch out for her though, she has been known to walk around shouting "Vodka shot for your beer?" and that can be downright dangerous.   I'm not going to blow the secret on the newbie initiation but it is hilarious to watch and fun to partake in. If you are in the neighborhood I highly recommend stopping in for a pint. Just don't blame me if you end up taking a cab home.

Quite possibly the best street style fish taco I have had in Phoenix. The generous portion of fish was heavily seasoned and lightly breaded, the result was pure heaven. I also ordered the flour quesadilla, refried pinto beans, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The refried beans were creamy and the queso in the quesadilla was awesome.   I washed that all down with a bottled coke and rolled myself home. You may want to give yourself some time if you come here during lunch, by 11:30 the line was out the door. Apparently I am not the only one that knows how delicious this little dive is!

I fell in love with Rice Paper the minute I walked in. It is a small historic house converted in to a quaint and hip dining area. There is a large patio in back that I am sure will be heavily used come cooler weather.  Our servers name was Derek and he was funny, attentive and personable even though the place was packed.   The food was amazing, and to name a few favorites:  Firecracker Shrimp - Lightly breaded and tossed in a spicy aioli sauce Enlighten Me Roll - Tofu, asparagus, jalapenos, jicama, crispy rolls, and sriracha served with peanut hoisin sauce Shaking Beef - Holy deliciousness! Fillet mignon seared with soy, garlic, and onions served sizzling with steamed rice that was topped with mushrooms (see pics). Curry Tofu - Tofu, asparagus, shitake mushrooms, baby corn, and onions. We ordered it spicy and it was phenomenal.  I also had the Ginger Fizz drink and it was pretty tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the pho!~

I had a great overall experience at Studio B smiles. The staff was friendly and attentive  throughout the entire process.    The receptionist provided information and told me her personal experience, the tech was gentle and fast, and Dr. Badolato had a great personality and made me feel very comfortable.   They provided blankets and gave me a choice of movies to watch.  I would recommend this great team of professionals to anyone looking to get dental work done.

I haven't reviewed The Windsor yet? Shame on me!  Before you enter, be very careful where you park. Pay attention to the signs in the residential streets, you will get ticketed. I almost always valet as I am impatient and lazy.  The architecture is similar to Postinos, it has that old- wood-modern-minimal-rustic-charm feeling. The patio outside rocks, if weather allows sit outside.   The food is wonderful. My favorite is the Bahn Mi fish sandwich, second favorite is the ribs, and of course the 5000 calorie porkwich is also delectable. The Vegetable Chop and Mixed Grain salads are wonderful and so is the Burger (order it Windsor style, trust me)..   The bartenders are friendly, the drinks are stiff and the wine list is hefty. This has become one of my Cen Pho Favorite Spots.

Best ice cream in the valley. My last meal on earth would be the butter pecan ice cream in a pretzel cone. It is just that good.  Sure there is a huge menu with lots of great combinations (sundaes and other mixes) and they carry old-fashioned candy, but the butter pecan will keep me coming back and back and back and back...

Turtle Treasure's is awesome! I recently consigned a few things with them and the process was easy breezy. They came to my house and picked up my items and less than a month later I received a check in the mail for $99.50 for a desk that sold. Consignment doesn't get much easier than that, especially for furniture.   The selection of furniture and antiques is always changing so this is definitely a store worth checking out.

The Crescent Ballroom is one of the best concert venues in Phoenix. The set up is great, you walk in to a nice modern dining area where you can have pre-drinks and food before entering in to the actual venue.   The Ballroom itself is small, but well set up with stadium seating along the walls. The  under 21 area is also small and doesn't take away from the viewing pleasure of all the drunkards like some other places.   I have yet to try the food, but they do $5 beer and burritos on Fridays and I have heard rave reviews. This place rocks and I hope it stays this way. We need more venues like this in Phoenix!

This place is awesome and fast which is a big bonus for the Mill lunch crowd. I ordered at the counter and had my food within 10 minutes. The tropical Iced Tea was delicious and so was my salad. I ordered the Chop, it had arugula, cranberries, corn, feta, red pepper, chicken and couscous (loved the couscous) and a slightly sweet and creamy basil pesto dressing.  I felt so good about my healthy lunch I splurged and split a chocolate cupcake with Georgie. It was moist and not overly sweet, I detected a faint hint of coffee in the icing.   I will definately be back..

Bravo Timo! Well done.   I loved Bomberos and Timo has moved in to the beautiful spot and went easy on the remodeling.. If it ain't broke don't fix it! The patio was left intact and is gorgeous. I would recommend this for groups or for a romantic dinner for two. When it is cold the fire pit is awesome and it is quaint and charming.   The inside is cozy and well designed, I usually opt to sit at the bar so I can watch them prepare my food and slide it in to the wood fired oven.  I went for brunch last week and it was awesome (see pics).  I had the benedict with avocado, tomato, black truffle, prosciutto and hollandaise  and it was simply divine!  I could not leave without trying the grapefruit brulee, equally scrumptious.  I can't wait to go back for dinner. They have a bottle of wine and a flatbread for $20 on Mondays!

I've been to North a few times in the past month. I really like the open air feeling of the restaurant. It is amazing that this cute Italian farm house used to be an old car wash.   The staff is pretty awesome and I have always enjoyed the food. Last time for breakfast I had the egg scramble, it was a beautiful surprise of fluffy eggs hugging asparagus and peas. I devoured the entire thing.    The happy hour is amazing, it is Monday-Friday 3-6 PM and All-Day Sunday. Last time for happy hour I got the $2 spicy nuts, $2 green olives and $5 chardonnay. Can't beat that.. I have to hand it to Sam Fox, he's scored again.

Hands down the best facial I have ever had. I could have laid on the table and let Tifanny's magic fingers caress my face all day. She really takes the time to get to know your skin and creates a custom facial based on your needs.   Her product line is phenomenal and the facial left my skin glowing for weeks.  She also does peels and microdermabrasion and I am eager to go back and try both.   What really sets her apart from most estheticians is her attention to detail. Her studio is gorgeous and the environment she has created exudes comfort and relaxation. I have never felt so at ease and calm while someone cleaned out my dirty pores.   If you are in the mood for pampering treat yourself and go see Tiffany. You will be so happy you did~

I like this La Fitness. It is clean and fairly new, the machines always work and the waits are non-existent. Perhaps I just go at the right times but I have never had to wait for a machine.  They offer a variety of classes (although I wish there was more kick-boxing) and they have a 4:30 time slot which I love.  If your worried about theft lock your stuff up! This happens at all gyms so be smart about your belongings.

It was a beautiful day in Chandler for a BBQ Festival. I was immediately impressed that the parking was free and the walk was quite short to get in to the gates. Admission was only $10 bucks and drink tickets were reasonable.   There were an amazingly diverse amount of BBQ vendors and the lines were not overly long.  I would go back again next year as sitting in the grass slugging down ribs and beers is my kind of afternoon.

A magnificent complete auto detail shop and the results are over-the-top excellent! Ryan does a great job and was just as thorough with my old Honda as he was with the brand new beamer in the shop.   I would highly recommend this business to anyone wanting quality work, on time efficiency, and a service worth raving about!

I've been to Del Frisco's several times prior to seeing a movie at the Esplanade. They servers are great and they are always very conscience of your time crunch.   Last time I visited I enjoyed the Build-Your-Own Bloody Mary Bar. You can't go wrong with Tito's vodka and they bring all sorts of fixins (bacon, limes, olives, salts, tobasco ect) to customize your cocktail. My other go to dishes are the deviled eggs, (it's the truffle-chive vinaigrette that makes this dish) and the flatbreads.    I would recommend this a great spot for pre-movie snacks or a good brunch.

Crudo, Crudo how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:  Butterfish with lardo and lemon Albacore with truffles, apples and black garlic Squid Ink Risotto Pork Belly enough said Short Rib with root veggies  Each dish was amazing, an orgasm for the tongue. I didn't want it to end. I could have stayed and ate for hours. Charming building, awesome set up... And the cocktails, ohhhh the cocktails. The modest monk and daring dutchman were crafted to perfection.   Cullen Campbell has done it again and having Micah Olson behind the bar was a brilliant combination. This place is a "must try" and reservations are recommended. Last time I was there I forgot to make them and the wait was over an hour (and worth every minute).

Hi fives to Kimpton and Hotel Palomar for bringing The Blue Hound to downtown!  I have finally found a spot (without having to drive to Scottsdale)  where I can get a truly wonderful Old Fashioned with a large block ice cube.  The décor is awesome, hip and elegant with beautiful lighting.  They have a very long wooden bar that I haven't been able to move past so I can't really comment on the dining room.   I am not sure why everyone keeps mentioning small portions... I have had several dishes and I didn't think they were small. Quite frankly I think Americans are overfed and used to large portions that could easily feed 3 people from one plate. Either way I ordered the ham steak and eggs and my friend got the KFC Sandwich and they were both HUMONGOUS!  In fact the ham steak  was the size of the entire plate! We both ended up taking half our meal home. I have also tried the flatbreads, the tots, the deviled eggs... All unique, distinct and palate pleasing.   They do a great happy hour and the bartenders are awesome. This is my new favorite spot in Cityscape.

A spot with eggs on Mill yippee!!!! I ordered the $5 burrito, it came with eggs, red potatoes, avocado and cheese. It was mixed perfectly. (I hate getting burritos where they are not mixed well  and one bite is egg, the next bite is cheese...)... I got a side of salsa which was very good and a tad spicy.   The place is great to grab something to go, but don't bring a group as there is only counter seating.   Coffee was decent too!

First off I have never had my bag checked when shopping here, I kinda wish I had though, I would probably feel a bit cooler. Living the thug life G!  Ok, ok focus. Priceless is great. Remember you get what you pay for, and you don't pay much for the clothes here. They are cheap and cute and the store is huge so I have never left empty handed. They also have a website so if you find something cute and they don't have your size you can always order it online.   I've gotten 2 dresses and a jacket here and I get tons of compliments each time I have worn them. And each piece was under $30 bucks. Boooya.

This place was great. We stopped in for lunch and the word is out because the place was packed. The ice tea was great and I loved being able to chose a half sandwich and a half potato. They were both huge and I couldn't finish. I got the club sandwich and while hard to eat because of its size the ingredients were fresh and I really liked the Russian mustard. My spud was good too, I got the cheese and chicken one and it really hit the spot.  I would try to avoid this place during prime time lunch rush (12-2:00pm) as it took a while to get our food, but it was worth the wait.  You get a free cookie when you check in!

I originally liked the Handlebar for their great selection of beers and 1/2 priced apps on happy hour. My work group has been there several times for happy hour and the patio is great for accommodating big groups. The roll up walls are nice when the weather is cool creating one open space so the inside and outside flow together.   I went back for lunch the other day and all I can say is "QUINOA BURGER!" I can't believe how delicious it was, packed with Cheddar Cheese, Carrots, Zucchini, Feta, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Cucumber Dill Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Of course I added bacon to enhance the experience so it definitely wasn't a vegetarian option.   I'm adding Handlebar to my regular rotation for Mill Ave lunches.

I knew I was in trouble when I saw they were opening up a Rack in Town and Country. I stopped in on Saturday and came out two hours later with enough to fill the trunk of my car. I couldn't get over how clean and well structured this store is. Perhaps because it has only been open for a few weeks, but it was well organized and not rifled through like most other Racks. Now I have yet another store within walking distance to fuel my shoe addiction. I found a pair of Vince Camuto's in  the clearance section for $80!   My man also had a lot of luck, he was able to find a pair of Seven Jeans, 2 sweaters and some CC undies (that fit his 6'6 frame).  I can already tell I am going to have to put myself on an allowance because I drool every time I drive by the store.

Bravo to Craig DeMarco and his partners in Upward Projects as they have done it again!  I was lucky enough to be able to attend the soft opening last week for their newest concept: awesome wood fired pizza.    The remodeled First Federal Savings & Loan building has been transformed in to a modern upscale pizzeria. There's even a pick-up window in place of the bank's old drive-thru lane. (Very, very cool).  The pizza was amazing and the ingredients are fresh and creative (think beets and brussell sprouts). I was also impressed with the wine list and very happy to see local az wines on the menu.  The entire menu of beer and wine can be ordered to go so you can enjoy them at home.    I can't wait to update this review as I work my way through the menu.

I am no longer a fan of The Yard. The valet parking is a major issue, it fills up and then you have to park across the street and play frogger trying to make it back across 7th st. The drinks are overpriced as is the food and the place is always filled with kids. I don't go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children running at my feet. I love children, and if I was going to Peter Piper I would expect the raucous. Unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advantage of the fun games they offer (ping pong, corn hole and shuffleboard).   Perhaps I go too early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table. No thanks. (But yes I will probably still go there because I can ride my bike when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio).

La Fitness in general is a decent gym, nothing amazing but a good chain gym. I like it because my offer is for any gym in AZ so I have tons of options no matter where I am in the city.   This location seems to have an issue with the staff instructors for their classes. Three times I have shown up for Zumba and waited for an instructor that never shows. That is frustrating and has happened at the Northern gym as well.   The equipment is in decent shape and they keep it pretty clean. I just signed my boyfriend up for the family rate and no one hassled him to add personal training session.   I will keep coming back because it is close to my house. I just wish they would sort out the class schedules/instructors.

Congratulations to D'Lisa and the staff at Salon D'Shayn!  The new location is gorgeous and hip and the service is top notch. I had the pleasure of getting gel nails done by Vanessa yesterday and I was ecstatic with the way my accent foils turned out. Ladies if you haven't tried the new foil nails yet you are missing out, they are so cool!  I am so happy to see another local business flourishing in the old My Florist location. D'Lisa is a master waxer and it is awesome to see her bringing her talents and crew to downtown Phoenix. The salon is full service (including a barber for the fellows) and you get a discount on your first visit. Look no further for your grooming needs.  My only regret was that I was pressed for time and did not have a chance top  to stop in to Botique Solie to get my fashion fix. I may have to stop in today to scoop up the cute top I saw in the window.

I don't know what I was thinking, call it temporary insanity. I have colored my roots for years but for some crazy reason I thought it a good idea to dye the whole thing. What was supposed to be a light brown turned the bottom of my hair black. Frantically I washed with clarifying shampoo, over and over and over - this dye was not coming out.   I finally picked up the phone and called D'Shayn and explained what I had done. I got in to see Karla and she saved the day and my hair. I was nervous that getting a color correction would damage my hair, but that was not the case. Karla did an amazing job restoring my hair back to a normal color and it actually feels healthier now than when I went in.  If you make a horrendous mistake and need a superwoman rescue go see Karla, she is fantastic. She is probably pretty wonderful with color in general and I know I will be back for my future coloring needs. 5 stars!!

I continue to love, love, love this salon. It is pretty much my one stop shop for all things in my beautification routine. Waxing, facials, nails, beautiful color. Done and done. I'm going to see Karla tomorrow to freshen up my roots and once again praise her for the gorgeous color and life she has sprung back in to my hair.   Thanks again D'Lisa for providing such an amazing place to cover all my beauty needs. This salon rocks and the people who work here are fantastic.

I am officially a Dropout.   This  Fox Restaurant is HUMONGOUS! The transformation of the old motorcycle shop was perfectly executed (see pics). The Dropout bar is big and gorgeous, the inside gives you full view of the kitchen and the awesome preps working behind the counter. I had the mussels with garlic, wine, sundried tomatoes and sausage. It came with grilled toast that I used as a sponge to soak up the delicious sauce. Roberto my splendid server/bartender told me they came from Washington and they are grown in under a year which accounts for the thick succulent meat and paper thin shell. My only critique is that they should serve them in a bowl instead of a platter so the mussels can soak in the broth and  not get cold.    The Yard is equally awesome. They have pig in a hole, ping pong, bocce ball and  shuffle board. I can see myself spending many an afternoon here with mimosas in hand. Apparently it will also function as a live music venue and with the space and set up I can imagine it rockin.  They haven't started happy hour yet which was a bit disappointing. 4 drinks and a shared app came in at about $60 bucks which was a bit pricey. I love blowing all my funds on food and booze though so I'm sure I'll be back this weekend.

Wow, where do I begin? I think this was by far the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. I came with a group of 8 for lunch at 11am on a Wednesday. We had stopped by earlier in the day and made a reservation and we were looking forward to trying a new spot.  Our waitress (Liz I believe) was the only redeeming part of the entire incident that followed. (If I was rating her I would give 5 stars). Our food orders took an eternity and we watched all the people who had came in after us getting their food. Our waitress stopped by to warn us about the wait on the food, so we ordered some chips to tide us over.   I ordered the Veggie Rice bowl (which was described as mixed peppers, squash onions, ect and either rice or pasta) I asked for no rice add  the Vegan Carne Asada.  What was brought out came in a to-go container that was about 1/4 full (think typical Chinese food container). I thought perhaps it was the side of carne and inquired with the waitress to see where the rest of the bowl was. (Where was the pasta, grilled veggies ect?) Did someone get hungry and eat it on the way to my table?  She came back with some guy who looked in need of a shower. He asked me what the problem was, and when I explained there was nothing here but the carne asada  he got defensive and argued with me. There was no offer to bring the pasta, or add veggies. He basically beat on his chest, pushed a menu in my face and told me he was the executive chef "Joey" and that he would never order a rice bowl without the rice. I was astounded at his aggression and rudeness. If I owned this joint he would be out of a job. This is no "House of Tricks" buddy, it's a bar that plays lunch spot by day and your pompous attitude earns no merit badge.  Some other highly medicated looking guy came by later and asked me what the problem was and basically chuckled when I told him and asked if he could do anything. I was afraid the "executive chef" Joey would spit in my food so I declined, I couldn't get out of that place fast enough. Liz apologized and you could tell she honestly felt bad about the exchange.   I will never come back to this place and I'll  tell everyone I know to avoid it. I've worked on Mill 15 years and have seen hundreds of restaurants fail over the years, I know this one won't last. Not with the absolute insolence and discourtesy they assault their customers with.   (And they charge $5 bucks for chips and salsa - GET REAL)!

The Spoke and Wheel has become my new neighborhood hangout. They offer a great happy hour with $5 cocktails, wines and beers and pretty tasty eats. A few of my favorites are the Breakdancer drink and the grilled jalapenos wrapped in bacon (everything is better wrapped in bacon). I brought my grandmother here for lunch and she raved over her chicken sandwich. I had a burger and it well done (as I requested) and the avocado was fresh and creamy.  They have an enormous patio and the service has always been great, they remember my name and drink and are always friendly and fun to chat with .  If you ride your bike (as we often do) they give you happy hour prices all day. Way to support the locals!

I've been to Otro a few times now and I have always received excellent service. I've sat at the bar, in the dining room and most recently on the patio. Every time the server has been friendly and attentive. Way to go Otro! In the same vein of Gallo Blano the tortas and tacos are excellent I don't have a favorite, I love them all.   On my last visit I had the carne asada burrito and it was HUGE, I washed it down with a $4 Negro Modello and left full and happy. Ole!~

North Mountain is a great little brewery. The selection of beers is wide and wonderful. The NM burger is delicious and the only thing wrong with the mussels is that there are never enough. The white wine garlic butter sauce they swim in is the perfect dip for the sour dough bread.  They have a decent size patio and often have bands playing inside. This is a great addition to the Sunny Slope area.

I must say I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the miso broth pork bowl and it was lacking in flavor. I got the normal pork, not the pork belly and it was quite fatty.   A flavorless greasy bowl for $10 bucks will not entice me for a return visit.

Great Wednesday special - half off all bottles of wine.  Enjoyed the ham and fig and took home the salccicia.  The place was empty at 6:00pm, but the service was top notch.  I will definitely be back for their great happy hour and delicious pizzas.

Located in CityScape downtown Squid Ink has a killer happy hour.   Perusing through the menu I found much to my delight! The philly roll and the spicy salmon roll were fresh and small. I prefer small rolls, the kind you can actually fit in your mouth and not have to awkwardly bite in half with chop sticks. I also had the green bean tempura, and the chicken wings which are chargrilled, bathed in siracha and served with shiso ranch. The star of the show was the miso black cod, pan seared and served with leeks, the miso glaze was intoxicating.   I couldn't believe how cheap the dinner and 2 sake bombers turned out to be.   DID I MENTION HAPPY HOUR IS EVERY DAY UNTIL 7!!

We went to Bootleggers after being teased by the picture of the bloody mary with the mini slider on top. We drove up on a Saturday and were disappointed to learn they only serve those on Sunday's.   We opted for the regular bloody mary and the mixture was so spicy I could barely finish it. That was disappointing because it will probably sway me away from ordering it on a Sunday.   I saw bacon board on the menu and could not talk myself out of ordering it. It was delicious! It was a carefully curated collection of the finest all-natural swine slabs served with w/griddled toast, sweet onion jam, house yellow mustard and house brined pickles. The sweet cherry and the jalapeno were my favorite. I balanced that out with the kale salad and it was equally good.   I will definitely return as it is a local spot with friendly staff, I just may not get the bloody mary.

Yelp rarely steers me wrong, but this time it happened. I ordered take-out and was so disappointed. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The crab puffs were some of the worst I have had, weak and soggy with no crab. The mu shu chicken lacked flavor and I honestly think they used tortillas instead of crepes (I couldn't taste any sesame oil).   The pricing was a bit high and the place was a dump. I'll stick to China Chili in the future.

I picked up the ChopShop to go (after hearing about the long lines) and I was glad I did. When I went to get my food the line was out the door. The pick-up spot was easy to get to and my order was ready when I arrived.   I ordered the steak bowl with sweet potato hash and it came with the standard veggies broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot and mushroom. It was tasty but the soy-sesame sauce was a tad sweet so I would go lighter the next time. I also tried some of the shrimp bowl with brown rice, it was packed with fresh green onions and red chili sauce. I added on two simple salads with a mustard a vinegrette. All in all I was pleased with the freshness of the food and both protein bowls reheated well.   2 bowls and 2 salads for 26 bucks  - I'll be back.

This salon is very clean and they have nice new massage chairs. Each time I have been in I have noticed several regulars chatting it up with the girls and that is always a good sign. I've never had to wait long even though they are always pretty busy.  Go see Ranae! She is now my go to girl to get my nails done. She is thorough but quick and she gives a great pedicure.  Extra bonus! They give you a short neck/shoulder massage at the end.

These brothers own the ONLY mobile flatbread pizza truck in Phoenix. They do pizza right boasting local ingredients and creative menus to tempt the tastebuds of everyone around. Think local pork belly bacon from The Meat Shop, Saffron JAK house turkey sausage, local cheese and uncured pepperoni from California-based company Zoe's Meats.   Some of my favorite menu items are the Mexican squash, black bean, potato, feta and cheddar cheese with tapatio and the Basil, mozzrella and beef steak tomato. Then of course there is the jalapeno, bacon, pineapple chutney or perhaps the pear, gorgonzola, prosciutto, apricot jam and mozzarella.... Are you getting the picture, there are too many great options to love just one.   You can find these guys slinging their deliciousness all over Phoenix, in the morning at  3rd ave and Osborn and some evenings at Kobalt Bar at Park Central Mall.   If your mouth isn't watering wait until you get 20 feet from their truck.. The smells alone will get you running.   I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.

The Filmore Vig is a great spot for meeting groups and hanging out downtown. They do brunch with unlimited mimosas (that can be dangerous), and a bloody mary bar. The patio is big and there is always seating around the bar or on one of the big lawn tables.   The servers are friendly and quick to clean up the tables. The happy hour food (especially the hummus, wings and sliders) are a must try. They valet, which is nice because it is hard to find parking downtown.  Uptown still holds my heart, but this is a close second.

If you are lucky enough to find a seat at this cozy, vintage little gem you will never want to leave. This is an awesome happy hour spot with great wines and craft beer. The bartender/owner is friendly, funny and very knowledgeable about his pours. (And shares my father's name - hey Greg Allen!!)! They serve baked good, treats, cheese plates and other nosh items.   It truly is a neighbor bar because I run in to people I know every time I come in. Do me a favor and don't tell your friends about this place. It's almost too cool to share

For fast food Chick-Fil-A is awesome. I never feel over guilty when I eat it and it helps that it is across the street from my office... Or maybe it doesn't help because I go here more than I care to admit. Here are a few reasons why:  -The ice tea is fresh brewed and delicious -The grilled market salad is only 330 calories (with dressing) and has fresh fruit and nuts and on top with grilled chicken -The 8 count nuggets are only 270 calories (don't' think about the fat) and so darn good -You can order ahead and pick it up inside skipping the line  They are fast and friendly and the place is always clean!

I walked in to Biscuit's Café after discovering Boston's had closed.  For an order at the counter place I was really impressed with the quality of the food and the attention to detail. The portions are HUGE, I order the  1/2 sandwich and soup and could barely finish it. The second time I did  1/2 sandwich and a side and had the same experience.  The bacon and turkey on the sandwich each time was delicious. The meals were served with a pickle, a pepperocini AND a chocolate covered strawberry. If you order the special of the day you also get a chocolate chip cookie the size of your face.   Lunch was served fast and they have tropical China Mist Tea. I will be adding Biscuit's Café to my regular lunch rotation!  Oh yeah, join the FREE rewards club for all sorts of free stuff!

The Clever Koi is a modern take on traditional Asian cuisine. They serve wonderful noodle dishes, steamed buns and house made dumplings. They also have an interesting and exciting mix of hand crafted cocktails. It has a comfortable modern setting with a nice long bar and expansive patio that faces Central.   We stopped in for happy hour the other day and were pleasantly surprised with the prices and variety of cocktails and eats. We started with the beets, they came with cucumber, pickeled ginger, bean curd and a lemongrass vinaigrette. It was beautifully plated, but the amount of soy was so overwhelming it was difficult to eat(and the beets weren't completely ripe). For the noodle bowl we tried the roasted pork, it came with bacon, mustard greens, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms and a soft egg. It was delicious. I had to try the steamed buns and went for the squid sausage that the bartender recommended. It was amazing and I loved the aioli it was dressed in.  I had "The Enabler" which was hickory whiskey, grilled lemon juice, burlesque bitters. It had a slow smoke flavor that stayed in my mouth long after the drink was done.  The bartenders were awesome, we had a great experience and will definitely be back.

Oh Henry! I have such a love hate relationship with you. I love the big bright airy indoor areas, but hate that you are always so busy I can't get a seat without a reservation. I am a huge fan of your happy hour but I have to dance around like some big vulture hawk in order to get a seat at the bar.   Your food is wonderful. Shirt rib anything, I've both the pot stickers and the short ribs and each time ended up ordering another round. The chopped salad is what you would expect (turkey, ham, egg, bacon, white cheddar, tomato) but the fat-e-o buttermilk dressing is deceivingly light and creamy tasting.  The fat-e-o buttermilk fried chicken sandwich should be taken off the menu so I could restrain myself from pigging out on it every time. They fry the breast and then slather it in havarti cheese & bbq mayonnaise.  Help me now! Next time I will jog from my house to make all those calories make sense (and I live far)!

I have never been to El Hefe at night, only for lunch or early happy hours so my review is for the food an ambiance during the daytime. I come here often for lunch, they have great street tacos, salsas and quesadillas. The happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm. Taco Tuesdays have $2 tacos and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.   While I can't speak to the night time atmosphere this is a great spot to grab lunch or happy hour on Mill.

I've been to Joyride a few times now and Upward has done it again. They have built a little Monopoly in my hood and I couldn't be happier. Both times I have been here I rode my bike, they have ample bike parking and a big patio.  The bar is gorgeous with the stained glass vases and the concept of the restaurant is very laid back and open. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time here when I can pull myself away from the Windsor.   I also love that they honor the Upward tradition of $5 till $5 on pitchers and wine.   The tacos are street style and with so many street style tacos shop these days it is hard to find something phenomenal on the menu. That being said though everything I tried was very good. The carne, the nachos and the salsa will all keep me coming back for more.   I'd love to see them do brunch!

Located near CityScape in the renovated old Luhrs building sits Bitter and Twisted. The ambiance of the space is superb and the rules you have to abide by only improve it. No reservations, no standing at the bar and no whining. If you don't like the rules go somewhere else.  I have never had a problem finding a spot but I probably go at slower times. I've sat at the bar and flipped through the drink magazine, yes it is intimidating at first but once you get used to it you'll be taken on an adventure. I've tried alcohols and mixers I normally would have stayed away from. Thanks B&T. I must say the Lemongrass Tom Collins is one of the best damn drinks I have tried in ages.  The food is great too, try the loaded fries and the popcorn. You can thank me later.

Johnny Chu does not disappoint when it comes to creating hip atmospheres and delicious food. I was excited when Red Thai opened as it is close to my house, and I know he always does great happy hour specials. I have been here a few times now and some of my favorites are the truffled edamae, chicken lollipops with black peper sauce, wings and the house dynamite.  They have great martinis and asahi on draft.   Did I mention they have happy hour every day!!! There is a long bar that runs the length of the resturaunt so finding a seat has never been difficult. They have never been very busy when I have been in, but hopefully as they age that will change. Also I cannot to try Shabu Fondue when it opens next door.

Both times I have visited Shabu I left full and happy. This hot pot idea is great for groups as everyone can sample and share their way through the menu. Last time we ordered the ying yang pot (choice of 2 broths) with the lemon grass and house spicy. I loved the lemongrass but they were not joking around with the red chilies in the house spicy. Some of my favorite things to throw in the pot:  Baby bok choy Dumplings Oyster mushrooms Oval noodles Shabu beef Scallops  The service has always been fast and friendly with the server filling up our broth consistently throughout the night. The interior is typical cool Johnny Chu with anime running in the backgound on the other side. Stop in and give this place a try. The unique concept shouldn't be missed!

I will admit the first time I was told I was going to Top Golf I wasn't very excited. I am not a golfer and don't usually enjoy sport themed evenings. I rejoiced when our birthday party of 12 called for a reservation and was told it was a 3 hour wait.   The second time I was told I was going to Top Gold I knew I wasn't getting out of it. We were going for a corporate team builder and had about 25 people in our group. Once we arrived I was amazed at the size of the place and that it was packed full on a Tuesday night. There are 3 stories of bays (private couch areas that fit about 6 people). The bays come stocked with both male and female clubs and a screen similar to a bowling set up where you can enter in your names and select the games you want to play.  I will admit when I am wrong, I had a blast! The service was awesome, we had someone come over and explain how to play and we quickly ordered cocktails and got started. The server kept everyone on a separate tab which made paying the bill at the end of the night a breeze.  The food was not bad, we did buffet style fajitas with rice and beans. It wasn't the most flavorful but pretty decent for a buffet and the focus here isn't really on the food.   I didn't score the highest but I had a fun time trying. Even if you are not a golf fan I would recommend this as a fun outing for large groups.

Niza is amazing. You can tell how long he has been doing hair by his skill level and quickness. He has transformed me from a dried out baliage to a beautiful red and then to a deep, dark brown.   I love his cuts and he is enjoyable to sit with while you process. I am so happy to have finally found another superstar to care for my tresses!

Stopped in for happy hour the other day to try the latest edition to the street taco crazy taking over Phoenix.  The place is small but well decorated and cozy and I loved the lighting at the bar.   We split the street tacos which were only $1.50 during happy hour! What really set them a part were all the sala choices. I picked 6, my favorites were the roasted corn, chipotle and avacado crema. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of them on the menu. The coronas were still around 5 bucks on happy hour which was pretty high, but they did have house margaritas and wines for $5.  I will be back

I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and chef Kelly's creations so it is no wonder the Revival was a big hit. I was sad to see Mucho Gusto go but the great location and beautiful patio spot will keep people coming in. Now first off this certainly wasn't the cheapest lunch but I dug into my pocket book a little deeper because it is well worth it.   A few of my favorites from the menu are the caesar salad with its spicy dressing and pumpkin seeds and the braised short rib sandwich with shallots and an apple cider slaw. The fig itabout it cocktail was wonderful. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try out one of the steaks.

Postino's in Tempe hurray!!!! I finally have a new spot for lunch that is absolutely divine!! The Tempe Annex is much like the layout of the Uptown version. It is bright and airy, nice patio with beautiful long bar. We came for lunch and I had the split special,  1/2 prosciutto and fig sandwich with the beet salad. It was as mouthwatering as expected and not bad with a $9.95 price tag.   The menu is the same as all the other Postino's and they still do the $5 wines and beers till 5 and the awesome special $20 for a board and wine on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8. I wish they had this location 10 years ago when I went to ASU!

I used Yelp to find a new happy hour spot the other day and was led to Ten. It is located in the Biltmore in what I believe was the old Fuego Tacos spot. I ordered an old fashion, which actually was not on the happy hour menu but that was my fault for not paying attention to the starred items. It was way too sweet for my taste, heavy on the sugar and not enough bitters. Next time I would try the cucumber gimlet.   I was eying the hush puppies on the table next to me and knew I had to give them a try, and they were delicious. They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and covered in bacon and blue cheese. The rouille sauce was creamy with a kick, just the perfect amount of spice. I could put that sauce on everything. I also go the shrimp and grit cakes but was a bit disappointed, the cake wasn't grits, it was a corn pancake, not what I expected but the sausage and shrimp were both really tasty as was the sauce it was served in.   This is a great spot to stop in for happy hour or maybe a quick bite before a movie. I can't wait to go back and try the fried green tomatoes.

Hurray! Another option for lunch on Mill. They have scrumptious pastries, handmade breads, soups, sandwiches, quiches... Went in the other day and had the  Turkey Brie Panini with apples and walnuts and a tropical iced tea.   My meal was great and so was our service. I have to go back to try one of the hand-dipped Bouchée chocolates especially knowing they are prepared on site by a chocolatier!

Tapacubo (located at the bottom of the Graduate Tempe hotel) has a nice vibe to it. There is an expansive bar indoors with plenty of seating, and booths surrounding the bar for additional seating for larger groups. From the inside you have a view of the small outdoor pool and the outdoor patio. It is light, bright and airy.   The menu was simple: apps, salad, tortas or tacos, I was a little disappointed with the limited options but again, it is in a hotel. I will say the salad I had was delicious, it was almost their version of a chopped salad (lettuce, tomato, picked onion, quinoa, corn, blueberries and delicious smoked chicken).   The drinks were reasonably priced and although the food took a while the server more than made up for it.

Revo is right off the light rail stop and looks pretty promising.  I came with a group of 6 for lunch. I ordered The Maverick - ham, pepperoni, salami, provolone and honey mustard. The "pizza bread" they server it on was delicious. It also came with a side salad which was a generous portion. You can build your own pizza and your own macaroni and cheese with any of the toppings they put on the pizza. I really enjoyed my lunch and took half of the sandwich home for the next day.   I don't know what the issue is with the salads but I have heard from several people they are not good. Too few topping or just really plain? Not sure but the Sammy was delicious. I'll be back.

The Uptown Vig is my Cheers and while I don't often stray I am glad I can continue to support Tucker in this new adventure. There are a lot of great things about the Linger Longer Lounge. They bartenders make a mean old fashion, I love it when those are done right and bonus points for having them on happy hour. I have been here a few times now but was waiting to try the food before writing a review.   I am pleased to say the food was great. The house salad I ordered was massive and fresh and the 12 inch pizza was perfect to share. I had 2 pizzas, the 78 (basically a margheritta) and the ZZ Top (bbq chicken) both were scrumptious. The zucchini fries were also a big hit. We sat outside and the weather was perfect.  The old pool room no longer stinks and it is now the game room. There was foosball, skeeball, darts and shuffleboard. This is a great place to eat, drink, play and be merry. I can see myself lingering here.   My only complaint is the front bar, it is lit from underneath and has a checkered design that makes you dizzy. I can't linger there, I have to go sit somewhere else or I start to feel drunk before I get my first cocktail.

Blasted Barley took the place of the Old Tavern and I'm so glad they did! The place has a great patio and they did some redesign so there is more seating both outside and in the front portion of the inside.   The menu feeds into my new obsession with chopped salads - they have 3 different kinds:  Smoked Cobb Chop  - house smoked turkey, roasted corn, chopped red pepper, bacon, avocado and blue-brie cheese on romaine with ranch and a fried egg  The Not-So-Original Chop - arugula, cous cous, marinated roma tomatoes, crunchy corn, currants and papitas. comes with choice of house smoked turkey or chopped avocado with creamy basil dressing.  Quinoa Chop  - arugula, quinoa, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, papitas, currants, and parmesan cheese tossed with truffle oil dressing  I went with the Not-So-Original and was impressed with the portion to price ratio. The dressing was really good, I need to recreate that recipe at home.  I sat outside on the patio and sipped the wonderful iced tea and enjoyed our gorgeous February weather. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the Chops.

You will want to take a snooze if you fill up on one of these delicious pancake flights and eat yourself into a coma. I came for lunch and ordered breakfast here a few times. They are only open till 2:30 so breakfast/brunch is all they do and they do it really well.  I have had: -The B.E.A.T Sandwich  - Tender Belly Bacon, fried egg, arugula and tomato with bacon-tomato aioli on a ciabatta roll.   -Sandwich I Am - Pretzel Roll!!!! pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, with cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns.  Both of these were delicious. I love the Tempe location and I am glad to have another place to put in to my lunch rotation.

Barrio Urbano is tiny spot/smaller version of Barrio Café located in the large Culinary/Yard complex.   We came in for happy hour the other day and sat at the bar to enjoy a few snacks.  I tried the hibiscus margarita and it was delicious, not too sour with the perfect topping of hibiscus to balance it out. We also split a green chili dip that had slow roasted melt in your mouth pork and a couple of the quesadillas. Everything really good and our bartender was friendly. We will definitely be back to try the 25+ tacos they serve!   Did I mention the ridiculous happy hour? It goes from 7am-6pm ($5 apps, margs and  1/2 off tequila, tacos, apps)..

Fresh, local and organic - what more can you ask for? Great Bloody Mary's of course. This place does farm to table right. I had the breakfast sandwich with a big fat green tomato on top, it was delicious. The coffee is superb as well. Give this place a try.

La Pinata has some of the best tacos in town. These are not the ever so trendy street tacos, these are your big fat loaded crispy tacos. The shredded beef is my favorite.  I've also tried the carne quesadilla and it was packed full of flavor and dripping with cheese.  Parking can be a pain, but it is worth circling the parking lot for the salsa and hot sauce!!

Great drinks and old school video games. The place is always packed and the scene is purposefully hipster. It's pretty rad, last time I went the games were free!

Pita Jungle has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. Yes they have them all over the valley now, but it was the OG location on Apache that started my love affair. Obviously the delicious lavosh schwarma wanted to be closer to my work so he moved to Mill and University so I could enjoy him daily. If I feel like changing it up the portabella burger is always delicious and let us not forget the best damn hummos I've ever tried (any of the multiple varieties).    The new location is beautiful -  it has a huge open dining room spray painted by what looks like your cooler older brother. It has a couple different bars for those in a rush and an area for take out. I didn't get to see the multiple patios (updates to follow) so I will have to come back and eat a falafel in the sunshine.  They happy hour starts at 3pm and includes tons of menu items starting at $3  The new urban hip Mill location just goes to show that some good things never change - food and service were exceptional as always. Lunch on Mill just got sooo much better!

Customize your pizza for no upcharge! You can also order the artisans suggestions (I go the tomato basil - tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, garlic and added pepperoni). The crust is super thin and the cheese was great. Great iced tea options.   This place beats Blaze across the street as you can create your own salad as well. Quick service and friendly staff. Why no plates though? It is more of a waste to split a pizza and have to use another box..

Two of my favorite gut busting foods are pretzel and cheese and the end crusts of pizza. This wonderful brewery/gastro-pub must have had me in mind when creating their menu.   Hurray to Bird City Pale Ale cheese fondue and an even bigger shout out to the cast iron square pizza. Crispy cheesy crust with the ingredients spreading all the way to the ends... Mmmhmmm.   The food here is so good I almost forgot to mention the wonderful local beer selection (thank you PAB). The happy hour is on point and you can get growlers to go. What are you waiting for!
