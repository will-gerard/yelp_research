I didn't stay at the hotel, only went to the buffet.  All I can say is, It's bad when the best part of the buffet is the beverage.

In regards to tires, these guys are the digity. I am on my second set from them, not simply because their prices are right on the money, but because of the service. If you bought your tires there, you get them rotated for free. Got a flat or leak? Fixed for free.  And their quite nice about it.  The waiting room has the typical coffee, TV, magazines, soda machine, and bathroom, but the TV isn't annoyingly loud like some places, the magazines are current, I don't drink soda or coffee so I can't comment on those. The Trader Joes is a 200 foot walk if you want to kill some time.   There is no doubt in my mind why they received the 2011 Business Ethics Award from BBB.

Food is good, I haven't had a bad experience. They have a low calorie healthy burrito which I get a majority of the time. Service is friendly and quit to assist.

We go there two or more times a month and have not had a single bad experience. Not to mention they are the only Thai place I've found west of the 101. My girlfriend only gets the Phad Thai, but I try everything and would recommend going back multiple times because there is a lot to choose from. If your in the area for weekday lunch you can't beat their deal.  The services is always smiling and greeting everyone that walks in the door within a reasonable amount of time.

A little on the pricey side for sandwiches, but the food is fresh and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean.

I really wanted to leave a good review for this place, but that is not what is about to happen. Lesson learned here: Check the Yelp reviews before ordering an sitting in the restaurant.   New Years day, one day a year that you probably, like most Americans, do not want to cook. For dinner my girlfriend suggested Chinese food, a simple request that ended with me still hungry. Since they are one of the closest places to me, I placed an order on-line, this turned out to be mistake #2, with mistake #1 being that I didn't check Yelp before deciding on this place.   The on-line order processing was great since I didn't want to be bothered with a phone call. However, after arriving at Meiwei, they said that the only order they had was scheduled for a pickup time 45 minutes after what I was told. So they apologized and put in my order. Perhaps at this point they should have asked if that was in fact my order they were putting in.  The order was presented to me in normal time. While I was waiting I started looking at the reviews... Rutt Roh! I ordered the sesame chicken as mentioned by someone else, and when any restaurant is labeled as inconsistent, you really have to wonder what you are in for. Mistake #3, not checking the order.  When I got home I thought the order had a few extra items, which I figured they might have been using as a way to make up for the mistake of not putting in my order. Nope! Dead wrong. This wasn't my order!   Now this is where it gets interesting... Would you bring back an order that has more items than you ordered that actually looks good? Mistake #4, I brought it back.  When I did get the correct order I was wishing I kept the previous orders. The Sesame chicken that I was now really ready to eat, because I ordered it over an hour before was, how should we say, not good. Every place I have ever ordered it uses chunks of chicken, this place uses slivers, and as mentioned by argen t., there is hardly any breading and the sauce is real watery. By slivers I mean that it was about the thickness of lettuce, and maybe 1 inch wide by 2 - 4 inches long.  I also ordered 2 appetizers, the spare ribs, which aren't ribs, they are more like spare parts an inch in length, and an order of spring rolls. Out of the 2 spring rolls, I could only down part of one.   I do have to mention that the vegetable fried rice that I got for my girlfriend was pretty good.  As I said in the beginning, I really wanted to write a good review because the employee I was working with went out of her way to make everything right, including throwing in an order of crab-puffs for my trouble.   For the service I would give Meiwei 4 stars, however let's be honest it's the food that makes or breaks a restaurant which pulls this down to a 2 because I don't have the heart to give them a 1.

Just tried this place after seeing it listed on Yelp. Being a Jersey native myself I miss the North East Food, and some of the "NY" named restaurants fall flat on their face when it comes to living up to their name. This place surprised me in a good way. I had the Reuben to see how close they are to the real deal, and it was really good. I was going to take a picture but my phone was not agreeing with me. The menu has a lot of interesting sandwiches that I plan to go back and sample. I asked if they are doing Zepoli's and the owner said 'Not yet' which leave me optimistic. When all is said and done, I will be going back.
