I have had a horrible experience here. Let me start off by saying that it took me 5 years to save up a few thousand dollars that I spent on a Groupon for an invisalign treatment here. I went through about a year of invisalign....After that, one of my bottom teeth was still rotated and I had to go through a refinement and do another year of treatment (I wouldn't have minded much, but I had to wear attachments with my treatment and I didn't think they were very appealing). I had paid a lot of money and spent a lot of time working on getting my teeth straight and I wanted them perfect. At the end of the second treatment I still have a tiny gap near the bottom tooth, but everything else looks pretty straight. I walked out being averagely satisfied. But this isn't the worst part yet....  I had been going to another dentist for my cleanings. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and let them do my semi-annual cleaning. I had asked them if my dental insurance covered my cleaning before I walked back...and was assured that it did. So, I walked back and they cleaned my teeth. I then checked out and asked again if I had owed them anything, to which they responded no. About a month later I get a bill in the mail saying that I owed them $100 for the cleaning. I was extremely upset. It doesn't seem like much, but it is when you are still going to college. I called them to discuss my concern and the front office lady quickly rushed me off the phone and said that I was "out of network" so my insurance didn't cover all of the cost and there was nothing she could do. That would have been nice to know before getting my teeth cleaned, especially when it is covered at 100% at my other dentist. I felt cheated and like I wanted to get this taken care of, so I took off work and went into their office in person to talk to them. I explained how upset I was and the office lady rushed me to a back room to finish discussing. She did end up refunding my $100, but then had the nerve to say that "That's not how I should handle things in the future"...." And that "it's my responsibility to know my insurance coverage"...I agree that it is my responsibility to know my coverage...but I work in healthcare...and it is also the facility's responsibility to give the patient accurate information regarding their service charges. After all of this, I was extremely dissatisfied with their customer service. I did not want to continue going here after going through all of this. However, unfortunately I had not gotten a retainer after my invisalign treatment yet. I had planned on saving up another $450 to do so before going through this nightmare. So instead of spending my money there, I decided to go to another orthodontist to have a retainer made. This is the icing on the cake......  During my consultation with another orthodontist to get a retainer made, he looked at my bite and my teeth and said that he would not make me a retainer because I still needed about another year of invisalign treatment... and that my back teeth were not touching when I bite...which is true. At this point I just wanted to cry. I had spent thousands of dollars and over 2 years trying to make my teeth nice and I got ripped off because it wasn't done thoroughly. I have a few appointments with other orthodontists and am praying that one is willing to make me a retainer. I do not have thousands of dollars laying around to go through another invisalign treatment, and I just want my teeth to at least stay where they are for now...until I can one day save up again and have them done correctly.   Through all of this negativity, I will say that Dr. Ginger Price was nice and worked with me when I needed a filing on my front tooth. She was willing to match the price of my other dentist office at $28....when they initially wanted around $350.... But after everything I went through here I am extremely unhappy and would advise others not to go here.

I had an appointment time for a Friday at 1 and got there at 12:30 and they said there was absolutely no way they could see me early and to return at 1 which I was unable to do so I had to reschedule my appointment for Saturday evening. Understandable given that your appointment time is when they are planning to accommodate their customers.  I show up 5 minutes early to my appointment time and check in. I was then instructed to grab a seat at the Genius Bar when one opens up which I was able to do a couple minutes later. I sat there waiting about 45 minutes after my appointment time to even be spoken to by someone. There would be people next to me getting help and the genius people would finish with them and then bolt behind their big silver door never to return. I would also like to note that someone from their store was leaving so about 30 of the employees gathered in the middle of the store and clapped instead of tending to their customers. Anyways, 45 minutes later one of the genius guys asked if I'd been helped and I told him no... He said that he was sorry and didn't know why he was the only one at the bar at the time. He proceeded to help me.   I was coming in with a watch issue. He pretty much told me to restore my phone and I had to reset my watch again to make it pair. Keep in mind every time I reset it it pairs, so I won't know right away if it is really fixed or not which is annoying. I could have easily done this at home and backed my phone up to my computer, however techs supports help was inadequate.   All in all, I'm getting tired of dealing with apple and their unreliable products. Might be switching my products out in the near future. Get it together, apple. If you make an appointment for a customer, be available for the appointment.

Really good food with fresh ingredients. I had the Hummdinger and I am now going to dream about it in my sleep tonight. The only downfall of this place is that it is always so crowded.. And a little pricey. But I suppose you are paying for quality ingredients. Worth it.

I pay $45 a month for the gophone plan... Which includes 1gb date and unlimited talk and text. Since I am on wireless all the time I don't use much data so this plan is perfect for me. There are other options if you need more.   Also, every time I come in and get help from Amanda N. I am extremely satisfied! She demonstrates excellent customer service and goes the extra mile to help.

Had a random $25 come out of my bank account after I already paid my normal monthly bill. Called to inquire about it and they said they charge me an annual $25 "enhancement" fee.... They explained that since I had gone to pure fitness before and they took over the business,  my membership transferred to them and so I have to pay this annual fee to keep my low monthly rate (of $23 a month)... I find this gym extremely crowded all the time and they only have 3 squat racks. I don't know what they think their "enhancement fee" is going towards but personally I miss pure fitness and this is just another excuse to slide under the radar and try to take an extra $25 a month and hope people don't catch it. I will DEFINITELY be looking into other gyms. This place is bogus.

Worst strip club I've ever been to!! Went with a group of about 10 people for a friends birthday, she hadn't even had a drink yet but the manager "Michael" accused her of being drunk and took her beer out of her hand and poured it into the trash can and kicked her out. It was the rudest most disgusting thing I had ever seen. We all left but he didn't refund any of our money except the girl he kicked out because it was her birthday. Not the smartest thing when you are trying to run a successful strip club. I will NEVER come back here and will be sure to tell all of my friends that this place is a joke and a piece of crap. The club looked clean and the dancers were okay but the management and the staff are TERRIBLE. Plus there were giant bugs (looked like roaches) running all over the ground. No thanks! Don't waste your time or money on this joke of a place.

This dentist office is a joke. They do not put you under anesthesia for oral surgery here and are very unprofessional... I ended up not going through with my surgery because of this. Also, they were not supposed to process a payment and they did... a $250 payment... and it was taken out of my account... I then went to talk to them in person and have it refunded which was supposed to take 24-48 hours... it has been about a week now and I have yet to see the money and have been calling them every single day since. I would HIGHLY advise you to go anywhere else for dental work... especially something serious like oral surgery.

Their iced coffee is the most disgusting coffee I've ever had. I couldn't even drink it. Also, bad customer service. The guy who took my order was very rude. Maybe it was an off day? But I won't be going back.

One of my favorite pizza places in uptown Phx.... The pizza is to die for as well as the pasta and salads... Only thing I would say could improve is their delivery. Every time we order from here they forget something. Other than that it's a great place.

Nice looking store, TERRIBLE customer service. I bought some shoes here and they felt a little weird (plus they only give you one shoe to try on so you can't walk in both to see how they feel)...I was worried they would feel weird later so I asked about the return policy and he said "you can return them in 14 days or exchange in 30 days"...since that was the case I purchased the shoes thinking that if something went wrong I could bring them back. I had the shoes in my possession for 2 days. I wore the shoes around my home while doing laundry for an hour to get a feel for them and decided they weren't for me and wanted to return them. I tried to return them the next day and he said I couldn't return them because they weren't in brand new condition and pointed to the very bottoms of the shoes..... These were roshes with white bottoms....of course they aren't going to be flawlessly white but they weren't so dirty that they couldn't be returned. I have returned shoes to Nike after wearing them to the gym a few times with no problems whatsoever. He was very rude about it and acted like I ran around  in the mud with them. I will be in contact with corporate as he says he is the "manager" (with terrible customer relational skills) and I will never be shopping here again.

Best. Place. Ever! Definitely my favorite place in town for tacos. The atmosphere is really cool, everyone is really nice, they have an amazing happy hour ($5 pitchers and margaritas) that runs often, and the best Mexican street corn I've ever had. Actually, all of their food is the epitome of perfection!

Sooooo delicious! Also, every time we walk in the door we are seated right away. I always get the shrimp ok boy or beef brisket sandwich. You can tell they use fresh, local ingredients. Never disappointed.

The pizza wasn't my favorite. Too tomatoey for my taste. Maybe I'm just not a deep dish person? ...but I also wasn't impressed with the wings or the combination platter. For all the hype it gets I expected a lot more out of this place. Seemed just mediocre to me. Salad looked good though, might try that next time.
