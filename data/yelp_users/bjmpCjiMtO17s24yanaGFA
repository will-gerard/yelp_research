I went to dinner at Deseo with my friend while we were staying at my dads in Scottsdale. I am a huge fan of Latin cuisine so when I saw it was possible to get a three course meal for $39 I jumped at the chance.   I chose the millionaire tacos as the entree which came with avocado and salsa and really enjoyed them. For the main I chose the eye fillet of beef and was pleasantly surprised at the size of beef served - it was great considering it was part of a three course meal. The beef was served with crab meat (not a fan), equadorian potato (delicious!), some peas and snow pea sprouts. Lastly the desert was just super delicious! I had a chocolate cigar and cappucino ice cream.   My friend and I sampled each others food and her entree and desert were really nice. Her main (chicken) was huge but wasn't as nice as her other courses.   The service was prompt and friendly, minus 1 star for the bland mojitos.

The food was sub par, some dishes even inedible. Salt is used in abundance, along with other spices, to the extent that they completely overpowered the dish. In addition, some of the appetizers didn't taste as if they had just been prepared.  The staff is abundant but not very polished or sophisticated (sub 20s), which is what one would expect at the "premiere" restaurant at The Venetian hotel.  I will not return to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone. I've had better overpriced food in Vegas.

Perfect place to end a night/morning of binge-drinking and bro-ing out..   Everything on the menu is good here, but then again everything is when your drunk out of your mind.. I will give Earl Of Sandwich 4 stars regardless since I always find my way over here..  This place can be hard to find, so make sure you ask the PH employees for directions.. I get lost about 3 times out of 5 every time I go there.

I love this place because, unlike it's less desirable, older-fat-sister of a counterpart I don't have to go through 3 elevators, 5 hallways, & 2 bridges (?) just to get to my room.
