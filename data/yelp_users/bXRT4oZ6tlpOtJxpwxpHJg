This location needs to send their mechanics back to school. I spent $500 getting the controller for my A/C fixed here and after that, the air output was terrible. They told me I wouldn't be happy with it and tried to sell me a new fan. I declined. I took it to completely different repair shop and was told that Fletcher's wired the controller in backwards! I bought the family oil change pack but I'm just going to eat the money and move on. I will not let these guys touch another one of my vehicles.

This place is amazing. I'll admit, anytime I go for Italian food, I generally try the ravioli. The bar has been set very high after dining at Olives. The cheese was smooth and creamy, which is a switch from most ricotta. The sauce was amazing and chunky. It tasted as close to fresh tomatoes as you can get. I had a pear martini before dinner and it was excellent.  Although very expensive, I highly recommend eating here if you get the chance.

Nope. Nope. Just, nope.  I wanted to like this place. The menu looked good (even though it is waaaaayyyy too big). Our server was pleasant enough and made wine suggestions. And they put cucumber in the water, which is awesome because I love cucumber in my water. So this is where the two stars came from.  The food, however, is terrible. We started with the Eggplant Cappicola. It came out 22 minutes after we ordered it and I was flummoxed as to what I was supposed to do with these things. They really didn't have any flavor at all and my husband said his portion was cold in the middle. I ate about two bites of mine.   I ordered the Shrimp Giouvetsi on Fillo. When the waiter set this mess in front of me, I was a little appalled. The fillo dough was a soggy mess on the bottom and the edges were ridiculously thick. The shrimp/tomato/artichoke concoction in the center of it tasted weird. Too much rosemary. Like, tree branches of rosemary. It was not OK.  My husband ordered the Chicken Astoria. I tried a couple of the baby corns and the sauce wasn't bad but, like mine, the presentation was awful. Now, don't get me wrong, if food tastes good, you could bring it to me in any presentation and I wouldn't scoff but none of this tasted GOOD. Some of it was OK but none of it was GOOD. Scratch that, the side salad was good. So, there's that.  I won't be come back here. $58 for a terrible appetizer, 2 sub-par entrees, and one glass of wine (I drank water) is not worth the money. And it took 90 minutes to get through this horrid meal. Not OK.

This place is good! I called in an order for carry out and walked over to pick it up. Staff was fast and friendly. I only ordered the yellow curry since it's just me, but it's very tasty. I ordered it 2 spice and it's plenty spicy (glad I didn't talk myself into 3) and it's really flavorful. I'll be going back!

I am spoiled for Indian food now. This place is the best. It smells awesome and the decor is nice. I've eaten here twice, once for lunch when it was slow and it was very quiet and once on Friday when it was busy and it was a little on the loud side. No matter, I love the food. The Lamb Korma is to die for and the Tikka Masala is awesome. The Kashmiri Naan is so good. I love this place.

I really enjoyed our experience at The Keg. The service was good and three out of four of us enjoyed the food.  Unfortunately, my mother did not enjoy her sirloin and said it was tough.  I'd definitely give this place a try but be prepared for your bill as the four of us spent almost $200 on dinner.

Oh, Thai Spices, how do I love thee?  I really enjoy my visits to Thai Spices. The service is always fast and friendly.  I love the yellow curry! I also like the soups they have. Both are delicious. This past weekend I tried a Thai Coffee and it was wonderful.  I recommend a visit to Thai Spices.

I love doing business with Alan's. We purchased our daughter's violin and get all of her supplies from Alan's and have never had an issue. They are always friendly and honest.

Love this place. Food is good, prices are good, and it's close to where I live. We eat here a couple times a month and have never been disappointed. The carry-out is always ready when I get there and I live 5 minutes away.  EDIT: We stopped going here because the service got so bad that we couldn't stand it anymore. We went in on one occasion and were completely ignored by the staff and actually ended up leaving to go somewhere else. On other occasions, service was horribly slow. Such a disappointment because we really loved this place.

Definitely one of the better restaurants in the Phoenix area. The food and service were excellent. I made a reservation for a large group and they gave us our own little alcove to sit in and we had a server all to ourselves. His name was Sean and he did a fantastic job.  The drinks were wonderful. I had a Tin Cup and a Liberator Punch. The Punch was better than the Tin Cup but they were both really good. I enjoy sweeter drinks but my husband had Manhattan and said it was great.  For dinner, I had the steelhead trout. The pickled beet salad with it was very good and the fish was cooked perfectly. I'd love to find out what they seasoned the fish with because it was perfect. My husband had the meatloaf and let me try a bite and it was very tasty. My friend had the scallops and she let me try a bit of the grits and she's lucky I didn't snatch the plate away from her. I'm wondering if they'd just sell me some of those grits.  I also managed to mooch bites of the infamous Original Chopped Salad (which is really pretty before they toss it all together) and the short ribs. Both were excellent.  For dessert, my husband and I split a Pig in the Orchard which is bread pudding with apple and bacon. A most excellent combination. We also took home a bag of the Pecan Bacon Brittle which is as awesome as it sounds.  I definitely plan to go back and have my own plate of grits, um, scallops.

This place is amazing. I went here with a large group (9) and the service was excellent. They were ready to receive us when we arrived and didn't make a fuss over the fact that 3 of my party members no-showed (we were originally 12.)  The cocktails were wonderful and not overly sweet. Definitely creative. My favorite was the Milano Gimlet.   As for the food, I had the Butterfish Crudo, Squid Ink Risotto, Brisket, and an Apricot Crostada for dessert. We also had the Grana and the crispy pig ears for the table.  All of it was excellent and very fresh. I read a few reviews complaining about the portion sizes and, quite frankly, I don't know where you people put your food. I nearly needed to be rolled out of there.  The standout dishes for me were the Squid Ink Risotto, the butterfish, and the crispy pig ears. The pig ears were like big, chewy crispy pieces of the best bacon ever. The risotto was rich and flavorful as the was the butterfish.  I will definitely be back (seriously need to check out the brunch option.)  I almost forgot, someone ordered the Olive Oil Whipped Goat Cheese Grilled Beets for the table and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.

This place is great. Food is great, service is great, owner is great. It's all great. I went there with a large group. I called ahead and they saved us a table. Our server was amazing. We were all rather tipsy by the end of the meal and gladly accommodated our really bizarre check-splitting request.   The food was awesome. The pierogies are sinfully good. The Swedish meatballs are amazing. And there's this wonderful beet salad that I could eat every day. We also had the Beaver Supreme for dessert which is just about the most unique thing I've ever eaten.   We were in there forever and everyone was super nice to us. The owner came out at my friend's request so that we could tell her how awesome our server was. The owner asked us to review her new menu and gave us the recipe for her amazing meatballs!  It was so much fun and I'm sure we will be back!

We rented from Swan's for 18 months and we didn't really have any issues while we were renting. The only issue we really had is that the landscapers screwed something up in the irrigation, which we tried to talk to them about but they didn't fix, and my water bills there were almost $100/mo even though there was no pool.   However, things changed once we told them we intended to move out. We bought a house and we gave plenty of notice that we were moving out. All of a sudden, they wanted to be in the house constantly. The owners wanted to see the property even though they hadn't been there since we moved in 18 months prior. I agreed and took time off of work only to have them no-show. They didn't even CALL me to tell me they weren't coming; I had to call them.  Then came the move-out. We paid an exorbitant early move-out because we ended up moving out a couple of months prior to our lease end which is what was in the contract so, fine. However, on move-out, we cleaned the house from top to bottom, made repairs, and had the carpets professionally cleaned, as per the agreement. The inspector would not work with us on a time to be there when we could be present during the move-out inspection. Big mistake. We should have found a way. When we got our report back on the absolutely last day allowed by law, they said we OWED $25. The report was a joke. There were no details. They said there was animal damage but we didn't have an animal! Just a ton of stuff that was never, ever stated in our yearly inspection reports and were just ridiculous. Their annual inspector told us that we had one of the cleanest inspections that he had ever done two months prior to our move-out. But yet, when we moved out, we OWED $25. They supposedly re-shampooed the carpet, even though we had a receipt. And just a bunch of other nonsense.   I contacted the office both by phone and email and told them I wanted a detailed report, as the law states, on what we actually owed for but I never heard from them again. However, I told them I would not pay the ridiculous $25 they said we owed unless I got this report. Be really careful working with these people. Ronnie is pleasant enough but the move-out from his properties is insane.

This place was awesome. We went with a large group and had a great time. There were 9 of us and, between all of us, we tried raw oysters, gator bites, hush puppies, frog legs, lobster, dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, king crab, and crawfish in varying degrees of seasoning and spice. All of the seafood was super fresh. I had the king crab and it was awesome. Usually the crab meat at the very top of king crab is kind of icky and greenish but this crab was incredibly good. No green skank only tasty, tasty crab! I will definitely go again.

Best. Waffles. Ever. My company had these guys cater breakfast for us and I fell in love. Sought them out again at the Gilbert Farmer's Market with my youngest daughter and was not disappointed. I always have the Nana and it's just about my favorite breakfast ever. Super filling. First one I had took me over an hour to eat. If you see this big, pink truck, grab a waffle. You'll thank me later.

Hands down, this is the best BBQ I have ever had. Always go really early or wait until after 12:30 (although you risk there being less selection.) The brisket is amazing and I could eat my weight in jalapeno cheese grits (that's a lot of grits.) I kind of want to tell everyone this place sucks just so there's more for me.

My husband and I tried this place tonight and we've decided to make this place our weekly date night restaurant. It's super close to our house and has great food an a lovely atmosphere. They have a good selection of wines and a decent selection of beers.  The food was very good. We started with a monthly special, the loaded fries, which were really good. They hand cut their fries and these were smothered with cheese, thick bacon, and jalapenos. NOM.  We also split a Meat and Cheese board. Excellent selection of meats and cheese and the spicy nuts add-on was fantastic. We also tried the beignets, which were wonderful.  This place would make an excellent place to take a date. Can't wait to try the live music next week.

I appreciate an affordable fondue option. The owners are very nice. Restaurant was clean and quiet (which is wonderful considering how many places you go that are so loud you can't hear yourself think). The fondue was good. I liked the swiss the best, my mom liked the cheddar best. We also tried the milk chocolate which was very tasty. I plan to go back again and take my daughter. Very kid-friendly atmosphere and I'm betting I can get her to eat all kinds of veggies if there's cheese to dip them in!
