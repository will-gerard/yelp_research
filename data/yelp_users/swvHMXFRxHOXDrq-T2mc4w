The first time we came here we had a great experience. The last 3 times, very disappointing.  Take out order was wrong and 2 times, service painfully slow. We sat Dow and I told server 'we're starving. I'll start with the salad rolls please.' 15 minutes later, asked where they were, and she said 'oh I thought you wanted it all together.' A table that came in about 10 minutes after us was served before us.  So by the time I go to eat my appetizer, my warm food was cold.

A very special friend sent me flowers through Brady's and the arrangement I received was lovely, until the next day, when the flowers were already wilted.  By day 2 the arrangement looked a week old.  They kindly offered to replace the flowers, but the second arrangement was not nearly as nice as the first. By day 3, about a 1/4 of the flowers were all brown and dried  up again, even though we have kept the water filled up and fresh.  I would not recommend them.

Great concept! Look forward to more and more organic choices. Also, please consider getting rid of the styrofoam cups and going with a more 'green' option.
