crossing my fingers that I'm reviewing the right location.. They sent a technician to my house so I'm not sure where they came from. Brian came over to fix a crack in my windshield and he was great. I missed two calls from him when he got here and he was so patient and kind for dealing with waiting outside my house for me. His work was fast & diligent and I'm very happy I decided to go with satellite!

I cannot believe that there are so many negative reviews here. It seems ludicrous compared to my experience with the healthcare clinic.  I made an appointment online for 2PM, and the NP saw me on time so I didn't have to wait around forever. I don't think I was there longer than 20 minutes. The NP (his name was Guy!) was quick and attentive. He was very kind and personable, and he got me the right prescription and sent me on my way.  The pharmacy staff as well as the store staff were also very pleasant. The store was clean and well stocked and I had no issues whatsoever.  One of the NPs even called me a few days later to make sure everything was good. I've been to Walgreen healthcare centers plenty of times for various reasons and that had never happened before.  This store was the only one with appointments open, which is why I picked it even though it is on the other side of town from where I work and live. From now on this will be my primary Walgreens healthcare center!

Fantastic service. They offered to remake a pizza for me that I ordered wrong & they absolutely did not have to do that for me. 10/10 very impressed. Will be back.

I love cartel so much, but I never go to the ones outside of the airport because the employees are pretentious and I don't believe that's good customer service. However, for whatever reason, the managers at the airport cartel did a much better job at hiring and this place is a must whenever I visit the airport. The coffee is high quality and these employees are not rude. They are welcoming and kind and I believe they deserve all the best in business.

Look, local business is a really important thing to advocate for. Especially in this area of the state where there seems to be a growing pride of our land, AZ wilderness is the perfect brewery idea. However, I was really disappointed in my experience there.  I ordered the stout but was given an IPA by the blonde bartender who was very short with us. She warned us that it was last call but then ignored us when it was time to order - she was off in the corner chatting with her friends who came to visit. She was snappy when I asked for a water and didn't show any hospitality.  When we finally got a table, the waitress came to greet us, and then disappeared for 25 minutes. We had to ask the hostess if she was coming back. We contemplated leaving, and maybe we just should have, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  The duck fries were really good, and so was the artichoke dip. The Cannoli nachos were overly lemony. The food was over all good. Some of the burgers on the menu looked amazing. But we didn't have time to try them due to the 25 minutes we waited at our table under the over active misters.  Over all, the food and beer were alright. The service was absolutely terrible. This kind of place would be so much better if they hired attentive and nice people. Probably won't return for awhile.
