Terrible customer service, not at all worth the price of tickets, even at half off.  Don't waste your time.  Total rip-off.

Super friendly guys, and they'll give it to you straight, which can be hard to find in the auto repair industry.  Highly recommended!

If you're looking for a fantastic place to have the time of your life, meet some amazing people, and get a great workout all at the same time, then Arizona Trapeze School is the place to be!  Check something crazy off your bucket list, learn to fly through the air with the greatest of ease, and brag to all your friends afterwards about how you stared fear in the face and emerged victorious!  Try it, you'll love it!!

So there is a crazy neighbor next door who has nothing better to do than yell at people who are having fun, and write fake yelp reviews.  Fortunately, nobody pays attention to her and knows that she is a disturbed individual who can not enjoy the happiness of others.  Arizona Trapeze School is a wonderful place, and will be sadly missed by many.  Shame on her for being such a sad, sad person.

Absolutely the best hookah in Phoenix!  Love this place!!  Not surprising it has such a high rating: the staff, service, and selection are fantastic.  Make sure to try the "gummy bear" hookah- it's lip-smackingly delicious!!  They serve great snack food too, til pretty late in the evening.  Highly, highly recommend this place :)
