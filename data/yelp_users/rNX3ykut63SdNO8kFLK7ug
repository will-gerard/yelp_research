Who charges over $8 for a margarita and only puts in 1.25 ounces of tequila???? CHILI'S!!!!!!!!!  I ask the bartender because the last time we came I did their table survey and mentioned how weak their drinks were. So tonight before I ordered tonight I ask.  Guess I will be drinking water tonight!

I must say I can only eat at the one in Goodyear! The others I've visited don't compare. It's always consistent the food taste great and the service excellent.  Amber the server is hands down one of the best if not the best server in Goodyear. If you read my Yelps you'll see I'm quite picky and brutally honest, probably because I use to be in the restaurant business and I have eaten out every night for the last 10 years. The Fire Grill Chicken with melted jack and bacon strips with honey mustard (a dish they allowed me to create) that's real customer satisfaction. They get it!!! Oh and the FRESH brown bread!!! Yummmm!! From Management to staff, kudos!  Alice, Tom (asst. manager) and Amber job well done!!

Very pleased with the experience I received at the Goodyear Enterprise location. I had to return the rental car but was two days late! Yikes. However, the staff was very pleasant and understanding. Gilbert happened to be the person who checked me in and out, he was very professional and efficient. I did have an issue with the smell in the car when we picked it up. Which seemed to get worse instead of better as the day progressed. It smelled like someone tried to cover the odor with perfume. No Bueno!!! When I brought this to his attention the I didn't realize the assistant manager Carrie was listening and immediately stepped in. She was very apologetic and she actually took off 1 day rental. I was shocked and very grateful!!! To me that indicates a well trained staff with exceptional attention to providing customer satisfaction. I would have given a  5 Star if not for the smell, but definitely a 5 Star for the service!

Only concern was the soda glass my daughter got was broken around the rim, quite dangerous! Our server immediately apologize and brought her a fresh soda. Love the "skinny menu" the skinny margarita was very good and under 150 calories!!! Edamame needed some salt they were rather bland. My two 14yr old girls had glam burgers and they were HUGE they could have split one. Very juicy very tasty! Now time for the snickers and dream extreme cheesecake!! I will just be drinking water!! Gotta get in shape!!! Angelica our server was very pleasant and on the ball. I listened to her talk to her tables around us and she was genuinely kind and made sure everyone was enjoying their meals. Sweet girl.

Horrible!!!!! I was at this location about  3 months ago and I was reminded why it had been so long! The service is terrible there's no sense of urgency or customer service. Our food came out 47 minutes after we ordered although the server was very apologetic the manager NEVER came to the table to apologize. The "taste" of the food was good but it was cold my chicken breast was dry and probably the smallest chicken breast I've ever seen. I mentioned it to the food runner he rolled his eyes and walked away! WOW!!! My husbands order was wrong he ate it anyway and when he ask for a water refill it literally took 10 minutes after the server took his glass, When we reminded him we needed the water still he said he had to request water refills with kitchen! Huh? Very disappointed, just not worth it! Guaranteed if they had a competitor close by Lo Lo's would cease to exist. Longest Lunch known to man thank God it was my day off.

Wow!!!! It's been a while since I've been able to give Kona Grill a 5 star review! I must say the macadamia nut chicken was cooked perfectly and the brownie for dessert, nice and moist!  My biggest compliment goes to Nick Laban (spelling ?) It's not often you get a server who you can tell enjoys what they do and wants to make sure the customer enjoys their dining experience. Nick was very attentive and even joked a little bit to make our experience fun. I had my 14yr old, so fun is always important! Ha! I've been coming to Kona for YEARS and never had a server do the warm hand towelettes after our meal. VERY COOL!! See video!

Love, love, love!!!! Took daughter there 4 years ago for the chocolate tour. She had fun. Hadn't had been back only because of location and my crazy schedule so I was so happy when a client of mine brought me a box of my favorites! Their chocolate mints, they just melt in your mouth!!! Yummy!!!

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Very disappointed in the way things were handled when the server knocked a full glass of water on the table and on my 13 yr olds daughters lap. They covered it with a napkin and laughed it off. As we sat with our feet in water during the rest of the meal.  When the check came the host said "I'm really sorry I ask to take hers off the check and was told no." You could tell she was embarrassed to even say it. Manager never came over to apologize.  As for the food it was okay they give you little slivers each time they come to your table and they didn't even bring out everything they supposedly offer. We had to ask for sauce from 3 different people before we got it. It seemed like it was an inconvenience for them that we were there. We will not go back and it is not worth the $29.00 per person.

Love the BLT Plus with a cup of the potato soup!! I can always count on having a satisfying meal. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. Just have to take late lunches or else your going to have trouble finding a place to sit.

Really we ask twice for fresh fries and when they did come out it was obviously from the bottom of the basket. When I ask for the 10 raggedy fries to be replace she gave me a look and said it will be 5 minutes in a snotty way. I hate this place! I got the Banzai burger and didn't realize it would be drenched in teriyaki sauce that would make the bun so soggy it was gross.

Poor girl at Starbucks was left by herself and the line was insane! She ask for help over intercom several times even ask a passing coworker to pleas get "Nicole" who obviously was uninterested in helping her. The sad thing is she was in the mirrored room right next to the Starbucks area. The poor girl said I know she can see this. I give the young lady kudos she pressed through and 15 min later I got my coffee and she was still smiling taking orders and making coffee by herself! Oh the pumpkin spice latte was delicious never had it before!

We had the avocado Chicken sandwich and the French dip along with the creamy potato soup a the honey drizzled croissants! Oh how can I forget the spinach dip and chips! I know a lot for being almost 9pm but when we're in this part of town we have to order all of our favorites at once and we weren't disappointed! Great Food and Great Service! Thanks to Austin our server for the nicely warm wet napkin w/ the lemon on top for my daughter to clean off her hands from the sticky croissants. It was a nice touch, very impressive! Job well done! Oh and thanks for letting me take your picture to post!!!

My first time at this spot and it was very good! I loved the laid back atmosphere and the cocktails! Had appetizers yucca chips? I think that's how you spell it, they were very tasty and the pizza was pretty good also. The owner introduced himself and ask how everything was, you can tell he wanted to make sure everyone who comes into his establishment has a good experience. I will be back!

My daughter decided 2 months ago she wanted to go to Petco to get hermit crab supplies. We walked in and I couldn't stand the strong pet odor. I walked around with my head in my shirt, of course embarrassing my 14 yr old. It was really bad! People say I have a sensitive nose but I know stank! When we were checking out I told Miles a staff member that he needed to hurry and cash us out because I couldn't take it. He apologized and said they clean regularly. Fast Forward  2 months we had to go back for more supplies and it was actually pleasant! Miles remembered me and said how does it smell? I was surprised he remembered and even cared to ask. He said he took to heart what I said and told his manager about my complaint. The manager actually changed how they do some things that deal with odor to make people like me and others have a more pleasurable experience and not want to hurry and run out. WOW MILES impressive!!! SEE YOU SOON!

Horrible! The Thai Dynamite with Chicken was way to sour, tasted like the kitchen went overboard with lime juice. The rice was mushy had a funky texture. My daughter got the Chicken Fried Rice and she said it was flavorless and the chicken was chewy. We used to eat here all the time 3 years ago, boy have things changed. Not a good experience. We should have known when we sat down and a lady next to us got up and left leaving 3/4 of the food on her plate. We thought she was getting a soda refill until she walked out after getting more soda. Yikes!! The bathroom cleanliness was terrible it looked like a tornado had just gone through it. There's only 8 tables seated so I'm wondering why it hasn't been checked since noon lunch rush (I'm guessing). We won't be back. Off to McDonalds!!!

I've been coming to Phoenix Nail & Spa for 4 years and I'm kicking myself for not ever giving them a review. As you can see by my Yelp reviews I believe that if you pay for a service you should expect quality. I had been to several nail salons in Goodyear and Avondale and wasn't impressed at all. I was told about Phoenix Nail Spa and I've never gone anywhere else since! The staff if very polite and professional, they make sure that your comfortable and they are highly skilled at their profession. Ha the owner is very accommodating and always has a smile when you walk in. Ha was the owner of a salon in Scottsdale before moving his family to Goodyear so he knows how to take care of "high maintenance" customers, like me! Definitely check it out! Great Service & a Great Prices!

I go EVERYDAY AND order the same thing EVERYDAY FOR 5 years!!! What part of LIGHT DRIZZLE CARMEL DRIZZLE CAN'T YOU READ!! Ugggggggg!!! I'm so frustrated with Starbucks in general. Last week my phone app wasn't and still isn't working so I can only pay with cash, thus missing my rewards for their expense coffee. The 800 rep tells me well if you don't have all receipts for several days it's to bad!! Wow! Great customer service! Dutch Bros here I come.

I must say I was very impressed by how the staff treated me. I came in 5 minutes before they were getting ready to close. I thought they closed at 10pm not 9pm. I ask if it was okay to still fine in and if not I wouldn't be offended and I totally understood. They we're so kind and said absolutely you can order and they didn't serve me attitude or give me the "look". A young lady named Mary Anne was extremely pleasant and made me feel comfortable and assured me I didn't need to rush but could sit and enjoy my pizza! She checked on me to make sure I was doing well and even gave me a to go cup for soda when I was ready to leave. Of course I ate faster than normal because I felt so bad but they were all so nice... I really appreciated their kindness after a long day... Good service is hard to find in Goodyear but I know where you won't be disappointed NY PD in Avondale! Very professional! Oh the pizza was perfect!!   Glenda

High Class Operation from start to finish.  Chip is very prompt and the entire crew takes pride not only in the actual electrical work but in being friendly and personable to customers.  You can tell that it is a top priority for the company.

I had a great vodka strawberry lemonade! I was going to have lunch but my friend wasn't "feeling" the atmosphere. I think it was quite nice, I like dark elegant settings. I'm anxious to go back next week to try the chicken sandwich they are featuring for some chef contest!!! More to come...

Mediocre...quite disappointing. We typically do get take out for dinner but it's a Friday night and I don't like the long waits for a table. I may reconsider and wait next time. Obviously by the lasagna photos it wasn't looking like a good start. One was actual lasagna the other was the remainder of the bottom of the pan. My husband said it was like mush. He let me have the "good" one. My daughter had the wood grilled chicken she said it was good. The dessert was chocolate dream but was a nightmare... It was hard and tasted stale. Which is odd because I thought they made them daily? We eat at Carrabbas four times a month at least and this was probably the most disappointing... I hope that this was not the norm for getting take out because it leaves a bad impression about the restaurant which I know is better than what I experienced tonight.

A COCK ROACH!! Okay this would have been a 4 star rating  BUT once I finished having a great "real beef" bacon burger with fries that were slightly soggy, (which my daughter says they are always that way) I like my fries a little more crisp. I was pretty pleased with the food and the service the staff was very nice the food was flavorful and hot. Then I happen to look down and there a huge cock roach crawling on the floor! I thought I was going to give them back their meal! Ugggg!!! I told a worker and he was pleasant and ask manager what to do then went and pick it up and took outside and killed it. I HOPE this was a unusual incident and they don't have a big bug issue. I will not be going back for a while if at all, I'm afraid my mind would get the best of me while trying to enjoy a burger.

I wanted to give a big thank you to the young gentleman "London" I hope I spelled it right. That works at the Starbucks in the Target. I didn't order my coffee correctly because I deviated from my normal drink and when I ask him to remake it. He obliged and didn't give me the "look".  He actually talked me through the normal recipe making sure it was done exactly how I wanted it. He then went above and beyond when I ask about where to get a Caesar salad to go. He walked with me to the location and then checked me out. Very pleasant and very accommodating! I like mornings like that.

Would the owner/operator please step in and take care of your business! You may want VALERIA to go through training again. This young lady made our food and was quite rude I felt like I was in a soup line and like I was being an inconvenience to her for being there. She threw the ingredients in the tin like she didn't want to be there when I ask her a question she literally just stared at me answered and rolled her eyes! WOW!!!!! It seemed like she didn't want to be there and honestly she shouldn't have been. The cashier Alejandrin was pleasant and when I ask for a survey card she actually took initiative and went and found a prior receipt with the information for me. The restaurant had 2 other tables dining other than my family and 4 employees including a manager and the dining room was a mess. Mr. or Ms. Owner we know that no one can run your business like you do but anyone can run it into the ground. Word of mouth travels fast... I've eaten at the Cafe Rio location in Scottsdale several times and even the food at the Avondale location wasn't as tasty. Then again it could have been the girl making it, over kill on the red/enchilada/ sauce ruined the burrito. My daughter got the quesadilla took one bite and threw the rest in the garbage. My husband said Chipotle would have been a better choice. I honest believe it was the location. We won't be back...

It was my first time at Glo Med Spa and I called to see if I could just walk in. My daughter was at an appointment and I needed to waste time. The young lady who answered the phone was so pleasant and accommodating she said i could come right in. Dr. Charles was very funny and made me feel comfortable. I went in for Dysport injections and a "Skinny" shot better known as fat burner or MIC. Since it takes a few days to see the results I will write a follow up. So far my experience has been top notch!

I wanted to follow up with my results! It's been a week and I was getting a little nervous because I've always used Botox and this was the first time I've deviated and used the product Dysport. Day 4 was when it actually kicked in to where I could see a noticeable difference. Each day continues to get better. I'm very pleased with the results and will definitely be back to see Dr. Charles. Next time I will probably get a little more aggressive between my eyebrows, maybe Dr. Charles will let me come in for a "touch up" in that area!  Two Thumbs Up!!!

Food was great, portions were larger than I expected!! Overall very pleased and would definitely go back! My only complaints was the looooong wait to get our food and the service wasn't the best. It wasn't busy when we arrived at 7:55pm but the waitress seemed very frazzled. It took her a long time just to do simple task.

Went last night, not very impressed. The pics online and in menu are deceiving. Yes marketing pictures are typically that way but this was an exception. The Jack burger was flavorless and the fries cold. My friends daughter had the ribs which were tough and the sauce bland. Unfortunately for us it was live band night and it was so loud we couldn't visit. We ask to go outside just so we could hear each other. Service was mediocre. I over heard someone at another outdoor table say  "this place isn't going to last long"  yikes!!!!! I wish them the best!

MOD Pizza!!!! So I'm back and its been a much better experience! Of course the staff was great just like last time and they seem to have fun working together which makes it a nice place to come have dinner. Levi and Tino were great!!! Pizza was excellent and the milk shakes AMAZING!!!! I think that the kinks have have been worked out and MOD Pizza will be pretty successful here in Goodyear. When you have a company that has an owner/operator that cares about what their patrons say, you're bound to be successful! Thanks for listening!

This was my second visit and I must say I was pleased overall. The staff is very nice and the atmosphere is full of energy, although it can be a bit loud and hard to have a conversation without having to raise your voice. The food was delicious! I got the beef burger with the shredded pork on top!! I love meat so it was perfect and the fries were nice and hot. My major complaint is that I'm a big chocolate dessert lover and so was my lunch date. Unfortunately there's NO chocolate cake, pie, torte or brownie on the menu, only variations of caramelized bananas with the exception of these deep fried mini puffs that come with a side of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce that the manager suggested. It was okay but didn't hit the mark of what we were wanting.
