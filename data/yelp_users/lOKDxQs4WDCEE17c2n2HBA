Oh Lord, they changed the menu. We had the calamari which was excellent, loved the sauce and presentation. The stuffed shrimp was a huge miss, skip them. The ribeye was as wonderful as ever with fried onion petals on top. Fish was really good but those hush puppies are the star. Always a great meal.

Back after 12 years to the place I met Paul. Outside bar and stage is much better than I remember. All you sissies complaining, lighten up, it's been here longer than the TGIF's you're used to. I love this place.

Food poison. My husband was sick after eating the wings. They were under cooked. Pizza Hut admitted this and sent a $60 gift card to our home. Do not order wings from here.

We used a groupon to try this place out. I am very pleased and will shop there again. It's hard finding a good butcher shop, we've been to many. I'm glad we now know about Hobe. We had the NY strip tonight and it was just perfect with just salt and pepper.

My favorite place for enchiladas  I order the same thing every time I'm here, standing joke that I even look at the menu. Enchiladas! Paul loves the creme of poblano soup, winter only.

We have eaten here twice in the last week. It is a great place for when you really don't know what you're hungry for. The menu has a wide varity, chicken Parm to pot roast. They also have breakfast all day. The sweet cream pancakes were so good. There is a hint of a spice, not vanilla but close, that I just loved. The thick cut bacon was great. So many places have junk bacon but here it's super tasty. My husband had the corn beef and hash, he really loved it, cleaned his plate. The pot roast tasted just like i hoped it would. Mashed potatoes were spot on. I saw several other tables that had great looking sandwiches, I'll try one next time.

I ordered the mac and cheese to go the other night. This place has the to go routine down perfectly. When I got home there was 2 pieces of bread that was really great with a small container of oil and vinegar. This was a nice surprise. I had a small Cesar salad which had the dressing packet separate so it wasn't soggy at all. There was also a container with pepper flakes and another with Parmesan. I thought everything was really good although the sausage was more spicy then I would prefer in a mac and cheese. I will use the to go service more often now.

The cucumbers with sesame seeds were really good. I had the new winter menu firecracker chicken which I really enjoyed. I asked for a spicy noodle as a side instead of rice. I really liked what they brought out, just spicy enough. My friend also ordered from the new menu. She had the red wine beef and she asked it to not be spicy, which they did perfectly. Chocolate cake to wrap it up which was tasty. Doggy bags for sure! The staff are always so nice and helpful.

Props to our server Kyle and the female manager working today around 1230. My friend is allergic to shrimp and she told Kyle this. He said he would inform the kitchen. Cross contamination is obviously a concern of hers. We ordered 4 appetizers and 1 main dish, we planned on extras to take home to the hubbies. Our food was served by a runner. Almost as soon as our food was placed on the table the manager and Kyle were standing by us. The manager had a list in her hand which clearly stated allergies precautions. 3 of the 5 dishes contained oyster sauce or another sensitive ingredient. I offered to put the dishes on my side of the tab and just move on. They both offered other similar options that were safe for my friend. We couldn't be more surprised when we received the bill, 2 dishes were comped. That wasn't necessary but it sure was nice. I really appreciate great service but more importantly I find the urgency in taking food allergies seriously. There was a slip in the system but the staff were right on it. Good job, pat on the back for you.

We had the Mac and cheese, really awesome, bacon. Corn fritters with a bacon aeoli, also really great, jalapeño gives it the slightest spark, corn adds sweetness. Pub burger w/ bacon and cheese, can't go wrong there. Parmesan crusted chicken, my favorite. It's always cooked perfectly. Staff were great, bringing extra plates since we were sharing everything. Always friendly and attentive.

Not good. Clearly a copy cat of Panda Express. Many empty pans so I wasn't sure what I could order.  Once our orders were half fixed a call for a take out order was called in. The owner took the call while our food sat there. What happened to taking care of the money in front of your face? The copy of orange chicken is bad. The "chop chop chicken" is a chicken breast that had been sitting under a cover for too long. The crab Rangoon are a joke, only cream cheese at best. Spider webs under chairs should of been our clue. We are really in a loosing stretch lately.  We will stick to Panda Express when we are seeking Chinese fast food.

We had a great time. I love proper service and I can't say enough about how pleased I am. Every server was happy, polite and very friendly. The salad bar was great. There was a bowl of very dry bacon, how can you not be happy with this. All the salads I tried were top notch. Sliced cheese and meats were great. Don't go crazy there, the meats being served table side are delicious. The sirloins and ribeye were my favorites. Grilled bananas were one of the sides and I loved those. Desert was a chocolate mouse cake, devine. I will be there again!

I had a very pleasant experience here yesterday. I had a large order that I placed and I explained to the employee that we would be traveling with the food for an hour before we would be eating it. The staff did a great job packing everything up almost catering style. We had plenty of sauces and limes. Nothing was soggy because everything was packed separately. We really appreciated their efforts. Our dessert was forgotten which we stopped in for on the way home. My son said as soon as the staff member saw him she said "I know what you're here for " and apologized very sincerely and threw in an extra cake for us. I don't expect perfection. I expect 100% effort and when a mistake is made, own it, and make it better. I'm very happy with the food and the service I received.

Wonderful experience. Did our reservations online and wrote this was my parents 50th wedding anniversary dinner. Our menus across the top stated this, such a thoughtful and sweet gesture. The head chef signed one and it was given back to my Mom with a beautiful bow. This will end up in her scrap book without a doubt. To write about the 3 appetizers, 5 meals and 3 desserts would take too long. I will mention the best. NY strip, scallops and chocolate soufflé. Everything from the duck to the buffalo was fabulous but those 3 were my favorites. All the staff were superb, our waiter was on spot. I love great waitstaff so I really appreciated them all. We sat at 530 so we enjoyed a great sunset. The location is beautiful and the overall feel is comfortable. The whole experience was great start to finish. The only odd thing was the music. DUB, techno and something similar my son called Trap was not really fitting for the atmosphere.

Not wowed. We started with bruschetta board. BLT- lettuce, tomato and a few pieces of bacon, clunky to eat, nothing special. Chicken salad- I think I have bought this at Costco. Hubby liked both hummus. We had full orders of the fish, shrimp and pork tacos. There was one deep fried shrimp  for each taco, skimpy. Not enough meat on the pork tacos. I really liked the fish tacos. We also ordered a beef tamale. Disappointing, not enough meat or spice. The Santa Marta dessert was very good. The flower tea was great. I wish we would of been there after 3, the happy hour menu you looked way better then the lunch menu we had to order from. The stuff we saw delivered to other tables looked awesome.

We had a great evening out on the patio. We started with the pretzel and cheese fondue. Very good, I wish I could bake such a fine bread, it was really light and tasty. I had the scallops, a bit sandy but that's par for the course, only 4 of them. Pricey, $23, I would of thought 6 for that price. Hubby had the beef short rib stew, he liked it. Guest had fish and chips and she cleaned her plate. Other guest had the chicken stroganoff which looked great. Homemade noodles, he said it needed a bit more sauce. We all split the salted caramel pudding, super sweet but really good. A table over had 3 orders of the ribs and they smelled terrific, I'll order them next time. We were there at 745, we didn't order our entrees until about 845 and by then the prime rib was sold out. That was my first choice, also saw that at other tables and it looked great. Too much time chit chatting! Our waiter was great, he knew we were going to be there for a long time and never rushed us. We hadn't seen these friends in years so it was a great time. 6 beers and 2 ice teas plus entrees and appetizer was $145 plus tip so $175. Not what I want to pay for everyday meals but I'm ok with it. The patio is very comfortable, not too crowded, service was what I wanted, food was good, people watching was fun, I felt very comfortable. Next time we will try indoors and I'll order meat, earlier!

Worst chicken Parmesan I've ever had. I asked for sauce on the side. Dish came out w penne pasta and a very strange looking piece of breaded, clearly pre-made, pre-frozen piece of chicken. I stated "I've never seen a chicken Parmesan without melted cheese on it".  Cook said to me "do you want some parmesan?" I said no, I wanted some mozzarella melted on it. I watched the main female cook throw some cheese on my dish, put it in a microwave and re-serve it to me. To say the chicken why dry and hard would be an understatement. I've eaten here before and I will tell you, stick to the sandwiches or salads. My husband had the lasagna, also a microwaved hot mess, although very flavorful. I don't know why a broil devise is not being used? When the male cook brought my dish back to me I should of just refused it. I would of been embarrassed to give this to a customer.

Pork Adovada, Yucatan Shrimp and Peking Duck taco. Street corn w/ habanero butter, chipotle mayonnaise and Cotija cheese. My mouth is on fire and I love it. Combination of flavors and spice are really interesting. Need to serve corn w/ some lime. Coconut cream pie, very dense even more so then a cheesecake. A bit odd but tasted spot on, fresh whip cream makes me happy. This place is an old church, great atmosphere!! Guitarist sounds good. Pleasant variety of guests.

Skip this place. I try not to be negative but this place was awful. Very bad and scary location. Pizza was gross, almost no cheese and toppings were spongy and just weird. The fried chicken was edible at best, greasy and I feared it wasn't cooked through. The jambalaya was so dry and tasted awful. We waited 45 minutes. Living Social and Groupon need to rethink who they do business with. It was so shady there we took our food to a Costco parking lot and tailgated. I can overlook a lot if the food is good but this was not good food. Waste of time and money.

We had 2 scoops of egg salad w/ crackers as our appetizer. It was great and the texture was spot on. Next time I'll ask for more lettuce to make mini wraps. This is not on the menu so you have to ask. We had a rueben and a Dinty Moore w/ horseradish. Both were huge!!! The meat is super tender and very flavorful. We will be back to try something from the all day breakfast menu. Staff are super nice and very accommodating.  Good job.

I like that you can order any sandwich with a bagel thin. If you haven't tried one of their sandwiches you should. For the coffee drinkers, it seems popular. Breakfast sandwiches all day!!

Great surprise! Crinkle french fries are really great. Coleslaw is very tasty. Chicken tasted very fresh, nice and crispy. Secret sauce is ranch and BBQ sauce I suspect. Tastes great with the chicken. Employees are very friendly and efficient. Will return.

We ordered a side of Mac n cheese for an appetizer. We both ordered fish since it was Friday, with side salads. We also asked for a cup of the soup of the day- clam chowder. The salads came out first, then 2 minutes later the soup arrived. 1 minute later the Mac and cheese arrived. We joked that the word "appetizer" seems to be beyond most servers. We had a few bites of our salad and our entrees arrived. Are you kidding me? We had so many plates on our table the waiter made a joke about it. I just looked at him like "are you punking me". To top this off 3 different servers seemed to be our servers plus the food runners. We had to ask several for refills of water. We also had to grab someone for salt/pepper and to just get our bill. They were all super friendly but it's super clear there is no leadership or management guiding them. The deco is great, the food was all good. We will try one more time, I always give local places a second try. These service issues must be addressed. Any pos system should allow a server to time when food comes out. Clearly there is a miscommunication between the servers and cooks, this is a management issue.

Moist brisket is my favorite followed by ribs. Sweet corn I love. A sweet tea is always a treat. I've had everything on the menu except the prime rib and everything is always great. From Texas to Colorado, the BBQ is always great.

We had the admirals feast which is not on the menu but is a very large combo plater. Haddock, clams, scallops, fries, onion rings (all fried) 2 sauces and slaw. Cost was roughly $50 with 2 drinks. We had plenty of leftovers for our son and lunch the next day minus the scallops, there were only 10 and none made it home. This is a very odd strip mall, had I not seen this place on yelp I would of never noticed this place. Signage is horrible. Such a shame because the food is great. I will go back for sure. I love good scallops and will go back just for them. They also serve NY hotdogs which I will also try. -- Owner is super invested and offers great service. I hope they stick around because the food is really good. I recommend you try it out.

Not good and very weird. #1 I want to say, the waiters and waitresses tried to do a great job but they are disabled by a bad system. We ordered corn fritters, sausage, shrimp, crab, fries, corn, calimari, potatoes. The food came out 1 at a time and in a very odd order. My shrimp came out 20 minutes before my husbands crab. Very uncomfortable for a meal. What we thought was going to be an appetizer came mid meal. There is no designated waiter/waitress which made the experience odd and unsuccessful. We were asked 6 times if we were ready to order after we had already put in our order. Again, the staff were so nice but clearly the training and the overall plan are a mess. Our fries were brought to our table completely frozen. They never hit a fryer at all. We are still trying to figure out how this happened. Frozen, straight from the bag but served to us. This was my husbands birthday dinner, we just laughed. My potatoes were stone cold along with the corn. My shrimp was not deveined which is gross and unsanitary. My husband ordered the crab and only got 3 legs which seems odd. We also had to pay $1 for butter, who serves crab without butter? We had to ask for cocktail sauce for the shrimp, a pail for trash and an extra fork. Someone else mentioned chickens with their heads cut off, that explains the staff exactly. Although working hard, they are misguided. Clearly this restaurant is trying to break the mold, unfortunately they are missing the mark. We left to have deserts at another restaurant. Although our wait staffers tried very hard, we will not return nor recommend this place. Come on, frozen fries? No manager coming to our table to apologize. They all acted that this was not the first time this has happened. Sad sad sad, we had high hopes.
