Excellent Customer Service!  The office is very homie and friendly.  They treat you like a friend.  I like the technology and education they provide and the way they contact me about my appointments.  Every time I go there, me and my family have a wonderful experience.  I recommend to my friends all the time!!!

I go and get my pedicures at this place.  I love Ann she does a great foot massage.  I brought my daughter to get a fill.  She saw Tri and he did a fair job.  She fell and broke a nail and came in to get a repair and polish change.  She saw a women (not sure of he name) and she did a terrible job. The nail she put on looked completely different then the other nails and the polish was wavy and poorly done.  We went back 30 minutes late and Tri removed polish and it looked better but did not fix the nail she said was not correct.  They charged me $20.00.  That evening the nail fell off. Very disappointed in the service and charge since the nail came off that evening.  I would go for pedicures with Ann but stay away from other services.
