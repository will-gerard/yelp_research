Omgosh. It has been a while since I came to this location. It has been remodeled and the ambience when you walk in the door is amazing. The waiting area is like a lounge space in a club or bar. The upgraded bar is almost swanky.  As far as the food, I always rely on old faithful. Medium wings and a 1/2 order of Aussie fries. You can't go wrong. They did have a special for a 3 course steak meal for 11.99.  I just took a sip of my Wallaby Darned drink, frozen daiquiri peach flavored and it was only 4 bucks.Yummy.

As long as Stephanie is working the bar the customer service is great! Wings and beer on Thursday is great

I went here for a Financial presentation with my Young Professional group tonight. The drinks were great! The girl next to me told me it was all gone as I was sucking the residue out of the glass. I had the chicken sandwich and fries. The chicken was grilled perfectly and it was the largest piece I've ever seen. Def going back.

While I was visiting my friend she suggested that we go here for breakfast. It was great. I had a burrito, home potatoes, eggs and the best pancake ever. Forget IHop, Waffle House and any other breakfast chain.   Support local.

I used to go here a couple of years ago in the summer for happy hour. I went out with a few of the ladies last night. Drinks are great and most are 5 bucks during happy hour.  I had Mimosas, 2  carne asada tacos (mini) with chips, dip and guacamole.  Excellent food.   The also have free access to pool, even if you are not a guest.

It was okay. I compare it to a place back home called Zaxby's. The girl suggested that I order the box so that i could taste all that they had. The tenders were normal tenders, the secret sauce helped them out. The coleslaw was not good. The fries were gross. The best part of the meal was the toast and lemonade.

First of all the portions are amazing. I had the Catfish Lunch special. It comes with 3 pieces of nice sized catfish, a heaping fries, white bread lightly toasted and all the condiments you need.  The seasoning in the fries is great and the fish didnt taste "fishy" the way catfish can. It had a nice light coating on it as if it was not soaked in grease.  I went ahead and ordered a small cole slaw and it seems homemade. Very fine and not too sweet or or drowned in mayonnaise.  My drink was Triple Berry KoolAid.  Can't wait to try something else. I hope this place survives because it is hidden in South Phoenix.
