I've been waiting for 15 minutes for the store to open and still nobody has shown up. The hours posted say 9am, and it is now well after 9.

My family and myself have been going to Legacy Dental Group for many years. We still think that Dr. Core is a fine dentist. However, I recently ran into a billing problem with them and have been treated with extreme disrespect, rudeness, and even name calling from their billing person, Stephanie (who happens to be Dr. Core's wife). I have been going through an appeals process between Legacy, and my Insurance company during which time my account was on hold. However I was sent to a collection agency by Stephanie during this time, even though I paid my account in full, which was arranged with their receptionist, Jeremy. Even after paying the account, I am still harassed daily by this collections agency. My suggestion for Dr Core; Don't put your wife in chage of billing. Hire a new billing person to remove any kind of emotional and personal connection between the company and the patient.

I keep coming back. The experience is great. I've had one bad experience, but that was mostly my fault. I came in on my wedding day to get a professional shave, and left looking like I got attacked with a machete. I failed to tell them that I have a few skin tags though, so it was my fault in the end. Overall, this is a great place.

This is my favorite Thai food in town. In a world with Thai restaurants closing their doors all the time, this hidden gem shines bright. Everything is fantastic, down to the perfectly cooked broccoli. I highly suggest trying this west side spot. We need to do all we can to support this local business.
