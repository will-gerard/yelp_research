I started bringing my daughter here a couple months ago (Tempe location).  The doctors and staff are super friendly and professional.  The office is clean and I like that there are separate waiting rooms for sick and healthy children (I am picky when it comes to what is considered clean!) I plan on coming here for a long time and I highly recommend this office.   On another note, I believe people don't understand their insurance well enough to know when something will not be covered and it's not fair to blame the staff  :( Just throwing that out there...

Came here for lunch with co-workers and we were ALL very pleased with both the food and service! Happy to find a Mexican restaurant with a good rice/beans situation. Our server was great. Very nice and prompt with food,drinks and bill. I know this place has been around for a while, wish I would've checked it out sooner now.

Can't say enough about how great this place is.  I've been coming to this bar for about 2 years now. Food is fabulous and atmosphere is always fun. Definitely visit this place sometime....their prices are great also!

Have to give this place 2 stars mainly because the service was bad.  Makes it hard to enjoy a nice breakfast out when the waitress doesn't smile or refill your coffee.  The crepes were alright.  A bit too bland for my taste.  The dessert crepes were probably the best part about this place but I feel like I can just turn around and easily make them at home.  I personally would rather spend my money on more flavorful and complex food where the staff is more pleasant.
