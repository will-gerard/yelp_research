We used to go here a lot and service was always slow, but the other night service was horrible as we waited 5 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before leaving as we had not even received water or any interaction with our server... Very disappointed as their food was always good, but going to try something else next time.

Have been seeing Dr. Dan for about 2 years now and can whole heartedly recommend him! I just left his office after treatment, am feeling so much better after seeing him (which has often been the case) and am disappointed in myself for not leaving him a review before now... He is very knowledgeable and well versed in not only Chiropractic care, but other modalities, including kinesiology. I have seen him for back pain, even skin issues (believe it or not) and am currently seeing him for my knee. All have turned out well with great results and my knee is already feeling better. If you are looking for a great chiropractor that will take care of you with care and understanding, he is the guy to see!

JR was super helpful and I had a great experience working with them. I had an odd object, a piece of quartz, that I wanted them to engrave and he did just that. I spoke with him last week and he said that he was willing to try it, whereas everyone else said no... I went in today and even though you could tell he was very busy, he took the time to come up with the image to engrave, test it on some acrylic and run my piece through while I was there. Looks great and really appreciate the customer service and price. Would happily go back there for any other future needs!

I'd give them zero stars if possible... My girlfriend and I got the groupon and attempted to call them a few weeks prior to the expiration (I know we shouldn't have waited so late, but forgot). Nevertheless, we only received their voicemail every time and both took turns calling them. I explained that we were concerned about the expiration date nearing and would like a call back. We never received a return call and I even called the day the groupon expired one last time. Very unhappy with this waste of money and this company. I can understand that they may have been overwhelmed with the number of calls and business from the groupon, but that does not excuse them from not returning calls... I will tell anyone that I know and asks to avoid this company. At the very least it would be nice to have a refund of our money, but I'll just chalk it up as a lesson learned.

Just went there and was pleasantly surprised with their selection of vegetables and herb starter plants. They also had a large selection of them that were organically grown. Found the employees helpful and even willing to get on the ground and find me the best looking plants from the back. Will definitely be back. They also have a nice selection of pots and decorations, including some really cool Buddha heads.

I can't believe I never reviewed JPG! I was just pulling their information to recommend to a friend that was broken into last night and noticed that... Well, it was a crazy, stressful time when we used them, so that is understandable.  Our current house was in escrow and within a week of closing, had been broken into and the refrigerator stolen, as well as the brand new pool vacuum. When we moved in we did not feel safe, especially knowing that the locks needed to be changed ASAP. We called JPG and he came out to assess the existing alarm system, which was not functioning. He recommended how we change it out and made sure that we were comfortable with the choices. The alarm was installed and we felt much safer within days of contacting him. In addition, we had him install wireless thermostats that we can control through the alarm.com system app. It's so great to be able to control the alarm remotely and your t-stats. I plan on having more alarm monitored smoke detectors installed at a later point. Last note, the monitoring company does a good job and calls you with any alarms and from my research is a common monitoring company used by other alarm providers.   Give these guys a call! You will feel safe and won't be disappointed.

Really good, clean food with some great choices. I was also surprised that it was flavorful; staff was very nice and helpful as well. Honestly, wish there was one closer to us, but will go back again. Oh, and the crispy tofu is pretty damn tasty!
