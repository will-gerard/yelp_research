this used to be my fav steakhouse..until today. i had a korean friend who never been to the US, so we decided to take her to get some american steaks, so we went to the keg. there was a lot of ppl cause it was sat, took about 30+mins to get the food but that was understandable. but the food was not wat i expected as i had before, i ordered a medium rib steak , but it came out well done and burnt on the edges/bones. tasted bad but i kinda finished it cause i dont wanna bother to wait another 30mins to wait. my korean friend also ordered a medium steak but also turned out well done. the service was good they made her a better one and wrote off it from the check. im not giving up yet though cause this is still a pretty good place to eat, maybe next time when i visited here and the steak is good i will give more stars

best chinese noodle in town! unlike japanese ramen(which i really love also), chinese noodle has its own different unquie broth, the one i usually get is the lamb soup, always keeps me warm during the winter,even though in az its pretty short lol. and other cool things about the noodle is they all hand made by the noodle chief, so the bite texture on the noodle is way better than the instant noodles.
