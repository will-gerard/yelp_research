A/C was out. Called G & H, and they showed up in less than an hour. Diagnosed the problem (burned out motor) and had it fixed & running. Afterwards, I called around, and asked what places would charge to replace that particular motor, and G & H was half the price of the big places.  I highly recommend them.

This is also G & H Heating & Air Conditioning:  A/C was out. Called G & H, and they showed up in less than an hour. Diagnosed the problem (burned out motor) and had it fixed & running.

Great dance studio. Wonderful teachers. Hip-Hop, tap, jazz, ballet, pointe, youth to adult. Even home to the Dancin' Dads.  The only issue I have is that during the busiest class times, it can be difficult to find a place to sit and actually watch the kids dance. However, since many studios don't allow that anyways, I guess it is not a bad thing.  Their website is http://www.MadAboutDance.com

Giant is a welcome change of pace. I have been here a couple times, and it is always good.   The important part is the coffee. Not bad. They currently use beans from Four Barrel in SF, CA. They do a pretty good job. If you drink straight espresso shots, this will be a unique taste for you. It is very lightly roasted, with a strong citrus taste, NOT typical of espresso. In a latte or cappuccino, it is balanced by the sweetness of the milk.  I have also had 4 different coffees there, as their line-up does change, based off availability. Don't go for the regular brew. Choose a pour-over instead.  As far as the lobby goes. Again pros and cons. The seats are pretty much immoveable. So if you may have to move seats to accommodate your group. The wall has padded seats with outlets for your laptop needs. The benches in the middle are a little hard on the backside.  However, get there when the front glass is open, and you have an amazing view of what the day can offer. The entire storefront opens up to reveal "the world".  The other cool thing about Giant, or actually this building, is it is a shared space. Kinda like a business within a business, with a nice clothing shop inside (next door). Nice urban feel all around.

This was our second meetup at Mama Gina's. Around 10 people showing up. No problem with reservations (only 3 hours prior), and the exact seating (outside patio) was ready for us.  Just 5 hours earlier, they sent out a special over twitter: "Today only: If you purchase 1 sandwich & a drink you can get a second sandwich free" ( https://twitter.com/mamaginasaz/status/112260246013087744 )  All of us were planning our orders accordingly, so as to make use of the special. Instead of ordering 1 item, I was going to order more, so I could bring some home to my family. DENIED. We were told by the server, and then by management (through the server) that special was only 11a-1pm, and not available. The odd part was the original post was time-stamped around 1:30pm, after, they said, the special ended.   So what did they do to fix the situation? Absolutely nothing. In fact, one member of our party was charged extra for another side of marinera sauce for his garlic knots.  Don't get me wrong, the food and overall service was pretty good, and the food was the main reason this review was not a "1". However, had the special not been "advertised" over social media, we might have chosen a different venue. It almost seemed like a "bait & switch". The worst part was the complete failure to do anything to "remedy" the situation. Had this experience been fixed, or better yet, never occurred, this rating would have been at least a 3, and probably a 4. But for now, I can not overlook the absolute failure of communication between marketing company, restaurant management, and staff.   Here's to hoping they get everything figured out...

Fawn showed up on time & totally professional. I walked with her explaining and showing the pest problem (scorpions & ants). She told me what exactly she could do. As well as told me what I should be expecting as immediate result, and long-term result. She also gave me some pointers on what I can do to prevent them from coming into the house, etc.  I would totally recommend them to anyone needing any kind of pest control service.
