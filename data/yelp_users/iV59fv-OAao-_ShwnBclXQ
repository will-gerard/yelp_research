The best chicken fried steak  and my husband had the best brisket ever. It was all so so so tender and savory. It was heaven in my mouth. Last but not least, I had the pecan pie.. I had to have a second slice. I have never had better pie in my life, and I have had a lot of different pies from places knows for pie.

I must say I am super disappointed with this place. My brother got dry, dark, artificial tasting mash potatoes. My wild rice was super dry. My asparagus was super burnt. Enough said. I will not be returning. I expected more for the prices. Actually I don't ever expect dry and burnt food no matter what the price is.

Must say I had such a great lunch there and so did my other 11 family members. We were impressed and we didn't expect such good food. Everything had such great flavor! Even the desserts! For the prices, the food is so tasty and such quality!

Quality, super super juicy, tender, original burgers. The patties are thick and super juicy. They are flame broiled which adds a crisp on the sides of the pattie and adds a slight light char taste. The buns are super soft and the sesame seeds on it have a toasty flavor brought out from being put on the grill. It was a super authentic burger. A burger that you want to take your time eating because it's so good. The burgers are a bigger size, no small little slider size. If I want an original burger this is the place that comes to mind. Just the one double burger itself was super satisfying and filling. I am definitely coming again.

The pecan pie was sweet and rich just the way I like them. Perfect amount of filling and crust.

I loved the fact that upon seating I was served with some really good, off the chart corn bread.  I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and ranch beans. The protein was super tender and savory. I personally enjoyed the brisket more. The Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy just the way I like them. The ranch beans were on the sweeter side but some good beans all together. When the receipt was brought to me for payment I received complementary donuts which I thought was so awesome. They sure know what to do to get clients crawling back in.  My friend and I personally felt like the server we had didn't want to be on the job so that was unfortunate.

I wasn't that hungry when I came so I ordered there Cesar salad. I was expecting a pretty bland salad but I got the opposite. It was the best salad I have ever had! So much texture, flavors, and deliciousness in every single bite! The nuts and the oats added with the blue cheese just finished it off perfectly. The chicken served in it was also so moist.  I recommend this salad to anyone.

Table tops etc really upset me with there work. I showed them what I wanted with pictures and they said they can do that same exact thing but did not deliver. I showed them specific vases I wanted them to use and they did not use what I showed them on the day. I am really upset and I wish I knew better. After the whole situation a lot of people told me that they were not a good place to go to. I thought that because they had 5 stars it would be a good place.. It was probably just family reviewing them because all the reviews are in the same time frame. They charge you for the water and for the fridge use for the flowers.. They really over charge in general. I do not recommend this place to anyone. They use as little flowers as possible to save money in there pocket. If anyone wants to see for themselves I have the pictures of what I asked for and what she made.. It's a disgrace. My mom, aunt, and the bridal party were shocked.

Definitely my favorite protein smoothie. The texture is phenomenal and the flavors are so abnormally delicious. I always get the peanut butter, strawberry, banana protein smoothie. It is definitely out of the ordinary.

I love in and out . It's always the to go place for a quick quality juicy burger at little cost. And they use fresh ingredients and use never frozen patties . The French fries are crisp and thin and perfectly salted as well.

This is the best Mexican burrito/enchilada that I have ever had. It was quality beef, rice, and beans.. It was also fulfilling and more then enough. The burrito itself was huge! This will always be the first place on my mind when I want to eat delicious Mexican food.

I had the eggs Benedict with pulled pork and guacamole on top of a biscuit. It was the best egg Benedict I have ever had. I would recommend it to anyone. The sauce that comes over the eggs is so delicious, creamy, and savory. They are cooked perfectly.. The scramble browns compliments the entree perfectly because of it's cheddar cheese, hash brown, and bacon combination. I would recommend this place to anyone.

The service was extraordinary and the food was amazing !! I ordered the pretzel fondue which was to die for. The cheese was unbelievable flavorful and creamy and the pretzels were melting in my mouth. I ordered the turkey pastrami which was pure goodness. The pretzel bread was so so soft biting into the sandwhich. There was also Atleast 50 grams of protein in the sandwhich itself, it was filled with turkey. The sauce used in this hunk of sustenance was to die for. I would recommend it to the protein lovers. All those who pick up weights :)

I must say, I was impressed by how savory and delicious the food was! I got the new york burger: one of the best burgers I ever had. It was to die for! All the ingredients were well balanced. The pastrami in the burger was so tender and juicy. The coleslaw had a lot of great flavor to it, along with the tasty sauce.   I really enjoyed the French fries. Some of my favorite french fries.   My husband had the Cali burger. The cheese in it looked so luscious on top of the patties, bacon, and avocado that I had to try it. I definitely recommend the Cali and new york burger. The bread, ingredients, and protein were all incredibly delicious and my taste buds can concur! ;)

I had the beef brisket, pork, and chicken sampler. I had sweet potato fries and coleslaw on the sides. The coleslaw is not something I would order again. The sweet potatoes were good. It is the waffle fries that are full of flavor and they remain crunchy. The beef brisket was my favorite out of all the meats. The one I finished the first as well.. The chicken was second most moist and tasty and lastly the pork. The potato salad was alright .

I had the teriyaki chicken veggie bowl. I couldn't wait to try this place out because of all the raving reviews about how good the chicken is especially. The chicken was very tough, hard to chew on. The veggies underneath the chicken were filled with oil and  had no flavor. I was very disappointed.  I keep on trying to find one thing I was impressed by in my meal, but there is nothing.

This place had some of the best drinks. The Nutella iced mocha and the iced vanilla lavender mocha are to die for! If you love your chocolate I recommend the iced Nutella mocha. The environment is very urban and chill. I would definitely come again.

I came with two of my girlfriends and the food didn't have anything specifically special about it.. I could of added better flavoring making it at home. My salmon was dry. My friends thought the same about their dish. Definitely not worth the money they are asking for it. My friend Cara got some pretty dry chicken as well with her crab filling. This is not a place I am interested in coming to again.

It's all so good. All. All. Please try the best subs. I love the cheddar BBQ brisket and the Italian subs. I always get a cookie and a brownie when I come as well. Some of my favorite chocolate chip cookies. They steam the bread and I like the fact that there is more meat then bread in the subs.

Cash only . She perfected my eyes brows in a way I never thought possible. She fixed them into the perfect shape and for some reason they look thicker then they did before .. I am so happy with Leena. She herself has perfect eyebrows.

The experience at this restaurant is definitely one of the best. I had the risotto and my husband had the gnocchi meal which were both so lively in flavor. Every bite we had was so delicious and savory. I also had the fountain of youth cocktail  The fountain of youth cocktail was definitely one of the best drinks I've tried and I can definitely see why it has that name. The waiter we had "mark" really knew his drinks and food. He was so wonderful with my husband and I. The manager herself was super kind and made sure we were happy with the service. I must say that we will definitely return.

I came here this morning for breakfast and I already got a bad vibe when I entered. The customer service was not very nice and they treated us Like garbage. The soups are not good. Very high in sodium and the chili is the worst chili I have ever had. The corn bread was not moist. The chobb salad was very good though. I do not recommend this place though.

I got the mushroom enchilada and it was so good. It had black beans, corn, cheese, a mango salsa that was super tasty. The creamy sauce was super savory and more on the sweet side. It was a good sweet though. I definitely recommend it. The service was phenomenal. We always had our drinks refilled and were always helped out when needed.

My favorite ice cream shop. They have such unique flavors that are rich and extremely tasty. First time I came I had the Cocoa Puffs and fruity pebbles.. I love the cereals and the ice cream had the same exact taste but in rich creamy ice cream form. The second time I had the flavors of my two favorite snacks: peanut butter and jelly and chocolate cake batter. The ice cream once again tasted like the exact food but in an ice cream rich consistency. I am very impressed by this place. There is always a line when I come and always people dining in on the patio in the front.

Real food, real BBQ, and top notch quality. I am overly impressed by all the food here. I got the sample platter with every meat as well as every single side item on the menu.   I am going to start with the juicy fatty beef brisket. I never eat fat, but the fat on this fatty beef brisket is not your typical fat consistency and texture, it was a savory, flavorful glaze that melted right in your mouth. The fat belonged with the top notch quality protein, you do not want it off. I loved eating the fatty brisket with the beans. The brisket was so good that it did not call for any sauce, rather the baked beans complimented it perfectly.   The sausage had the perfect crunch biting into it and had excellent consistency. The flavors were so savory and had a spicy after taste. They make the sausages there and add pork in them. I really enjoyed the grits with the sausage. I liked that the cheddar jalapeño grits had a slight spice to them from the jalapeños. They had a light cheddar flavor which was good because it was not over powering.  The turkey was beyond any turkey I have ever had. It was not only moist but it had a potent hickory taste. I never imagined that turkey can taste so good and have such a perfect smoky flavor.  The beef short ribs were so juicy and tender, falling right off the bone. The ribs were super flavorful and had the perfect smokiness..   No place in Arizona beats this place, they are definitely specialists in what they do. The owner and the staff made sure that our needs were meant and made sure our visit was the most satisfying.. The staffs friendliness was definitely a 5 star rating as well. The 2 hour wait in line was worth it. Next time I am bringing a chair to sit in though. It wasn't fun standing.

The owner of benoculars is super nice and understanding of what is wanted . He does a super job cleaning and was recommended by a friend to me. I am so glad I was told about this company because I was not disappointed.   He cleaned my carpet after a huge bridal shower I had with green clean products. The carpet was super filthy and he cleaned it too perfection, literally brand new. The green clean products are   nontoxic Environmental safe. I was happy to know it was non toxic due to the children always coming in and out of the house.

I had the pulled pork sandwich. It had a variety of fresh flavors in it. The pulled pork was super savory. I can tell it was marinated for a while. The marinated radish and carrots added so much flavor to the sandwich and gave it an amazing texture . I must say that the bread was the perfect thickness and so easy to bite in. Perfect exterior crunch and interior was soft and fresh.

Pretty nice place and clean as well. It has a  New York theme. Love the smell of the food when I walk in.  I got the wreck on deck sandwich. It had the most tender roast beef and plenty of it in that sandwich. The fries were crispy and delicious as well, some of the best!!

Such flavorful burgers..   I had the smoke shack and it was so savory and delicious! You can tell that the burger is quality from the first bite you take. It was super juicy and the thick bacon really stood out to me with its outstanding flavor. This burger is in a category of its own. I can't compare it to other places.   The cheese on the fries was so creamy and good.. I was not expecting the cheese to have such mind blowing flavors. I definitely recommend the fries with cheese.   The custards are so tasty and have so so much texture because of the tid bits of deliciousness they combine in the custard. I had some of the mallow monsoon and camel shack.. The camel shack had the banana creme pie combined with the salted caramel sauce in there giving it a unique flavor of its own, I just couldn't get enough of it. The mallow monsoon had the delicious chocolate truffle cookie dough with sugar cone cookie pieces.. Amazing... I liked both of them so much but when I go again I would get the camel shack because of its unique out of this world flavors.  Overall, there is no doubt I am making this place a regular for getting burgers.
