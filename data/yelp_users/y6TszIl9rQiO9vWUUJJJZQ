Plazma Rocks! Best place in CenPho to grab a spot at the bar, patio, or table. I say that cause there is always room. It's a shame the place is rarely packed, because this very cool neighborhood bar has a lot going for it.  Great bartenders! A supper friendly owner, and the best drink prices north of Van Buren. There is always a drink special and lots to look at with all the TV's and music Videos, a few old school Pinball machines, darts, a big stage and a pool table.  I like going for some of the drag shows, this is the type of place with newbies and the old standards like Celia, Miss Ebony, and Phedra.  I think ther is karaoke a few times a week and strippers on Saturday nights, I have to get back for that.   On my last visit we were shocked because even though the parking lot was empty there was a fun lively crowd inside. We found out that alot of people walk over from around the hood, and from the huge uber-gay apartment complex next door.  I dont live close enough to walk and I dont drink and drive so I dont get in as often as I would like to, but the last time I was there was 5 Stars! Thanks guys for making me feel welcome.  jv

It has been months since I was last here but they haven't skipped a beat.  From the immediate attention from the hostess, and our server was flawlessly just steps behind us as we cozied into the best booth in the place.   Dinner was casual yet way more than that, I wanted it to be perfect and it was just as it was at the Parlor last weekend and again last night it was perfection at Hillstone. I expected no less at either spot, yet at my 2 favorite restaurants in Az both places exceded my expectaions.  Hillstone cuts NO corners ever!!! Even a burger, French dip and artichochoke dip arrive perfectly timed and perfect in every way.  Whats the secret? and why are there just a few restaurants like it?!?!

I go to Panda for the same reason I drink Cheap Chardonnay, and eat chain pizza, or get a steak at Applebee's, It gets the job done. When I have great Rombauer Chardonnay, a authentic pizza from Mozza or an amazing meal at Mesa Grill, or the best hot and sour soup in the world at MY China, it's just that much better. I have had Martin Yan and Bobby Flay cook me dinner, yet in general I have a pretty good impression of Panda Express. They get the job done. Most Panda's that I have been too are pretty tasty fresh and generous. I can always count on that at the very least.  "Pandas standard" is usually good enough, but not here. I have tried several times and I am ALWAYS DISAPOINTED  and shake my head as to why this location is always so bad!!!  Today my meal was cool, a little past it's prime and super small portions. too add insult to failure there was no Hot Mustard... AGAIN.   I like the orange chicken dipped in hot mustard, It's so cravable, but without hot mustard is just not as good. The last 2 times here they were out and I almost asked first, but I had faith that surely they couldn't be out again!   This location is PANDAS BLACK EYE!!!!!!

There are shenanigans going in in The Bingo Hall. Today was the second time I was playing when an extra ball was in the hoper. The first time the manager Chris didn't handle it very well. Today the players were more vocal and it resulted in refunds! A little better outcome, but this is a world class casino with very high stakes bingo. Mistakes like this should never happen.

Haven't been in years.  I was amazed that although It's been years since my last visit here, not much has changed.   The massive ficus tree at the entry looked as good as ever and I noticed that the landscaping surrounding the building were nearly perfect. I also noticed the patio was under utilized, just a bunch of plastic patio furniture scattered about. This might be my only beef with this place. They should fix it up, cover and set those tables, and add some shimmering lights. It might have been so because it was a Monday night but I don't remember the patio ever being used to its amazing potential.  We were greeted promptly and with a warm friendly welcome. It felt so inviting like we come every week. A nice old school booth was camp for the next hour or so. Mature service was prompt friendly, and professional, Its a nice change from the 19 year olds in Scottsdale that don't care about what they are doing or serving.   as far as the food goes everything started with some fresh baked bread and foil wrapped butters. soup and salads preceded main dishes and there they were, the sliced canned beets and as expected a pool of a delicious tangy red wine Italian dressing topped by Ice berg olives and those slice beets. Gratefully some things never change!  Main dishes included Stuffed eggplant that was covered with a half pound of mozzarella and swimming in marinara, it smelt delicious! My buddy had a $15.00 pizza after adding 3 toppings, $15 10 inch pies are becoming the norm around town so it didn't seem too out of line and 1/3 of that pizza made its way home for a snack later. My pasta dish was called Half and Half and included delicious beef ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce, the sauce was as good as my own, and the pasta was cooked to absolute perfection.  Deserts were declined, and our garden party soon came to an end. Thank you's and good bye's came from all directions and that's old school at its best!!!  Riazzi's is that touch of nostalgia and the part of Tempe you always want to remember after so much around town is building up, modernizing and going corporate.

We popped in to Crazy Jims last night before a concert at Comerica.  At first glace at the front door it looked like a counter diner, as we didn't notice the large dining room on the side. The big room was a nice surprise! It wasn't a beautiful space, it looks very efficient, and kind of like a corporate cafeteria dining room.  About the efficient part, the staff certainly was!!!! when we were seated the restaurant was at about 25% full and by the time we left the lobby was packed with people waiting for tables. What impressed me so much was the team work going on here, there was never a service misstep and nobody looked frazzled as the restaurant quickly filled. The kitchen held its own as well as everything we ordered was tasty fresh and hot.  JIM if you are reading this thank your lucky stars that you have such a crew!!!! You have a team most restaurateurs only dream about.

Truely one of Americas greatest gay bars!!! Yes it's a bar not a night club. People of all shapes, size, age, and personalities. if you are cool you are welcome.  It's a bar so expect to find drinkers, some of them never go home, some go every day, some once a week and some like me that have been enjoying this place for 25 years! Nutown has always been that friendly place to grab an Ice Cold Beer on the Cheap, It's always been the closest bar to ASU Main, It has always been that place with the best holiday decorations, and yes it's a great place to cruise.  What is NEW at Nu Towne is a bright new refreshed interior, uniform clad ultra freindly bartenders, and a renewed sence of community pride.  It's busy on the weekends especially Sunday afternoons, so if you go on off hours bring your own party or expect to be welcomed into conversation with the regulars and bartenders, shoot some pool, or you might just get cruised  Hungry? It's next to Honey Bears BBQ, The bartenders will fix you a corn dog, and on Sundays enjoy excellent grub on the patio. Great food & prepared to order, things like grilled chicken, steaks, burgers and chili. The procedes from The food goes to local charities and groups.  If you havnt been ever or in awhile then dont wait!!! drop in and check out whats OLD and whats New at The New Nu towne Saloon.  JV

This place is great, it always has been!!!  I am going to start with service, It could not have been any better for the environment, fast friendly, accommodating, and just kind. Not gushy or desperate, just all around good especially from the cashier, who might be the manager or owner, and the guy with the FREE CHIPS and Salsa. "if you would like more of either, just let me know" Wow that alone makes me want to come back.  My lunch was exceptional, with 2 big stuffed shredded beef tacos with rice and beans with a Pepsi for less then 10 bucks. The tacos were as good as I remember and the rice and beans were just the right size, along with some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.   The place itself was welcoming for me because every detail in the lobby was perfect from beer cooler to counters, the floors were spotless and the beverage station was well stocked and gleaming.  If you are wondering if this should be on your list, I say YES. its casual and you order at the counter but there is beer and Margaritas so enjoy a little casual done right!

What you get here most of the time is a great friendly neighborhood dive bar. By that I mean pretty good efficient service at either of the bars, great drink and beer prices, and a place to sit and relax.   The place just got spruced up with a larger covered patio, and some much needed repairs and TV's inside. It looks great, and I really wasn't expecting them to re-do the bathrooms but I would love it if they had lowered the urinals a few inches.  Most times it's a regular cast of character's with plenty of industry folk looking to gather with co-workers to revel or bitch about the night, but this is the perfect outlet for that, and close to home for so many of my pals.  Sometimes there is food (for just a tip) but usually not. There is plenty of bike parking and a huge parking lot to the east, but please be safe on your bike and don't drink and operate a motor vehicle.  Be warned around Christmas time after the decorations go up it gets very crowded, and usually a line to get in. It at times becomes a Scottsdale freak show with limos and tour busses everywhere and lots of really drunk people trying to have a good time but completely out of there element.

I have been dining here for years.  Although the food is always tasty, the portions have gotten much smaller over time and of course prices have gone up. After my last meal there the perceived value was shattered. Tiny portions of everything from chicken to potatoes and vegies. The avocado salad was kind of a joke and certainly not shareable.   I think the wine is overpriced because they serve a 4 ounce pour and at 11 bucks, a small glass of a grocery store Chardonnay is a bit much.  Service is always predictable and by that I mean fast very fast as in eat and go please. It's rarely kind and personable but at the same time never bad, because the severs are obviously trained to turn there tables professionally.  This use to be my go to restaurant in Old town, but I find myself choosing others now. I wish Bandera was great again.

I have lots of reviews of Pizza locals and I know it's odd to start a review for a Micro Brew Pub with a pizza review but here goes.  I have made thousands and thousands of pizzas, and felt qualified to say that The T Rex at Papago is the Best Pizza in town. I have been saying that for years! I qualify that by saying it has to be the large, not the small. I will now say that it has to be eaten there.   Recently we got one for take out and it was just barely OK- Something happened and I am not sure what! It wasn't burnt or raw, it wasn't cold, it wasn't as generous as I remember but It wasn't returnable, it was just OK.  The Pub is great, tons of wood and on the funky side. Lots of reach-in beer coolers to grab beer to go or enjoy in house. (let the bartenders open it for you) at a cost. I usually just stick to the great selection of drafts.  Service is always fine but occasionally you have to compete with a full rail of irregular regulars, but the bartenders here are fair and will get to ya.  I hate to think that all these years I have been eating that large T-Rex Pizza with my beer goggles on, but alas I think that might just be it. From now on I will skip the take out and have my pizza with a few goblets or pints, and try and sneak away before sunrise.

Why has it taken me years to YELP my favorite watering hole? IDK?!?!  First and foremost service here is great, always attentive and I have never had to tell a bar tender my name, ever... they just know it, even the rare occasional with a new Tender. Until I started mixing up my drink order I usually had a beer before my butt hits the barstool.  This is a British Pub/ Neighborhood Bar. I wouldn't say authentic British but just British enough. There are plenty of great English dishes, and as many great American Pub Fare. I had to make the servers not allow me to order the Mac and Cheese more then once a week, and that's as often as I would get it if Morgan didn't take a day off from time to time. One week she left a note for the others so I had a salad.  Wings, Skins, Fries and Rings, a pretty darn good burger and some daily specials more then round out the menu. If you do order the mac and cheese, add bacon and green chili's...trust me!!! Food til 11 sharp most days and a little latter on Friday and Saturdays.  Pool tables, real darts and Golden Tee, and The most popular Bar trivia in town can distract you from the day you just had, or just kick back and let this fine team of servers just get you what you need. The music can be hit or miss and this might be my only beef with this place, sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's not, but It's from a juke box so you can always pick a few of your own favorites.  Prices are great and there is always something on special, I would say drinks and beers are about half the price of  those served in the clubs just south of Camleback rd in Old Town.  Take my advice and BOP in sometime and see for yourself South Scottsdale's oldest best kept secret.

It's a little bike shop in the hood, and they have been fixing flats and stuff for me for years. I also frequent a few other bike shops that I like better but not as close to home. Service is always fast and prices are on the "fair" side.  Bob always seems a bit cranky -no pun intended, but he is competent and quick with the repairs.  I noticed some nice bikes for a great price today, I think I might go back for an upgrade.  Does a bike shop have to be a friendly place??? No not really, but the ones I like the best are. Take a look at the small well priced selection of Raleigh bikes, and for quick service just off the green belt this place is a great option.

I stopped in for dinner Sunday night because I wanted something fresh and healthy.  I sure was happy I chose to visit an old favorite. I actually have been eating at Boston Market for many years, We would go to the valleys original location in Tempe, and back then it was a great place. Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south. I chalked that up to growth and just chose other dining options.  On last nights visit I was greeted by a friendly young lady who had that great "we are happy you are here" smile. I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.  After ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier.   The meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.  Places like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night. Well somebody's doing there job and THAT'S FRESH!!!!  I recommend Boston Market if you have never been or haven't been in a while. It has to be the best meal in town under 10 bucks!

Always great! & almost always very busy!   There are so many great things to choose from and I have that to look forward to.  My last few visits have been awesome once I got my order in, that's the hard part as there are 2 order stations and each one is for it's own items. First timers will be confused, as I was as the lines snake through the tiny grocery lined dining room. stick with it and focus, as the payoff is amazing  It's ultra casual for sandwiches and Italian dishes this good. Quality sliced meats and cheeses are priced well and the specialty grocery items like San Marzano tomatoes and great Italian wine abound.  This is one of those hole in the wall gems! trust me and check this place out.

Everthing about this recent stay at The Riv was top notch!!! Heck I LOVED the comps although I am not sure why they went so far, but I was nice to be treated so well.  The Hotel itself is very retro cool. It kind of reminded my of part cruise ship and part Fountain Blue Miami, pre renovations. If this Hotel were in almost any other city in the world it would be the best in town.   The Riviera however has to compete with all the other Mega Resorts in Vegas. Well if you really want a huge casino with 1000's of people the The Mirage, Ceasars, and Mandalay Bay are for you, but I really enjoyed the exceptional service throughout the property, and with out the mayhem I experience walking throuh a few of these other places this week.  My room in The Monico Tower was recently redecorated with new carpet, paint. art bedding, and stone bathrooms. But the beds alone made my stay so comfy, omg were they nice, better then home and that says alot!!!  I have no negetives other then spotty internet service, and I did discuse that with the resort manager, (yes The Big Cheese) talked with me about his hotel.  Service, food, shows, entertainment, casino, comps, and comfort all deserve 5 stars!!!  I know its off the "main" strip but its location has its own bennifits. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Vegas and at a GREAT price, STAY and or PLAY HERE!!!!

It seems like it was just yesterday, but it was more like 25, or 26 years ago when I first stepped foot inside what was once called Lawrence of Oreganos! It was opening day then and the next few weeks tables were easy to garner but that changed, as "Oregano's" started to earn its place in the future history of famous Arizona Restaurants. It began to get tougher and tougher to get a table even as we watched this tiny Bistro expand to a mini compound, and soon to be pretty a darn successful regional chain.  Although I have enjoyed hundreds of meals with friends and family during the last 3 decades, and waited as many hours for a table, it has been years since I have been in. That changed last night and although tradition was shattered, I was stoked to be immediately whisked to a big table in the corner with NO WAIT!   So on to last nights visit, I first notice that the dining experience starts in the driveway, the building looks great, and music was in the air. upon entering our greeting was welcoming and efficient. The walk through the dining room was fun, and although a little Disneyesque, it felt like we were entering and old time, big city Italian restaurant, It's pretty, vibrant and smelt delicious.  We were lead to a great big table in the corner and menus placed for us so we could sit and stare at the wall, we took the initiative to scoot around to the back so we could people watch and take in this neat space and vibrant energy. Soon into dinner and coincidentally good friends were seated across from us. That was nice, and its casual enough that standing and talking for a few minutes wasn't a problem for this casual environment.  My buddy said "wings" I got this, I said... Italian Gold with a side of the hot sauce were ordered with our beverages. The wings arrived late, after the sandwiches, but they still tasted EXACTLY as I remembered. Delicious. I snuck the order in with beverages cause I knew they took a while. I would have loved to start with them rather then eat along side of entrées. Although blamed on long cooking times ( I knew that) this was the only service mis-step. The rest of our service was so good that we left a fat tip for our friendly server.  Overall everything we ordered was delicious, and prepared well, with the exception of the Cole slaw and Giardinara that came with our sandwiches. The slaw was so finely chopped I thought it was Ice berg lettuce. It was Ice cold and had a unique flavor and I ate it all, it was a more visual and textural thing, and the Giardinara may have been from the bottom of the barrel or just not as I remembered, It was all okra and peppers, just all dark green, Not really a problem just not great. It was especially nice to see that prices are still very reasonable and portions every bit as big as always.  I am not sure why it's been so long since I have been, but It wont be long, till I get back.

What The Heck happened to this restaurant?!?  Reservations were made 30 minutes ahead and we arrived at the agreed appointed time yet even in a half full restaurant our table was not ready. We waited ten minutes and a few of us gravitated to the bar. The bartender was pretty efficient and had a great attitude. He was having fun and still did his job well.  Once seated everyone mentioned the wobbly chairs and surprise the restaurant wasn't full. We sat for awhile and chatted about the day. Drink orders were taken and before they were delivered to the table our server tried to get our brunch orders, The only problem with that is we had yet to see a menu.  Our server seemed kind and polite, but very stressed out. she was often seen "running" around the dining room. Orders were taken and food delivered, and that's where my true disappointment set in, my lunch just wasn't very good. It was a salad that was just lackluster. honestly this could have easily been served next door a Denny's. The salad was also missing promised menu items like ranch and cheese. It appeared that sour cream was subbed for the ranch. Sorry, I don't send food back ever, and I was starving so I dug in. it was really just OK.  We got our checks and nobody said "That was good" The place never did fill even on Pride parade day. I use to love this place and as I was leaving my mind raced of all the great spots we didn't go to for brunch.

It was a warm sunny Sunday, and with out of town friends in tow, I chose The Vig. Having never been there it was chosen solely by reputation and lots of good word of mouth. We also wanted someplace to enjoy with a patio. We self parked and were quickly greeted by the valet who wanted the keys and offered a ticket, that's fine, and he was very polite.  Upon entering My first impression was great, they offered a 45 minute wait for a table, that didn't seem to bad, as the Vig had a great Vibe. The live band on the patio mid day Sunday was a nice touch, and something not seen most places.  The host suggested our large group take the corner of the bar as she was about to seat the girls sitting there. That also was a nice touch. The ambiance was great and the lively atmosphere kind put me at ease and in the party mode at the same time. The First snag came with the party mode because bar service was sluggish at best, and I cant stand to wait for a drink or compete with the regulars and hot chicks for drinks. Thankfully after the regulars and hot chicks got there drinks we were served. We all wanted margaritas and wine, and come to find out both were on special. NICE and worth the wait !!!. Once seated in a tight booth by the door we ordered appetizers and lots of them, most were good, but the tandoori flat-bread was stellar an easy 10, but the sliders hovered near a 5 on a ten point scale. I wasn't fast enough for a taco but heard they were great. Why have I waited so long to get to The Vig? I have no Idea, but it will only be a week before I return.

First and foremost! This store is very friendly!!! And everyone should be so lucky to have a Food City close by.  This is not a SUPER MARKET! it's a FOOD MARKET.   What's great about this Market is lots of REAL FOOD, Beans, Rice, Roasted Chiles, Fresh Produce, Dry Pasta, a Deli loaded with hot Mexican Food, Rotisserie Chicken, Cheese, Ice Cream, Beer, Liquor, a Carnisaria (sp) Meat Counter and Great Daily and Weekly specials.   Prices on certain items are always great especially the above mentioned items. Prices are regular and/or seldom on special on Name brand Items, and over Packaged and Processed foods. That just keeps things real.  OK, I will admit that the produce doesn't always sit long at home, but last week I had some avocados that went south too fast, and they were super quick to exchange them with ease. If you just shop once a week and load up the fridge this might not be the store for you, but if you can hit the daily specials and pick up fresh tortillas a few times a week then why wouldn't you.  Over all the store is clean, with great cashiers, department clerks, and baggers. They need more hand baskets and grocery carts but if that's MY only gripe, stop in and grab an armful of fresh food.

I have been in hundreds of Circle K stores and in some locations hundreds of times.  This by far is the best location. It's always clean and well stocked, but most important, the staff here is professional, and friendly!!!  I am always amazed by the contrast of The Circle K closest to my house on Roosevelt/ Continental rd at Scottsdale rd That location is so poorly run with disheveled employees, dirty and cluttered store, never stocked well, incorrect price tags, overflowing trash cans outside the front doors and odd hours. they would get 1 star from me.  These 2 stores although less then 2 miles apart can not have the same manager.

I have to admit I have seen far fewer movies going into this new year, and that's because of the closing of Harkins Camleview 5. I was a regular 1 or 2 movies a week between FS7 and Camleview5, but after 1 visit to the NEW CamleViewFS I just gave up.  That is until I discovered Tempe Market Place Harkins. My matinee ticket was a fair $7.50 that's $6.50 less then the shinny new digs in The Fashion Square Mall. (a few blocks from home) I also enjoyed great parking with excellent passenger drop off. It's surrounded by a great selection of casual quick service restaurants like Chipotle, Cold Stone, Mad Greens, Paradise Bakery and a bunch of others including Cocktails at Bar Louis and Ghinges Grill just steps away.   As I entered this massive theater lobby I was already in a good mood because the Very funny and happy man that sold me the tickets was quick, efficient, and gets good customer service. Apon entering the ticket taker had a big smile and quick directions to our theater. Concessions were quick because of the numerous stations open. Stadium seating and comfy chairs, with an ample size screen and great sound.  I hope to see the art house movies from the original Camleview find there way this direction, being so close to one of the biggest university's in the country it only makes sense.    This is a very well run movie theater!!!

There is lots to love about this place, and I want to start with the service, attentive, friendly, and gracious. Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night, that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served.  About the food we planned the visit around Cien Agaves terrific Happy hour, so there were lots of tico tacos $1.50 ea and half price appitizers on the table, rounded out by a few entrees. Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.  They have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!  Inside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting. In Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.  I MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been passing this place for years. I knew then as it is now a neighborhood bar with barely a neighborhood.  Upon entering I found it a little more casual than I expected. maybe it was lighting it could have been because it was nearly empty on a Saturday night.  We had a small gathering of friends that stopped for a beer after a birthday dinner, so we didn't eat here. The menu looks like what you would expect, its just bar food. probably great enough to cure the beer munchies.  What I liked best was the service, the bartender was engaging, welcoming and efficient. he had a kind hearted spirt most great bartenders have.   This is a regular spot for my buddies that live in the apartments next door. I am already looking forward to returning with them to catch the beer munchies.

It was nice to get back to this old favorite. it's been a few months but Im always happy to stop in. I think the place has lost its personal touch it once garrnered, and service has never been it's stong point, but It's the great food that comes out of the kitchen that I love so much. Tried somthing new tonight, it was the meat lovers pizza (odd name) but it sure was tasty! and I have never been without the chopped salad, possibly the very best salad in town. We were in a rush and got in and out in about 50 minutes. Thats pretty good for dinner on a friday night.

I waited  at the bar to try and buy a drink after work tonight. I waited and waited and waited. The bartender was so slow, and preoccupied with friends that I never did get to buy a drink. The bar back was also no help. I wasn't the only one waiting! and I know I wasn't the only one pissed the bartender was inept. 15 minutes with a $20 in my hand, leaning into the bar trying to make eye contact with the bartender is simply unacceptable. Keep it, as I kept my 20 bucks!

I really like Georges, and it's just around the corner from my house. I almost always eat in, but the last time I had take out and the fries had suffered. Boy did I wish at that moment I hade gotten the Greek salad instead of fries.   The Gyros are always great, though unbalanced as the meat to veggie ratio is a tad off consistently. I don't want to ruin it for the meat lovers because it's off in favor of meat, and needs a bit more on the veggies, and sauce. They are always the same, every time, and I guess that's a very good thing, at least you know what you are in for.  It's a big menu with pastas burgers, salads and appetizers, plenty to choose from. although I always seem to stick to my favorites.  Service is always friendly, just like most favorite neighborhood joints that care about the customers, no complaints there.  The only real gripe is no matter how busy or how slow they are it's always 10 or 15 minutes to get your order. Again very consistent, so you know what to expect.   George, if you are reading this know that my critics are sincere and I think you have a great place! thanks again, as always!

Spoiler alert--- It's a Chain Restaurant!!!! But this might just be the best run chain restaurant company in America. It seems nothing has been forgotten, a solid well rounded menu, tasty well seasond meals, attracive well kept salad bar, better then very clean restrooms, well trained and informed service staff, prices from fair to great, great beverage program, and nice tastefull decor. I really like this place and it has been my go to restaurant for a few years. I am not big on chains, but this particular one is great.  For what it is, it's a solid 5 star place.

I have been hanging out at The Door for a few weeks now, I think this is a great gay bar with plenty of seating and great generous bartenders. The place is very loungey and even the regulars make you feel welcome. They seem to be pros at promotion and marketing because there is somthing going on every night. I have been a big fan of their 3 4 1 happy hour on fridays and Thursday they have  a great strip show. but I also like the slow nights were we can just hang out drink and talk. So much for Saturdays the palce was packed last night with a new night called Synthetic. The had several DJ's, a new sound system and the coolest video screens I have ever seen. This is a complete transformation from previous quiet Saturdays. I not complaining I like the new high energy tecno pop, and the very mixed crowd proved it's a college bar. Next week I will bring my straight friends. If you have ever been to The Door in the past you know about the back entrance, however these guys kept that area a secret till last night. The long graffitied hallway with video monitors was a very dramatic entrence to a club I hardely recognized.  We all took part in the drink special, they serve long Islands and other drinks in those old fashioned wine carafes, very cool !!! my 6 dollar drink went a long way. I am gald to see The Door get better and better, and I look forward to more in the future. TB

Great location in one of the greatest parks in the world! It's just steps to The Scottsdale Civic Center Mall and steps to the Heart of Old Town on Brown and Main Streets.  Great selection of beers including lots of choices from Phoenix Ale Brewery. A ton of whisky and bourbons and some other great Top shelf spirits. Prices are good and very fair for this amazing location.  NO FOOD and it almost cost them a star But heck they do every thing else right and there are a few other great options for excellent food near by. I would be tempted to bring a bag of corn chips and some salsa, or maybe some take out from Capriati's, but I would check first.  Service is always great!!! Super friendly with welcomes and goodbye's every time!

This has always been my favorite bike shop!!!  I remember the days when they were west of Mill on "the otherside of the tracks" but I really like the newer digs on Rural rd closer to my place.  Service, prices, and selection have never been a problem. The problem occured last week, and it was a doosie! It was when an owner stepped up to the plate with concern and compasion, that made me fell better about what had happened, what happened wasnt as important as the fact that it was resolved.  Thats what you get with a shop like this. Great repair prices, nice selection, and real bike people. JV

I am not a fan of Singh Farms, I bought way to much of their "best" composted soil. The results were poor the first year and after amending the soil the second garden season results were a little better now on season 3 and the garden is thriving.   I have heard from others that the compost from Singh is high in salt. I would recommend having the soil tested before a large purchase. There are also other options altogether.  I have lost confidence in the product here so I'm out.

Without a Doubt The Very Best Pizza in Town.  There are higher profile over-hyped places in this town to wait to get in, and then treated like you need to finish and go. The Parlor is so far from that! Service is part moms house part Ritz Carlton. It's the most profesional and well trained staff I have ever come across. The place seems to run so smooth that you hardly notice the exceptional service from ALL sides. Never have I been treated so well, and so well guided through a menu, meal and dining experience in any restaurant, anywhere.  What won my heart was the food, solid appitizers, salads, and solid wine list and OMG the pizzas! well they are serving up the very best pizzas in town. On Saturday night I tried a few and all were simply bliss, perfection, and delicious!  I just doesnt and I dont believe it could be any better then The Parlor... The very best restaurant in town!!!

Pizzeria Delfina, Mozza, and The Parlor. All pretty amazing restaurants!!! 3 of Americas greatest spots for the tastiest pizzas I have ever had, and I live in the town of Pizzaria Bianco and Humble Pie. I have made thousands of pizzas so I feel qualified to say that The Pizzas I had tonight and other times at The Parlor are the very best!!! Not only are the pies amazing but the Creamy Cheesy Cauliflower, The Panzenalla Steak Salad and any of the Fresh house made Pastas are always spot on. Tonight I dined with my favorite out of town foodies, 2 of which have never been to The Parlor, and I must say that once again everything we ate, touched, drank or spoke to was perfect. I was informed Alice was on her first day of vacation and I must say she left the place in capable hands. The only draw back was half way home we had buyers remorse that we didn't order the Olive Oil Cake or Tiramisu. I hate to raise anyone's expectations this high but I always expect excellent and have always received it. This is still my favorite restaurant in the world.

If I only had one word I would have to say PROFESIONAL!!!!!  This place is great!!! super efficient and goes above and beyond!!!!  Super convenient to home, and my vet gave them big thumbs up so of course it was a no brainer.  DG's meds were well priced and I called around. They were about half the price of a Vet I am not using any longer.  when I got home I found a greenie Dog biscut in the bag, It was yummy! Nice touch.  If you came to yelp for advice, Take mine, USE THEM!!!!

I voted here and decided I need to return.  This place is massive! Big indoor space and the outdoor spaces looked very intriguing. There is some bike parking on the south east side pretty close to the entrance  Upon entering I was greeted by The Curator with a solid 5-10 minute conversation about the best way to see her museum. It was a lot to take in but great information, so listen up!  A few highlight were about The Phoenix Lights, It was a very cool exhibit hall. I also enjoyed the Arizona Hall of Honor and exterior spaces.  In general it's a sparsely visited museum that has great exhibits and most worthy of a stop and price of admission.  It was a great visit and took about 2 hours at my slow pace.

Just had my second stop there in two years.  This time I had a full pound bluecheese burger. It was huge and lonely cause I had no one to share a side with so I didnt get one. The burger was JUST OK! big for sure and I think my side of Blue Cheese dressing was large enough to swim in. Nice touch but over kill for sure.  I admit I have had a better burger, but not a bigger one and it was less then 10 bucks!!! The space is looking dated, and needs some sprucing up, but the center strip location cant be beat. I think I might drop in on my next trip to Vegas, cause the bacon waffels still haunt me... in a good way.

It use to be great, but what happened?!?  This unit has been rode hard and put away wet! It's the smallest of all I have been to and defiantly worn out around the edges.  Drink stations are important and this one was lackluster, as was the micro service line. It must have been about 5 feet shorter than any other I have seen and not filled to the brim. I had a burrito the other day and just thought, I guess they peaked already. My burrito was filling but not great.  I have had a hundred meals at many Chipotles and just realized that it wasn't the units fault, or even the solid concept that so many emulate, it was just time, time has taken it's toll.  Who's/What's next ?!?

This place was just ok from the start.  I am pretty sure the overwelming smoked flavor of the brisket was from liquid smoke, otherwise it was half way decent. As a side note I had to get up in the middle of the night and scrub my hands and face because of the overwelming bbq smell.  The sides were pretty good, both the slaw and the fries ranked pretty high. My meal was served with out any napkins and my hands were covered in BBQ sauce before I realized just what was happening.  My waitress was fine,but not fun or with any personal touch, and my overall impression was that the entire staff was dialing it in.  If I was paying for that meal I wouldnt have been happy, but with a comp it was a decent option to another buffet.  I bet this place could be, or was at one time alot of fun.   If you dont buy into the hype and or expect authentic BBQ, just have a big drink you will do fine here.

Had some sorry undercooked under flavored wings delivered to my house today. The wings were delivered with no ranch, celery or carrots. and just kinda warm. I had to finish cooking them in the microwave.  The 3rd party delivery company was fast, 17 minutes, click to door. Too fast I guess, but polite and friendly. Postmates seemed pretty cool at that moment.  One thing is for sure BWW will take no responsibility for the quality, or accuracy of an order if done through Postmates.  Hmmn who gets the blame BWW of Postmates? I say BWW.

I instantly got a great vibe at this hip urban theater. staff tonight was super friendly and helpfull. Nice selectin of beers on tap but anything eles the might of had to offfer was a mystery. I saw some candy and popcorn on the way in, otherwise they need a touch of help with merchandising. The theater was cool, it reminded me of the great small theaters in San Fransisco. The place was not as new and shiny as I expected it to be, but I liked the funky cool better then polished and contrived. The place was plenty clean and the seats comfy enough. The website has been added to favorites and thats a great start. I will be back!

Scottsdale Rd & Thomas Went in fully intending to join but the pricing and extra fees coupled with first and last month up front on top of activation fee etc. You get my point!!! The big problem was the 16 year old girl who knew nothing about the club or it's policies was no help at all!!! When she approached "the manager" for help, he ran into a back room never to be seen again. So it was just me and the little girl staring at each other for 10 minutes till I left  I really though finally a gym with no Bullsh*t high pressure sales or complicated contracts. I was so wrong!!! beware of this place big time!!!!!

This is my favorite urban park in the world!!!  This is a cant miss Old town Attraction!!!  It's a gorgeous well cared for park, with beautiful lawns and gardens really nice fountains and tons of public art.  The mall is host to many festivals throughout the year, and this upcoming Monday I will be attending a wedding for the third time in this park.  Surrounding the park are a few great places to refresh and have a bite, including the legendary AZ88 and Iron Chef Jose Garces's Distrito and OTT AKA Old Town Tavern (drinks only), Public spaces include Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale's Center for the Arts and one of the best public libraries I have ever been to. (tip* great air conditioning and restrooms)  It's not a big park, a stroll through at a leisure pace takes less then half an hour, but take your time, and some photos.

I like this place!!!  Stopped in for a happy hour beer and shopping respite, and was sooooo pleasantly surprised.  The place looks great, The service was  above average, and very friendly and welcoming, The beer was cold, discounted and was givin many great choices. food well it was bliss. I had the potato cakes from the half off happy hour menu. These crispy spice cakes might be amungst the best appitizersin town! They are certainly better then any appitizer at Tempe Marketplace.  word on the street is good too!!! I cant wait to get back!!!!

I have heard lots of good stuff about this place so my expectaions were set high.  The morning we went was beautiful so we sat on the patio. It's a nice patio with a nice view of the area, but nothing extra special about it. We really came to eat, and not realx but it was relaxing and service was pretty good too. The menu seemed small to me, not a lot of options, but what was striking was the prices. This place is Very expencive, even for Scottsdale! a basic 2 egg, bacon, potato, and toast breakfast, inwich was on the small side is 10.50 almost everything eles cost more! and It seemed any little change or modification incured an "up-charge" 1 dollar for jalepeno jelly... Really!!!! thats just the start. What was exceptional was the Buttermilk dill toast, by far the best toast I ever had! but when asked if they sell the bread to go I found out they do, but it's $12 a loaf. keep it. The corn bread was just as yummy but they make you pay for the jalepeno jelly, $1 for an ounce, YIKES! Dotties is "good" but for the prices, either the portions need to be improved, or stop nickle and diming for extras. For now I'm eating at other places. This corner has been lots of things, restaurants seem to come and go here, I wonder who or what will be next, as I dont think this place has staying power.

Start to finish Del Frisco was just ok.  Parking was a bit of a conundrum, maybe better investigation was needed before we left the house, but mid day Sunday we were confused and left the car behind in the lot without confidence.  We were meeting a group for brunch and not only did we arrive before anyone in our group but we were the first to arrive at the restaurant that day. The front doors were open but the hostess was real quick to say "we are not open yet" I felt shoed away and we sat outside for the next 10 minutes.  Reservations were made well in advance and we were the first table sat that day, yet the two tables pushed together for our group were miss matched, as if an after thought.  It was brunch in a beautiful space yet the restaurant experience was just boring. Take your order... bring your drinks.... drop your food... get your check, all executed "ok" except the last. When ok ends in failure its a big scuff on a restaurant that I imagine has higher standards. To sum up service it ranged from boring to bad. By the way it took more then 20 minutes to prepare checks. The server was visible and visibly so confused that it was painful to watch. Finally one person in our party just gave her a card and paid for everyone, thus eliminating everyone's discomfort.  As far as the food my dish was tasty I had one of the benedict's, and I enjoyed every last bite, however that was the only thing I tasted at brunch. I feel there should have been more like some bread, a pastry, fruit, or an amuse. Nope just like Denny's nothing special, no surprises.  Someone asked me to recommend a spot for brunch yesterday and I didn't recommend Del Frisco fresh off a meal a week ago, I think that says a lot about my experience.  Del Frisco's needs to stop taking orders and serving food and make dining in their beautiful place an event, Identify service missteps and fix them, and start brunch with a little something special from the kitchen.

Just got driven home by a polygamist! Oh boy did he have an opinion! I am ok with people that have different views and ideas, but this guy just seemed crazed. I was actually worried and got out of the cab 3 blocks from home. I just didn't feel safe!!! I don't think he was drinking or doing drugs, though the second more likely, but I bet he has more cats then wives at home.

It was Game Day ASU vs Washington so the entire area was busy.  So many new options have opened in this area, however I kept my vow to just follow along. Although rare, I wasn't the leader on this day. I was a little heart sunk when our group walked right past Postinos, and a touch relieved as we strolled by Dickies BBQ, and then there it was... The Mad Hatter, I had been there before and it was always empty. Today the place was very busy with a patio extension and extra security. As we made our way through the place we ended up at a  great table on the original patio, smack dab on the corner of College and Veterans Way. The table was perfect, and the company was stellar and that's as good as it got.  Our server was obviously not a regular staff member, he seemed like someone's buddy that just worked on game days. Initial beer orders taken and tiny paper game day menus dropped. The menu was small, with just a few items, a burger, chicken strips, French dip and chili cheese fries. I guess when your expected volume soars from regular days you have to do what it takes to keep the quality coming out of the kitchen. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. everything from the kitchen was barley passable to awful.   French dips were bland with no flavor at all and the au jus was served in 1 ounce Jello shot cups, certainly not dippable, and the fries with mine were Ice cold. The Chili Cheese Fries were even worse because they looked disgusting and tasted like curry and were smothered in gloppy flavorless cheese. My friend said she was going to eat her burger but it wasn't very good, and the chicken strips weren't finished by a big 17 year old boy.   All this served with no salt and pepper, no napkins or utensils and OLD broken, almost empty ketchup bottles.  I know this place is almost always slow, It really needs customers and I think instead of turning off 300 people on game days they should try and wow 300 people on game days. Location for us was great and it was a nice gathering of old friends, at least we had that.

Did I ask them to cook my burger perfectly... no, but they did!!!  As a matter of fact they never did ask me how I wanted my 10 ounce burger cooked, but when it came out and I had my first taste I knew it was love at first bight! I dont think I have ever had a better cooked or tastier burger in my life! The carmlized onions were bliss and the pretzle bun had just the right heft to hold up to this massive burger  The place was only 11 days old on our visit so when the Pig Wings didnt fly, that misfire was excused, but with a tad more work this intersting cut of pork could soar. The "wings" were just a tad dry and the sauce was one dimentional, but I like the concept.   Our server offered the wedge salad $5 and said it was good- she was flat out lying, it was amazing! By far the very best wedge I ever ate, made myself, or served any one of my customers. Our group of 3 were still talking about it 3 days later, and we are all foodies that work in the Biz.  One of the owners stopped by the table to chat, that was a nice touch and her crazy beautifull smile was a more then welcome addition to our lunch.  Is this the best restaurant in town... Heck No! it's far to cassual to compete with the very best, but its my new favorite place in Old Town. jv

What What?.?.?.... No jalapenos?!?!?!?   What kinda joint is this. well it's flavorless, at least thats my take. The Burrittos Blah! The Tacos Blah! The Nachos Blah! All eiether had NO flavor or The Flavor was off. Its a shame to fill a thin soggy tortilla with 80 cents worth of ingredients and wrap it in such a thin piece of foil that it splits and leaks out of the bag, and charge 8 bucks for it! especially when its as sad as these!!!   I tried it twice and have to pull the plug. My wallet will never again see the light of day in a place like this.  I will say the staff has always been friendly though.

On a recomendation for a restaurant in a neighborhood I didnt know very well, Angels Trumpet Ale House it was.  Super easy to find and just steps from the nights final destination FILMBAR. Prior to arrival it was Yelped and Googled and this beer centric gastro pub seemed to be the perfect spot to catch up with an old friend prior to a movie.  My beer recomendation was fine as I took my sugestion of the server that offered 3 THREE fruit beers, because I wanted someting lighter. The peach ale was tasty and I cant wait to get back and try some of the other 9000 beer selections, belly up to the bar, and wash those down with the Poutine or as known there as The Mess.  I have heard about this dish that is a late night staple in Canada. heck all  14,000 Canadians cant be wrong. The chefs must hang out in MY kitchen because they used the perfect amount of fragrant black pepper ( my favorite seasoning) near perfect gravy and plenty of deliciouce fried cheese curds on top of expertly cooked fresh skin on fries. This dish was a perfect 9... or 10 or somewere in between that.  I plan to get around that menu but we both ordered the same thing, a turkey sandwich by the numbers. Mine would have been stellar without any chipotle, but the rest of the fine ingredients overshadowed the one overplayed flavor. The turkey was fresh roasted, great avocado and the VERY BEST toasted bread I have had in years. The side of chips were a great option.  The space is really cool, great chairs and heft tables, if not a tad noisy (screeming baby) prices good and this yelper says its a must try when in the Rossevelt Row.

This was my second visit to Bacchanal! The first was 25 year ago, then it was amazing and mesmerizing. It was my first BIG VEGAS Dining experience. I remember that long walk back to that corner and those steps that are now gone, boy that was a fun night! I ate so well and drank wine, service was so good and kind, I felt special, and have always loved Caesars Palace since!  Today I had lunch at the new Bacchanal, I have had it on my short list for some time and although dinner wasn't in the cards this trip lunch today worked out just fine.  Lets start with me breaking the cardinal rule of no pasta, but I couldn't help myself because I had some BBQ in front of me. both were missteps. The BBQ sauce was off and the meat was too smoky. It was tender and generous, and the mac was grainy and overcooked but still an awesome effort from any buffet.   The salad bar had been devastated and almost all of the veggies gone and not replenished but I had some arugula, field greens and Maytag Bleu Cheese from the next station, and red wine vinegar, it was stellar.   Other stand out Items included Chinese BBQ pork, California Roll, although the F&B manager would be proud of the amount of rice used (lots). I enjoyed the Shrimp and crab but not the lobster corn chowder from the seafood station. The Deserts are very cool and all bases are covered. The Peanut butter and chocolate pop was my favorite, but the Oreo mousse was also delish!   I had 6 small plates including desert all were good or better, service was efficient and friendly, what more can you ask for. As far as value it was fine, I knew the price and never felt cheated.  Will I return, you bet, only for dinner! and we shall have wine and celebrate the abundance of food before us!!! I actually cant wait.

Love at first glance... This place has potential, lots of potential. Made a plan to stop in on a preview night. $1 martinis, & free appitizer, good call on my part.  The place was lively, but still room to get in and get somewhat promptly served. A profesionals observation was that all the bartenders were hot servers. management made bartenders, I thought this cause, they are all hot, they took the menus away each and everytime, even when you asked to keep it or have another, with each order... yep gone... snatched from my martini soaked fingers. Leave the menus with all that great food and an amazing list of specialty cocktails.... for the Love Of God dont take my menu!!!! The other tell was none of the "Hot bartenters" couldnt remember an order and they constantly asked twice or even 3 times to everyone in my area. Lorin was the exception, and she was super sweet, friendly, and wanted to make sure I got EXCELLENT Service. I did, thanks Lorin! The Food, well my Free appitizer arrived withen a few (2) minutes of ordering it. I know it wasnt at its best but it was still great, Tempura Shrimp with 3 sauces on the side, and free. My first martini arrived about the same time. Juicy wet and ICE COLD just the way I like em. Second Martini was a bit more dry and effen great!!! cucumber, mint, lime and more, another hit. Still hungry I orderd the Blue Louie Burger. This burger with bacon, blue cheese, spinach and wing sauce was FRIKKEN AMAZING a solid 10 and I cant wait to have another please. I really like what they did with the place and good riddence to that ol' Darcy place. Open with a great patio and center bar, they place has a nice vibe, super good looks, and its easy to dance to. er... I digress. I cant wait to return and that alone gets 5 stars, but a solid menu, great service, nice atmosphere, and great specials... you had me at specials, make this place a solid must try. GOOD LUCK and may the third time be the charm, Welcome to the Hood Louie!!!!

Everything I have tried has been amazing!  They have an awesome menu with lots of interesting, and perfectly crafted meals.  My favorite dish has to be the Brussel Spouts with a fried egg, but usually we just order a bunch of appetizers and build a charcuterie board to share.  Servers are always ready to make recommendations from start to finish including and excellent selection of craft beers and whisky.  If you are in the mood to have some great food and dine in a very casual dining room and patio make plans to try this place.

Great stop on the way to Chase Field, It's right on the Mill Ave light rail stop. Awesome chips and salsa  and Ice cold beers, Jeromy makes the best margaritas in town! It was mid-day Sunday and the place had a great crowd. Service was great from start to finish.

Pickles, Pickles Pickles ! It was only after my 3rd visit that I got  pickle chips on a sandwich and I have to say they were the best Pickle I have yet to try in al my nearly 5 decades here on earth!   The Sandwich I had yesterday was weird though tasty, I kinda thought they made a mistake and gave me tuna. It was THE TURKEY,The Turkey meat was in shreds and very wet, that with the pickles, peppers, mustard, mayo and vegies It was a conundrum.  I wanted the same sandwich I had a few days prior but I didn't recognize it on the menu, I now know it was THE ITALIAN. This sandwich is so fresh with great meats and fresh toppings it was a winner and I was both Happy and Sad I had to share it with a hungry coworker.  My first impression last week on my first visit, I had the CAPISTRAMI, It was highly recommended by the cashier and although I have never wanted to order a Ruben, I must say the sandwich was a solid 9 out of 10.  I love the location of this new Capriotties, It's a very welcome addition of fast casual restaurants that scatter the area I work in. Americas Taco Shop, Qudoba, Paradise Bakery are weak options and I almost would rather go hungry. That problem is solved with Capriotties now in the hood.  What needs work are the side options, as of now only chips, I hope they work on that!   What doesn't need work is the sandwiches and Ultra helpful, professional, and extra friendly staff.  Welcome to Old Town CAPRIOTTIES!!!!! Keep up The Great work!!!!!

This is the second time I have played when the Bingo hoper had an extra ball. This type of thing should NEVER happen!!!!. Management was upset because The players were upset. I say manage harder and work easier. This is not grandma's bingo, there is massive amounts of money at stake and errors shouldn't happen. Certainly not twice!!!!!

After about 2 dozen visits I think it's about time for a review.  Why 4 stars and not 5?!?! Because it is not the best Hamburger in town!!! Sure they are doing a lot of things right, probably everything right, but there is a lot of competition these days and a few blocks south and just to the east is a great place that is making The finest Hamburgers in the country. However that doesn't take away from all of the effort and expertise exuded at CBAC.  About those burgers I have tried a few and they are great, I really like to build my own so It's just so and that works out great for me. They make that nice and easy with the customer order forms for build your own burger and on the other side build your own mac and cheese. With the burgers comes great fries, or chips, and other options to upgrade your sides for a price. Meat and non meat options are also great for the burgers so choice and selection is awesome. My only "beef" with the burgers is with the cheese, it isn't melted to the patty, its always stuck to the top bun, always, so I imagine it's just how they do it, instead of a cooking problem.  The prices seem to be a little high, It's Scottsdale prices for sure, from $9.00 to $14.00 for burgers and mac and cheese option are about the same. Up grade your sides and have a few beers and per person check averages are a restaurateur's wet dream.  I like to sit at the bar where service has always been efficient if not great. The ladies behind the bar are attentive and are always ready to make that sale. Maybe I don't go enough or just because they are so busy, but nobody has ever remembered me and welcomed me back. That's a little surprising since I live in Old Town area and manage a club around the corner, and often have my pre-shift meal here. I am going to just chalk that up to the volume they are doing, this place is always busy.  Big TV's, visible management, attentive service, decent Happy hour, and a pretty good meal, in a great location works for me. Looking forward to seeing what's next from this team!

This is the BEST new restaurant addition to Scottsdale since ReHab Burger Therapy!  I love this place, the compound is huge and very welcoming, I love the chunky wood tables, but not as crazy about the "fixed" in place barstools. You can tell the kitchen is serious with just a glance, but after a few bites it's amazingly obvious that this place is for real.  I had the Greek salad with chicken and The Royal Pasty, both were firkin AMAZING, there is only one other salad in Scottsdale that even gets close to the quality and flavor of this one, and that's The Chopped Salad at Humble Pie.  The Royal might have been the best thing I have eaten all year, seriously I have craved it every day since!!!! The expert flaky crust and incredible ingredients within are pure perfection!  Service was just great, efficient and friendly, our server was well trained and had a personality to back that up!  The location is awesome, though I expect parking might be a challenge if the place is packed and it often is packed. It sits smack dab on Goldwater near Main St and the views and people watching are lots of fun.  I have heard about The Tempe location for years and I cant believe my first try was last week at there newest but not last location!  Cornish Pasty Team, YOU GUYS ROCK!!!! GREAT JOB, an THANKS for opening in my hood!!!!

Joes is The Real Deal.  I love Italian ice, it is my go to snack when I can find it. The other day I found Joes on the way out to dinner.  It was my Birthday so I was real quick to suggest skipping dessert at dinner so we could go to Joes after. That was a great choice and a very pleasant Birthday surprise.  Joes is a real neat place with tons of cool memorabilia and interesting décor. The menu boards are easy to read on lcd screens, and the place was spotless, I truly mean that. The floors immaculate, the counters and tables perfect, not one speck of dust anywhere and yes even the tons of chrome was without spots!  Service was quick and friendly and even Joe himself was on hand to wish me a happy Birthday and exchange some friendly banter.  What was most remarkable were the Ices, everything I tasted was fantastic, but the mix of bing cherry Ice and soft serve was AMAZING!!!  I can not wait to return!!! trust this YELPER and stop in, you cant miss the place!

Every thing you have heard about this place is true!!!  Yep, there's a Long Line every day! You bet it's kinda outa the way.  Of course it's not a shinny corporate box restaurant. Forget about dinner here it's usually sold out and closed by 3pm I recommend patients in the parking lot. I would be lying if I didn't admit its some of the finest que in the country!  If you can, wait in line for it, it's worth it! Bring a friend or have your lunch meeting in line. Try a few things, I loved the turkey, and sausages, the brisket was mighty fine as well, but the house made Pastrami is like no other. All of the sides are great, and soda is served in a can. It's not cheap, but worth every penny!

Have you ever had to make a choice to pick a Vet or a "new" Vet?  This week I did, based on on-line reviews, location, and an on the phone consultation I chose Hayden Road Animal Hospital.  The place is immaculately clean, inside and out. I appreciated the separate cat and dog entrances. Reception was solid and knew who we were as we entered for the first time.  I seriously though the Vet Tec was our Vet, she was that good, kind smart, and listened.  I must say once me and DG met Ryan our vet we were very impressed with him. He makes going to see The Doctor easy.   They want my business and they shall have it. I am very impressed by our first visit

Wow. I am still upset I was too mad to stay for that mac and cheese burger. I walked in at 3:01 & walked out at 3:21 that was 20 minutes to not get a beer. I sat at the bar that was fairly empty, more open seats then occupied. I thought I was on my way to flavor town. What went wrong was simple service across the bar. I waited and waited and waited. I don't mind  waiting especially when tenders are busy but what I saw was oblivion. Even after I ordered, my bartender served walk ups two waters and then had a big swig of oj while chatting up coworkers. 10 minute's to take an order can happen but 10 minutes to not yet fill it is just plain ineptness especially when the rail is at 50%. And four people were behind the bar. I get it, service  in Vegas sucks, but I expected more here.

Service is pretty darn good, our bartender remembered our names throughout the afternoon and we never went without!  The Pizza here is Top Notch, Its not those fancy artisan pies that almost everyone is doing now, just a great pizza with great fresh toppings and OUTSTANDING crust!  The Place was full of gen Xers soaking in the nostalgia, yet none of the youngins working here seemed to know about the Barns history, Romance and Lore.  The place is squeaky clean and that's the part I don't remember!  Welcome back minder Binders! You did good and It was worth the wait!!!

This place will be as good as your server.  The chain is growing and they run on margins and SERVICE, so the on intangible on my first visit was great. My Bartender wrote her name on a card and introduced herself though I cant remember her name, service was spot on, kind and friendly. We chatted a bit and she took my cues that my phone and Sport Center was more important, none the less way better then most bartenders in this town. Way better. I had the Happy hour Pepperoni pizza and a pint of San Tan Devils Ale, a big glass a water came unsolicited with a big welcome smile.  All's good at the valleys newest TL and in a few months I will wait for a table or barstool without thinking why, cause I know why.  Why am I telling you this?!?! good luck TL FS

More reasons to venture downtown, everyone in my group tonight lives adjacent to Mill Ave or Old town yet our dining plans drew us to Metro Phx.  Word is spreading about this ambitious Euro-Trend Hot Spot. This place is Keen, Super Sleek, and Tasty as Heck. Service tonight was Spot-On and very informative (everyone had a ton of questions) those questions and deft service handled well by our charming waiter Javi.  I was impressed by the set of restrooms that weren't labeled, about time, and I hope more places follow suit.  Lots of small plates (tapas style) hit our table and everything was remarkable. The Pirogues where delish, Kilbasa had just the right snap and spice, and the Cabbage Rolls beat expectations although the Tomato *Cream sauce was not expected yet still tasty.  Beer selection and Cocktails where Stellar, and well thought out, I cringed when my group was asking about margaritas but they were quickly steered towards some amazing well crafted drinks.

Work in progress!!!  I found this place a few days after it opened, and even though a lot of work has gone into this place over the last 8 or 9 months, there are still things to be finished.   Notably is the draft beer system, its not yet up to full speed, but it has promise, and these guys are pretty serious about there suds so there is plenty to look fwd to.  We didn't stop in out of hunger, it was more curiosity and some buzz on the streets, but The Pizza I did try was fantastic. I had the Blanco with burata and spinach. The simplicity of this pie proves, less is more. If I closed my eyes it would be hard to convince me that this pizza didn't come from Mozza, Delfina or The Parlor! it was that great!  Service was exceptional, friendly and attentive, It felt like somewhere I would want to return soon, and I will.  Once this place catches on it looks like its going to be great, really great and that is mostly based on taste alone! credit for heart and potential, and It's in my hood so that's great too!

I have been looking for a new road bike so I have been in and out of bike shops for weeks. My usual haunt Tempe Bicycle shuttered in December, so the hunt was on.  I have been riding casually for 30 years and have purchased many bikes from several of TB's various locations. When they closed I felt a void in options. That is until I walked into Sonoran. It just so happens that Sonoran is in the small space just to the south of the last Tempe Bike in The Cornerstone..  This place immediately put me at ease, and they helped me find the perfect Road Bike. I was already a Giant fan, but the time the very informed and patient Bike tech Drew took with me on this selection is unparalleled  compared to the service and attention I got from about a half dozen other shops around town.  This place has an amazing selection and an excellent well equipped service department, but most of all it's the amazing well trained techs that are running the place that makes it the best bike shop around.

I should have read some of these YELP Reviews before I stopped in.  It was buzz on the street about the awesome donuts that brought me in here, What I didn't hear about was the concept itself, It's basically Build your own custom made to order donuts.  I had 5 minutes, and that's all I needed. Luckily it wasn't crowded and the Uber Perky Cashier was happy to guide me through my first visit.  I had the apple pie donut and it really was marvelous just the right crunch and heft, and the apple, cinnamon topping was delicious.  My $2 donut was served in a lovely 40 cent logo box that could hold 2 or 3 donuts, I would try and opt out of the box for just one donut next time. No time for coffee but if I had to bet I would say they probably brew a great pot, frequently.

Out with the old and in with the new! Stopped in today with my brother to try some of the grub I have been hearing about for the past few weeks. It really was all that and more!!! I generally don't trust most restaurants with Cole Slaw, but I have always trusted George and his kitchen and I have to say The Slaw is OUTSTANDING!!! what was even more perfect was the Brisket sliced just the way I like it and the star of it all was The smoked Turkey Breast. My bro tried the mac and cheese and said it was as good as the Original spot. No fried Raviolis or late night drinking here, but I actually like this spot better then the old digs on Scottsdale rd.  Service couldn't have been any better from the nicest lady, and it was great to cross paths and palms again with George.  Stop in cause these guys have cued up some mighty fine BBQ.

"Hi welcome to Portillos!" Try the salt its great! "we can even give you a beef sandwich or fries to go with that yummy salt" while we prepare your tasty salt bombs you can wait ............................over............there, yes by all those other people, listen careful for your number, and please don't sit till we give you your food, no matter how long that's going to take".   I couldn't wait for Portillos to open and after lunch today I feel I was duped!!! It wasn't the plentiful and polite staff, or the Disney esque big top meets roadhouse interior, it wasn't what seemed like reasonable prices, or even the hoards of crowds most restaurants only dream of.  Alas it all came down to element number 1, The food. I had a hot dog with everything. This shy dog wasn't too shy with the celery salt, it completely over powered all other flavors. As for the texture of that barker it was so soggy the bun seemed to drip off, and the peppers so tough I had to take them out of my mouth. The pickle on it was far bigger then the frank that just seems like reckless pickling!  My beef sandwich was amongst the worst I have ever had, The meat was dry and mealy, The bread was lame, crunchy on the outside and almost as wet as the dripping hot dog paste bun on the inside. What struck me hardest was the massive dose of SALT!!!! Yikes I even like salt. I couldn't get back in line and wait twenty minutes to try over, so my lunch today hit the trash can!!!!  I may have caught them on a bad day, it was certainly a busy one, but my first try will be my only try. There are better options around town and with less circus!!!

I like this spot!  The food is great, everything I have tried showed care and great effort.  The beer brewed here is amazing and there is a great selection.  It is not the cheapest spot in town, but prices are fare.  I'm not a regular, and there are plenty, but service is always great, no matter who you know.  It's a beautiful compound and well maintained.  It's defiantly worth the stop, grab a few pints or goblets and a bite, all are yummy!

Ok Ok I finally made it back to Pedal Hause!  On my last review  I exclaimed it Haus to get better... It did  It was happy hour just prior to a movie and then just after, so that says a lot. On my original visit I never looked back. On my last visit I made a bee-line to get back!  As reviewed the place is massive and gleaming, it's a beautifully designed place from front door to back patio and in-between.  After tasting the Hause Brews I'm hooked, Its a wonderful selection from top to bottom. Only one other brewery has it covered this well. ( I wont say who, but it's not 4pks) I especially like the Belgian Dubble, It's Marvelous it really is!!!  Service was great but not personal, she served us and left us alone. Our tender did ask about our day and that's important from a happy hour bartender.   No food was ordered but after perusing the menu I will be back. I did notice the burgers started at $13.00 ea so that set the tone, but the mussels look good, and I almost always get "the beer munchies"  The paper menus/ lists are still a mess, but when everything else goes great it's easy to overlook.  I think they found there stride, and $3  excellent Haus Brews at happy hour are my best reason to return!!!   *follow up visit and review as promised.

We actually did a U turn after we drove past this relatively new Urban Nursery.  From the curb you get a sense this isn't an old school dusty dry average place. As you enter this Urban oasis you can see a strong pride of ownership, This place is organized and tidy! lots of things to look at in every corner.   My garden is pretty established right now so I didn't by any plants, but I plan to go back. They do have a great selection of heirloom seeds and I did grab a few packs that I already got started, to be ready for spring.   These guys share their macaws that live in the center of the pergola, and there are many cool group boxes and awesome terrariums to look at.  One of the owners, Ryan, took a little time to talk about gardening, plants and soil , and he knows his stuff, I left feeling more informed and enlightened. I sure was impressed with his Pro-Style.  Wondering if you should stop? I say YES YES YES!!! Fair Prices, Knowledgeable Owners, and a Great selection, in a Very Cool Space.

Take out tonight was tasty, portions were great, take out container totally sucked. Cheap hinged Styrofoam box leaked and not nice to eat from. Bar is detached from dining room but service was tall and great. I will dine in next time for sure.

By now I am sure Dan Harkins thinks he has heard it all, maybe he has, because by now he may have stopped listening.  In most cases a big brand new state of the art movie theater would be amazing to have in your neighborhood especially for a movie goer like me, however when that theater replaces your 2 favorite theaters and doubles the price of a matinée ticket, it's just not good.  It's true, the New Camleview is pretty, and I might be showing my age, but the new digs just cant replace FS7 and the original Camleview, and its not just the price. Parking is not as good as well as having the food court to meet up in. When I would go to the original Camleview it seemed like an event. On my first and last visit to The New FS Camleview I just shook my head and my friends agreed.  I watch almost all of my movies during daytime hours and have always appreciated the matinée prices but alas that's no longer the option in my neighborhood. I also noticed the great art house films have been replaced with the blockbuster de jour on half of the screens.   I imagine Harkens didn't do this blindly, they did the research and checked the demographics, over and over, but they some how missed me, the regular movie goer,that would see 6 or 7 movies a month that's about $84 for the new place a month plus concessions and invited friends that wont be going back to this theater any time soon.

Howard doesn't like when "friends" post reviews, but heck I was there last night and last time I checked I was an Elite Yelper, I also don't work for Stand up Scottsdale...anymore!  I was excited to see the new place, and I tend to be hyper critical, and I have a great eye for a well run comedy club, I have been in many, some well run and some not, so here goes.  My first impression of The Days Hotel complex was Stellar! Squeaky clean, and an amazing combo of Rock and Roll and Southwestern décor. The staff was friendly, kind, and helpful.  It was once I hit the doors of the new SUS that I knew something special was about to happen. Personal greetings from Howard and Lisa for all, not just me. They want you there, they want to entertain you.  What happened was a great line-up of very funny comedians was set and achieved entertaining a full house. The fact that Howard is booking such amazing talent in what is obviously a small room (120?seats) in such an intimate setting makes this place a cant miss.   Looking at the calendar there is no letting up, these are the same comedians being booked at the really big clubs in town and across the country. Take advantage of that because sometimes in small rooms magic happens as I think it did with Deitrich Shelton, Paul Johnson Howard and Lynne Koplitz last night. It was one of my very favorite shows ever.  Service was great and Food and beverage options are as good as the 5th Ave location at its best. Come hungry and early because The food looks amazing as did the margaritas.  I cant wait to go back!

Another addition to this NEW and CROWDED Pizza Segment, that is build your own Quick fired Pizza- ala Chipotle style . What's best about this concept is you get the pizza just the way you want it without paying $1.10 for each different topping.  You have probably been to one of these, 1000 degrees, My Pie, Mod, Fired Pie and/or several others that are growing locally and Nationally. Thus enter BLAZE, the newest addition to the Valley.  The Pizza and Hospitality I received today was great. It's a super nice, friendly and competent staff, and some great fresh toppings with an excellent variety.  The place was packed to the rafters and I would estimate they were cranking out about 4 pizzas a minute. They cook quick, 180 seconds, I was gleefully told.  I did notice the slicer trimming the edge of a slightly over cooked pizza. Mine however was baked just right.  What surprised me was the excellent slightly smoky flavor, it was so good. I wasn't expecting that from a gas flamed oven. Every topping cooked well and the cheese was great quality. The cheeses were excellent and delicious!!! Don't change a thing!!!  The Unit was fresh and open with wood tables and concrete floors. The table I chose wasn't cleaned yet, but it was clear, not really a problem since I chose it and there was a dining room attendant working hard.  Beverage station was above average and I tasted most of the fresca's, lemonades, and natural sodas in the 180 plus seconds it took to bake my pizza. The beverages might be one of the things that elevates Blaze above the others. I settled on The Blood Orange lemonade that was just a tad to sweet by the time I got to the bottom of the cup. Mint lime fresca was refreshing but I didn't want to commit to a full cup.  I Really like Blaze. How can you knock a really good pizza and drink for 10 bucks. I'm a pizza snob/Pizziolo. There are so many great pizza places out there, but I for sure will be back here! Good Luck and keep up the good work.  Managers; Solid opening and you have a great crew! Congratulations... get some sleep
