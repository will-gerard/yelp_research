Good food, tiny portions, pricey for the amount you get.

I'm not a beer drinker, so I cant rave about how delicious the beer is... but I will say that my boyfriend loved it!  He got the (very reasonably priced!) sampler tray, so was able to taste a little bit of everything and was impressed.  My review is based off of the food, which was fantastic!  I never thought I would enjoy a plate of nachos as much as I enjoyed a plate of these nachos!  We ordered a few other apps as well, and they were all absolutely delish.    Very impressed with the food, service was good, prices were great... 5 stars from me!

A few friends and I went last Saturday, on their opening night, to catch a few college football games.  Huge let down.  First, the service was horrible.  The four of us sat down and waited for 15 minutes before going to order from the bar.  Even upon returning to our seats and finishing up our drinks, still couldn't get a waitress.  (I should mention that although it was their opening night, the place was not busy and there was no excuse to not get service at all...)  Thumbs down.  Second, and most importantly!, Babe's is a sports bar... or so I thought.  Despite the baseball and football paraphernalia all over the place, the tvs were playing a music video channel (think: Sandbar) and even after asking the bartender (three times) to change a few of the 1,000 tvs in the place to a certain football game, he refused... he said there is 'nothing he can do.'  Huh.  Thumbs WAY down.  Overall, not a great location, awful service and not the place to go if you want a sports bar rather than a mini-club/lounge.    Will not go back...everrrr.
