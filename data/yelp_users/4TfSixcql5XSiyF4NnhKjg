I came here for a nice girls dinner the weekend after ringing in 2016. The ambiance is really nice would be great for a date night. They bring bread with oil- great bread, the oil is good - not the best-best, but very good.  I ordered the Cioppino, which although delicious, was not typical of what I'm used to.  It was served thick, over pasta. Usually I'm used to it being a full soup.  My friends got the penne vodka, and the other ordered a pasta/seafood dish.  For Arizona - the seafood and fish options are on-point. Mine was very very good, thick sauce, full of flavor. Not the traditional dish I expected, but absolutely a pleasant surprise!  The portions are very generous. I enjoyed my leftovers for lunch AND dinner the next day (granted I did fill up on the bread).  Wine pours are very generous. House chianti was very tasty and complimented my meal perfectly. The wine list itself is obvious to be matched to the menu. I'd love to try the lobster bisque there - usually when its on the menu of a good restaurant, it is very good.  I'll definitely be back, even though it is on the other side of town.  It was a great meal. I'll be honest, I was not expecting much.  But to find good italian food, with good service and great meals in Awhatukee, that surprise is very much welcome!

I grew up on Long Island, mecca of the Jewish delis. Goldmans can keep up with the best.  Most times like tonight I'm here for the delicious homemade soup, but I've tried plenty of their lunch options also.  The chicken noodle soup I'm hoping can be part of my cure for what seems like a pretty bad cold coming on - I'll keep you posted. The chicken salad and tuna salad platters are fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend them. The nova lox - my personal favorite -- is so good.  I've taken this home plenty of times and munched on it through the day.   The rugulas are the real deal.  I always get the double-chocolate, it is exactly how it is suppossed to taste - buttery, flaky but thick, not to sweet, and full of flavor.  If you've never had one, think of a croissant but smaller in size, and thicker in dough texture.  They are not a typical cookie.   Goldmans is great --- even better --- they're open til 8pm!!! How exciting you can drop by for dinner too!!!  Try Goldmans out. Prices are a bit higher than a typical sandwich shop, but so is the quality.  Worth a few extra dollars and a few extra minutes, trust me.

I was craving lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel, and so it was an easy decision to head here. The bagels are fab, the lox is fresh, and simply I know it would be exactly what I wanted.  In that respect, perfect to fill the void. Upon first entering, it's a little confusing. You first notice the take-out area, which is just all around a little sloppy and ill-organized. Then you notice the hostess, and she is quick to seat you. The dining room is larger than expected, it extends all the way through to a back room. The menu is extensive, and everything sounds delish.   I'm disappointed with the ambiance. Considering the high quality of the food and menu selections, I'd feel more comfortable if the place was more similar to like a Paradise Bakery instead of an IHOP... I also think a little breakfast bar would be perfect here. It was weird getting full waiter service for an easy little bagel sandwich.   They do have a full bar, so I naturally ordered a mimosa to celebrate a day off work ;). (Thank you MLK!) It was good. Not the best, not the worst.   I ordered a large mimosa, a bagel with lox and cream cheese, and a side of avocado. I considered my $18 tab a bit steep.   Will I return? Yes, but probably just for take-out. And only because I every once in awhile crave a good bagel with lox and cream cheese, and this place hits the spot. Unfortunately, the "cons" --namely the IHOP atmosphere and steep price tag -- are not enough for me to justify sitting down and exploring the menu more extensively.

I'm definitely one of those people who hates grocery shopping. Ugh.. What a chore. However... This Fry's makes the experience much less painful, even (gasp!) enjoyable at times!  First, it is very very clean. Upon entering you first approach produce which is adjacent to a salad bar, Olive bar, soup bar, fresh pizza to-go, and a wine bar! (They serve beer also). On the days I haven't prepared I'll enjoy a glass of wine while I write out my list. The selection is always changing and the bartender is very knowledgeable. Behind that is where the alcohol aisles are, including a nice prestigious little room of the fancier wines. I'm not that fancy so I haven't explored it but it looks to carry the boutique wines for the more experienced winos.   The whole store has so much to offer - good selection of organic, kosher, Mediterranean, Hispanic, fine cheese, real Italian pasta... I feel confident it could compete well with the boutique delis on the area for some of the specialities (maybe not Andreoli deli, but def Chompies).  The pharmacy area has replaced my need to stop by Walgreens with the exception of my face wash. The prices on soap, lotion, shave gel, etc are very competitive with Walgreens or Target.  The guys at check out snd self check out get things done quickly. Oh, and stop by the in-store Cornerstone Creamery on your way out for some ice cream. It always smells delish!! This is definitely my fave grocery store in the entire Scottsdale area.

I'm so happy I live so close to this place. These bagels remind me of growing up on Long Island. You won't be disappointed. And a Yelp Offer also -- it's like striking gold!!

Woohoo!! This place really is as good as it gets. I started going a few years ago and now pretty much go for routine touch ups a few times a year. The prices are the best in the valley, and it drops to 50% after 6 sessions.  To be clear -- laser hair is not really 100% permanent removal. If you are investing in these services know that you'll still want to go about twice a year for maintenence, sometimes more frequent if you are picky.    I try my best to schedule with Heather -- she is honest, quick, professional, and offers advice for where it will and will not work.  Every time I've left a voicemail i've recieved a prompt message back.    I have lasered most everything except full legs, because its just so darn expensive. The pain is worth it, friends! The cost is worth it, and this place delivers results! I am so happy I found this place a few years back, and I wouldnt trade it for the world.

For quick service and always satisfying my taste for lazy comfort food, this place rocks. Do not come here for great service or ambiance, its a take-out place more than anything else.  I've tried several of their dishes but always resort back to my classic/no-frills order: two chicken tacos. These fill me up and have a respectable amount of chicken in them. The fried taco shells and shredded cheese is what I'm really craving but since the chicken actually provides nutrition it's a nice balance.  I don't care for the albonginas soup - too oily. They do a very good job of keeping the salads healthy as long as you don't eat the shell it's a good healthy meal. The nachos are. .... nachos. Order those for your drunk friends. Back to my point - in my experience stick with the tacos if that's what you're in the mood for. I'll choose these tacos over Best Little Taco shop or Blind Pig any day. ¡Olé!

So last night, Wednesday, my typical routine involves dragging my a$$ to a gym class. My friend calls me as I'm driving home from work and suggests the opposite of a workout -- Happy Hour. The week I've been having... there was just one answer-- YESSSSSSS!!!!   I suggested Village Tavern, having seen good reviews and remember eating there a year ago, wanting to revisit.  The experience last year wasn't really memorable -- it was the type of situation where I was hungry and the place is a mile from my house, so it more just fit the bill.  Last night however was a different story.  We go to the bar section, it is packed but still has a table or two available inside. We sit down, and are greeted by the waitress. We start with the happy hour $5 Grey Goose cocktails -- they are Strong. Just what the doctor ordered. We split the prime rib sliders, and brie plate. Each are around $8. Both are delish!!!! The prime rib sliders are so good, come with au jus and have a ton of melted cheese on them. The brie platter is very good as well. Dried cranberries, apricots, and almonds are plenty on the plate, as well as great italian bread and our own little brie wheel. For girls skipping gym class, this is what its all about -- happy indulgences.  We were debating a third cocktail before happy hour ended, when the waitress informed us that Wednesdays are half off all wine glasses -- ALL NIGHT!!! WOOHOO!!!  So we switched to a glass of wine each and nibbled on some toast triangles and the worries from earlier in the week just turned into good laughs with a good friend.  We also agreed next Wednesday, we WOULD go to gym class -- but come back to Village Tavern afterwards for a little wine indulgence.  ;)  The scene should be mentioned -- almost exclusively Gainey Ranch retirees. Looks like they get all the good seats by 5pm.  Its a scene where you can pay attention to your friends and your food because there just isnt much eye candy to distract you....unless you're over 50. The inside decor is upscale tavern-y, very warm and inviting.

I love Olive and Ivy. It is a tried and true staple, always the first place I bring an out of town visitor.    The ambience inside is warm and charming, open and friendly, and classy.  I loove thier lighting it is just so inviting.  Tables are spaced nicely, the bar has great seating and not too packed in that area either.  You can order a meal at the bar without feeling like you're knocking elbows with the person next to you.  The outside of Olive and Ivy is my favorite though.  The social hour seating fills up QUICK - get there early.  There are comfy big chairs and couches right outside the waterfront.  It is my favorite sitting spot in all of scottsdale to eat drink and dine.  For food -- I've come here plenty, and here's my two cents. Skip the apps, share a salad with a friend, and enjoy an entree. I keep coming back to the veal ravioli, it is just heavenly and perfect.  There is arugula on top with a light cream sauce which isn't too heavy at all. I have to force myself to explore the menu because this dish is just so good.  Last time I was here I was trying to stick to my diet, I ordered the salmon and subbed spinach instead of thier regular side.  The dish was perfect, salmon was grilled to perfection, a real fresh piece of fish. It was generous too (more generous portion than the ravioli) - and I actually ended up taking some home. My mom ordered the Cioippino, which was flavorful, a generous portion, and very good also.  I also love their scallop entree.  I don't eat a ton of red meat, but I went with a friend one time who ordered the steak and pretty much devoured it.    As for drinks -- thier sangria is amaze! Stick with the red one.  Honestly I'm writing this right now, a warm February day in Arizona, and want to leave work to sit outside and eat my lunch in pure bliss at Olive and Ivy. I have a day off later this week and will make sure I stop by.  I simply cannot get enough of this place.

This is a great park to bring my feisty little Eleanor where she can roam and play and love life. The park is so clean and I feel like all the people who go there try to keep within the rules. I've been there several times and haven't witnessed anyone being rude or otherwise any animal aggression issues.  The dogs, the people, and the park itself is a great add to all the other things that keep Scottsdale an area to be desired.

I come here for lunch every now and again I always order a slice or two and a soda. I absolutely love thier specialty slices, they have the best white pizza I've had in a long time! The slices are pretty generous and one alone can fill me up and happily satisfy my pizza craving :)  The pizza dough could be a tad bit thinner crispy crust, but that's just my preference. The pizza slices are amazing. I'm glad this is a little far from where I work otherwise I'd be here all the time  I'm so happy I found this place. There are not many good food choices near my office, so NYPD is an awesome find!

As far as sushi in Scottsdale goes, this place is Top Notch. I've been here several times, and the price tag is well worth the quality and service that is delivered.   Most times I've ordered sashimi, a mix of yellowtail, salmon, tuna, and octopus.  OMG I literally can drool just thinking about it.  I swear the fish and preparation is almost like candy.  I've never ordered anything other than the seafood options. Literally, this is the best and freshest you can expect, you won't even know you're in arizona ;)   Cocktails are on point.  Whether a simple martini or one of thier signature drinks, you'll be in good hands with the care and craft that the bartenders at Roka Akor take in preparing your drink.    Room for improvement -- I wish wish wish wish there was outdoor seating for this place.  For beautiful scottsdale, it is sad to go from the sunshine outside into the darkness of its happy hour.  Once you walk inside, it immediately feels like night-time.   I also think their happy hour menu is misleading. Don't fall for it, the prices look good but only because the portions are miniscule. If you are going to Roka Akor, expect to drop some change, and don't try to navigate through a less expensive happy hour menu, as you'll only be ordering more in quantity and spending the same amount.  Order what you want to eat and you'll be much more satisfied regardless of what your tab ends up being.    Enjoy!!!

I'm updating my review to 4 stars, as this place has consistently delivered with the delicious menu items.  I've found a diet salvation in the form of gyro and chicken spring rolls, they are absolutely easy, filling, fresh, and cheap! I got them for lunch AND dinner yesterday, and Tracy, one of the owners, was sweet enough to remember me, and my name.  She is always there and so smiley and happy, she is a real treat to see when you are starving and know you'll be satisfied soon enough.  The hummus is my favorite other than Greek Wraps in Peoria.  I try to order hummus at almost every resturaunt, sort of like a competition I keep for the places I frequent.  Lucky for me Shish Kabobs and Gyros is right around the corner from me, and thier hummus is in my top picks.   Update to four stars, but still holding out on five mostly becuase it still seems like a takeout place.  I'm sure with increased business the decor will improve, as these ladies seem to give thier business 100%.  I'm excited to have this spot so close to my house.

This place is best for brunch when you want to keep last nights drinks flowing.  I have been here several times for that reason, and other times just for a healthy lunch.  The hangover breakfast is much more fun and they have great options to choose from  Breakfast nachos are by far the best to enjoy with a bloody mary.  They are everything bad for you that you shouldnt start your day with.  If you want less guilt, share them with a friend. But dont share with the whole table, the plate will easily disappear and you'll regret your generosity.  Ginger snap granola is so delish!! So tasty and flavorful! This isn't "healthy" -- so don't tell yourself it is.  If you want healthy, they have some egg white option omlettes that are pretty good, filling, and generous portions.  I only got one once because they are nothing too special compared to the rest of the fun menu.    Its fun to sit outside and watch the people walking by on Scottsdale road.  I've sat inside twice but outside is much more fun.  Their patio is dog friendly.    The service on weekend is slow --- be prepared to wait. They make the wait less painful with a coffee and water stand and nice chairs to sit on.  It is a common hangover breakfast spot, so the lines are full of some haggard looking zombies on saturday and sundays. However, its also a great place to meet with a group of people and enjoy a meal.  I've eaten dinner there twice. The menu for dinner is not my fave.  They do have great apps to share with friends, but to be honest, there are plenty of other places in the area at same price point that does a better dinner.  Stick with Daily Dose for breakfast or lunch, and you will have a happy full belly :) ...followed shortly by a nap.

I love this studio!!  I've been attending regularly for a little over a year and a half now, and I still feel the burn and I still love it! All the instructors are great. The schedule offers plenty for me to not skip too often, except the Sunday class sometimes gets a little too crowded. Save your spot by checking in online :-) It is not quite a class for guys. I've seen plenty of men attend barre, but never see them stick around as regulars. Not because it is a girly class-- it is not easy!!!-- but likely because the focus is on a long and lean look, more an image desired by women. All the girls who teach and attend are very fun and approachable.  The classes all have the same schedule-- first warmup, then arms, thighs, stretch, then tush and of course wrap up with a serious dose of ab work and a final stretch. Each teacher though puts her own spin to the class so it is never the same routine twice. It is amazing how quick the hour goes by. Use your Yelp check in and try your free class!! :-)

There are two locations --- the first (Tottie's 1) on Thomas/Hayden next to CVS in the Fresh and Easy plaza, and the second (Tottie's 2) is on Scottsdale/Hayden next to Trader Joe's and behind Fuego de Chao. I've been a regular at Totties for almost a year now. I've been to both locations but live closer to the Scottsdale Rd location so that's my usual spot. Tottie is there everyday to make sure her business runs smoothly, and she is not just hiding in a back office.  At any point in the evening you can find her behind the bar, managing take-out, or helping the kitchen if they need it.  She is a real treat!! Her professionalism is obvious, and is complimented by her spunk and pizzazz.  Tottie is always thinking of ways to improve her offerings and menu. The Scottsdale Rd. location just added a sushi bar, and matches the quality of the sushi at Totties 1.  The happy hour prices are a great deal. I always order Peace On Earth, a vodka martini that does just the trick to help me wind down. You can also get great deals on food and apps, and happy hour runs 4-7pm everyday (even weekends!).  I love Tottie's for two main reasons -- the atmosphere and the healthy options. There are plenty of go-to Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese food options on the menu if you're having a craving, but I usually stick with the spring rolls as my main meal. Basically its salad wrapped around beef, shrimp, pork, or chicken, and then held together with rice paper. They are so good and filling its like being able to eat a salad with your hands! Many of the entrees are large enough so that I'm still full even though I'll usually skip rice.   I could go on and on about my experiences here, but it really is five stars. I love the food, atmosphere, and owner. I've noticed many patrons are repeat customers as well.

I've been coming to European wax for about four years now for my eyebrows. The locations I've frequented are the one in Chandler/Awhatukee by AJs on Ray and the past year or so the one in Scottsdale on Scottsdale/McDonald in Hilton Village . They are professional, prompt, convenient and know their business. I always buy a package because it just makes sense money-wise and they usually have deals where you'll get a bonus appointment for buying it that way. Pre-booking appontments builds dollar credits you can use toward your next purchase which I always do. Today I noticed a sign about an unlimited year program and the girl took the time to see whether it would be worth it for me and we agreed it really wasn't. Instead of just going for a quick sale I was impressed at her research for me. I also found out that I spend about $170 annually on eyebrow shaping which is less than I really thought. (Even if it were more I'd still get it done bc I have no ability to make mine look even!) While I've never had a bad experience I prefer Monica and usually book with her. If schedules collide I feel confident with whoever else I might get.  If you're lucky you'll have Jasmine check you in. She's the manager of a few locations so its a rare treat to see her but she is just the sweetest and most professional girl ever! Every time I see her I am a little happier with my overall experience. There is nothing I would change about the way European Wax runs its business, particularly these two locations.

This place is cheap, efficient, and get the job done right. $2.50 for most items!! :-) They will also replace a button on a button down shirt at no charge! I've never had an issue here, the folks working there are quick and friendly.  I primarily have used cougar cleaners for my work attire.  My only reason for the lack of a 5 star review is when I needed my duvet cleaned. It's 100% cotton not fancy material or anything. It was $30 for the duvet and took over a week. Also for each sham was $5!! Considering their everyday items are so reasonable (and generally available next day) I was just floored. For my work dresses, button downs, pants and skirts I will absolutely continue to use Cougar as my primary dry cleaners. But for "specialty" items I will seek out a more economical and speedy service.

Yelp says "you've checked in two times. What keeps you coming back?" and the answer is -- I was craving sushi and there is nothing else near my office.  Everything about this place is just okay. The salmon sashimi was fresh, but pretty expensive in my opinion.  Salmon sashimi having the quality "fresh" is mandatory, not a compliment or above average.   I probably wouldnt recommend this place. In fact, I'll probably search for something else and be willing to exlore unchartered territory next time I get a craving for sushi when I'm at work.  I miss my lunch options in Scottsdale. Is the weekend almost here?

I love Barrio Queen's happy hour.  It starts at TWO!! and lasts 4 hours, AND is offered on weekends!! Admittedly, I have only really eaten off the happy hour or apps menu. But when in rome, why stray from the tacos? They're PERFECT! At 3 for $10, I almost always order two fish tacos and one shrimp. The beer battered fish is so delicious and tasty and so perfect to enjoy with thier margaritas. Despite other reviews, I argue that three are plenty to fill you up if you are looking to spend $10 on tacos, it is exactly what you should expect.  The tableside guacamole is a bit of an unnecessary presentation, but the end result is all we care about right? And Barrio Queen delivers on its guac! The pork dip appetizer is also very tasty, but a little too much fat for my tastes. I'm not a superfan of pork.   Regarding the service --- be nice, and they'll be nice back.  You can tell some of these folks have been around the block and are not a fan of catering to Scottsdale's elitist jerks.  But when you are friendly, smile-y, and honest -- you can be promised excellent service with a smile.   The ambience -- sit outside, just do it!! It is beautiful out there, there is usually live music playing nearby on the Cowboy Ciao corner or right at the canal.  Its just great to people watch and be watched by those who wish it was thier own taco time. Bring a coat in winter, and you'll still be happy. I've waited twenty minutes at the bar just to be able to dine outside. This is one of my favorite patios in old town.  Crowd is a total mixed vibe. Partiers still awake from last night right next to the snowbirds from Michigan, alongside a few baseball players and trophy wives. I've been fortunate that for the handful of times I've been here, I've never once seen any children of the annoying age group that make your meal distracting and keep your voice hushed.  I have no idea why Barrio Queen has ever been rated with less than 4 stars. Yes, I'm fairly easy to please when there is great outdoor seating and guacamole, but still - I think all around it is a great spot to check out and spend a few hours drinking house margs and munching on some tacos. :-)

This is not a fancy resort nail spa.    That being said, I loved the services I got and the price I paid. I went in on a weekday, approx 10am.  It was empty. I had seen a sign $20 hot stone pedi, and then i got inside and saw additional 20% if use cash only. So...I got a great hot stone pedicure for $18. The seats and foot soaks are very clean and new. My tech was perfect: quick, professional, thorough, and did a great job. I love that she didn't try to upsell me.   I would expect that many poor reviews for scheduling have to do with those coming at top peak hours -- for ANY nail salon, that is an issue during those hours. If you go into a salon in a weekend, budget two hours. Please don't expect the world to stop for you.   Try it out for a quick pedi..I dont think you'll be disappointed :)

I love the concept and offerings of Sprouts.  Food options and produce always seems so fresh. Sandwiches at deli are a steal, and fresh boar's head products, and they pack a lot in there.  Natural bath and body products, prices are not too impressive (they are average priced considering the quality and smaller lines) - but the selection is amazing and gives you plenty to choose from. Have some of the best natural lines of lotions and washes.   However -- this particular store needs to step up its game. I've stopped getting the natural nuts or grains b/c i've seen bugs in those cases one too many times. I've also seen some flies hanging around the muffin cases too often also. None of these incidents were one-time moments, this is a repeat pattern I've noticed.  Worst here -- the lines. The long a** lines. What a buzz kill. I want healthy fresh veggies that take me 30 seconds to find and 30 minutes to actually purchase. Seriously, i think we will all pay a little more to have another clerk available during peak hours. Those poor people working there, it just seems so understaffed.   I fully support Sprouts, its mission, its style, and focus.  But there needs to be better service all around. Service your store with a few more clerks who can help cash out and keep the cleanliness to a higher level

This place is acai-mazing! Seriously I'm sad I no longer live in the area so I can't frequent this place more often. They exclusively sell acai bowls, pitaya bowls, smoothies and some protein powder and quest bars. So.... don't come here for a sandwich and act surprised.  What I love... -nutrition facts available -chocolate peanut butter bowl -plentiful nuts and granola on top -even a small is super filling -satisfies my sweets craving with natural sugars -chocolate peanut butter bowl -perfect consistency. It's just like fro-yo. I've wasted time and money trying to make my own which are just smoothies.  - chocolate peanut butter bowl -consistent product -better bowls than Neckter for sure. (I've never had Thrive's smoothies so I can't speak to that)  Why is one star missing then?  - sometimes staffing issues. They seem to have solved weekend problems that I've had when they just opened. But sometimes I'll even call ahead on a weekday night and they say half hour to pick up. Really? You can get delivered whole entrees quicker than that! This is honestly just a matter of blending some fruit together. Despite their expertise (and my lack of) using a blender, its not worth a thirty minute wait.   So if you're not in a hurry or starving definitely stop by Thrive Acai Bowls. A good snack, dessert, or even a decent meal substitute if you get a medium or large size. I feel pretty confident you won't be disappointed

I like this place.  It sits in a plaza right by where I work out, and so on one of the many nights where I don't cook dinner, I decided to stop in.  I think it was around 5 or 6 on a weeknight. I ordered the quinoa salad, side shwarma, and the chicken and vegetable soup.  The chicken and vegetable soup is sooo good! There is a wide variety of veggies, I think squash and zucchini and carrots and it really tastes so homemade. I could eat that soup everyday.  The quinoa salad was fresh and perfect.  It had cucumbers and just enough dressing in it (olive oil) to make sure it wasn't dry. Much better than any of the ones at Whole Foods.  The shwarma side portion was a lot of meat, more than I anticipated.  It was very good also. I took the quinoa salad and shwarma home, there was enough of it, but it was so tasty that it didn't really last that long after :)  The food was great, the prices are extremely reasonable, but they needed a second server on the day I visited.  I sat at the little bar at the front and it just seemed a little chaotic.  The server was quick and good, but there were more people than she could handle, not her fault.  She was super sweet.   I wouldnt call this place fine dining, its definitely a great little meal spot to stay and enjoy your dinner or lunch.  Use your yelp check in and save 15% too!

Yay!! I'm a fan! I love Perfect Pair Bistro, I really wish I had one near me.  The menu is simple and healthy, easy to understand.  Happy hour wine, beer, and small plates are fair, all priced around $5, and even offered on weekends! Happy hour on cocktails are still sorta reasonable at $7.5 considering they don't skimp too much.   I've come here for an occasional dinner with my girlfriends who live in Awhatukee.  The first time I ordered a soup and quesadilla, both were so good! My most recent trip I ordered a soup and salad, again- hit it out of the park.  While these seem like easy orders, the taste and delivery is fresh and unique -- for example, my bistro salad had toasted hazelnuts, goat cheese, and a homemade vinaigrette dressing -- so different from the regular, stale, franchised taste of Paradise Bakery or Panera.   The menu is so simple to read with plenty of options. A section for sandwiches, grilled cheeses, pastas,, salads -- wide variety, but all listed separately in categories under same price.  The 1/2 and 1/2 mix is the way to go in my opinion to get a wider range of what's offered.  I cannot wait to explore more of the menu.   I've been here twice and i love the menu, ambiance, and concept for a casual bistro with great wine, beer and drink offerings. I deduct a star based on service.  Both times have been a Saturday, 6pm dinner, and we all felt rushed, despite plenty of open seating. We were a small group of girls catching up, chatting, having fun, and we were given our bill before being offered another glass of wine, or dessert, etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the staff to showcase more of the restaurant's talented menu selections.    All in all, I'll be returning.  But I just wish the service was a better part of the overall experience.

Wow. I'm so happy I came here, and cannot wait to come back!  Counter Intuitive is a craft cocktail space, with expertise behind the bar.  The space is limited, and fills up quickly. Luckily, stars aligned as my friend and I walked in, and two bar seats were available.  To be honest, I do not remember the name of the drinks I tried. The menu is elaborate and changes every six months. You choose your poison based on what sounds good, with a "complexity level" listed next to it, ranked 1-10. I had ordered a 6 and it was like a flavor bomb went off in my mouth. I was hooked. Hooked onto two more, probably more than I should've. But when in Rome....  This is a Must Try. I'll be returning ASAP.  Sometimes I just feel so lucky to live in this area. Counter Intuitive is definitely the latest reason why.

I love love love Hash Kitchen!! They have the best breakfast in Scottsdale, hands down.  I've had the crab benedict, the lemon pancakes, and the crab hash.  All items are ROCKSTAR!! The food, the flavors, the fun ambience, I wish they stayed open for dinner!   Apparently the secret is out though -- weekends, expect to wait. Expect to wait, and then have mediocre service. Our server took about 15 minutes to get to us, and then when we asked for the check, it took another 20 minutes and there were two items that we didn't order.   I've been there during the week though, and the service during less crowded times is on point and friendly and quick and accurate.  My only suggestion here would be to hire one or two more servers for the weekend hussle and bussle.  Otherwise, this place is absolutley amazing and I'm so glad its right around the corner from me.

First I should say that I absolutely love barre....but that being said there is still always good or bad. The program at TenPoint5 is AWESOME.  They have three locations- Tempe, Chandler, and Scottsdale. I've been to all three and when I lived in Tempe I was a daily attender to that studio where Christa and Sarah run the show and they really push you to your limits. Classes with Sarah are always killer she knows if you're only giving 100% and she'll make you push to the 105% that they promise. It's a love/hate with a Sarah class, in a totally good way :-)  This review is specific to the Scottsdale location though, where JoAnne and Bebo run a tight ship...Tight legs, abs, and tush!! They are great instructors and so super friendly. The class times offered are varied and give you no excuses to miss out on toning your body. The studio is modern, clean, and intimate so that you always know your form is being looked at and perfected whenever necessary. They also send out newsletters, tips, promos, etc.  This keeps me attached to my TP5 family and up on the latest deals. Check out my pic where I'm Rockstar of The Barre last month. ;-)  My favorite part about TenPoint5 class offerings is Biker Barre... 40 min of barre and 20 min of spin. It's THE BEST!! It combines a heart racing spin class with a great thorough barre program and great stretching which is often ignored in a typical spin class. I'm addicted and it isn't offered anywhere else in the valley. I really think Biker Barre sets TenPoint5 waaayyyy on top of the others.   In short--I'm so happy that TenPoint5 opened closer to me after I moved to Scottsdale. It's made my workouts come full circle again.

This place is within a 1/4 mile of where I live. I don't cook all that often and I still plan to avoid this place unless things get really desperate at home.  It is no longer really about the new-factor anymore in my opinion. The service is quite fine, but it's just the quality that turns me off from ever recommending this place.  I ordered a half chicken salad sandwich. I should mention that I am really pleased that Togos posts nutrition facts and uses light mayo in their chicken and tuna salads. Regardless, the salad itself tasted just bad. The scoop was tiny, and overwhelmed by the doughy bread it was served on. There was more lettuce and tomatoes than chicken salad on my sandwich so it just completely tasted like a waste of any chicken salad at all. What I did get from the chicken was just the flavor of salty mayo.   I try not to be high maintenance with my sandwiches and I'm just disappointed. Jimmy johns is a much better option if you're in a pinch for a healthy and quick sandwich.

I love this place and concept!!!  I've been here several times and each time have had sweetheart service with a smile and a delicious meal for super cheap!  I've ordered most of thier soups by now, and the veggie omlet.  All of thier soups are just $3 and if you get the chance, definintely order the Italian Wedding Soup.  The portion is very large, and the meatballs fill you up plenty.  The broth of this soup is so delish, it has egg in it also so its a bit on the thick side. It is a rockstar and makes me so happy that I had it both times when I visited last week!   The omlete is perfect, exactly what I expected. Fresh veggies and just perfectly made.    They do not serve quick coffee. Every glass is a pourover because they said whenever a pot is made, it doesn't go quickly enough and it ends up wasting money. I wish they had better hours so I could visit more often.   If you didn't read about it already, this is a non-profit organization where everything you buy goes directly to feed people in the area who cannot afford it.  I love eating good food and feeling good about where the money is going.  Doesn't get much better than that :)

I am a dessert fiend. I wish apps and desserts made a healthy diet.  I was driving home a few weeks ago and zeroed in on what seemed to be a new bakery in my 'hood. Woohooo!!!!  Yesterday I had off work and promised myself a trip to this new sweet spot.   Sweet indeed!!!! Sweet ice cream, sweet cupcakes, sweet employees!!! I stood frozen, paralyzed with indecision. I was praying they would be more than just good frosting like Sprinkles. Prayers answered, Hallelujah!!!! After asking a question about almost each cupcake I settled on the employees recommendation, the chocolate sundae cupcake. First let me tell you I'm an icing girl. At a birthday party my plate is always left with scraped/licked off icing and a plate of cake. At Smallcakes my plate was left half and half. Only reason I didn't eat the whole thing is bc it is indeed very sweet. Delicious moist cake, delicious icing, delicious filling. My only recommendation would be more center filling, but I'm pretty gluttonous so it can't be really held against Smallcakes. I also sampled their fresh made ice cream. There are approx 8 flavors I think but I tried the Carrot cake and Cookies and Cream. Both sssooo fresh tasting and amazingly delish! This place will likely generate a ton of traffic in an otherwise unsuspecting plaza. Get your cupcaking on, Yelpers!!!

I stopped in here for happy another one of those common themed days when I'm too hungry to cook after work. It is fairly new so the place was pretty empty but it was GORGEOUS!!! It's so nicely decorated and modern and inviting! I loved just looking around.  I sat at the bar and ordered the salmon croquettes and chicken soup. So, to be fair, I went safe with the menu. I also ordered their signature cocktail mule, it was very good.  My meal had a tremendous amount of flavor. They made chicken noodle soup so extraordinary it was delicious I could eat that everyday for lunch. The portion was just right to accompany either an entree or hearty app. I chose the hearty app with the salmon croquette. It was so tasty and even though I was full, I ate each and every one :-). Yum!!! The sauce that went w the salmon was also very flavorful.  I should mention that while full of flavor, it was not confused. It was a very deliberate mix of spices and ingredients. It was very "vanilla" for Indian food, so if you want a small step into this cuisine then definitely check out Indo Fusion.

I'm excited about this place, especially living right around the corner.  I stopped by yesterday in leui of going grocery shopping. I chose mid-afternoon to watch tv, grab a snack and a sunday cocktail.   The happy hour is pretty legit.  Wines are $3 off, cocktails are $3 off, and beer $2 off, making most drinks around the $7-8 range --- i wouldnt necessarily say great for happy hour drink prices, but considering the nice wine selection and finely crafted cocktails (not well liquors).  The food on thier happy hour though, looks delish.  I had the crispy chicken sliders, full of flavor, pretty filling, and for $8 an awesome steal.  I looked at thier full menu and i'll be back for a lobster roll - i'm thinking probably within the week.  Yes, it was one of those places that i want to return to ASAP.  I think this place has sticking power.  There have been a lot of in-and-out restruaunts in this location, but I hope Drexyl sticks around.  I heard the bartender say that lunch will be offered soon also. I can't wait!!

I love these Elite events - I love Yelp for the varied group of people who enjoy food and fun and meeting new people just as much as I do :-)  This event started with two sample drinks, preview drinks that they do not yet offer on thier menu. Since I don't like bourbon, I went with the See No Evil, a rum/blackberry mix that was sweet and refreshing. I liked everything about it.  My favorite app was the salt and pepper shrimp. The shrimp was obviously fresh, and it was seasoned just perfectly. The entrees came out, and I really enjoyed the Manchurrian chicken most of all.  All of the dishes had tremendous flavor of such a variety of seasonings, but not overdone. The ambiance is nice for when you want a nice seat-down Asian restaurant to relax and enjoy a meal with good company.  And luckily, Yelp Elites provide some great company!!
