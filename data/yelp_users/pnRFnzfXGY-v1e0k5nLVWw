Absolutely the worst customer service. I had to be put on medical leave and had a note from my doctor which ended up to be a complete headache. They told me the wrong info over the phone for cancellation. When I went into the club they were rude. If you are going to spend the money I would just go to the village. They at least take care of their members.

I go here to see Roger and love the consistency I get. He keeps up to date with all the new techniques and truly cares how your hair turns out. I love the new remodel and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. All the stylists are extremely skilled and are very knowledgable and honest about the products they sell. I highly recommend trying them out!

I have been going to Roger for a few years now. He is the best I've had for blonde! My hair is never damaged or brassy and always has great dimension. My roots are much more discreet than previous stylists because of the technique he uses. Love the blowout packages he offers as well.. They are way less and a blow dry bar and last just as long. Thank you Roger!

Priscilla is so detail oriented. She is the only person I trust with my eyebrows. She is extremely knowledgeable with skincare and has great peels and masques for pigmentation. I go to her for everything!

Great service this past weekend, these guys are a class act. They did some work on one of my investors homes and that an excellent job replacing both springs. I've use these guys in several cities and they always do a great job. They showed up on time and solve the problem, you don't have to worry about up sells.  Very impressed and I will be using a1 garage door service for a long time to come. Last time I had a come up to my Arizona home I had them replace the garage door opener with a LiftMaster, great choice this unit has been great for the last couple years.

I have been to several naturopathic doctors since I moved here. Dr. Steinborn is knowledgable and exactly what I was looking for. I have been getting b12 shots from him for about 6 months. He did a hormone analysis and actually knows the endocrine system inside and out. Since I have been seeing him I have cut my body fat down significantly and feel better than I've ever felt. His prices are beyond fair and he really cares about each patient. I highly recommend him if you are looking to loose weight and explore anti aging programs.
