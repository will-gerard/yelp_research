I would always recommend asking for melony for a haircut, she's been cutting for 20 years and knows how to cut hair. I'm not too sure about others but I strongly recommend choosing her! She's cut my hair for years and I absolutely adore her.

The food is great when they do it right but otherwise my orders are mostly wrong. I get cold buns and burnt patties and when I ask for ketchup they forget most of the time. I would recommend another in n out.

Poor gym with poor lack of customer service.

Maybe it was a busy day since it was Rainbow Fest. Still, the crust was incredibly thin and burnt. They skimped on the tomato sauce leaving it rather dry. I felt cheated of $20 for a pizza I could have easily attempted and burned just as well as them.  tl;dr  Its overly expensive, burnt, and not enough tomato sauce.   Best pizza ever   10/10.

I'd say it's closest to one of the best dance club/bars in Arizona (aside from charlies). The go go dancers are delicious, the drinks are great, and the crowd is very approachable. They offer different deals every night and on Fridays they do drag shows. The space itself is large enough but not as big as charlies. There are mostly young adults from 21-30, I suppose the location scares away most older men. People there are very friendly to talk to, you just have to be able to open yourself up!  I come here all the time and honestly I can say it's probably the best bar in Arizona. It's not perfect but it's what we got! :)

Small selection to choose from as well for toppings, as well the staff are rude and annoying.

Pita jungle is one of those special restaurants that make me feel great once I walk in. Instead of all the employees wearing a company outfit, they rather wear everyday clothes which I feel makes it feel less corporate and more relaxing and enjoyable. Not to mention all the servers have a great personality. Moving on, the food is incredible, they have food that everyone will atleast like one of the many choices. I truly recommend this place for not only the service, food, but also the prices, its very reasonable for everything you pay for.

Nearest Starbucks by me, myself and my boyfriend visit all the time. Its a great Starbucks to attend but depending on the Barista, some tend to pound those up-charges on your drink. I recommend it, its a great location!

Rude employees who aren't very intelligent or have much of a personality. I had a shirt done here and they put holes in it. I would not recommend this cleaners.

Slightly better than dominos/pizza hut/little Caesars but the price doesn't pay for quality and amount of pizza. Save your money instead for another pizza place. Seriously 20 bucks for a medium sized pizza?

Just visited here recently and I was severely disappointed. The toppings were stale and the prices were way too high. Oh well, back to Mojo's!
