Now, I have seen Bourdain eat here, I've read up on the joint from various food blogs and on-line culinary magazines, but other than remembering to order from the Northern Thai section of the menu all other specific knowledge went out the window because I was so god damn drunk! Apparently, I am told, I couldn't even recall where the bathroom was despite the fact I had just relieved myself there only fifteen minutes prior.  F*cking Slot Waitresses. F.S.W.  But I did remember to take pictures dear readers and I can say everything we ordered was not only downright delectable but tasted just as good, if not better, than anything that I ate in the four weeks I spent in Thailand.  Yes. I said it. And I stand by it with my FlavorBoner held high.   Nam Prik Ong (Red Chili Dip w/ ground pork) intended to be a starter to your meal, is not too spicy and has just the right amount of sweet from the ground pork. It is awesome with the crudités and chicharones served with it. The cool from the vegetables and the heat from the dip work really well together, even for a drunk ass like myself.  Hey. It was a long drive, all right, and I was on a mission. So... whatever.   Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice) The center of the rice was perfectly moist and soft and the outside was sensationally crunchy. How they did that I have no idea. There was an overall wonderful ginger/lime flavor going on in this dish with flame coming from the green onion and fresh chilies.  Yum!   Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Fresh, house made, Thai spicy pork sausage. Enough said. Either you get it or you don't. No need to sell it.  "A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy!"  -- Alec Baldwin, Glengarry Glen Ross  Garlic Prawn. Deep fried in their shell, this dish has a potato chip crunch to it and it's so frickin' garlicky. And I mean that in the best possible way. This is a not to be missed dish for those of you who do not dig anything with hoofs.  Then there was our little crispy drunken Daffy, the Crispy Duck Drunken Noodle. The skin on the bird was indeed crispy and salty. Her meat tender and juicy. The vegetables were cooked yet firm and the bird-based broth that the slippery, wide noodles bathed in was the perfect compliment to the other spicy dishes as it smoothed everything out.  Now not all of the dishes we ordered were from the Northern Thai portion of the menu that everyone recommended, some were chef's choices others, like the drunken noodle, were personal favorites.  Just order what you want. It's your meal. Everything here will be good. You are not going to go wrong.

I love this hotel. Not because its the newest or swankest. Not because it has the finest restaurants in Las Vegas but because it is one of the friendliest. The people who work there, save for one Filipino woman at the M Life station, are all amazing. They genuinely care about the quality of your stay and the rooms, specifically, the beds are incredibly comfortable.   I am a slots whore and they have an amazing and diverse selection to play.   And you can't beat the prices for their rooms. Very reasonable. If you play their games, they comp you and they appreciate your patronage in a very old school way. Not in a contemporary, insincere way. They want your business whereas other, newer hotels make you feel like you are just lucky to be there.   I feel at home at this hotel. I feel respected and I feel joy.   Come to the Mirage people and judge for yourself.

This is by far my favorite dive bar in Las Vegas and if you give it chance, it will probably end up being yours too.   It's not just divey, it's dingy. It's Raw. It's unadulterated and it's sinful.   You come here to dig deep down into your nasty soul and exercise your inner demons.   You come to be amongst the damned. And being damned never felt so good.   The decor harkens me back to the days of CBGD's in NYC when rock was punk and hangovers were something to aim for, not to avoid.   They host live bangs and have a killer juke box and a cigarette machine (which is reason enough to visit the joint).   They have 50's tv sets mounted along the bar which steams 24/7 (as they never close) violent and perverse animated cartoons and exploitation film trailers. Note: Dare you to be on psychedelics here. I double down dare you.   They have a signature drink called 'Ass Juice' and they advertise it with an illustration of a skeleton figure squatted over a toilet squirting fire water out of its ass.   I know I'm in. Brilliant advertising if you ask me.   The customers are mostly people who work and live in Las Vegas which I like to surround myself with as much as possible when I visit their fare city. If you happen to hang there past 5 or 6 am you might see an influx of strippers getting off work and blowing off some steam which is a whole other level of free entertainment.   The slogan is "SHUT UP AND DRINK" which is a maxim that I am happy to stand behind. Even if you think you are not the breed of cat that would enjoy yourself here. I challenge you to come on by and give it an hour.  It is a non-judgmental place. All are united under this tent of debauchery and I think it will speak to some part of you, however small.

So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, finest brunch buffets in Las Vegas.  Now it isn't called the "Sterling" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs big time.  Most of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I usually avoid buffets in general as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.  When you are seated you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and moist. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.  As a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.  Next up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.  Um, yes.  Out of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too much valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.  Now the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch stands out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, crème fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.  Egg me, baby.  The caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.  Now, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.  I sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.  Adeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.  Sterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality.

The spa at The Wynn is comfortable, luxurious and quiet. They have a very classic, old money vibe that blends well with a contemporary feel. They are definitely catering to the high end clientele here and for a spa it should.   Spas are our gift to ourselves. A time to heal and to spoil. Even if you don't make a shit ton of money, you should treat yourself to this kind of experience.   Thick, pillowy towels. Silky robes. Warm steam baths. Citrus water. Chaise lounge chairs. Whirlpool baths. These are the things that inspire tranquility and a higher quality of life.   Not to mention perfect for your expensive hangover.   I prefer the spa at the Encore over the one at the Wynn but the Wynn is the one I have been to most recently and I've just starting 'Yelping' on the regular over the past year.   The bonus to the spa at the 'Encore' is that they have Roman size hot bathes that are bonkers. These are swimming pools of warm, muscle relaxing love. They also have 'waterfall' showers.   You can only imagine what that feels like. Also, The Encore has heated lounge chairs...pretty money.   The thing about The Wynn spa though is because is just has the stylish basics, it is less in demand and not as crowded so if you have to go on a peek hour you are assured the privacy and solitude that one expects with a spa.  The Encore being the pimped out version and more popular there will be some folks.   So the choice is yours.   Your Spa Fiend.   Eric

These stars are for the mere fact that Bally's has two things. Star Wars Video slots which is a VERY HARD game to come by and they have it right next to Deal Or No Deal and Clue! Second, they have the best brunch in Vegas with their 'Sterling Brunch'. I have not stayed in Bally's in a very long time so I can't speak to their rooms but I want to start a trend and make the older hotels on the strip more popular...who's with me?

This is an amazing buffet. $40+ dollars per person and totally worth it. Great breakfast and awesome meat counter. I didn't have room for dessert or the Asian delights but the other diners seemed very happy.   My Highlights are...  Mac and Cheese - zesty and spicy - YUM!  Eggs Benedict with Corned Beef Hash - the eggs are poached perfectly and the hollandaise is rich.  Fried Chicken - ask for tabasco at you table - wonderfully seasoned Hand carved Bacon - this is a meat / bacon lover's must. Amazingly salty and sweet.  Cheddar Scrambled Eggs - soft, moist, creamy - shockingly well prepared.

Though it is not much of a secret anymore, Secret Pizza is a darling little gem and not to be missed when visiting Las Vegas. On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.  It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.  The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.  I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.  They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.  When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the true genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.  My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.  Dig in and don't let go!  Secret Pizza you get the FlavorBoner trophy on this trip.  I'll be wrapping my teeth around you soon, just not during nightclub hours as I have heard the line is way too insane.  BTW....  When at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, if it is a weekend or holiday, go to the Chandelier Lounge on the main floor. They have a band called MARK and The Martinis and they are excellent. The lead singer embodies all that is classic Las Vegas; he sings, he jokes, he interacts with the patrons. He does Sinatra, Dean and Sammy proud.

The Gaudi Bar is a bit of a trek as it is in the Sunset Station Hotel in  Henderson, NV. Nine miles off the strip. The reason to go... The Gaudi Bar.  Inspired by the Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi, the Gaudi bar embraces the traditions of Catalan Modernism and it is an amazing surrealistic experience.  This is unlike any bar you will find, not only in the Vegas area, but also in the US. The architecture goes beyond the circle bar and into the casino area. The color, lights, and molten cavernous ceilings draw you in and overwhelm you with curiosity and awe.

When visiting downtown Las Vegas you cannot skip the historic El Cortez Hotel and Casino. It is an iconic institution, one worth stopping in and helping it remain relevant, and they've added a couple of cool things to help entice you.  1.).... free White Castle Cheeseburgers to slots and table customers on Thursdays and holidays! F*ck yeah!  How awesome is that!? They wheel these little fatty bitches in a steam cart to all of those numbed asses, sitting, smoking, pulling levers and pushing buttons... me being one of them.  Then there is the other, and more consistent reason to visit, The Parlour. This medium sized cocktail lounge nestled in the back of the hotel lobby has only been around a few years but it feels like it has been there since the beginning; and that is what the ownership was going for.  A taste of old Vegas in a fresh new space.  They have a piano area and on Wednesdays from 8pm - 12pm they have a crooner who sings Frank Sinatra, and on Saturdays from 6pm - 10 pm they have an Elvis Impersonator.  Scottie, quite possibly the nicest bartender I have ever met, makes a mean Bloody Mary and even though I normally don't like them, I have to admit it's one of the best I have ever tasted and a great hangover cure.  Our time here whizzed by and I could see myself spending an entire afternoon or early evening here. It is a great place to go after brunch or before dinner. I highly recommend.  It is also worth checking out El Cortez' Cabana Suites across the street as a hotel option. If you are looking for just a downtown Las Vegas experience which, believe it or not, with all the new development going on there is an strong argument for that choice, I think it is a great option, one that I am considering for my next trip.

Andiamo Italian restaurant is the reason to come here. The bar area is impressive as it stretches almost completely from one end of the casino floor to the other. They have female dancers performing above and along the gambling tables and the atmosphere is lively but mostly just chaotic.   It's just damn too hectic for me to call it enjoyable. If you are looking to get wasted and reckless in DTLV then this place might be the joint for you because that is pretty much all I saw going on.

Velveteen Rabbit. The name alone should peek your curiosity. We all know the children's book The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams.  The story of a stuffed rabbit that becomes real through the love of his owner. It is one of my favorites and now this bar is one of mine.   It's simple. It's charming, and it's a nice quiet quaint reprieve from the norm. It's a locals' hangout for locals who want a little modern sophistication with their liquor. The accent that places this joint into the four star category is the Mason jar chandeliers that delicately light up the space. It is truly wondrous just like the children's book.   My lady and I ordered the 'Whezzin' the Juice' which is an urban term meaning sticking your mouth underneath a beverage tap.  It is a bourbon-based cocktail with root liquor, vanilla, angostura, mint and crushed ice. It was basically an awesome non-carbinated root beer soda. The cocktail menu changes seasonally so don't be confused if you don't see it.  Congrats to the owners, they loved their rabbit enough to see it turn real.

The rooms are gorgeous and the junior suites have glass views of the shower from the bedroom which is pretty cool if you ask me. The decor is French inspired. Oh, and there is a mirror above your bed, why I am not sure :)   The robes are insanely comfortable, I didn't want to change into clothes. I would have played slots in that robe if I could have.   The hotel itself has a boutique feel and by contrast to places like Planet Hollywood and The Cosmopolitan. It stands out because it's scope is smaller and not focusing as hard on the gambling aspect as identifying itself as a resort. The stores are refined, the pool area lovely.  The service was friendly and professional and I thought there list of restaurants was impressive (though being from LA not new because a lot of their food options originated in LA).   It sits between DTLV and the Strip and if you like to visit both and have to stay in one or the other the location is ideal.   I am always a fan of checking out new hotels because the rooms are new going to be cleaner, the beds new more comfortable.   I would check this place out on your next visit.

Horrible brisket. I love Rudy's. I first learned about Rudy's when I lived in Austin and I fell in love with their moist brisket. A year or so ago I was in Phoenix and I went to the other location (the higher rated one btw) and I found the quality and flavor to be the same. I was in Phoenix again this weekend and dropped in to this location for the same moist brisket and it was dry and rubbery. I ordered a 1/2 pound (the minimum) and ate four bites off of four different slices and all of them were awful. Avoid this location. I don't know what they are doing but whatever it is, it's doing the chain a disservice.
