to be fair... I love the food...it was the service. Well, it was fast, but the girl was rude and kept rushing me ( THERE was nobody behind me) My hubby and I were ordering take out. I knew what my daughter and her boyfriend wanted and I was trying to place their order. "Miss Rude" evidently didn't want to take the order separately- she wanted to take  4 orders ALL AT ONCE and shovel the food in as quickly and as messy as she possible could. When I told her I wasn;t ready to order - that I wanted to look at the menu - she gave me an attitude, and said she wanted to do them all together. My hubby steps up and makes his order she rolls her eyes at me and after  the third time I told her I was still deciding she gave me more attitude. To be fair, I can see her being impatient IF there was a line behind me. There was not. And ----- the  other three orders together  took all of 45 seconds- yes that fast) About his time I had it with her bitchiness and said  (politely) that she's wasting time waiting on me when she can finish the other three orders ( more attitude from  worker with big spoon). The food was 'slopped' in the the  to go bowls. She needs, in my opinion, a refresher course in how to deal with customers. I was not rude, I could've been, but she was rude enough for both. I was hoping there was an email address to this particular Chipotle's here(on Yelp)  to send to the manager but I don;t see one. Chipotle is a great place to eat.. they just need to remember that whom they hire in the front line represents their company. They don't need and shouldn't ever have someone so rude up front.

5th Ave Cafe is usually where I go to for a great -better than home- breakfast...and I love it...but this weekend we went there to celebrate my hubby's birthday...for lunch! IT WAS AWESOME! WE had 12 people and - can I say- that usually a large party would have to wait because the kitchen couldn't handle such a large order at once BUT NOT at 5th Ave Cafe. Our food was out so fast, it was unexpected. Dawn was so kind, she insisted that I enjoy my hubby's birthday and she even took pictures and cut & served the cake. The food was excellent, the servers are awesome and I couldn't have asked for a better place. From the bus peeps to the servers to the chefs/cooks to the owners- THE BEST PLACE EVER! They cater too...we will always make time to go to 5th Ave Cafe for breakfast & lunch (killer Patty Melt, BTW) but NOW, we have a place to celebrate birthdays, Anniversary's  and really any occasion where we want to have great food and enjoy the time. THANK YOU 5th Ave Cafe!! OH- just a side note...a few week ago I ordered the sausage & eggs - I didn't eat the sausage...when they picked up my plate the owner found his way over to our table and asked if there was something wrong. I was surprised  because I didn't know what he was talking about. He went on to say that he noticed I didn't eat the sausage and wanted to know if I was unhappy. I told him, no, it was fine, I just don't like the casings. He sad, no problem to let them know and they'll remove the casings....I was impressed! These people really want to make you happy.. try it- you'll love it!!

Dr Downs and the whole staff at Mountain Vista have been exceptionally kind, friendly, professional & extremely knowledgeable. I've only been seeing Dr Downs for a couple of weeks but seriously, after the first meeting with him, I knew I made the right decision to see him. I always thought that there really wasn't much to chiropractic care but I was wrong! I was accustomed to feeling  "out of sorts", I figured, at my age, you're suppose to feel the aches and pains and to just  suck it up and get used to it. I kid you not, after the very first appointment, I woke up the next morning with NO ACHES & PAINS... I thought it was a fluke. It was not. I am on the road to feeling well and it makes me want to be more proactive in my health. After visiting with the staff, I am convinced that, if I want to be pain free and motivated to do & eat the right foods, Mountain Vista Health Center will steer me in the right direction. I am so happy my husband found this center & Dr. Downs. He's not JUST a Chiropractor, this center is a Wellness center. Thank you!

Hmmmm, I love the name of this place. I have a friend that I meet every month for breakfast so we can catch up with each other's lives. . Every month we pick a new, different place. Sometimes they're just okay, other times it's on our list to return. Egg I AM is a place we plan to meet again our next visit. It was clean, the staff was extremely kind and attentive and it was a place that we could easily chat and not strain to hear each other. (some places are not conducive to conversation). I had a great experience and the food was excellent. The potatoes are called ranch potatoes and were really tasty. I thought it was a great choice...I suggest you give it a try for yourself.  I loved it!

If you love Italian food, THIS is the place to go! The food speaks for itself, I could eat it everyday. From the salads to the sliders- OMG!!! I love the Eggplant Parmesan, I actually crave this food. The garlic knots are awesome and you kind of get a show out of the owner. His catch phrase- "hey- who's betta than you?" Nobody!"...  Great prices-, very, very reasonable!  The owner could easily charge so much more for the big taste you get out of this food. Italian food is my favorite so, I've been to so many.....I've been to the little hidden spots to  Italian restaurants that are "high end" and they're excellent- but you pay through the nose- -THIS food is so much better and ,as I stated above reasonably priced. Oh save room for the dessert...kind of like a brownie with cannoli "stuff"...EXCELLENT!!!

I have never had less than great service here. They are friendly, fast and accurate. I will say that there have been a few times when I couldn't understand what they were trying to say, especially at the drive thru- but as a whole, I have no complaints....well, except when I ask for ice tea and they omit the ice...but just means more tea for me. I love their iced tea...

Let me start by saying I AM a fan of SNOOZE - (and for all I have to say you may want to take a snooze- or heck, you may even snooze before you're done reading...but) I have been to SNOOZE a myriad of times - and GENERALLY the food/service is outstanding. But today....eh not so much. Today is my daughter's birthday. She wanted to celebrate with a breakfast instead of the traditional dinner...and she wanted SNOOZE. (YES!- I thought to myself...love Snooze). I went online to see if I was able to make a reservation. Unfortunately, no. No reservations are accepted. No worries, my hubby and I will get there when they open and get a table for 12. Well, we got there about 7:20ish and they were already getting busy. Good thing we got there early, right? That really didn't matter, although they(Snooze peeps) were kind enough to let us wait by the window, they really didn't want to hold a table for that many for that long a time. People were to come about 8am - which was about 40 minutes from then. When I asked if they use the tables, would we still be able to get seated when everyone arrived. I was told the turn around is usually about an hour so  there would be a few minute wait. (WAIT? That's why we arrived early - - so we could get a table  large enough to accommodate our family). Okay...I didn't want to be unreasonable or worse a  B-WORD - so I said...well, okay....well, see how this works. If timing were to be on our side, the tables should come free before everyone arrived. EH..not so much. That's okay... I DO realize the world doesn't revolve around our family. SO.....we waited. And waited!  .....and after asking  (twice) if they could give an estimate on how much longer we'd be waiting ----well, they were kind and said it looks as if the people were getting ready to leave. We waited....and waited some more....until  finally, yes!, we are able to be seated. The server, whose name I did not see, already seemed stressed....(trust me, I know stress, so I can spot it!) He was quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink. Coffee, coffee, coffee is our reply... Several minutes later he comes with a dark beverage that should be hot - but isn't and should be coffee - but it is not. When we ask if we could have some hot coffee instead of the tea that was brought to us, he argued a tiny bit and said, "no, it's coffee, it came from the same section" - I was a bit perplexed and honestly, I really did not want to be a B-WORD but I didn't understand the "same section" comment nor did I grasp the thought that he didn't get that if everyone said it tasted like tea, why he didn't just say, I'm sorry, I'll bring another cup. He repeated the "Same section" comment and then said something about maybe we weren't used to their particular coffee bean. You know they grind it themselves (sarcasm noted). While he was trying to figure out the coffee/tea thang, many minutes have past...we still haven't ordered and quite frankly I was wishing we had gone elsewhere. While we did eventually  get real coffee, that wasn't before he told us that he tasted it and "it IS coffee." Implying, I suppose that we don't know the difference between coffee & tea. I assure you, you don't need to be a coffee AND tea connoisseur, to know the difference! Okay, we order, he starts at the other end of the table...no problems here....until, he gets to my dad, who is sitting next to me. My dad is 84 years and, as people might be at that age a bit grumpy & hard of hearing- oh yeah, and set in his ways. He has every right. He doesn't like butter or anything that tastes like butter so after he ordered I said to the server just that - please don't cook in butter...perhaps basted? The server, said to me, rather curtly, he wants to hear it from him(my dad) because too many people ordering will surely make it wrong and he wants to be sure he gets what he wants. He actually reprimanded me for speaking on my dads behalf. He very well dismissed me and only wanted to speak to my dad. I KNOW this as true, because, well the server told me so. HELLO! I was aghast that this server would say this to any customer. I then asked him if he were having a bad day, because it seems as if he was annoyed before he started taking our order. I was trying to break the ice but he wanted no part of this. He quickly - and I mean quickly(!) dismissed me & my comments and said that  (again) the coffee was is the same section. Okay maybe this is some kind of restaurant lingo that I am not privy to - however, he seemed bothered by the coffee tea thang. By this time we were happy with our coffees and just wanted to celebrate the birthday. Fast forward - we get the ordering done, they brought the food out in a more than normal time frame - but given there were 12 of us, that is to be expected.   I have to wrap this up, It's too long. Basically, some of the food was cold (maybe it was in the "same section" but they did take it off the bill. Would I go back? Yes, but not with a large group.

Tried this quaint little Pizza place on a Saturday evening. We were expecting good things because we read the reviews on YELP. We were not at all disappointed. Nice, clean, friendly servers (see punctuation changes everything....actually, the place was nice & clean & I assume the servers were too;-). I ordered the garlic monkey rolls & jalapeno mac & cheese. The small size was too big to finish. My hubby ordered the 'pub burger' (he IS a burger connoisseur) and actually told the server ( I forgot her name) it was the best burger he's ever had. The portions are huge and the service was excellent. We will  go back again. If  I had to pick a not so nice word to say it would be  that the music was (JUST a tad bit) loud and could stand to be turn down a notch or two (my opinion only) - but other than that..EXCELLENT!!!!  Great dining experience
