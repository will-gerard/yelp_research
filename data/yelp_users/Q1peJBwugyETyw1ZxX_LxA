Did I just pee outside?  I think I just peed into a cascading waterfall deep in the wilderness. This place rocks.

Nothing good to say about this airport. Terrible selection of seemingly always understaffed restaurants and bars (i.e. Home Team Sports in terminal b, what a joke), total lack of charging areas so people are scattered on the floor along hallways plugged into outlets next to restrooms, ridiculously inconvenient access between terminals c and b if you have a transfer, the list goes on. Sadly, if you are here, it's probably because you need to fly on a plane and you have no choice. So grab a shot with your beer and enjoy a cold prepackaged sandwich out of a cooler. Cheers.

Alright. This place deserves 5 stars based on the exceptionally tasteful house music and the ridiculously delicious steaks. The waitresses,  while attractive, fell very short when asked questions about the menu and wine list. They also seemed to lack communication with the kitchen staff as there was general confusion about when our orders were going to be coming out. I would come back with a crew of buddies to dine before we roll out to the clubs.

Let's be honest - I was looking for a budget place and that's what I got. Internet was worthless in my room. Awful for the business traveler. The place is like a maze, once you park you can barely figure out how to get to your room.  And once you're inside it is difficult to exit without a key if you're parked on the back side. Not only is that a pain, you also don't want to spend much time walking through the stained carpet hallways...trust me. The AC unit was erratic, it seemed to stop working between 4 and 8am when I would wake up in a sweat with all my sheets thrown off. One plus side is that the pillows were pretty comfortable.

I started to browse a menu from my table after sitting down for breakfast, and was immediately grossed out by what appeared to be avocado smeared on the first page. I grabbed the other one... Grease stains. Maybe chorizo. Let's try the next table over... Definitely salsa on this one.  As I'm sitting there squinting at other tables trying to spot a new-looking menu, a female server whooshes over to my table with a scowl and snatches one of the grimy menus and returns it to the table that I took it from. No welcome, no hello... Just a hit and run menu snatching.  Luckily she was not my server; I don't think that we would have gotten along.  My server turned out to be Maggie, who was prompt and friendly.  Thanks to her my day got started with about 4 glasses of coffee and a smile.    No help from the food though, or the prices. I got the huevos, scrambled, with chorizo, home fries, and tortillas. The plate lacked any sort of garnish (cheese?  Sour cream? Pico de gallo?) and the side of salsa I asked for was 3 bucks. 3 bucks for a couple spoonfuls of salsa!!?  Good thing I didn't know about that charge til I got my bill, or I might have had a salsa free breakfast. The 'home fries' reminded me of the chewy cubes of frozen potatoes you used to get in middle school cafeteria with your French Toast sticks and oj with a peel back aluminum lid.    3 bucks for a side of salsa??!?  You kidding me?!    You'd be better off getting a Naked Juice protein shake from the Hudson's News store and coming here for booze if you feel so inclined.

What sounded like a promising and even delicious burger, the Buffalo Ranch, arrived at my table as a total disappointment. To start with, the "seasoned" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were "seasoned" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).  At least the server Brandon was a nice guy and he offered to remove the burger from my check. For this, and the fact that the place serves beer and has sports on tv, Fox gets two stars.

I'm always devastated when I have to fly out of the B  gates because I know that this is the only place you can go to get a drink.  The smell of the bar is vomit-inducing; it reminds me of a cheap college bar where they play Lil Wayne and coeds grind on each other while spilling beer all over the slippery floor.  I can't imagine what Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue would find at the bottom of the ice bin here, but I guarantee you it would be disgusting and rhyme with "old".  Hungry?  Get ready to enjoy some cellophane wrapped sandwiches that make the selection at Circle K look like gourmet fare.  Do yourself a favor and starve yourself until you get to your next destination. And if you're craving a buzz, bring a bunch of mini shots in your bag and suck em down while playing the slots.

Distrito = Distrito Federal, i.e. Mexico City. I like the low light atmosphere and great selection of craft cocktails. The Mezcal Mule was legit, got that true smokey mezcal flavor in a strong dose.   The menu uses some really creative ingredients and the dishes are exciting, including some desserts that are downright beautiful to look at.  You wouldn't think to include cilantro in a dessert but it worked perfectly (can't remember name, crema something maybe?).  Also tried the coconut cream chicken enchiladas. Unique flavor, I was a big fan. Unfortunately the insides of the enchiladas were cold, despite being served on a hot iron skillet.   The previous evening I had the salmon ceviche, which was incredible, and the carne asada. The carne asada tasted great despite being too tough to chew in parts, must have  been a tad unlucky with that cut. Regardless, I will keep coming back.  Love it!

I walked down the street from my hotel on my way to a different restaurant and saw Pho, and decided to check it out. I love slightly dark,  understated very local looking spots and I couldn't resist. Man what a great call!! I walk in and my ears are hit with the melodious sounds of a saxophone jamming out on stage to some funky blues. Who would've guessed?!  I parked myself at a booth in front of the stage, had a Tsing Tao beer, and ordered some specials off the back page of the menu. The spicy spring rolls with pork were crispy fresh, and the hot clay pot of caramelized salmon hit the spot. When I was done, I couldn't leave for over an hour because the blues were just too damn good and my stomach was too happy.   If you're in town on a Tuesday for the blues jam or any other night of the week craving some bomb Vietnamese food, hit this place up!

I have walked past LGO a dozen times because I thought it was just a coffee and snack place.  As it turns out, they have an impressive selection of fresh, green, and healthy creations ready for takeout for the hurried business traveler.  And for those in less of a hurry you've got sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and more cooked to order. I had the spicy chick pea lettuce wraps - I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but to my great surprise this dish not only tasted good, but actually filled me up too.    The layout of the joint was a bit confusing and the general flow of foot traffic needs improvement. I'll swing by for another bite next time I'm in this wing of the airport, especially considering the only other food option here is the less-than-average Mexican restaurant next door.

The two times I have stopped by have been rushed, which isn't unusual in an airport if you've got a flight to catch.  Both times I sat at the bar hoping for fast service, but in each instance I was forgotten for about five minutes after receiving a menu :(  The servers behind the bar when I was there (I recognize that there is a lot of rotation in an airport establishment) didn't do a very good job of scanning over their patrons to make sure everyone was taken care of. There seemed to be a tunnel vision thing going on, not much multi-tasking.   Obviously it's a tough job to keep up with such a high customer turnover rate, but I've visited busier upscale airport restaurants here at PHX that do a great job and set the bar high. I'll update my review the next time I stop by hoping for a different experience.

This is the second time I've visited when they were out of the wine I requested. Both times I was offered the more expensive label of the same grape as an alternative. A kind gesture one might say!  Until you see that they charged the higher amount on your bill. If it were my restaurant, I would only charge for the less expensive wine as a way to say "I'm sorry we were out of your wine."  Also, the minestrone soup cup is tiny.  Please offer a bowl.

Nothing irritates me more than gas stations with no public restroom.  I KNOW YOU HAVE ONE IN HERE SOMEWHERE!!!!  It's not like the employees use the wall behind the store right?  Oh wait, that's exactly what the guy at the desk told me when I asked. I figured, well fine then, to the alley behind the store I go.    Big mistake. Tripped on a jacked up corner of the curb and almost fell right onto a couple of bums who then proceeded to ask me for bus change.  No thanks, I will take my bladder elsewhere.

Come on Drai's!!  You are killing me with this music. I'm partying at you right now as we speak, fingers crossed praying for some deep or tech house. Wait. Am I really at drai's??  All I hear is hip hop.... I must be hallucinating. Maybe I teleported to Pure?!  It's a living nightmare. Homies humping leg left and right. Wait... Wait... Now it's a slow song!!  Hey Drake thank you for putting us all to sleep. If the DJ's goal was to clear this place out he is succeeding with valor. I WANT TO PARTY AND CAPTAIN LAME RAP ISN'T LETTING ME!!!!!

Great vibe, friendly helpful staff, funky throwback details in the rooms, bright colors, nice pool and spa, delicious restaurant Distrito on the property, valet parking included, phenomenal fitness center, perfect Old Town location, the list goes on and on! No complaints, I will continue to stay here on business trips for the foreseeable future.
