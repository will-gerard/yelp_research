I'm not big on chain restaurants but gave this one another try mostly because I was taking a friend and her daughter out for her birthday.   3 people - no alcoholic drinks nearly $80 with the tip, how ridiculous.   Mediocre service, which had to be hunted down several times for water and soft drink refills, they didn't even give my friend anything for her birthday.   Best part is when we were ready to leave, we were told we would have to wait because their systems were down and they couldn't close anyones bill out - so 20 minutes and no apologies or discount later, we got our check.  It will be my last time at any Cheesecake Factory, they can take their overpriced crap and keep it.

Best Italian food in town.  Always great and entertaining service from Donna who has the ability to remember a customers preferences time and time again. The chicken dishes are all very good but the pizza dough and calzones are truly the best you can find West of New York.  I can't justify going to another Italian restaurant in town because of the quality of the food. Also - as it is a BYOB, you save a little money on drinks.  Simply the best of Phoenix.

Marina and her team are always very pleasant with me.  She always keeps me entertained with stories and more importantly, does a great job on mani and pedi.   As a male client, I've often felt uncomfortable, awkward or treated poorly at other salons but here I feel very comfortable and relaxed.  I'm really glad I found this place as it is - refreshingly-  not like most of the other salons in the valley.   I also like the fact the salon is very clean.

Marina - who does manicures, pedicures and waxing is the best.  She makes you always feel comfortable and relaxed.  As a male client it is important that I feel that way and she is absolutely wonderful.

I am very glad this place is close by and delivers good Chinese food.  Most of the Asian restaurants in N Scottsdale are chains and they suck so it's nice to have a local.  They even do Singapore Noodles which is one of my favorites and they do it well.  I wish they didn't upcharge for brown rice though.   It's a regular event for me especially if I feel like staying in and just having some comfort Chinese.

This is one of my favorite places in the Valley.  True French atmosphere and a nice bright courtyard.  I've always had great service and food.  I mostly go for lunch as it can get $$$$ but if you get what you pay for, this place certainly provides excellent quality.

Even though its right around the corner, this is the first time I've been here and I would definitely come back. I like the cozy bar in the front which had a city feel to it - reminded me of places in San Francisco.   The food was outstanding Tuscan style and they actually have Calamari that is steamed not fried.  I had the Chicken with mushrooms in a light broth and my dining companion had the Salmon, we both cleaned our plates. Very good service.

Joined on a groupon, went once and never went back.  Gym equipment was so old it brought back memories of the 70s.   Tennis courts filled with rug rats and people who did not want to give way to anyone else wanting to hit.  Heated pool, big deal can crash a local resort hotel for that.  My expectations were not met, very disappointed.

Great food and prices.  Servings are generous and the atmosphere is good.  A nice place for traditional Mexican in Old Town.  Really liked the Pollo Relleno.

Very fun place, especially for al fresco dining.   Good service and food.  A little pricey so couldn't afford to go for lunch daily but certainly every so often. Have always enjoyed the food and they are good with soft drink refills.  Gets a little more "pick up joint" at night so I usually stick with lunch.    They have also done some theme dinners where they pair wine and serve a mutli-course chefs choice menu, the one's I've gone to have been outstanding and well worth the price.

Nice restaurant, went there during a restaurant promotion, really enjoyed my pasta and everyone in my party liked their choices.  Nice al fresco dining also if you book ahead you can secure a spot on the terrace.

I've been eating or getting takeout from this place for many years.  I've always been satisfied with the orders, lots of flavor.  The service has always been good.  I especially like the Shaken Beef, Lemongrass Chicken and the Chicken Pho.  Also the Spring rolls are good and they are not stingy with the shrimp in them.  I'm glad they are 5 minutes away.  It is also nice to support a family owned restaurant.  If someone wants to go for dinner last minute during busy season, this is a good standby as they will always have a table to accommodate you.

I really like this place.  Generous portions, good service, always keep my water or ice tea glass filled.  If I lived any closer I'd be there once a week for sure.

One of my top places in the Valley.  Great food and drinks - try the sangria.  Good service and a really nice ambience in the place.  Mixed crowd which always seems to get along well.  A communal dining area, nice for singles or small parties.  The cookie dessert is very decadent.   Open and serving late too which is a plus since most every decent eatery shuts down by 9 or 10 in this town.

This location is like the best kept secret.  Although the area is a bit ghetto, this gym is in great condition, clean, patrons who have gym etiquette and a solid range of equipment.  Whenever I need to be on this side of town, I pack a gym bag. If I were to give any criticism it would be that there's not a lot of natural light/windows towards the back of weight room area but otherwise, this place is excellent.

I like this club, never have to wait for cardio or most machines and benches.   Front desk staff always very friendly.  Most of the patrons have decent gym etiquette although sometimes old men in the locker room can be gross.  Seems like there are too many machines, many I never see anyone use, get rid of them and make more room or add a few of the highly used machines.   Not overly impressed with the trainers just by observation, seem to walk around with clipboards a lot.  Restrooms kept clean and overall gym floor in good shape.  Don't expect valet parking but its a very nice gym for Scottsdale.

Great place, I like the lunch menu although it's pricey so can't go every day.  I've mostly had the salads and they are always fresh and flavorful.  Service is very attentive, keeping water and beverage glasses full.  Different people come around to check on your satisfaction. Excellent place for a business lunch.

One of the hip spots in town, I really enjoy the vibe.  Happy Hour and regular prices are very appealing.  Have never ordered anything I didn't like and the service is usually fun and friendly.  The enclosed outdoor patio makes it comfy year round.  Crowd is an eclectic mixture of yuppies. guppies, and cougars.  Makes for great people watching, especially after a few drinks.  Like the comp valet parking so you don't have to deal with the limited spaces available.

Wanted to see what all of the hype was about so I ordered online for pick up.  Arrived to an unorganized place with staff not very engaged in what they were doing after waiting for eye contact at the pickup counter, it was learned that my order was lost and so I got to wait 20 minutes for my order.  Staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers. Got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.  Burgers were okay not great kind of thin, in and Out and Carls Jr better for sure.  I will not be back.

I came home from a long weekend in mid-Summer to find my AC wasn't working.  Ron was over the next morning, had even spoken to me in the late evening to troubleshoot when I first got home.  He identified and resolved the problem quickly and the cost was extremely reasonable.  I was impressed with his knowledge, professionalism and honesty.  I am so glad I have found a reliable AC firm whenever I have any issues in the future.

This place has fast become a favorite of mine.  They have a great Happy Hour, with $5 small plates that are very generously portioned.  The presentation of everything here is impressive and service is consistently excellent.  The flatbreads are very popular and provide some great combinations, I like the steak and blue cheese flatbread which is easily a meal. Save room for dessert, the mini desserts they present and explain are amazing, every one my guests or I have tried has been scrumptious. I look forward to my next dinner there.

I really like this place.  The service is always really good.  The food is consistent and decent.   It's not as pretentious as some of the other restaurants in Scottsdale Quarter.  I understand they are looking to add some new drink specials which I look forward to checking out.

I can't believe it's been here for 5 years and I didn't know about it until I saw some friends "check in" there.   What a find, great service, food and prices.  I had the flat rice noodles with shrimp and my dining buddy had the Lok Lak, we shared both dishes.  They were tasty - similar to Vietnamese but slightly different spices.  Service www very good and we finalized off with a Coconut tapioca dessert.  It's a BYO so you can also save a bit on expensive drinks.  I can't wait to return and try more of the menu.

I absolutely love this place, the food, the service.  Everyone is friendly.  Bartender remembered my drink upon my second visit without me asking.  I always meet friendly visitors and locals there and everyone is welcome.   Try the sweet potato tater tots and ask for all of the dipping sauces.  They also cook their burgers to order - not over like a lot of places here and the quality of the meat is very good.  It's my Sunday funday place.

Great brunch.  Enjoyed the service, bottomless mimosas, friendly crowd and dog friendly patio.  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and they food choices were very good and there were interesting selections.  My friend got a hummus platter which was really good while I stuck with the Florentine Benedict and Hangover Fries - both really good, the hangover fries can be a meal in itself.  Although it's not close to me, I will definitely plan to return and maybe bring my Scottish Deerhound along.

Love this place, great decor, food - while not traditional Mexican, is very tasty and reasonably priced as are the drinks.  We stopped in the first time just for drinks and they kindly gave us chips and salsa and kept giving us more and the service was very attentive. Close to the light rail grid for easy transport. I feel like I am on vacation even though I live here so they have succeeded in my mind!

What could be better than Mexican Asian fusion and a great Happy Hour?  The food selections were quite interesting and very good, very attentive staff, cool atmosphere.  Complimentary valet parking if you desire.  I liked the Korean tacos with kimchee and pretty much everything I sampled.  Some good options for vegetarians too.   I'll be back for sure.

I love Malaysian food so I was excited to find this place was close to an area I needed to be in.  The service was exemplary, they really took time to explain things in the menu and how they are prepared.  We tried the fried rice and a noodle dish both of which were generously portioned and had the ice kacang for dessert which was a real treat and truly a different and authentic Malaysian offering. The atmosphere was relaxed and a great place for an inexpensive yet exotic meal.  Also very clean. Another place I will be looking forward to going back to.
