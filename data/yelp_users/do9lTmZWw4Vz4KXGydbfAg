Going to give this 5 stars even though it is the second day they are open.  Here is why:  To start the food was great, I had the Fish & Chips, the fish is Cod in a beer batter with coleslaw and fries.  I even liked the slaw, it had the right mix of vinegar and mayo.  TJ had had the wood fire pizza.  While the crust was a bot thick, the pizza was awesome.  To top it off our waitress was very friendly and prompt.  The over the top thing was when they offered to store the extra pizza until we came out of the movies.....how cool is that!!!

Great brewery!!!!  The beer is awesome and the food is really good.  I was able to try every beer they had and they were all great.  Had the Arizona Trail Burger and it was great as well, I asked for medium and I got medium.

The Iguana Macks has upgraded a bit and changed its name.  This includes a new menu.  Had the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Bisque Soup.  The sandwich was great, the soup, not so much! The soup was orange in color and tasted nothing like tomato. When I inquired about the soup I was told that is normal.  My advice is to avoid the tomato soup. The staff was friendly and courteous, but slow.  The real kicker was when they decided not to honor the frequent lunch card they had just handed out a few weeks ago. Goodbye Iguana Macks....Social Box I won't be back!!!
