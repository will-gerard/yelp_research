A Phoenix native told me I had to try the mexican food while I was in town, so I stopped by La Tolteca and I was happy I did.  I tired out a torta and a couple of sopas.  The al pastor sopa was right on as was the the carne asada.  My milanesa torta was a bit chewy but otherwise prepared with great fresh veggies.  Hit up the salsa bar for some extra flavor!  Enjoy!

Exceptional Italian sandwiches like no other you have ever tried. I cannot compare to anything from Italy as I have never traveled there, but I am sold on the authenticity at Pane Bianco.   The menu is limited but it allows them to knock it out of the park on what they do offer. The flat bread is made right there in the oven central to the shop, and tastes great, there seems to be a pinch of salt tossed on at the very end that gives the bread a great finish.   The sandwich I enjoyed was filled with sopressata and mozzarella which ranked with the best I have ever had.   All around an extremely worth while stop for anyone who loves Italian deli food, Do not pass on the candy that comes with the meal!

Very good sandwich shop for lunch! I had tracked Cheese 'n Stuff down but initially had to wait due to their lunch oriented hours. When we got a chance the other day to finally try their sandos out I was pretty happy.   I am always a fan of Boar's Head products so C'nS is already headed in the right direction for me. The bread for my Italian Sub was a great fresh, soft roll which had nicely absorbed some of the dressing rounding out a nice sandwich. I have a task ahead working through their sandwich list but expect many great encounters along the way.   Great family owned spot.

Now this is a damn fine sausage shop! Myself and a few coworkers grabbed brown bag lunches which for $5 bucks are a great deal. Between use we tried the bratwurst, sweet Italian and beerhot which all got two thumbs up. In addition to these items I will be headed back to try out as many of the other sausage in the case as possible. Items which caught my eye were the bockwurst, wieners, knockwurst the size of a small baby and what may be the greatest butcher invention ever, the sausage kabob!   In addition to the great sausage and meat selection Schreiner's also has a nice selection of German provisions in the form of the wall of fermented and pickled wonders.   It may take me a few weeks but I am going to try everything they have to offer, I suggest you do the same.    Heads up; cash, debit or check only....no credit cards

A Trader Joe's with a good parking lot, what a gold mine!  All the great things about Trader Joe's are to be found here.  The gym next door helps bring in some good looking customers.

Pizzeria Bianco delivers on a great handmade, wood fired, traditional pizza.  Its touch to dethrone my personal LA favorite pizza from Mozza but Bianco is right there at the line!   I had been warned about the long waits, and seen them first hand in the evenings walking home from the stadium, so I slipped in right at 11 for the start of lunch.  I got a table right away and was able to enjoy a great meal without feeling rushed in any way, I would definitely suggest trying for weekday lunch if you want to miss the crowds.  The pizza was really good with the great wood fired flavor that you can only experience in a few spots such as Bianco and Mozza.  The dough and crust were perfect, I was really impressed with the crust that took on a great caramelized taste right around the edges.  Don't run from what you think may be burnt spots, embrace the caramelized doughy bliss.  I sampled the Margherita which I consider the ultimate pizza to judge a spot by, and the Wiseguy because it sounded great and I could not pass up house smoked mozzarella.  The Margherita passed the test with flying colors, the basil had a great aromatic presence that perfectly complimented the great tomato sauce.  The Wiseguy was impressive and the smoked mozzarella complimented the wood fired greatness of the pizza as a whole.  Well done Pizzeria Bianco, if Phoenix were my hometown then you would be my top craft pizza spot in the States

Very impressive venue.  Note that this review comes from a casual admirer of baseball:  Chase Field is cool!  the stadium is located right in downtown Phoenix with great public transit service.    Once you are inside you have great access to everywhere it seems.  I am accustomed to LA where you are restricted to your level and can't move around much.  Chase allows you to walk completely around the base level which gets you great views of all of the action.  The lower level is also where most of the food selections reside, take your time scoping out your favorite ballpark dog and beer while taking in the game.  Another great feature of Chase Field with its proximity to downtown is the choices surrounding the stadium before and after the game, you defiantly can make a great trip out of a game here.

Very good traditional breakfast spot. I stopped in just as they opened during the week to make sure and grab a spot.  I was treated with a really tasty plate of eggs and peppered bacon.  One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.  The real show stealer is the toast and home made jam.  Nicely done breakfast at Matt's, go grab some!

It's gets the job done. The "Deluxe" bit might be a bit of a stretch as the facility appears to have had better days. This will never be confused with a main stream or premium range hotel but I am not sure anyone would be surprised by that. I would not stay here with the family for a vacation but for a bed and a shower while working out of town it suffices.

The wheels completely fell of this place!  After enduring a number of weeks here for work I finally gave up living in the slum and moved to a much better location right around the corner.    One to many mornings with a cold shower, cigarette burnt bedding, mystery stained towels, and horrible smells in the hallways.

Killer sandwiches and dill potato salad that set my world on end.  I wish I had known of Bertha's while I was in town for a long period of time because I would have eaten here everyday.    I went for the blue cheese roast beef sandwich which was a magical meal.  Lightly toasted bread, slightly sweet mustard mayo, fresh veggies and the most beautiful sliced roast beef I have seen in a long time, this sandwich was nothing short of awesome, damn it was good.    As a side I got the dill potato salad, this stuff is NOT your grandmothers potato salad, this is what your grandmother should have been giving you.  Holy wow, creamy dill potato greatness.  I am going to have to figure out how to get this out to me in LA.  The deserts looked great and the little chocolate brownie cookie gave me an idea of how good the other offerings most likely are.  Bertha's is awesome, fresh sando's, salads, wraps and potato salad that will redefine the potato.  Bertha's please open a location in LA, I will keep you afloat!

The sliders are awesome and I beat the Chompies challenge!...........not really.  I say this because Tuesday is the day to head over to Chompies and eat your heart to death with all you can eat sliders.  While I didn't eat the dozen sliders and beat the challenge, I did beat the price tag by going the all can eat route.  Back to the real point here, the food.  The sliders were pretty damn close to perfection.  The bread was magically soft, the brisket nicely cooked to a tender and flavorful point that melts in your mouth, the potato pancake was just awesome with a crunch creamy change of pace to the texture and the sauce just dead on, not to much that the sliders were soggy.  Like I said, just about the perfect slider. The western were good also, but stick with the original.  Skip the $40 challenge, head over on Tuesday and gorge yourself to death on Chompies awesome original sliders!

All around really nice REI location. I was very impressed with this store during a recent out-of-town stop in. It seems to be a newer location and is very well organized and stocked. I was very impressed by the second floor water sports selection! Very polite and helpful staff, you can not go wrong with REI.

The best ice cream I have ever had!   I know have a reason to move to Phoenix/Scottsdale and the reason is Sweet Republic. The menu is like a all star list of ice cream and it took me a while to make a decision of what to try beyond the obvious everything. I went for a classic with the Madagascar Vanilla and a unique flavor with the Honey Blue Cheese to try to get an idea of Sweet Republic's range. WOW, they blew me away.   The honey blue cheese was an oddly wonderful taste that I enjoy in its normal incarnation but found the ice cream version to be somehow better! The flavors were well developed and not over powering, especially the blue cheese which could have been a bully and ruined everything. A subtly savory sweet treat!   The Madagascar vanilla was nothing short of perfect, the flavor was dead on, texture was perfect and best of all the silky creaminess worked together to develop my first official ice cream addiction needing intervention. The iconic ice cream flavor has a new high mark set with this one.   I will without hesitation go out of my way to stop in at Sweet Republic anytime I am in the state of Arizona. My only request (dream) is that they have a tasting menu. I would gladly hand over $10-20+ for a well rounded spoonful of each flavor available.   Out of this world Sweet Republic, thank you for delivering the best culinary experience during my stay in Arizona

I can't knock Fresh and Easy, I just can't into this place.  The selection is fine, its somewhere in between a special grocery store and a chain super market.  You can get in and out fast but I just have never been a fan of the prepared foods which is one of their big products.  The prepared foods always have seemed bland in terms of taste, I have never experienced a problem with freshness of the food but it is difficult to find much on the healthier side of the spectrum.  Some of the dishes are down right scary when you read the nutritional facts.  It will get the job done in a pinch but otherwise look for me at TJ's.

Same sandwich, different wrapper.  Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs, whatever, they are all the same

I have grabbed lunch here a few times now and really enjoy their wraps.  The Thai is a standout closely followed by buffalo chicken.  The ingredients are always incredibly fresh and taste profiles are very nice.  They also understand how mush sauce to put on an item to compliment it and not over due the whole meal.    The pasta salad is particularly amazing, and I would suggest it to everyone.
