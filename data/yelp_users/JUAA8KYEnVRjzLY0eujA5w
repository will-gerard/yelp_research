Total dive bar, but so awesome! Definitely a cool little hangout spot. Not to mention, best food ever! The onion rings are delicious and I always get the garlic patty melt....absolutely delicious!

This location is great!  This was my first visit to this location and it was perfect.  I'm extraordinarily picky about food, so I'm always asking for substitutions and things to be removed.  Darian and Brenda were more than accommodating.  I had some issues with my rewards, but they were able to get it all situated for me and I left very happy.  Great location!

This location is great. I've never been to a Firestone but when the time came to get the battery replaced in my car, I did a lot of research and Firestone has the best bang for my buck. Of course, the day I went to go get my battery replaced, my car wouldn't even start. I called this location, talked to Jeff, and he got my appointment all set up for the same morning. I got there early but Jeff got me taken care of right away. I was really impressed; All the guys were really nice and gave exceptional customer service. These guys were all great and I couldn't ask for a better experience. Thank you!

Love my new tint! I seriously feel like I'm driving a new car. The tint looks fantastic, the employees I dealt with were nice, and I left happy. What more can I ask for? I was told it would take about 2 1/2 hours for my tint, but I only waited for 30 min. I'll admit, they could really do some sprucing up on their waiting room. It's small, it's hot, and the tv got about 2 channels. Not to mention, they offer wifi for their customers, but the password given to me was incorrect. I'm glad I only had to wait half an hour cuz I definitely would've gone stir crazy with the lack of things to to in the waiting room.

Pretty terrible location. I've had the pleasure of visiting Ulta locations in multiple states and locations, so I usually know what to expect. My trip today was a joke. When I walked in the door, I got the generic welcome. I already knew what I needed, so I went to the makeup area and began looking for a specific color. I had about 4 employees walk by me and was never asked if there was something I needed or if I needed assistance choosing/finding anything. They were too busy standing in little groups, gossiping (I heard the conversations....definitely nothing relating to helping their customers or the store in general). Not to mention, the store was a bit of a mess (it's a couple days after Black Friday, so maybe they're still cleaning up), a lot of things were not stocked, and none of the employees seemed to care about any of the customers walking around. Just terrible overall.

I really love this restaurant. In regards to this location, I've never had a bad experience. My most recent time was just a casual dinner with a date. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps (always a delicious classic), asparagus, and we each ordered the kung pao shrimp. Everything was absolutely delicious. Only criticism I had was I ordered a mai tai and it was just way too strong. Of all the PF Changs I've been too, I really like this location. It's a little smaller than most locations (in my opinion), but never crowded or anything like that.

The reason I'm rating this location so high is because I absolutely love my doctor (Mark Schlotterback).  I can't say enough great things about him.  Unfortunately, I have to agree on many of the other reviews about having to wait.  The waiting room is never that long of a wait, but once I get into the exam room, I'm lucky if it's less than 30 min.  I have seen other doctors at this practice, but none of them compare to Dr. S. He's extremely knowledgeable and a great diagnostician.  I can't say enough great things about him.  So unfortunately, my review might be a tad biased because of how great I think my doctor is.

This is my go-to location.  It's in a very convenient location and a good location.  Very clean, the employees are always very nice, and there's always plenty of parking.  The primary reason I come here is to fill my prescriptions.  Most of the time when I go to the pharmacy, I used the drive up (a big plus to have).  Occasionally tho, I have to go inside to pickup my scripts, which I absolutely hate because I feel like there's always a snobby teenage girl working behind the counter that seems like she doesn't wanna be there, let alone help a customer.  Because of that, I just can't bring myself to give this place 5 stars.

OMG this place is delicious!  Now I know why people are always raving about chicken & waffles!  Granted, we went at the worst time possible (lunch time) and it was pretty busy, so we waited a good amount of time.  Our waiter's name was Jesse and he was fairly decent.  Unfortunately, we were seated outside and there were a few instances where I'm convinced Jesse forgot about us.  We easily sat out there with empty glasses for about 30 min at a time.  Granted, the amazing food made up for it.

It's weird to review a fast food place, but I just have to cuz I couldn't believe how terrible my service was. First of all, there was only 2 cars ahead of me, but I sat there for 15 min waiting. When I finally got up there, the cashier was obviously fighting with another employee, so this little scrawny kid goes and he literally yells "yeah, no shit bro! Don't come at me like that, you don't know who you're talking to." All while taking my card and giving me my food. At some point he remembered he was working and asked me if I wanted any sauce. Besides that, didn't give me a hello or goodbye, just kept fighting with this other employee. Wow....just wow.

I love this Bath & Body Works. I'm not totally thrilled about the location because there's a lot of trash that walks around there, but the actual store itself is pretty good. There's a very sweet employee there (I believe her name is Arialla) and she is always super helpful. This location is always stocked and never insanely crowded.

Pretty awesome. My insurance company sent them out when my car wouldn't start. I was literally on my way to get my battery replaced and of course my car wouldn't start. They got out there super quick (way before my insurance company quoted), they got my battery jump started in about 2 minutes, and I was on my way. The guy who did it was nice and super quick...can't complain about that!

For a Walmart in the valley, this location is pretty awesome. I never knew of this location till yesterday and I'm glad I found out about it. It's clean, well kept, and the employees are fairly decent. You also will see less trashy people walking around here than at the Arizona Ave location.

I've only gotten my nails done here once about a year ago....not bad, but I've had much better. This review is more so about the owner Mimi. She's amazing! I've been getting my lashes and brows done by her for the last 2 years and she's the only one I trust! She doesn't overcharge for eyelash extensions and my eyebrows always look amazing when I leave. Trust me, I've extremely picky about my eyebrows and she's the best. Granted, because she's the only aesthetician there, she usually has a long wait. I swear, the wait is worth it! A downside is that she doesn't really do appointments....unfortunately.

Not terrible! I ordered from this place because I saw a promotion that was suggested on Facebook. I decided to give it a try and it really wasn't bad. Better than dominoes or papa johns or any chain like those. I'm from Chicago, so I'm very critical of pizza. If I ever decide I just want a cheap, quick pizza, I will definitely go here again. I like the fact that they do the flavored crust. It's a very simple dry seasoning they'll put on the crust, so it's not incredibly overpowering or anything.

*****Update!***** Ok, so since I had such a decent experience the other night, I decided to give this place a try again. Big mistake. I made the order online and when I got to the store, they said it would be about 2 more minutes. I waited inside the store, browsed Facebook, checked my email, and then realized 15 min later that I was still waiting. Amongst this time, I hear one of the male workers saying "holy shit" 13 times (at some point, I started counting because I couldn't believe how unprofessional they were being, with a customer in the store nonetheless). Finally, a sweet girl comes to the counter and asks if I was waiting for a pizza. Uhhhh yeah, for the last 15 minutes! She pulls it out of the little warmer box! What was I waiting for??! To add insult to injury, the pizza tasted like hell this time. Wayyyyyy too much cheese and the crust was way thicker than the first time I ordered from here. I won't be coming back.

Alright, so this was my first visit here and to be completely honest, idk why the reviews are as high as they are. I usually get smoothies like this around the corner from China Magic Noodle House, but I decided I would go for a change and get something different, so I finally tried this place after reading all the reviews. I was originally going to get a milk tea when I got there, but I decided to get the watermelon slush so I can compare it to CMNH. When I tasted it, I was disappointed. It was very obviously that fake watermelon syrup flavoring and did not have any trace of real watermelon. It was seriously just sugar in a cup with a splash of watermelon flavoring. To make things worse, I also ordered calamari, for charged for it, and then had (I'm assuming) the manager come by and tell the cashier that they're not offering it right now. Instead of asking if I'd like something else or anything like that, they just grab some cash and give me my money back. Idk if he cashier was new or what his deal was but he was just being very fidgety, non attentive, and rude. I might give this place another shot in the future so I can finally try milk tea (like I should've done in ten first place) but this isn't a place I would ever come to on a regular basis.

So this is an update from my first visit...I was a tad harsh on them the first time around. I visited today to try the cantaloupe milk tea (which is what I originally was going to get the first time) and it was phenomenal. Not to mention, the employees were much nicer this time around and knew what they were doing. Moral of the story, try to visit this place on the weekend for good customer service lol

Super convenient location, in the heart of Tempe.  This place is fairly small, but big things come in small packages.  They have TONS to choose from.  I had a hard enough time choosing, but the employees are so cool, they were educating me on a lot of the different types of products I was shopping for.  I got even luckier because I found an online deal, so I was able to get a lot of bang for my buck.  I will definitely be back! Can't say enough great things about this place.

I rarely get my nails done anymore, but when I do, this is my go-to place. I've been coming here for a long time and even tho they're slightly (and I mean very slightly) higher priced than most nail salons, you get what you pay for. The girls will always go above and beyond to make sure your nails look fabulous. I personally go to Rachel...I'm super picky and she's always satisfied my high maintenance ways (with my nails anyway). Seriously, I can't say enough great things about this place.

This location is pretty terrible. I had time to kill yesterday so after my Starbucks run (right next door) I stopped here and decided to get some breakfast. It wasn't terribly busy, but there was a pretty decent number of people there for 8:30am on a Wednesday. I went to the first person, put in my order, then walked down to the next person who read off my order and it was completely incorrect. When I told her it was incorrect, she rolled her eyes and started huffing & puffing (this was after the same thing happened with the couple in front of me as well). She said she had to get a manager in order to fix the order, but I told her to just leave the order as is because I didn't wanna back up the line. After paying, I stood there for about 15 min waiting for my breakfast bagel. If you ask me, that's a bit long. Needless to say, the communication between the employees at this location is absolutely terrible. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but none of them actually seem to be doing anything. The owner & managers really need to get it together and make this place run more efficiently.

Very good place. I ordered the hummus and a gyro pita-- both of which were very good. I made my order to-go so I didn't get to sit down and observe the service or anything, but I can say this place is very very cute. Great little lunch spot. Only thing that kinda bugged me was that I had a coupon for a discount on an appetizer and the girl wouldn't honor it because I had a take-out order. But whatever, it wasn't that big of a deal. I'll probably be back if I ever get a craving for some decent Greek food.

I've been to a lot of Yogi's locations...most of them in the east valley. But now that I've moved to Phoenix, I've had to adjust and try this location. Big mistake. This is seriously the worst location I've ever been to. It was dirty, the food took forever to make (I had a to-go order), and the food actually made me sick when I got home. I'm super bummed out because this is one of my favorite restaurants, but I won't be returning to this location.

This location is my go-to location. It's super close and convenient for me. I've never had any issues when I come here. They are very consistent with the food. My favorites from the menu are the beef teriyaki bowl, the shrimp tempura udon soup, the crunch roll (absolutely amazing), and the edamame. I'm a very picky eater and I like that Yogi's doesn't do all the unnecessary add ins in their food. So delicious! Only criticism I have for this location is that the employee on the register always seems to have a little bit of an attitude or something. This isn't a typical "restaurant" setting, so it doesn't bother me that much, but it's a tad annoying.

I couldn't say enough prayers...holy mother of god! The other reviews are spot-on. I just moved to the general area and figured this place couldn't really be that bad. This place is beyond ghetto and disgusting. There's about a million employees, most of which are standing around, doing absolutely nothing. I just can't believe the trash that's around here (the people). I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Never again. I'll pay the slight extra and shop at Safeway or Target.

This is my favorite restaurant. I have always visited the location in Gilbert, but this Scottsdale location is definitely awesome. The surrounding area has tons of shopping and it's a gorgeous area. My personal fav food here is the lobster bisque; I never come here without getting it! The bellinis are also delicious! You won't ever get a Bellini anywhere else. Seriously, I've never had a complaint anytime I've come here.

So I lived at this apartment complex for 2 years without too many issues. There was the occasional trashy people that would move in and constantly steal my parking spot and the occasional fights out on the lawns where I've had to call the police, but that happens at all places, right? Probably not. Don't be fooled by the model they show you. The model has all hardwood floors and obviously everything is clean. My apartment had gross, brown carpeting everywhere except the closet/bathroom. Regardless, moving is a pain and I love chandler, so I decided these little battles were small enough not to leave. Well, one weekend I went out of town for 2 days and when I got back, my apartment was INFESTED with roaches. I couldn't believe how bad it was. I was afraid to sleep in my own apartment! Since the exterminator is only there on Fridays, I had to call my own exterminator because it was a Monday and the problem needed to be resolved ASAP! In the meantime, I packed up my little dog, packed a bag, and moved into a hotel. All the while, emailing the corporate PBBell office. They agreed to have their exterminator come in and fix the problem the next day. I was literally fighting back & forth with management about proper compensation for what I had been going through and the endless money I've spent on the issue....they didn't agree with me and I got a letter from their attorney. Classy, right? Despite the fact that I told them I had tons of video and picture proof of what I had been going through, they still fought with me about the situation. Forget that! I terminated my lease early and am now in luxury apartments in Phoenix. I was a great renter, but apparently that means nothing to this complex. Quite unfortunate. Save your deposits and move somewhere else. These places are old and the roaches are living in the walls and coming in through the electric sockets and causing infestations. Please, enjoy my pictures and videos. Including a picture of the dead cockroach in the studio model home.

My new favorite froyo spot! They have some pretty awesome flavors and the best toppings. On top of that, the employees are always super nice and have a smile on their faces. I think what I love most is that it's so close to Mill Ave. After a couple hours of drinking with friends, you can stop here for some amazing frozen yogurt :)

Not good....not horrible. My first problem was the front desk...nobody there when I needed to check in and then again when I was having an issue with my key. Once I was speaking to someone, she was loud and yelling to the person in the back room, instead of being professional and walking back there. My other issue is being an establishment that allows pets, but makes you pay, despite the fact that it's a service animal? Come on. The actual room was decent....the appliances are very old but luckily I wasn't staying very long. On top of that, my bedding was filthy (as you can see from my pictures). Also, my AC was driving me crazy....I took a video of how loud it was when it would kick on every couple of minutes...so loud!

They usually have exactly what I need here, so it had nothing to do with the products, but the reason I didn't give this location 5 stars is because of the employees. Just ridiculous. There's been times where I'll go in and some young girl behind the counter will have the worst attitude (she even stayed behind the counter doing her eyebrows even after I asked her a question). Then today, I'm standing in the store for 10 min, waiting for someone to ring me out; there was NOBODY on the floor- I looked. Retail 101, if employees aren't on the floor, you run the risk of having product stolen. Just pathetic. Regardless (and unfortunately for me), I'll only shop at Pet Club for my dog's needs. Usually the location on Ray & Dobson tho.

This place is so good. I've tried a few items off the menu and I have yet to have something I didn't like. There were some complaints about the fried dumplings not being good, but idk what people are talking about! First of all, they're huge dumplings, so you get enough bang for your buck. Seriously, they're very good. If you go, you have to have their noodle dishes. My favorite noodle dish is the minced pork....so good! Also, idk why, but every time I go, I have to get the chicken teriyaki on a stick. So simple, yet so so good. I also always get one of their smoothies, usually with the tapioca or the coconut jello. Great place! You won't be disappointed.

Very delicious paletas. The first time I came here I got the pineapple chile one and it was extremely good. Perfect amount of sweetness with the spicy bite at the end. Only downside was that there were the hard chunks of pineapple in there that I had to keep spitting out. The second time I came here, I got the strawberry cream one. Once again, it was absolutely delicious! I can't wait for the mangos to get back in season so they can bring back the mango chile ones. I can't really get passed paying $3 for one paleta, but oh well...they're handmade and you get what you pay for.

Idk how this is considered a 3.5 star hotel. Even when I went to check in, there was nobody at the front desk and I had to wait for an extended period of time. When I got to my room, it was hot & stuffy. Even when I turned the thermostat to 65 degrees, it still wasn't comfortable. All these people are talking about the sleep number bed, which I absolutely hated. I felt like I was sleeping on an air mattress. To top it all off, I felt like my shower was just unclean. You can see the pic of the dirty grout in the tub and it was just not pleasant. The upside to this place was that I had a fridge that worked and a lot of clean towels....that's about it. Pretty unfortunate experience.

I really love this place. I won't eat regular cupcakes from the store anymore cuz this place really has the best ones. Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I feel like every time I go in because I have a craving for a certain flavor, they never gave the one I want. Regardless, I'll still get a different one. But still lol

Ok, I can't believe I'm doing this, but yes- I'm giving this MVD location 5 stars. I seriously planned on spending atleast 3 hours here to get my new license and I blocked my entire morning to be here. I got there at 8:28am and got back in my car by 9.  I was pretty shocked. All I needed to do was transfer my IL drivers license and get a new AZ license, change my address, and get a duplicate of my plate stickers (never got them in the mail because I still had an old address on file). Granted, the woman working the very front desk when I first walked in was totally rude and I wanted to hit her, but luckily the rest of he experience made up for it. The woman who actually helped me was super fast & efficient, sent me to the window to get my license pic, and I now have my (temporary) AZ drivers license! I'm from Chicago, so I'm used to DMVs that are complete nightmares. I was pretty shocked that it took me 4 times longer to get ready, than the time I actually spend at this MVD (not even joking- needed to look good for my license picture). Great job on running this location so efficiently! Keep up the great work!

This is the only place I'll take my fur baby. I've been to a few different grooming locations, but I always love this one. They don't overcharge, the girls are so sweet, and my princess always leaves wagging her tail and smiling. Traci is always who I ask for...my dog loves her and she's so patient with my dog (who is a rescue and a little weary of people). Can't say enough great things about them!

Amazing customer service. I had a major issue going on with my car (the doors weren't closing....yeah, scary). I spoke to John (fleet service dpt) and he told me to come in asap, he got my a loaner, and made everything super easy for me. Everything was covered under my warranty, which made things even better, but they went above and beyond my expectations. Not only did they get the doors fixed, but they also noticed my transmission was going out, so they fixed that too. Can't say enough great things about this place. There's a reason why they have the best ratings out of all the other ford dealerships in the valley....they're great!

Alright, I'm going to be completely honest here. The second I walked in the door of this establishment, I told myself I was going to give this place the Yelp review from hell. I didn't like that the guy at the front desk seemed to rush me, told me to pick a color (I told him I wanted to gel, but this place doesn't display their gel polishes on the wall) so I was confused when I didn't know what colors to look for. They finally showed me baskets with the pre-painted nails (which I was not fond of). But, after Nick (I believe that was his name) started doing my nails, he completely changed my mind. He took his time and completely salvaged my nails after they had been destroyed by a previous salon I went to in Springfield IL (I'm sure you can find the review I gave that place). Nick completely listened to my requests, made sure every nail was perfect, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I totally stumbled on this place while I was driving home and I'm so glad I did. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I've found my new nail place! I usually go to Pink Polish and I absolutely love them, but Delightful Nails is so much more convenient and I feel like it's so much more of a customer driven location. They want to make sure you leave happy and they're not always trying to tack on more add ons to your nails or anything like that. Seriously, can't get over how much I love this place and my new nail guys, Nick. (I almost feel like I'm cheating on Pink Polish lol)

Very typical Chipotle location. Good food, but my one concern is the employees. They always seem to be in a rush and don't seem too concerned work customer service. Not to mention, there's always so many of them standing on the line, which causes confusion and a backup in the line. Other than that, this location is fairly consistent with other Chipotles.

Yay for Yogurtini! Usually when I walk into a frozen yogurt place, I glance at the flavors and decide what I want. Here, I glanced at the flavors and HAD to try several of them! Then I couldn't decide- they were all so good! I ultimately decided on the pomegranate raspberry sorbet (it was so sweet and delicious). This is probably the best froyo place I've ever been to!

I love TJ Maxx....it's seriously one of my favorite stores. I walked in for ONE candle I really wanted, but I couldn't find it, so I found about a zillion other things I wanted instead. The only thing about this location that I'm not crazy about is that it's setup a little backwards compared to every other TJ maxx location I've ever been to. Other than that, the shelves were stocked, the store was clean, and there were plenty of employees at the registers!

Yum! I'm from Chicago, so I have gone to Potbellys for YEARS....even before they were this big sandwich chain. I love that this location keeps things consistent and the food is great. I love going here. I especially love that this location is open an hour later than most other locations. The employees are always nice and this is definitely one of my regular spots now that I've made the move to Phoenix.

Not impressed. At all. I ordered a ham & swiss bagel sandwich, with no egg, on an Asiago bagel. My sandwich looked goofy, the cheese wasn't melted, and the bagel itself tasted dry. To top it all off, the employees are incredibly rude. I've been to other Einstein locations and I've never been impressed by the customer service. But this time, was even worse. Patty was the cashier and she had a horrible attitude, like she didn't want to be there. A friend of mine asked if she could buy tea bags (they're on display in front) because she is always looking for a good chamomile tea to relax her and she though they looked fairly good. Patty looked at my friend as if she had killed her puppy. She rolled her eyes, said no- that she could only sell hot tea in the cup and not the individual bags. Whether or not that's true is not the issue; the issue is how rude and condescending Patty was upon presenting the information. She was muttering under her breath and rolling her eyes at my friend! So rude and unnecessary. Einstein bagels needs some new management and trainers ASAP, because the employees obviously don't want their jobs.

My little piece of home :) I'm originally from Chicago, so ofcourse Portillos is a household name. I've tried several things from the menu, with little faith in mind, but after trying my favorite menu items, I can honestly say, Portillos has done very well bringing this location to Scottsdale. From the food to the customer service, it's all comparable to the locations in Chicago.

My nails were completely falling apart from the previous location I went to. The acrylic was lifting so badly on the tips and the base of my nails, I just decided it was time to say goodbye to the acrylic. With it being summer, I decided to keep it light, so after doing my Yelp research and checking PLN, I decided I needed to make my appointment with Renee. I absolutely love what she did. She took her time getting the acrylic off and my manicure was great. I have no complaints :)

Idk why people are hating so much on this location. This is the most convenient location for me in terms of distance, but I've never had a problem here. Granted, if you're gonna go between 5:00-7:00, you're gonna hit a little bit of a line (typical dinner rush). But even when you get your order, I've never noticed them skimp on the proteins or anything else like some people are claiming. Whenever I come here, the employees are always very nice, accommodate/humor me when I ask for extra rice, lettuce, whatever it may be. This will definitely always be my Chipotle location of choice.

I actually like this location, for the most part. The employees are very friendly- especially the girl with the cute bobbed hair who works up front (she's always very personable and knows her regulars very well). The one complaint I have about this location is the fact that it's so small, makes it a little difficult to be efficient, especially first thing in the morning when they're so busy. Everybody is crammed up front, waiting for their drinks, so it makes it difficult for the customers who are walking in to order their drinks). Luckily, the employees are pretty fast & efficient, so I never have to wait too long, even first thing in the morning.

Just visited today and I had a great experience. Based on the convenience of this location, I always go to this location at Chandler Fashion. The employees are always very helpful (especially now during the busy holiday season), the shelves are always stocked, and the store is very clean & well kept. The person at the register was very sweet and made sure to give me my coupon, even though I had just used one. I can't say enough great thing. Keep up the good work!

My new favorite doctor.  I made an appointment, but I was running about 10 min late.  The girls at the front desk were still super nice & accommodating.  This was my first visit to a MMJ doctor and I was getting a brand new card, so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I'm so glad I chose this place.  As I mentioned, the girls who work up front (I spoke to Breanna a lot and I believe Nicole was the other one) are great.  After filling out about 5 pages of simple forms, I paid the state fee & the doctor evaluation fee, got my picture taken for my card, and saw Dr. Jordan.  He was very nice, understood exactly what I needed, did an evaluation, and sent me on my way!  The entire process took about 30-45 minutes.  I was very impressed.  Needless to say, I will be back in a year for my renewal.  Awesome awesome awesome!

Yum! I really love this pizza. I'm from Chicago, so I like to consider myself something of a pizza snob. Granted, it doesn't quite measure up to the real Chicago pizza, but it comes pretty close. I love that they have Italian beef as a topping! Seriously, so good!

This place is bomb dot com! I just moved to the general area and a friend of mine recommended this place to me. I'm glad he did! I'll be honest, I tried the carne asada quesadilla and I just wasn't impressed. Kinda reminded me of when I was back in college and would get a quesadilla from the cafeteria. But the burrito! Whoa! It was absolutely delicious! Such simple ingredients, but the flavor is over the top! I've definitely found a new favorite spot.

I'm a bit torn about how to review this place. Today was the first time I visited the establishment and the only reason I went was because a friend of mine told me they did psychic readings there. I was super intrigued so made a call this morning to meet with Gail, who was out of town, therefore not available until Saturday. Because of my work schedule, I decided I would meet with someone else (I believe her name was Lisa) who happens to be a "medium." In hopes of connecting with my ex (who also was my best friend) who passed away a few months ago, I agreed to meet with this other person and went in with an open mind. She started by asking me what I do for a living (I work for a bank). She starts laying out her tarot cards and I felt like she just started making things up. She starts talking about my specific branch and the funds that are kept in reserve, etc. First off, I work for the corporate office....not a branch. So that was strike 1. I asked her to move on to the medium part of the reading and she starts telling me about how my grandparents are coming through and they're ok, blah blah blah. Both sets of my grandparents are still alive....so that was strike 2. She then asks me who I wanted to connect with on the other side. I gave her my ex's first name (and only his name...I didn't even tell her that he was my ex or best friend) and she starts telling me that he says a romantic life with him wasn't possible because of something personal like his sexual orientation. My ex and I were together for many years and I can tell you, he was as straight as an arrow and we had no issues with our romantic life (even after we broke up). That was strike 3. I told her I was ready to end the reading early and that was the end of it. I told the girl at the front desk that it was the worst reading I ever had. Because of the girl who worked the front desk/answered phones, I'm not giving this place 1 star. She saved you with how awesome and nice she was. The store was pretty fantastic too (lots of incense and cool books). But the reading was so terrible, I will never attempt another reading there again.

So after my first visit (which was less than ideal), the owner Beth reached out to me to make things right. I called today and made an appointment for the same day and requested StacyLynn. Because she was a different psychic than what Beth and I had discussed, I had to speak to the assistant manager (her name starts with a D- I wanna say Donnie, but for the life of me, I can't remember her full name). She spoke to StacyLynn and immediately reached back out to me and was willing to accommodate. As soon as I got to the store, I felt an instant connection with StacyLynn. It was completely indescribable. At one point during my reading, we were both crying as she was doing a medium reading for me. I seriously felt like I could talk to her for hours. She's a truly gifted psychic/medium/clairvoyant. I can honestly say, this is now my favorite bookstore, despite my first visit. A huge thank you to Beth, "Donnie" (I'm so sorry if that's not her real first name), Emily (the receptionist), and ofcourse StacyLynn. You have a new, lifelong customer.

I know this is another typical McDonald's, but I really had no complaints. Maybe it's because the 2 times I've come here, it has been very late at night and not during peak hours or anything, but I really had no issues with my food. In fact, the hash browns (yes, I requested hash browns for my midnight munchies), were very fresh. Even the employees were nice to me. No issues here!

This place was pretty good. Not bad, not great....fairly decent. I got the burger with the chili and mac. Like I said, it was good but I wasn't amazed by it. When I was reading the reviews, I really expected this place to knock my socks off, but like I said, I wasn't totally amazed. To be 100% honest, I don't have a huge urge to go back. The guy who works the register & takes orders was a really nice guy and was always trying to accommodate, so that's really why I rated this place as highly as I did. Otherwise, if I want a burger or some comfort food, I'll definitely go somewhere else.

I'll be completely honest, I just go to PetClub to get my dog's food. I've never taken my dog here to get groomed or anything. But I can't stress enough how much I prefer this location over the location on alma school. The employees are so much nicer and attentive. I fully believe in the value of customer service and although the location on alma school is SO much closer to me than this one, I appreciate good customer service, so I'll drive the extra few minutes. The girl who helped me today was so so sweet and I felt like I was talking to a friend! I highly recommend this location above others in chandler.

I really like this dispensary. It's very small, but you get a really good one on one experience with your budtender. I also love that they allow you to be hands on and actually smell the product and they'll educate you on the strains you're unsure of. The people that work here are freakin' awesome! Seriously, just the nicest people you'll ever meet and it's such a laid back environment. Their price is always right and they show a lot of appreciation for your business.   Only downside is I feel like they don't have as big of a variety of strains as other dispensaries. Regardless, it's still pretty great.

I'll be honest, I didn't actually eat here. A friend had a party and I showed up really late. I had some drinks tho and still glanced over the menu and remnants of what had been left from everyone else. This place has a pretty cool vibe, the employees are nice, and it's just an overall pretty cool place. I'll definitely come back and enjoy a meal instead of just drinking.

Pretty cool little spot on Mill Ave. I've only ever been here later at night, so I'm not totally familiar with it when it's not a crowded, college kids bar scene. It's a super clean place, the bartenders have always been really awesome when I go in there, and they have fun games. My only complaint is that the outdoor area has close quarters. Idk how many times we were by the outside bar area and ping pong balls were hitting us or whatever. Otherwise, pretty cool spot.

Supposed to be 24 hour drive thru, but everytime I go, I get zero service. Won't ever go to this location again.

I saw another review that said this place is like thanksgiving dinner....it's so true! A friend and I were finishing up a meeting and we decided to go to lunch. While we were debating on where to go, I opened up Yelp, saw this places great reviews and we decided to go on an adventure!  When we got there, we were immediately welcomed by the owner/cook. We sat down and he immediately brought us warm bread and AMAZING hummus! Also brought us some hot tea. I'm not a fan of tea, but this was pretty good! Very sweet, with hints of floral. To be totally honest, we ordered the beef, but he brought us the chicken. We totally ate it anyway because it still looked so good. Seriously delicious! I will definitely be back. The owner was great and very centered around how the customers were doing.

Coming from someone who grew up on authentic Puerto Rican food, this food is legit. Seriously, it's delicious!

I really like this place. It's a bit more on the pricey side for boba tea places, but I really like their wide variety menu/concoctions. I ordered the ruby slipper and it was absolutely delicious. Only thing I substituted was the poppers; I ordered the white boba instead. The boba is made perfectly! For those who have never been here, it's at San Tan Village, wayyyyyy in the back by the Harkins theatre.

I'm an idiot for suggesting this place as a first date....you will get messy! I ordered the snow crab legs in the trifecta sauce with the #2 (medium) spiciness. Woo! I like spicy, but I should've gotten the mild #1! Delicious, but my nose was running and I was struggling lol. I'm glad they opened this location because it's so close and convenient. Anyways, this was the first time I had ever gotten snow crab. The king crab (which is usually what I go for at any seafood restaurant) was a tad pricey, so I passed and decided to try something different. Nothing compares to king crab legs, but the snow crab was a close second! I got the sausage added in there and that was also very good! I'm glad I stumbled on this place...it's seriously a fantastic spot if you're in the mood for good seafood.

Visited this dispensary for the first time yesterday and they did not disappoint! It's a very large, modern, beautiful dispensary. The staff is absolutely phenomenal and I can't wait for my next visit! The coolest thing about this place is that the dispensary is almost divided (by a beautiful glass door) so if you bring someone and they don't have their card, they can just wait on the "green room" (I think that's what the guy told me it was called), where they have a lot of pieces and general merchandise. On the other side of the glass door is where they actually keep the flowers, edibles, etc. They're a bit more on the pricey side than some of the other local places, but it is worth it. They have a lot of top line bud and the selection is FANTASTIC! They seriously carry every popular strain you can think of.
