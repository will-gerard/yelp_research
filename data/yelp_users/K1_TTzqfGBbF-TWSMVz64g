Best pizza in Phoenix!! This obscure family-owned restaurant makes the some of the best pizza that I've ever had. The crust isn't thin nor is it super thick-- it's between the too. The ambiance is casual and co-owner/wife Donna keeps the customers hydrated and engaged in the front portion of the restaurant while her husband prepares each meal individually in the kitchen. This hidden gem is located behind Bosa donuts. Highly recommend!!

For delicious, hot, quick Mexican food, you can't be Don Jose's. It's a Phoenix staple. No-frills, just simple food, cheap, and service with a smile. Bring cash only, no credit cards accepted, although there is an ATM  on-site. My favorite dishes are the nachos and bean & cheese tostadas--the pile it with cheese!

Love the delicious personal-sized pizza at Organ Stop Pizza!!! It's just the right size and made fresh. The thin crust reminds me of Shakey's pizza. You can't beat the atmosphere either...Live entertainment on a Wurlitzer Organ!! Great, inexpensive evening out for the entire family! And don't miss their salad bar and yummy ice cream selection!

Not just for luxury cars, although that's their specialty, Scott's Coachworks repaired my Mercury Milan after someone backed into it in a parking lot. Ron Carlson is a consummate professional and he took care of all the groundwork, working with the insurance company to get my car repaired in a timely manner. Ron made sure the repairs were done according to spec and they even detailed the car so it looked good as new. Ron kept me updated on the progress of the repairs and he made the process easy and stress-free; all I had to do was drop off the car and he handled the rest, including arranging for Enterprise car rental to pick me up at their shop in Phoenix. It's refreshing to deal with a business that takes pride in their work and delivers supreme customer service. I highly recommend Scott's Coachworks for your automotive collision repair needs, especially for classic and luxury cars.

This 24-hour veterinary clinic has grown out of its britches. There are so many customers that the staff seems overwhelmed every time we go there with one of our pets. Because the demand for their services as skyrocketed, quality of care has suffered and there's no continuity of care--we get a different vet every time we go in--and important documents slip through the cracks. Case in point, we recently had our dog euthanized two weeks ago and requested (and paid for) a private cremation with the ashes returned to us. After a week and a half of no news about our beloved dog's remains, I called the Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic to follow up. I was told to wait a few more days. The next day the office manager left me a voicemail stating that some paperwork wasn't filled out properly and my pet was cremated communally. His ashes would not be returned to us nor was his paw print obtainable, despite our request and signature on the proper paperwork. They were sure quick to charge us beforehand for the euthanasia and cremation services yet I wonder if they would've ever notified me of their error had I not followed up. Needless to say, we are livid and stunned over this error. Such a mistake cannot be undone and nothing they can say or do can fix this devastating mistake. We have 4 other pets and we've been loyal customers for several years, but this last incident was the nail in the coffin and we will NOT be returning! Makes me wonder how accurate the lab results were or if they mixed those up too.

This was our first visit to Durant's. It had been on my Bucket List for a while and it seemed like the perfect place to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. And I'm glad we did. As you enter through the back through the kitchen, you step back into the 1970s. We dressed up but other folks wore shorts or jeans; no flip flops. Valet parking is available. The petite 8 oz. filet mignon was delicious; tasty seasoning. We definitely suggest adding a half order of sautéed mushrooms to complete your entree, which includes soup or salad and a side dish. The waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary; we chose the original house cheesecake & it was a-maz-ing!! So creamy it melts in your mouth. Better than the Cheesecake Factory. I only wish I had left more room as I overindulged on the main course. Yes, it's pricey (for the 2 of us we spent $175 w/o alcohol and including tip), but the meal was delicious, the service was first-rate and it made for a memorable celebration. I expected Durant's to be hoity toity and I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't. The only negative is it's noisy inside and hard to hear your dinner companions. But ... that could be a good thing.

YIKES!! After reading 4 other reviews about this service I called them and Jill is right, their number is disconnected and so is their web page. I bought a 4-hour cleaning service voucher in December thru BuyWithMe and wanted to use it next week but my email went ignored and now I find their phone number is disconnected. Now what??!! The voucher has since disappeared on my BWM account. I hope I get reimbursed for my initial purchase. I feel like I've been scammed.

I decided to give this salon another try and I'm glad I did. This time one of the male employees did my gel French mani and his work was impressive. And he was quick; maybe a bit too quick on the hand massage but I'll let it slide. Julie is still running the show and conscientious. I like that they give you cold bottled water when you sit down. They got me in and out with no waiting. Nice job! I'll be back!

Yummy gelato and several flavors to choose from, but pricey for the serving size. Went here using a Groupon, otherwise too expensive for this pocketbook.

Rebe Homes team was a godsend when I needed to short sell my house during my divorce. They linked me with both legal and tax experts and educated me throughout the entire process. During the 13-month process Beth Rebenstorf kept me informed regularly as the team jumped through endless hoops and navigated the bureaucratic red tape. It was an arduous process but the Rebe Home team made it as painless as possible for me during this major life change. I've bought and sold at last six homes over the years and this was by far the most comfortable transaction, despite it occurring during a major upheaval in my life. Beth and Rebe Homes are professional, experienced and dedicated to their clients. They always put my needs first regardless of the bottom line. Beth and Rebe Homes went above and beyond traditional real estate consultants to successfully close the short sale of my home in Laveen. I'm eternally grateful to Beth and Rebe Homes for achieving success in a situation I thought was impossible. The next time I plan to buy or sell a home, Rebe Homes will be the first call I make!

I just finished another delicious meal at America's Taco Shop in Old Town Scottsdale! The have the best bean & cheese burros I've eaten, and I'm a burrito connoisseur. I appreciate the fact that their burritos are made lard-free and no pinto beans. And the staff is friendly and hardworking. Special shoutout to Connie--thanks for the great service!!  I Highly recommend this family-owned business!!

Kristie is an expert hair colorist. I trust her implicitly with my hairstyle and touchups. Whether you want highlights or low lights, she can make it happen. Her suggestions are spot on; she knows what looks good with your skin tone. I met Kristie through Groupon and was hesitant due to negative past experiences. Kristie's aptitude and knowledge restored my faith in hairstylists. I won't trust my hair with anyone else but her. Wherever she goes I will follow

I recently saw a burlesque show here and was disappointed in the venue. It was hard to see the stage because the seats weren't staggered or tiered, it was warm inside despite ample space, the sound system is antiquated and there's a pillar near near stage left that blocks the view for attendees. On the upside, The bartenders and private security staff are friendly and I feel the prices for drinks and hamburgers and hotdogs were reasonable. Definitely room for improvement.

First time here and it was my hubby's birthday so I wanted something out of the ordinary. Alo's Cafe was the perfect spot! This quaint café features a diverse menu with many of the sauces and jams house made. I love their strawberry jam--not overly sweet! Alo's make a mean cup of java and has a broad selection of teas and coffee drinks to choose from. Highly recommend the "make-your-own omelette"! Nice patio area but too hot outside for my liking, although they do have misters. Indoor seating is limited but fine for groups of two to four people. Downside: water tastes like tap water and the ice melted before it was delivered. Wait staff very friendly and helpful in their recommendations.

I tried this salon on Easter weekend and it was bumping. In fact I had to wait about 10 minutes before my mani was started. The staff seemed overwhelmed by the volume of customers but did their best to get everyone serviced. I didn't realize the salon has been open a year. The fees are the lowest I've seen in south Scottsdale.
