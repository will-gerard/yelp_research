Let me start out by saying that this is the first time I've ever had to write a bad review   Not because I've never been disappointed, but because it's never been THIS unsatisfying. I have no idea how this place has earned a 5 star rating. There is too many places in the valley to get decent to excellent pho (Pho Thanh being my fav!) Bad service. Over staffed and loud employees. Completely soggy noodles. Looked completely unappetizing (yes, I eat with my eyes). The beef in my partner's bowl was 90% fat. The egg rolls were almost too soft...had the texture of raw ground meat. The worst part of all, is they are the most expensive pho restaurant I've ever been to. To end this on a positive note, the place did a good job of creating some good ambience and was very clean (all that staff has to do something to keep busy ) Hoping you had an off day, Pho Viet. Good luck!

Seriously tasty made to order taco joint! Great vibe and decor. Tried the enchiladas this time....perfect! Beware of the SUPER hot green salsa....it's lethal but highly addictive! Awesome affordable place to get your mexi fix...LUCHA LIBRE!
