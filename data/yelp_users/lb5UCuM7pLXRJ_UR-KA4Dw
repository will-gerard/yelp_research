Planning a birthday celebration is always a little nerve-wracking, but when you couple it with the fact that the birthday hat sits on the male half of a brand new relationship, it's a recipe for anxiety and over analysis.   Should I just give him a gift card for the value menu at the closest Mickey D's? Should I print out all the selfies I've taken since we met? Should I give him a kitten? WHERE IS THE LINE?  I decided to go low-key and make some cupcakes. The plan was to meet him at his apartment wearing nothing but an apron, wielding a spatula full of chocolate frosting.   But.   THERE WERE NO APRONS TO BE FOUND.   Not even a child-sized one. Not even a giant one in the Outdoor Living section, demanding that everyone who lays eyes upon the wearer kisses the cook. The disappointment was visible on my face as I struggled to think of something else. Alas, my fantasy was not to be.   So thanks, Target, for ruining my fantasy and what would have been a solid birthday effort on my part. Instead he gets a kitten.   I'm still giving you five stars because you're Target and I will love you until the day I die.

I would strongly caution anyone who needs to finance a repair. Sell a kidney, pawn your discman, or roll your pennies instead. The interest rate on their no-credit-check financing is ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-NINE PERCENT. That's higher than a payday loan, which is capped out by usury laws at 39% in Arizona. When you apply for it online, before the repairs are done, there is NOTHING telling you that you will be in for that kind of shock. I literally thought the decimal was in the wrong place. I expected 18.99%; my credit is not that great, but it's over 600. I was a naive fool.   But when you're standing there at the counter, after they've had your car in the shop for three weeks (it was only supposed to take ten days and they were TERRIBLE about calling) and the repairs are completed, you may not have a choice. You may have to sign that contract that commits you to paying three times the amount of your actual loan, in order to get to work the next day. Because let's face it, this absolute robbery of a loan will have to be paid back in the next ninety days, so they can't charge you 189% interest.  As a side note, the transmission rebuild is fine. Whatever.

I had my first appointment on Tuesday, July 14th for X-Rays and an evaluation exam. I arrived on time at 5:15 pm with my paperwork already pre-completed but still had to wait until after 6:00 before I was taken back for X-Rays.   The staff was very personable and I didn't have to wait long before being evaluated by both the dentist and the hygienist, but when the evaluation was complete and I met with the office manager, I was a little taken aback. I have insurance through a dental HMO and this is my assigned office, but I was quoted $414 for the cleanings alone, and preventative services are supposed to be covered at 100% with my insurance.   I called and asked the office manager to send me an itemized list of the billing including the codes (because the paper she gave me in the office conveniently excluded all codes and had only a general description such as "cleaning" and "fillings"), so I could compare it to my dental insurance fee schedule. She sent it to me right away, but when I looked it over, I found some strange things.  When I looked over the items being billed, I discovered that I was being billed $129 for an Oral B Electric Toothbrush, $28 for prescription strength toothpaste, and $30 for stannous rinse.    The problem is that when I asked Brooke, the office manager that emailed me a copy of my invoice, to explain the extra charges, I never got a response. I asked for an explanation of the toothbrush, toothpaste and rinse, but I was completely ignored, even when I followed up with an email stating that I would have to cancel my appointment if the billing charges were not explained to me. When I still hadn't heard anything after six days, I canceled my appointment.    So now I have to go through the hassle of finding a new dentist, having a new evaluation done, and picking their billing apart as well, to make sure I'm not being fleeced by the billing department. I don't need an electric toothbrush, especially one that costs $129 and doesn't have Hello Kitty on it or anything. And I strongly recommend that anyone who has received a quote for dental work from this clinic take a long look at the actual codes being billed, because you might be paying for things you don't need and have not asked for.

Update: An office manager from another branch finally called me back today and when I asked about the $129 toothbrush, she told me that it was optional and all I had to do was tell them that I didn't want it. Well, if I didn't know it was even on there until I specifically asked for an itemized statement, how was I supposed to know to tell them to take it off? She asked me if I still wanted to get my teeth cleaned, but I couldn't hear anything else she said over the sound of my laughter.

The berry mojito is perfect, the fig and pig flatbread is epic, and it's a short hop over to the movie theater. I mean, it's no Dave and Buster's (it doesn't smell like teenage feet at ALL) but it'll do in a pinch.

I got here about 10 minutes before my OkCupid date arrived, and no less then seven people ask me if I needed help, just in the first two minutes of me standing by the front door. They told me I could go sit at a table to wait for him, but instead I opted to watch the cooks in the kitchen. I did even know hairnets for beards (beardnets?) were a thing!   I ordered a pear cider and it was the perfect compliment to the amazing leek and potato soup. My date was very engaging; I laughed too loudly and was very into him. Everything went so well, and he walked me to my car.   When I got home, it was immediately brought to my attention that I had a giant piece of lettuce between my front teeth, which had no doubt been there for at least five hours, since my salad at lunch.   I hope he sees that as me being into clean eating, instead of seeing it as me being a disgusting slob.

So I met a cute bearded ginger on OkCupid and we went on a few dates. He was a little bit intense, wanting to "talk about us" after two dates and making plans for next year so far in advance that my calendar didn't even go that far ahead, and I was planning on cutting him loose after our third date, but then he said he got me a present and I'm a total asshole so I agreed to a fourth date and man, am I happy that I did! He showed up with a GORGEOUS pair of Frye boots that I had mentioned I was saving for. I gave him an awkward closed-mouth kiss and sent him on his merry way. The only problem? These amazing boots couldn't slide up over my skinny jeans, no matter how hard I tried. I wailed and gnashed my teeth, then started researching shaft stretching on the Internet. After hurriedly changing my search to say "boot" shaft stretching, I found out that it's possible to stretch real leather using a stretching liquid. But I decided to not risk ruining the buttery leather by doing it myself, and a quick Yelp search of nearby shoe repair shops led me here. I schlepped in, boots in hand, and he suggested that instead of trying to stretch the leather, we add a nylon zipper to the inside. GENIUS. After only a four day wait (they were done a day earlier than I was quoted), I picked up a perfectly altered pair of knee-high Frye boots. The zipper looks like it was born there, and it added an inch to the calf circumference. My beefy calves rejoiced, I dumped the bearded ginger, and I did the Truffle Shuffle all the way home. Ten out of ten, would bring my leather here again.

I was really excited for another music venue to open up here in the valley; overall the building itself was great. The sound is decent, the decor is beautiful and the layout allows pretty much everyone a decent view of the stage, unless you're short, then you're out of luck. The floor is level and the only way for anyone under 5'7" to see anything is to be upstairs or in the front row.   We paid $110 for two general admission tickets and $60 for four drinks, and were not allowed to stand at the edge of the balcony because we didn't pay a couple of hundred bucks for a VIP couch. As far as I'm concerned, general admission means everyone can go anywhere, but that's not the case here. This place just opened a few weeks ago and there was really no way to know that. If I'd stood in line two hours before the door opened, maybe I could have had a decent view, instead I was kind of stuck in the back, sucking down a weak $15 drink. The floor was occupied by a sea of geriatrics in folding chairs, and if it had been standing room only, I could have slithered my way to the front.   The only other thing that irritated me is the fact that they had a few "employees", young girls dressed in cute outfits who were clearly just there to social network the shit out of this place because all they did was check tags and mentions on Twitter and Instagram, standing right in the fucking front of the balcony area, just dicking around on their phones. They were clearly disinterested in the musicians, and I know they were employees because the security guy confirmed it. Having your "employees" blocking the view of actual, paying customers is just bad fucking business.   Whatever. It was an expensive lesson and there's a lot of things I'd do differently if I was ever forced to come back here.   1) Arrive at least two hours early.   2) Sell an organ or two to be able to afford drinks (not my liver though, I'd need that).   3) Bring singles to tip the bathroom attendants (I can get my own goddamn paper towels, thank you, and I'm not tipping you just because you handed me a couple of Starburst candies).  4) Don't bother sweetly asking the douchebag who works for 95.5 The Mountain if you can stand in the corner of his mostly empty VIP area so you can actually see the stage, because he will be an asshole and say no, then lay on the couch with his dumbass ginger buddy, ignoring the stage and checking his phone instead.
