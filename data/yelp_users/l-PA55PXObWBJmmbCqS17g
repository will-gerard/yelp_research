Delicious food, knowledgeable staff, and a modern-chic setting. I loved the Vogue Martini and my husband enjoyed his Vogue Manhattan. The Vogue Burger was nothing short of perfection. It was prepared just as I ordered it and had a well-balanced flavor. The sweet potato fries with maple dipping sauce were a perfect pairing. We moved to the area this past spring and love living here even more now that we have a restaurant like Vogue Bistro on our block. It's perfect for a date night or even a night out with good friends!

DISGUSTING. From the atmosphere to the food. Old, run down, holes in chairs, wobbly tables, dirty restrooms... Immediate turn off from the get go. I thought maybe the food would be ok, it was not. I had the two shredded beef taco combo. The shells were store bought, not homemade. The tacos, beans, and rice were soaked from a ridiculous amount of liquid on the plate, I am assuming from the shredded beef. It was less than mediocre food. Here's the kicker - the waitress even screwed up our tab! She did the math completely wrong. She totaled up food, tax, and gratuity (6 or more you get 16% gratuity added) and it was $176!!!! Whaaaat?? The real total was $82. Ugh. Got it fixed and left. This morning I am layingj in bed feeling incredibly sick to my stomach. Started last night... Worse today. Do not eat here!!! Cook at home or go to a better place for Mexican food.

Our friends have been telling us about this place for a long time. My husband and I finally got to try it out on Friday night. There was a very small wait but we were super lucky to score a spot at the bar while we waited. We were very impressed with the 30+ beers that they had available on tap. We appreciated that each beer had an explanation of the type it was as well. The bartenders were very gracious and even offered samples of beer too. Both beers that I had were completely delicious and the amount I got exceeded my expectations. I believe they were 16 ounces a piece. Our friends also kept telling us about how delicious the food was. My husband and I each got one of the Sammy's (sandwiches). They did not disappoint! I highly recommend the Matador!! For dessert we tried their homemade pop tart which that night was a bananas foster type. So incredibly delicious, it reminded me of a toaster strudel but gourmet. It was quite a busy night and we did have to sit outside, and it was quite warm that night. Hoping to sit inside next time. Will definitely be back to this place!

Docs are nice and what not... But the wait times are RIDICULOUS!!!! I don't know if they over schedule or what, but it's not out of the norm to wait 30 min to an hour after your scheduled appointment time before you are called back or seen. It's just nuts. Is every gyno office like this now? Wasn't like this 3 years ago with my first pregnancy through St. Joes.

I am giving Party Planet a rave review for customer service! I was searching for a cake for my husbands 30th bday party. I wanted something unique because it was also his graduation for his masters degree. Every private decorator was going to charge an arm and a leg for the "science" themed cake I wanted. I read a  review about Party Planet and their cakes, so I decided to stop in. I described the cake I wanted and the employee, Andrew, helped me design and cater one to what I wanted. We took a design they already had and just altered it. Not only that, he helped me do Periodic Table lettering by using his own computer to make the design. Then the store printed it on sugar paper. The price was right too!! This was above and beyond service. We picked up the cake a couple of weeks later and also decided to get balloons. We ordered a very small bouquet but the employee once again went above and beyond by putting a "long lasting" gel so they'd last through the party! He even offered my daughter a free pink balloon. She was ecstatic! Thank you Party Planet for helping my husbands party be a success. P.S. Everyone loved the cake!
