Great pizza and service here.  They are a key player on our take out rotation.  We like do do a half Lil' Italiana and a Half Get Meaty but sub the Canadian bacon with meatballs.  Omnom

Not too shabby!  If you are looking for some solid Pad Thai then enjoy yo self because this hit the spot.  The shrimp rolls were yummy and we will definitely hit this place up again when the Pad Thai craving hits..

They used to have some awesome Tortas on the menu but they sometimes have the bread if you ask they can make them.  I really like the fish tacos omnomnom

As with most bars the service tends to be hit or miss but the food is nice and greasy.  All and all not a bad place to hang out..

This specific location is my favorite place to eat.  The food is outstanding and the owner has never failed to greet our table.  For the record I do have a horrible addiction to sushi and they do not disappoint.  The newer locations are good but I prefer the "hole in the wall/ma and pa" places and this location just feels more authentic to me.  We have been having my birthday dinners here for the last 17 years and that tradition will continue!

Def a go to breakfast/lunch joint.  Good prices and great food.  Boars Head is always a big win.  If you need breakfast or a deli fix you can't go wrong here..

Not my favorite.  The pizza was OK but the carne asada fry's broke my heart.  Probably will not get again..

Fantastic!  We picked up some tamales,  empanadas arepas and guayaba to go and it was as Will Feral once said "scrumptrelecent".   I have never had an Ecuadorian Tamale before and its friggin awesome.      We will definitely be back for more..

Very good for a chain, I mean the Shaniac is magical.. when it comes to pulled pork though, my preference would be Pork on a Fork..

Nothing like a handmade tortilla drenched in butter!  The Oaxaca Special is the perfect anytime burrito as well..

This is my favorite place to go for Neapolitan pizza.  The service is usually average to weak and I wish they had a location on the north side but the food is worth it.  Its all about the margarita pizza with the shrimp bruschetta and a big bottle of coke.  Happy happy joy joy.

These guys are really awesome.  Don't bother with Pita Jungle Corporate Pita Pimps, you want Chicago Gyro trust me.  Greasy Heaven!

Awesome fish n chips and it stood up to some places we ate at in San Diego.  If you want some greasy fish and chips look no further!

Awesome custard and burgers.  Nothing says greasy happiness like cheese curds.  They do it right considering they are a big chain..

I try to not give out 2's and 1's for ratings but I really can't stand Pappa Johns..  Do yourself a favor and pay a few bucks more for some good pizza.  If you insist on greasy chain pizza, Hungry Howies is the only choice..

This place is very yummy although my personal preference is the 59th and Bell location.  The food is good but its a loud open set up.  We have always had good dining experience and its right by the theater which makes it a good choice for date night.

Awesome Pulled Pork and Smoked Sausage.  The ribs are great and I love the Mac and Cheese with Waffle Fire.  We get our BBQ fix a couple times a month at minimum..

Not too shabby for a chain.. we will probably be back for more in the future but I think I would prefer if Dickies BBQ (which was there before)was still there :/

So we ordered this place for take out based off the other strong reviews.. We got a pepperoni pizza which was ok and the bruschetta which was disappointing.  It was drowning in oil and there was no liner in the box so it was an oily nightmare. I was really looking forward to that bruschetta too.. ugh.. The owner seemed very nice  but they don't take Amex, which is annoying, so all and all we probably won't be back.  I wanted to try some other stuff on the menu that looked good but we were pretty disappointed so probably stick with our normal Pizza/Italian joints in the future..

We ordered for take out.. it was pretty good and comparable to some other places we have tried.  They have some interesting takes on Chinese so I would recommend if you are looking for something kinda different..
