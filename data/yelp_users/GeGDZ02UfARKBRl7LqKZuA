Pretty good food. Shows up hot & fast and the service was some of the best I've had. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.

This is a pretty cool place with good lunch options and a nice overall vibe. Well worth dropping by and trying just about any of the sandwiches on the menu. Sit outside and enjoy the cool farm & trees.

I seem to always get unlucky here and end up with a server that disappears for long periods of time. The food isn't bad, but it's really kind of hard to screw up mostly serving breakfast items, so that's not really saying a lot. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a long time if they're busy. It's not worth the wait.

The food here is pretty good. I've had quite a few things off the menu and am yet to be disappointed.  It's definitely not the cheapest place to eat but the food is worth it.  I've only been here around lunch time and if you're there during the peak times for lunch, it gets really busy and it's hard to find a place to sit.

Slow service, mediocre food. The only reason we went was because we had a gift card and I probably won't be back.

Awesome sandwiches.  I've been here a few times now and every time, the sandwiches are fresh and filling.  This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in town. The service is great and all of the staff are always friendly.

If you're in the mood for an Asian buffet, this is probably the best option in the Ahwatukee/Chandler area. It's definitely not cheap but if you take advantage of the sushi, it's worth it. The buffet foods are pretty good. Even the standard options like orange chicken are above average. The staff is usually pretty friendly and do a good job keeping drinks filled.

I'm a big fan of this place. Location is convenient, staff is knowledgable and friendly, and they have a good inventory of what you need. I've taken classes here, bought multiple firearms from them and used the range quite a few times and have always had a great experience.

This place has sooo much good pork.  If you want something that is pork or made from pork, you'll probably find it here and it'll be good.

Good food, decent service.  Ordering and getting food were a little slow.  We were 3rd in line when we got there and it was about a 10 minute wait to order and then another 20+ minutes to get food.  For this type of place, that's a bit slow.  Once the food arrived, we weren't disappointed.  Burritos, tacos, and enchiladas were all excellent.  It was definitely a step up from other Mexican restaurants in the area.  We'll definitely be back.

My wife and I were hanging around Scottsdale for the day and I pulled this place up on yelp. The reviews made it sound like a good choice for dinner so we stopped by.   It was surprising that at 6PM on a Saturday night, we were the only ones there. I wasn't overly impressed with the speed of getting our sandwiches, but maybe there was more prep that went into them than I thought. From the time we ordered it was about 15 minutes until we got our food.   My wife got a grilled salami sandwich. Judging by her "It's just ok" reaction when I asked how it was, it wasn't really anything spectacular. I had the pastrami sandwich. Judging by the reviews for this place, I figured that would be a good choice. Maybe it was bad timing (end of the day?) but this was probably the worst pastrami sandwich I've had in a long time. The pastrami was pretty dry and lacked flavor. The bread was a little stale tasting but wasn't horrible.   I doubt I would come back to this place. There are a lot of better options for food in the area. If you're really craving a deli, it's not a bad option, but don't go out of your way just to eat here.

Awesome lunch specials. Everything I've had here has been great. I would give this 5 stars but most of the time it seems like the staff is slow and doesn't care a whole about giving good service. Maybe it's that we normally come in as a group of 6 or 8 people but that's still not an excuse to leave drinks sitting empty when we're the only ones in there.   My favorite is getting the lunch special pizza and having prosciutto added to it. Very filling and only $6.50. That's pretty hard to beat. Especially in downtown Chandler.

I have friends who love this place, but it's really just bland and overpriced. $13 for a small burrito, taco, and drink is way too much for what it is. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's within walking distance of where I work, so if I'm really craving this style of food, it's not a horrible choice.

I was worried that with all the hype, this place wouldn't live up to my expectations. I've been here a couple times now and am not disappointed with it at all. Best pizza I've had in Phoenix BY FAR. Service was great, crust was perfect, toppings were fresh and creative. Definitely worth going back.

Joe's is good BBQ with a great atmosphere.  The meat is generally pretty good and the sides are excellent.  I think I could eat the beans all day if that wouldn't result in being kicked out of my own house.  They really seem to care about their customers (customer appreciation day = free food) and from what I hear, they are crazy about the consistency of their food.  If you really want to get a taste for their food, do the BBQ sampler...otherwise the meat plate should be plenty of food for most people.

This place is great for getting a decent priced sandwich and not walking away hungry.  Sometimes I get a half sandwich and the Wisconsin cheese soup in a bread bowl, which is really good.  I've tried just about every sandwich they have and they have all been great.  The bread is soft and fresh.  It's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.

I've heard several people mention this lately and ask me what I thought about it. I figured it was time to give it a shot and see if it was worth adding to my list of BBQ options in the Phoenix area. Let's just say that I won't be back and won't be recommending it to anyone. The meats all seemed undercooked and were lacking in flavor. You shouldn't need a knife to cut brisket but you do here. The only thing saving it from one star is that the sauces were decent and I didn't hate the seasoned fries. If you want good BBQ, this is not a good option.

The food is good and seems fresh.  Lunch prices are great.  Dinner is a little on the pricey side for what you get, but it's still worth it.  Nothing is really spicy.  We've had most of what is listed as being spicy on the menu and it's really pretty mild.  If you're in need of something with a lot of spice, it may be worth asking to have the food made to be extra spicy or just try somewhere else.  The orange chicken is probably my favorite.  It's way better than what you get from somewhere like Panda Express.  There isn't really much seating inside, so you pretty much want to just plan on it being take-out.

The pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about. Otherwise, everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip. There are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior. Skip this place and try somewhere else.

The food at Waldo's isn't bad.  It's not even close the best BBQ around, but for the cost, it'll work.  My biggest issue with this place is that the service is normally very slow and sometimes really sucks.  We went there last night and it had a few open booths to sit in but there was a 10-15 minute wait to get a seat because they only had one person waiting tables.  I would have had no problem with the wait, but I know from past experience that they seem to run thin on wait staff here and service suffers as a result of that.  The last time we ate there, everyone in our party had food come out at different times (5+ minute spacing between bringing plates out) and drinks sat empty until one of us got up and pulled the waiter aside to ask for refills and the rest of our food.  If you want cheap BBQ and don't mind weak service, this is probably one of the better choices in town.  If you like to drink while you dine and have your waiter/waitress pay attention to you, this isn't the place.

Everything I've had here has been great tasting. My favorite so far is the red curry chicken. Have them make it extra spicy if you're into that kind of thing. I am and it turns out great. The only thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars is that the portions are kind of small.

Food is average subs if you're looking for that kind of thing but their register does math wrong and overcharges. Rang up $24 for a $19.99 family meal. Employees are idiots and said that was tax. 20% tax? I think not...  Shady business practice...won't be back.

This place is awesome.  The service is great and the food is the best I've had for the price.  Ive tried a few different things on the menu and haven't been disappointed.  My favorite is the grilled mozzarella and fontina sandwich.  Their roast beef is an excellent choice too (hot or cold).  I have tried several of their homemade ice creams and all of them are sooooooo good. If you're in the area and looking for somewhere to eat, this is it.

I really like Murphy's Law. So far I haven't had anything that was bad. There were a few daily specials that were just kind of "meh" compared to other things I've had but all in all, it's worth stopping by here if you're looking for food in downtown Chandler.  It's usually quick and easy to grab lunch, so if you're in need of good lunch that's not going to exceed your lunch hour, this is a great choice.  Make sure you get the sweet potato fries for a side...they're good :)

Not good. Waited 15 minutes to order and 25 minutes for food. Brisket was like chewing leather and was almost cold. Mac and cheese were nothing special. Cornbread was more like ice cold yellow cake. I don't know what kind of low grade BBQ the Yelpers who gave this good marks are used to but it must be horrible.   Highly disappointing as I was hoping for a new option for BBQ but this isn't it. Even the big chain places are better than this.

Like others that have reviewed this place, I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, it just wasn't very good. Food was slow (40 minutes to get food after ordering), bland, and luke warm. The tuna I got was supposed to have a "Caribbean" flavor but I'm pretty sure they forgot the spices or whatever was supposed to go on it because there was pretty much no flavor to it.  My wife got a pasta dish that had about  a half inch of oil in the bottom of the bowl.  Just not appetizing.

These guys make a pretty good sub. It's a lot better than most of the other sub options around, especially the large chains. The service here is always fast and friendly. Their bread is good and meat sliced fresh. Mike's way is the way to go with your toppings...good stuff.

Zoyo is the best froyo option in the Ahwatukee/Chandler area. The flavors are all really good, topping selection is great, and the people working there always seem friendly. I take my daughters here at least once a week. They love it.   The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that it seems like they've stopped rotating in new flavors lately. For the past couple months, I've pretty much had to stick with a mix of cake batter and oatmeal cookie, which is good, but I'd like to see a few flavor changes like some of the other places in the area.

I'm not a ramen connoisseur or anything, so maybe I'm not the best person to judge the quality of what these guys are serving. What I can say though is that it's pretty darn good, the price is right, and the portions are huge. I'm also a big fan of the service here. If you're not picky and just want something good and different, it's definitely worth the trip.

I like the food from Hawg and Dawg.  I usually get a 1/4 lb dog with the green hornet toppings.  The chicago style is decent too.    As far as their barbecue goes, it's good enough for a quick fix but isn't really anything special.  The sides aren't really all that great.  They are mostly bland and boring.  I suppose some people like that but I want a little spice or flavor.  One thing that really bothers me is that they close at 7pm on weeknights and have even been closed at times when they should be open based on the hours on the window.  That being said, if you can make it over there while they're open, the hot dogs are worth the trip.  *UPDATING MY ORIGINAL REVIEW*  Apparently the owners here don't understand that if you have posted hours that you'll be open, it's probably a good idea to respect your customers and actually be open at that time. I can understand if you have an emergency and just can't open up one night, but now it has been 5 times that I've made the drive over there and they were closed during hours they should have been open. Yesterday, we went by and there was a sign saying they are at some vendor event and they are closed for a couple days. That's unacceptable if they think they're going to survive as a business. It already takes a special trip to go there since there isn't anything else around that most people would go to in that area. At this point, my recommendation is to just save the gas and make your own hot dogs. They're not worth repeated trips over just to find out you're not going to get one anyway.

By far the best and friendliest BBQ store around. Good group of guys running the place. Competitive pricing. This place makes all the other barbecue stores around town seem like a joke.   Take one of their classes, hang out and chat, or just run by and pick Shelton or Mike's brain on all kinds of outdoor cooking topics.  Their sauce and rub selection is probably the best in Arizona.

This is probably the best place to get brisket in Arizona and in line quality-wise with the best places I've had in Texas. I do a lot of BBQ and eat a lot of BBQ and these guys clearly know what they're doing. The sausages (both the regular and hot) are great, creamed corn is awesome, and pecan pie is sooooo good. It's easily worth the trip down there. Just make sure you bring cash.

This used to be Al's Chicago Style Hot Dogs.  We went in expecting that it would just be similar food and service with a different name.  Boy, were we wrong.  The service is really, really slow.  It took 20 minutes to get 3 hot dogs and a gyro with only 2 other customers in the place.  The other customers were pretty upset about how slow it was and actually said something and ended up with free cheesecake.  We didn't say anything and weren't even offered an apology for the slowness even though they knew they were slow.  The whole vibe that Al's had and the quality of food, service, etc. has been lost and we won't be back.  It's sad too, because we started going to Al's a couple weeks after it opened several years ago.  Definitely going to miss it.  If you want Chicago style food, this isn't going to be the best place in town, but if you're close, it's convenient.

I've had friends ship bagels to me from New York and they were always better than anything I can get here in Phoenix. The bagels here at Bagel Man are just as good as anything I've had from New York. The service is good and friendly. Prices are great. Sandwiches are awesome. My favorite is the Rich & Famous on a salt bagel. Definitely worth the trip.

The food here is ok. Service is decent. Realistically, there are several options in this area (ie. Pei Wei or Rumbi) where you can get similar style food that tastes better and wont cost as much. $3+ for an iced tea...$9.99 for a basic, regular sized bowl. I figured it was worth a try...but likely won't be back.

Not the worst BBQ I've had but expect to end up with some luke warm and dried out meat. The brisket is average at best. Wasn't a fan of the pork at all. Really, it's nothing special but if you absolutely need some BBQ and you're in the area, it's decent. Otherwise, there are better options in the east valley.

I was really looking forward to this place opening and hoped it would be good but now I'm trying to decide between one and two stars. I think two stars would lead people to believe there's something worth going here for. I've been to the one in Ruidoso and I remember it being a fair bit better. Nothing I've had here really has much flavor. If this is what these guys consider quality BBQ, they either don't have taste buds or have never had real BBQ.  The mac & cheese was horrendous. I'll normally put up with weak mac & cheese but this stuff makes Kraft seem gourmet and flavorful.   The corn is waterlogged and literally had no flavor.   You can get better sausage from the old lady giving out lunch samples at Sam's Club.  The tri-tip didn't have any flavor. I expected some kind of spice or beef flavor...or I don't know...maybe some smoke since they claim they can't stop smokin'. It just wasn't good.   Save your money and go somewhere else.

Planet Sub is definitely a good option for solid, good tasting subs. I'm next door at Gangplank a couple times a week and we usually hit this place up for lunch. It's much better than the last place that was in this spot, has tons of options (we decided you could eat lunch there for a month and not have the same sandwich), and friendly staff. I'm definitely glad they put this in. It's a great option in the downtown Chandler area.

Rudy's is probably some of the best BBQ here in Arizona. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars from me is that there have been a couple times that the brisket wasn't quite right and the cashiers seem to have a habit of not listening very well to an order. Other than those two minor issues, this place is definitely worth the trip.   Oh...and can't forget the breakfast tacos...so goooood.

Judging by the other reviews, I was expecting this place to be pretty awesome. I have  a feeling that none of the people giving it high ratings so far have had good BBQ.   Honestly, this is probably the most overcooked BBQ I've ever had, with the exception of the brisket, which was tough and clearly undercooked. The ribs were pretty much mush. They couldn't even be picked up. The bones just slid out of the meat. That's called overcooked. Ribs should NOT fall off the bone. The pork was dry and a bit tough. I wouldn't be surprised if they were serving leftovers of that. The chicken was even drier than the pork. There wasn't enough sauce in the building to bring that back to life.   As far as the sauces go, the sweet & spicy one (whatever it's called) was pretty good. Better than most sauces you'll find elsewhere. The teriyaki was horrendous. That's a flavor that doesn't belong with BBQ in any way, shape, or form. I tried it with each of the meats and none of them went well with it.   I also wasn't impressed with the overall vibe of the place. It felt dead & the staff seemed less than enthusiastic to be there.   If you're in the area and they're open, it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good BBQ is. Otherwise, it's a no-go.

This place was surprisingly good. Service is solid, lunch specials are priced well, and the food was spot on. I will definitely be back. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me was that the Thai iced tea was way more ice than tea...which is a little lame considering what they charge for those.

Slowest service I've had in a long time and the sushi wasn't anything special. It was over 30 minutes from the time we sat down until the first of 3 rolls showed up at our table...with only 8 total customers in the whole place. Their prices aren't horrible but they're not worth the wait when there are a half dozen better sushi options within a few miles of here.

They've served food at this location 2 days so far and I've been here 2 days now. Everything on the menu is great. 6 of us from the office went there today and picked up a little of each meat, a couple sides, and some drinks. The brisket is amazing and the best you will see in Arizona. Beef ribs were unreal. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, well flavored, and very meaty. I wasn't going to try the turkey but after getting a small sample, we ordered a few slices. The sausage was probably the best smoked sausage I've had. The grits were good. They have bottled coke. Service is friendly. About as perfect of an opening I've seen for any restaurant. Of course, they've been practicing quite a bit at farmers markets and various other places where I've had their BBQ too.   Great people, great place. Highly recommended.

This place was pretty amazing and the service is some of the best service I've had at any restaurant. The owner clearly cares about the experience and making sure that customers enjoy their experience. Everything we had was great. The mix of options and flavors should be enough to make just about anyone happy. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Vegas.

Maybe this was just an off day but almost everything was dried out and/or soggy. They claimed that the beef is brisket but if it was, they either overcooked and reheated it in sauce or it's low grade (select probably) and too lean. The pork was dried out and had very little flavor. Ribs were tough and undercooked. The creamed corn was more like soup that had a few pieces of corn in it and the mac & cheese was so soggy that I'm not even sure there was any mac in it.   I don't know where these good reviews are coming from but unless I just got extremely unlucky, they're either people who only eat at bad chain BBQ restaurants or like their meat to be more like leather.   I really wanted to like this place as the people running it seem like good people but the food just wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was a waste of $50 for one 4 meat plate and 2 kids meals with drinks.

Really not a fan of this place. The bagels are overpriced and lower quality than you'd get from a grocery store. I've tried a few different options and nothing was good. The salt bagel tasted more like blueberry, the everything bagel might as well be an onion bagel, and the cinnamon raisin bagels are basically a plain bagel with a faint hint of flavor. They're dense and chewy. If these are fresh, they probably need to figure out a better plan because they seem stale compared to a truly fresh bagel.  I wanted to like this place as it's within walking distance of my house but there are quite a few options nearby that are better. They should probably just stick to coffee but that's overpriced and nothing special too.
