Great view, loved the patio! Wine and beer selections are solid. Went for restaurant week and the food was amazing!! Though they were out of the dessert that had convinced me to choose that place initially :(   However, looking at their regular menu, I don't know if I'll be back. It's a little too like pub fare and doesn't really fit the atmosphere this place has, in my opinion. If they had more unique entrée and dessert options, like the ones on the restaurant week menu, then this place would be a definite go-to spot!

Never gotten food or anything, but def a fun night out! No matter what you're feeling: laid back shuffle board, country 2 stepping, or hip hop...they have it. Always some great people watching too. Just remember to bring cash, as they don't take card

LOVE! Not the prettiest thing compared to say, the river walk in San Antonio, but this is AZ. It's a great place for running, biking, walking, etc. It's a great way to travel on bike between old town and arcadia. Especially since OHSO is right on the canal!

Probably my favorite location. Staff is always friendly, and the smoothies can't be beaten

Awesome view and patio!! Delicious cocktails and honestly, for the quality and location, $14 is definitely pushing it, but still reasonable. Any higher priced and I would have docked them a star. Appetizers at the car are decently priced, too. Edamame and fries were super yummy

Love this place usually, but this is hands down the slowest and most sub-par service I've ever had at one of these. The majority of people in line when I first got here left before ordering because it was so slow

This is a pretty solid sushi restaurant. A bit pricey, but the ambience is awesome. My boyfriend and I went last month, and our table wasn't ready until 20 min after our reservation. The bf wasn't exactly pleased as he had spent a lot of time planning the evening. The GM Steve was very gracious though, and brought us some amazing appetizers! Definitely helped to smooth things over. Everything we had was amazing. My favorite was probably the yellowtail appetizer!

My favorite place to go for a bike ride, walk, or run in Scottsdale. TONS of places along it. It's only a block or so off from Old Town, runs by McCormick Ranch (ie easy access to the Vig), has a great coffee shop on it called Altitude Coffee and also Grassroots (restaurant) up near Hayden and Via de Ventura, and then if you take it down to the south end, there is an awesome park.   It's just such a pretty area and offers great views of Camelback Mntn and lots of golf courses and parks.

The trippel sandwich was delicious. But that's where the list of pros ends. Good beer list, but the waitress literally knew NOTHING about beer! We asked her what exactly a barleywine was, she looked at the list, and said "oh that section tells where the beer was made"... We then had to explain to her where the list of breweries was, and how that was different than the type. She also didn't know much about the menu Tortilla soup apparently means potatoes, carrots, and pork in broth with saltines... Not what I would call tortilla...  Train your staff better. Overall disappointing since I've had the food truck stuff before at a festival and remember really liking it

Most rude manager I've dealt with in awhile. I simply ordered a tea with cream, but asked for coconut milk because I have a dairy allergy. She tried to charge me for a full latte stating that they had to charge me for the very small amount of coconut milk I'd asked for. I have never had this issue at any other Starbucks. To top it off, I don't know how you manage to mess up tea, but it was very burnt/bitter tasting. I'll be going across the way to Lola next time.

Solid Asian restaurant and has some good Korean options which are hard to find around here! I've been twice (once for take out and once to dine in) Service was decent, nothing stellar, but we did come semi close to closing time. All of the food I've had has been good and they have some unique sushi rolls. I mean, you know it's gonna be good Asian food if over 50% of the patrons are Asian both time you go.   Definitely worth checking out!

Been here for almost 6 months now and I love it! I tried several other boxes in the area before finding Blur and I knew by the end of the first week that I'd be staying at this one.   The coaches are great people and really knowledgeable. I'm a big stickler about form, so I definitely wanted to be somewhere where the coaches paid attention to technique and safety, and all of them do at Blur.   The workouts are definitely challenging, but the coaches are more than willing to scale whatever is needed. Everyone has a lot of fun and are very encouraging of each other.   Awesome gym for anyone from a newbie to a seasoned crossfitter.

Good cheap Mexican food. Nothing fancy and nothing that will knock your socks off...I mean, c'mon, this is AZ. There is lots of competition for Mexican places, so this place would be top notch anywhere else, but here, it's the best in the area for price, taste, and convenience. It's where I go for good Mexican food when I don't feel like driving to sketchy parts of central or south Phoenix (Carolina's, La Santisima, etc)

Guacamole didn't taste fresh, they messed up our order, everything moved very slow, and there was a very limited number of vegetarian options for my friend. The waiter was friendly enough, but disappeared frequently and forgot to bring stuff. To top it off, while some of the items are creative, this just isn't quality Mexican food

Okay, I'm admittedly biased since I'm one of the PTs here. But I absolutely love the clinic, my coworkers, the company, and the patients. It's always a fun environment and all of the PTs, myself included, try to give patients the best care possible.   The reasons that l chose to work here are the same reasons I believe it is the best PT clinic in the area: We are more concerned with quality of care instead of quantity. At the end of the day, it does not matter how many patients were seen or what revenue was brought in. What truly matters to the staff and the company is that the patients are getting better and are happy with the care they receive.  Tip: OSR offers Free Pain Assessments for new patients. It's a one time no-commitment appointment where a PT does a brief evaluation of your injury, performs a short treatment session, explains the injury and treatment options, and makes recommendations. This could be that the injury isn't serious and just needs an exercise program (which would be developed and given to you), that it could benefit from a few or more PT sessions, or that it warrants further evaluation and imaging by a physician (in which case, you'd be given referral options). So if you have an injury that's bothering you, and you're not sure if it's something that will work out on it's own or need treatment, just come in and find out!  Tip #2: Just in case you aren't aware, AZ is a direct access state. That means you can come see a physical therapist without a referral :)

Fantastic dinner the other night at Virtu! Our server was amazing and very open and helpful with recommendations.   Everything we had was incredibly delicious and perfectly prepared: Octopus appetizer Duck entrée with foie gras flan Scallops   The cocktail I had (can't remember the name, but it was rye whiskey with blueberries and lemon I believe) was also really good  Cant go wrong here. Great food, great service, and great ambiance

I'll admit, I'm addicted to self serve fro-yo. I was between 4 and 5 stars because I hate it when I have to get a staff member to get me a sample of fro-yo rather than get it myself. I just feel like an inconvenience, regardless of whether or not that's true.   Went with 5 because the flavor and consistency of the fro-yo is one of the best in the valley. And they have one that's pretty identical to Dole Whip from Disney Land.  The owner is super cool, too. I talked to him a decent bit one day about Crossfit.   Haven't had anything other than fro-yo, but their smoothies and all look amazing

Great beer selection and one hell of a good burger. Great service, but then again, I knew my bartender/server...he's the reason I went to check it out in the first place.

Love the vast amount of flavor and drink options! And free wifi is always a nice amenity. The lady working was very patient with how indecisive I was and made great recommendations. The guy with the boot on that was working is a different story. He was rude and snippy and very short with me. Would have been 5 stars if it weren't for his demeanor and attitude as well as the lack of outlets

Awesome bourbon/whiskey/scotch selection! Small bites are good, too. Minus a star for price, though I definitely don't expect it to be cheap considering the quality of liquor. Just slighty more of an upcharge than I would prefer

Definitely my new regular stylist! Jessica is this first person I've gone to in years that actually made a suggestion on a new haircut (I've been asking every stylist I've been to for 4 years, which is about 6 people) that would work for my active lifestyle and super thick and curly hair. I absolutely LOVE it! Great cut, and on top of that, Jessica and her husband are just very nice and friendly people.

I'll update this once I actually go to this location, but the Chandler location is one of my FAVORITE bars in the Phoenix area! Sooo excited to have one near me now. Get ready for great live music and awesome beer and whiskey/bourbon selection :)

Solid build-your-own healthy rice/noodle/salad bowl place. The ingredients all tasted and looked very fresh, and there is a wide selection of options. Similar to GrabbaGreen, but I'd say a little better.   I can't remember the name of it, but I had an Asian noodle bowl and it was very good. Would be nice if it were slightly cheaper, but what can you expect with how trendy these types of places are now.

SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! This is a must try.   Went with a friend and the girl at the counter suggested splitting the coconut shrimp appetizer and one order of fish tacos since neither of us were overly starving.   This was perfect! The coconut shrimp app was the best I've ever had. Not greasy at all and the dip was amazing. And there is nothing I could possibly critique about the tacos. They are to-die for!!  Go here now. Be prepared to have a new fish taco obsession. Sorry not sorry

Had brunch here last weekend with the bf. Points for dog-friendly patio, awesome service, friendly wait staff, aaaaand food:  bf had the caesar salad which he said was pretty standard, nothing special. I had the pork green chile tacos with an over-easy egg and added a side of rice per the waitresses suggestion. SOOOOO GOOD!!!!! This was seriously amazing. Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. The rice was also awesome to sop up all of the juices from the chile bowl. I was basically in a food coma the rest of the day   Back on a smaller, less traveled road, so pretty quiet. Also has pretty cool bike racks outside
