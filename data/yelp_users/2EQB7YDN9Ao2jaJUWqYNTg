Hole in the wall place, but man they had excellent food! I got a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and though it's appearance was standard, it tasted superb.

Where do I start? Horrible service. We came in with 13 people and the restaurant was half empty. Plenty of space for the entire party but the owner and manager refused to move either of the tables together. From start to end we were very disappointed. We will not be back and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good service and a relaxing time.

You can't go wrong choosing Camelback CrossFit. The workouts are well planned, the coaches are knowledgable and friendly, and the people who you meet here become your family. Cost-wise it's also one of the most affordable CrossFit gyms in the valley! I love working out here and would recommend it to any of my friends looking to get fit.
