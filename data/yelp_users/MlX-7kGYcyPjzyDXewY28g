This place is amazing! I came in looking for a suit or tux for a cruise I will be going on next week. That didn't leave much time or wiggle room, but I wanted to give it a try.   Penny helped get me all set up even though it was very last minute and on Saturday. She found exactly what I was looking for, made great suggestions on colors and styles, and made sure I had options while I am away to make the outfit work great.   Stephanie made alterations to my pants, jacket, and even got everything sized and made sure it fit perfectly before I was out the door. Overall, it only took about 20 minutes and they even made sure to press and iron everything first. During the process they even asked me about it and genuinely want to know about what I did and what I needed the tux for.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for anything they offer. They price was very fair, especially for last minute, and their wonderful service and attention to detail really made the experience great.

Giuseppe's is great Italian food! The deserts are home made I believe daily and the food is always fresh and delicious. They are great about making you exactly what you want. The tortellini is my favorite, but everything I have had here is great.   If you are looking for a relaxed, authentic Italian lunch or dinner are Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird this is the place to go!

I had heard great things about this place and was very excited to try it. All of the food is really fresh and good quality, and is prepared perfectly. Their iced BC coffee is delicious and I am not even a big coffee drinker. The bacon is perfect and their sandwiches are delicious on bread or a bagel.   The service is great and extremely quick. They get you what you need and are fast.  Awesome place and I recommend it for breakfast or lunch!

They don't allow for online ordering and did not pick up the phone when I called in the order. Either they are shut down or they are the worst Domino's Pizza I have ever encountered.

Mastro's has the best steaks I have had in Arizona. Their quality is outstanding and their side dishes are great as well. Seafood is excellent and I have never had something here that I don't enjoy.  The bar area has a great live band and is an awesome place to relax and enjoy a drink or dinner as well.   The price is much higher than most places, but the experience and quality makes it well worth it.

First time here in a few years and very disappointed. I saw it was all you can eat fish & chips which sounded perfect, but in over an hour the waitress came back one with only 1 piece of fish. I would have loved to have more but didn't want to wait another hour. Great place if you aren't hungry or thirsty and don't mind killing a few hours just sitting around I guess.

We had a group of 3 and started with the grilled calamari. I was used to fried calamari, so when I saw the plate of grilled squid with capers come out I was a little questionable. It was the best calamari I have ever eaten! Delicious taste and I would recommend it to everyone. Their drinks are amazing and definitely not watered down.  My first drink was the Illegalito which had a Mojito taste, but a sweeter finish. Not overly sweet, but just enough to counter the mint. Raspberry and Rio was my second drink and it was a great blend of fresh berries and alcohol. I have the 10oz center cut filet of beef and it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked to order and the fingerling potatoes were a great compliment. My roommate got the crab stuffed shrimp and I sampled that. It was like having one of the best crab cakes I have ever eaten with a shrimp outside. My girlfriend got the Mediterranean chicken and that was also very good. Great blend of ingredients and she mentioned it was not overly filling as most pasta dishes can be. If you want a ton of food and are on a budget this is probably not the place for you, but if you want delicious food that is a perfect portion, an awesome variety of drinks, and don't mind paying slightly more to get it Tanzy is the place!

Both Stingray locations are great, but this is by far my favorite. The view from the patio isn't as nice as the Old Town Scottsdale location, but the food seems to be prepared slightly better and you can't beat the happy hour drinks, roll, and food specials.   I always spend more than I intend to, but it is always worth it! Great after work spot for happy hour or early dinner.

This is the newest place I have found and it is very close to me.   They mail out coupons and that brought us in. Their pizza is amazing! Great quality and excellent taste. We went on a Thursday and they had happy hour specials on drinks. They were also great and all 3 of us enjoyed our beverages.   We had a buy one, get one coupon and used it for pizza and pasta. The pasta was just okay, but the pizza, drinks, atmosphere, and server made up for it.   Great restaurant at a reasonable price.

I drove by this place many times, but the name "tavern" made me think of $1 PBRs and greasy bar food. This place was NOTHING like that! The beers are quality and they have a good craft beer selection as well. The food was neither greasy nor disgusting, but delicious and they even had healthier options. Happy hour was a great deal, and the food was fantastic. Their philly steak slider with wiz was better than most cheesesteak places. The pizza is thin crust and would probably cost double at other places. We wanted to sample a variety of food so we also ordered a steak with loaded mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The macaroni was bowtie and one of the best macaroni dishes I have had anywhere. The potatoes were great and the steak was cooked perfectly. Great surprise and this is my new "spot" for quick, delicious meals and once football starts. It is more of a N Scottsdale feel in that area and a much nicer and cleaner environment than most bars.
