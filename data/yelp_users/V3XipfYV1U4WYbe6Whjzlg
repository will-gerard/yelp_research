Today I took a group of school children today to the Herberger Theater to see the production of The Little Mermaid.   I have been here once before (also with a group of children) and they are very helpful.  Upon reaching the theater we were welcomed and were given a parking permit so our bus could sit outside.  The usher, who greeted us, quickly brought us inside and spoke to my group about the theater's expectations and gave directions on what to to and where to go.   I've never been her on my own accord (other than field trips) but I wouldn't miss the chance to come back.

I've been to Talking Stick for many different events. I love watching the Suns and the Mercury play here, I am planning on seeing the Rattlers play in the next few weeks, I've seen the circus here, and a Cirque de Soleil show here as well. I haven't been to a concert here, but I'm sure it's a great venue.

I am really enjoying that Sakana has a great menu and a small menu of particular types of rolls.  My husband doesn't "love" sushi, but he likes Sakana and I think it's great that both he and I can get a couple of rolls and be satisfied. I am looking forward to the next time I will visit Sakana. That's how you know a place is great!

Mr. C and I met a friend at this restaurant a few weeks ago for happy hour in the bar area. We ordered the calamari, the sliders and the mussels and clam dish.   I really enjoyed the seafood dishes. They were very good.  In fact, the whole table was dipping bread the leftover sauce! (Yum!)    I personally didn't care for the sliders, but my husband gobbled them up!    The reason I'm totally my rating at four stars is because the group that played that night was terrible. Honestly, I felt like I was being standoffish to the rest of my party because I couldn't hear my husband who was sitting next to me, let alone our friend's friends who sat across the table!  Another thing that bothered me is that this group didn't have a solid repertoire.  One moment they're playing Beatles (which they butchered) then they played "Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting."  (SERIOUSLY!? At an Italian restaurant???)  Because we met our friend for happy hour, we plan to return another time and use our restaurant.com coupon, and sit in the dining room rather than the bar.

Of course I'm a fan of Starbucks!  I like this location because of the long table with ample plugs as well as the bar with plugs as well.  I wish all Starbucks were this accomodating!  I guess it helps being next to the college!! I'm two stars away from my gold card! I sure am coming back, maybe not to this location, but I will be seeing star(buck)s in my future!

I've visited here a few times over the summer with a group of children and I am honestly very happy with the facilities and the lifeguards.  Previously I was not impressed by the maturity of the guards but I've had a few incidences this summer where they have been quite attentive towards my schoolchildren and myself.  This is my favorite Chandler pool that my group visits regularly. I like that it is only one pool which makes watching children easier.

Normally when my husband and I visit Valle Luna we split an order of the fajitas and order the queso dip. Last night we had a buy one get one free coupon so we got separate orders.  They were pretty much was the same thing except I got the smothered burrito and he got the enchiladas. I thought that the meat was a little spicy for me but I still ate it. The burrito skin was not warm at all and it was pretty dry. My husbands enchiladas looked better than my dish!  Also I ordered guacamole with mine-$2.50!   I'm sure we'll come back, but next time I'm ordering the fajitas and queso dip!!!

I've only been here with school groups and I am very happy with my experiences. The manager is very welcoming and constantly check on myself and my kids that I bring to make sure that we are happy and to make sure if we need anything. I think out of my 10 or so experiences at USA Skateland Chandler I've only had one negative experience (can't remember why or what happened)  but all my other experiences make up for the one time.    If I personally knew how to skate I would definitely visit more often.

I have visited a Flemings a few times over the years and I am always satisfied.  I usually go with my husband's family on Sundays to take advantage of their Prime Rib deal.  I always enjoy visiting.  They always have great steaks and amazing sides.  I haven't been for happy hour but I heard it's pretty good.

Even with a coupon this place is expensive. I didn't realize until afterwards that their lox is pretty pricey.  I could've gone to Einstein Bagels and paid half of what I paid here WITHOUT A COUPON!!!!

Took some kids that I babysit here. For a medium pizza (which looked more like a personal pan) and a half plate of spaghetti, it sure was expensive and gross!  The location on Warner is better!  The pizza was way to cheesy and gave me a stomach ache later.  The pasta was just disgusting.  I'm glad I wasn't the one who ordered it but the 6 year old didn't seem to notice. I won't be going back. :/

I wasn't expecting much when I came here for lunch but, boy, I was happy I did.  I bought a chicken pot pie and it was the best pot pie I've ever had!  The service here is good too.  I'll be returning on more lunch breaks!!!

I went to Autonation Tempe Hyundai.  The sales person that greeted me was friendly at the beginning and during the test drive.  But we we started to negotiate, he became  very rude, abrasive and threw a temper tantrum. Horrible customer service. I understand price negotiation takes a while but him yelling at us was just completely rude.  I walked out and left.

Bought a groupon for $11 and came here for the dinner buffet.  My husband and I were not impressed.  First I have to preface by saying I don't know much about Indian food.  My husband and I prefer a couple restaurants closer to us, closer to Chandler.  The food here was way too salty and bland.  I tried the desserts and they were way to sweet AND I have a sweet tooth!  We will probably not come back here even though the cashier gave us a coupon and mentioned that there is another coupon on Living Social.

Today I saw Ken for the second time. The first time he put highlights into my hair, which I loved, and today I came back to trim my original style and get a little bit more of a dramatic cut.  I love the style and I am coming back to Fantastic Sams.

Big fat Greek restaurant great place to some great food. My husband and I love big fat because it is cheap and we always use restaurant.com gift cards. Our favorites are the meat kebabs and I like the gyros and beef pasta dishes.  Alcoholic drinks are not that expensive either.

My friend and I walked in and we were told that their systems were down and it would take about five minutes. We weren't really bothered, and decided to wait for them to be up and running.   Once they were done we both decided to order a quesadilla each.  There was a younger boy and and another guy in in his 20's working behind the counter.  Both of them were super slow while preparing our meals.  The younger guy was quite literally the slowest person I've ever had serve me, with no sense of urgency. As my friend's quesadilla was being made by the older boy, she had questions about her meal and the guy behind the counter was rude to her.  A few times he responded and she asked him to repeat himself and he seemed upset. His whole demeanor was as if he didn't want us there at all. I understand that they might have been slow because they were waiting on an ingredient, but neither of the two ever said that. The two behind the counter seemed like they didn't know what they were doing either.  After they finally finished preparing our quesadillas the manager came out and said that the machine to cook the quesadilla would take about 20 minutes to complete, and that because of their systems being down our meals would be on them. We decided since their machines were down and we had only half of our orders that we would come back to pick them up in a few minutes.   Of course, we had to wait for them to make another couple of quesadillas for us with the same crappy service.  (I understand their reasoning for making another one - food-born illness and letting food get too warm or too cold)   We found out after receiving our lunch that all Qdobos are closing their doors in a short amount of time, but that shouldn't negate even the smallest amount of service.  The manager was the only person in that restaurant who actually cared about her customers. I wish her well after the closing of this store, but I have to give this location only two stars based on the horrible customer service of the two guys behind the counter, and the fact that they comped our meal.

I just came from here and I wish  read the negative reveiews.   Service is a joke.  The lady who sat me down asked what color I wanted. I wanted "white" (but more of a shell color I pointed to)  Then a man comes up and asks me what color I want. Of course I said "white" and he begins to paint my nails. The lady who originally asked me what color is sitting next to him helping another customer. (Why ask me if you'll be with another customer??) After he's finished with painting my nails she realizes that he is painting my nails white-out white and starts yelling at him. I told her it was okay, because honestly I didn't care. I would've stopped him if I did.  Either way, It was kind of a cold atmosphere the best thing about my experience was that Sharknado was on their tv.  (Yea - that was the best thing!)   Besides getting gel polish, I could've had a friend do it for about $20 cheaper.  Not going here again. I'm going back to Nicole at Riposa Salon.

Phoenix Palace is a favorite in my family.  This is definitely on our rotation of Chinese food. Usually we come for dim sum and the food is always good.  Of course the ambiance is not beautiful but the food definitely makes up for that.

I don't think I'll be going back if I can help it.  I work with children and I wanted to pull my hair out at this place.  About 100 kids running around falling against each other.  No thank you!   Maybe it's my fault for going during dinner time on a Saturday night.

A good place to go for a heavy handed margarita and some bland-gross burritos and super slow service.   My husband and I came here for the living social pre-fix menu. We each ordered a margarita, both ways. I got the frozen one and it is so strong I felt tipsy after a few sips. We also ordered the poco chimis which weren't that bad.  Then out come out main dishes.  My husband had the combo with a burrito and an enchilada, and I had the grande burrito. We both noticed that the burros had too much skin and made the burrito dry. After doing some "food surgery" by peeling the top layer back and taking off the second layer, the burrito was better but not much of an improvement.  We also ordered the fried ice cream which was probably the best part of the meal.  Sad, isn't it?  Needless to say, we won't be coming back here.

Who doesn't love Costco!?  Awesome items, great prices and helpful staff!  We've been shopping here for years. I really like that if a product breaks you can return it for your money back!  We had a Dyson vacuum cleaner that was beginning to give us some trouble so we returned it and got our money back. Once we returned a water reservoir back pack because the bladder was leaking and we were able to exchange it for a new one.

I enjoyed myself at Donovan's. The atmosphere is really nice and he food was good.  Granted this is my first experience with a fancy steakhouse other than Flemmings. We sat in a room that had some sports memorabilia on the wall which was very classy.  I ordered the filet mignonette with bacon wrapped scallops. I really liked my food.  I wouldn't mind retiring to celebrate a special occasion.

YUM!!! (and I don't like sandwiches!!)  I actually found out about Great Harvest from a kid that goes to the school I work at. I was really curious because every time he had a Great Harvest sandwich it piqued my interest!   Since then, I have been to the Great Harvest restaurant/store a few times with my husband.  All of the sandwiches I've had there are great. My favorite bread is the Dakota bread.   Yesterday (6/9/16) I visited Legoland Discovery Center and I was happy to see that they had sandwiches from Great Harvest.

My husband and I ordered our food online tonight and when I went to the restaurant they had no knowledge of my order being placed.  I figured my husband might have not submitted the order, but he swears he did. It really didn't bother me too much, because I understand that there can be technical hiccups every once and a while. So I ordered our food and waited patiently for it to be ready.  I got home and I wasn't particularly happy with what it looked like. I ordered the Biana Pasta, the Berry Salad, and an order of wings.  I have to say  that my husband's salad looked pretty good, but I just wasn't in the mood for salad.  My pasta wasn't very good. I could have made a better dish from store bought pasta and sauce.  We ordered the maple wings and they had a weird taste and the chicken was quite rubbery.    Our meal came to about $40, and I'm glad that we had a $20 off coupon. Had I been dining in the restaurant I would've asked for my money back.  I will not be dining here again and I will not tell anyone to go here based on the bland pasta and wings.

I've always enjoyed eating at Kabuki.  I always order the salmon skin rolls (my typical order).  Last night I ordered The Kabuki Roll, which is an assortment of sushi and I was pleasantly surprised.  The dish's description says that they are spicy crunch rolls, and I am not a fan of spicy sushi, but there were only a couple pieces that were spicy.  (Ate those first!)   I would definitely order the Kabuki Roll again.  Also, I ordered the onigiri, which was also good.   I have also ordered the seafood udon in the past. I'll be back soon!

This is the third time I've reviewed Teharu, and each time I go I feel this place has progressively gotten worse. I imagine that bugs taste better than this place.  The service here is absolutely horrible. My husband and I came in around 2/2:30 today (Sunday) and waited 15-20 minutes while a waiter spoke on the phone before we were seated. Not to mention, no one acknowledged us upon entering, or sitting for a few minutes. The sushi here tastes too sweet, and very rubbery.  I don't like grocery store sushi, but I've had WAY better sushi across the street at AJ's.    I refuse to dine here.  I'd rather spend $4-6 on a California roll elsewhere.

My husband and I love going to this place.  He gets the jerk chicken and I get the thai chicken.  I like to experiment with different smoothies, my guy usually gets anything with strawberry.   My husband has a packet of coupons he gets every so often from his work and most of the time we use those, or find them in newspapers.    I think $5 for a smoothie that is going to last me 5 minutes is a lot, but it's worth every dollar.  :)  Now I'm craving a smoothie!!!

I love Tropical Smoothie.  I always stop in when I'm nearby!  My favorite has to be the Peanut Paradise. It has peanut butter, banana, yogurt and a mix in.  I'm not a fan of certain fruits in a smoothie so this one is perfect for me!  If I stop in during the morning it usually keeps me going throughout till lunchtime, and it's also the perfect desert!

What can't you say about As You Wish? They've got it all!  I enjoy coming here with my friend. We  see it as a stress reliever!  It's a great place to just sit and chill out. All of the staff are very friendly and very helpful.  The atmosphere at this store is awesome.  My friend and I have remarked that even the music they play is a nice mix of music, and it's upbeat and fun and keeps you motivated.  It's a place that I wouldn't mind taking kids while babysitting and at the same time taking a group of girls for a girls night out.  I've even seen groups of people come in and have a drink while their painting (I'd double check store policies before just bringing in that merlot!)     I really like that they have the option of painting pottery, as well as working with glass.  The glass is super easy for adults and pretty fun too! (Bring a pair of tweezers if you're using glass, it's easier than trying to pick up tiny pieces with your fingers!) I bet I've spent hundreds here, and I know I'll be spending more!

Since writing my last review they have taken away the glass. (Sad day) but they are trying to add more fun ways to paint.  Tonight I took the new glaze class and it was pretty fun and I can't wait to get my piece back. Probably going back again this weekend to make another piece for a gift!!!  I've seriously thought about getting a part time summer job here!  I love this place!!!

I ordered to go here upon the request of the ladies I work with. I was surprised that the sushi was pretty good. Not a bad price for good sushi. I would rather go here than the rotating sushi place down the street. I also ordered tempura udon. It was pretty good for takeout. I would go back.  I like that they have other options too so I can take my husband who doesn't like sushi. :)

I sold my car here a few months back.  No haggle, no headaches. Very pleased with the easy process.  My husband just sold his car this week to CarMax!  I don't plan on going there again, (Due to the fact that we both have newish cars) but I would reccomend anyone looking into selling a car to go here.

Great place.  Wish I could have ordered some more.   I was surprised that they had goeyduck. (Wanted to order this, but didn't census I don't know if my family would've liked it.) I also wanted to try frog legs, but not at $18 a plate, again especially if my family didn't eat it.  I'd go back with just my husband to get something else.

Awesome pool. I go here every summer on my own as well as with a group of children.    I like that this pool has ample chairs to sit around the kiddie area so I could watch my kids.  What I DON'T like is that the lifeguards are all clueless.  There are times when we'd be sitting in the shallow end and almost get knocked down by kids who were fighting in the area. We even mentioned it to the lifeguards on duty and they don't seem to care.

So my 50 minute massage ended up being about 40 minutes.  Even though I used a Groupon I expect to get what I am owed.  It's common courtesy to call your clients and just mention "Hey we've moved! Here's our address, don't be late, we're booked up that day and don't want you to miss out on your full massage!"  ---------------------------------- I just got back from a "50 minute" hot stone massage and I am pretty upset.    First off, I must say the massage itself was not bad and had my experience been better I would return.   So I got to my appointment a few minutes early at 845 E Warner Rd.  The door was locked so I sat in my car for a few minutes until my appointment time.   After getting out of my car a second time, I noticed that the business was closed and had a for sale sign above the company's signage. (That's on me for not noticing)  When I called the company they explained that they had moved and gave me directions. I understood that the new location was close.  I put in the address they gave me for the new location and my gps gave me a place that was way north.  So I tried to look for the "golf pro shop" that was close by since the receptionist mentioned it being in that plaza. I couldn't find anything on the gps but decided to head west and try the closest plaza. It happened to be the plaza they were in, but I still couldn't find "The Body Shop Massage and Day Spa" anywhere.  I drove the whole plaza and I couldn't find it so I had to call again.  I was told that it was "next to" the thrift store, so I parked and got out to go inside. To the right of the thrift store is a day care and to the left is a bunch of empty shops followed by a dental office. After going inside the  thrift shop and asking for help I was told that it was actually next to the dental office. When I got there I noticed that "The Body Shop" was not on the front entrance but "Paris."  After entering the shop, my masseuse asked me if I knew that I was late which really upset me and I had to tell her that I couldn't' find the place. She said she was booked up all day and that she could only give me 5 minutes "extra" and she'd make sure that she did everything.   Like I said the massage was pretty standard, and I wasn't sure what to expect since I had never had a hot stone massage. I don't know if I'd want to return here or not. Based on them not calling me to tell me that they've moved - I don't think they want my business.

I went with a group of coworkers after a long training nearby.  I've been here before but I don't remember my experience with it.  Your first impression of this place is that it's nice with it's decor.  I ordered water since I was with a boss.  The water tastes like fish swam in it. Yuck. I reordered a Coke.  $2.50!  When that came out, that tasted like stale, bitter and really flat Coke.  We told the lady and she later brought us another soda, which tasted better but still bitter.  (Clean your machine!!!)  I ordered a #2 lunch combo which was one cheese enchilada and two shredded beef taquitos served with rice and beans.  My coworker ordered a #1 but had them make her enchilada a chicken. She seemed to like hers much better than I did mine.  My enchilada tasted like they just wrapped two mozzarella sticks with a corn tortilla and the taquitos were absolutely tasteless.  The best part of the dish was the rice and beans. Yuck.   I wish that we had gone somewhere else, but we figured since it was a couple doors down from the hotel it would be easier for all of us.  :/

I used to not like Jimmy Johns until my husband asked to go there one night.  The first time I visited Jimmy Johns I had a tuna slim, and I wasn't a fan.  When I went with my husband this time around I ordered the beach club with sprouts, and I'm a fan.  I've ordered JJ's at least once since coming a few weeks ago.  I even have them in my contacts list on my cell phone!

Best Noodles In Town!!!  I love China Magic Noodle so much that when people ask for a good Chinese restaurant I always tell them China Magic Noodle!  A few people that I have told about this restaurant have come back to me telling me how good it was.  The noodles are so delicious you will not be disappointed. I like that you can watch the chef make the noodles through the window. Because they're freshly made in house the noodles tend to be long, which I like.  The wait staff is very attentive too.   You won't be disappointed!

Yummy Food!  Came here with my family yesterday for dinner and I was very pleased with our food. Though I don't know the American names we had what one could amount to as a feast! Chicken, Duck, Beef, Soup, Fried Tofu and more! If you like Chinese food this is a great place to visit.  I've never had the buffet, but would love to given the opportunity!

To me this is a basic noodle place.  It was pretty good but nothing really stood out to me as being "the best" or a stand out dish. My noodle dish was pretty good though it has lots of coriander, which I hate.  My husband likes this place so I'm going to rate it 4 stars.

My husband and I ate here Friday and we were impressed.  I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and this place was spicy!  (But that's a good thing!)  We bought a groupon for this restaurant, and we've decided to buy another one!   We shall be returning!

A co-worker and I were hungry last Thursday and decided to order from Lucy's. We were really happy about everything. We both ordered a breakfast burrito and we were satisfied with the food as well as the price .  We are going back to try the lunch soon!

My husband and I stopped into Corner Bakery Cafe before an event last night and the two of us are split on our decisions if we like the place.  I ordered the Steak and Cheese Hoagie and he ordered the Roast Beef and Cheddar Sandwich.  We ordered our sandwiches to go because we were't sure if we'd have enough time to sit and eat or if we'd have to walk and eat.    -My husbands roast beef and cheddar sandwich was not very appetizing.  The sandwich was basically a ciabatta loaf with a few slices of roast beef and lettuce and tomato, and very dry.  He said it was something that he could've made, but better.   By the time we realized they had mustard and mayo by the drinks we were on our way out. He literally ate 1/3 of the whole sandwich.  -However, My steak and cheese hoagie was pretty good, I thought. It had caramelized mushrooms, onions and red peppers. (I might add it traveled well!)   Given the chance to return, I probably would but my husband would not.  Therefore, I am giving Corner Bakery Cafe only 2 stars.

Came here with a Groupon to see Jurassic World.  We got our tickets about an hour before showtime and our seats were up front to the left. I thought I'd hate th seats, but they weren't bad actually.   My husband and I ordered the 2 for $25 meal which includes one appetizer and two entrees.   We ordered the nachos for our app and a meat pizza and a chicken quesadilla.   The food was phenomenal.  I really enjoyed the nachos.  We even had some to take home!   Great sound, great screen, great food, clean facilities. 5 Stars!

My family and I came here because my sister-in-law wanted to try it. I'm glad we did.  I think we bought about seven dishes and nine of us were able to share them all.  I definitely would visit again.

Eh. Not really "Authentic Chinese Cuisine"  like the sign indicated.  Although we had a coupon, I would have still rather have paid full price for a meal elsewhere.   Probably a good place for people who think that Panda Express is "real" Chinese food.

I absolutely love Crêpe Bar. My favorite is the maple crepe with bananas and bacon.   I also enjoy the vanilla crêpe. Basically any of the sweet crapes are good. My husband likes the breakfast burrito type crepes.    If you plan on going on a Sunday make sure you have lots of time because the restaurant is small but, the wait is worth it. If the wait is long usually they give out things like yogurt or oatmeal as sort of an appetizer.

My husband and I haven't visited for a while until just recently.  A few weeks ago I ordered the lemon curd crepe and it was great.  Today we visited and I ordered the Rose Marshmallow.  Oh! My! Goodness! I was on cloud 9. I love marshmallows and Nutella so this dish was amazing.    The price per crepe is not bad either. My only complaint is that I don't like their coffee, but that's only a small gripe!

My husband and I have been here a couple times and we've enjoyed it. I like that you can customize your soup however you want. There are certain ingredients that I don't care for my soup and I like that I can check off that I don't want them also that I can add double meat. The soups come with a drink of choice I believe it's milk tea, coffee, and regular tea; Hot or iced.  I will definitely return

Service is horrible today. My husband received his bowl about 7-10 minutes ago before I had mine. I was never offered a refill on my milk tea or offered water.

I came here tonight with a friend about thirty minutes before closing, had we known we would be rudely asked to leave AT closing we would have gone elsewhere. A sufficient five minute notice would have been great, but the lady rudely interrupted our conversation and said that they were closed, and then asked if we needed to go containers.  I will NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore.  I'll spend an extra few $$ and go back to Kabuki.  RUDE!

We came here with a Groupon and I have to say that this sushi was average. My husband who doesn't like sushi even mentioned a place that has better sushi. I probably wouldn't come back based on the food.  The restaurant seems clean and has a nice atmosphere, that's why I'm giving it 3 stars- an average rating.   10/24/14 Update: I came back with another groupin and the sushi was still average and the beef teriyaki was nothing special. We're sitting next to three teppan tables which haven't been cleaned and there's still gunk on the grill top.  Yuck.

We've been a few times to Mika's Grill and we haven't been disappointed.  Usually we order gyro or chicken and with the sides it's just enough food to fill us up.  I would recommend Mika's to anyone.  Very Good!

Saigon Pho.  My favorite!  My husband and I love this place.  I always get the #2 (Summer rolls) and #41 (seafood rice noodle)  YUM!  My Mr. C always gets the beef salad (not sure of number) which is also great.   My sister in law and father in law always get the #10 pho. (I haven't had it yet)  I decided to switch it up and get  Bun this time.  Bun is sort of a noodle salad dish and is great!!  I've NEVER been disappointed by Saigon!

This place is STRICT! That is because they want their butterflies to thrive.  Before going in with a group of kids they sat us down and gave us very rigid instructions on how to walk and act in the butterfly habitat.  They enforced that if one child didn't follow the rules then the whole group would be asked to leave! Luckily my kids did great and we all had a good time.   It starts with the 4D movie about a butterflies life.  Very cute movie.  Then you are shown how Butterfly Wonderland receives their stock. (We were able to see a worker add some new butterflies)  After that, you are brought into the observatory.  If you want butterflies to land on you wear bright colors!  You are instructed to walk slowly and to not touch butterflies with your hands. This is a beautiful area and I would suggest early in the morning because it gets very humid.  After the butterfly habitat there's a cafe and then the room with the aquariums and rays.  Once you're finished with the sea life you are lead back to the front inside the gift shop.    I enjoyed my trip to Butterfly Wonderland, and I know my schoolkids did too! We'd come back on another field trip.

I came here last night with a girlfriend and we were not too happy with our waiter.  He was way too pushy and got out order wrong.  We asked for an oil based pizza with salami and several types of cheese and one side with mushrooms.  The only part of the pizza that was correct was the mushrooms. Also he kept asking me if he could refill my SmartWater bottle.  That's just weird....  I Like Mellow Mushroom, so I have to give it 4 stars but I will try to avoid this waiter or go to the Mill location instead.

Who doesn't like waking up at 3 am because someone downstairs in the casino tripped the fire alarm!?!? Not me!  I was not happy that we were awoken and once downstairs they told us to return to our rooms.  Also, it's little too industrial for my style.  The room looked like we were staying in a construction zone.

I did not enjoy my experience   The breakfast menu isn't too big. My husband ordered the special burrito and I ordered biscuits and gravy and a cup of coffee.  My biscuits came first.  They looked okay but were really salty and not to my liking -2 stars (one for each biscuit)  My husbands special burrito came. (Don't remember the name, top of the menu) I tried his dish and it was super dry, no flavor and bland. -1 star.

I've been here 3 times already and I love this place!!  A staple of mine at a Japanese restaurants are salmon skin rolls. I've had that every time I've been there and it's pretty good. Every so often I also like to order tempura udon and here it is just amazing. I like that their happy hour ends at 6:30 because I get off at six and work not too far away. They also have a small bites menu that my friend and I have ordered from. I haven't ordered any alcoholic beverages, but I will be returning and probably soon!

Gelato on a stick can't be all that bad!!  Not a bad little place to get a sweet.  Service was okay, though the counter girl was a little snippy. I hope to see a business like this soon in Phoenix.

We came here a couple weekends ago for brunch. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the food.  My husband got the ot style Benedict and I got what they call the ménage: a basic egg, meat, pancake plate.   I enjoyed my food and I even liked my husbands.  I wouldn't mind coming back.  :)

I visited tonight with my husband. He ordered a burger while I ordered the chicken; we both got the BBQ M&O.  I bought a combo so we also received fries and a drink.   The order itself took about 20 to 25 minutes to arrive at our table. I wish it wasn't so long but it's worth the wait.  My husband liked his burger and I enjoyed my chicken.  Since we ordered the same thing I asked my husband if he wanted half of mine and I could take half of his.  I'm not a huge burger fan but I liked it.  I believe this is our third time at this restaurant and I would gladly come backf

Stopped in the other day to give my ears and head a break from the BBQ festival, and my husband and I shared a mocha. It was pretty good. I definitely want to go back and try it again.

I am pretty upset that I waited 1.5 hours to pick up my tickets for tonight's show. Another show-goer just happened to look on the Laugh Factory's Facebook page which said that the club was closed for repairs.  There were no signs on the door or anything indicating that the establishment was  closed. Poor Business.  Too bad, I was really looking forward to the show.

Came here with my husband a few weeks ago and we both ordered burgers. I'm not a burger fan but I really didn't joy myself at the district as well as my burger.  We both had a shake which was really good.  I checked in on Yelp's website and was able to use the offer of a one cent draft drink. I ordered an IPA which I normally don't like but it was an orange flavour and was pretty good!   The location was a little hard to find but once we got there we were curious about the pool outside.  I think if I were 10 years younger, I probably would like this place more!

COME HUNGRY!  I ordered the American Breakfast, which is two eggs that comes with two choices of potatoes or fruit as well as a meat of choice, and toast, biscuit or a muffin. I ordered my eggs sunny side up with corned beef hash and a biscuit.  I am not a huge fan of corn beef, but something was telling me to change my original order from bacon to corned beef. I'm glad I did, it was the best I've ever had.  My eggs were pretty standard and the home fries were actually scalloped potatoes and pretty good. I also had a biscuit.    My family ordered dishes like an omelette, french toast, a waffle and the tiki toast. I didn't try any of theirs but it really looked good.  The portions are pretty big, so if you don't have much of an appetite you could share!

I went with my husband today - my second time, his first.   I ordered the chili cheese dog and it was amazing!  I really like that it was less than $4 and if I was any more hungrier I couldn't gotten two for a pretty good price.  My husband ordered a steak and cheese on croissant roll which looked pretty good.  He did say he wished they had chopped up the peppers, but I'm sure they'd gladly cut them if he asked.  We'll definitely be back soon!

Field Trip Review, Right Here!!  Came here on a Thursday afternoon with a group of 22 children.  I previously checked Yelp since I haven't visited before which I am glad I did! The place is HUGE!   Height Requirement:  On our trip, like I said we had 22 children and about 7 under the height requirement for the two rides. In order for children under 4 ft to ride they must be with an adult. Children over 4 ft can ride without an adult.  Luckily one of our friends from school was with his grandma, and she helped us be a third adult for the kids under the height requirement. My advice is to be aware of your kids who are younger/shorter and make a plan. Each ride is about 5-7 minutes long not including wait times.   Mini-Phoenix:  Once you've gone on the first ride you are led into the mini Phoenix made of legos. It is pretty awesome! I was very excited to see this room and was equally excited that the lights changed from day to night!   Legoland Discovery:   Out of Mini-Phoenix is the wonder of Legoland Discovery Center. Here's where you'll see the other ride in the corner (same advice for you as previously mentioned), and all the other play areas.   4D Movie:   The movie theater was not working yesterday (6/9), something about the track holding the seats were not moving properly. (Not sure if that was the actual reason) Honestly I would have liked to have seen the 4D movie and many of my little friends were sad they couldn't see it.  My Overall Reaction:  Going into this field trip I was a little nervous about it, but all in all I really enjoyed myself and I believe my 22 campers did as well.  I told my director that we all liked this field trip, so I'm pretty sure we'll be back on another break.  ---that being said I would like to say that I would bring children individually.  At $22 a person, it is a bit steep, but I think it's well worth it if your kids love legos and if you spend more than an hour there.

My husband and I stopped into the formerly Paradise Bakery now known as Panera Bread.  I'm pretty sure they're owned by the same company because not much has changed, even the menu. What I do like about Panera over Paradise is that we do not have to stand in a long line (sometimes) and wait for our food to arrive. Now they give you a pager and they bring your food to you.   It is the same exceptional food and service given as Paradise. I'm a fan!
