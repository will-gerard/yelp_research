I love this work out! I attended a karve studio in scottsdale with friends as part of an excersise exploration class. I fell in love with this work out. I found out they had a studio in Gilbert not to far from my house. I was super excited to go sign up and since I love it so much I was going to buy a one month membership for each managment staff on my team. Money in hand I headed to the studio. I walked in and a few girls talking no one greeted me. I looked around at the items for sale and waited still no one even acknowledged I was standing there. I waited for the lady behind the desk to say something and they all acted like I was a ghost. No greeting nothing not even a half snile. I put my karve socks I was going to purchase back waited to make sure they saw me and then decided if no one could at least say hello I didn't want to spend my money there. Very, very disappointed!!! I'm not sure if its because they aren't use to african American women walking in their studio but I'm very disappointed. But I will try ballet fusion

I am so happy and blessed to have found someone to not only braid my hair but care for my hair. My hair was breaking off in the middle and not healthy. Everytime I take my braids out after she does it, my hair has grown. I get the best compliments when I get my hair done and unlike many others  here in the valley, everything is professional, comfortable, clean and quick. I won't let anyone else touch my hair.
