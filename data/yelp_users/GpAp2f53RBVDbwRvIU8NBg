It's used to be a good place to get sushi. Until I ate sushi at KABUKI Tempe, this place is far behind. Sorry I'm not a fan anymore to this place, till I stopped by to get lunch. The salmon wasn't fresh. 2 star...

I used to work here and served table. Now I'm enjoying myself having a dinner at Buca. Linguine frutti de mar still the best and my fav dish so far.

I've been to this restaurant few times when I visit my friend in south mountain. They have pretty good food, even my son loves their orange chicken.

This is the only Philippine's Restaurant in Phoenix that you can find the best Chicken Adobo, Lumpia Shanghai, Bihon and Halo2 dessert. Very nice service and friendly restaurant owner, Tony. They have tons of fresh bakery too... yum! and yum! I wish my mom has bakery store like them.

It's award Winning Pizzeria Place I've ever been. The Tiramisu is a killer, better than Buca Di Beppo as said too by the owner. Even my house is far in Surprise, I will sure come back for more pizza. the owner was very nice and humble. Thank you Stefano.. here's a FIVE STAR. You deserved it.
