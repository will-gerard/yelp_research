This was my first time at this restaurant. Everything was great; the food, service, and the atmosphere. I ordered the Fillet Mignon and it was perfect. The mashed potatoes were the best I've had yet. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. It was nice to see the manager on duty walking around and talking with the customers. I will definetley be back again.

Lived across the street from here for almost 10 years and never thought to stop in. Well, last night i visited for the 1st time with a group of Girl Scout moms. WOW! I've been missing out! Lets start with the atmosphere. It felt cozy, decor was gorgeous, and everyone was so friendly. Now the food/drinks. We were able to sample the salads, ziti, meatballs, and several different pizzas. This was original italian food. All of it was amazing. The selection of wine was gigantic! Our group was over 20 people and I didn't hear 1 complaint.  I will definitely be going back.

I have been coming here off and on since they opened. I love the atmosphere and the decor. Its very clean and big. The staff is all super friendly. Recently went in for a pedi and mani on seperate occassions. I was a walk-in both times after work during the week and they were able to take me right away. I was out of there both times in under an hour. They have so many options for polish and gel, you will not be disappointed. I highly suggest you check this place out!

Brought in my 11 year old daughter to get a haircut.  While the service was fast and the girl did a great job giving her the cut she wanted,  I wasnt very pleased with the professionalism.  The stylist were talking across the floor about going out and getting drunk the night before. I'm sorry but I don't feel that is appropriate when you have clients around,  especially a little girl.

Came in last night for the first time for a friend's birthday dinner.  We had reservations for 7pm. They had our table ready as soon as we got there. They even had a little card ready for the birthday girl.  Ambiance was nice, loved the table and wall decor. Ordered the hummus appetizer and the filet mignon. Everything was delicious. Had a little carmel machiatto dessert which was the perfect end to the dinner. Our waitress, I believe Karen was her name,  was super sweet and very attentive. Thank you for a great 1st experience!

Stopped here on our way back to Phoenix from Flagstaff to catch the Cardinals game.  Found it on Yelp. Glad we did. Perfect neighborhood sports bar atmosphere.  Our server Aaron was awesome!  He was attentive and never took long to fulfill any request.  I had a ceaser salad, teriyaki wings and pretzel apps. All tasted great! Perfect spot for a party of 8 including a baby. Patio looked large with corn hole to help entertain.  Definitely a place worth checking out!

A friend decided to have her birthday shindig here and I have to say it was a great choice.  We had a party of 20 something including kids, so the space alone was nice to have. Everyone stayed entertained whether it was sitting in the comfy chairs/couches chatting away or playing a little cornhole and ping pong. We were there at least 5 hrs and I wouldn't have minded staying longer if I had the time.  Our server Britney was amazing! She was on top of it the entire time and super friendly.  Our entire group kept saying how great the service was. Not just Britney, but everyone helping her deliver everything we ordered. Will  definitely be back and will recommend to everyone! Thank s for a great experience!!

Had to bring my daughter in on a Friday evening after she injured herself at volleyball practice. (My Dr office was already closed for the weekend) And we had a follow up visit on Monday.  I was very pleased with the entire staff I dealt with on both occasions. Our follow up appointment for Monday was scheduled at 11am. Come 1155 we still hasn't seen the Dr. (I guess that is to be expected at a walk in urgent care.) We ended up leaving since i had to get back to work but told them we'd be back after i got off. They got us right in and even gave my daughter a gift card to Cold Stone for the wait earlier(thought that was a nice touch) all in all I would definitely recommend coming here.

Came here on Sunday morning with friends for our first time.  It wasn't too busy so we got seated pretty quick.  Entire staff was friendly and I never caught them just standing around. The food was amazing! I had the traditional french toast,  bacon,  and breakfast potatoes. I think that was the best french toast I've ever had. I will definitely be back!
