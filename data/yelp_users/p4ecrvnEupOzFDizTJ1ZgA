I have been taking my wifes car here for 7 years. (She has a nice one I drive a work truck) these guys do a decent job. However, I recently purchased a new truck  worthy of keeping clean and washing weekly. And immediately had these guys wash it. Again a decent job. Now after detailing luxury vehicles myself for a few years I know armeral will fling up if driven immediately after wash, so I sat in the lot for 15 min while it dried.  Not a day later and it was all over the side of the truck. So I came in to have them wash the outside of the truck and explain the situation the older lady writing the tickets told me that she would take care of it and upon the truck being finished they told me that I had to pay. I explained there must be a confusion as I was told it was being taken care of. They then say they do not give free car washes. After explaining that I would get two cars washed here one time a week each. that is a hundred and four car washes per year, totaling to over $2000 a year to the wash and $500 and up in tips. They still declined to fix there bad wash. Go to any other car wash. They will do the same job for less and much faster as well. I will never go here nor would I refer anyone to go here.

Came into ButtOut for a coil. Spent about two hours learning from these guys who really know the business. The most knowledgeable and friendly staff if have encountered period. I was welcomed in by every member of the staff, they all had smiles on their faces and all of them bent over backwards to help me understand everything to do with vaping. Money bags tyler also helped out to explain the diffrences with all qualities of juice. I would recommend this shop to anyone thinking about vaping! Its been 8 months with no cigarettes ALL thanks to ButtOut and the crew!
