Excellent service. Roman, the owner, is kind and friendly with reasonable prices.   The only barber shop I frequent.

I usually am the type that only writes positive reviews. I am not the vindictive type of person. I can tell you, with certainty, this place does good work. However, that is not their problem. Their business practices are awful. The owner conducted a bait and switch on me. I had them write down the prices of their services which included shoes and pants and then when I came to pick it up, prices went up. Even prices that had tags on them for a certain amount, the owner expressed to me that they are old prices and charged 5 extra dollars after the work was already done, which I know is BS. I was warned by a friend not to go there and to go to Brothers Tailors on the other side of Camelback. For one pair of shoes they charged double because it needed a little extra work, maybe five minutes extra that I could have fixed myself if I had the time.  It reminds me of shopping in the arab marketplace in the old city in Jerusalem. It is an absolute shame that an establishment with a mezzuzah on the door treats clients with such blatant disrespect. It really is my mistake for going back there, it is not the first time they have done this to me. Plus they charge extra if you want to use a card - which is against visa bylaws. I never write bad reviews, I think its bad karma, but be warned when you walk in this store, you will get ripped off. I am 2 for 2. First time shame on them, second time shame on me for going back.   RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!

How could someone walk in this place and not have a great experience. I value my expensive Italian shoes and when the leather starts to crack and they are in need of a pro job count on this place. I just reviewed a nightmare shoe shop about a month ago down the street. This place puts the other place to shame. This shoe shop is run by authentic Italians that work hard and deserve more than their underpriced work. Thank G-d I finally found a proper shoe repair and shine store that I can count on doing not only a fantastic job but not ripping me off.

Dr. Taffet has excellent bedside manner. He is not only surgical in his practice but in his methods. I came in with major sinus headaches, pressure, and distress. He was clear about the procedure and the follow up instructions. Dr. Taffet asked me a simple question, do you want to get rid of the pressure and the headache fast and easy. I said yes... had the procedure ... now i am headache FREE feeling AMAZING!!!!!

Awesome service!! This is the first dry cleaners that I have been committed to due to the fact that I have never been so happy with how much detail they put into their work. In the years that I have been going there I have never had one complaint. By far the best service and employees. One last thing, do not forget to ask about the pickup and drop off. It is free!!! Totally worth it!

K... It's been a while since I have updated my review. I'm going to keep it simple. The place has stepped up its game. Hands down #1 dry cleaner in AZ. Perfect orders, never lose my stuff, soooooooooo consistent. That is such a major factor in my life and I don't have to worry about my things when I bring them to OrganiCare!  Awesome!

There are more managers than employees which stand around and do not do anything. They are rude and inconsiderate. They just want to move on to the next client. Managers are about as smart as a box of rocks. I had to spend hours and come to the store 4 times and spent over ten hours to try and get resolve. Don't get me wrong. I love Att but this store front is terrible. Go to any other Att store but this one.

I love att but this store is literally the worst retail environment of staff and capability I have ever seen. It's all about sales before service. I went to the same type of store in Scottsdale and got amazing service. Near Scottsdale fashion square, great location. Completely opposite of this terrible spot.

SERVICE DEPARTMENT! FANTASTIC. Dayna Bourassa and Brian B. I have had all all kinds of cars, new, used, high end, low end, and in the middle. This service department treats their clients with the utmost respect. Dayna S. Bourassa was my service agent and he took his time with me and walked me through all the questions and the problems I thought I had with my car. It was a mistake on my behalf buying from AutoNation. They, autonation, told me that the car is naturally messed up with the Bluetooth and that I am lucky that it works at all. Dayna and his associate that sits in the next desk came outside with me and we went over every issue and gave me complete resolve. They are HONEST. That is a very rare quality in a car dealership. I felt much better leaving the dealership with my clutch working as it should and my Bluetooth adjusted to work perfectly.   I am extremely stressed out tax accountant and under the pressure I am under right now, i can only imagine i am not the most pleasant person,considering its tax week. These guys were very nice, GO SEE DAYNA at Subaru on Camelback even if you didn't buy your Subaru there. He knows what he is doing!

Firstly, Garrett ( I hope I spelled his name right) is the new GM and he is cleaning house. I have had nothing but problems with my membership and mistakes were made and I was extremely annoyed. Garrett FIXED everything, no questions asked. He made himself available to me by phone throughout the week. He has top notch customer service relationships with his patrons. If it was not for the new GM I would for sure have written my first one star review but because of his actions and complete sincerity and truly his hard work, I appreciate him and what he is doing to turn around that gym. It was a 24 fitness that was left in distress and he is cleaning up the equipment, men's locker room, steam-rooms, everything that he can to the best of his ability and it physically is showing. So, for all you nay sayers out there, if you have an issue, talk to the GM. I promise you will get positive results ASAP. He is that kind of man. Results driven, goal oriented. And no, I'm not getting paid or any type of incentive to write this, I honestly had a bad experience signing up and Garrett squared me away in a professional and courteous manner even going above and beyond what he needed to do.   If you are upset, don't whine about it on yelp, talk to the management and watch how fast it gets fixed. I guarantee you all in short time, that place will be one of the top clubs in the valley. Sincerely....

Awesome service. The man behind the counter was extremely knowledgeable about his products. High end merchandise. He is the only vape shop i have been to that sells PG free all natural oil. no artificial flavors or any of that other nasty chemicals. His prices are fair and he is very friendly. He will go through every type of juice he has and give you a date (fruit) to clear your taste buds so you can taste the differences in the flavors. Truly one stop shop. I live in phoenix and i drive to Scottsdale just because he has awesome customer service and the best products around for a very fair price. Also, he is super clean. Everything is germ free and that is huge for me because i am a germ freak. Seriously, so yourself a favor go to vape sky. Awesome!
