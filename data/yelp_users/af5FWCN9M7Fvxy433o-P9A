An indoor outlet mall with many brand name stores?  Yes.  Going in to many of the stores, I realize there are really good deals here at this mall.  The mall might not be as fabulous as the Biltmore or Scottsdale Fashion Square but I'd come to here to get the job done when it comes to buying, not window shopping.

It's a great premium level fitness center/gym.  It's more than just a gym because it offers tennis courts, basketball courts, jacuzzi, indoor and outdoor swimming pools.  They even have fitness events you can join like their own triathlon.  I wish I could afford the monthly $55/mo.  What I did not like was that they raised the monthly rate with just an email notice.  I had to switch gyms due to that since I felt they should lower their price for loyalty.

I came here on a Monday night around 9PM.  There were a few small groups in the restaurant, if you want to call it that.  Their burger is similar to a BBQ burger.  Nothing too unique about the taste.  Fries though were crispy and fried well.  The condiment bar was well kept and fresh.  The ambiance was pretty depressing.  I felt like I was in a tavern established along an interstate.  I needed to get in, get out with something in my stomach that would get me by.  Job accomplished.

Some would say that the gym looks old.  It's very well kept and maintained, though.  I like the locker room and how spacious it is.  You can bring your own lock.  The gym portion is nice with a bunch of machines, a cycle room, and "dance" style studio.  The studio you can go in when there're no classes.  It's great to do circuit training in there.  The monthly price is very affordable and they reward you a discounted monthly rate after one year if you're on their loyalty plan.

This is one super cool cafe/lounge.  They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.  Wi-Fi friendly, too!

This library won my interest once I noticed the modern style of this facility.  Glass, steel, concrete, and natural sunlight all surround the library's interior.  Each level seems very spacious, with many desks and chairs to sit in.  Nearly every desk has an electrical outlet.  Wi-Fi signal at the 5th floor is very good (4/5 bars).  The all-glass walls facing north/south give amazing views of the city which makes this place perfect for reading and getting work done.  One of the best public libraries I've been to yet.

These guys know how to move.  Professional, efficient, and caters to exactly what you want them to do with your furniture.  Well worth the money.  I like how they used these blue blankets to wrap my furniture.  Flawless work.

I came in here hoping to experience a delicious carne asada torta.  On the other hand, the carne asada was very hard to chew and not pleasing to the taste.  The restaurant's interior is clean and inviting with TV screens.  Many business professionals make up the lunch time customer base.  I was just dissapointed with the carne asada.

I like this place.  Nice neighborhood barber shop.  Came here on a Sunday as it was packed.  Guess it's because it's the only day they're open on a weekend.  Long line but did not have to wait too long as they had many barbers working.  My #2 on the sides and back and scissor cut on top looked great.

The wifey and I came here on a Saturday Valentine's Day night.  Parking was easy since it's in a plaza.  We had reservations booked online so we were not worried about waiting for a seat.  It was already busy as they have a bar and outdoor patio that was popping.  Everything was very new and in great condition.  Their sushi and teriyaki dish was good.  Lots of chicken in the teriyaki.  At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the owner and she was very elegant.  She gave my wife a complementary single rose for the occasion.  Awesome!  This is a lively Japanese/Chinese fusion restaurant/bar in Chandler that has to be tried.

I get my haircut from Polo and flawless fade every time.  Do make an appointment on  the weekends since it's 1+hr wait if you walk in.  They have TVs, Movies playing.  Such a laid back, cool atmosphere.

I stumbled across this restaurant when looking for food on a Sunday.  Nothing was open nearby but this Mexican restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered a Chimichanga meal which was very large and filling.  The food was very good for the money ($7) and the lady server was very nice.  There are TVs in the restaurant but none of them were working at the time.  If you want a quick bite of Mexican food, come here!

I came here on a Saturday morning to sample this hyped up BBQ in Phoenix.  My friends and I waited in line at 10:45AM and hung out like it was a ride to wait at a theme park.  One hour later, we finally got to the counter to order and it was well worth it.  The meat carver was cutting fatty brisket like it was nothing.  I ordered a brisket and rib combo.  These guys know how to BBQ.  So tender, so juicy, and the meat fell right off the bone.  Parking was scarce since it's a small lot but they have parking attendants to guarantee you a spot!  Need a place to hang out with friends and enjoy some delicious BBQ?  Come here!

Came here on a beautiful sunny day for lunch.  This was a very unique cafe.  Empenadas were displayed clearly through the glass so you get to see exactly how it looks before you buy it.  The lemonade and tea was delicious and very fresh.  The empenanadas were heated up and quickly served to us within 5 minutes of sitting down.  Wonderful local cafe inside of the District at Tempe Marketplace!

I was in the midst of finding a new shop to get my monthly hair cuts when I noticed Keep It Cut was opening next to my local Whole Foods market.  I decided to come in one Saturday morning to try it out.  Since the shop was brand new, everything was very clean and well kept. They played hip hop, techno, industrial type of music which is fitting for the theme at the shop.  I checked-in online at their website which put me in the queue so they would expect me.  (Not much of a line on a Saturday morning but thought it would get me in line to speed up things.)  Felicia, my stylist, was efficient, skilled, and knew my basic "crew" style as I described it.  They offer monthly memberships that include unlimited cuts, shampoos, and facial grooming which is what I find this shop to be very unique and affordable.  Single cut I got was also a bang-for-your-buck $17.
