We checked in to the Flamingo hotel and opened the door to our room to find it smelling like pot, towels all over the floor, bed trashed, and alcohol beverages all over the tv stand. It wasn't even the type of room we reserved for the extra money we spent.   Then we are given a new room. Still not the one we reserved. Now for the slap in the face from #FlamingoLasVegas its in the furthest place from any type of elevator or other life form! I was the one that wanted to stay here because it was great last year.

OMG sooo good! I want more! So many amazing flavors. I have not been a fan of gelato until now! I will defiantly be back to this lower calorie option to feed an ice cream craving!

My boyfriend and I LOVE BBQ so making comparisons is easy! We tried Allison's for dinner tonight. We purchased the Big Tex and got pulled pork, ribs, and slices beef brisket. Our sides were the beans and their corn soufflé. All of the meat was tender and cooked perfectly. The three BBQ sauce options were just alright though. I needed up  using a combination of the sweet and sassy sauces. The corn soufflé was just like a corn casserole my family has been making for years; it was pretty good in comparison! The beans however were a one bite and done. I'm pretty picky with beans. I can't nail down the spice but there was too much of it for me in the beans! One down side was the music playing in the restaurant...didn't seem to fit the atmosphere! Not a huge deal though! All in all I highly recommend visiting for a meal!

Out the door....tax, title, and license we paid $54 for two meals.  A 14 oz ribeye with two  sides (asparagus and scalloped potatoes), then an 8 oz filet topped with crab meat, sauce, two sides (garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus), and a Caesar salad.   We also had a nice tea for just $1 (way better than McDonald's haha).   We were given a complimentary bite of filet when we sat down, pepperoni bread, cheese bread, and bacon corn bread (I wasn't find of this though) and between courses, they gave us a tiny scoop if sorbet to cleans thy pallet!   Best steak meal for an awesome price! Come check it out!

Sat there for 10 minutes and not a single person came by. No drinks, no "we will be right with you"... Nothing! So we got up and walked out. On our way out the same lady that sat us ten minutes prior said have a good night and thanks for coming!

Picked this place for a date night with my boyfriend. Had a blast playing glow mini golf and glow air hockey. While I lost by only a little, the holes were relatively simple and some a bit more challenging. We had a great time and look forward to going back again, on our own or with our kids! Also, the price was great for a game and you can play again for about have price! Sweet!

Great seafood boils. Spices are really spicy! I got the number 1 "wimpy" spice and it was almost too much. Veggies were cooked well and the seafood was excellent. Great place to go and dig into your food...literally!
