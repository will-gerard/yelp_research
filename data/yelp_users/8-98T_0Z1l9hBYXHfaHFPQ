I spent over $3000 on my car at this place since July. Why the 5 stars? Because I was not ripped off, everything was explained to me...step by step if needed (and I did need it - ha), nobody in this shop is a douchebag, the other customers are even nice, they don't try to rip off the ladies, they don't try to upsell me crap I don't need unless I ask if there's other crap I might need, and I'm pretty sure if I hadn't been out of town they would've let me seen the damage to my engine and walked me through the process if I'd asked so I could do my nerdy internet search on serpentine belts and motor mounts and all that other crap that was wrong.  I knew they weren't effing with me because when I bought the car a few years ago the creepy dealership supposedly changed the motor mounts. When Virginia Auto Service identified a problem with (and subsequent damage as a result of) the motor mounts, I knew it was true, and I thought about that tug in my stomach I ignored when I bought the car that told me NOT TO BUY THE CAR OR TRUST THIS CREEPY CAR SALESMAN.   Seriously, if you have a problem with something this shop tells you all you have to do is ask and see if they can work with you - find different parts, develop a plan to do repairs in steps...ask your grandpa to come in and hand them wrenches or wipe the sweat from their brow so you can have a discount as they diligently work to repair the vehicle you neglected and ignored for over 2 years knowing full well you were driving a heap.   When they quoted me a price over the phone I said "THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PAY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO CHANCE I CAN PAY THAT" while my head was exploding and my face was melting (at work). I don't know if they want this advertised, but they let me leave my car there for over a month (closer to two months) while I made gradual payments and they did the repairs. My job sent me to BFE Texas and Virginia Auto Service just let me leave it there because it couldn't be driven. That's effing CLASS, folks.  Because they are so awesome I tell everyone I know about this experience, I write positive reviews whenever I get the opportunity, and I will not be taking my crappy little car anywhere else.

Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one.

I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre. I live less than a mile away, was jonesing for indian food one day, and didn't want to drive far. I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home.   The menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences. HMMM, let's see. I don't know if i'm going to describe this correctly:  Okay, I'm a vegetarian - DON'T STOP READING THIS, DAMNIT! I know what good food is!  Starting over - I'm a vegetarian, and I eat A LOT of indian food, and I have eaten at a lot of indian food places. I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu. You know what I mean?  Who cares if you know what I mean - FOUR STARS!

It's ok. Not a lot to say about it. Average food, average prices.

This place is gooood. The food seems fresher than most indian food places, and it definitely doesn't taste like it's been sitting out all day. That might actually be a complaint. I'm so used to eating vegetable pakoras that have been sitting in a vat under a heat lamp that these were too fresh for me to like. You know? It's like being raised on Taco Bell and being so used to that as your definition of Mexican food that when you actually go to a Mexican food joint with fresh ingredients you're like, "WTF is this?"  Oh yeah, and it's definitely more expensive than other places in the valley.

If you've ever lived, visited, or had relatives back east (because pizza in the west is usually shite), this is reminiscent of the kind of pizza you'd eat at the local place down the street, complete with the angry looking italian dude in the kitchen. I don't know if he was really angry, but he was staring outside like he was about to pull the fluffy clouds out of the sky and beat the rain out of them for being so damn fluffy. This dude has nothing to do with the food, other than his angry face makes it taste so damn good.  I had something on the lunch menu called "the perfect pizza," and it was indeed the perfect portion; a small pizza and a small salad. I have no idea what the rest of the food tastes like, or if the angry dude in the kitchen will be making it.

The only reason Delhi Palace gets 5 stars is because it was my intro to indian food. Now i have to eat indian food several times a month, and if you ask me to eat it more than once a week, i'll do it. I'll even eat it more than once a day to spite you. I'm addicted and i blame Delhi Palace. I don't NEED you, Delhi Palace, i just WANT you!   It's not my favorite indian food place, but it's my "indian food baseline." Every other indian food place is compared to Delhi Palace. It's like eating mom's meatloaf. You may not even like meatloaf, but you'll eat it when mom makes it because it's your mom and she'll make you sit at the dinner table until it's all done, anyway.   Wait, what? I think you know what i mean, don't play dumb.  No, really though. It's not the best, but it's definitely awesome.

I love Lux. I love it. My friendship with Lux has seen me through three past relationships and a current relationship, which is astounding. I would marry Lux, but my life, my lover, my lady, is the the sea (ha ha, I got jokes). I've been going to Lux forever. Sometimes sporadically, but for the past year every Saturday except when I'm out of town, and when I'm out of town and it's Saturday, I miss this g*d*mn place. I went to a sushi place a month or so back and the server there recognized me from when she worked at Lux years ago.   People mention the too-hip crowd, but I have to let you know that they're the kind of too-hip kids that used to be fat in high school. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here except the little kids who make faces at me or offer me their stuffed animals while I'm in line, those d*mn kids (jokes, again). There was, of course, one time this guy tried to take my place and mark it with his apple computer before I even got up from my seat, but I scolded him like a puppy (a strong "NO!") and told him he could have the seat when I decide to leave. You might think, "well, if you don't recognize the too-hip kids, then you, too, must be a too-hip bastard," but let me tell you, I'm 31-going-on-65. My goal in life is to become a golden girl, I am currently really excited that there might be a concert band I can join, and my blood pressure goes over the top when I throw rocks into the ocean. Hip, I am not.  Mad props to the owner and his boisterous voice, Shadi (I don't know how to spell her name but she's there most Saturday mornings), the newish counter lady with the short red hair on Saturdays, the many rotating coffeemaking dudes, and the dude who sits in the corner on Sunday by the roaster room and plays music from a laptop over the speakers. There's also a coffeemaking dude at night whose name I don't know, but he's hilarious. You know it's been a rough day when I'm rolling in at 9:45 pm to get some caffeine, and this dude always makes me laugh. He's one of the too-hip people there with thick rimmed plastic frames.  I just realized I posted a review without reviewing the product. OY! The espresso is great. I've never experienced the drip coffee, but I've gotten various espresso drinks from cappuccinos to dolled-up espresso mochas. They're consistently fantastic. I can think of two occasions I didn't like the espresso, and they were both drinks in which I decided to go with soy milk. Every so often, I pull a hippy move and decide to try soy in coffee. It's horrible no matter where you go, so I don't hold it against Lux.

This place gave me the poops. I wasn't gonna be so direct but someone else in here said it gave them stomach pains, so I thought I'd throw it out there. I had a cheese pizza. The plainest pizza available, and it made me poop out of my ears.  This Rosati's does not taste as good as other Rosati's - I've eaten at the location in Maricopa, which is AWESOME, and a couple of locations in the Chicago area, which are inherently awesome. I notice that there are two Rosati's websites: rosatispizza.com and myrosatis.com. I don't know why, but the good Rosati's I have been to are under rosatispizza.com, and NOT myrosatis.com. They both have different locations listed.

I try to reserve my 5 stars for really special occasions. On this occasion, I tried so hard to find something wrong in order to reserve a star for myself. My greedy little hands wanted to keep the fifth star, but after dessert was served the food coma relaxed me enough so the fifth star could be pried from my hands.   The cheese curds were fantastic; the classy urban socialite version of the curds you find at the Wisconsin state fair. A little salty...but they're CHEESE CURDS. The mac and cheese was amazing, we had ours sans prosciutto. I ate the shrimp poboys which blew my mind, and the salad was great as well. The thing that took it over the top was the dessert. Banana something-or-another cake. Eat the cake. Eat two. If I were to eat nothing but this cake for the rest of my life, my life would still be AWESOME.  I was amazed at the atmosphere. This is the kind of place you walk in and expect douchebags. Having a look around, I saw normal folks; teachers off of work, jeans and shirts dudes, and grandma and grandpa. I am dreading the day this place is taken over by the douchebag hipster crowd. Stay classy, Tuck Shop.  I also want to add that the bartender with the tattoo on the back of her right arm did a great job. She was killin' it that evening. Great service.

We dropped a party of 11 on them, last minute, not too far from closing time and the service was AMAZING. The server was excellent, her suggestions were right-on, and she even offered to take a dish back when she noticed one person in the party was surprised by the spiciness of her dish. This person didn't complain about the dish, the server just noticed the look on her face and offered to take it back.   Zeeeeee food: so good. SO. GOOD.   I would give this place 5 stars, but I did not have a chance to have any appetizers and rate them with the whole meal, so it's my fault. I will just have to go back and edit my review.   -----fin-----

If you like overpriced sushi that's extra medium, this place is for you. The service was awesome, though. Nice peoples here. If I was drunk and not able to drive and somehow found myself on this street in Phoenix craving sushi in front of this restaurant, I will probably take off my shoes and pants and start drunk dialing my friends until someone picks me up and takes me to a different sushi place. Just kidding, my friends wouldn't take me to a different sushi place. They would probably just take me home.

Being the ancient age of 30, I have just now realized that I can categorize pizza into 2 categories: fancy pizza, and hood pizza. Hood pizza is the kind of pizza you buy in your hood. This includes the chain restaurants and those local joints that may not have a wood-fired oven, or they may have a wood-fired oven, it just depends on how the place feels. Some hood places mask themselves as fancy pizza, and hood pizza can sometimes be mistaken for fancy pizza. It is totally subject to the whim of the individual. A hood place can never receive more than 4 yelp stars, but 4 stars is good. A fancy pizza place can never be compared to a hood pizza place. They are two completely different worlds.   This place is fancy. If you are normal, and not a douchebag, just ignore all the douchebag clientele in this place although it might be hard because we are all packed like sardines. Remember, you are focused on the pizza. You. Pizza. Focus.  I'm sorry I can't remember the server's name, but she was AWESOME and attentive. Her behavior almost made me stop thinking the douchebag at the table next to me was a pedophile. The hostess was also really nice - we came in on a Saturday night without a reservation, so we had to wait about 45 minutes which was fine except for the douchebag clientele complaining about how they have to wait for so long. Effers. The hostess handled the situation with grace.  We started with that salad that has the mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. I can't remember it and I'm not pausing to look it up. All you need to know was that it was fantastic. I've had many of these salads, and I get really angry because tomatoes don't taste like tomatoes anymore, they taste like nothing. A watery nothing. The tomatoes in this salad were pretty good. Not the tomatoes I remember as a kid, but still tasty.  The kitchen lost our pizza ticket, and the server, again, a really nice person, admitted it and said she would have it right away. This was fine because I knew it would be quick and I could continue eavesdropping on the douchebag on the other side of me, talking in a fake east coast italian accent about how his italian grandmother beat him to discipline him. I think he was lying, because if he was disciplined by someone as a child, he wouldn't talk like such a douchebag.  Anyway, the pizza WAS AWESOME. I AM NOW TYPING IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD. We had a margherita pizza. I don't know if i spelled that right, and I don't care. The sauce was simple but really effing good. The crust melts in your mouth and is perfectly chewy with a little bit of crunch from the charred bubbles. I will make the trek to Douchebagville, AZ for another pizza soon, but not on a Saturday night.

I want this place to be my house. The seats are giant and comfortable, the beer here is the kind of beer I like, and the servers are extremely nice and smiley. Smiley people are either creepy or trustworthy. The dude that was behind the bar Sunday afternoon was the smiley trustworthy type.   I'm the kind of person that drinks one beer and is drunk. I drank one beer and sank 25 feet into one of the giant comfy movie chairs while watching a Bill Plympton film. My friend actually fell asleep in his chair with his legs crossed. I also like the sound in this place. It's niiiiiiiiice....so comfy...snooore snore snore...  The only thing that would be lacking is the snack selection. I like a broad range of snacks. Maybe it's for ease that they don't have a diverse snack selection, or maybe I've been in society too long that I've been trained to expect snacks at a movie. Damn it, I'm like Pavlov's dog.   Anyway, if this place is gonna be my house someday I would like more snacks. The end.
