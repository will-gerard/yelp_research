Great place to sit outside, drink some yummy local beer, and have some good eats with friends! They have a large outside sitting area to match their inside bar area. The food was delish! Seriously thee best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had - and the pita bread it's served with was fresh! I ordered the blackened salmon BLT, which I was kind of skeptical about at first, but so glad I decided to go with it once I tasted it.   To drink we started with the sampler board, cool concept if you're new to craft beers, but there were only 3 of us at lunch so a lot of the beers we didn't like went to waste.   If you're not big on IPA's and hoppy beers, I highly recommend getting half Sunbru & half of the Peach Ale.  Both very light and crispy. The peach is a bit too peachy for me but when you half it with some Sunbru, it's the perfect combination!

Some of the staff was very friendly & helpful, others clueless on how to use the computer. A routine vaccination that should have taken 15 minutes took over an hour.

Jackie is the best. She consistently does amazing acrylics & gel on my hands & feet. Just make sure you call and make an appointment with her - she's that good!

As a single female, it's tough finding a car repair place that is trustworthy & honest. I never have any doubts when I come to Slaughter & Associates.

I loved coming to this place. The trainers were friendly and motivating. However, the cancelation process has been a headache. And would I have known back then how much of a hassle this would be, I would have never signed up.   I signed up for the month to month plan because I knew my time in Phoenix had an expiration date, per I travel for work and relocate frequently. I initially paid $188 to sign up and then $89 for a monthly recurring fee.   When I left Phoenix in April I called to cancel, I was told I had to come in and sign paperwork, which was impossible for me since I now lived in Colorado. The man on the phone (one of the trainers but I can't recall his name) took my info and said he would have the owner call me back. Two months later, no call back.

Where am I? The south, or the west coast!?? Seriously THEE best BBQ I've ever had. EVERYTHING was delightful. The beans, the grits, and the pecan pie were necessary sides. And the beef brisket, TO DIE FOR! As was the pulled pork, and sausage. Not to mention their BBQ sauces - all three were amazing, though you don't even need to use them because the meat is so flavorful and juicy and perfect without them. If you are in the Phoenix area and haven't experienced LMB's you are not living!
