I remember walking out of my eye exam thinking 'Wow I had a lovely visit!'. How crazy is that thought coming after an optometrist appointment?! Dr. Mastores was so friendly and informative (and bonus, she gave me lots of samples). She explained all the images they took of my eyes and the eye assistants and admin staff were also very personable. I'd recommend Central Phoenix Eye in a heartbeat.

My family loves it here. It's not the fanciest and maybe I'm just sentimental but the food is consistently good and they make THE best skinny margaritas. Most places make skinny margs that taste like watered down limeade - the ones at Ajo's are full of flavor and strong. They also have some of my favorite queso in PHX.  If you're coming here for the first time - don't be intimidated by the menu. It's very busy (they need a redesign with a new graphic designer asap) but they carry all the Mexican-American basics. The service is pretty standard but it's certainly worth checking out if you're looking to try a New Mexican place.

This store is a mess. I went in yesterday right before noon. The store opens at 11am on Sunday, so you think the place would be in pretty good condition, right? Wrong. For only being open 40-45 mins, it was really messy. Makeup boxes were out of place and strewn about shelves, eye liner colors were not in correct color slots for multiple brands, and worst of all, there were swabs/tissues/cotton wipes covered in used makeup samples everywhere. Waiting to check out next to the little "on the go" products kiosk, the shelves were full of gross samples swabs and wipes. There's no excuse for finding a used cotton ball full of foundation next to a bunch of lip balm. It was gross. I don't know if they forgot to clean up the night before... or the whole week before... but I was not impressed. It's not their fault the shoppers don't know how to use trash cans, but they are responsible for keeping a clean store.

Went back one week later. Still filthy. Only one cashier handling a long line of people waiting to check out. Get it together Ulta. I'd rather drive to Sephora to get my overpriced shampoo.

I decided to give a Ulta one last shot. It's just so conveniently close to my house. Waited around the Bare Minerals counter forever for help with foundation matching before finally going and looking for someone.... But then I couldn't find anyone. Two girls were headed to the back talking about how psyched they were to clock out (it was an hour before close) and another girl was ringing people up. You have failed me, Camelback Ulta. I really, really hate writing these sort of reviews, but this is three visits now where the customer service was absent. This location is understaffed and it's still dirty (see photo from previous review). It just isn't worth the hassle. I wish I could give 0 stars.

The pharmacy gave me someone else's prescription. They're lucky I opened the bottle and recognized the pills didn't look right before I took the medication and ended up in the ER. I now have some random guy's address, name, medicine info, doctors info, and pills... but I am without my own Rx.

I'm not sure what I paid for here.. For $15 it looks like all they did was run my car through the wash and mess up my seat settings. I couldn't see any evidence they had vacuumed and the dash wasn't even wiped down. I ended up going to Walmart and buying a $3 pack of Lysol wipes and getting my car clean on my own.   I tried Danny's because it was right by my house, but I will be looking for a different car wash place. The kids cleaning the cars weren't friendly and there was only one girl running the cash register and the line was out the door. I feel like any manager with half a brain would know better than to have one clerk at a car wash on a sunny Saturday morning. They probably could have used three.  When I went to leave, I got in the car and was putting on my seatbelt.. and the kid cleaning the car behind me HONKED at me. I hadn't been in my car for more than 20 seconds! I know they're trying to keep things moving, but come on, at least let the girl who just tipped you for doing literally nothing put on her seatbelt!

First, thank you Hava Java for being open at 530 am. I couldn't believe my luck when I passed it so early in the morning.  It's got a nice, local coffee shop vibe and friendly staff. My grandparents were regulars here for years and always called it "Jake's" because Jake was so good to them.   This place is very accommodating for all sorts of dietary restrictions. I didn't actually mean to buy it, but they sell gluten free biscotti if you're GF (it tasted wonderful!), they offer soy milk for those of us who can't have diary, and they have both honey and agave for vegans over on the sugar counter.  Its slightly pricey, but really I don't think it's any more than a Starbucks or Wholefoods latte or snack. Worth a shot if you're in the neighborhood.

Five stars. Seriously just go. The service was top notch and the atmosphere was so wonderful - awesome design inside and their playlist was all music I have on my iPhone right now: The Shins, James Bay, ect. The food was truly beautiful and tasted just as good as it looked. I was sad I felt full before I finished all my bruschetta. My family LOVED that all the bruschetta slices were already cut into fourths so we could easily share. We will be back again and again.

Really thankful for Yelp to leading me to a good PHX dentist! The staff is friendly, they took my insurance (I know, I know, that's mostly luck, but still) and my appointments have started exactly on time. I made it very clear I needed to be out in an hour to make it to work on time one day and they happily worked with my schedule. I'd be quick to recommend this group.

PROS: - Awesome floor plans. I loved having an actual laundry room, two entrances to the bathroom, and all the windows. There was a lot of natural light! I've had a handful of apartments and this was the first that did not feel like a glorified Holiday Inn. - The location is awesome. Really close to the mall, the highways, and good food.  - The complex is pretty quiet. Mostly young families and some retirement age people.  - The staff is nice and generally helpful. I've read bad reviews for going through the leases renewal process and unfortunately I have no feedback to offer on that since I did not renew.  - The apartment was very clean when I moved in. To my understanding San Cervantes brings in cleaning crews every time a resident moves out.   CONS: - The walls are PAPER THIN. I would often hear closing doors or drawers from the people on the other side of my unit, as well as the occasional tv/stereo. Bass from my neighbor's stereo would make the walls shake in my room.  -One weekend my water shut off for a few hours. Yes, I paid the water bill. No one answered the voicemails I left the emergency maintenance line. When the water came back on, it was running brown. Everything - the dishwasher, the toilet, the sinks, the washing machine - had brown tinted water for a bit. I sent a service request in online as well and they closed it out without answering it. Supposedly this was an apartment-wide issue, but there was never an explanation. - The 'security gates' don't do much. Almost every time I used my gate opener to get into the complex at night, another car (sometimes two) followed me in. You have no idea if the people coming in after you are actually residents. I even saw cars enter via the 'exit only' gate, meaning they drove the wrong way down a one-way, when other people left. If someone really wanted to enter without being a resident, they could, and they could easily. Supposedly there was a home intrusion in late December here and a resident shot someone. I felt safe here but the gate provided very little security. Like any house or apartment, you need to be aware of your surroundings and be vigilant.   Ultimately, I think most of the cons are things I could have lived with long term. The random water shut off was my only real complaint. I lived here for too short of a period to use the gym or pool so I can't offer any feedback on those.

I've been so pleased with Oxford cleaners. They get my clothes back to me when I need them and the actual dry cleaning work and ironing has been really well done. The staff is super friendly (they remember me!) and it's a very clean, professional looking business.   Only downside is they are a little on the pricey side, even when you use coupons.

Scummy bar with just okay food and probably some of the worst service I've had at a restaurant. Don't get high before you go to work, kids. Our sever didn't take all the orders, messed up drinks, and completely forgot someone's food. It showed up with the check. He took it off the bill, but still disappointing. I'd be more forgiving if the place wasn't completed deserted when we went there. The food (that showed up) was alright. No part of the experience has me rushing back.

Cold, dried out cinnamon rolls that definitely did not taste fresh even though I stopped by around 730 am... Maybe I need to go to an actual Cinnamon? Not worth the calories.

Beautiful salon, very clean and modern. Pretty standard pricing for a good nail place. They took me last minute right before the holidays which was much appreciated! My nails looked great after my mani but the girl did snip my cuticle with the clippers while prepping my nails and made me bleed a little.. Not unforgivable but I haven't had someone break the skin of my cuticles during a mani in ages. Those itty bitty little cuts sting! She did put some alcohol/antiseptic on it and the rest of the mani was smooth sailing. I'd come back next time I'm in Tempe and need my nails done but I'd request that they not cut my cuticles.

This place is dangerous to live near/work by/drive past. I think this is some of the best shaved ice I've had! The ice is really thinly shaved and the flavor range is impressive. I will guiltily admit I have been here for lunch a few times. The only reason I don't give five stars is for service,  they seem understaffed and cannot handle the incoming orders from both the drive thru and the in-store customers.

Not impressed. We are moving and had our house 'deep cleaned' in preparation for showing it to potential buyers. While initially pleased, we keep finding major misses. For a deep clean, they missed a lot of corners with the vacuum, simple spots on the floor, and even a few bugs along a windowsill. The biggest disappointment was their attempt to clean the stainless steel appliances. Whatever they used to clean then left horrible smears and honestly made it all look dirtier than it was originally. We just went to Target and got some stainless steel cleaner and wiped them down ourselves and saw a huge improvement. Their 'deep clean' probably wasn't impressive enough to justify ever having them come back and be paid for something we could have done ourselves.

I've ordered pick up via Yelp/ApplePay as well as eaten in here - delicious either way! The staff is friendly and the food is so good. They are very careful about food allergies. I've tried several Thai places around PHX and while I think this is the priciest it's my favorite.

I'm the daughter of a coal miner, I felt obligated to check this place out. The wait was long (45 mins) and the bar was a little slow when we wanted drinks to keep us held over until we got seated.. But one we got food, the pizza was impressive. Good crust, not too greasy cheese (though I did wish there was more), and our food server was very friendly and attentive. If you're sick of delivery pizza and are looking for a unique pizza place, go here. You get to see the pizza being made behind the counters and as expected, the place smalls amazing. This isn't a fast in and out place to eat, so don't come in a hurry if you want to make a movie that starts in a half hour - it's the sort of place where you don't mind hanging out for bit.  I should note - I actually found a piece of coal in my pizza.. It was pretty identifiable, but a little bit of a surprise. Apparently it's a normal thing from the cooking process.. Just keep an eye out.

I'm always on the hunt for some good falafels and I have a little sister who is not a fan of trying foods more exotic than hamburgers. My Big Fat Greek Restaurant offers Americanized Greek food, so it seemed like the perfect place for dinner for us to both find something we'd be happy with. We ordered a bunch of plates so she could sample some Greek food but also had the safety net of a pizza.   The spanakopita - amazing. Hands down the best dish we had. Yummy flavors and lots of spinach.   Falafels - pretty good! I could tell they were shaped by hand and not too greasy. Really moist inside and crispy outside, just how a falafel should be! I thought the spices were okay in the tzatziki. I like really strong flavoring and dill and my not-very-adventurous sister does not, so she happily ate her share.   Pizza (margherita) - actually yummy for a Greek resturau. Tasted like homemade dough and fresh mozzarella. They were kinda skimpy on the cheese for my taste.  Mojito - the only real disappointment of the night. It tasted like sugar water and fresh mint with minimum booze. Oh well, I doubt the ancient Greeks were drinking minty cocktails.  I'm already looking forward to our next visit. Super vegetarian friendly and great atmosphere.

We had a really nice stay here! Our red room was BEAUTIFUL and the staff was very helpful. I highly suggest checking in online and skipping the lines in the lobby, all you have to do is pick up your keys and show your ID. We were surprised only three people were running the check ins on a Saturday.   Every time we called Paris with questions we were able to speak to someone very quickly and they were informative and friendly.   Pool was nice - lots of seating available and towels are given to you when you walk in. Drink prices were atrocious but that was not a surprise.   We only had one meal here, breakfast at the Creperie. Very good! The line was long but the price actually wasn't bad compared to local crepe places I have been to.     I'm interested to see my bill - I had a mini heart attack when I checked my credit card statement online, there were a few charges on my card I wasn't expecting. When I called the Paris billing team they told me one was a temporary charge and would clear away once my payment for the room went through. I get that, but usually when people put temporary charges on a card its a few cents, not half the price of your room! The other charge was for checking in early and checking out early. This I'm going to have to hash out with someone because we checked in early but left at our correct check out time. $50 seems a bit high for an early check in...

As someone who has worked in a sushi restaurant, I'm a major sushi snob. I nitpick everything from the rice to the seaweed to the fish. I like Delux because the sushi is pretty decent and they're open late. I love love love their reverse happy hour! The service is pretty standard. Good ambiance, a little loud but still enjoyable. This is a great place to go alone and enjoy the late happy hour with a roll or two. They have an animated shark tank above the sushi bar which is fun to sit back and watch for a bit. I think the rolls are a little too thick to comfortably fit in your mouth in one bite (the rice ratio is a little off), but the roll varieties that I have tied have been really good. Definitely try the tiger roll is you are looking for something sweet and spicy!

I am not a hiker. I have never in my life gone hiking. A friend invited me to go up Camelback and I thought 'hey why not, how hard can it be?' I just finsihed reading Wild and was way too motivated to climb one little mountain.  Well.. I lived. It was fun, but I was not prepared for it. I thought it would be just walking uphill.. Nope. There are lots of steep rocks and hills to climb. I'm still impressed by the people I saw RUN up the trail. I was that slowpoke in everyone's way, sorry.   I will definitely go back, when I'm a little more in shape and have better shoes. I was wearing just average gym shoes and definitely wished I had actually hiking shoes during some slippery spots.   I suggest: 1. Go early. We showed up at 10am on a Sunday and the lot was closed because it was already full. This threw me off - there wasn't an obvious satellite lot nearby. I haven't lived in Phoenix for long and wasn't sure what to do. We ended up driving around the neighborhoods and circling around the roundabout a few times before the lot opened. Once we got in we still had to wait a while for a spot, basically stalking a couple to their car to get one. The parking was really the worst part of the whole experience, the trails need a LOT more space.  And 2. Bring a backpack. You will want two hands for climbing. I only had my car keys and water bottle (you obviously need to bring water!) but I still felt burdened by them. You will be a happy hiker if you have free hands.

Um, yum! We grabbed some togo cups of gelato for desert after leaving the grocery store and ended up caving and eating them before dinner because we didn't want to wait. Really high quality, rich gelato.   The service here was so great and the presentation of the gelato is absolutely stunning. There are LOTS of flavors to choose from including some dairy free. They also have milkshakes and cakes.   It's not cheap, but gelato never is, so no surprises there. I think my only complaint is I only got one flavor, next time I'm going for two!

Being vegetarian, a burger joint is usually the last place I want to go for dinner. This Red Robin is in a shopping area and after a day of errand running my family and I decided to go in and eat since it was convenient. I figured I was going to end up with a salad and asking them to remove the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to find veggie burgers on the menu.  And it was actually delicious! I've been to several other RRs and this is by far the nicest. The place is spotless, bright, and all the furniture is fun and new. We had a great server (I can't remember his name, but he had an edgy hair cut with lots of piercings) and the manager brought out food out and checked on us. It was worth taking the chance, I'd come back next time I'm in the area.

Is it loud? Yes. Expensive? Of course, it's Vegas and it's a half high end restaurant half night club. Is it still worth it? Yes. Just go. The service is phenomenal is the atmosphere is awesome.   Be warned: going to Tao will ruin you for sushi. I'm worried I will never be able to top it.

So many cute little trinkets and local jewelry and Arizona themed items! I love shopping at Frances because the girls who work there are so sweet and every time I visit I actually want to buy the whole store. This is the perfect place to find a unique gift or a cute shirt that shows off your PHX pride. Congratulations on ten years Frances! I hope the community supports you for many more!

Great spinach roll ups! I really enjoyed my meal here, the food and the service were both good. They make their own dressing and leave bottles of it on the table to try, which is awesome. I loved that this was a fast food option without the guilt - they even stated on their menu which meals were under 500 calories.

What you would expect from a nail place in a grocery store parking lot. They take walk ins and pricing was about average for a shellac mani. Staff is friendly but chatty - don't be surprised when they ask you how much you make at your job, what your house is worth, and how much you paid for your car, ect. Even though I got shellac my nail paint was peeling off after five days.

A girlfriend sent me a box of these as a housewarming gift and they were so beautiful I almost didn't want to eat them! Sometimes I've found the "pretty" chocolates don't taste so great, but these were to. die. for. The little round chocolates in my box were a chocolate shell covered in toffee and nut crumbs and filled with caramel. Ahh-mazing. My box barely lasted the weekend, and then lo and behold I found out a physical Julia Baker store is just down the street from me! I fear I'm about to become a regular customer.

To keep this simple: I think this place has the best bang for your buck. There are some places in Vegas that charge $20+ for a drink and you can't hardly taste the booze. This place certainly makes sure you walk away - literally, cuz no one cares if you walk around with a sealed Fat Tuesday drink in Vegas - with a buzz. The drinks taste good, they're strong, and they're actually pretty reasonably priced. And the staff was really friendly, which was refreshing, because I'm sure they are dealing with thousands of annoying drunk people all day and that can test your friendliness level pretty quickly. I don't know why we didn't visit this place the last time we went to Vegas, but we're definitely coming back!

Okay, I'll admit, I only went to check out the ATM. But then two days later I went back to the ATM again, because PMS tends to strike around 9 o'clock when other bakeries close. $5 for a cupcake, but it tasted really fresh, and the actual cake part was delicious. I agree with others, the icing is a little heavy, but it's rather there be too much instead of too little! Can't wait to try some other flavors.  So far tried: chocolate coconut. Good, but almost too sweet. This one was icing heavy. Next visit: I got strawberry and hands down it beat every other strawberry cupcake I have had in my life. Even the frosting was strawberry ish, and I almost wished there was more because it just tastes like a whipped strawberry fudge. Yum!

My coworkers decided to meet for happy hour twice this week and this was our pick for the second night of afterhours drinking. This place is a lots of fun, but be warned, it is LOUD! They crank up the music and it's packed, so while it's a cool environment it is very hard to hear the person next to you. Probably not the kind of place you want to take Grandma for dinner. The blare a great variety of music from 311 to heavy metal to Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.  The appetizers were my favorite, killer onion rings and hummus! My entire work team was discussing how we wanted to recreate that hummus because we want to be able to eat it all the time. I ordered a black bean burger but was told it was recalled because the facility that made them had a possible had a cross-contamination issue with peanuts. Not a big deal, but I was a little bummed because that mean they bought frozen/premade black bean burgers. I was hoping a place like this made them fresh in house. I got a quesadilla, which was pretty blah. I wish I had just stuck with pineapple beer and apps, because that would have made an awesome meal alone!  I want to note that we had really great service. Our waitress clearly had a lot of tables in addition to our big one and she was very patient and attentive. We have some dietary restrictions (me the vegetarian, a gluten free coworker, and a vegan AND gluten free coworker) and she made sure every meal was made correctly and was very understanding of our needs.   Its only 10am now and I already want to go back for more pineapple beer!

Yum! I'm always up for a place that makes falafel. Be warned the Greek salad isn't in a vinegar based dressing like you would expect elsewhere but a creamy one, im assuming some kind of yoghurt sauce. They're very generous with it! Bonus points for Zs for having a drive thru too!

Five stars, all around. These guys are so friendly and they work fast, although they can be busy. I really owe multiple Discount Tire locations reviews because I've been two or thee of them around the valley now and they've all been outstanding.   Back story - I hate dealing with my car. I know nothing about how tires or how cars work. When you're female and short and blonde you constantly fear techs and salespeople sense your lack of knowledge and try to take advantage of it. I've been charged absurd amounts and recommended unnecessary procedures in the past because people assume I don't know any better (I usually don't). I once went to get an oil change at some auto shop and they came back with over 2k worth of things they wanted to do to my car. Now I put off dealing with car crap as long as possible.  So. Imagine my surprise the first time I came here to get my tire patched and they said 'no charge'. Seriously?! This has happened twice now - I've brought them my poor little Mini Cooper after driving over some nail or screw and they actually give me an invoice of $0. They also check tire pressure for free.  Major kudos to this location this morning - I showed up around 7:50 am to be there right when they opened to deal with my tire and there was already a line. They opened the doors before 8 am and had a whole team of guys waiting to help. They were all prepared for the morning weekend rush and they were all cordial.   Every time I go and they don't charge me they just say 'tell your friends about us'. So Yelp friends, if you need a tire issue resolved, go to these guys.

A nice little trendy spot inside Planet Hollywood. Prices were actually okay for Vegas. Our drinks could have been stronger and the food was decent, but our server was awesome. You have to order chips and salsa, it isn't provided.

I don't think Disney is the happiest place on Earth. I think the Container store is. Friendly people, good service, bright and obviously clean store... It's worth going just for fun and looking around. Pricey yes, but they have every sort of storage bin or shelf you could want to organize literally any room in your home. You will find things you had no idea you needed until you saw them. I had great customer service here, and I highly suggest signing up for their reward program, I randomly got 15% off my purchase last night (you get some kind of reward every month).

For me the food here is 5 stars. I love the options and the quality is always on point. They have so many vegetarian meals and are very open about the nutritional content of the food. Bakery items are pretty tasty for a chain bakery. This location is just so very busy. I have always waited in long lines and the layout is poor. People waiting for food after ordering get in the way of people waiting to order or people trying to get drinks. To gos just take so long you might as well stay and eat (if you can find a table).

I've really become fond of the quirkiness of the Fox Concepts restaurants. True Foods is probably my favorite with Blanco a close second. I love the vegetarian options here and it doesn't make me feel like I'm cheating on my healthy eating habits. It isn't a perfect whole foods menu (they have things like pasta and bread and pizza) but lots of the menu items are vegetable centered and many things can be made GF.   Service was phenomenal. The waiter was attentive, food was out quickly, and a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. You always get an A in service from me if a manager is going around checking on customers!  I got the quinoa burger (still on my quest for the best veggie burger in PHX) and the flavor combinations were amazing. The burger was definitely a messy, eat-with-a-fork-not-your-hands sort of thing, but it was so good I didn't care. It came with a side of sweet potato hash, which was sort of cold, and a kale salad, which was also sort of cold, but tasted much better.   The place got busier as we ate, so the earlier you go the better if you don't want a wait. I think next time I'll try eating at the bar and get something off the drink menu, lots of interesting alcoholic options!

I've never actually been here, but my mother had a cake delivered to my office on Wednesday for my birthday. I obviously spread the joy and shared... people are STILL talking about that damn cake. When I picked it up from our admins desk I was surprised by how much the thing weighed - these are seriously moist cakes, people. The chocolate chocolate was delicious and the whole cake was cooked evenly (maybe these NBC people should give out tips for baking banana bread.. Mine is always gooey in the middle). For a place that I assume bakes mass quantiles of bundt cakes per day, the quality was fantastic. I won't take a star away, but I wish it said somewhere on the cake's paperwork (they included four different brochures/ads) who sent it!

Truly one of the best fitness studios I've found since moving to Arizona. A few months after moving here I found a Zumba place but it shut down over the winter and I never really found anything to replace it until now. I've only been able to try a few of the classes but I've felt very welcome and comfortable at all of them. I love that this place attracts a range of ages and sizes, and both men and women. I think the prices are pretty reasonable and the people who run the studio take their job seriously and really care about their customers and their business. I just wish they weren't located next to a pizza place, it really tests your self control!

I run on 2-4 cups of coffee a day (full time job + grad school + part time job = no sleep EVER) and as much as I love my Keurig sometimes you just need some real espresso. What makes Dutch Bros so special is the customer service. You would not expect a coffee place that seems to be run mostly by young college kids to take customer rapport seriously. They're all friendly, easy to talk to, and make sure you get your punch card stamped before you leave. I love the taste of their drinks, even though you might be waiting in a crazy long line to get to them. I think it's always worth tipping the workers because a medium drink and a tip here is still less than a grande drink at Starbs.

This was my first salon experience in PHX - I booked an appointment for highlights, cut and blow dry since I found a $50 for $75 coupon on Yelp. Not bad! The salon has a fun vibe and cool decor. I was offered a drink when I checked in. The appointment started a little late, but I think I was still out in about 2 hours. My favorite part was my stylist didn't try to convince me to buy every product she used (as many salons do!).  I wanted to wait a few weeks before reviewing to see how the color help up - being blonde, sometimes salons user cheap products and dyes and my hair gets a brassy, orange tint over time. Not the case here! The color looks natural and hasn't faded in the last few weeks. I would definitely return for highlights, especially if there's another Yelp deal.

I've been to several Message Envy locations and was really disappointed here. The massage itself was fine, but the staff pushes memberships so hard it ruins the experience. I declined, politely, several times before my massage and then after while checking out to sign up for a membership. Instead of accepting my answer, the same girl kept asking, and when I finally thought I got through to her that I would not be signing up, she asked me what my reasons were for not being a member. Really? I don't know if memberships are a commission incentive or what but it was obnoxious. It was also super uncomfortable. I don't have to explain why I don't want to sign up for your membership. I just want to get my once-a-year-massage, pay, and leave.

This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix. Service is pretty standard but the food is just phenomenal. The fish is fresh and beautifully plated. I'm always sad when I finish a meal here because I don't want them to end! The music playing is always fun and and they serve the best bread while you wait for you food. They also have good happy hours and offer a Yelp check-in offer (as of May 2015).  Bonus: they're next to the Total Wine store.

I wanted to just have the brie+fig jam+apple bruschetta with wine for lunch, but my mom said that was not an appreciate meal for a Monday afternoon. So I also got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about but the bruschetta was out of this world. If you're interested in coming here I suggest just having an appetizer dinner and sampling all their different bruschettas. I'm guessing this place is totally different at night than it was during a week day lunch and I plan to return to check out the environment... and have more wine.

Beautiful food presentation, good service. My family really enjoyed the comfy outdoor seating. The portions were small but considering I was going shopping/trying on clothes after dinner that's probably an okay thing.   We loved the little pretzel rolls and fondue as an appetizer. I'm pretty faithful to a vegetarian diet but since my parents were in town and they 'don't believe in the whole not eating meat thing', I obliged their request to eat fish and got the salmon. As guilty as I felt eating it... It was pretty good.   Like most of the Fox Concepts restaurants, the bar looked like a lot of fun. I think next time I visit I'll just Uber over and drink my dinner.

Thank you Yelpers for leading me here! Marcia is great! Not only is she fun to talk to but she seriously knows how to sew. Plus her shop has the kinda place you just want to hang out. She did a great job changing the fit to one of my dresses and fixing the length of another. It's always fun to look back behind her work space and see what other projects she's working on too. She can do basic hemming and take on crazy projects that change the entire look of a piece you bring in. I will definitely be bringing her more dresses and tops to adjust!

Okay, let's talk about 'uncomfortable' stuff for a sec. Ladies, your uterus is a part of your body. Just like your stomach. Or your elbow. Or your eyes. Talking about elbows does not make people feel awkward, but talking about uteruses (uteri?) does. Whatever. You need to take care of all of your body, no matter what part or name. Dr. G is a fabulous GYN who makes sure your reproductive system is happy and healthy. I had never seen a male GYN before and was extremely nervous the first time - which was a waste of my energy because I had nothing to be worried about. He's easy to talk to, pretty funny at times (I don't think he means to be actually), and there's always always a female staff member in the room with you during exams. He's had a lot of experience in the uteri world and he works quickly so you're annual well woman exam isn't draw out and nothing to dread.  The office staff alone is worth a five star rating. I love the front desk girls. They help me out with billing. They dealt with me creating and canceling and IUD insertion appointment about 3 times because I kept chickening out (and were super nice to me when I did indeed get the IUD and proceeded to faint). They're all basically rockstars at their jobs. Yelp originally lead me here and this review is long overdue.

I'm a little biased because I used to work at a sushi restaurant in Saint Louis during college, and to be honest this place teetered between a 3 and 4 star ranking. The sushi was good, but not the best. There's a lot of deep fried rolls.. This place was definitely redeemed by their all day happy hour on Sunday (decent selection of rolls that are half off!) and the servers were super friendly. I'll come back to Stingray, but I think I'll try a few other sushi bars in the area first.

Yum! I am on a quest for the best Phoenix veggie burger and my burger here is on the top of the list so far. You can add just about anything to your burger (and any of the themed burgers on the menus can be swapped for a veg patty) and they have a big variety of fries to choose from too. I got the sweet potato fries with dinner and they were great, especially dipped in the yogurt sauce they come with.   Service here is phenomenal - really friendly hostesses and bar staff. I loved the indoor/outdoor bar and they turn the heaters on at night if you want to sit outside even when it's a little chilly.   Only downside - this place is a little pricey. For a beer, fries, and burger my total was about $25 before tip. It's not your average cheap burger joint, it's defiantly a fancy deluxe restaurant with a casual vibe. Just go close to pay day.

I love fired zucchini. Almost as much as I love falafels. This place serves fried zuc as an appetizer and it is just to die for. I come here becuase I actually crave huge plates of fried zucchini fries and a side of their pesto ranch.   Oh, and be careful not to totally ruin your dinner because they serve bread here too. Amazing, hot out of the oven bread with Italian seasonings and lots of butter. This is a rough place to visit if you're an emotional eater or craving carbs or PMSing or all of the above.  Service can be hit or miss, but usually it's pretty average. Depending on when you visit there might be a wait, though it's a pretty large dining area and the turn around time is decent. I know this is an Italian restaurant I've never actually had their pasta - my go to is the salmon salad with the pesto ranch. It is definitely not a healthy salad, so if that's what you are wanting, have them put the dressing on the side.. they are very generous with it!

Killer donuts. They're fluffy, not too greasy, and the frosting is delicious. I got a coffee with my breakfast and the girl behind the counter asked if I wanted cream and sugar.. I said yes - I don't know what ratio she used of each but it was almost perfect mix.   But why, WHY, do they charge extra for people who pay with debit/credit card? It's 2015! I'm a millennial, I have cash on me once a year when my great aunt sends me a $5 bill for my birthday. The rest of the year I buy things with ApplePay or debit card. I don't think I'm the only person who doesn't carry much, if any cash, these days. Really silly. At least waive the fee after someone buys a certain amount of donuts.

SO much fun. Great for any level painter. I think the pricing is really great for all that it includes - materials, a drink, and clean up. You just show up, drink, paint, and then leave! The entire staff is so friendly. Great for girls night out!

First of all, get reservations because we tried to get in here for weeks. It was well worth the wait, but seriously, book ahead. One of my best restaurant experiences in Phoenix so far, for so many reasons.   Star 1 for not having to park my car! I am ALL ABOUT complimentary valet parking, it was so nice to drive up to the door and hand over my keys.  Star 2 for service. Our waitress was genuinely friendly and super knowledgable about the menu. She obviously had the wine menu memorized and knew which ones were organic (I don't really care about organic wine as long as it has alcoholic in it, but I'm still impressed) and where they were from. My family had never been to North before and she brought us some grilled bread to try too. Which brings us to:  Star 3 for food quality! They make their own pasta and bread in house. And everything tasted fresh and was plated beautifully.   Star 4 was for food taste. Because damn, it was all good.  Star 5 for atmosphere. My family is not the 'sit around and enjoy each other' kinda family. We go out, we eat, we leave. This is the kind of place you want to spend some time hanging out, enjoy your wine, and sit a while. The food wasn't brought out super quickly but that was actually okay because then we had some time between appetizers and entrees.   Well done, Fox Restaurants.

I don't now if I can write a fair review since my significant other and I stopped by at two pm in the middle of summer and were literally the only people there BUT we had a nice time. Cheap beer, some cool drink selections, and the bar guy was nice. We got a flatbread which was pretty good too. It's not five star pizza but it hit the spot and it was a good price. If we move to Tempe this would be somewhere we'd visit again!

I'm still salty about my last Massage Envy experience and their non-stop begging for me to join their wildly expensive membership even though I declined to about twenty times. I found this place on Yelp (duh) after a long day at the office and decided to give it a shot.   They took me last minute on the same day I called. The massage started with my head and neck while my feet soaked. Then after working down my arms they moved on to massaging my feet. I actually really liked being able to keep my clothes on and their little massage beds are crazy comfy. Even dressed I feel like I got a deep massage. And the foot rubs are the real deal - as someone with fallen arches I was super grateful for the amount of time spent concentrating on my sore feet. After the feet they have you flip over and rub your back.   The only downside is you are not in a private room for your massage - they have two beds per room and the rooms are just separated by a curtain. If you show up for a massage with your SO that's great... but otherwise you might share a room with someone else. The staff is pretty quiet and they play nice slay music so that helps. You can also hear people walking in and leaving, and possibly the person a room over from you snoring. It isn't perfect but for a $30 one hour massage I think that's a okay trade.   FYI they accept both cash and cards but prefer cash, but I believe tips are only supposed to be in cash.

Amazing customer service here! The girls were friendly and very helpful when I was looking to replace an old bag. They even looked online for an item they no longer had in stock for me. I've always been happy with MK's corporate customer service (if you ever have an issue, call their service line and you will be able to talk with a real person almost immediately!) but the girls at this location were just as great. I will definitely be coming back next time my budget allows!

I really enjoy stopping by SEED on my way to work and getting a smoothie. As nutritious as they are, they don't taste bland or gross. Going here for a quick drink makes me feel like I'm starting the day off right. Someday I'm hoping to try some of the burritos on the menu. Or maybe go to the spin classes in the building associated with them. This is definitely worth stopping by and checking out if you want something quick and healthy!

Build a hummus bowl with your favorite grains and veggies? Um, yes please. This place is just awesome - the food is delicious, the staff is seriously nice, and it's very friendly to people who are veg or vegan or GF. It's also a great amount of food for the price. This is one of those restaurants that just makes you feel good after you eat there.   Bonus: I know 99.99999% of the population doesn't care about the celery content of their food, but I am severely allergic and it was a huge relief to be told no celery is used anywhere here!

It's hard to review places like this because no one ever goes here because they want to - you usually have to because it's a minor issue or your GP can't see you same day. I've never been to an urgent care in a good mood because I'm, you know, sick.   This wasn't a particularly fast urgent care, and no one was at the front desk when I checked in.. That was odd. But I was eventually greeted and taken back after waiting for a while. I really appreciated the friendly staff that took me back for bp and weight, and the PA on the clock was very kind and took my concerns seriously.  By the time I left with my RX I had been there for about two hours.   So bottom line: the wait sucks but the service is worth it if you really feel bad.

Yum! I've been on a Greek food kick and when I needed some falafel for lunch last week this hit the spot. Try the rice!   The place is new, clean, and they have a large menu. I just remember being shocked by the price - it's sort of fast food, the prices just seemed high.  Bonus - they keep LOTS of Sriracha bottles around!

Don't be afraid of the menu here. At first glance I got a little nervous - I'm a pretty open minded person when it comes to food but frog legs and squid ink pasta sounded intimidating. Try something new or ask for a recommendation - everything I tried here ended up being delicious. The homemade hush puppies were an instant favorite.   Everything else here in addition to the food was  amazing. Good customer service (they are very careful about food allergies, thank you!) and unique environment. Probably more of a place for late eaters. It really isn't that hard to find, it's combined with The Yard and Culinary Dropout, which has a big sign as you approach it and they have free valet parking. It's fun to be able to look out at The Yard while you eat.   I wouldn't take a star away for the price, but be ready for a high bill. Two entrees with two glasses of house wine and an appetizer and a tip can hit the triple digits here. After dinner we debated if the cost was because we were paying for high quality food or if that was just an obnoxious popular restaurant thing. We decided that when it comes to seafood we'd rather splurge on super fresh, tasty fish than risk the cheap places.

Serious kudos for the staff here. Our waitress was so sweet and brought us a 'sample' of something my mom saw on the menu but wasn't sure if she wanted to order as her meal. The rest of the staff was friendly and the food was good! Lots of creative breakfast choices plus traditional favorites.   Obviously this place is a hit so the earlier you go the less likely you'll have to wait.

This is a very basic gym: cardio machines, some weights, and a pre-made 30 minute circuit. There's also tanning and hydro massage beds. Nothin fancy, but if you're like me and just want a clean place to get some cardio in a few times a week, this place is great for the price. I actually like this gym because it seems to be a 'gym for average people' and it's nice to work out with all ages and all shapes and sizes.   The pizza and bagel thing - it's not every single week so if you're worried this (actually kinda clever) marketing scheme might thwart your fitness regime it isn't too hard to avoid. I think it's like once a month.   I've been a few times and some of the staff actually greets me by name and they're all pretty nice. I tried to sign up originally at a different Planet Fitness and the front desk guy was super rude - I'm glad I ended up at the Tempe location!

It's like Chipotle for pizza! If you're a fan of thin crust, this a super yummy, reasonably priced place. My pizza was about $7, which is two meals for me. My coworker and I were also able to go in, order, and eat, with plenty of time to spare during out lunch hour. So worth the calories.

Love this salon so much! Very clean and everyone is super friendly. I think the prices are fair - you're paying for salon quality work with pros. I think they take walk ins but I usually call ahead. I've never had my hair done here but my mani pedis are always perfect. They don't use those cuticle clippers that can can cut you or those feet shaver things. Everything is sanitized and non-scary. I always get solid colors on my nails but someday I'll have to get some nail art, the pictures I've seen are so impressive!

Some of the best customer service I've had at a restaurant! The girls working here were so sweet and very helpful describing the menu and suggested drinks for certain foods. Oh and the food is crazy good - order their homemade potato chips as an appetizer! I love that the entrees here are all fresh and healthy and actually reasonably priced. The parking situation is kind of crappy - there's about five total spots in their little lot but you can always park across the street and walk!

Teetering between 3&4 stars.. So I really like the pizza here. No questions about that, everything about their ingredients and flavoring is top notch. And their cranberry Apple gorgonzola salad is the bomb dot com.   Pricing is a little weird - you can't order a specialty pizza without a certain topping. They come exactly as they are. If you want even just a slight variation from a specialty pizza you have to build your own and pay per topping. Not a good or a bad thing, just an FYI.   Service is just okay. The host was awesome but our waitress clearly went out for a cigarette break multiple times during out dinner. I'm not a health freak and sometimes even I'll have a drag when I'm feeling angsty and drinking a cold beer, but I do not like smelling cigarettes while I eat. It was like a little Marlboro cloud came around every time food and drinks were brought over or taken away. It took my back to my high school days working at TGI Fridays - we always had the pre shift meeting outside so the team could have a cig before the dinner rush. You're classier than that Spinato's.

My first experience with Blanco was actually at a little one in the airport that I ate at on my way home from Phoenix. I fell in love with my food, especially the rice! Now that I've moved to AZ I make sure to keep Blanco in my restaurant rotation.  The atmosphere is really fun, perfect for date night. Great design, lighting, and layout. The drinks are good and they actually have some really interesting vegetarian options on the menu. Last month I got mushroom tacos that were fabulous!  Being a 20something who works, I tend to eat later than most people and usually my boyfriend and I just go to the bar. The place is often busy so if you want to go around super time don't be surprised if there is a wait.   Just go, order some guac and a marg and enjoy the setting!

Good food at a great price, and obviously the vibe/decor is fun, but the service here was lacking. Only two people were working tonight (7pm on a Saturday) and there was a long line that moved very slowly. The dining room really needed to be attended to and have tables wiped down, but no one checked on it during the 45 mins or so my friend and I ate and talked, even after the food line slowed down and we were the only people left there. Aside from the service it was a fun little trip up north, I'd go back next time I'm in the area, I just hope they're better staffed!

Okay, let me make this review as simple as possible: Flower Child is like the trendy (and expensive) love child of Panera. You walk up and order, then seat yourself and they bring food out. So many healthy options, many vegan or vegetarian, and the wine is organic. This location is sort of loud, but great for people watching. Be prepared for you meal to be in the $15ish range.

Good sandwiches (with vegetarian options) and fun flirty guys to make them. Actually I lied, I've never had an actual sandwich, just the wraps, but they're killer. I love the veggie wrap - I feel like they use fresh veggies and the tortillas are soft. They're out of a bag, but still good. The only bummer for me is this place is a little pricey.

I love the associates who work here. They are always swamped, but they're still friendly; they say hi when you walk in the door, ask how you are, ect. This is a very busy location and a really fun place to people watch if you've got some time in the morning.   My only complaint is the parking, some days the drive thru line gets so long it blocks in the cars sparked in the parking lot. I think parking and going in is faster than driving thru so I try and park a little ways away (near the Italian restraint) to avoid this.

Full disclosure: I didn't try the meat because, well, I don't eat land animals. My Midwest family got some smoked turkey and pork sandwiches and the consensus was that their lunch was "Good, but expensive."  We came here because we are a Saint Louis people and Saint Louis people 1 apparently love BBQ and 2 love scouting out other Saint Louis people, and this place is run by a STL family. I grabbed a salad, average, but was impressed with my green chili mac n cheese (it had corn and red peppers in there too!) and the gooey butter cake. No one can make gooey butter cake like my mom, but this was pretty good.  The inside design was cool and the kids staffing the counter were friendly and talkative. Pretty much everything is ala cart. If you like meat and eating in places with that smoke house smell and you aren't on a budget this is a good place to try.

SO. GOOD. This place is small and easy to drive by, but the Yelp reviews drove me in. I'm a sushi snob who spent some time (aka the best summer of my life) working in a sushi bar. I love that this place has basic rolls plus some truly unique specialty rolls. I'm so glad to see they don't have too many deep fried rolls - that trend annoys me immensely. Prices are good for the quality and they have both happy hour and reverse happy hour. Sushiholic does not take reservations and they get busy - there is a pretty small seating area so either show up early or be prepare to wait.

I'm gonna say it - I like this place more than a certain other build-it-yourself pizza place down the road. It's bigger, with a nice atmosphere and more room for people waiting in line. Super friendly staff. There's a good amount of seating. The pizza crust is thin but not too dry or crunchy, probably my favorite part. Mod has a huge menu (but really you could probably just walk up and say what sauce you wanted with your toppings) and I really appreciate them posting the calories next to each pizza type. Pricing: I think I paid $10 for pizza and a non-alcoholic drink. I only ate half the pizza, so now I have lunch for tomorrow and it became two meals for me, not bad.

I hate when people compare restaurants, but I'm gonna do it. Matt's is in many ways the opposite of Snooze - it's quieter, the menu is simpler and pretty classic. I loved the decor and fresh flowers in the tables, it wasn't too trendy or trying to hard. You seat yourself. It has a very small business feel to it. The staff was friendly and attentive. I saw a manager on the floor all morning working with them. The food was pretty good - again, this isn't Snooze, so don't expect anything out of this world crazy. Think basic omelettes and waffles.  They have a rotating daily special: Monday's are huevo rancheros, another day is biscuits and gravy, ect.  I think my family's disappointment came with the price - they charge a lot for little things. An extra side of syrup cost an additional $1.50. That just seemed ridiculously expensive. My dad thought it was a marketing ploy to make the pancakes a little dry purposefully so you'd have to order more syrup. Dorky MBA family humor. But seriously. A dollar and a half for a little dinky thing of syrup is too much.

Too much fun! My mom and I stopped by after reading the good reviews. By accident we showed up right before the performer hit the stage. How fun is it to be eating dining while watching Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and Johnny Cash performances, all by the same guy?  The service here was really phenomenal. While there wasn't an obvious hostess stand, we were greeted quickly after coming in and asked if we wanted to sit on the 'noisy side' or the 'quieter side' (basically, did we want to sit near the little stage near the bar or in a separate dining room). I think all the staff members came over at least twice to check on us and they were super friendly, sharing their favorite dishes and telling us to stay and watch the performance for as long as we wanted after they cleared our plates away.  Their food was yummy! I loved my 'cream cheese angles' (cream cheese rangoons basically) and the fried rice. I don't eat meat but I know what good meat looks like - my mom's plate looked like high-quality white meat chicken. They have a pretty traditional Chinese restaurant menu with lots of vegetarian options. It isn't super fancy but it tastes good! Definitely worth a visit, make sure you go in time to catch a performer. The atmosphere is really what makes this place!

The Yelp reviews are spot on: The pizza here is de-lish. If you're in Arcadia its a local spot well worth trying. The pizza has a thick crust that isn't dry (Im a Missouri girl who loves flat STL style pizza so if I'm impressed with thick crust that means its truly impressive). They pile on the toppings and there are all sorts of fun pizzas including some southwest style pies with a spicy sauce. Management is super friendly - you can tell the owner has a great rapport with the customers coming in. Next time you're craving pizza close down your Dominos app and go support this yummy local pizzeria.

Like others have said - this place has potential, it isn't what it could be. I love the vibe here, good music and decor. I thought this was a sit down restaurant for some reason but it's more set up like a Panera or Flower Child were you order and take a number to a table. That's fine, but why do they only have one cash register/cashier during brunch hours? Kind of a wonky way to run a restaurant that would obviously be busy on a weekend morning. I ordered, the hipster staff was friendly, food came out pretty quickly. It was yummy, simple food. This isn't the kind of brunch where you walk away hating yourself and clutching a food baby - it was filling and healthy in a way that made me feel good about myself and life choices in general. Probably because my eggs were topped with kale and salmon, not oozing with cheese. The plate was good in general except for the toast, which was.. Stale? I think? I couldn't cut it with my knife, whatever that means. Less carbs I guess. The other drawback was the price; I'd been warned by Yelpers beforehand so it wasn't a totally shock when I paid $15 for my breakfast and coffee. For that kind of price I would expect better quality things like bread and a less weird cashier set up. I'll come back, there are other things on the menu I'd like to try, but it'll have to be close to payday.
