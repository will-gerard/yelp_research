50% off Saturdays today.  Cant beat the deals.  It smells funny here and be careful to not sit on an old couch.  If your looking for cheap this is your place.  Bought a few tennis rackets for $2.

I rarely find a place that fills me up for lunch...and this place did.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken flatbread/pita...it was really good.   the atmosphere is great.  The service is great.  The food is great.  It has a "hipster" vibe to it...so if your not hipster make sure to borrow a pair of thick dark rimmed glasses and maybe some skinny jeans before you go.  You will fit right in.  Unless your really overweight...then pass on the skinny jeans.  Maybe a pair of old Levi 501's would work.  But don't wear camouflage...they might think your the plumber.

Pleasantly surprised.  My wife and I received a few gift cards for this place...as we had never heard of it.  We didn't expect such a great experience.  I had combination fajitas which were great...I wish they would had more of a marinated sauce for the fajitas though...but they were excellent...plus and endless supply of sides.  My wife had a few enchiladas and loved them.  The atmosphere is neat and prices are good.   The only negative part is that grilled onions do a number on my bowels....let's just say the rest of the night was quite explosive.

Very frustrated with delivery from this place.  The pizza is great if you pick it up.  But they have the worst service.  We ordered and it took over 2 hours and we still didn't have a delivery.  I had to make a call at 1 hr 30 minutes in so they can let me know that the driver got in a car accident...and that someone was just picking up the pizzas to deliver them.  We only live 5 minutes away.  We waited another 30 minutes and still no delivery.  I talked with Eric the manager who did apologize, however I shared that it might be a good idea to call and let your customer know.  After that he said it would be right there and was going to send me pizzas that had been sitting for over an hour.  That is very bad business.  We waited another 20 minutes (again I live only 5 minutes away) so I eventually called back and just cancelled the order and called Barros.  It's so frustrating because the pizza is good here.  This isn't the first time this has happened with this place...another time we ordered (not the thick crust--which does take an hour) but a regular thin crust and it took over an hour.  This is my first negative review and I apologize but it's almost 9pm at night and my family is really hungry.  I hope they can get their act together.

Okay...so I have to write an update because this is just strange.  I have to say that the general manager did call and gave me a 20 credit for pizza which is an obviously nice gesture if I wanted it.  HOWEVER....they actually charged me on the night I ordered and assured me it was voided.  I called back twice and each time they said the void should be coming through at anytime, it should take a few business days (which it was way after a few days).  SO I still have a $30 debit on my account.  I just called again tonight and was told I would have to call tomorrow between 3-5 to get it taken care of.  Really?  I have made about 7 calls to Rosatis to deal with this problem without a solution.   But hey...they have great pizza.

Grimaldis has great pizza!  We love the authentic flavors of the crust and sauce.  My son and I can split the large mo problem.  The crust is thin and crispy.... Not thick.  If you are looking for fresh tasting pizza you need to try it out.  Cost is a little more than average but worth it because of quality. Also the wait staff rocks.  They took care of us and we never had an empty glass.  They were very friendly and we were greeted many times walking in and leaving. If you can sit on the patio.. Even better.  Its a great environment!

Very good. I didn't think the custard and ice mix would be that good, but it turned out to be great.  You can mix and match different flavors and the workers are fun and love to suggest new mixes.  Way better than frozen yogurt. Give it a try. Be careful when taking it to go.  We have had leaks from the cups a few times because the lids seem to not stay on tight.  There nothing colder than having ice cherry all over your pants.

I am biased.  I love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  The wait staff is great.  My glass in never empty and the chips keep coming.   It is priced a little high...but well worth it to me.  The quality of the food is great and the Carne Asada is a favorite. The El Capitan Torta is amazing.  I can eat about 6 of them without blinking. That's why I'm fat.

Went to T-mobile last night to take advantage of the new "we will payoff your early termination fees if you switch over to us" deal.  I walked in and was greeted immediately even though there were other customers in the store.  The staff was very attentive.  Steve helped me out..at first I was unsure of Steve, but once he started talking we had great conversation and he answered all of my questions.  We laughed a lot and talked about different phones.  I ended up with 4 brand new phones and a better plan at a cheaper price than Verizon.  It was a great deal.  The staff even stayed late to help us out. A big kudus to Steve and the other young lady (I forgot her name!) that helped us out.  You guys did a great job and I appreciate all your had work.  Staff like this will make T-mobile succeed!
