I went to this kohls due to just moving to this side of town and I needed to finish my baby registry I had started online. I went to customer service and the woman there did not seem know what I was talking about, she called her manager over who seemed confused as well. I explained I just need to log into my registry and be given a scanner to finish. The manager gave me a scanner and had me log in, she didn't say much at all. I went to start scanning and I was surprised of how little the baby department was, everything was so unorganized and scattered everywhere, also the scanner was having issues scanning items period. I probably scanned 10 items and gave up.  I returned the scanner to the manager and again she said nothing. I went to shop a bit in be home section, nothing was where it's price label was at, so I was scanning items at price check every time I found something that interest me. I gave up and went to jewelry where a man who obviously didn't work there was behind the jewelry counter with a young women having a personal conversation about showing him what was in the locked area. I was carrying a wooden wall piece and decided to ask a cashier at the men's side to hold it for me while I tried to find a necklace since it didn't fit in a cart, the cashier seemed confused and asked how long I needed it held, I explained I was just needing help cause I can't carry much being pregnant so maybe 20 minutes, she grabbed my item and placed it by her area. I went and grabbed a necklace and waited in line to pay along with three other people. The cashier who was holding my item had paged for more cashiers for help in the men's side. There were three girls behind the customer service socializing and one wasn't even behind the counter working, she had just walked up talking to the others. So that leaves my cashier alone with a line of customers. I could tell the other customers were irritated but being patient, the cashier was waiting on a price check for an item. Once customer asked if she could be rung up in the meantime and the cashier said no. Still the other coworkers did not look over to help but stayed laughing at customer service with each other. After about 10-15 minutes the line started moving cause a young girl from customer service came over to open a register. I left in the most stressed out mood, I honestly think I'll take my time to drive to the Northern Ave Kohls location before visiting this one again. I've always had a good experience at kohls and been a card holder for years but wow it's never ever been like how this store came off last night. I removed my baby registry in result due to nothing appealing and the process being so difficult.

I've been to this Sonics twice now and each time I've been disappointed. I've always loved the slushes and just moved to the Avondale area so this is the closest location for my family. First time I ordered slushes and meals, the chicken strips I ordered were hard and the meat was so dry as if they were over fried. The slushes were also served more melted than what they're supposed to be and the whip was mixed in as if they were sitting for a while. The second time we got slushes and some mozzarella cheese sticks and corn dog, the four cheese sticks had no cheese in them when we ate them and the corn dog was hard/dried I didn't even finish it was so disgusted. Again, over fried and the slushes melted down.  Needless to say we won't be returning to this location and will drive the extra time to another.

I had ordered some raspberry macaroons for a party and they were delicious! This was my first time at this bakery, I went with my husband who ordered a cannoli. He has tried many and claims these are the best he's ever had. The bakery smelled amazing and I wanted everything as I walked through it. They wrap everything to go neatly Ina. White box with hand tied ribbon, intense technique. Definitely come her for baked goods and fresh bread.

Great food! The environment is so authentic and staff is very professional, nice and presentable. I've been to both locations, love the live music and comfortable environment. I ordered taco plate and my friend ordered fish tacos which she said were the best she's had, my sister ordered the spinach with cheese enchiladas. All very good and prepared neatly, highly recommend this place if you're craving some good Mexican food.

I am a member but had my first prenatal massage this week and it was the most amazing massage I've ever had. The pillows to support my body were so comfy and the room was cold which was perfect since I'm always so hot. Every concerned point I had was addressed and I felt no aches after just ready for a nap. Very satisfying. Lorraine was my therapist and I would def recommend her.

I am a member but had my first prenatal massage this week and it was the most amazing massage I've ever had. The pillows to support my body were so comfy and the room was cold which was perfect since I'm always so hot. Every concerned point I had was addressed and I felt no aches after just ready for a nap. Very satisfying. Lorraine was my therapist and I would def recommend her as a therapist.  As a office... The past two Sunday's my prenatal appointments have been cancelled within 15-20 min of each appointment. Once due to the staff incorrectly scheduling my prenatal massage as a regular massage, I even got a confirmation phone call the day prior for my prenatal massage so I'm sure this could've been caught way earlier and not causing my morning to be inconvenient. The second time, I received a call canceling my appointment cause the therapist called in, I get things happen but I feel offices should have a plan b or offer something to customers to apologize for this inconvenience. The scheduler David who called both times to cancel me was apologetic but as if I was speaking to a robot. I will never go back to the Park West location and plan on canceling my membership and going to Elements Massage. Being pregnant I rely on these massages to relieve my stress and pain on my joints, canceling those appointments as I'm on my way is just unacceptable. I give this review 2 stars cause my therapist was great, just bad management on Massage Envy's part.

I've gone here once, my friends have always talked about it and cheap drinks so I gave it a shot. Booths were ripped, furniture was not taken care of and old or damaged, table was sticky I had to ask for a damp towel to wipe off, I was handed one to clean the table myself. I didn't even order food due to the smell and look of the environment, ordered one beer and left. Waitress was nice.

Amazing food! The fish fry is the best fried fish I've had, I didn't even need to use the lemon for flavor, the fish had it all on its own. I love the Irish vibe and drafts, the patio is relaxing. Great staff and security, never drama and drinks are reasonable price. I feel you pay for the scenery and atmosphere, totally worth it.

Amazing service, ordered the wings which were huge! Not battered and served "naked", the dry rub garlic Parmesan was yummy and the hot buffalo sauce. The cheesy bacon jalape√±o fries are the best ever!!! My sister got the honey chipotle boneless wings and she loved them. The mango lemonade was so refreshing and our waitress even offered to-go drinks which make any pregnant lady happy. The environment is clean and staff was all welcoming. The prices are decent and much to choose from on the menu. Not a huge dessert selection but the food itself fills you up and to take home for later.

First time here, I've been to my fair share of pho restaurants. I ordered the pho ga (chicken pho) I'm more of a brisket pho person, esp since I can't have raw meat being pregnant, there was no brisket on the menu. There was a cubed mignon beef selection but didn't appeal to me. The broth was very delicious, not the best I've had but close. The veggies were fresh and clean, staff was so nice and attentive. I would def come back and recommend this place.

Came here with a friend to get some dessert, ordered a custard with chocolate bits which was served to me melted. Literally could've just poured it out the cup like it had been sitting out for ten minutes already. I was very disappointed, go to Dairy Queen.

Great spot! Definitely my new nail salon since I've moved. Everyone was nice and attentive. I got a gel manicure for $25, the only reason why I give four stars is because the clean up around my nail wasn't 100% clean. But I am very happy with the overall results. I am definitely coming back.

Great service, a little by of a wait but this only means well since the food was amazing. Ordered the chicken fried steak and the gravy was delicious with chunks of sausage in it. The home fries were a little under cooked but the eggs are yummy. Great environment and the owner greets guests, serves beer and great selection from American to Greek foods, great breakfast spot.

I absolutely love the yellow curry with chicken from here, Thai hot. I was able to order through Yelp and my food was delivered within an hour. I recently went into the location to sit and dine, nice staff but a little lack of training from what I saw. The food is the reason I come back, everything is good and fresh.

Always satisfied here, my husband and I love boba and we get our lychee with fruit boba drink along with taro with boba, so delicious. Never tried the food there yet but I'm sure it's yummy.

Always satisfied here. Best prices pho in town, service on point and food is always delicious! I order the huge combination pho bowl usually but today I have an upset tummy so the 3B will do which is just meatball pho. Veggies are always fresh and soup hot, spring rolls are amazing as well. Inside a Asian market so you can shop after

I had my sectional cleaned which was bought from another owner and I was very happy with the results. There was pet dander and stains all over this sectional but once it was done cleaning it looked brand new! For the price and quality of their job, I will definitely use this company again for any carpet or upholstery cleaning!

I came here for my first prenatal massage and was definitely impressed. I've had many prenatal massages and recommend this place as first choice for all expecting mothers.  The office was very clean and the customer service was great! The room was very relaxing and the therapist knew what she was talking about, I am definitely coming back. For the service you get and the price this place is the place to go!

Every time I've gone here's never been drink specials, the environment is pretty cool very different, the Friday night DJ is the most random ever- house to 90's jams within no time just no real flow I guess. Bartenders are super serious, food was ok there was just nothing awesome that popped! The big beers are a hit and pretty cool, there needs to be some outdoor games for that huge patio.

First time here and I am very happy! I did not make an appointment and they fit me in, I got a gel manicure and it was exactly what I wanted. Staff was very professional and showed great dedication to their work. I would highly recommend this nail salon, I inly paid $25 for my gel manicure!
