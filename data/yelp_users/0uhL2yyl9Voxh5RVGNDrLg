Went for a breakfast invitation and the Casino had ample parking in the morning and plenty of shady trees.  There was lots of activity in the casino.  The breakfast was awesome, plenty of sweet beads and muffins, bagels coffee, tea and green tea. The staff was friendly and the rooms in this casino are from $50. Located just walking distance from the strip. The best thing free wifi and a fast connection that got them the fourth star.

This is a well hidden secret in Las Vegas its called the Hotel in Mandalay bay. This is a different building from the main Mandalay bay resort. Some of the great benefits I see are easy approach when you are driving in from LA .  Once you enter the main parking garage go down the elevators then just walk out from the entrance doors towards the north side of the parking garage and you will directly enter the Hotel. Most people enter the casino then its a very long walk to the Hotel. As this hotel is a compact building you do not see the hordes of people at the reregistration, as it is quick and simple process.  The  rooms are quite, beautiful and relaxing. I just love to stay in the room and enjoy the views.  There are many restaurants in the resort and you can find almost any kind of food. A tram connects the Hotel with other resorts nearby  and is free to use. The Mandalay Bay Convention Center, located nest to the Hotel  is one of the largest privately owned and operated convention centers in the world. The 1000000 sqft facility is owned by MGM Mirage. It is attached to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and adjacent to the Mandalay Bay Events Center.  Located on 11 acres, Mandalay Bay Beach provides the ultimate in aquatic relaxation. This world-famous playground offers a wave pool*, lazy river, three swimming pools, jogging track and 2,700 tons of real sand. One can book the rooms on-line quick and easy. The resort is clean and spotless.  There is no end to shopping as hundreds of shops are all around this resort.

My wife and I, along with our couple friends, stopped by Maggiano's as we were walking down The Strip. We ordered the Tomato Caprese for an appetizer that was very tasty, The dishes are massive in portion and the food is delicious!. Ordered the mozzarella and it was  delicious. Had the New York Strip Steak and the Veal Porterhouse and split both of them. The NY Strip and  the Veal Porterhouse was absolutely wonderful. It was perfectly grilled and  tender. Remember they  serve nice big portions so please share them. They always have Sinatra playing in the background. Two people were roaming playing songs for you.

This was a family outing in Las Vegas , decided to have brunch in Raffles which is inside Mandalay Bay Casino. The server was from Kashmir and his name was Naveed  who was very helpful. I ordered the Waffles with walnuts and shared this  with my wife, her order was a omelet with hash browns. They served us coffee and this was among the best coffee I had ever had. Looking at the rest of the family I saw no one was able to finish their plates as the orders were large. So remember to share at this restaurant. The size of the portions is large. The casino has free Wi-Fi but the signal in this area was weak and downloading was slow.

Stayed at the Caesars Palace in the Octavius towers.  The Octavius Tower, a 668-room hotel tower. The resort's sixth tower offers a unique luxurious resort experience with a private entrance, separate hotel lobby and direct access to the Garden of the Gods pool oasis and gardens. Spacious guest rooms, starting at 550 square-feet, offers a modern, luxurious d√©cor incorporating earthy shades of browns, and grays. Marble-tiled bathrooms feature contemporary striped wall coverings, oversized whirlpool bathtubs and enclosed glass showers with multiple shower heads.  The location is in the center of the Las Vegas strip. So one can walk easily to nearby casino.  This was a wonderful experience and if you become members of the emperors club you get discount coupons in your email.  They charge no resort fee and in the Octavious tower Valet and porter services are free.

In Las Vegas if you need the cheapest gas look for Rebel. The best thing they accept credit cards. There is plenty of local traffic at the pump. All you have to do is drive on Flamingo towards the airport and at corner of  paradise and Flamingo this station is located. At $3.60 for regular the gas is a lot lower then California. The also have a mini mart.  So in Vegas look for Rebel for gas.

Rebel Gas was advertising at $3.69 on its Billborad but at the Gas Pump it was priced at $3.79  and seems like they were selling regular gas at their premium pump. Be aware of this take a alternate gas station . Misleading the consumer I can only give one star.

Was walking outside planet Hollywood and found this Panda. Ordered the single bowl you get a menu item and a side order for a total of seven dollars.  A family meal can be ordered for $9 for three items. This is cost effective fast food. They let you taste the food before you purchase. The size of this restaurant is small but service is same excellent service and food tastes great. I enjoyed my meal.

This is a wonder in the Sonaran Desert. The shell station is the cleanest with sparkling restrooms. The Arizona gas prices are a dollar less then California. The main attraction here is the metallic dinosaurs which lived millions of years ago when this desert was a rain-forest. They  sell many metal flowers and animals which look beautiful. Just because of this station we bypassed Phoenix and traveled on the nearly empty interstate 8.
