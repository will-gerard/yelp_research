I really hate going to the dentist but Dr. Ito makes it as enjoyable as possible.  He is professional, always runs on time and never rushes you if you have questions.  His staff is amazing!  I have very sensitive teeth and they never hurt me.  He has TV screens with a full selection of the latest movies and headphones to distract you from the cleaning.  When you have an emergency they get you in the same day and if you need a referral they will call the other Dr. to make sure you get seen immediately.  By far the best dental office in the Valley!

I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.   My family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!

This is the BEST nail salon around.  I visited after reading the reviews from other Yelpers and I have to say they were right!  The owners are a husband and wife who work together running the salon.  I have gel nails and have had them done at many places but this the first time I really felt like Nick cared about my nails.  He took his time, shaped them, filed them, was cared not to be rough and then even after another customer came in and was waiting did not rush to finish.  He took his time and made sure the coloring was perfect.  They are also way more reasonably priced than most places in the area.  If you care they do offer Vegan colors.  Plus they are VERY clean.  They clean everything right in front of you and put in the machine as soon as they are finished.  I can't recommend them enough!

OK, this is not a hole in the wall Mexican place but it will do.  The staff is usually helpful in making recommendations.

Nice family owned restaurant in Ahwatukee. The decor is a Paris style cafe with small tables inside and out as well as a lounge area.  The staff is friendly and the menu is large for their size. The menu includes a large variety of breakfast, lunch and dessert crepes.  The crepe is handmade at the time you order it.  The taste is very close to the ones I had in Paris.  My favorites are the bacon, egg and cheese and the Nutella and bananas.   A nice place to meet friends for a cup of coffee or to sit and read.

I don't normally write reviews about retail locations because I know a lot of the experience is tied to the staff which can change on a dime.  I had such an incredible experience at the Disney Store at San Tan Mall that I had to write about it.  I (along with half the world) got caught up in the Disney Doll Collection.  Since Chandler is the closes store to me that is where I went to get the first dolls in the collection.  Once the doll started to get popular I would get the mall two hours before opening and still not get one.  Chandler let each person by two dolls each so only 7-8 people would get.  I went down to San Tan where the manager saw the line and limited the dolls to one per person so everyone got one.   On the last release people camped out over night for a chance at the last 5 dolls.  Donna the store manager came out and made a point to talk with each person in line.  She made sure no one was holding spaces and everyone was planning on staying.  She had spoke with security to make sure the bathrooms were open all night and everyone was safe.   In the morning, she brought doughnuts for everyone and checked again to make sure everyone had stayed the night and no one tried to cut in line.  It was orderly and everyone who stayed got the dolls. A Big thank you to Donna and her team for a successful release.  I will be shopping at that store from now on.

All I can say is WOW!  We stumbled upon this restaurant completely by accident and I am glad we did.  My family (two adults and two kids, ages 9 and 11) were attending a concert at the US Airways arena.  Before the concert, we wanted a meal so we walked to another restaurant which had a very long wait.   We walked by The Arrogant Butcher and decided to try it.  We were all glad we did.  The meal started with a few appetizers.  My husband ordered 4 raw oysters and I ordered the pretzels and fondue.  I have to trust hubby who said the oysters were great because I was not about to try them.  The pretzel bites were to die for.  Completely fresh, warm, soft with a think, creamy cheese dip.  The cheese tasted much like the type I had in Italy.  The pretzels make the visit worth it.  For our main meals: I ordered the fish and chips, daughter ordered a cheeseburger, son ordered the king crab and hubby had the special of seafood cioppino.  All were much better than expected even after tasting the appetizers.   The fish was perfectly cooked with a side of amazing homemade coleslaw.  The cheeseburger came on a fresh bun with the meat perfectly cooked.  Hubby and son both loved their meals.  Service was good.  The only complaint I have is the kids ordered strawberry lemonade to drink and that is apparently a bar drink so we were charged for each refill.  I wish I had known that and  I would have ordered them a soft drink.    Atmosphere was fun.  Art deco with a bar seating area as well as tables.  The kitchen is open so you can see in.    A little pricy but not terrible for the area.  Cheeseburger was $9.00, Fish and chips was $12.00, 1/2 lb of crab was $18.00 and the special was $22.00.  We will be back.

The food was surprisingly good.  Being downtown I did not have high expectations but everything was good.  The fondue is a must!

I am sad about this place!   I really love local owned places and there are so few left that I really wanted to love WD.  I have been there twice and both times it was impossible to eat there.  I will say I do not drink coffee so I cannot comment on how good it is or isn't.  I live near by so my family and I have stopped in on our morning walks.  The first time my kids and I ordered smoothies and a breakfast burrito, bagel and a scone.  The food was worse than terrible.  The burrito was frozen and microwaved, the bagel was clearly some old Costco bagel and the scone was so hard my daughter could not bite it.  The smoothies were so sweet with some syrup they put in it that we all ended up drinking water.   Hoping the glitches were just the weekend they opened we waited and went back a month later.  Nothing had changed!   I think if you just want coffee and a table to chat or work on your laptop the place is OK.  The decor is nice and they have a few games for the kids.  There is free wireless (I think because I saw people on laptops).  If they change their food to be non-froze microwaved stuff I think it will improve the site greatly.  Get some fresh fruit, really smoothies, fresh baked items and they will reach a wider audience.

Love Flict!  Jinia Root is amazing with hair.  She gave my 12 year old an amazing hair cut and incredible pink highlights.  She was so thrilled it calmed her nerves about starting middle school.  I had no idea what I wanted done with my hair and Jinia was able to make it look modern but still easy for me to take care of it.  I love the color and the cut.  Call and make an appointment with Jinia.  You won't be disappointed.

Living in Ahwatukee there are not many places for a good traditional breakfast.  IHOP, Denny's, Crackers (Tried to kill us literally) so I am setting my bar low.  I have been in three times and all three were pleasant experiences.  The first time I ordered OJ and the protein pancakes.  The OJ was not fresh but it was fine.  The protein pancakes were excellent.  Service was slow for the drinks but fast for the food.  Everything was warm and cooked well.   The second time I went with two friends and ordered the two eggs breakfast with wheat toast.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns.  Both could have used some more salt and pepper but I was able to add that.  Service was good, a little slow but manageable.  The last time I went with my two kids and husband.  I ordered the same breakfast as above and it was good.   The place is brand new and clean.  My biggest complaint is the uniforms.  I am all for trendy but the tight. short shorts need to go.  My waitress shorts should not be shorter than her apron.   Jeans would be much more professional.   Compared to my others options this one is rated on top.  Also the last two times I have gone the place has been crowded.  I think they are working out the kinks of being new and this will be a good breakfast place.

The outside leaves much to be desired but they Dr is AMAZING.  I wish I could have him for my regular Ped.  We visited on a Friday afternoon when my oldest was sick and could not get into his regular doctor until Monday.  The building is old and the carpet is dark with very few decorations so I was a little unsure at first.  When we went back the Dr came in and immediately started talking to my son (12) and asking him all kinds of questions.  When my son asked questions back he took the time to explain what he was doing and what he was looking for.  He then spent a good 15 minutes listening his lungs, feeling his stomach, really doing a very detailed exam before he made any recommendations.  I felt very comfortable in his assessment and he was right on.  This will be my first choice for after hours or emergency going forward.
