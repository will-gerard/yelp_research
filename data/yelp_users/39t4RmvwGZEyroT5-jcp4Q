Overall, good experience. I took in my Ford Explorer and they took care of me very well. Jesus, the guy who helped me was EXTREMELY friendly, and offered great customer service. He walked me through everything, and even asked me if I was a SEAHAWKS fan because of my shirt, even though he is a fan of the evil Arizona Cardinals. Talking sports with a customer might sound trivial to some, but that kind of customer service goes a long way. He even walked me to my car and opened the door for me. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because I think they may be a tad overpriced. Worth it though.

This place sucks. Ordered a pizza BEFORE they were owed, got an email confirmation and everything, they never showed up. Never called. BUT THEY MADE SURE TO CHARGE ME!

Best place to get your hair cut. The music is cool, the monthly plan is awesome. Nancy is a wizard with shears and is the best thing to ever happen to my hair. GO REQUEST NANCY IF YOU WANT A GREAT HAIRCUT. AND MAKE SURE YOU TIP HER WELL.
