At lunch today I wanted sushi. Looked on Yelp for somewhere close. Found The Blue Fin. Read the reviews and decided to see how it was. With the light rail going down Central, if you are not on the right side of the road you have to go about a quarter of a mile to turn around. Traffic was light so no problem. Painted blue and white. Very bright colors shows up well. Gives you the welcome feel. It not really a sushi bar. They specialize in teriyaki but they do have two offerings of sushi on the menu. The place is small with seating inside and outside also. Since it is still warn in Phoenix this time of year I decided to eat inside. This place is maybe the cleanest place I have visited. It was so clean it almost hurt the eyes. No dust or dirt anywhere. Service was as good as it gets. I ordered a teriyaki rice bowel and since I wanted some sushi the spicy tuna roll and ice tea.  The cashier called over a employee and gave them my cup to be filled with ice tea. I could of gotten the tea but this is part of their service. My teriyaki bowel was delivered first. The food was good and really more there than one person needs to eat. My sushi came. It was also good. Then came more customer service. The lady that had filled my cup with tea was back asked if I needed more tea. I said yes and away she went with my cup. She refilled it with ice and then the tea. The owner then came up and asked if everything was ok. Nice touch.  A lot of the people coming in and out must eat there often as they were greeted with hello (their name).  So how was the food? The food was good and plentiful and inexpensive.  Would I go back? I have told many people about this place and if I was in the area, yes I would go back. The customer service was the best I have ever seen in a fast food establishment. Many places could learn a lot by going in and experiencing this good customer service.

Have now eaten there twice. Both times the meal was good.  From the front it appears to be a very small place. Once through the automatic opening sliding doors you enter a long room with approximately 100 + seats. Mirrors on the wall to the south and pictures of old Phoenix on the north wall. Open, clean, neat. I believe there is a few tables outside the sliding glass doors. But too hot to do that at this time of year.  Both times they had a special of the day for around $7.00. I got the daily special which was a sliced beef sandwich with fries, pickle, drink. I got some horseradish to go with it and enjoyed the meal.  The servers are not what I would call overly friendly but they have always been very nice had helpful. I am not always the easiest to help as I don't hear as well if there is background noise and usually need people to repeat themselves. They handled this well. No a hearing aid will not help this as they also amplify the background noise.  Why a 4. When you judge them with the other fast food places where you go in just to get a fast meal and go? They are much better than the run of the mill franchised sandwich shop.  Another nice thing is they buss the table.  I will more than likely eat there again.  Enjoy

Every year for the past three years we have celebrated Mothers Day at the Shriners Mother's Day Brunch.  There is nothing fancy. Just tables nicely decorated with seating for around 16 people. We take a table as there are now our family, and the families of my son's wife and the family of my daughters husbands family.  The food selection is second to none I have seen. Eggs fixed anyway you would want, pancakes, waffles with many toppings. Then there is prime rib, ham, turkey. All kinds of fruits and deserts. Aaaannndd you can eat till you pop.  Not sure how the arrangements for the brunch work? My son always takes care of that part.

I am retiring and was asked where I would like to go to eat for my retirement dinner.  I thought French. Looked on Yelp and found Coup Des Tartes. Reviews were good so that was my choice. Seven people went. My boss his boss who was paying, my wife and three friends.  We got two appetizers. Chevre/Tomate and Interesting Cheese. Both were excellent choices. I got the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad. It was OK but I would get something else next time. My wife got the Taleggio Salad and said it was very good. I was torn between getting the Ahi Tuna and the Lamb Shank. I asked the server and she said the Lamb Shank is one of the specialties. So I went with the lamb. Great choice. My wife has to be on a no meat diet so she had the Coup Veggie Pasta. She commented that it was excellent. Then came desert. By now I have had way more to eat than anyone should but I wanted to end this night with a desert. I had the Four Berry Tart. Great choice.  I am sorry I did not get the waitresses name. She was very attentive and helpful.  Dinner lasted from 6:30 to 9:30. Many stories about work and my 39 years with the company.  On leaving I had several people in the group come up and say what a good choice I had made. Everyone really did enjoy their meal. I will go back again. You should go also. You will not regret going the food is the best I have had in Phoenix to date.

My wife and I went here during restaurant week. I had been wanting to go here and give them a try and this was the incentive I needed. Our waiter Jorge was one of the best waiters I have ever had. He gets 5 stars. He was never in the way. He came to your table when you needed something almost like he was reading your thoughts. He was no where around but when I dropped a fork, he was there with another fork in 30 seconds. If you go you probably can't get the waiter you want but if you can ask for Jorge. You will be very pleased. During restaurant week they have some set menu items for a set amount of dollars. Of course you can still get what you want off the regular menu.  I don't remember the cut of beef I got but I got a steak and my wife got a Filet. She said hers was very good. I got mine rare. Most places think when you order rare you really want medium rare. They did cook the meat exactly the way I like, a little fleshy in the center. My steak was good but not excellent. A little tough. We ordered the green beans. This was a huge disappointment. I am not sure where this started but green beans need to be mature and cooked, not picked before there is a bean in it and warmed up. Yes I know this seems to be the way you get them everywhere. I was raised where you go into the garden, pick the beans, string the beans, break them into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces. When cooked they are to die for. But now everyone seems to think a immature half cooked bean is the way to fix them.  The potatoes were good and our deserts were good.  If they knew how to cook green beans they might of got 5 stars.  Have a great day enjoy good food.

I use Yelp a lot to find places to eat. My son suggested El Bravo because of reviews. Lots of good reviews. My wife and I  got there and was seated by a very nice lady.  I am going "good start". I may of just hit it on an off night. Nothing special about the decoration. Kind of plain could of used some cleaning. Very typical of some of the locally owned places where you can often get some very good food. My son and daughter arrives and it takes a while for someone to come and take our order. We get our drinks and wait and wait. Other people that came in after us have their food and are eating. Our drinks are empty and I have to ask to get refills. Ten min. later our waitress came out and said our food was being made. Ten min later we finally had our food. My son liked the Chimi, my wife and daughter liked their meal. Nothing exceptional, good. I got their cheese crisp Ole, again was good. There was not a lot of people in the restaurant so our long wait was not because they were to busy. I will probably not go back. There are a lot of places that do as well or much better closer to where I live.

Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning? 1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there. 2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us.  3. The food is priced reasonably.  4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business.  5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.) When we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good.  They have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people.

My wife and I go here about once a month and more often when the weather is nice. We prefer to sit outside since we usually take our dog with us and it is quite in their outside seating area. There is some traffic noise but never enough to interrupt a nice conservation.  We usually just get a bagel and a cup of coffee. Their coffee, I prefer the Neighbor hood blend, is  much better than the coffee shop they share their building with.  This is a place that can get crowded in the mornings. Be prepared to sit on the concrete wall out back or take it with you.  Love their bagels and coffee and some time away from the house where you can relax and talk.

Great selection nice sales people. I used to always buy two of most everything just in case I needed one again. I have since started to only buy only what I need because I can never find the extra one I bought.  I make frequent trips to the hardware store.  There are several hardware stores within a mile of me one of them being an Ace. They seldom have the part I need so I do not even go in the store anymore. Not a problem at the Ace at 51st. ave and thunderbird. Almost always have what I want. They also have things I need no one else in the valley have. I needed a metric tap and die and they were the only people that had the ones I needed. I had even tried on the internet with no success. I operate a small machine shop and they have had a lot of items I need to make parts for customers.  If you need hardware they will probably have it even the hard to find things.

Local owned business. Many reasons to visit. Beside about any kind of pet, farm animal food, they sell rabbits, chickens, birds, maybe reptiles, Could be much more in animals available. Any care products you would need to take care of them. Our grandchildren love a field trip to visit. If you have not visited and especially if you have small children and or animals, big or small give them a visit.

I have been shopping Treasures for several years. We recommend them to all our friends anytime someone asks about Jewelry.  I believe our first piece was to take my mothers wedding ring and use the stones and gold to make me a ring. We liked way the ring turned out and I have gotten many compliments. To have the ring designed and made was not near as expensive as you may think.  We now have 4 pieces they have designed just for us and many more that we have bought out of the displays. My wife had a ring she would not wear. We took it in and the ring was redesigned into a ring she now wears often.   You owe it to yourself just to go in and look. It is like being in an art gallery. There are many one of a kind pieces. When you look around the store you will see there are many trophies they have won for their design in local, state and national shows.   Just like all jewelry stores they have diamond jewelry. Well, I don't care much for diamonds. Yes, they sparkle. To me they don't hold much interest. I like the colored stones best and Treasures has the best selection you will find anywhere. The colored stones I like best are the ones that change color with the type of light that enters the stone. Sapphires and Garnets that change from a blue to green to burgundy. Most people don't know that some stones change color with the light and many of the few that do only think Alexandrite does this.   First thing many people think is I can't afford to have a piece made or go to a high quality Jewelry store like Treasures. Yes, I do go into other stores and look at price. You don't save much and may times pay more than what I would at Treasures. What you do get is quality and service when you buy from them. This equals value to me. I know what I bought is what I got. I have never gone away feeling as if I paid to much.   Everyone in the store will treated you well. I do have my favorites to work with as they know what styles we like and can show us what we may be most interested in. These are Scott the owner and Jessica his daughter.

Wife out of town. She does not eat sushi, so I thought this would be a good week to go out and enjoy. I know very little about sushi, just that I like to eat sushi. Went on Yelp and looked for a well review place near my house. I chose a place but when I got there the sign on the door said NOT on MONDAY. What to do. Pick a well reviewed place near to where I was. Fresh Wasabi was less than a mile away.  Decor? I guess typical of most I have been to. Clean friendly people. I was seated as soon as I got there as the place was not super busy. There were about 5 or 6 tables with people enjoying their meal.  I always have trouble ordering. I am learning but still need help. I asked my waitress what she suggested. I told her I wanted a verity. She suggested a combination of a tuna roll and about 8 other pieces of different kings of sushi. This ended up to be a great suggestion as I really enjoyed the meal. Way to much for one person to eat. (I did eat it all.) I was stuffed. Meal was served with soup and a salad. Both were excellent. My waitress was very attentive and kept my glass full of tea.  For being friendly, helpful. good food, nice quite relaxing meal? This was the best place I have visited (Lets say Arizona). If I want sushi on Monday this is the place.

We have been eating at Arriba's for many years. Their style of Mexican food is different from the rest of the restaurants. They claim to be New Mexico style. I am not sure exactly what that means since I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in Albuquerque and it is not like Arriba's. The real difference is Aribba's food is much hotter. They have several dishes with Hatch Chilies in it. This is what I come for. I love Hatch Chile. I used to bring suitcases full of Hatch Chile from Albuquerque, grill them and put them into the freezer.  Some times the chilies are a little hot other days it can be really hot.  Much of the time the chile is not that hot even though they will warn you when you order anything with Hatch in it. You can tell when the food enters the mouth just how hot it is going to be. Before the food touches your mouth you get that, this has the best flavor and it has not even hit your tongue yet.  Your next thought is this is going to be painfully hot. Water does not help. Four different times I have had Hatch that was almost to hot to eat. Take a bite, wait 10 min. before taking another. Unbelievably good. Unless you like it hot order something that does not have Hatch in it.  They serve corn chips with three sauces. Bean (This can be pretty hot at times), Salsa (This is usually pretty tame), then the hot sauce. It can be pretty hot but not near what the Hatch is.  They have daily lunch specials that are very reasonable. Every year they bring Hatch Chili in and roast them for you. Take them home put them in the freezer and when you fix you some soup put in a piece. Very Good.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Especial.  I am giving them 4 stars. The food deserves 5 stars the service at times is spotty. They seem to go through a lot of waiters and waitresses. Service is about a 2.5.  Give them a try! There are several of them around town. I have only been to the one at Arrowhead.

I used to travel 4o weeks of the year for work. While in Albuquerque teaching I used to take the class to Fuddruckers for lunch. Easy to get in and out and the burgers were good. Had not been to one in Phoenix for many years.   Recently we visited the one at Arrowhead. If you have not been they will cook you a burger plain or have your choice of added (beacon, mushrooms, peppers, Ect.) Then when you get the burger you put on the lettuce, tomato, more peppers, mustard, ketchup, Ect. You have a choice of Beef, Buffalo, Elk. Pricing is fair. You will not spend more than most hamburger places.  The decor is early american roads. (Road signs, old gas pumps,

My wife and I have been shopping from the time they opened several years ago. I don't remember when that was but quite a few years ago.  We have been fortunate to be able to travel and it is nice to have a place you can go and get some of the things you got while traveling. They have a good chocolate section where you can get chocolate from different countries. This can be seasonal and not always available. I don't drink much wine or beer but the selection seems to be good.  The people that work there are quite knowledgable about what they have and if they are out or don't carry have been helpful in helping us find the product we were looking for.  My experience has a been when I was looking for something and ask they just drop what they are doing and away they go with you helping you find what you need.  If you have not been? There are several in the Phoenix area. I always come here because I get good service,

It was 6:30pm and we had not eaten dinner yet. There was a discussion on just where we were going to eat. No decision was made so I just started to drive. I headed to restaurant row near 83 ave. and Bell road. Saw The Elephant Bar and decided to give it a try. I had eaten there but more than a year ago for lunch. We had to wait about  ten minutes for a table not bad since we came in at what would of been a busy time. We were seated and had to wait for several minutes before our waitress arrived. Longer than I had expected. Our drink order was taken and our food order was taken when they returned with our drinks. I ordered the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna salad, my wife ordered a side salad and the Mac and Cheese. She is on a low protein diet.  Silverware was delivered to our table. My knife was very dirty. They took the knife and brought me a clean one. Really looked like they just wiped it off and returned it.  I had asked the Ahi to be as rare they could do it. Raw was preferable. My wife's food came but not my food. Five to ten minuets later the waitress noticed I had no food and came over apologizing saying it was on it's way and would be ready in five minuets.  When my salad came the ahi was very done. So done the meat was starting to flake not quite white yet but getting there. I talked to the waitress when it was delivered about the condition of the ahi. She did apologize and volunteered to take it back. My wife was almost done with her meal by this time so I just asked her to leave it.  The manager came over and apologized for the over cooked ahi and offered to bring me another piece. I really did not want to wait and said I was OK. He left and came back in a few minutes and said he was going to send me a new piece of ahi. It was delivered in about ten minutes and was prepared the way it was supposed to be.  Somewhere above our drinks went dry. We was never offered a refill.  I would of given them 1 star except the manager really did try to make things better. The salad was very tasty. The ahi was just over cooked after I had asked for it to just be seared.  They got a low score because the food was not delivered to both people at the same time, the silverware was dirty, no refill on the drinks, food over cooked. Will I go back?? Probably but maybe just for lunch to get a sandwich.

We go here often but not as often as we used to. Just need to mix it up a bit.  We have always got exceptionally good food and service.  For Greek food, wraps, plates this is the place we aways go.  If you go during the lunch hour be prepared to wait on a table. There is outside seating but when the weather is cool, but some people do sit out side in the cool weather and hot weather. I like to get a table inside. The trick is to get there just before the lunch rush or just after the rush.  We usually get a meal with a large wrap and fries. We have them cut the wrap in half. This is plenty for two people. If you are in the area go see them. We have always been happy we stoppen in.

Jury duty has me in downtown Phoenix 2 days a week. I have never spent much time in this part of Phoenix and have made it my lunch time focus to find a good place to eat or places. I wanted a burger looked on Yelp. Coney Island Grill was close. I liked the feel of the restaurant. It is small and the tables have sewed vinyl tops to cover the tables. I liked this touch. Made the tables look very cleaned.  I went in and asked the gentleman at the cash register I was wanting a burger but did he have any recommendations. He went through several items he liked and when he recommended the Bacon Cheese Burger. About the employees. While I was waiting on the burger I had a chance to watch how they treated their customers. All I can say is WOW. Everyone got the same great service I had received. The employees were very friendly and helpful to everyone. They get an A+ for customer service. My burger came out and it was very good. It was flavorful and just the right size. I especially liked the bun. Not sure what kind of bun it was but it really made the burger. Out of all the places I have eaten down town this is one of the places I am coming back to and trying something else off their menu. If you want good food and great customer service give them a try. You will like them. Now what am I going to try next. (I will probably just ask for another recommendation). Oh Oh. The price for a burger and a drink no fries?? $7.00 plus some change. Great value!!

I had a salad. Not really a way to rate a Mexican Food restaurant. So why the 4 stars?  This is the second time I have been here the last time was several years ago when we were in the area. I live in Peoria and do not get in this part of town often.  If I lived in the area I would come here more often.  This is one of the places that is small and cozy and comfortable. You feel at home. The servers and manager made sure we were well taken care of.  I will make it a priority if I am in the area to stop by.

On our way to see the Luminaries at the Botanical gardens.  We were with friends that had eaten at this place before and they knew some of the history.  We were there early so getting a seat was easy.  Our friend told us the flooring, tables, windows and decorations came from a bar in Ireland. Knowing this made the experience more enjoyable.  We had a good meal with everyone enjoying their meal and eating more than we should. Prices were reasonable and the quantity of food was sufficient.  This would be a place to take pictures when the sun is shining through the stain glass windows,  I would definitely go back to eat there if I am in the area.

My wife and I have been going here for a couple of years. It is always a pleasant outing. The food is always good and the service is great. We almost always get one of their sandwiches which comes with chips and a pickle. Their tomato soup is maybe the best I have ever had. Only had it once as it is available on certain days. If you luck out when it is on the menu by all means get a bowl. Highly recommended.

Have eaten here several times over the years. It is a place I will eat at if I am in the mood for a hotdog and in the area. I would not drive across town.  Decorated with sports memorabilia. Mostly the Bears. Maybe only the Bears.  They serve a hot dog much like everyone else. Come on. If you use the same hotdog to start with how much different will it taste over everyone else's. Well it does. What i like best is when you bite into their hotdog there is a little snap as your teeth cut through the dog. As long as they are around I will continue to eat there when I am close. The service is always good and friendly.

Just what the community needs. A place close by to get fresh vegetables in the summer and a place that is transformed in the fall for Halloween. A place to take the little ones to see the farm animals. We enjoyed taking our grandchildren and our grandchildren enjoyed the animals and rides.

Coffee Shop in front, Christian book store in back. Lots of seating and there was people playing board games and just sitting around and talking. Very relaxed atmosphere. Well lit. Friendly staff.  I had expresso this is my drink of choice. Two shots with one inch of foam. The foam is a buffer for the expresso. It it is very good expresso you don't need the foam. Their express is good and I may try it without the foam next visit. It may be good enough to drink with out the foam. Left a very nice bitter fast in my mouth which I like. This bitter taste lasted for 15 to 20 minuets which to me is what I enjoy. Before I left I had a cup of coffee. Their coffee is much better that the other(popular) coffee shop.  If you want to sit down with friends or just alone and have a cup of coffee, better yet an expresso this is a very nice place.  They do have a punch card and you get a free drink with #10.  Enjoy

I have been doing business with this store since it was built I had a similar problem with then about 6 years ago. Had a battery go dead. Took the alternator in and had it tested. It tested good. They do not have equipment to do a proper test. Just checks voltage not amperage. Last time I told them to just give me an alternator after the battery died for the second time. This time I had an alternator quit and removed. They just sold me a rebuilt one for $150.00. Took it home installed. Did not charge. Took it back they tested said nothing wrong with alternator. Again just looked at voltage not the ability of the alternator charge at an amp output that would charge a battery. Took it back home installed it still did not change. Took the alternator off my PU and installed it on the Van. It charged fine. Put that one on the PU. It did not charge. Pep Boys refuses to help me with the matter. When I go in they all run and want me to wait for an hour till someone is free, by magic becomes free to help me. Oh and there is no one else in the store except me. They are to busy to help me. I don't know what they are so busy doing if they can't help a customer. I did after two trips to the store get my money back. I will not ever go back to buy parts. I gave them one star as you can't give 0.

I go to this Taco Bell when I am wanting something not to filling and inexpensive. I also go to this Taco Bell because of the people that work there. Several times they have suggested I order a special item that gave me more for less money. How many times do you get someone that is looking our for how much you spend today. I have eaten at different Taco Bells for years but this is the only place I have ever gotten the great customer service they offer.

I have been going to Brothers for almost 5 years now.   Usually on Sunday holidays. Or when we are going to do something and do not want to prepare food at home. Probably about 8 to 10 times a year.   Breakfast is the only meal I have eaten. Breakfast is not hard to prepare. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles are not hard to fix. Why is this the only place I eat breakfast when I am in Peoria? "Service" When you get there you are greeted with a smile. Everyone acts like they are genuinely glad you are there. They are ready to do what it takes to keep their customers happy. Your coffee cup is kept full. If your waiter or waitress is not there to fill your cup someone else passing by with coffee is. You can get bacon, eggs, two pieces of toast, and hash browns for $2.99. Why would anyone in the area go anywhere else? Everything always comes out tasting good,

First I like Sushi. I eat sushi every couple of months or so. I know nothing about how it is supposed to be prepared and presented. What I am trying to say is I am no expert on the subject. I just know what tastes good to me.  I was by myself and wanted sushi. My daughter was free and we met at Sushi Yuki on Thunderbird. We were early for the dinner crowd so we had the place much to ourselves. We ordered. I, really not knowing exactly what I was ordering except it sounded good. We had a cucumber salad, Spider roll, cucumber roll, California roll, scallop hand roll. Way more that anyone should eat. Everything was very good. I enjoyed the meal and the company of my daughter.  Our waitress was very attentive making sure our glasses were full and everything was to our liking. I will definitely go back. The plus is they are only 2 miles from where I live.

I have been here several times over the years but not as often as I probably should. The good thing is they are in walking distance but I always drive.  Family owned and ran always clean. Decorated as many of the neighbor hood pizza places. Their wings are nice and crisp the way I like them. There is a limited selection of sauce. Pretty much mild and spicy. Their pizza curst, the thin crust is excellent. Just the way i like and I like the plain cheese pizza best.  Everyone is always helpful, friendly, and lots of smiles. They ways point us to the specials, which are a good bargain.  This is another place when you are in the area or live in the area to give a try.

This is the fourth time I have been at this location, but it had been several years. From the outside it does not look to be very large, but when you get inside the place has many rooms to sit. On this occasion we were fortunate to have a window that looked out to the rabbit pen. Made the wait easy. We enjoyed watching the rabbits hopping around.  The restaurant was clean and everyone treated us like they wanted us to enjoy ourself and the meal. I got the rib tips and they were good. My two sides was A salad and a salad. Our food was delivered in a good amount of time. Only down side was I like Balsamic vinegar on my salad and they did not have.

I have been coming to this Starbucks for over 4 years. It is a morning routine.  I have a little poodle that is blind. She follows me around the house till we go for coffee. She gets 1/5 of a pumpkin loaf cake.  This store has the nicest people. Our mode of transportation is golf cart or 1929 Chevy 2 door sedan.  I go to several different Starbucks. This store always treats us very well.

Anytime I go to Vegas we always stop in at this outlet. I have a hard time finding shoes that fit as I have an exceptionally wide foot. Sketchers has a good selection of wide shoes in the style I like. Usually buy two pairs when we go. The people are helpful and if they don't have the shoes in stock they will take an order and sent them to your home. Never any push to buy, and helpful if you are trying to find something special.  I probably have 6 pair of Sketchers most in one style. Some for dirty work outside and some nice clean ones I use when I go shopping or out to eat.  OH! Sketchers is the only sports shoe I will buy. Theirs fit as I can get wide. Others brands have to be atlas one  to 1 1/2 sizes larger to accommodate my wide foot and they still are uncomfortable to walk long distance in.  So Buy Sketchers. They fit!

Have been to Ethel M a couple of times over the years.  It is always a treat to come here and watch them make candy.  The candy is some of the best you will ever eat. The bad is it is expensive. Another good is you  can buy a piece of candy and coffee and go out side to sit in the sun and enjoy the warm fall morning. That is what I did. We did buy a pound for a friend but just a couple of pieces for ourselves. If you want M&M they have many colors to choose from.  Interesting place to visit.

We used to go quite often to Famous Dave's with the family. Everyone enjoyed the meals. We had not been for a couple of years. Maybe we just got burned out on BQ.  It was early and my wife and I were looking for a place to eat. We were passing by Dave's and decided we needed to stop for BQ.  IF you have not been to Dave's the place is decorated with old antiques and posters, signs pictures of BQ places around the US. There is outside seating and this is a great option this time of year. The staff is always or has always been very friendly and accommodating.   What a great choice. The secret is getting there before and ordering before 4:30. I got the rib tips and brisket. My wife just got the pulled pork. There was enough food on my plate for three people. (if you had already feasted on the seasoned homemade potato chips). The total for both our meals was under $18.00 and both of us took home enough food for a meal. I ate mine for lunch for the next two days. Put in on a tortilla with some cheese, one min, in the microwave and lunch.  Now if I could just get the rest of the family to eat early. Some times being retired has it perks.  Enjoy good food. Go see Dave.

My wife and I have been eating at Tagliani's for many years. We have a frequent dinners card with them that awards us points.  That aside.  We never get anything fancy. Usually just their pasta bowel. You get a choice of about 10 pastas, 10 sauces, 25 added toppings. (Meat, Veg, cheese). Always get the half size. This is always more than enough and I always take half home.  The food has always been good and the service has always been good. Not great that is the reason for the 4 stars. They do serve good food and in a quantity that is for me to much to eat at one setting at a reasonable price. The decor, and music fits the Italian style. They always play Frank Sinatra songs. The seating is comfortable and you can carry on a conservation with who you are with without having to shout and now everyone knows what you are talking about. There is a lot to choose from on the menu. The only thing I wish they had would be a pasta dish with fish, shrimp, octopus, clams, mussels. I can keep wishing and hope they see this and grant my wish to me.   I will keep coming back. Give them a try.  Enjoy life!! Craig

Me? Eat at a franchised burger joint?  Not many Whataburger left in Phoenix.  Out of all the franchised places this is the one I enjoy. Everyone is always nice. I am not speaking of just this one but all I have eaten at. I ate at them years ago in Phoenix. Then I started working in El Paso Texas. They are many there and I liked their burger. Maybe because they don't put a special sauce on it. They come with mustard just the way I would fix it if I was at home. Nice large tomato and lettuce.  The personal touch is they deliver it to your table along with any condiment you may want.  Always a smile when you order and when it is delivered to your table. OH! And most times when I leave I get an invite back and have a good day.  Whataburger wants your business and acts like it.  Give them a try.

Out shopping with my wife and it was lunch time. I have never been to On the Border so we stepped in and waited. There was many tables open but no one to set you. Finally someone came and seated us. Our waitress came soon after and we ordered. We had to wait to get our tea refilled. Service was slow and, (I just did not feel welcome).  I got a burrito I think my wife got the same.  The food was ok. Eatable. By no means great. In this area there are several very good Mexican Food restaurants. For this reason I have no reason to return to this one. I don't want to sound mean. The food was eatable ok food when you can get great food for the same price and the waitress acts like they are glad you are there.  CHOW (purina)

Always looking for a different place to eat. Bookmarked this place several months ago and it was lunch time with no plans.  Short drive from home. We got there around 1:00 and the place was almost empty.  I believe this would be a good place to bring a group of people. Everyone should be able to find something they liked.  Met at the front by a extremely friendly person. We were seated and our waitress came by and took our order. I got the California burger without a bun. Some places have trouble making a burger without a bun and making it look like it is still a full meal. They did a very good job doing this for me. My meal was good. The attention they play to their guest is excellent. I will definitely be back.

Quiessence at the Farm My wife and I share the same birthday, which is good for me, as I don't have to try to remember when it is. I have done a tasting or sampling menu before and wanted to do this again for my wife's birthday.  What a nice place to eat. I made a call in the morning to check on the reservation and dress code in any. Dress code basically is business casual. Nice pair of pants and sports shirt and you are fine. I told them it was our birthday and we wanted a quite place to sit and talk. The person on the phone suggested the patio. This would be outside and since the reservation was for 6:00pm and it has been a warm week in Phoenix, I felt it would be fine, and it was a great choice. Hope you noticed I patted my self on the back. I will need that soon.  We were met by our waiter James and shown to our table. We were at least 12 feet from the next occupied table. They may of heard us talking but I never knew they were there.  James was an excellent waiter. Enough contact but did not over do it as it happens at times. The servers that brought the food made the experience special. They told us what we were getting, how it was prepared and suggestions on how it might be enjoyed. I wish I knew their names, they are to be commended. Both of enjoyed our 2 hour meal, with plenty of time to talk between courses.  I will definitely be back to see them.  Now I need to rate myself. I have to give myself 2 stars. One reason I chose this restaurant was because they had a tasting menu and wanted my wife to have this experience. I am AADD and when I get something in my mind I just forge ahead blindly. My mistake was I had not read the tasting menu. If I had I would of noticed the raw fish and oysters. I am fine with raw fish and oysters but my wife is not. This meant there was one course she did not get to participate. It was her birthday also. She was so good about this and did not say anything except enjoy these are yours. We did have a delightful night eating and talking. Something I would enjoy again.....but first I would read the menu! There was 6 full courses to the meal with of a total of 19 different items to taste. I many of missed counting an item or two. With the exception of the amuse-bouche there was plenty of each item for both of us to have a good taste.  We had a wonderful night and I do not hesitate to recommend Quiessence.

This was not our first trip to this resturant. They always have some kind of promotional going on which usually keeps the resturant full. Tonight when we arrived we were seated quickly. There were several large groups waiting. The resturant is made up of many rooms all decorated with a mexican theme. We were waited on by Matt. He was attentive and took very good care of us. As with most Mexican Food resturants you start out with chips and salsa. Their salsa is a little more spicy than most. I like it hot so this is fine with myself. They also offer a hotter version.  I had their Chili Verde. I have eaten it several times before and it is one of my favorites.  It comes with rice and beans. There is very good quanity as well as quality. You will not go away hungry. Our dinning experience was pleasent and we went away full. I would definitely recomment Valley Luna.

Everyone has their own rating scale. Mine has been what ever I thought at the moment. I need to change and be more consistent in my ratings. One, two and three stars do not need much explanation it will be evident in the review. Four stars is we had a good meal and I will consider eating there when I am in the area. Five stars? I am planning on going back as soon. I will make a special trip to go eat there. Even if I have to drive 20 or 30 miles to do it.  We had just got our taxes done. It was ab out 9:00am and we wanted breakfast. I did go to Yelp to find a place in the area and this place had some pretty good reviews. If you blink you will miss the building. I had to turn around and come back as I did miss it. Parking in front is limited. I do not know what is is back or street.  The theme is music. There are many pictures of music and musical instruments around the room. The room is laid out simple tables and booths. There were quite a few people eating there but the noise was quite. Everything looked clean and orderly. The food was good, but breakfast is hard to mess up. I had two eggs, bacon, sliced tomato instead of hash browns, and coffee. It was good. The beacon was nice thick slices, not the skinny stuff you get some places.  One of the big reasons for the 4 stars was the people that worked there. Everyone was very helpful and willing to substitute items on a listed menu meal. Some places are not or want to charge extra. Her attitude was whatever made you happy makes us happy. If I am in the area I will eat there again.

This restaurant has been here for quite a while. I live 1 1/2 mile away but had never eaten here.  Walk in, walk up to the order counter, order, find a table.  Not a large place and most of the people seemed to be regulars. I know I will be back. Simple setup. I believe 3 TVs with sport. So if you want a pizza and watch the game, this would be a good choice.  There is 8 or so pizza places in the area. I have eaten at most over the years. This place had more people eating there than I believe any others.  We got their hot wings and a fully loaded 14 inch pizza thin crust. Loved the crust and there was plenty of toppings. The hot wings were hot and I found then to be just right for my liking. Drinks are self serve, so no waiting for someone to come buy to refill. The people were nice, helpful and attentive. Eat local. Give them a try.

First I am not a sushi expert. I do know when I like something. I have been trying places close to where I live. There are many places close to me in Peoria. Until you start looking you don't realize just how many places there are. This is one place I had not been. So far this is the best place I have tried. Remember this was just the first visit so until I get in several visits and try more of the menu will I really know how much I like them. The star rating could go up or down. The service was great. The meal was about $2.00 more than I have been paying for something similar. It was better tasting. Fresh distinct tastes. I am looking forward to a repeat visit.

Some people think all coffee is the same. If you are just going in for a cup of coffee there are a lot of places that make a good cup of coffee. If it was just the coffee most would go out of business. Few people get just a cup of coffee. Most go in for the expensive exotic coffee drinks. Not me. I go for the expresso. Two shots of expresso with an inch of foam. My special drink. The little foam takes the edge off the expresso. If it is really good expresso you don't need the foam.  Their expresso is good. I have not tried it without foam. Next time. Service seems to be very friendly and helpful even when we come in as they are getting ready to close. I don't usually order as my daughter orders for me and usually buys my drink when I am there. (Lucky Me)(Sweet Daughter) Another reason people to the the coffee shop is to meet with friends or just be alone and work on their computers, read even have seen people sleeping. It's A Grind is a great place to do this. Room inside and out side to set and talk.  Nice people good coffee. Go see them it is worth the visit.

This is one of the stores that is worth a visit. It is like stepping into another world. Even if you don't buy anything. I always do! They have the best fresh produce displays of anywhere in Phoenix. The cakes in the bakery are decorated beautifully. We bought two and thought it can't taste as good as it looks. They did. Very good tasting. Beside the produce displays the quality is very good. Everything looks and is fresh.  The meat department has everything form standard cuts of meat, fish, to a cow head.  We always eat when we go to shop. Their food is priced low and you get plenty to eat. They have a big selection of fresh food. All being cooked and prepared as you watch.  This is a place to go see even if you are not in the area. Take some time. Visit the store. Have a great lunch. Look around. I think you will find many things you will want to take home with you.  Craig

I went to Casa Filipina Bakeshop & Restaurant. I am no expert on Filipino food. I have only been to one in CA twice. I  want to find a place in Phoenix. Surprise there is one 7 miles from where I live.  They are located in a strip mall. You may miss them unless you was looking. Very simple lay out. Has a home feeling. Nothing fancy. Clean. As you enter you pass a glass case with very good looking pastries. An extremely nice young man showed me to a table. It was about 4:30pm so I was the only person in the restaurant. He asked if I had eaten Filipino food before. I told him only twice before and I would need help. He suggested the beef steak. Prepared in a sauce with onion and potatoes. No processed taste, genuine home cooked meal.  Very taste. There was a salad of fine noodles. I did enjoy everything I had a dessert of Ube and a cup of coffee. When i left everyone invited me back. It was only about 5:15pm by now and they were setting up for a band that plays there on Fridays. I have been to a lot of places to eat. The people here made me feel at home and welcome. I am going back. Probably tomorrow for lunch or dinner. I gave them 4 stars. I will probably change this to a 5 next review.

I am not a fan of buffets. Not because of bad food. Because there is to much there to eat and I eat more than I need.  It was my Mother In Laws birthday. This is one of their favorite places to eat. We are all seniors and the food is very affordable and the food is good. Oh and you can stuff yourself so you are sure to get your moneys worth!!  This time we had a lady that took care of our table. Her name was Linda.  WoW!! The best service I have had anywhere. She was great. Always there to remove plates and fill your glass and coffee after the meal. I do hope you have the pleasure of having her for your table waiter when you eat there.  I started to watch her. She was moving faster than anyone else by at least two times. Never a waisted moment. She was giving every table she took care of the same attention she did us.  Because of this service I went to talk with the manager as we left to let him know what a star he had in Linda. I also wrote a letter to their corporate to let them know.   We often easily write about good service and bad service.   When we get bad service? Some of us will tell the management. Some of us will just not return. I may do both or neither.   I do tell the management and write letters when I get great service.   Remember Enjoy

Lenny's is one of my burger favorites. They always have a nice juicy burger fixed the way you want. This Lenny's is decorated with old signs and the seating is, well lets say tight. I think there is 5 booths and a long narrow table in the center. They have many choices other than burgers and everything I or the people with me have gotten has been very good. I have been to several other Lenny's. Lenny's menu may change from one store to the next but all I have eaten at has been good.

Ollie's is a locally owned restaurant. Neighborhood restaurant comfortable, a place to have a nice meal and relax. For this reason alone is a reason to return. I do have a return visit planned. I went for breakfast. They do serve lunch and dinner. Menu is burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish.  Breakfast was good and they were very willing to tailor the meal to my wishes. Beacon and eggs are hard to mess up and not the best way to judge a restaurant. My meal was good. The service was excellent. My wife got a short stack of pancakes and it was served with hot syrup, just how she likes it.  Oh. I really did like the coffee. Better than most places.  I do plan on going back for breakfast, I will probably not do lunch, but I will probably do a dinner there soon.

I apologize for not writing this one soon after I ate there. We had read the reviews and everyone seemed to really like the food. This place is not fancy by any means. Very plain but the food.... The offerings on the menu was different from any mexican food place I have been to. Many offerings I have never seen before. My suggestion is go there and experience the food. I have eaten mexican food all over the west from Texas to California and all states between. This was  the best I have had. I loved the menu selections. Not just burritos, tacos, tostadas or a combination of these three. A completely new offerings of items and everything looked good. First go to their website then go. It was hard for me to rate this restaurant. The food was positively a 5. The service was a 4. Not bad service, just not as good as it gets. The store was a 4. Nothing bad just not a 5. So I gave the place a 4. If I could give a 4.5.   Go there. Eat! Enjoy. I loved the new food choices. Definitely going back.

We had gotten a gift card for the FOX restaurants. We had about 6 restaurants from which to choose. I decided on the North - Glendale. We made reservations for 6:45 and arrived about 10 min early. They were not busy yet and we were seated at that time. Our waiter was Matthew a very energetic and helpful person. He told us about the special and answered the questions we had for entrées we were considering. My wife decided on the Margherita Pizza and me on the Ahi Tuna. Their pizza is on a very thin crust which is how we prefer it. The Ahi was ordered rare. When our order arrived the waiter said he thought the Ahi may be a little more cooked than I had ordered and offered to take it back if I wanted one less cooked. It was cooked more than I would have liked but I told him it was fine. It was a very nice piece of meat. We had great service. Matthew was very attentive but not overly attentive. All our needs were met and we will definitely go back. The staff is a great group of people. Oh the pizza was very good and more than most would eat at one setting.

I needed to celebrate today, at lunch I was wanting sushi. I looked through the restaurant list in Yelp and saw that Lee Lee Market had sushi and the reviews were good. The amazing thing is they are less than half a mile form my house. They have been there for two years and I just have never been in the market. I do know I will be back many times. I am not a sushi expert but I know when I like what is in my mouth. I got a 6 piece combination plate. Has shrimp, eel, 2 pieces of tuna, 2 pieces of salmon. I did go a little over board and also ordered the Lee Lee roll. To top everything off I had a Thai tea with boba (tapioca).  Once you go into the market the first thing you will notice is the fish smell. They sell fresh fish and I do not mind the smell. Very soon you don't smell it at all. You will see a restaurant and next a sandwich stand. I went to the sandwich stand and ordered the sushi form a very nice person. He was very helpful in ordering the sushi since I do not know much about it. I forgot to oder a drink and decided on the thai tea. I was asked do I want boba in the tea. I did not know since I had never tasted boba. He gave me a sample and I was hooked. The Thai Tea I have had before was layered and you had to mix it up. I kinda like this. Here it is mixed up with you get it with the boba in the bottom. You get a big straw and get a couple of  balls each time you get a drink. I have to do this again. The first course was the 6 piece combination. Everything was very fresh and tasty. The tuna and salmon was melt in your mouth. You did not have to chew it. The next course was the Lee Lee roll. Two items are more than one person should eat. I was full about to pop when I left. Anyway the Lee Lee roll was good. Not sure just what was in it. I know there was avocado with some kind of paste tasted like salmon or tuna with eel and avocado around the outside. I enjoyed my meal. I will be back many times. Not just for the sushi but also to shop. There is a lot of very interesting food to buy. This is a very popular place. Their parking lot is jammed.

What can you say about a movie theater??  I prefer Harkins. Their popcorn is better that the rest and they have toppings to put on their popcorn.  The theater is always clean and everyone greets you with hi, hope you enjoyed the show.

We come to Basha's mainly for their meat and specials. They are a little higher than most of the other local stores. We have always got great tasting meat and their produce is better than most of the stores in this area.  You are always treated with smiles and what can I do for you. The stores are always clean and orderly. We have several stores in the area that specialize in produce (vegetables). Basha's beats them hands down.

I first ate at In & Out when I was in Las Vegas several years ago. Then a few years ago they moved to Arizona and at a location not far from where I live in Peoria. The attraction for me was the ability to get a burger wrapped in lettuce. (Protein Style) If you know the key words you can get your burger cooked many ways that are not published on the menu. I could never quite understand the crowd of people coming there to eat. Lined up out the door and a line of cars around the place with someone out side taking orders. It is just a hamburger nothing exceptional. They do have good fries. Better than most.  Today I had spent 3 hours installing cabinet doors at my in-laws house. Was not supposed to take this much time but it seems to go that way at times. Well I worked way past lunch and was hungry. In & Out was on the way home. Really should of driven a couple of miles out of the way and gone to Rocket Burger.  Any way I got what I always get a single cheese burger protein style a order of fries and a ice tea. Now I don't eat there very often but when I took my first bite and looked at the burger I noticed it was only about 3/16 of an inch thick. It could of even been thinner. I went WOW where is the beef.(Sorry for using an over used term.) This was quite a bit thinner than I can rememberer. I know, I know, I know, if they had been that thin in the past I surely would of noticed. It was just a little thicker than peanut butter spread on a piece of toast. Guess I can blame it on the economy. Rocket Burger is at least 2 to 3 times thicker. Much better value.  If you go to In & Out, look at the patty.   This review is meant to inform. Not to be negative. Hopefully you do not take it as being negative.  In & Out is always clean, the people friendly and cheerful, the food was good tasting.  The reason for the 2 stars and not 3 was value. The people at the restaurant did everything right.  Happy eating!

My wife and children often to to Jason's to eat. We like it because after we finish we feel welcome to just sit there for a hour and talk. This night it was just my wife and I along with a take out for my son and his wife.  This was our first time or at least for me to visit this location. We usually go to the Arrowhead location.  When we got there the place was very cold. a couple of tables of people had their hoodies up because of the cold. I believe it was almost colder inside than out side. The air conditioner was on because you could feel the cold air coming from the vents on your head. It was not that they did not know it was cold as everyone that came in reminded them how cold it was inside. We would of left if it had not been for the order for my son and his wife. We figured we could leave our coats on and eat quickly and leave. Which is what we did.  My wife got the chicken pot pie soup. She usually gets this at the other Jason's. It came to the table to cold to eat. It was sent back to be heated. My sandwich was good.   I will be back to Jason's just not this one.

Lunch time and Gyros Place was across the road. Decided to give it a try. Place seemed to be clean decor was some paintings of the New York skyline. Pretty much like most of the strip mall food places. I got their special which was a chicken pita with fries and a drink. Meal was priced right. The fries was hot and taste. The pita was good. There was nothing wrong with the food it just was not anything to write home about. Would I eat there again. The answer is: If I happen to be in the area at lunch time, hungry, I might eat there again. Would just depend on what I was wanting. There was nothing exceptional about them. The food was OK the service was OK. Nothing special.

It was dinner time and we decided to go to BJ's. I knew since it was 7:00 there would be a wait. We were told it would be 45min. This was fine with us. We were seated in about 30 min. The layout of the restaurant is open but the noise level was not bad. You can easily carry on a conservation at your table. We were seated by a very energetic hostess. I did not get her name but she made you feel like they were glad to see you and service was going to be great. Our waiter was Gabby. She took our drink orders quickly and brought our drinks. I finished my ice tea before our meal was delivered. It was several minuets till this was noticed and was offered a refill. Everyone ordered and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I had ordered the half soup and salad. Not anything complicated. Wedge salad and clam chowder in a sour bread bowel. Others ordered BBQ chicken chopped salad, Angel Hair Toscana, and a Traditional Calzone.  All the food did not arrive at the same time and we had to ask to get the remainder delivered. My clam chowder was very bland and did not have much taste. There was plenty of clam meat but it was hard to tell it was clam chowder by the taste. Definite don't go for the clam chowder. I asked about the calzone and was told it had almost no filling. Very little cheese and was mostly pizza dough. So don't go for the calzone. The others reported their chicken salad and angle hair pasta was very good. We had to wait again for some time to get refills on drinks. Our waiter was not very attentive. Will I go back? I will probably give them another chance. I do know what I will not order next time. I do like the look and feel of the restaurant.

First Alicia gets 4 stars. She did a great job.  Do not like how they drop.Felt like I was in a cocoon. I was hot all the time. The massage oil is heavy and I was slick. Should have a wet towel wipe down after the massage. I had to have a shower when I got home. I had a gift card that was bought some time ago when their massage was $40.00 instead of $50.00. I had called in earlier and explained and was told if it says a hour massage it is an hour massage, it is not a chase value it is for a massage. When I got through they informed me I needed to pay an extra $10.00. They knew this going in but waited till the massage3 was over. No way to do business. I will not b3 going back even with a gift card.

Just got back form Ronnie's Cafe.  Very interesting place. I drive by there several times a week but did not know they were there. Was looking for a new breakfast spot to try this morning and they were close. This was Saturday morning and the place was pretty busy. We was seated within 5 min. of arriving.  The decor is what I wold call unique. Very unique. Almost like waking into a boutique. Many pictures, plates, cups, magnets. Lots of stuff for sale. Or at least there was price tags on the items. Some of the carpentry work looked almost temporary. Nailed in place but never quite finished. Plenty of light and not so loud where you and the person you was with could not talk easily.  The service. We were treated as valued guests. There were several times to fill the coffee cups and to check if you needed anything else.  The meals. This was breakfast. I got their two eggs, potatoes, toast. Not a complicated meal and it was very good. Way more potatoes than I could eat. I got rye toast and it was better than most places I get rye toast at. My wife got the cinnamon french toast. They make the cinnamon bread there and my wife said it was good. They could have a broader selection of syrup.  Conclusion?? Good place eat breakfast. Food is reasonable priced and good. Service we received was very good. Have a nice day Enjoy

We are in this area quite often and it was lunch time. We was a little early for the lunch crowd and was seated quickly. The decor is pleasing not  dressy. There are wine lockers when you come in with dinners names on them. We was seated by a window that opened to a courtyard. There were birds bathing in a bath. We enjoyed watching them come and go. We both ordered salads. I got the Satsay Salad and a Thai tea. The salad was excellent. I would definitely recommend. I am not a big eater and this salad easily made a full meat for me. I will definitely come back and try some of their other food. While the staff was friendly and the servfice was good, they were a little stuffy.

Business Costco. Like coming here to get the things you can't get at the regular Costco. Lots if business items for restaurants and retail.  We don't have a restaurant or retail but we do feed 20+ people at our home 4 times a year.  Plates, glasses, servers, large coolers, large freezer section with cheeses, dairy and meats. Too many items to remember. You need to go there to experience. If you have a restaurant or retail business I am sure you already know about this place. If you occasionally entertain and need equipment of product this is the place to to.

Usually don't give 5 start on first visit. I am because I am already planning another visit.  I have wanted to dine at this restaurant for sometime, I am in Peoria and they are in Scottsdale. My daughter gave us a gift card for Christmas, no more excuses. There was a party of 7. On arrival for a 5:30 reservation we were promptly seated. Our waiter Derek went over the set up for the ones that had not eaten at a Fogo before. Through our stay Dered made sure we were well taken care of thought out the meal. I would definitely give Derek a thumbs ups.  About the food. You can start with the salad bar which is stocked with all the salad makings plus cheeses and bacon. Not the crumbled kind that nay or may not of been bacon but actual strips of bacon, crush it up for your salad or just eat the strip along with the salad.  Me I am on a protein diet and I waited at the table with the green side of my chip up. You get a chip with a green side which says I am ready for meat or a red side when you are resting between pieces of meat. The meat was excellent, every piece was well prepared. There was also at least 4 types of breads, fried bananas and mashed potatoes served with the meal.  I will be back.  Oh, and Thanks Derek for watching over us.

Date 12-4-1010   In the past year I have eaten in your Peoria store not less than 30 times. We use this place to meet with our friends and children. We can come in get something to eat and chat.   Tonight my wife and I went there to eat. She ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and I ordered the same in a bread bowl. The bread bowls just have a small divot in the top for the soup. This divot is much to small for a cup of soup and it spills into the plate. I asked if enough bread could be removes to hold the soup without it spilling onto the plate. Nothing was said. When my order was delivered to the table the person proceeded to tell me that if I wanted it that way in the future they would have to charge me for a bowl of soup instead of a cup.   I never asked for any special consideration on the price when I ordered the soup. Would not that of not been the time to tell me that it would cost more to fix the soup the way I wanted ?? The person that delivered the soup then proceeded to lecture me on the fact that I had gotten more than I had paid for. I asked her to please leave. I had to do this twice as she continued to try and lecture.   I did not get her name. She was about 5'8" slim light brown hair. Probably 20 or less. I should of called for the manager but at that time I was so mad I just ate my soup and left.   I have been eating out for many years. This is the worst service I have ever had. Maybe you think one out of 30 times in the restaurant is acceptable for bad service. I don't!!  I did write a letter to the Corporate Office.  Lets see if they care?

We go to Blu Burger because it is close to us and close to my daughters house. Nice place to meet, talk and have a nice meal. There is out sitting that is dog friendly and my daughter and son will occasionally bring their pets.  Their food is good but what I like is you can get your burger the way you want it. I know you can other places but here that is their specialty. Burgers made to order. They can get crowded at times but most times the wait is not long.  One drawback is parking. Parking is never hard to find but most times it will involve a walk.

I am on jury duty twice a week for 4 months. ( I am retired and it gives me a chance to see a part of Phoenix I have not had reason to visit. Each day I have eaten at a different place.  Cartel Coffee Lab is more than coffee. They also serve breakfast and lunch. Not sure about dinner.  I would call the decor and lay out as trendy but I really don't pay much attention to decor.  I decided on the BLT. On ordering it I was informed that there was an egg on the BLT and was that OK. I spent several weeks in Canada and there is a chain of restaurants by the name of Tim Horton that serve a BELT. (Beacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato.) So My answer was definitely that is OK. The sandwich I had was very good. The lady that waited on me was extremely nice. After finishing my sandwich she came over and asked me how I liked it and spent some time just talking to me. Great Customer Service. Why not 5 stars? I usually have to eat a couple of times to give out a 5. If get to eat there again and get the same great service and food I will revise my score to a 5.  If you are down town. Go see them I know you will be happy with their food and service.  I will try their expresso next trip and I feel it will be good also.

Said I was going to try their coffee or expresso. Gave them a try this morning. Ordered two shots of expresso with an inch of foam. They made jokes about the amount of foam which I found very tasteless, arrogant and rude. The drink I order came and it was not what I had ordered. Again time to listen to a very rude person. Two shots of expresso and an inch of foam should be about two inches in the cup they use. There was less than in inch. I questioned them about it and received some mumbo jumbo about the foam being in the expresso. I believe what he was trying to say was I know more about expresso than you and I know how not you what you want. Really turned me off. I do not profess to be an expert on expresso. I have been drinking it for the past 30 years all way from Italy, Greece, and across America. I am not an expert but I do know what I want. And it is not someone rude arrogant person. The taste of their expresso was just slightly better than one of the well known chains. Customer service I would rate at a D-.  At a D- you don't get a return visit.

My wife and I have been there 4 times for lunch. There is almost never anyone in the restaurant at lunch time. Not enough going on at West-Gate to bring people into the area for lunch unless you work close. I always get a Village salad. I don't know anything about their other foods. Why a village salad. I was in Athens for 4 days and every day I got what they called a Greek salad. Their Greek salad did not have lettuce  in it. When you order a greek salad you get lettuce in it. Their Village Salad is what I was getting in Athens. Confused now??? Well that is why I go there. I can get a salad I call a Greek salad just by a different name. If you like Feta cheese, Cucumber, Greek Olives, Tomato, Onion, touch of olive oil and basaltic vinegar. You will like their Village Salad.   Decoration is appropriate for the food they are serving. Everyone has always been friendly and helpful. The place has always been very clean.   I don't know anything about the rest of their food. I go there for the Village Salad and I like it.

Love the layout of the business. Lots of seating out side and also seating inside. Only been here twice. I would go lots more if I did not live in Peoria. They are extremely friendly and helpful when you are ordering. I have had their tacos, burrito and last time the vegetarian Quesadilla. I have found their food very fresh and tasty. I will definitely go back to see them when I am in the area. Go see them I am sure you will enjoy your meal.

Open 24 hours. My wife and I have always got good food, and service here. Herrera's is less than 1/4 mile from our house.  They have a few tables in the restaurant but most of their business it drive through and take out.  Their burritos are plenty for one person to eat if you are hungry and enough to share if you are not.  I enjoy coming here because the food is good, people friendly and this is a locally owned business which I prefer. Give them a try! You will be back.

Had been on a three week car or truck trip across the US. Plenty of dirt and before I left I had used some Barrett Jackson spray wax on the truck and it had turned all my black plastic white which the manufacture said would not happen. So learned a lesson there, don't buy that product again. Went in and the sales pitch started, which I hate. Wanted to do a express wax which they said would take care of the white on the back plastic. Which i did opt to do. Also told me the spray wax would etch the plastic. Please don't lie to me to get me to buy into a wax job. Then tried to sell me a chip repair which there were only specks in the windshield no crack or chips. I used to do this type of work where I worked as we had 300+ units and it was cheaper for us to do the work as to hire it out.  All in all my truck was fairly clean. The windshield still had some bug goo on it in places and the white on the black plastic was mostly gone but they had missed some spots.  I will probably be back but just for a wash as it is reasonably priced. If you want to build loyal customers stop the sales pitch.

Who could say anything bad about some of the best chocolate in US. We have been going to one Sees candy or another for over 30 years. They have always treated me well. Their place is always very clean and neat. (I tried to use a fancy word for very clean but my spell check failed to understand what I wanted).  I know you are not supposed to feed a dog chocolate, but we had a dog about 15 years ago that would not eat anything but Sees. She would ignore any chocolate but Seas.  When we go back east we always take about 10 boxes of Seas to our relatives. They always look forward to the Seas.  Easy place to shop. You can get a box already made up and they have many different boxes to chose from or you can have them make a box up for you of all your favorites. So many choices.  Go see them. Usually they give you a piece of candy while you are in the store. If you are lucky you may get two.

Went to lunch with my son and his wife. There is a place near him called Rocket Burger.   Very unique place. They have a pretty good menu. I had the Bacon burger. My wife had had a veggie pizza bread, an open sandwich with cheese and vegetables grilled on top. My son had a burger with a deep fried pineapple ring. His wife I think had a burger. We got two orders of fries.   What I had was very good. Everyone seemed to like what they got. The portions are large. Meaning you get good value for your dollar. There is plenty of fires in two orders to feed 4 people. They have a pretty large and assorted menu. I will go back to try something different next time.   What makes them unique is they have a cooler with at least 200 different drinks. Everyone should be able to find something they like. The other was the adequate portions of food for a low price. Others could learn something from this.  The people are very friendly and anxious to make you happy. I will definitely go back to visit.   I would give them 4.5 stars but there is no way of doing that. Go See Them You Will Enjoy Your Visit.

Rocket Burger Again Why do I keep going back? Well they are not the run of the meal hamburger shop. They have a lot of other items on their menu. They don't just cook hamburgers they continually creating new tastes in hamburgers and other items on their menu. I like to go in often just to see what is new and how it tastes. I have had their AfterBurner Hamburger twice. What a treat!! We have been going there for several months now and have never gotten anything we did not like.  The nicest people you would ever want to meet. Always checking to see if everything is good. They always make everyone feel like they are one of their best customers.  I like their frys as you can eat them without having to put catsup on the. Most places you have to drowned them in catsup to eat them. Here taste just fine the way they are.  I am telling you these people are cooking geniuses.  If you have not visited you are missing out on the best burgers in Phoenix

I just keep going back!!! If you want the best burger, best service, nicest people. This is the place to go. Now I have not tried everything on the menu (Yet). But I am trying. We go there almost weekly to see what is new. I always ask Steve what I should try this trip. He never steers me wrong. Their burgers are not just burgers like you get in most places. They are what you would call a work of art the way they combine different tastes. You can go many places to get a hamburger but you will not find a better burger or sub anywhere. On top of this you will be greeted  by the nicest group of people in the valley.  THIS PLACE IS MY ATF (all time favorite). Keep it up Rocket Burger. Can't wait to see what is new.

I visit Rocket Burger several times a month. Not as often as I would like.  There are many reasons I go there. The food is good and the people that own the place and the workers are the best.  We go there to eat and visit. The nicest people you could ever meet. We try to go in the off hours so we have some time to talk with the owners and workers.  Go in and say Hi. Again the food is good and the people are the nicest you can find anywhere.

My son told me about Maui Dog. He is always trying new places.  I like the locally owned restaurants. The experience just seems more personal. There was 6 in our group and we tried a variety of items off the menu. I got the Island dog with tater tots. There was an order of the Spam sliders we shared.  The place is decorated island style. I have been to the Hawaii many times and when you go to the outer islands this is just what you might find. We were there on Saturday and after the lunch hour so the place only had a few people eating. This gave me the opportunity to talk to the owner. He is really a super nice person. He shared how he got the idea from some time spent in Hawaii.  The food. I have eaten at a several places around Phoenix that specialize in hot dogs. I am not going to mention names but they are all well reviewed places. Everything from a hot dog on a bun with fixings to a place that advertised Chicago style hot dogs. Maui Dog was by far better than the rest. It is not just a hot dog or a brat with some fixings. It is a combinations of tastes that make the experience. Who would of thought coconut, mango, pineapple would be good on a hot dog? Yes they are sweet. If you don't like sweet they can make your hot dog to order just ask. When you eat their hot dog or brat you don't just taste the hot dog or brat. The mixture of flavors when you bite into one of their hot dogs is what makes this place so unique.  I live in Peoria and it is a 45 min drive to eat at Maui Dog. I will be back to see if they taste as good the second time as the first.   The place was clean. The food was good. The service was good. The price for what you  got was good. The location? Need one closer to Peoria. I will be back.  If you just want a hot dog. Fix it at home. Yuck! If you like something different see them.

Today I chose Five Guys for lunch. I believe this place is a chain burger place like In-and Out. At least it has that feel when you enter the restaurant. My choose was a bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion,mustard. No fries as I don't need the calories. The burger comes with two pieces of meat. From all appearance it looked like a very good burger. To my surprise it had very little taste. All the makings was there but no taste.  But then I have been spoiled from eating at Rocket Burger.

I am there for the coffee, espresso. I have been there about 5 times now and will continue to visit a couple of times a week. Busy place in the mornings but does not take long to get your drink. Everyone has always been very nice to me and remembering what I want on the second visit was pretty good. There is also a plus. My drink two shots of espresso with one inch of heavy cream is $0.35 cents less than the other place. I will withhold the name as I am still upset with them for changing their loyal customer program to a reward program. (there is a difference) Go see them they have been treating me well.

Leaving the house this morning I noticed the Anise Cafe. They are only about a half mile form my house in a strip mall. I had never really noticed them. I had made up my mind I would give them a try at the first chance. It is now lunch time and I decided today is the day. I like to patronize locally owned establishments as more of the money I spend stays in my community.  I knew they were asian but not what to expect. I looked at Yelp when we got to our table and they are labeled as Asian Fusion. I am not an expert in any way on Asian food. I do know when I like how it tastes.  There is an order counter in front as you walk in and some tables and chairs to the left as you come in. Farther back is some booths. We sat in a booth. Everything was clean abd Our waitress came over promptly and asked what we wanted to drink. On bring our tea she asked if we had decided. I had decided on the beef Poe soup. My wife got shrimp laid out on sweet potatoes. Since I had not been there before and because I was not thinking I did not realize these dishes were made to share. There were only about 5 shrimp and this was a pretty light meal for my wife. On the other hand the Poe was in a very large bowel. I offered some Poe to my wife but she did not want any, leaving this large bowel to me. She said the shrimp and sweet potato was good. The Poe was excellent. Lot of meat and noodles.  I gave them 4 stars. I will definitely be coming back. There are several other dished that looked good.   Everything looked good and tasted good. The food was priced right. We were well taken care of. Our tea was filled three of four times.

Just had coffee (espresso). I have been there about 6 times now. Friendly, helpful staff. Their expresso is much better that most. I don't order by name as some places do similar drinks differently. I order by description. My drink is 2 shots of expresso in a tall cup not the short one. With one inch of foam. Call it what you want. I call it two shots of expresso in a tall cup with an inch of foam. If the espresso is good you don't need the foam. Theirs is good enough to drink with out the foam. I have found only 4 places that I can drink without the foam.   Give them a try if you are downtown. They will treat you right and you will get the drink you ordered.   ENJOY

I don't give out many 5's. Let me explain why they get a 5. They are better than any of the Chinese fast food places I have been. The food was plentiful, hot, and taste. The service was good. I just don't think it could get better.  I drive to Arrowhead area several times a week and have seen Yu's. They are new and have only been open a couple of weeks. Since they are in my neighborhood, I thought I should give them a try. Very clean and friendly place. We went in at lunch time and looked at the lunch menu. They have lunch meals for less than $6.00. With drink was just over $7.00 per meal. I got the house chicken. Marked spicy. Not overly spicy but I am used to eating some very hot foods so I am not always the best person to ask. My wife got the Orange Chicken. Wow. We got enough food to feed 4 or 5 people. Depending on how hungry you are there is enough food to feed 3 people in each meal. The food was good, and temperature was hot, hot as they cook it while you wait. Much better than the other Oriental food places in the area. I will be back. Many times.  This place just got started. Go see them. You will enjoy your food and service.

This was my 4th trip. Every time I am treated like a valued customer. The lady that I believe is the owner always comes out and checks several times to make sure everything is to your liking.  As always we get more in an order than you can eat. You can't get better value anywhere. Two can eat from one meal. This makes the outing very inexpensive if both people can agree on what to eat. They have a great menu. I especially like the house chicken.  The quality of food is excellent. Everything is fixed fresh while you wait. The rice is a very good quality. Cooked correctly, never mushy as in many other places.  You can't get a better quality anywhere in the area. Go see them!! You will be back often.

Kinda on the fence of between a three and a four star. My daughter lives not far form this Dillon's. We have eaten at two of their places in the Phoenix area had their food is good.  This Dillon's is at the Wild Life Zoo and has a large aquarium in the dining area. I found the food to be good and enjoyed watching the fish in the aquarium. There were many people with children eating there as you would expect, being it is at the Zoo. I enjoyed watching them looking at the fish mostly sharks.  The service was a little slow even though the place was not crowded but we did not mind as there was 7 of us there and we enjoyed talking and catching up.  Would I go back? Yes if I was in the area.  My grandson enjoyed the fish. Especially the Piranha that was in a small aquarium in the lobby.

I am not a Thai Restaurant expert I have eaten at several all have been slightly different in the taste of the food. There will always be disagreements as to how it should taste. As I have said many times before I do know what tastes good "to me".  This was my second visit. Do not remember what I had the first time except it was good and the service was excellent. Act sincerely glad you are there to eat.  The second visit I had the Ginger #10 on the menu with pork. If you like ginger this meal was excellent. I will remember a long time the taste of that first bite. This is a must try if you have not already. It had been several weeks since I was there last time. The staff recognized I had eaten there before and came out to say they were glad I had chosen them for lunch. Made me feel special.   You are greeted with a bowl of soup. Both times before I had received a menu to order. I thought this was a very nice touch. The dishes are generous in proportion. There is always much more than I can or should eat. Two people could easy eat off one dish and be fine. Better yet take three people order two different meals and share.  Decor is pretty much oriental. Not much to say but it is appealing and appropriate for a Thai Restaurant. Very neat and clean, clean. Quite and low lighting.  Will I go back. Yes I am planning on doing so next week.   My rating is a four not because I did not get a excellent meal or service. I do not give out 5's easily as I used to. One more trip that was good as the first two and I will revise this to 5 stars.   Give them a try.

Have not had breakfast here but have tried several times to eat lunch there. At noon there has been a lot of people so I went somewhere else. Yesterday I was able to get there at 11:30 and sat at the counter. The waiter was extremely nice. The decor is what I would call modern or trendy. Clean. I was in the mood for a simple grill cheese sandwich. It is on Sourdough bread two kinds of cheese. Got a cup of Tomato Basil soup. Both was very good. I got Ice Tea which was kept full. Several checks to see if everything was OK. They are very worth a visit.  If I ever get in downtown at breakfast time I will probably give then a try. Remember To Eat Good Food.

My wife..... If you read my reviews you will probably see this often as she will suggest a place one or her friends has visited.  The decor? This is a typical sports bar that has opened in the morning to serve breakfast.  We got there early and when we were seated i checked Yelp for reviews. Reviews were not so good. But they all seamed to be from afternoon, night hours. I can't talk to what may happen in the afternoons. But the breakfast was very good and inexpensive. The service was good. As long as we set there they served us coffee. No rush.  If you want a good inexpensive  breakfast? Go see them,

I am on jury duty and I have picked a different place to eat everyday. Today it was Enjoy Sushi. I probably should of known  better as it is pretty much a self serve. Fast place to get something to eat. They do make sushi trays to order or do as i did pick from a refrigerated show case. I chose a tuna roll. For the $7.99 the roll was a good proportion. No complaint over the price. I took the pre packed box and went to a nice quite place to eat. The tuna had a slight fishy taste to it. Not a good sign. Finished and for the next 3 hours I burped a fishy taste. One time is really not a good way to judge a place but I am not going back. To many other places in the area to eat.

What can I say but WoW! My wife recently read about this place in the paper.  If you did not know it was there you would probably never find this place. It is situated off 51 ave. just north of Thunderbird.There is a strip of stores that run east and west and they are situated about half way down this strip of stores.  When I walked through the door I knew immediately I would like this place.  My wife and I shared a pastry and a couple of short bread cookies. Don't ask the names we just picked what we thought would be a good selection for a first visit. OH! You get a piece of chocolate free on your first visit.  I did not look at a menu but saw some of the specials posted on the walls. Now I am planning a trip soon to have breakfast.  Decoration is for me hard to describe. Comfortable, friendly, clean, a place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch, not just once but many times. There are two separate rooms where you can sit and eat plus outside. In the room we were in there was a wall with many different foods from England.  Even though they were very busy the owner and one of the helpers took time to talk to us.  Everything we had was very good. Or what I should say much better than good.  Give them a try. I know you will be as impressed as I was.

Head about it for some time and to day my son and wife invited us to go with them. This is a event I definitely want to go to again. Was a little disappointed as I was hoping for more choices of vendors. The selection was not bad. I chose Jamburritos Cajun Grille. The food was good but I probably will not get a Jamburrito next time. Nothing wrong with the food. It was taste but I am not necessarily a fan of the seasoning in the Jamburrito. Besides there is much more food to try. I also got a pastry from Mamma Toledo's. It was a cheese cake just don't remember what flavor. OH! It was good.  If you have not done this I suggest you do. It is an adventure. As Forest says Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are going to get.  I will wait till it cools of a little. There are tents with evap coolers but it is still going to be warm.  There are many more trucks around. I must search them out. Enjoy

My wife and I almost always head in the direction of Bell Road for lunch or dinner. Today I decided to head west and south. Saw Taps they were new to this shopping center.  Taps looks like a sports bar when you enter. Only thing there appears to be only 2 TVs or at least where we were sitting I could only see two both above the bar. The decor is appealing, fresh, lots of light coming in from outside.  We were seated and very soon offered drinks. When the drinks came to the table we had both decided on their special.  Soup and Salad. With this you get a tomato soup, as much as you want and a choice of several salads again as much as you want.  Not sure why but lately I have had a hard time getting soup that is hot. The soup came out at somewhere well below the state required 130 degrees. We sent it back asking to warm it up. We got it back it was warmer but still not hot. My wife's salad came out with her soup my salad came out a little later. I got the wedge. My soup and salad was very good. My wife also liked her meal. So the food gets a 4. The service was very slow. It took over 15 min to get the first of our meal to the table. I did order a second different salad as well as did my wife. This also took about 15 min to bring to the table. For what was going to be a quick lunch we were there about an hour. There was only 5 other tables in the place with people at them so the reason for being slow was not that it was crowded.  The plates bowles they used to serve the food in is extremely small. By the time you had eaten you salad it was all over the table. It is impossible to keep in the small bowel it is served in. If you put the same amount of feed in a larger bowel it would be much better.   The food was good, the service was not so good. Soup needs to be hot not warm.  Enjoy

On our second visit we waited about 10 minuets to be seated. Not because the restaurant was busy but because there was no on at the dest to seat us. I had find someone. The bar seemed to be full but very few in the restaurant side. It seems like the focus on the bar side. The food was good and if it was not for the poor service I would probably eat there occasionally. But there are many restaurants in this area that the service is much better.

I like their expresso better than the other chain places and would become a regular, except..... At the time of the day I want my expresso the line of cars on both sides is 12+ vehicles. They do serve you fairly quickly but still the wait is much longer than the other coffees shops.  The staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful. I would be there at least once a day if it was not for the line of cars. They desperately need another place in this area.

Trip downtown for flowers. Wife had seen or someone had told her about Matt's.  Wow! Did find a place to park but had about a 20 min wait. We were there fairly early on a Saturday morning and really did not expect this many people downtown for breakfast.   Decor was mostly just a large room with a small room and tables.  I am one or the people that say it is pretty hard to mess up breakfast. I am pretty much an egg, bacon, toast person. But there are many things you can do to make this breakfast great.  The eggs were cooked just perfect, the beacon was thick and taste, the potatoes were different from what I expected and were great, now the toast. I usually get rye toast as I did this time. Surprise it was marble rye. My favorite. This is the only place I Have ever gotten it at breakfast. My wife got the same breakfast only with sourdough and scrambled eggs.  The food was very good. The service was OK. I know there was a lot of people waiting to eat. I felt rushed.  When I am in the area at breakfast time I will be stopping in for a meal.

My wife and I come here quite often, just have not written a review.  Simular to many of the sandwich shops. Clean, open layout, appealing looks.  You order, get a number go to your table and your meal is delivered. I have many different sandwiches and soups. Everything has always been good. Friendliness? I would put them a cut above the rest of the sandwich shops.

Looked on Yelp for a sushi place close to my house. Sushi Catcher had some very good reviews. Headed over but when I got there I discovered they are close on Monday.  I went back on Thursday. (Today)  Decor? Nice neat, looked to be very clean. The usual as most I have visited. Sushi Bar where you could watch the Sushi Chef (probably the wrong terminology). I am not by any way a sushi expert. Different beers and saki advertisements on the wall.  I have never sit at the bar, so when it was suggested by my waitress I thought, Why not. What an education. The Sushi Chef, KC, Artist was never still. I was there for about half hour to maybe a little longer. I watched him make roll after roll. Plus many other dishes.  My waitress was very nice and tried to be helpful. But with my limited knowledge of sushi and her limited english we had to talk for a while for me to choose. My choice was a Rainbow roll and 2 pieces of tuna and 2 of salmon. And I got to watch my meal being sculpted. Quite a bit of education. You should do this some day if you have not already. Go see KC.  History for me. The friends I have been eating sushi with put a lot of wasabi and soy sauce. I do like the wasabi, but it does mask the taste of your meal.  As I watched KC i noticed he took a lot of pain to make sure everything was done just right. I noticed when he made the sushi he would put a little wasabi on the rice before he put on the meat. This time i thought I would eat my sushi without any additional wasabi or soy sauce. This was a very good choice on my part. By doing this I was able to really get the taste of the sushi. I did try putting a little wasabi and soy sauce of a couple of like pieces. I preferred the pieces without the additional wasabi. Other observations is his pieces of sushi were thicker than most places I have been. OH, and after the meal I asked the waitress what i should have to finish off this fine meal. She suggested Mochi Ice Cream.  Two balls of ice cream wrapped in a soft dough. These had been cut in 2 pieces. Yes this did finish a fine meal right. I will continue to go to other sushi restaurants but I will make many trips back to this place. To date this is by far the best I have had. Do try them.

Remodeled hotel. Used to be the Lady Luck. We had gotten an invite to stay for free, we just had to pay the resort fee of $11.00. The room we had was very nice.  We usually stay on the strip when we go to Vegas. Staying downtown was OK. No problem going where we wanted.  The slots were better than most places we played. On very little we got to play for many hours. I don't go to Vegas to win. I go to Vegas to get out of Phoenix for a couple of days, relax, watch people. This hotel provides a great place to do what I like, just chill out for a couple of days.  When I go back to Vegas I will definitely consider staying here again.

Wife and I was at the outlet and it was past time for something to eat. We had initially intended to eat at a restaurant next to this one. This space has been vacant for several years so we thought why not give them a try. They have been in business for three weeks. It is primarily a sandwich, pizza (flat bread), shop. We got a chicken flat bread pizza and a chicken salad. We shared and this was plenty for us to eat. There was 4 pieces of pizza about 3" by 3".  The place was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.   Pluses for me. Very very nice people, local owned and operated, good selection, convenient place to eat when at the outlet. This will bring me back many times to sample other items on their menu.  Minuses ?? None at this time.   Go see them, support your local businesses.

Lunch time. Was at a friends house and he suggested the Taco Guild.  What a neat place for lunch. Worth the trip just to see the inside of the old church it is located in. Beautiful stain glass windows.  Now for the food? I got three different kinds of tacos. Don't remember but I think there were about 8 different ones to choose from. These tacos were what I would call street tacos. I may be wrong with my definition but that is what they reminded my of. Lot of other stuff on menu but only tried the tacos. The ones I had was good. I will definitely return. The service was good and everyone was friendly. Their lunch pricing was very good for the quality and quantity of food.  Now the bad. As with most of the new places it is noisy. Hard to carry on a conservation with the people that are with you. Maybe if you can't talk to your lunch partner you hurry up and eat and leave, making room for the next people??? Anyhow I will return as I like the old church and the food.

We were in Scottsdale for a movie and has an hour to wait. It was eat now or after the movie. Eat now won out, now where. I Yelped and found C3 Kitchen.  The person that took our order was very refreshing. Very helpful, friendly, and funny. This place is what I would call trendy in decor. Pretty much a sandwich shop. The food is reasonably priced. There are two roll up garage type doors that can be opened when the weather permits. When the food came it was good also. I will go back when I am in the area.

I have several favorite breakfast restaurants i go to often. Every once in a while you just want to go somewhere else. Opened up Yelp this morning and started looking. LW's was a drive but looked interesting. My wife likes cinnamon french toast and they had a different take on french toast.  Surprise, surprise, when we got there I saw a very familiar building. Campbell's, I had stopped here many times years ago on my way to the lake and my children had spent hours here as this was the only place open late. Now it is LW's. Waitress said it changed names about 1 and a half years ago. Basically a square two story building with the restaurant in the bottom. There is plenty of seating inside and outside, weather permitting and this time of year it would be a nice place to eat. Nothing fancy, wood floors, I believe it would call the decor rustic. (thats what my wife said) My wife liked the french toast and I also had a piece. It was good. I had my standard, 2 eggs over easy. I was surprised when they actually came to me over easy. Most places serve them over medium or over well. I enjoyed my eggs. The hash browns had a new flavor to them I could not identify. They were excellent. Only down for the meal was they forgot to bring my toast. I really did not need it but I did expect it to come with the meal. Instead when I mentioned it, it was delivered immediately. Meaning it was the piece I ordered but was now hard and cold.  Even with that I gave them 4 stars as everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  As for returning I will but it will be because I am in the area. Just to far to travel for breakfast. Go see them I think you will enjoy.

I like to see new places and I like to see them prosper. The place has not been in this the Park West mall for long. We was at the Farmers Market that is there on Saturdays. It was around 1:00 pm and we had not eaten. New place lets give it a try. Located next to Harkins.  On going inside the place is kind of like other taco, burrito, burrito bowel places. You put your order on a piece of paper and go wait. Your food is delivered to your table.  There was one other party there and one person ordering. I watch people and no one appeared to know what their job was. There were plenty of people but they just seemed disorganized.  The ice machine was not working so your drinks were warm. There is a Safeway one mile away where you could get ice. It is the cost of doing business when something breaks.  I got a quesadilla supreme, my wife got a chimi. The cheese in the quesadilla was not fully melted and was not very good. My wife's chimi was cold. She took it home and heated it up. When heated up it was not bad.  Everyone was friendly. We was given a discount because it took so long to get the meal and they gave my wife bottled water because they did not have ice for ice tea.  I will not be back, too many good places to eat. I do hope they get it together.

Just stopped for expresso. Everyone very friendly and helpful. There is outside seating and this is where I enjoyed my two shots of Expresso. If I am in the area I would stop again as their Expresso is good.

This place was call Yu's when it opened. If you want to read the reviews look them up. I believe this place sold a year ago as there was new people at that time. The menu has not changed and the food seems to still be prepared fresh and with quality ingredients. One order will feed two people easy. We usually just get one meal and split it unless we want something in the refrigerator to eat during the week.The lady that is behind the  counter is super nice and helpful. We eat there a couple times a month and when people are in town we always take them there once during their stay. This is a local owned business and they do a great job. If you are in for Chinese give them a try.

In Mesa today shopping for Christmas present. Lunch time. Made a call to my son. He does a lot of driving and knows a lot of good places to eat in this area.  My wife and I got sandwiches and enjoyed them. Very friendly staff.

Do I give a 3 or a 4? I go to their stories because they are clean and I can get protein without the bun. They are good for a burger as that is all I get at their location. My wife and grandchildren like to go there because of the selection of food for the grandchildren. Always find something each one wants and will eat. The servers are always friendly and eager to help. They always come by the table to see if you want it cleaned of your finished items and to ask is everything is OK.

I have been getting a pedicure here for the last 3 years. Probably every couple of months. I usually get a hard time from the lady that manages the place because I don't come more often. All in fun. She is extremely nice and always asks about my wife if she is not with me. Any time I walk by and she see me she always takes the time to say hi.  I know people worry about the cleanliness of the places that give pedicures. Here they are always changing and upgrading procedures to make the place as clean as possible. The tools always come out or a sealed pack. The foot soak is done in a lined resolver. This liner is always changed for a new client. At this time I have had a pedicure from all the ladies that work there. Sure I have my favorites but everyone does a excellent job.

This is my third time with Food Truck Friday West.  The first time they were at a church in the area. The parking was terrible, there was no where to sit and the selection was poor. We did not stay to eat. The second time was at the Peoria Sports Complex and this is the place I wrote my first review for. The Sports Complex is a large place and there is a lot of walking to do. There was plenty of tables and chairs.  Now for my latest excursion. This time they were downtown Peoria. This was a hit with me. The trucks are in a smaller area (plenty of room). Not as much walking to do. Seems they are getting this figured out and there were a lot more trucks to select from. There was plenty of tables and chairs to sit at in a grassy area where the children could play. I got a burger from Burgers Amour. It was reasonably priced and fixed just the way I like.  Don't have it completely figured out but I think they still be at the Sports Complex some Fridays and in downtown Peoria a times. When they are in Peoria I will be there to eat often.

Looking for a nice place to eat in the Peoria, Glendale area. Has previously seen this place getting off Grand and going into Glendale. From outside this place is fresh looking. New paint, new signage. Kind of an odd location for a restaurant and not very fancy from the outside. I looked at the reviews and menu. It was a little pricy but this was a special occasion we were celebrating. I had already been to several of the other pricy places in the Peoria, Glendale area and none really impressed me even though they had some good reviews. So time for a new place.  Inside the decoration was simple. Large room with booths along the wall and tables in the center. Open ceiling, nice hanging lights. This seems to be common to many places I have been as of late. Simple and open. I am not necessarily fond of this type but this seems to be the new norm. I like something to look at while I wait for my meal.  I read the reviews. I almost never read the 4 or 5 star reviews as they only tell you the restaurant got everything perfect. The real test of a great restaurant is how they react when things don't go as planned.  I got a 16oz. T-bone (rare), green beans, and onion rings. My wife got the 8oz. sirloin with carrots and bake potato. My steak was properly cooked and very tender. My wife's steak was very well done. (not as ordered) supposed to have a pink center. We told our server and he took it back. Shortly the manager appeared and apologized for the mistake. Soon he reappeared with a appetizer of beacon wrapped shrimp, big shrimp and delicious. Way beyond my our expectations.  Our server was Edwardo, I did not get the managers name. Edwardo was excellent. Not under or over serviced. Just the right amount of attention. If you are lucky you will get him. He is good.  Why a 4 and not a 5? I rarely give a 5 first visit and as of lately I must go at least two times to get a 5.  How good was the service and food? I am planning a return trip and I already know what I want. An order of the shrimp with green beans and a small salad.  I enjoyed my meal and the great service.

Really not fair to cut them too deep. This is not where the casino will be it is to be a warehouse when the casino opens. I knew going in that there was no alcohol or card games when I went. Hey I listen to the news and that has been clearly discussed. My first intention was to give them a 3 but it is not really OK. But it may be the best they can do with what they have. I do not like the machines as I go to Vegas occasionally and even there their selection of machines have wandered from what I really like. I liked the old Vegas machines 30 years ago.  Back to Desert Diamond. I am not what you would call a gambler. When I go to gamble I limit my day to $40.00. If I go through half of than to fast I quit at $20.00.  Any way here I went through $20.00 way to fast. I will probably go back and for sure when they get it finish, but for now I will just do the drive to Vegas. So much more to do there than gamble and my money goes farther.  At this point  would give them a try if you just want to play slot machines.  What I liked: Free soft drinks and coffee, free valet parking ( I did give them 2.00) What i did not like: slot machine selection, money did not last long enough (I don't mind giving them my money, just let me play longer. Smoking.

I am going to start with 4 stars which means I will definitely be back.  They have been working on this place for months and finally it is open.  Friends or ours went today and brought me a chilled coconut. I really enjoyed it. The only time I ever get one is when we go to the park and swap at Aloha Stadium. First thing I look for is a coconut, then shopping. Theirs was good. There was plenty of water. Then it was out to the garage to get a hammer.  The coconut meat was of an ok thickness. My wife will not touch the coconut and it is not for everyone. If you have been wanting one they have it.  My wife got a mini dinner of BBQ chicken and there was plenty of food. She brought enough home for a meal tomorrow. I got the mixed BBQ dinner. Yes I ate it all and now am so stuffed I wish I had saved some for tomorrow also. There is actually enough in that dinner for two people. Plenty of meat and two scoops of rice. I am not an expert of Hawaiian BBQ but I do know what I like and this was very eatable and priced well.  The people working there were very friendly and helpful. Hopefully they stay this was.  There were plenty of customers coming and going. I am pleased they are in Peoria and not far from were I live. Gives us another place to eat occasionally. Being on a low carb diet I will only be eating here on my eat what I want days.  Support your local business and give them a try.

My son got us a gift card for Christmas.  We had tried to eat there a few weeks ago but it was after the lunch hour and they had just closed to start getting ready for dinner. It was our anniversary and we arrived around 5:30. Offered seating inside or on the patio.  Southern Rail is located on Camelback along side the light rail. If you did not know they were there you would probably miss them. Parking lot is small. At the rush hour it will be hard to find a spot.  Not sure what you call the decor. The tables are made of channel iron and angle iron with wood set in for the top. Very simple. Waiters all had on blue  jean.  The decor and the dress of the waiters made me feel very comfortable.  We chose to eat on the patio. There were so many tables inside, looked cluttered.  Patio was great. Nice relaxed atmosphere plenty of room.  Ty was our waiter and did a superb job. Seemed to just know when we needed something. Spent time to answer questions. I wanted the blackened prime flatiron but the pairing of the vegetables was not what I wanted and they were not willing to substitute what I wanted. And that is fair. Everyone has their rules.  I got the chicken with biscuit dumplings. The meal was very taste. Definitely a good choice. Just a comment, the dumplings were not cooked on the broth. They were oven cooked, cut up and added to the chicken. I am from the south and I have never had or would call these dumplings. This does not mean I did not enjoy the meal. Just that is not how it is done in the South.  When I go back I will again sit on the patio. Very relaxing, even with the street noise, which was not so loud that it made conservation hard.  Oh! My wife had fried chicken and it looked delicious and she said it was very good. Plenty left for a meal at home.  I will definitely be back. Give them a try. If you luck out you will get Ty for a waiter.
