The food, and the bartender Daryl,  were amazing.  If you like a green chili and spicy, this is your place!!! Yummy!

Absolutely horrified. I just got back with lunch, I bite into the sandwich and this absolutely disgusting giant gooey, rubbery tendon like thing is there. I have never been more grossed out. See picture. So long for chicken.

They are consistent and delicious. Definitely ask for the hot salsa, much better than the house salsa. Best Mexican north of the 101 and south of Cave Creek highway.

This place was nothing short of amazing. I cant wait to throw another party and get more mini b undt cakes! I got the assortment of their four best sellers, but my personal fav is the lemon!  Yum :-)

This place is AWESOME!  I might be a little biased as I had never had a spray tan previously,  but they were just wonderful in making you comfortable and talking you through it. I went with two other girls who have had them before and they agreed this place was The best.  The tan lasted about two weeks and I just absolutely loved it. Can't wait for another reason to get another one!
