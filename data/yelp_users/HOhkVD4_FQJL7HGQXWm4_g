Stopped in yesterday to try out something new. Wow it was amazing. We made it in after lunch and was pleasantly greeted. The decor reminded me of the kinds of Mexican restaurants I ate at 15 years ago very traditional. We had four dishes cheese crisp, machaca chimmy, sour cream taco, and rellendo(my Spanish spelling is horrible).  Everything was amazing and the tab was only $30 dollars. The server was super friendly and professional, I will be back many more times!!!

Horribly slow service!!!! Food is nothing to rave about. Came in on my lunch break from work, from walking in to eating was 15 minutes. When I arrived the line had only one person that was being helped. My order was taken and before it could be finished the employee stopped helping me and attended to another customer who arrived after me for a pick up. Then my order was then finished by another employee who walked in from the back. After being rung up. I was told to have a seat I then waited until several other people were rung up for the food to be brought to the table without silverware. Very inefficient setup up employees obviously have no table service experience and while this was all going on the manager was chatting with a customer. Looks like jack in the box will be my new lunch spot.

Excellent calamari probably some of the best I've ever had. I had the garlic spinach calzone and it was great, although too much garlic for my taste. I found the service to be very on point in every way. Food came out quick and hot. Sangria was great too.  I went during happy hour and was a little surprised at the prices but felt like the value justified the price.

Love this shop. Currently getting a %100 custom half sleeve from Danny Ross. I've had a few sessions and the shop is always clean and everyone there is very welcoming. Danny took his time to talk to me about what I wanted to do, he added his input and worked WITH me to create the perfect piece. I've never felt rushed or pressured into getting work I wasn't totally sold on. I have a bit more to go on my arm before I can start my next at this shop.... Check out the shop and you will be very pleased!!

Went in and got no help for about thirty minutes. Finally a salesman was free and I informed them I was sent over from another location including what I was looking for. I got three bike literally pointed at and offered no information about the bikes. When I asked about a fourth bike the salesman said "it's a nice bike" I literally talked myself into a bike that was double my budget and the sales guy completely dropped the ball. I will never shop there or recommend that shop to ANYONE. Go to the Scottsdale location and you will be very well taken care of.

Currently taking lessons from Nick O. And having a blast learning how to play guitar. Nick is great at determining how well I've progressed through the week and through practice. Very talented guitarist and very skilled instructor.

Ordered pizza tonight and it had obviously slid around cheese all to one side and wing sauce in the pasta... Just a mess, they offered to correct this with another delivery they pick up the food when dropping off the new order. So far everything routine until the driver tried to tell me the management is upset that they had to replace my order and apparently my roommate had a similar issue last week. I would love to know how this is my problem or why they felt a need to express their disappointment about have to replace their mess up. I delivered food for a several years and I couldn't imagine talking to a customer like that. I've been ordering for 2 1/2 years and never had a problem before this. Don't really see a need to continue ordering from them.

Had my bike in cyclewerks twice for two different issues. The mechanic took can of everything I needed and help me understand the mechanics of the bike (I'm very novice). Both French and the mechanic chatted with me and offered suggestions and service for all my needs without jacking the price up.. French even offered for me to bring in bikes I'm considering buying to have inspected to aid in a great buy. They have earned my business for the life......

I'll start out with saying I have eating here several times and have tried almost every item on the menu. The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the owner stops by to check on our food every time I have been in. I would recommend going with a friend and sharing everything so you can try more items. My favorites are the Pig Ear, Grilled romain heart, and smoked brisket.
