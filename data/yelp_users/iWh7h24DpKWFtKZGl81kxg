My dad wanted to go here for Father's Day, and I hadn't been before...ended up being me, my boyfriend, my brother and my dad, my boyfriend being the only one who had been here before (yet was ambiguously unhelpful regarding the menu and how good it was). I had the Rei-Shabu (rare sliced beef on cold noodles), Dad had pad thai, the brother had pork katsu, and boyfriend had hakata (pork ramen). We started with some appetizers...summer rolls, the boys had a spider roll, and we had an order of the Cajun soft-shell crab. My beef and noodles were delicious, not as rare as I had expected (this was a good thing, I was a little nervous after I ordered it), the summer rolls were good, but the Cajun soft-shell crab was AMAZING. My dad is from Boston and eats a lot of seafood and we eat a lottttt of crab and this was one of the better places in Phoenix I've had soft-shell crab. It wasn't overly fried like some places (ahem, RA) and the Cajun seasoning was amazing, along with the dipping sauce (I ended up pouring the leftover sauce over my noodles - YUM)...if you are a fan of crab, you have to try it! Overall, everything was great, everyone loved their food, decent prices and something for everyone (next time we might try the Italian items...interesting mix of food at this place!).

I loveee happy hour at this place. Good beers and the happy hour sushi/appetizers menu is awesome! Brought a friend here who did not like sushi, but had some of the Asian chicken nachos and loved them (they are pretty freakin' fabulous). I haven't had anything here that wasn't awesome.

This review is a month late, but I figured it's still important to give praise where praise is due!  I have a little Papillon mix girl who has...difficult hair. It just grows like crazy, and she licks it into a frenzy, and ends up looking like a Gremlin or a deranged Furby.  We moved recently and I was looking for a good groomer in the area. I am "that" person that cries dropping their dog off at the groomer (she is almost 10 years old, I have pretty much given up on that changing at this point), but I researched and found P&F and when we dropped her off, I knew she was in good hands. And she came out looking amazing! Most groomers end up doing something weird with her ears or face, but this was the perfect grooming job. Her tail was shorter than I expected, but it was most definitely a good thing because she likes to poop directly on it when she's doing her business. ...Such a lady. Anyway, she looked beautiful, and P&F gave us a complimentary bag of chicken jerky treats - if you want to buy them, all the proceeds go to a local rescue. Nice staff, fantastic grooming job, and they support animal rescue...I am sold!

I was sitting at work the other day and had this sudden craving for Greek food. I'd already used my lunch break to sit around NOT eating anything, so I told my stomach to shut up, ate a cracker, and did some Googling to find somewhere close to my office, and planned on going there the next day to satisfy said craving. I looked at their online menu a little bit before driving to their location, and thought I might get the Little Taste of Greece (I think that's what it was called, anyway) and give some to a coworker, since it had moussaka, spanakopita, dolmas and a side Greek salad, which all sounded heavenly. I got to the restaurant and stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone realized I was there, but finally the phone rang and someone came out front to get it and very nicely took my order. I was sad indeed to see that on their menu they had changed from moussaka to lamb for the LTG plate I'd planned on getting...this beezy does not eat lamb, ever, end of story. (Instant My Big Fat Greek Wedding scene pops into my head.) But, oh well, I was running short on time anyway so I just ordered a Greek salad and tzatziki. Cost less than I expected and it was ready quickly. Got back to my office and did not realize that the Greek salad was the size of a small house - only ate about half of it, but it was delicious. Their dressing is excellent. The tzatziki was also awesome, had lots of cucumber in it and fresh dill on top, and the pita...oh, don't get me started on the pita. I probably ate half my body weight in pita that day. It was warm and soft and I could pretty much write a ballad about it. I'm hoping to go here one day when I have more time, maybe for dinner after work since it's right around the corner, that way I can order something a little more substantial than the salad...and if their salad and tzatziki were that good, I have high hopes for everything else on the menu!

Lisa in grooming is amazing. My furry nightmare licks knots into her hair as soon as it starts getting long and I am awful about taking her in as often as I should thanks to my schedule, but Lisa has done an amazing job with her and we will continue to visit - hopefully on a more frequent basis! :)

Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. I hate reading reviews where the person just complains and complains, but...this is about to be one of those reviews.  Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, "Hmm" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.  There are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here.

Have been neglecting this place terribly recently, but a friend and I used to go here many nights a week for a late-night drink...Gwen is AMAZING at the bar, we love her...she's attentive, hilarious, nice, everything. The food is better than your average bar fare and they usually have a good drink special going...the karaoke is hilarious to watch ;) Interesting mix of people, great place to people watch and just hang out. Love this place!

My experience is directly related to the alterations department. The service I received in the store when ordering my dress was fine.  I bought a bridesmaid dress for a friend's wedding four months before the wedding. The dress came in earlier than expected, which was nice since I had to order extra length and was concerned with the initial delivery date they gave me. However, I had been losing weight somewhat steadily since ordering the dress, and had informed DB of this. They told me "Sure, just make sure you come in for alterations no later than mid-March for alterations to make sure it is done in time" (and 3-4 weeks would apparently still be a "rush" and cost more).  I called with a little over a MONTH until the wedding, and was told by the lady in alterations "Even if we had an appointment available this week, the dress would not be ready in time for the wedding." I am a little confused as to how they would not be able to complete the alterations in a month - it's not like it involves putting in a corset or a bustle or anything crazy that the actual wedding gowns may need. It just needed to be taken in, I had lost 20 pounds and it was loose. I was then told "Well, if you've lost that much weight, maybe you should just buy a new dress." Are you kidding me? I just paid for this dress, and paid an additional charge because I needed it in extra length, and you're suggesting to just buy a new one? First of all, way to basically say "We can't help and I don't really care". Second of all, you of all people, working in the alterations department, should know that extra length dresses are special order, and it wouldn't even come in in time for the wedding. Thirdly, it's not like I bought a size 10 and suddenly needed a size 0. I had maybe lost 2 dress sizes. They told me to call the Scottsdale location to see if they had any open appointments. I didn't even bother. An alterations shop recommended to me by multiple people (and has a 5-star review on Yelp) was able to get the dress altered in five days (yes, five, and that wasn't even a rush order) and it looked amazing and fit perfectly. I definitely suggest going to a different place to get your dress altered!!!

I'm so torn on RA. (I know. I'm a brave person, getting up and going to work everyday and functioning with such a heavy load on my shoulders.)  Really though...I feel like I should have outgrown RA by now, but I haven't. I initially went to the Tempe location back in the day when I was 18 and hated sushi (forgive me, I was young and stupid. Mostly stupid) and ate noodles every time I was forced to go there by my ex or my friends. Now I am pretty well-versed on the sushi world and eat it every chance I get.  No, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. ("I wish I knew how to quit you"...)  I WANT to hate RA, mostly due to the douchebags it tends to attract, at ANY of the locations (we live in 'Tukee now, so obviously we frequent this location a lot), but I still can't. We went a few weeks ago for happy hour with some friends, and it was busy (of course). No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink or two while waiting for our table. They told us 15-30 minutes and we realized it had been longer than that...went up to check on our spot and lo and behold, our buzzy-thingy was not working and they had skipped us on the list and because of this, have missed the happy hour cutoff. NOOO! I needed me some cheap dranks and sushi! We sat down, the waitress talked to the manager about what happened, and the manager came over and talked to us, apologized, and let us know any food we ordered (sadly not alcohol as well, but I understand why not) would still be happy hour pricing. Pretty cool, as some places would have had a pretty "oh well" attitude about it.  Overall, RA is like crack, and once you've had it, you'll develop a habit you just can't kick. Pass the soft shell crab roll, please...

My brother suggested going here a while back for some reason, and I wasn't expecting a whole lot. The buffet-style dishes were the usual Chinese food fare, and they weren't bad at all. What I LOVED though was the sushi! There is an area where they will make you fresh sushi, lots of roll selections, and it's included in what you already paid. For the amount of sushi we ate, we would have spent a LOT more somewhere else, plus we got all the yummy crab puffs, noodles, etc. Going to try and go again soon!

I love PIAS! I remember going to a different location when I was a kid and I needed volleyball equipment and the like. It's kind of hit or miss, since a lot of the equipment is used, but when you do find something good it's a deal. I tried the location in Chandler and was disappointed to find a miniscule hockey selection, and 99% of what they did have was youth hockey gear anyway. They did have a great bag though that I snagged for $25 - the model I bought runs about $65-80 new, and this one is scuffed but that's about it - zippers work great and no thin patches or tears. The employee steered me to the Mesa location upon ringing up my bag, telling me they had the biggest hockey selection out of the stores. I drove over and checked it out, and they do have a decent adult ice hockey section. I was able to find some sticks worth looking at (new and used), pants, and TONS of shin guards. I asked how much they would charge for me to bring in my skates for heat molding, since I didn't buy them at PIAS (I won't do used skates - pass. But they DO have new skates at this location as well, I just got a killer deal on mine online) and most places charge you to heat mold if you didn't actually buy the skates there. The guy let me know to just bring them in and they'll do them for free, as well as sharpening. Sold! I will be buying a lot of gear here in the near future.

The only reason Chandler Regional Medical Center gets 2 stars in this review is because of the majority of the medical staff. I know, you would think as long as you have great physicians, nurses and techs that your experience would be just dandy, right? Except not.  I've worked for multiple hospitals and trust me, I know everyone loves to complain about the emergency room. I literally had a patient with a cold tell me he was a "higher care priority" than a woman being brought back while actively receiving CPR. Everyone seems to think they are the most important and most fragile, sick, on-the-verge-of-death person in that waiting room. This is not that kind of complaint about the hospital. I was not "dying" either time I showed up and the medical staff took excellent care of me for the most part. Yes, nobody likes the recliners in place of beds, but I figure that's a sign they'll try and get you out of there ASAP, which I like. Only hypochondriacs want to hang out in the ER all dang day.  Anyway. I had no issues with CRMC in the past, but ever since the Catholic Healthcare West political fiasco what-have-you, they have been AWFUL. I loved CRMC when it was under CHW. Now that it's Dignity Health, good effing luck.  I was seen twice at CRMC a few months apart in the emergency department (I know, awesome luck!). The first time we went straight to the ED, the second time I just went to urgent care thinking I had a minor illness and was transported from there to the hospital since I needed more extensive care. Doctors, great. Nurses, great. Techs, great. Just wait until you leave and get your bill. Then all hell breaks loose.  I have worked in patient access services. I have worked for several different hospitals, as I previously mentioned. For such a huge company, Dignity Health has the crappiest online bill payment website I could possibly imagine. For two separate visits, I had two separate bills (obviously). I had set up a payment plan for each one and yet when I go to make payments to them SEPARATELY, the payments always just get globbed together and applied to one account or the other, therefore marking my other account delinquent. Super fun to deal with. There is also no way to track your payment history through the website to show them you ARE NOT delinquent, and your payments take a MINIMUM of 7 days to post (they say maximum of 7 days but it's usually more like 10 or 15). Seriously? How is it that any other medical facility I have been to can manage to post payments faster than a two week turnaround time? I e-mailed for assistance, was told my information was being forwarded to the correct department because they "could not assist me with my question" (how would the "contact patient billing" option lead me to someone who couldn't assist me with a patient billing question?), and never heard back. Have e-mailed them again, and of course, have not heard back. Good luck calling them either.  Praying if I, God forbid, end up in the ED again any time soon that Chandler is not the closest hospital. Dignity Health, you have completely ruined the back office functions of a previously awesome facility. Congrats.

This is always the place I go to when I need a random accessory or a wig or whatever else for a party, event, etc. I couldn't find a cigarette holder to save my life (retro 1950s Christmas party - it was a necessity!), and I found not one but three to choose from at AFS. I've bought wigs there for everything you could imagine, from a hockey game to the Renaissance Faire, and they had several different options that would work for each event. They are also REALLY inexpensive for wigs - this is a plus for me since a) I'm not made out of money, sadly and b) I usually end up getting drunk in said wigs and trashing them anyway. I've found the same wigs somewhere else and they cost an arm and a leg (and these are cheap, non-human hair wigs - they should NOT cost that much!), and then went to AFS and picked it up for under $30. They have a really big selection, I just always seem to go there when I'm under a time crunch so I still haven't been able to look at everything. I am definitely a fan of this place.

I love Charlie's. Maybe because I'm not a gay man looking for a hookup, because yeah, I get what some guys are saying about the dudes there, but then again who knows what my taste in men would be like if I were a gay man? But, I digress.  I know a lot of guys (yes, gay ones) that frequent Charlie's on the regular, so maybe it's a different experience when you're hanging with regulars, but I LOVE it here. Good drinks, good people, lots of fun. I've never had the issue some girls complain about regarding gay guys not wanting women there, but hey, I'm 5'11", maybe they thought I was a guy. I think the gentlmen here have a right to not really enjoy a bunch of straight women coming in ("OMG! LOOK! GAY MEN! EVERYWHERE! IT'S MY BACHELORETTE PARTYYY! OMG DRAG SHOW! OMG YOU ARE LIKE SOOO BEAUTIFUL, I WOULD NEVER KNOW YOU'RE A MAN!") and taking over the place when it is a GAY BAR, for men. Don't intrude on peoples' boundaries and you should have an excellent time.

I've been coming here since I was a little kid, through all the location moves...so glad Mary Coyle's is still in business. No, it's not the same as when I was younger since they have new ownership, but the ice cream is still delicious. I remember when my brother and I were little, we would always get pippen Cookie Mans with my dad. Great memories. These days I opt for a Hula Bowl (sooo good if you love pineapple, cherry, and/or maple nut...their maple nut ice cream is something else!) or the Cherry Snow. The waitresses have always been very pleasant and attentive. I love this place, I hope they are around for a very long time!

Food is reallyyy good - I always get the cheese enchilada (and I hate enchiladas) with a beef taco, and the fish tacos are AWESOME too. They deliver really quickly. Side note: if you get it delivered, have exact change if you're using cash. EXACT change. One of the delivery guys always refuses to let us pay separately with cash when we order for lunch at work and it turns into a huge confusing mess...more dollar bills thrown all over the table than the stage at your local strip joint. Just either pay with a card or make sure you have the exact amount!

I went through every pet parent's worst nightmare, a huge emergency with my dog (aka my child). Yes, I'm one of "those" crazy people whose dog is their baby...luckily everyone here understands that. My barely-ten-pounds dog got attacked by a dog five times her size, and it was very, very bad. My mom had been watching her at the time, thought she was already dead when she finally got the other dog to leave her alone, and rushed her to Alta Vista, which is close to her house. They took her back right away and they took wonderful care of my baby, who had multiple puncture wounds on her neck (barely missing a carotid artery), and needed multiple sutures as well as a drain in her back. I took her back to have her sutures removed and they were quick and super, super nice, and understood my worries that she was healing properly, let me show them spots where she was still tender and addressed all my concerns. The medicine they gave her helped immensely and she was back at 100% quicker than I had expected, given how bad her injuries had been. I have worked in the veterinary field and have been to other hospitals I would NEVER recommend, but everyone here was absolutely great taking care of my baby girl and they were so wonderful during this emergency trip.

My drama queen dog giving me panic attacks yet again. She had been scooting for about a week but I didn't think much of it since she has never had an issue with expressing and has only had her anal glands expressed once as part of a comprehensive exam (and they didn't even end up having to do it, because the second they got remotely close to her butt, she freaked out and did it herself, all over the poor tech. Charming, I know.) All of a sudden she is crying, whining, constipated, won't even let me hold her, and her tummy is harder than usual. I try to get a look at her backside (the joys of dog parenthood) and can feel that her glands are definitely full and possibly impacted. I, of course, assume the worst and am imagining $5000 vet bills for ruptured glands/something else causing the issue/who knows what. I checked Alta Vista's hours (still open til 10 PM! YAY) and called to see how busy they were, and was told they were pretty cramped but to come in as a walk-in. They were lovely yet again when we showed up and Lucy didn't even need to see the vet - she was in and out with one of the techs in a short amount of time and came back to the waiting room a new dog after having her VERY full glands expressed. She has been her happy self since. The damage was under $20 and they were quick and nice as ever. We love Alta Vista!

Somebody recommended this place to me a long time ago and now I have been faithfully going here for years. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I had a friend who was homesick for any kind of Native food, and brought her here...she was so happy to see a place actually run by the Tohono O'odham Nation, AND it was absolutely amazing to boot. I always get the "everything possible on it" green chile frybread, and they never let me down...so so so good. They spice the meat perfectly and the frybread is to die for...you can't go wrong with any of the frybreads here, ever!

A-freaking-MAZING.  I went to high school with the owner's daughter (who now runs The Baker's Daughter next door, also fantastic), and this was a regular spot my friends and I would stop at in the morning on the way to school. I have only come to appreciate it more post-high school, and love this place! If I was forced to pick a favorite, I'd have to say the cheese puffs. There is nothing else like them on earth - sweet and the filling is amazing, the puff pastry is divine, oh goodness here I am crying while thinking about a pastry. Really, they are that good. The apple fritters are also fantastic. I know someone who stops here and buys a box of pastries whenever they are having a sales meeting or anything else at work, because seriously, NO ONE can be in a bad mood after eating ANYTHING from here and they pretty much worship the ground you walk on after you give them any of the sweet perfections from this bakery.

This place is good. Like, your doctor and everyone else's doctor hates it but secretly they eat it frequently good. We order for delivery here frequently since I work down the street, and I have never been disappointed. I always get a cheeseburger (simple enough, and it's so amazing), but the onion rings and malts are what make this place my favorite of all favorites for amazing unhealthy binge lunches. Get a side of onion rings and a vanilla Oreo malt and you can die happy (from a massive heart attack, but happy nonetheless).

I'm kind of a new patient (I say "kind of" because I had my initial exam/x-rays/cleaning done in June/July, and was supposed to go back for some more work and have just now gotten around to scheduling it...oops), and so far I really love this office. Dr. Pospisil was very friendly and efficient, and the scheduling ladies are WONDERFUL! They played e-mail tag with me today as I tried to schedule an appointment around my ridiculous schedule, and were so helpful and nice, and have been nothing but sweet both times I have been to the office. I have a horrible, horrible phobia of going to the dentist (the last time I went was to get my braces taken off and I had a panic attack right in the chair - talk about humiliating) and everyone at the office has understood this (for the most part - the dental hygienist doing my cleaning chastised me quite a bit for not having been in so long, even after I explained my anxiety, but she was still very nice overall). Nervous about my next appointment (merely because I HATE going to the dentist and always will), but I know they will be great!

Oh my gosh, I love this office. I just had to update because I've now been seeing Dr. P for almost a year, and this in itself is a miracle - before I would see a dentist, get my exam/x-rays/cleaning, and peace out. I'm still terrified of going, but the staff is just amazing and I get through every appointment 100% fine. They are so flexible with billing as well, which really helps out when you're getting a lot of work done. Dr. P is great, the staff is all great, and I am super happy I found them!

My friend brought up wings the other day, and I have thought of nothing else since. I caved today and decided to try this place out, since it's down the road from my office and they had good reviews. I placed an order to go - a dozen BBQ wings and zucchini (they were out of mushrooms - first bummer of the experience). They told me to head down in 10 minutes, which I was impressed by...I figured the wait would be much longer. I drove over, paid, and was out the door very quickly with my much-desired wing fix. I got to the office and had a couple - they were good, a LOT of sauce but they were a little crunchy, which I like. Tried the zucchini and was disappointed to find them covered in bread crumbs rather than batter (maybe this was my fault, I read the menu pretty quickly and wasn't paying much attention). I ate another wing and it didn't taste that great. Was pretty much full after that and went back to working...I don't know WHAT the deal was, but I got reallyyy sick about an hour later. Safe to say I won't be coming back any time soon.

We stopped here for lunch the other day, in the mood for something a little spicy (and cheap). I ordered the grilled steak tacos and boyfriend got the carnitas. I don't normally love pork, but we each traded one of our tacos and both kinds were delicious :] The salsa bar IS a little limited, but there were two that I loveddd so I didn't really need more options. Our total bill for chips and salsa (refills included), 4 tacos with rice and beans was $15.00...sold!!! Food was great, we will definitely be coming back!

Along with pretty much everyone else who has left a review for this place, I LOVE THIS PLACE. I went to high school in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical "hole in the wall" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.

Had this review been written a year or so ago, they would have gotten 4 or 5 stars. But, it is not a year or so ago and this place just continues to get worse over time. Used to be our go-to brunch spot, and was also great for Wednesday night trivia, but we have pretty much stopped going due to the last couple visits. Prices have gone up for everything for brunch while service has gone down. Bloody Mary bar has awesome selection, but you better stuff everything you can in there on your first go because somewhere down the line they decided, "Oh, yeah, not going to be doing the bottomless thing so much anymore" and didn't tell you, just charged you at the end when you had 3 vodka refills thinking they were covered.   Our last visit went somewhat like this... They refused to bring my friend brunch 5 minutes before the brunch hours ended (which used to be until 2, and is now 12 apparently), yet the couple next to us put in their order for brunch at 12:10 with the same waitress and they got the go-ahead. ...Uhhh? We asked our waitress five, literally five times, for some water after starting our meal. That was all, water. And somehow she managed to not pull that off over the span of an entire hour. BF and I shared fish and chips and it was just...I mean, really, my expectations for fish and chips in the States is not that high, I am aware it's not going to taste like the stuff you get in the village I lived in in North Yorkshire, but really. The fish should not be soggy on the outside and rock solid cold on the inside.   The staff is not entirely friendly recently and it just seems like suddenly money is all they care about. I get it, you have to make money to keep a place going, but plenty of other establishments manage to do it without becoming this crappy.

I'm really not sure why it took me so long to review this place. We moved to the neighborhood about 6 months ago and have been here several, several times because it is a) delicious, b) convenient, and c) super reasonable in price. I think between my boyfriend and I, we have tried most of the menu, and have not been disappointed yet. I do have to admit that I do not eat actual gyros (lamb, nope, no way, will never eat it), but the BF does and loves them here. For me it's usually a toss-up between the chicken breast pita and the mousaka. Both are huge and filling and sooo good. The pita comes with Greek salad or fries (both are awesome, and their salad dressing and cheese is my favorite anywhere), and the mousaka comes with rice. lemon potatoes, and Greek salad. (The lemon potatoes are to die for, FYI). I frequently end up ordering something sweet to take home as well, and their tiramisu is really good. You basically can't go wrong ordering anything here, it is all fantastic! Staff are all really nice and we have never had any issues with wrong orders, cold food, anything you might expect to experience once in a while. We love it!

Four months later and I still haven't set the apartment gate up with my phone number. I am the bane of the delivery driver's existence.  With that confession tossed out there, I ordered from Great Wok tonight. I came home after work, giddy with the thought of a three-day weekend ahead, and realized the only fish I had in the house was a very unappealing frozen piece of tilapia. The woes of Lent. I can't survive off of the wilted English cucumber chillin' in the veggie drawer, so I had to give in and order delivery (I have the horrible tendency of not leaving the house once I get inside and realize how comfortable the couch is. Unless something important is going on, like a hamster fashion show or Chumbawamba's reunion tour. You know. The big stuff), and it had to be either a) vegetables or b) seafood. Chinese clearly fit these categories beautifully.  I did not want a repeat of my last Chinese order, so I reexamined Yelp and found Great Wok again. Score. Called them. ...No answer. Determined to have some delicious Diocese-approved dinner (alliteration FTW), I made the fat kid in me chill out and called them again 5 minutes later, spoke to a very nice young guy, and ordered crab puffs, fried tofu with vegetables, and shrimp with vegetables. I hung up and realized I ordered enough for a small army (damn delivery minimums), and as a newly single lady that meant a lot of leftovers.  The time estimate I was given was 45 minutes, and the food showed up within half an hour AND the delivery guy did not call freaking out about my gate being closed. (Yesss...I don't have to feel like an asshole.) Gentleman shows up at my door and hands me my food, and I sign the receipt thinking "This better be worth $26effing94..."  Oh, it was. Shrimp that looked (AND TASTED!) like shrimp and not something my ten pound dog craps out on a walk. Crisp vegetables. Flavorful sauce and not pools of grease. Crispy crab puffs. I would have taken a picture to show the deliciousness of it all, but I began inhaling it too fast to even think about it. I have died and gone to Chinese delivery heaven, y'all. You will not regret ordering from this place...!

I got dragged here by a friend a while back. I hadn't eaten Chick-fil-A since it was on my college campus years ago, but I went along anyway. UGH. I guess this constitutes as "good" food if you grew up in a trailer, but otherwise...pass. 1) The chicken always has a weird strip on the end that makes me wonder what exactly it is. It's chewy and disgusting and I remember cutting it off every time I ate CFA in Flagstaff. 2) In true trailer park fashion, everyone has their dirty, loud, screaming children with them and let them run wild, usually barefoot or with a dirty diaper sagging two inches from the floor. I'd rather not eat than eat somewhere like this again.

I hate pizza.  Really, I do. I guess specifically I hate marinara sauce, to be fair. But I LOVE Mellow Mushroom.  Get the Yukon Gold, Philosophers Pie or Holy Shiitake. So good, and none have red sauce if you're a hater like me. The crust is amazing. Their Enlightened Spinach Salad is also awesome - spinach, candied pecans, dried cherries, apples, and vinaigrette. They also have Wyder's cider...win! Service can be a little slow but staff is always really nice.

To be fair, these guys ARE good at quite a few things. Pros: They called around all day looking for a part for my old vehicle I had at the time and were very courteous about everything. They did knock a good deal off the price for the services and labor for one of my visits. Cons: They are understaffed it seems, as a previous reviewer mentioned, and it definitely takes longer than they estimate for service...usually MUCH longer. I also went through a huge ordeal to get my power steering fixed, where they insisted they had to charge me to "test" adding more steering fluid and letting it run through the system entirely, when it was obvious where the leak was coming from and they could have just fixed it without doing that and charging me $40 for it. So I leave, the power steering is working great, smooth as all get-out...until about two weeks later. I paid to have it COMPLETELY FIXED and yet it's leaking all over the place again. The worst part is, I went in just to get my battery cables replaced, which they charged me for, then I opened the hood and realized they hadn't even done that, just the other $250 in work that I had racked up from bringing it in for a $10 cable change.

Two things you must have: the Cabo shrimp tacos, and the cilantro "salsa" (it's at the salsa bar, but it's dairy-based, creamy, and delicious). I went with a vegan and even they found something to eat that was reaaaaally good (vegetable burrito). Some of the salsas were really spicy, but all of them were awesome. Decor is great (chairs are a little heavy and make a crapton of noise if you move them, but I don't really think that's a dealbreaker, come on now), and yes, it's in a bad area (really guys, let's keep posting about locking our cars. Shouldn't you do that everywhere anyway? Most of the people I know who have had their cars stolen had them stolen from outside their houses, or at work, in BETTER neighborhoods than this. Get. Over. It), but overall it was fantastic, servers were attentive and very nice, and the food was YUM and at a good price.

I drove a 1995 Jeep Cherokee from 2004-2011. (She should have been put out of her misery long before that, to say the least.) I was used to going in to mechanics and coming out with a $2500 estimate. One garage employee once told me, "...Basically, after looking at your car, what we suggest...well, this car just shouldn't be on the road." I now have a new (well, new to me) vehicle, that was given pristine love and attention, probably by some dear old woman who maybe drove it 20 miles a week. I'm not the best at car maintenance (every boyfriend I have ends up chewing me out over letting a chip slowly destroy my windshield or the fact that my tires are balder than Mr. Clean), but I've taken decent care of this one. However, my brakes started sounding bad, I took my car in last July somewhere in Tempe, and it turned out there was a bigger issue was going on and I couldn't afford to get both my brakes and said issue fixed at once. Brakes were at 40% and could wait, the mechanic said.  I called Meineke on Thursday, after seeing some good reviews here on Yelp and finally having reached the terrified point regarding the sounds my brakes were making. Yes, at the time I was wishing I could have gone to one of the independent places reviewed on here (there were several nearby with great reviews re: service quality and price), but none of them were open Saturdays and my brakes (along with an oil change) drastically needed to be taken care of. Friendly guy answered the phone and I was surprised to find out they accepted appointments on Saturdays for brakes. A lot of bigger places don't do that, it's just a "show up and hope we can get you in with all these other poor unfortunate souls". I made an appointment for first thing in the morning.   Showed up today, and Mary was at their front desk. SUPER nice, SUPER friendly, and definitely more of a morning person than me. I explained that I needed my brakes done and an oil change, dropped my car off, and my ride and I headed back to my apartment. I got a call 30 minutes later, and my heart instantly began pounding. In my past Jeep days, this has always been the time when the service advisor tells me, ever so nicely, that my car is a gigantic piece of crap, and why do I still own it, and how has it not lit on fire on the freeway yet and tell you what, I know a guy who can make sure it disappears and is found torched in Mexico a month later. Mary said the brakes obviously needed work, and my front rotors DID need to be replaced (the car is at 103,000 miles and the rotors had not been replaced in quite some time so I was not entirely shocked), however the back brakes were just fine. Of course, my air filter was dirty (I know this is usually something car places usually tell everyone, but I am pretty sure mine has not been changed since I bought the car so I'll take her word for it), and there were some other minor issues she recommended getting taken care of soon, but not necessarily today (mostly my fluids needing to be flushed). She was not pushy in the LEAST about the other issues and gave me the quote for the brakes, oil change, filter replacement and fluid replacement. It was half as much as what I had put aside for the repairs. Granted, I did expect both front and rear would need to be done, and I also made a paranoid transfer to my savings account prior, expecting the worst, but still. I looked online for the average cost of front brake work and rotor replacement for my car model, and the price I was given was just under what most websites had estimated. I breathed a huge sigh of relief and Mary said she'd call me when my car was finished. They ended up getting the job done in about an HOUR total. I was pretty amazed. I know brake work is relatively simple in comparison to bigger jobs, but still, most places still make you wait around for three hours or so regardless. Paid for the repairs, and drove my car home, sans horrific attention-whore brake noises and grinding. I'll see how my car feels over the next few days, but so far I am way more impressed by this place than I had anticipated!

Have been ridiculously busy and put off my oil change far too long - but these guys were ready for me when I finally made it in! Had plenty of available appointment times and were done faster than they estimated, and charged a grand total of $25. I love this place...they send me reminders for my oil change along with deals for service every month. No reason to go anywhere else! Thank you, guys! :)

Okay, let me just say...THANK YOU JESUS!  So, I had a wedding I was in last weekend. The only drama I experienced was in regard to my bridesmaid dress. I had purchased the dress in December, as requested by the bride to ensure that they were ready to go for the early April wedding. When I bought the dress at David's Bridal, I explained that I had recently lost about 5 pounds and was going to lose more (I know, you can't guarantee that, people come in crying when the dress won't zip, etc. etc.). They still had me order a dress in a size that was pretty loose on me, so I figured okay, I'll get it altered once it comes in, no big deal. I paid for my dress, paid the additional charge for extra length (thanks, giraffe legs), and was on my way. The dress was delivered in like January, and to be fair, I procrastinated on getting altered. A lot was going on and I just did not have time, plus I was still losing weight and didn't want it to be too big come the big day. However, I called David's Bridal with over a month to go and they informed me "even if we had an open appointment, we could not get it altered in time for the wedding". Ummm, say what? So, I went into a panic until a couple people suggested getting the alterations done somewhere else. I was concerned about it, since if anything happened, the dress wouldn't be covered by David's Bridal's warranty, but I figured I had no other choice. By this time I had lost 20 pounds and it DEFINITELY could not go without being taken in.  I found The Fit on Yelp and it was an easy choice. They didn't require an appointment, everyone was SUPER friendly, and they gave me a five day turnaround time - and that wasn't even a rush order! I was ecstatic. Picked my dress up the day it was promised and IT.FIT.PERFECTLY. I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the gentleman that took my measurements, pinned the dress and checked me out when I picked up my dress (I am so bad with names, I am working on it!), but he was quick, so nice, and did an AMAZING job. The cost was much more reasonable than many other places and I would have happily paid more for the amazing job that was completed. I wore the dress this past Saturday and it looked perfect. Thank you guys, you saved my butt!!!

I stayed here a few weeks ago when my friend was getting married at Planet Hollywood. We chose Bally's because it was a) reasonably priced and b) connected to Paris, which is next door to Planet Hollywood. We checked in and the front desk employee asked us if we would like to upgrade to a suite for $25 a night. Was going to pass, but he told us it had a Jacuzzi, steam shower thing-y (clearly I was listening intently), more space, etc. We figured for 2 nights, why not, that's nothing split between 2 people. I am SO glad we did! I can't speak for the non-suites, but I LOVED this room. Walked in to a long hallway, huge bed, sunken Jacuzzi, big vanity on one side of the bathroom, etc. It was sooo worth the upgrade. Our key was a sonovabeeetch at first but it just took a little fiddling with to figure out the system's quirks. If you stay here and they have a decent rate on suites, go for it! Our room was in the South Tower, which is the BEST area of the hotel to stay in for convenience's sake - if you look, there are other rooms that are wayyy further back. Let's be honest, nobody wants to be that drunk beezy stumbling an extra mile in heels at 5 AM (and this, ladies and gentlemen, is why I wear flats in Las Vegas).

I needed a birthday cake for my mother, who has some dietary restrictions. Usually you can find a place that is vegan OR gluten-free, but not both. I found Treehouse on Google and was so happy to find that you could request certain flavors be gluten-free as well as vegan and they had lemon lavender, which was right up my mum's alley. I called and ordered the cake and Amanda helped me come up with the crossword design I wanted after looking at cakes they had on their website. I came in to pick up the cake and it was perfect! We didn't need a large cake so they couldn't fit "sixtieth" on the cake but made it work for the size of the cake I ordered. We cut the cake at dinner and it tasted SO good - not only did my mother love it, but my boyfriend, brother and I did as well and we do not normally go vegan/GF. I was so happy to find something she could eat that tasted so delicious. The girls were so nice and helpful when I came in to pick up the cake and I also got a couple vegan pumpkin cupcakes, which were so good. Thank you Treehouse for helping make my mum's birthday that much better with your delicious cake!

Okay, I literally just sat down after eating here and had to write this review. Aaamazing.  My boyfriend and I were at home deciding whether it was worth the effort to get up and go get dinner, due to the disgusting heat of course, and I decided to check out Yelp and see what sounded good enough to get me out the door. Found this place, and he had been there before, given he literally lives across the street. (This is now a dangerous, dangerous thing given how much I loved this place.)  Everyone who works here: super nice. We chatted for quite a while when placing our order and even got a recommendation for a Thai place down the road. I ordered the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, my boyfriend ordered pork schnitzel. Everything was fantastic. You get three salads and a side, my side was mashed potatoes (lots of dill, yummm) and I got sauerkraut, the potato salad and peas (I ended up getting the basil tomatoes when served by mistake, which actually was fine because they were delish...only thing that was "wrong" with our visit, which is not a big deal at all to me). Ended up taking half of my schnitzel home, the portions were super generous. We got a Beaver cookie and two of the chocolate balls to take home...just as amazing as dinner. We have already decided we're going back next weekend (I'm thinkin' meatballs and pierogies) and I have a feeling we will be there a lot in the future...this place is awesome! Anyone who complains about the wait time...maybe it's just me but I'd rather wait a half hour for quality food than the alternative. This isn't fast food...go to McDonald's if you only have five minutes to wolf down something.

Oh hey, another vet review from the crazy dog lady.  While I LOVED Lucy's vet and still love them and will utilize them for evening or weekend issues when North Kenilworth is closed, I signed Lucy up for United Pet Care since I got a sweet deal through work, and her vet was not on their list of providers. I narrowed down the three closest vets to my house that were on the list, and North Kenilworth had the best reviews so I made an appointment.  Recently one of Lucy's litter mates had to be put down due to a very sudden illness and of course I'm paranoid and wanted Lucy checked out in case it was something genetic. I honestly went in not expecting what we would discuss, since I just scheduled a general checkup. We saw Dr. Hansen and I believe the vet tech's name was Asia (I am TERRIBLE with names so I am sorry if that is my bad memory lying). They were absolutely great and made Lucy comfortable in the room and when they had to take her to the back area of the office. We went over the issue and possible testing they may do after they review her recent test results from the other vet, and they also discussed her need for surgery for another condition, which her other vet had also suggested, and gave me an estimate for the cost of the surgery (with my UPC discount included, which was nice). They knew she was UTD on vaccines, so they didn't push on those, just asked about heartworm testing and meds (which she was admittedly behind on) and also suggested another medication to help until her surgery. Completed her HW test and sent us home with the chews and medication. Very helpful and insightful regarding her care, and Dr. Hansen asked very specific questions about Lucy and I could tell she has a way with dogs...hard to explain, but just very intuitive. Glad I chose this vet from this list, happy to know my furchild is in good hands!

This place is solid. The crazy thing is you forget when you walk in that it used to be a Wendy's. I work nearby and often stop in for a lunch special to-go. The staff is always friendly, have you sit at the bar while you wait and offer the cucumber water while they prepare your food. I am a creature of habit and almost always get the classic (yellow) curry with tofu, but occasionally I'll live dangerously (haha) and get the sweet & sour Thai style (sooo good, the sauce is so tasty and I love that it has cucumbers in it) or the spicy noodle. They get your food out quickly and, more importantly, it always tastes awesome. Love this place!

I happened to find out about this place because a favorite local band of mine was having a release party show at the venue right after it opened. I didn't make that show, but was familiar with the name of the venue the second time that band played, and showed up not knowing what to expect.  I love the ambiance of this place. You get to really see the band up close and personal, and the sound is phenom. The environment is great for local bands and there isn't a bad spot in the place.  Drinks were awesome, and the food was fantastic (and not as expensive as I had anticipated. Hell, I hadn't anticipated food, period, given it was a music venue). But of course the food would be great, considering the kitchen is overseen by Chris Bianco, who is responsible for the masterpiece that is Pizzeria Bianco.  Can't say enough good stuff about this place!!!

My dad suggested this place for brunch yesterday (again, my dad catching onto awesome local places before I do...oh well). I just wanted a Bloody Mary, so I wasn't really sure what to expect as far as their brunch menu. We sat down under a huge tree on the patio and my dad mentioned that service is usually kind of slow, but the food is worth it. I don't know if they were just faster than usual this day or if my dad and I's definitions of "slow" differ, but our server was attentive and our drinks and food came out pretty quickly. My parents & I ordered our Bloodys - spicy for my dad and regular for my mother and I. They were delicious - I am pretty picky when it comes to Bloodys and they didn't disappoint. I was impressed with the food - I ordered the crab cake eggs Benny, and the fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and sauce were all just as delicious as the main dish. My boyfriend ordered some kind of breakfast flatbread, which looked more like a pizza when it came out and was much bigger than we expected (you could easily split it between two people). I tried some of the crust and it was awesome. We will definitely be back, especially considering that the patio is dog-friendly. The only weird thing about our brunch was the water (go figure). Every once in a while in Phoenix, you go somewhere and every time you take a sip of water, there is some horrible smell - I can't figure out if it's the Phoenix water or the way the restaurants wash their dishes or what. I just ended up ditching the water and sticking to my booze, so it worked out okay. ;)

I'm not usually a huge Southern Indian food fan (I prefer the Northern fare), but my mum has taken me to pretty much every Indian restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and she wanted to try this one, so my brother and I tagged along (who says no to free Indian food? Who?). Food was awesome! Mum started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was very spicy but really good, and my brother and I just ordered an extra side of bread (we always go with traditional garlic naan and we ordered an aloo peas paratha as well, which was very good). Mum had a dosai, which she is really fond of, for the life of me I cannot remember what my brother ordered, and I had the aloo mutter, which was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful - a little too helpful, as he asked about the spice level we'd like (I said very low, as I know how spicy some places can get) and when Mum said an 8 out of 10 he replied, "No, for you, a 3." He was mostly joking but she was insisting she wanted it very hot and he kept trying to navigate her down. He probably saw her as a delusional white woman who would start crying the second she started eating and realized how hot it really was, but she grew up in India and ate nothing but Indian food in London in college, so she (unlike my pathetic palette) can handle some CRAZY spicy food, and he eventually gave up trying to change her mind. We had a really great dinner, and it was nice to see that they actually have a lot of Indian customers, which usually points to some authentic and delicious food. Will definitely be back, this place changed my mind about Southern Indian cuisine!

Of course I came to Las Vegas without a plan of attack re: hair/makeup until the day of the wedding I was attending. Whoops. I looked around online and after refusing to pay $140 or more for a blowout or styling I called Dollheads at about 11 AM Saturday hoping and praying they would have an appointment for early afternoon. They didn't. The receptionist offered to take my name and number and call me if there was a cancellation - I figured why not, even though there's a snowball's chance in hell of that happening. Abysmal images of me doing my own hair started flashing through my mind (I am completely useless with straightening irons, curling irons, clothes irons...basically any type of iron) but I got ready to go get my makeup done and figured I'd just try to avoid having my picture taken as much as possible that night. I got a call a couple hours later, letting me know there was a cancellation and could I make a 4 PM appointment? Um, do fat kids love cake? Best part - I realized the salon was located in the Miracle Mile shops, which connect to Planet Hollywood, where I had to be at 6 PM for said wedding. I showed up after my makeup was done and Joseph took amazinggg care of me! Heavenly scalp massage during my shampoo, suggested different styles for the wedding, and my hair looked BEAUTIFUL and perfectly curly when I left. The curls are still about 75% intact the next day, despite a crazy Vegas wedding night. The price was reasonable, my hair looked fantastic, and I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in LV!

We just moved to the area, and the other day I came home to a surprise from my boyfriend - a box of cupcakes from Gigi's down the road. I had seen the bakery frequently while driving but had figured we were in the middle of moving and I'd have time to feed my out-of-control cupcake habit later. I tried a bite of all three of the varieties he brought home and was in LOVE! My favorite: the peanut butter cup. Oh my goodness. The chocolate cupcake is divine (and I don't usually like chocolate cake of any sort), and the frosting was heavenlyyy. Second favorite: blackberry cobbler. Real blackberry taste and again, delicious frosting. The third was a pumpkin white chocolate, which was also delicious, I just think I'm pumpkin'd out, it being October and all. The only bad thing about these cupcakes is you can't eat a whole bit at once with frosting and cake because they are so big! I'm so glad that I have a cupcake place nearby that has so many interesting options (sweet potato pie and coconut macaroon are next on our list!) and such yummy cupcakes!

Having this place right down the road is going to be a sincere issue...  I had to update, because we have now tried additional flavors and they have all been amazing! I had the famed Canadian Maple Bacon and it did not disappoint. The bacon's texture was a LITTLE off, but the overall cupcake made up for it. The frosting on this one is divineee. Also had the Wedding Cake - perfect, light, vanilla-y amazingness, the coconut macaroon (need I even say more? YUM!), and the grasshopper (not a huge mint fan, but this was also awesome!). I am officially addicted to this place...dammit!

I have pretty much accepted that I am less cool than my 50-something year old dad and have to get restaurant recommendations from him on the regular. Before something is on Yelp, he somehow knows about it. This was the case with Louisiana Fried Chicken.  I wanted something different for lunch a couple weeks ago (I work in the Arcadia area and one can only eat Chipotle so many days a week), and I remembered my dad had mentioned this place a while back and said it was really good. I drove out to find it and could not. (This is not a dig at their sign placement, location, etc. I am just terrible at finding places when I'm driving.) After getting something crappy and disappointing for lunch, I talked to a coworker who had been there and he told me exactly where to find it (next to Panda Express). I resolved to get me some fried chicken the next day.  I didn't order ahead, just walked in. The girl up front was super friendly and I ordered the breast and wing, with mac and cheese and dirty rice. I must have had a premonition about how good it would be if I ordered mac and cheese, because I am not a mac and cheese fan unless it's made a VERY specific way, and usually fried chicken/soul food places have the only mac and cheese I love. So, I waited for my food, they called my number about 15 minutes later, friendly kitchen guy asked if I wanted hot sauce (not even a hot sauce fan and I said yes), and I was on my way.  I got back to my office and the chicken was REALLY tasty. Perfectly crunchy on the outside and the meat was juicy. Dipped it in the hot sauce and it was delish. The mac and cheese was BOMB. Next time I'll just get one piece of chicken and a tub of mac and cheese. (Public fat kid confession.) Dirty rice was also really good (I stirred in some of the leftover hot sauce...oh yeah. Do it). Overall, a really great experience! Will definitely be back.

I am officially a Stand junkie. It only took one time.  I found The Stand on Yelp a while back, and when we tried to go they were closed for a holiday party (nooooo!) so we had to ignore our burger cravings and go get hot wings (well, that actually wasn't so bad). Last night my boyfriend REALLY wanted a burger and insisted we go.  I had visited their website and figured there was no way the burger was going to look like it did on the website...I was wrong. But, I get ahead of myself. We walked in and ALL the staff were super nice. We ordered two Standards with cheese, drinks, and BF got fries (with their special sauce on the side). I totally forgot about their street corn and am cursing myself for not asking about it (but it's seasonal so maybe I'll have to wait anyway). BF got the grilled jalapeños on his burger, I didn't.  HOLY MOLY. They brought our burgers out and they were gone before I could even snap a picture. They DID look just as awesome as they did on their website. When does that ever happen? The beef cuts combination they use for the burger (short rib, chuck, brisket? I think that's right) makes it the best burger ever. The bun was awesome, the pickles were perfect (not the crappy kind you get in a jar, like most places throw on theirs). Overall, it's a super simple, not fancy burger that is perfection. The fries were a little crispy for my taste but the sauce that came with them was awesome.  The combination of the awesome food, super reasonable prices considering how great the food is, and beyond-nice staff means this will be one of our new go-to places.
