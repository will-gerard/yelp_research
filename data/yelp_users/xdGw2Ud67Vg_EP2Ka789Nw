I get their avocado burger with no lettuce every time I'm in the neighborhood. The bread on these burgers totally makes them. Tons of avocados. Very tasty! The drive thru service can be a little less than friendly, but as long as they give me my burger, I'm happy! I always use my debit card, but the order has to be greater than $5.

We went in Friday evening to celebrate Mother's Day a bit early as I work Sunday. The service was slow and inattentive and the food was mediocre, especially considering the price point. Our server was nice, it seemed like the rest of her section was somewhere we couldn't see from where we were sitting because the only time we saw her was when she popped her head around the corner. I just didn't get a warm fuzzy from this place and probably won't be back. The good thing? The siracha honey sauce for the coconut shrimp was amazing.

Stopped in for breakfast with a friend. Eggs cooked perfectly and bran muffin was hot and delicious. Service fast and friendly. Very nice experience.

Went back today. Their breakfast menu has changed a lot recently. The Santa Fe Omelette is back! Today I had lemon poppyseed pancakes with strawberry rhubarb butter, corned beef hash (it's St. Patty's day!), and eggs. The pancakes were really good, and the hash was cooked to perfection! Ines was pleasant and stayed on top of our drinks. Love seeing the hostess help out the server with drink refills when she wasn't busy up front. Teamwork is good! Great meal!

I've been here twice and had lovely experiences both times. Yesterday, my friend and I were in the area, and I suggested Heidi's. The line was long, but the employees were working fast. The sourdough bread, cut fresh for my sandwich, was still slightly warm from the oven. I added avocado (generous portion for only 50 cents) to my chicken salad sandwich. It was divine, and far more than I could finish, so I have my lunch for today as well!  Total cost with a drink was $9 and change... Not unreasonable at all. Employees were friendly and while the service was a bit slow, I'm convinced that good food takes time, so I'll wait and not get worked up over it. I will be going back to Heidi's every time I'm in the neighborhood!

I love this place. As a native of Louisiana, I find my self craving a taste of home from time to time. The food is consistently delicious. I highly recommend the boudin balls with Cajun tarter sauce and dunkin' catfish. The shrimp po-boy is excellent, as is the gumbo. I used to go when it was more self serve for drinks, but they've renovated a couple of times over the past year and have table service, at least on busy days. I typically call in my order and either bring it home or eat it there. One of the best things about this place is the friendly, kind people who own/work at this restaurant. I'm so happy to find a taste of home so close to where I live now.

My favorite place for shrimp tacos and elote. I got my tacos to go today. When I called in my order it was taken in a friendly, efficient and professional manner. My food was ready for me when I arrived 10 minutes later and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. The tacos were superb, as usual!

Sadly, Gallo Blanco is no longer open due to a conflict between the Clarendon Hotel and the owners of the restaurant. The restaurant that has replaced it is poorly staffed and serves mediocre food. Don't bother.

Had a great experience at this location. Very helpful staff, and the crab wontons are always delicious. I wasn't so fond of the Asian chop salad, tho. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5. Food was fast and yummy.

I was back in to see Dr. Maitra this morning. The scheduler squeezed me in despite their tight schedule. The staff was friendly and efficient, as they almost always are. My wait was less than 10 minutes in the lobby and about the same in the exam room. Dr Maitra performed a thorough exam, diagnosed my problem and gave me strategies for dealing with it. I've been going there for the last decade and I'm still happy. :)

I'm so disappointed in this office that after being a patient here for a decade I am shopping for a new PCP. They desperately need to replace their PA. No same day appointments are available. I called to see if they could see my daughter for an infection and was told to go to urgent care. Scheduling is a month and a half out. This practice built up a clientele for 2-3 providers and now only has 1. Since I cannot receive the care I need from this office in a timely manner, I'm forced to look elsewhere.

We stepped in at 5pm on a Friday evening. The place was busy, but not packed. We were immediately greeted and seated. The ambiance is loud, it's true, and that is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. The music, yelling and clapping grated on my nerves a bit. Nevertheless, we told our server, Desaray, that we were in a hurry. She had us in and out in 35 minutes including an appetizer! My steak was cooked perfectly medium, my daughter loved her pork chop, and my husband raved about the pulled pork. Despite the rowdy atmosphere, we enjoyed our meal and were impressed by our server. Well done.

Once again, we had an almost thoroughly enjoyable meal here. We were greeted and seated immediately by a friendly hostess. It took a couple of minutes for our server, Kyle, to greet us, which was fine because I was waiting for my husband to come in from parking the car. Our orders were taken with a minimum of up selling. Tea glasses were filled before they were empty and the food was delivered within 15 minutes. Our steaks were juicy, and my baked sweet potato was amazing. My only complaint is the music. I get that this isn't an upscale setting, but it's still a family restaurant. If the music is too loud to talk over, then it's too loud.

I was a regular when this was Paradise Bakery. The new decor is sleek and clean, and as far as I am concerned, much more comfortable. Not thrilled with the availability of plug ins for my laptop, or the fact that I had to crawl on the floor to plug it in once I found one. The food was the same as before. Loved the DIY kiosks. My issue is with service, which is not terribly friendly, and, based on previous reviews, can be awful. Figure it out, Panera.
