Wow! What a wonderful car shopping experience!  I went in this past weekend to purchase a CLA 250. Was greeted right away and introduced to Lou Gordon! This was the best car shopping experience I have ever had. He was funny, professional, and most importantly honest and humble. He made me feel right at ease and knew that my time was valuable so he took care of everything as quick and efficiently as possible. This was my first Benz purchase and I hope Lou stays around for my next car purchase. I consider him family and he is definitely a major asset to Schumacher Mercedes. The service he provides is what makes people keep coming back.

From the moment I walked in, Taylor and Kat were extremely inviting and friendly!!!! Taylor was extremely confident, sharp, and personable. "Service is black and white, hospitality is color," I found a hostess that left not only a good impression, but a lasting impression. She is absolutely likable with spark. Compassion, enthusiasm, team player, and polished are just a few of the many attributes that come to mind when it comes to Taylor and Kat. She is truly a valuable asset to this restaurant and I will continue to be a repeat customer and spread the word about this place as long as she continues to work here. Best hire ever!

I called Kent to do a job for me. Left him a voicemail and he never got back to me. After calling him a third time, he finally answered and asked him if he can do some jobs around the house. Before understanding what work needed to be done, he said he only did kitchen and bathrooms and once I told him where I lived he said that my location is outside of his work area and that he couldn't help me! Lol I'm in Phoenix so not like I'm really far away...

Despite Jason being in the hospital the night prior, he went above and beyond to make things right!!!!! I understand that he was not available at 7 AM like planned but life happens. I am happy that Jason is okay and he still showed up the day after he was sick to take care of my large move. He was courteous, professional, had a good sense of humor and exceeded expectations to make sure as a customer I was fully satisfied! I appreciate the work you did Jason and your attention to detail. I will call you for all my future needs!
