I had an excellent experience at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Pool area and bar are awesome. The weather was perfect for swimming. We had fun ordering room service. The internet in the rooms is sucks. We were there for a convention and the hotel took great care of us. Breakfast buffets in the morning and parties with drinks and food every night. It happened to be our anniversary and they did a lot to make it special. They sent chocolates and sparkling wine to the room, comped some of our meals and drinks, it was really nice.   The room was pretty comfortable, the AC could have been colder and there's no refrigerator. There was a nice throw that my wife enjoyed wrapping up in. We asked for a north facing room to keep us out of the sun and they did that for us. We had lovely shade all day.   The property is pretty cool. The architecture is neat, there's lots of little surprises. I saw a handful of cool animals including a coyote, some kind of wildcat, hawks, hummingbirds, baby jackrabbits, and an owl. There's a boat you can take to the casino and the Wild West attractions, but I didn't get to try it. It looks fun.  I would absolutely come back here given to opportunity. It's a beautiful resort and the people are the best! Shout out to William at the front desk and Ruth at the pool bar for being goddamn awesome! Four stars!

This place is a wasteland. Zombie mall shambling forward for absolutely no reason whatsoever. The only redeeming feature of the surrounding area is an in and Out Burger.  It looks to be about 75% vacant.  This entire area needs to be reworked. Avoid this mall. It will give you the sads.

We went for the Sunday brunch buffet and found it to be delicious. Everything you would look for at a breakfast buffet in a hotel. Fresh squeezed juices, eggs cooked to order, real maple syrup for the pancakes, awesome chorizo sausage gravy, thick slices of bacon, mountains of fresh fruit and baskets of croissants and muffins. It was our anniversary during our visit and they comped one our meals on this visit. Worth going if you're staying at the hotel, food is great. We got a really cozy booth in the middle of the room. Service was fine. Coffee was good. Carol C. got a USA Today which she enjoyed a lot. What else can you ask? Nice work Ko'sin.

This In N Out Burger is the best thing about this rather depressing part of Phoenix. I stayed in the area for two nights solely based on the proximity to an In N Out Burger.   The place is spotlessly clean, and everyone is extremely friendly. We ordered cheeseburgers and fries and chocolate shakes. Everything was great, I was stuffed. It's always fun to eat fast food you can't get at home. A great first time visit!
