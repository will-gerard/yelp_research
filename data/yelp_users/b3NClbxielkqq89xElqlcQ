Just as many other locals have said, this is one of the best if not the best in the valley for Dim Sum. Having had Dim Sum in many major cities, I don't want to compare them with this place since it simply isn't fair.  This is as authentic as you can get in Phoenix. Judging by how packed this place gets, I would say many people agree. Basic rule of thumb is that if there is a crowd of Asian people waiting outside in the heat to get a table, chances are the place is good and pretty darn authentic. Fyi, be prepared to wait and listen carefully for your ticket number.  I can't begin to describe the dishes as I don't know how to translate them exactly. Dim sum is as much as an experience as it is the food, especially for people new to it. If you're adventurous, just pick whatever looks good to you. If you're more risk-averse, hopefully you know a dim sum chaperon to serve as your culinary sherpa. In case that you don't have a guide, then just stick to anything that looks like a dumpling or bun for starters. Eventually, the deliciousness will drive out the fear of the unknown and you'll be more willing to try other dishes.  Whenever I'm jonesin' for some dim sum in Phoenix, this is the place.

Ok. A full star is generous but this site only allows 1 star increments. I've been to this place 3 times, hoping that service will either improve or balance out. I like to support "mom and pop" places and local restaurants which is why I gave it several opportunities to make up for poor service. But to my disappointment, this is the last straw. I show up for a bite to eat with a friend around 9pm on a Monday night which is typically the slowest night of the week for most restaurants. As soon as we received our menus we were already expected to give our order. After asking for a few more minutes to decide, the waitress comes back in less than a minute, urging us to make a decision. Strike 1. Next after ordering our food, we receive our orders in a reasonable amount of time. By now it's about 9:15. The food is mediocre as usual but that can be forgiven to a certain degree. While I'm still eating the last few bites of my food, the waitress is tugging at my plate to take it away. I had to stop her and tell her that I wasn't quite finished. Strike 2. She came back a couple of minutes later dropped off the check and packed the few leftovers. By now it's around 9:30. My friend and I were in the middle of a conversation when she rudely interrupted to ask to close the check. I glanced at my watch to be mindful of the time they close which was 10pm...it was 9:35. Strike 3. At this point, enough is enough. I asked for a manager to let her know of the poor service and I was suddenly surrounded by the remaining wait staff which stood there waiting for me to act crazy or something. After politely speaking my dissatisfaction, my friend and I left vowing never to return and encourage others to do the same. In this economic climate, you would think that frequent customers would save establishments like this. However, to create frequent customers, they would have to be encouraged to come back!! I am amazed how this place stays in business. Mediocre food (at best), rather high prices, and poor service. If you want to pour money into local businesses, pour it somewhere else because this establishment could care less.

First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...  A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.  9/4/2010 My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying.   For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black "forbidden" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!  This is where it gets ugly... As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect??  He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left. Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!!  The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying "May I say 'Sorry' to you?" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.  Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!

I passed by this place many times never giving it a chance because it looked like a run-down place taken over by new owners. Boy was I wrong. I've been missing out! This place has great food for the price without question. Never mind the building or decor. The food portions are generous and the food itself is very near authentic cuisine. It's one of those secret places that few people know about. You can waste your money on all the other Thai places that would rather focus on decor or presentation, but if you want real Thai for real value, this is the place to go. On top of all that, the service is great! They're attentive, courteous, knowledgeable about the food, and very friendly. Support local businesses!  Btw, for those that live near the light rail, it's only a short ride away.

I passed by this place several times but never walked in because I usually eat before I head downtown. As most people in Phoenix know, it can be challenging to find an open restaurant  in downtown Phoenix at times. However, one day, I had decided to give it a shot since it was one of the few restaurants open on a Sunday afternoon. The simple fact that it was open on a Sunday afternoon when other surrounding restaurants were closed, is a definite plus!! I frequent Thai restaurants in many cities across the country and Arizona is one of those places that struggles in quality. However, this place is actually quite good in comparison to many of the top Thai restaurants in larger cities. Plus, its price is just right if not a bargain considering the portion they provide. They're able to achieve just the right  taste for their standard fare (pad thai, pad see-eiw, satay, etc.) as well as their pan-asian fare (vermicelli soups, curry, etc.). The service was also very good with attentive, smiling wait staff. I will definitely be back and want to try more of their specials as well as more of their pan-asian items. They are now my downtown weekend spot since the food is great, items are reasonably priced, wait staff is friendly and attentive, and place is actually open! Please keep up the great work Thai Elephant!

Don't believe what you read about the famous Phoenician Sunday Brunch. Just another disappointment to the already overrated restaurant scene in or near the Scottsdale area. I had guests from out of town and decided to take them to the Sunday Brunch since I've heard so much hype about it from local reviewers. I, myself, have never been there but I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out while entertaining guests. I mean, it's the prestigious Phoenician, so what could go wrong.  The Brunch is $45 per person, so you can only imagine what a grand display they would have. I mean, the Wynn in Las Vegas charges around the same and they have an amazing and elegant display of cuisines. At the Phoenician Brunch, the breakfast buffet portion of the brunch is just a hair better than the Holiday Inn complimentary breakfast (which is free by the way). They had custom made omelettes, cereal, assorted pastries, and standard breakfast fare (bacon, potatoes, eggs, and fruit). But that's it. That's all the breakfast buffet offered. The lunch portion is a 3 course menu affair. It consisted of an appetizer, main course, and dessert. The appetizers offered sounded good but were not prepared very well. The main courses were decent but not for the price you pay. The desserts come out in a tower for the entire table to pick off of. They, too, were decent but not for the price you pay. The only thing that the Phoenician lived up to its reputation is the service. It was exceptional and to the standard of the hotel. However, I wasn't paying for service. I wanted to pay for a high-end, quality brunch. So if you just want to be treated like royalty (and pay like royalty) yet served less than royal food, this is the place for you. As for me, I can wait to hit up Vegas again. More value for my money out there especially in these economic times.

As I am a supporter of downtown Phoenix and hope that Cityscape thrives, I decided to have lunch here with girlfriends. I wasn't sure what to expect but judging by the name of the restaurant, I thought this would be mainly a steakhouse. I was totally wrong. I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. This is the type of place that downtown Phoenix needs. It's contemporary American cuisine at its finest. The decor is modern and hip without being terribly ostentatious. The vibe reminded me of Chicago and NYC. It has a sophistication without pretension feel.  I had the Crab Cake Louie salad which I felt was exquisite. Everything tasted fresh without that fishy taste like crab cakes served in other places, nor was it overly breaded. The vegetables were crisp and the dressing was sweet, light, and spicy. I wanted to try more dishes but I practically licked my plate clean. My girlfriends were also enamored by this place and wanted to stay later but we all just agreed that we'll be back for Happy Hour and dinner. I would have given this place 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays.
