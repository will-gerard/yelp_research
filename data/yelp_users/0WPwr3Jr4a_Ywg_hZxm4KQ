Great place for good food during HH! I invited my picky friends here and they loved the food! Yes yes yes, they have an "enlighted" delish menu. BIG thumbs up for that. Menu is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory? super long w/so many choices. We had the shrimp lettuce wraps on the patio and Chicken ala fresca with veggies (minus rice).  It was prepared exactly as asked. One friend had the burger grill which looked super yummy...They even have a "light" version of the draft for you beer consumers ;) Overall? Dont let the name fool you, this place is good for a really nice, clean, healthy, fun and chilaxin time. Enjoy!

I would say the only thing good about San Marin is that it is in the perfect area in Old Town. They also look nice from afar.  Too be quite honest I would never recommend this place to anyone professional looking to get a nice place.  The management staff is so nice and accommodating before you sign the lease. 1. When I first saw the apartment they said there was an office building behind me, which was a lie! It was a Bar to my surprise! I couldn't sleep during the week due to the loud noise.  2. Termites and Scorpions? Yes, they had to spray my place 2 times in the nine months I lived there. I was really disappointed. 3. When my lease was up they increased the rent over $100/month to renew for a small one bedroom, which would have cost me over $1000 for less than 800 sf of living space. 4. The thing that annoying me most, was all my $225 'refundable' deposit was not returned. My latch on my balcony screen was broken when i moved in and I requested them to fix it 3 times but the maintenance guy just came and took a peak each time and stated they had to order parts. 5. In addition to taking my deposit, they charged me to clean the carpet again, which I had done, and paid $104 for already. I gave them my carpet cleaning receipt and they said it was too soapy so they had to clean again? What does that have to do with me, Im not the Carpet Cleaners? I finally had to call their headquarters in Texas to eliminate the said $75 additional charges they wanted me to pay for cleaning. If you don't mind going through all this, I would say this is the right place for you! Good luck. :)

So serene... eat an entree like the Beef short ribs. Appetizers are small enough for only one person. You also need to take a few seniors with you to fit in the crowd... :)

I am very picky about my clothes and who is to clean them. My tailor recommended these cleaners so I said I would give them a shot. After reading yelp reviews I get skeptical when one give too high or too low of stars, so I tried them out. Honestly I'm impressed it was very fairly priced and my clothes look as they were brand new off the rack! My winter wool jacket is like new. I will visit again very soon! Thank you for that great surprise! Not all you read on here is fair, guess I had to see for myself.

Great, Simple, Friendly, Great service. Everything you want in a normal restaurant where you can order 'take out' with ease. I love the service. I ordered a Pad Thai extra spicy. Usually most places dont make it hot enough. The server asked me twice how i want it prepared, it was amazing and blazing. thank you I will come again next month when I get to eat pasta again...

Love hanging out here on the wknd! Its always crowded, reminds me of Ferndale or Royal Oak crowds back home in Michigan. Great vibe, for the white outdoor patio and the loud music gives off a Miami-South Beach theme. Unfortunately, the dirty martinis are a hit or miss. The food isn't something you want to eat prior to a night on the town (wknd). It's ok as far as food or drinks go, but it's a classier crowd then the normal El Hefe OT College Bar crowd-thank goodness! Sooooo that is what keeps me coming back. A must try at least once, and I love the great location!

I think this is my new place to go for real good food. Made to order and very fresh. It's hard to find good food and service nowadays. Thanks for actually making me leave a restaurant with mouth watering tingling aftertaste...   ha :)

Well if anyone deserves ZERO STARS HERE WE ARE!  I have been here twice and had ok meals. This time today was my worst dining experience ever. I ordered an omelette and out comes the server with our food and he was the one who noticed a hair on it. Sent back only to return with another pretty looking omelette with a Hair on top!!! I was so appalled. Can you imagine this happening twice ? My friends were about done with their food when I gave then a 3rd chance. This time we were good but my toast was full of butter which isn't what I ordered. Anyway. They were nice to take it off the bill and my fresh food was good even though everyone else on my table was done eating and just watching me. What awful Luck... I still see that hair in my visual mind. Never coming back here again. Sorry for the bad review but it was a horrid experience.

2nd Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl game, and I will be there again next year... Would have been even better if my Wolverines had one! 3rd row is great, seems as if any seat in this small stadium is a good one.

One of the best steakhouses in Scottsdale, AZ. I go here when I have people visiting from out of town, birthdays, or a girls night out :).  My steak is always prepared perfectly well and butterflied to perfection. YUMMY?!?!?!!!! Can you say: "Warm Butter CAKE"? Well take a bite and you will just say WOW! I don't care for sweets but this is a must try! When ordering sides make sure you ask for light oil or butter, they soak in in the dishes but that is what makes it soooooooooooo good. Make sure you drink a lot of H20 for the sodium in the food will guarantee to get you swelling (in a good way) especially if you mix your food with a Xtra DIRTY Martini + Extra Olives.  If you are visiting or just live in AZ, this restaurant is a must-have on your BUCKET LIST.  Bon Appetite & Cheers!

Don't eat here the chicken smells so bad and they don't even use romaine lettuce in their salad. Glass of Cabernet was from an open bottle tasted so flat! And even when we complained they didn't offer ANYTHING else... $20 salad is better at Mastro's

When you ask for HOT it means hot. Not take it home and add more hot sauce and sriracha... WTH?

Omg can you say selection? Any type of hair imaginable. Clip in, I-tip, tracks, wigs. I was in hair heaven. They even have the proper accessories for each type of hair. Thank you for saving me before my big event on a bad hair day that turned out Fab! Woohoo! Would have been 5 stars but they charge a leg with that arm! Mommy!

Worst yogurt in the state of AZ. Sorry guys, but I eat yogurt maybe twice a year and you ruined it for me. Honestly the employees were super sweet and ready to help...but they should be helping make these flavorzzz. What? Yes very monotonous! The vanilla bean and cheesecake and chocolate tasted the exact same. I'm not one to complain but can we get our $8 back?  Please review your ingredients or recipes and make sure you have fresh yogurt... Maybe it's old? I dont know, that could be the reason all your 10+ flavors taste the same?

I went for a Lymphatic Massage, and the owner Marie took care of me. She was so nice and informative. I felt relaxed and calm with the lovely surroundings and great scent of her "retreat". The music was perfect (which can affect a massage dramatically). I made an appointment for my next massage before I left. That would show how much they impressed me with their experience and service.  Merci Beacoup!

I recently changed my LARGE bank to US Bank, which was close to my home and seemed to be in many grocery stores when I go shopping. I was a bit skeptical about joining forces with a smaller bank. Since I was new to Arizona, I only knew the top 2 or 3 big wigs out there. They explained everything to me in detail. I went home to sleep on it.   After doing research I found out they were 5th in the country for banking and 3rd for mortgages. Hey I felt more confidence, so I decided to go back and tranfer my accounts. Well I didn't realize how easy it was to transition. They treated me as if I have been a customer for years (shocking), while my original bank always made me feel I was going to commit a crime to take my own money out.   So I get my debit card and lost the pin, of course who waits for that to come in the mail? I went into the local branch and the banker was so pleasant. She was more than helpful also to come outside with me around the building and show me how to reset my pin and all!  A+ for customer service. When I buy a home I'm going to them for my lending needs as well. Thanks for the peace of mind, since I have so many other things to worry about.

I like that this outlet mall had a live band- even though they were playing Country! Haha. Fascinating that they had Nike, Puma, Adidas, and many other shoe stores! More than one selection was fun! Don't forget to bring your fitbit because you will be walking... Nothing major different from other so called premium outlets, but I definitely will visit again soon! Happy Shopping
