They make everything to order and the ingredients are fresh, but I don't know if the food was sitting out for a while or if they don't cook it piping-hot, because most of the meal came out lukewarm.  The Italian beef with provolone was just ok, nothing special - maybe a tad better than the version served at Portillo's.  The Centurion calzone was tasty - I liked the mix of ingredients (mozzarella, roasted peppers, Kalamata olives, sopressata, basil, and tomato), but again, I wish that it came out a little hotter, with the cheese a little more melted.  The calzone is pretty large, and the leftovers tasted better heated up the next day.  There are about 15 or so tables that fit 2-3 people each, and a line quickly forms during peak lunch hours.  It's hard for groups bigger than 3 people to really sit together, because most of the tables are small and seat only two.  You're also basically sitting and eating among grocery shelves.    I'd say that the marinara sauce was the best component of the meal, even though it (along with the sausages) also came out lukewarm.  But overall the food was not memorable or worth the drive.  And since I can buy San Marzano tomatoes at more and more places now, I don't think I will be coming back here.

I love the menu, I love the presentation, I love the feel of the restaurant, and I love the happy hour prices.  The hotel and restaurant has a trendy, retro, modern, Crate&Barrel color look to it.  All of their tacos are fresh and delicious, especially the pork belly when it's available.  The one exception was the carne asada, which was tender and cooked well but tasted a little off, as if it was seasoned incorrectly or something.  The horchata was decent.  I was impressed by the guacamole and the housemade salsas, and that huge grilled corn is awesome too. The staff even accommodated a dairy allergy and grilled one of the corns without the cojita cheese for us.   I'm telling you - everything is incredible, and during happy hour it feels like we're robbing the place clean!  Servers are great and attentive too, and they really try to take care of you.  You have to bring an out-of-towner here to eat, cause there really aren't too many places like this.  It's just a fun, beautiful spot to come and grab a bite, and everyone there is so pleasant and attentive.  Gotta try their breakfast items next time I'm there.

The hype was unmet, along with the expectations of juicy and flavorful fried chicken.  For the price I paid I was looking forward to at least better-than-average waffles and chicken, but neither hit the spot.  The chicken was dry, had a little too much breading, and needed more seasoning/spices.  The waffles were also dry, and no amount of syrup or butter helped.  I love fried chicken, skin and all, and to quote David Chang, "I could eat the worst fried chicken and love it," but I just wasn't impressed here.  (1) The space itself was clean, spacious, and bright, (2) our server was friendly, (3) the Kool-Aid was refreshing, and (4) the mason jars in which the drinks are served were cool, but (5) as for the food itself - not worth it.

Solid pho, and I don't even have to add the disclaimer  "..it's good for Phoenix."  Subconsciously (or sometimes out loud) I'm usually comparing the quality of Phoenix restaurants to their counterparts in the LA area - I do this for burgers, ramen, carne asada, boba, whatever - and the food in question always comes up short.   But with Pho Than, the soup is not quite, but pretty close to, the kind of pho that you can find in LA.  Trust me, I've tried the pho numerous times at other valley restaurants - Pho Viet, Angelina's, Maxim, and especially Pho Avina (which is pretty good, but comes in a distant second to Pho Than), and the rich, aromatic, and greasy (in a delicious way) broth of Pho Than comes out on top.  And the price can't be beat either.  Two large bowls, 2-3 orders of egg rolls, a combo fried rice, and a Vietnamese iced coffee or two will all come in under $30, easy.  I've tried many of their broken rice dishes and chef specialties, such as the sizzling filet mignon and pork chop, but the value and flavor of the pho cannot be beat.    Service is nonexistent, and if you're not familiar with Asian waitstaff you might interpret the attitude/demeanor of the servers as rudeness or apathy, but don't let that dissuade you from trying this place out.  Don't let the location or exterior dissuade you either.

The pan roast is one of the best dishes in all of Phoenix.  Whether you order the combo, crawfish, or shrimp, each dish is packed with seafood and satisfies the belly like nothing else.  You still remember that you're eating in a casino, 'cause you really can't drown out the sounds from the slot machines or stop smelling the cigarette smoke wafting your way from all angles, but it doesn't matter, because the food is JUST THAT GOOD.  If you're sitting at one of the small tables away from the bar, it's also hard to ignore the mass of people that are constantly walking by you, since you're right off the casino floor, but don't let that deter you from eating here either.  The food is JUST THAT GOOD!  If you like okra, then you'll love the gumbo, which is also packed with fresh seafood-y goodness and okra-y sliminess.  The shrimp boil is not bad, and would be good on its own, but not when compared to any of the pan roast dishes.  The broth is a little too thin for my taste.  The chowders are excellent, as is the Caesar salad.    But the thing that ties the whole thing together is their bread, which is kind of toasty and soft and chewy all at the same time, and which is perfect for extracting every last bite of sauce and crab bits from the last remnants of your pan roast.  Great bread + great butter + great pan roast = awesome meal every time.  And at only $12 for lunch, or $20 for dinner (for double the portion), I personally think that this meal is a steal.    Sit at the bar and watch the whole cooking process take place, and prepare to be amazed.

Got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  Pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  Food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).  The waitstaff would just stand and wait for the food to be ready.  It could have been more efficient (and thus quicker), but maybe they were limited by the size of the kitchen.  Oh well...  The ramen itself was just okay, with average-tasting broth and average noodles.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the wavy noodles, and some pork belly bowls and fried rice for the kids.  Not bad overall, and service was good, but I prefer Fukumimi Ramen to this place.  But mad props to that multi-tasking cook, he sure was fun to watch!

One star.  The brisket was overly fatty and tough, and the 2 ribs were chewy and over-sauced.  I like fat on my meat, but not to the point where there's so little meat that all I'm chewing and swallowing is fat.  It was very unpleasant.  The cornbread muffin was not moist at all and landed on the table from the server's hands with a rock-like thud.   I've had better macaroni salad at AJ's.  There was not one redeeming quality to the meal.  My friends' pork sandwiches were tasteless also, with semi-cold buns and touch/chewy meat.   Can't believe I paid $11 for this meal, and I really can't believe that this restaurant was featured on a national food show.

This is the best ramen in Vegas, IMHO - better than Sora & Monta, and all of the other small ramen shops that dot the Vegas landscape.  The salt tonkotsu ramen is the best dish on the menu, and you can pay a couple of dollars more for the Fukumimi ramen (which is a meatier version with sheets of nori).  The chicken karage is just as delicious, and I honestly do not know how they are able to fry the chicken so delicately and keep it ultra-juicy.  Waitstaff is always awesome and pleasant.    It's a fairly small restaurant and it can get packed pretty quickly, but the food is worth the wait.  Two bowls of ramen with a starter of karage for under $20 makes this meal the best value in the city!
