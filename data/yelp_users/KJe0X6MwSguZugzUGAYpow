I've had their food before and it was very good and last night wasn't exactly an exception.  My issue is that my 8 year old had their chicken fingers, which I tried and were quite tasty.  After our meal my son stated he felt ill, and this morning woke up with a mild case of food poisoning.  I will be avoiding this place for the foreeable future.  This is unfortunate, as their enchiladas are delicious but I simply will not risk my son getting sick again.  Sorry Mi Amigos, your apparent lack of food preparation cleanliness has lost you customer.

Disappointing....we brought our kids in with another family on a Tuesday night.  We sat outside and the weather was nice.  It wasn't very busy, but for some reason our food took almost an hour I come and when it did, it was good but that might also be because I was starving.  I frankly expected more at least in service, the waitress was nice but we had to ask for more water, and just felt like we go forgotten.  Not sure if I will be in a hurry to come back...

Yes it's fast food, basic customer service is expected but this location sucks.  The drive through kept having me repeat my order so I just went inside which took forever as well.  Try to avoid.

Christmas time, it's busy.  I arrive at 4:45, the Yelp location says they close at 5.  Just need to mail a package of gifts for my niece and nephew.  Nope guy says their site says they close at 430.  No exceptions even though there are others still inside.  Jerk.  I drive out of my way and even during the holidays you post office people don't even try to shake the image that you're not decent human beings.

The Toluca and the Costa, probably the best breakfast concoctions I can think of.  The food here is awesome and the staff is always friendly.

Well having tried a lot of the other places that serve artisan type pizza, this was on our list and oh how I wished we hadn't waited so long!  Morgan our server was awesome, and the pizza was awesome as well!  My 4 year old LOVED the pepperoni kids pizza and it was perfect size!  I'm very picky about crust, some other places I have gone have had it too doughy, or burnt, too crisp or event too tough.  This place had some of the best crust.  We will definitely be back!

This place is awesome, Arcadia atmosphere without the Arcadia wait.  At least for now.  I'm sure as good as this place is, it won't be long before its 1-2 hours to get in for breakfast.  Highly recommend the Chickichanga, absolutely delicious.  Their kale drink is really good too. It's a hidden away quiet place that's great for kids too.  Highly recommend.
