I was not a believer, but one of my friends said I would not be disappointed so I gave it a shot  Happy Hour in the bar is $5 a person per section ($5 cheese, $5 chocolate, $4, salad, and drink specials as well).  I was super surprised, it was all really good of course, and I was FULL!!!  Also, you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left!  Took a lot of time, I think we were there for like 2 hours but I would do it again.

I love their mexican pizza!  Happy hour in the cantina has great deals, half off appetizers and drink specials.

Best automotive shop in the valley. Family owned, always honest, even to a single girl in her 20's who doesn't look like she knows much :). I've been coming here for over a decade and always get quality work.

Everything is good here! Been coming here about 15 years I would say. Kind of slow, but totally worth it!

My absolute favorite Italian place, all of the food is amazing.  They do a family style meal too that is all you can eat if you are with people who like the same foods.  They are copying Olive garden and doing the "buy one, take one" with their pastas when you dine in so you get two for the price of one!   Seems to always be busy so make a reservation!

I hate going to this Fry's but it is the closest to my house.  The wait time at the deli meat counter is atrocious.  It doesn't matter if there is one person or a huge line, there only ever seems to be one person actually working at a time.  If no one is around, you will wait even longer because they are not paying attention to the counter.  I quit going for a while during reconstruction but went today since it is all done. The store now looks great but still has the same lousy customer service.

I had the Manza sandwich, was really good, just a bit over priced.  Would probably go again to try the pizza on a Friday or Saturday though.

Best Urgent Care around.  I am always in and out quickly with great service.  I don't let my family go anywhere else!  The staff is amazing, perfect combo of kind and efficient.  CVS is next door as well if you need to pick up a prescription as well.

Anngela is amazing! She has treated my entire family for years from acne to skin cancer screenings.  She is personable, professional, and runs on time.  My last two visits I was in and out in under a half hour.

Quick delivery but probably the worst pizza I have had in a long time.  Garlic knots were not anything special, and even the fried zucchini wasn't good... I didn't know you could have bad fried zucchini!

Ordered take out tonight and there is parking right up front for to-go.  I would have to say when I looked at the pizza I was a bit bummed but it turned out to be one of the best pies I've had in a while.  The ingredient were flavorful and generous with the toppings.  They I will definitely be back!
