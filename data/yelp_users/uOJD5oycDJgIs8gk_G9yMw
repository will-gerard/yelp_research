I finally stopped at this spot.  I had been wanting a Raspado and decided to search for "raspados"on  Yelp of course. I was ordered a Masedonia, something similar to a raspado with mango, and strawberries, topped with a scoop of delicious strawberry Icecream  & lechera treat! Oh my... this place is sooo good! Definitely coming back :)

Ok, So like every girl I like my Nails Did and so I usually have my usual nail lady (For a reason) Ladies you all know Once  you find her KEEP her...don't cheat..like I did..  Let's get to the Good stuff, It was the day before  4th of July, my nails needed to be re done, BAD... wanted to look you know, Good for the holiday.  Ok so finally after going to three different salons (in PHX near my work) that by the way were Jammed packed, I decided to go to one near me (TMP) aaand just so you all know I read reviews, before I buy, or try anything!!!! Just saying...I wanted to try and see for myself...  The Good?? They had working A/C, It was not packed, and the atmosphere was relaxing..quiet. So Anyway at this point I was like JUST GET ME A GEL Manicure!!! I forgot to ask for colors they had...the price for their Mani..(usually pay $25) and...yeah...so it went like this..  I sat down, tired..hot...the nice man sits in his chair...files my nails SHORT  with a USED square file thingy...ew..(grrrr..btw Im trying to grow my nails....sir) then finally finishes and I then asked for Colors...I wanted Hot Pink..for the Summer..you think he had it? NOPE.   I had to pick this ugly pink..(no Color Variety) then he only applied two thin coats!!! Like whaatttt??? (Oh it gets BETTER) It was finally done...he had been going back and forth with another customer..so I felt unattended at times..but he did ok and finished in a timely matter I guess...So I get up to Pay and Guess what...  Lady was like "$35.00 Dollah" O_o I was like "$35.00?!!" ...she asked "Would you like for me to charge $35.00 Even?" I was like...(in my head) "Really? did you want a tip and some ice-cream with that too?!!! LOL Oh wow...if I knew it was gonna cost me that I would of been like I need two more Coats of Polish please!!!!   I was Dissappointed....What a waste of $...Never Again.

I was looking for a place to get my Yearly Exam done, and My sister had visited this place. I decided to make an appointment and they offered Same day or Next Day appointments, so if you are looking to be see ASAP, they will accommodate! I was very pleased with the way I was treated over the phone. I scheduled an appointment for the following week, with no problem.  Wow The place is Beautiful, from Cleanliness to Decor I was just so impressed. You are greeted as soon as you step inside, and the attention is on you, You really feel Special here :D  I got to see Lisa! She was Professional and very Knowledgable in what she is an Expert at. She was very patient, and I felt very comfortable with her. She is young and confident in answering all your questions. I Loved it here! The whole experience from getting there to leaving was Amazing, the entire staff is on Point! Very Happy Patient here!

Horrible food! I was in town for the weekend, I decided to go try this Chinese food place,instead of eating Subway and I regret it!  The food was disgusting,I got sick. Never again, the only good thing? The Fortune cookie.
