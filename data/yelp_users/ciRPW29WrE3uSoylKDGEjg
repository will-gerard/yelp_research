I love getting my nails done here. Not only is the quality and cleanliness outstanding, Tina, Kim and David are wonderful and welcoming. If you want to get quality work done in a comfortable atmosphere, this is the place for you. I've been coming here for the past 2 years and I look forward to many more.

The fieldhouse is one of the most inconsistent places I've been. One week the service is great and the staff is attentive and the food is good and the next the service & the food is awful.  Just a few days ago my roommate & I stopped in after work for happy hour & dinner. It took 15 min just for us to be acknowledged by the waitress and another 20 min to get our first drink & put in our order.  After 50 min we finally got our food, without silverware. Which took another 10 min for us to get. We were never offered a 2nd drink the rest of the time we were there until we requested the check. The food was not good & the service was even worse. I have gone on other occasions  later in the evening & the bartenders were great, but the atmosphere was ehhh. It actually seems like the "regulars" want to keep new people from coming in. I will probably go back, because let's face it it's Gilbert,  and that's where other friends want to go from time to time, but I will be sure and not have very high expectations.

I am so excited about the new changes at Greenfield Nails. The new management has done a wonderful job of staffing the salon with nice and talented people and the place has never looked as clean and modern as it does now. I was a regular of the salon before since it is so close to my home, but now even if I moved I would stay a regular. The quality and price of the services make it all worth it! I highly recommend you stop in and check out the changes and try a service, you will be hooked too!

So I'd love to write a great review but I'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers. Why? Because my friend and I (both women) could not justify paying a $5 cover to see a fight that 1. We could careless about. 2. Could see up the street for free 3. Could have parked in the parking lot and watched. So, sorry to say we will be spending our money and tipping well here at Gordon Biersch.

I would love to write a review on the food but after our hour + wait to get in, when we were told 40 minutes.  We have now been sitting in our booth for an hour.  My coffee I initially did not get after ordering,  and my second refill took 30 minutes after asking twice.  We have to much time invested into leaving now but... Damn this really is not the way to have people bring in the New Year... Oh and the hostess was extremely sarcastic and rude when we asked how much longer after an hour had passed.  Great now an espn camera crew is in the kitchen .. Wonder if they are eating my food... Forget breakfast, I should have ordered dinner..... Still waiting and I even finished writing this review.... 1 hope 15 min in and still waiting on food...
