I've been on a mission to try a new pizza place weekly. I love pizza - I like thin or hand crust primarily. Open to a variety of toppings w/the exception of ham and pineapple. I have tried at least 15 restaurants recently and hands down this place has THE BEST PIZZA EVER!! Shock Top on tap, Lots of TV's and a couple pool tables. I might add our bartender/waitress had at least 10 other people at the bar and took care of the other server and still treated us to outstanding service and two different types of peanuts!! This is a no frills bar, so don't expect fancy - but do expect exceptional pizza. I will be back!

I love this place. I've been coming here for about 8 years now. The food is consistently great, the service is prompt and polite. The music isn't to loud which is nice if you want to have a conversation. Small space but comfortable; 8 booths with seating in the middle. It's not super fancy or upscale and they do not serve alcohol. I chose green curry with chicken for lunch it was under $8 it came with soup and and a egg roll. They have a great menu with a lot of variety.  Nom Nom Nom.

I'm happy to hear that some folks out there have good things to say about this Denny's but I don't! I live close by and Denny's usually has great breakfast, it's safe and you know what your getting however; this location breaks the norm. I've given it the benefit of the doubt so many times, but no more.       Slow Service     Cold food     Incorrect orders     If you like hot tea....good luck getting more hot water     The staff doesn't check on you after receiving your meal     No WiFi service     Dirty silverware  I dislike this Denny's so much that I actually logged in to write about it. The last time I did this was years ago. THEY SUCK.  A discriminating foodie.   Groovygirlaz

Amazing, the food that is. They have a fab lunch buffet with many popular choices. All dishes are made fresh which is nice. They are able to make special dishes upon request as well. The chef's are from Thailand so if you like authentic Thai - you will enjoy the food.  They do not offer adult beverages however; if you bring in a bottle they will be happy to serve it to you without charging a corking fee.  Not amazing: The service is something to be desired. They only have one person to help customers and he isn't the most attentive waiter so if you want a free drink refill you may have to track him down.     One odd item to note the last four times we have been in there for lunch we have been unable to locate napkins. However, they do offer cloth napkins for dinner service.  They prefer not to split the tab so be sure to let them know upfront if you require separate checks.

Amazing! Hands down one of the best restaurants for breakfast in North Phoenix. It is clean, the food is delish and out server, Ms. Divina, is fantastic. She went out of her way to ensure we were satisfied! If you want a great experience, sit in her section. The cost is reasonable too - approx $10 a person. Oh, and if u are a hot tea drinker like me, they have an excellent variety to choose from.  The time is 7:48 am and they are already busy!

Service is a little slow however, the staff is friendly and helpful.  The food portions are large and very tasty. Two cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees - cost $50.00.  They have a bar with TV's so you can watch sports. (Football is almost here.... YAY!)    I also went back for breakfast a couple weeks later.  Service was slow however, breakfast was delish and affordable.   Note: you may want to double check your bill - we were charged for an item we never ordered or received.    Overall in my opinion, it's good Italian food and nice addition to the North Phoenix area.

Fresh, delicious food - very authentic!! They fly in famous singers for live music every weekend! For all you hooka lovers they have a menu of different types of tobacco. All smoking is done outside which I love coming home with my hair still smelling beautiful. All of their hummus and baba are made daily. This is one start us restaurant that I hope to see around for a long time. If you come in the evening ask for Steven. He's the bartender and is absolutely fabulous.
