I don't get it.  We had bottle service.  The drinks were meh.  The music wasn't much better.  I couldn't get my dance on.  Tao kept launching streamers in the air which of course landed in my champagne each and every time.  Strict dress code.  *Please keep in mind that I am not a clubber, I like to lounge Hollywood style.

I ordered the lunch special -- salad and slice of pizza.  Gluten-free pizza is easy to get wrong, this place makes a nice GF crust that has a bite.    My husband initially guffawed at the prices for mere pizza.  I said, "but it's organic."  He rolled his eyes.  But then he ate it and he understood that he was paying extra for freshness.  He even gave a thumbs up to my "GF nastiness" as he refers to all things GF.  Thank you Picazzo for making a point to my dear lover which I was unable to make previously.
