I searched online for a cosmetic dentist prior to my son's wedding in December of 2012. I just wanted to have composite redone on one of my front teeth. I should say that the office is lovely, the staff is very gracious and the hygienist is great. I think Dr. Price is perhaps a great dentist but my personal experience was an absolute nightmare - and I'm still living it. .   During my initial visit I was told that veneers on my two front teeth would look wonderful. The first flag was the expense - $1585 per veneer.  Keep in mind that this was Christmas time and before my son's wedding. They made it sound so wonderful and easy that I decided to go for it (despite the hefty expense).  Keep in mind that having your teeth shaved is not fun, but the resulting temporaries looked very good. I was happy. The following month is when the veneers were applied - then the nightmare began. The first set of veneers were applied in January of 2013 and were not bad, but I couldn't floss between the teeth and they were a bit long. When this was corrected a portion of one of the teeth fell out so the veneers had to be redone.    So I had to again have temporaries applied. Well, they fell out three times while I waiting weeks for the new veneers to come in. One time they fell out on a Saturday so I was toothless and couldn't leave the house until Monday morning.  Another time it was on a Thursday night when I was leaving on a airplane the next day. Luckily, Dr Grant was available to glue it back in.   During this time the office double billed my debit card - $900 and it took several days to correct. Then the new veneers came in and they were still too long. And the shape never came out the same as the temporaries and the veneers are opaque unlike natural teeth so now my teeth don't match. Then, during this time, I needed a root canal and a crown and the office billed the full amount to my insurance (and I still don't have the crown) and I had to pay the other doctor for my root canal out of pocket because my insurance had been used up for the year.    I've always had nice teeth - and have always been known for my smile - and now I don't want to smile. Three other dentists have told me that I will need to have a minimum of 6 new (but probably 10) veneers to make my teeth blend and they all agree the teeth are bulky and opaque. My front teeth also protrude now - almost like I need braces and my front teeth are long and hang over my lowers (which wasn't the case before). By the way, if you met me today they probably don't look that bad but I know the difference and in pictures you can definitely see the difference.  I met with Dr. Price to get my money back for the two veneers (I had also had spent 2k on other work which was done well) and she said that she had told me I would need to have more veneers from the start but that is not the case. I would NEVER have agreed to get the two front veneers done if I knew this - this would cost 10K or more! Now I am looking to going through the pain and expense of getting a full set of veneers PLUS pay to have the two front ones redone. I don't have the money or the time.  In a lot of ways I really like Dr. Grant - she is a great lady - but this is too much. As for the expense, I don't mind paying more for quality but I certainly didn't get what I paid for and now I will have to pay much more to get it fixed. I hope this doesn't happen to ANYONE else. It was the worst dental experience I've ever had and unfortunately it's not over yet.

I recently attended a Murder Ink Productions murder mystery show at Fazio's in Chandler.  I brought my husband and two friends - they had never experienced a mystery production before (I had attended one a long time ago). Well, we all loved it!  The play was set in the 1960's and the actors interacted with the audience (if you've never been to one of these before,some of the audience will actually get "into the act" and play different characters to solve the crime).  It was absolutely hilarious and we can't wait to see another production! There were also several large groups who attended the same show and they were all talking about how much they loved it, too. I would highly recommend Murder Ink mysteries to anyone!

I've had dental nightmares with two overpriced dentists since moving to Phoenix 3 years ago -  Baseline Dental has been a pleasant surprise.  I found them a year ago when I had a veneer "temporary" fall out and I couldn't reach my regular dentist. I did a search online and called their office. It was 5 PM when I left a message and Dr. Payne called me back within an hour - and I wasn't even their patient!  I believe he was out of town at the time and couldn't help but I was so impressed by that.  Recently I went to them for a dental cleaning and some other work and they were excellent and the fees were reasonable.  I highly recommend them.

Eye Priority is phenomenal!  I've had problems my entire life with wearing contacts. Dr DiSimone gave me the most comprehensive eye exam I've ever had and I now have contacts that are comfortable!  I am so impressed. They are professional and every aspect of the practice is top notch. If you have problem eyes you must check them out.

My husband and I recently went to 5 and Diner on a Sunday morning and we were impressed.  Not only is the decor cute and retro, we had fantastic service and our breakfasts were wonderful!  It was really a nice surprise.  We plan to go back again soon.

Since moving to Phoenix two years ago I've experienced a number of hair "disasters. " Bad cuts, color jobs - it's been incredibly frustrating.   I recently started going to Anthony Vigil at Saints & Scissors after seeing the wonderful job that he did on a friend's hair. Getting a good blonde shade that is pretty - while keeping your hair healthy -  can be a challenge but Anthony is a master at it.  He's managed to correct my color and is helping me grow out my uneven cut from a former stylist while allowing me to keep most of my length.    Anthony is also personable, professional and very responsive. When I recently told him that I felt I needed a few more lowlights he immediately fit me in. To make things even better, the salon prices are reasonable.  I would highly recommend Anthony and this salon!

I moved to Phoenix a little over a year ago.  Since arriving, I've had a number of hair "tragedies" in terms of cut and color.  A friend of mine recommended that I see Andrew at Ish Salon.  Andrew cut and color-corrected my over-stressed hair a week ago.  While at first I felt the color was a bit "ashy" (as part of the correction) it has turned out beautifully.  The color is even and pretty and my hair feels like hair again.  He also called me yesterday to make sure everything was OK! What I really appreciate, though, is that he really listened to what I was wanting and gave me honest advice as to what he could - or couldn't do.  In any case, I'm a believer.  Everyone at the salon was courteous and it had a great "vibe."  I would highly recommend this salon and especially Andrew.  He is very talented.

I went to Bob recently to be "hypnotized" to help cure me of a nasty smoking habit. I had seen him perform at a large event and was fascinated by the process. First of all, I will admit that I was a bit skeptical.  I wasn't sure if I even could be hypnotized! Bob first asks you several questions to find out your "triggers" and then the session begins.  I have to tell you, I have tried the patch, lozenges, but found this therapy more powerful and effective than anything else I have tried.  After only one session my nicotine cravings are virtually nonexistent!  I would recommend Bob highly to anyone with a smoking or other habit that they are trying to deal with.

I recently contacted this agency on behalf of my father and mother-in-law who desperately needed home care assistance. I called on a Thursday and Care with Confidence went above and beyond to arrange a home visit the very next day and were able to schedule a caregiver almost immediately. They were incredibly responsive, professional and their rates are very competitive.  I was very pleased and would highly recommend them to other families.

Care with Confidence took care of my father and mother-in-law for a while last year (they only needed help temporarily) and I was very happy with their services.  I had to re-contact them recently to get some information for a friend of the family and they responded promptly and professionally and even remembered my in-laws! I was very pleased - and appreciative. They provide quality care and I recommend them highly.
