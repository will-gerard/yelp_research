Dim and a bit moody when you walk in, but nice and cozy the minute you finally take a seat. To put it simply , this place serves comfort food at it's finest. The assortment of meat pies is phenomenal. Although you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu, my personal favorite is the Cajun. Between the flakey, moist, buttery crust and the spicy chicken, it is definitely a fine creation. Come check it out. You won't be disappointed

Meat..fried potatoes...gravy.  Three of my favorite things in the world and the do them all oh so well here. I typically come here for the Jewish sliders but every now and then I mix it up and get something different. But those sliders? Phenomenal. The beef is so tender it basically falls off the sandwich. The rolls the come on have the perfect amount of sweet to compliment the saltiness of the meat, cheese, and gravy. The little potato pancake they put on the sliders gives a nice crunch and compliments the flavors of the rest of the slider perfectly. Oh man and the brown gravy?It's definitely something I'd smother my food in on a daily basis if I weren't trying to watch what Im eating. All in all I am always a happy camper when I visit chompies.

I went here for the first time as a part of a Yelp event for new hires. My friend Amanda just got hired so I was especially excited to be able to share the experience with her. We went during the afternoon, and it had a very laid back vibe, which I really enjoyed. I only had a beer and some tacos (which were AMAZING!) so my overall experience was somewhat limited. But in the short time i spent there I was definitely impressed, and will be back very soon.

There haven't been very many times that I've been to a restaurant where the customer service is so suspect that it actually manages to damper the quality of the good. When we were seated the hostess and waitress both explained to us that the prices were discounted for happy hour. We ended up ordering a spicy tuna roll, an eel roll, and a Vegas roll, along with plum wine. The food and wine was phenomenal. The check afterwards? Not so much. We essentially had a bait and switch pulled and the waitress explained that she only meant a very specific portion of the menu was at a happy hour price, which isn't was was explained earlier. Although the food is great I can't say I'd give my patronage to a restaurant that is so dismissive of first time customers that it results in said customers paying $40 more than anticipated. I probably won't be back here

As far as i'm concerned, this location is solid. The facility is enormous, and it is always in immaculate condition. I normally go during the evening, so it's usually a bit quieter during those hours. The staff is always friendly, and if I ever need a tip for working out a specific body part they are very helpful with addressing any inquiries that I might have. I guess my only complaint is the weird plates they have. I don't like how they have the flat edges because it gets awkward when i'm doing power cleans and other olympic style lifts that start from the floor. Besides that, this place is A-OK.

The location is definitely one of the main selling points for me. It's right down the street from my job and next door to trader joes. The place itself is solid. The toppings are always fresh and the cashiers are always really friendly. I guess the one thing that kinda bums me out is the lack of consistency in the selection of yogurts. I am a big fan of fruity yogurt but I notice besides maybe 2 fruit flavored yogurts the rest of the fruity selection are sorbets. It's not a huge deal but it's be nice to have a bigger selection on the fruit yogurts. Besides that the place is great. Definitely a great choice!

Simple, but efficient  I didn't really know what to expect from this place. My friend has been hyping it for weeks, so I finally decided to check it out. I loved the vibe when I walked in. It was, surprisingly "hipstery"? (Is that a word?) but pleasant. It was definitely nothing like the typical Starbucks or other coffee chains. The menu was basic and to the point, and I didn't feel overwhelmed by the number if choices or fillers that a lot of other places I've visited. The iced green tea I had was outstanding. Overall, I was happy with my visit. Ill definitely be back

This was my first visit and as soon as I walked up I loved how it just seemed like it was a party with all the music playing and flashing lights everywhere. Ordered the iced carmelizer which is basically an iced mocha with a ton of caramel in it. I've got to say I'm pretty impressed. Typically drinks like this are so sweet you can't taste the coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of sugar. As an extra perk they even have a stamp card where if you get 10 your next one is free. I came on one of their special days so I got 9 stamps on my first ever visit! Ill definitely be back

I've got to say I absolutely LOVE this place. The service, and food are amazing on their own, but the drinks? Oh good lord. The bartenders here blow these other chumps I'm Tempe out of the friggin water. They are all beyond friendly and happy to hold a long chat with you, and their mixing skills are definitely on point. This is definitely my go to place if I don't feel like lowering my standards for a drink.

Not a terrible place for your girlfriend to drag you along if she's making you shop with her. They have plenty of seating for the weary boyfriend and plenty of stuff to keep the mrs. distracted. A pretty large selection of things for her to ask if you like, just so she can ignore your opinion anyhow. I can't complain too much because we did find something for her that we could agree on.  I'd give this place 5 stars but there's nothing in my size that I liked in the men's section
