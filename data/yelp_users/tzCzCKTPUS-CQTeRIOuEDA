Rooms are decent and the beds are VERY COMFY! Free access to the pool and amenities when we went.  Downside: Our toilet was spewing like a geyser and we saw a humungo roach crawl across the floor. Called maintenance/front and they acted like we should've expected it....that was after the 3rd call to them. WOW!  Tip: Try the raspberry mojito at the pool bar. The 2 for 1 drink specials are gonna get you snockerbockered!

This is by far one of the strangest food joints I've been to. You can wait in the 'lounge' and have a drink and a smoke by the 'water firepits'? You have to take off your hat, but that's cool.  This place was anything but classy, but ya know what...I felt comfortable as hell.  The food and bloody mary was great. The service was good. Best breakfast on the strip...HANDS DOWN!

Visited this place the last time in Vegas.  I have to say I'd recommend it. It's in a little strip mall way off the strip, but worth the drive. Everything tasted great and the service was really good.

I remember coming to Popo's in the 90's and it was tha shiz! I'm not sure why I liked it so much. Maybe the recipe's changed since then, but it really isn't as great as it used to be. It might be that my palate has matured with all the great Mexican food I get in San Diego or maybe the thrill is just gone...

I was not sure what to expect when walking into a Hobby Lobby for the first time. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This place is Craft/DIY/Pinterest heaven! Kind of like a Micheal's meets Home Goods meets Hell Yeah (even though the Christians ran joint might not like that reference too much)!   If you see something on Pinterest and need to find the materials/tools/etc. necessary to do the job, most likely you will find them here! The odds are forever in your favor. If you are looking to spruce up that living room or your man cave, you will even find decor items to help. I could easily spend a week and thousands of $$$ here....and I'm sure you could to. Leave the credit card at home!

Ok, I'm jealous. Usually when I come visit the fam in AZ, I get jealous over SOMETHING. Pink Taco (RIP), drive-thru Panda Express, Saddle Ranch or whatever. On the way to g-ma's house I see "frozen custard" on the sign and HAD to stop...and I'm glad i did.   The burger was pretty damn good, but the custard was DY-NO-MITE! Oh, and the fries....best fries I've had from a "fast food" place. If you live in AZ, you owe it to yourself to try this place. If you're not in AZ, u might wanna make a visit just for Freddie's. I know I will...until they get sense enough to open one in S.D.

So I came to Phoenix to visit my family for Mothers Day. My family originally wanted IHOP, but I told them I wanted to try something new. They suggested that we go to Black Bear Diner, but they were closed. So I went on Yelp and suggested Scramble. I'm glad I did.  I tried the French Toast(delicious!) and sampled some of the other fare off of peoples plates. The pancakes were a bit rubbery, but the service, ambiance and other good food made up for the shortcoming.  I definitely recommend it.  Everyone else in our 10+ party enjoyed their food and said they'd probably come back.  It's in a kinda weird area for me, since growing up here that particular area was referred to as the "ghetto". But it seems to have changed in the 10+ years I've been gone. The decor is Ikea-like, but comfortable. They have seating inside and out (if you can stand the heat!). They also have 'misters' outside.

Visited the place on the last day of our stay, during our last trip to Vegas. It was a great find. On a Sunday late morning, we had no problem finding seating. The menu had a few good things on it, but we decided to go with the Steakhouse sandwich that was HUGE and TASTY! The frozen hot chocolate was pretty good too, but nothing to ga ga about.  Overall, if you're in Vegas and can't figure out where to eat...do yourself a favor and try this place out.

Freddy's is my go-to diner burger after In N Out. The burgers are tasty and the fries are shoestring delicious! The concretes and shakes will have you beggin on your knees!

I like this location b/c I'm from San Diego. When I'm coming into/leaving from town, this is a convenient location to stop at. Check out my other profile review for the full Freddy's report. DELICIOUS!

Visiting AZ for a wedding with a few hours to kill, so my brothers dropped me and Squiggly on Mill Avenue to fend for ourselves. Keep in mind that it's been YEARS since I've roamed these streets... After walking for a few we notice World Of Beer. At first glance all we could see were rows of bottles of beers , so we thought it was a liquor store. We decided to take a closer look and to our surprise it was indeed a bar. HELLA beers on tap...cute bartenders...outside patio for smoking and people watching. We had a great time and the girls were SUPER nice and helpful in letting us sample beers. Met some cool people and had a great time. Will definitely recommend this spot.

Brother in law turned me on to their wings. We were having a pool party for his daughter's H.S. graduation. Good amount of heat and the chicken was cooked all the way through. If you're having a party and don't wanna cook, I suggest you give these guys a ring.
