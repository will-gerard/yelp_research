Had a wonderful party at this place last night for a friend.  The back patio is perfect for this time of year with a nice private and relaxing feel.  The food was creative and wonderful and the wine was the perfect temp.    A musician by the name of Blaine Long was playing on the patio and the guy just blew me away.  All original music, great style and feel, and he knows how to control volume and tone so damn well.  Certainly the best musician I have heard in an Arizona bar/restaurant after living here for 15 years.    I will certainly be back to experience an evening without the party.  The staff was very good and professional.  They thought of everything the guests could need including blankets for a baby when the temps dropped.

I've had two real positive experiences with this shop.  Once for tint and the other for front windshield replacement.  On both visits the shop was professional, well priced and on time.  They followed up with information i requested on side window pricing immediately and the tint they did install is perfect.  Zero bubbles or any visible defects.  Great shop and would not hesitate to recommend.  You may also want to check groupon if you need some work done as they often have deals there.

I have been eating here for almost 10 years.  It has always been one of my favorites.  Their Pho Ga is amazing and so are their spring rolls.  All of the dishes we have had are great and you have to try the Cafe Su Da which is a coffee that slowly drips into sweet condensed milk.  It is a real treat.    The past three times I have been there however they seem to have changed their noodles or the way they cook them.  They are too soft and mushy which really put a dent into my enjoyment.  These small thin rice noodles are in the pho and the spring rolls (and many other dishes) so this really bothers me.   The service is faster than fast food yet it is always fresh and good.  They have great Jasmine Team and it is served in the whole pot which is nice.    Cleanliness could be improved but this is a pretty traditional place.  Oh, I almost forgot the secret.  If you are hung over you have to come here.  Here is the miracle cure second to swimming in a cold ocean.  - Whole fresh coconut (drink) - Pho Ga (Chicken Noodle Soup in a beef broth)  - Make sure to add Siracha hot sauce to kick up the sweat.  - Cafe Su Da - nice caffeine blast.  The Pho needs to be spiced up enough to make you sweat.  After that, your hang over is gone !!!!  Whoohooo

What happened to this place?  it used to be one of my favorite places and now the food has gone way down hill. Worse, our family has gotten food poisoning the last two times they ate there so it is no more for us.  What a shame this place used to be amazing.

OK so call me a sucker but I went back because it was Monday and several of my other "go-to" lunch spots were closed. Much to my surprise, Saigon Pho is BACK!  After a horrible dip in quality, something happened and the food is back up to par as it had always been.  I've now been back four times just to confirm my finding and each time it's been great.  I couldn't be happier because I've yet to find a place with broth like theirs.    Welcome back Saigon Pho.  You have sorely been missed.

I stopped in for a late lunch with my son and was very pleasantly surprised at just how good the service was here.  We had drinks by the time we sat down and our baba ganoush app was there in light speed.  The food was very good and the Gyro that followed were huge and amazing.   Very cool artwork on the walls and the nice and clear appearance make this place high on my list for a quick byte for lunch. A bit more upscale than your average lunch spot yet with the prices and service that are better than most.  Will certainly be back for a tasty Gyro.

Certainly one of the top sushi restaurants in the valley and getting better every day.  I've been to them all and Shimogamo, Yasu's, and Toyama are high above the rest of them.  Warm and inviting, this place is a classy well decorated and lit restaurant tucked into a strip mall.  Head sushi chef Zach has an appetite for bringing in interesting fish and items and is never allowing his customers to get board.  His efforts to bring in new and fresh fish are a reward for those of us who have eaten sushi all of our lives.  It is also a great place to go to early and get some great prices on beer and food.  $4 large Sapporo when many places try and get $8-$10.    A few things are a must if you come here.  The salmon skin rolls here is done 10X better than any place I have ever eaten at.  They make sure the skin is warm and crispy and loaded up.  The sweet shrimp are also a winner.  I spent most of my life not liking raw shrimp but Shimogamo has changed my mind.  I also love all of the crispy parts of the body that are cooked.  Oysters are always wonderful here as are the fresh scallops when they have them.  An absolute must is the Escolar with the Jalapeno.   I never ate Escolar prior and I would normally think that a Jalapeno would overpower such a mild fish but just GET IT.  They torch the fish to draw out some fats and the Jalapeno has wicked smoky flavor.  If you don't like it I can truly say you are strange!  :)  The toro the last few times is better than anything I have tasted in a decade.    The king salmon, fresh mackerel, and Uni are always fresh and perfect.     Everything we have had from the "cooked" kitchen is also very good so even if your friends do not eat sushi I would not hesitate to bring them along.    Be careful for lunch because they are only open on Friday I believe.  Reservations are a good idea unless you are there very early or late.  Music is always right on with nice ambient grooves from Thievery Corp and similar bands.    Lastly if you have a large private party for a special occasion they have a back room that can feel very private and classy.  We had a B-day there for 12 and it was perfect.

Your gonna love it or hate it.  This place is somewhat unique spurred on my owner Justine.  She is Sassy for sure and she reminds me somewhat of the soup Nazi.  She will pick on you, insult you, hit on you, and more in the same evening.  You will either enjoy this or feel uncomfortable.    The food is good and some of my favorites are the green papaya salad, Pad Thai, and Suon Non.    Bring a six pack of a nice Asian beer if you are going because it is BYOB.  You may or may not get your left overs back  :)  The service needs work for sure but I have not found it as bad as many reference in their reviews.  I guess when you have a beer in your hand it is easier to wait or tolerate.   Enjoy!

Great vibe to this place feeling much like a local coffee shop but perhaps a little less warm.  The menu is diverse and I love seeing local brews available.  The wood fired brick oven turns out great pizza and they have a great variety on their menu.    This place is cafeteria style when ordering then they bring you your food.  Seating is rather uncomfortable which is one of the one dings I have for it other than the price which is a little on the high side considering the experience.  Regardless this is a great place with great food so do not shy away.

Oh man this place is good.  Anyone that is smart enough to combine great fries, green chillies, Bacon and cheese together gets big time points from me.  They also make all of their breads which is killer.    Creative sandwiches, good beers, amazing service, fresh food, good pizza.  Homemade stuff in an open kitchen from people who "get" food.   It is a little small and cramped and if you have to wait, you better be ready to wait outside because I always feel like an ogre trying to wait in the inside 3X3 waiting area.

Arizona Cactus sales is a great place and I sure wish Yelp would support half stars because they are a 4.5.  What do I like about them?:  - They plant in native soil so there is no shock to the plant when dropped into our yards.  Less shock means more success.    - They mark the sun orientation based on how it was grown.  No sun shock means more success.    - They know their plants and can give you accurate information on watering, size, pests, etc.    - I've never seen anything there that does not belong in the Valley of the Sun.  I am still amazed at how many plants bigbox stores try and sell that only belong in CA.  They tag plants with the scientific name so that you can learn more once you get home.    On the down side they are a bit expensive, particularly for larger plants.   Because your plants will thrive once you place them in the ground they are well worth the additional cost over bigbox.    I also must say that one of the most beautiful cactus I have in my yard is from ACS.  They sold me what they called Taylor's Pride which is a Myrtillocactus geometrizans and Isolatocereus (or stenocereus) dumortieri.  If you can get one you should.  Amazing color and beautiful flowers.

I would say that Yao's serves up the best Lo Mein I've ever had with a nice flavor from a hot wok.  We have had several of their chicken dishes and it never disappoints.  The mu shu pork (sp?) it also very good and has excellent flavor.  I also like how they leave their veggies slightly crisp which gives them a great texture with the noodles and rice.  I have not dined in yet there as my house is so close but the dining room is rather bland looking.  It does look clean however.

This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it.  At that time they also had competent staff.  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times.  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try.  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window.  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy.  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering, just run like hell.

I just got back from "eating" at Pepin and had to immediately write a review.  We had a table of 12 reserved and were seated promptly on a packed Sat night.  We sat and waited for 15min before anyone took a drink order.  The sangria was pretty bad and only had a piece of orange in terms of fruit.  Most of us ordered paella valencia which we were told feeds about 1 1/2 people which I immediately thought odd.  Is it not obvious that it should either serve one or two?!?  Regardless we ordered four for six people.  A hour later the food appeared.    No salads and the bread was served with Ranch dressing (no butter).  Our drinks remained empty for most of the night including the water.  The food was pretty poor and the portions were horrible.  I got one clam, one shrimp, and a few pieces of chicken in my plate.  The mussel I had on my plate had a cracked shell so I did not eat it.  I was actually embarrassed.    On a high note the singer/guitar player/dancer were pretty darn good.  They kept us entertained while we waited forever.  Unfortunately they were quite loud for the small space with low ceilings so it was near impossible to talk at the table.  If you do go, DO NOT sit in front of the stage unless you just want to hear them and not each other.  The good entertainment soon left my mind when we got the bill.  My son had a $7 hamburger, my daughter split a crab cake, and my wife and I had the paella valencia.  One glass of sangria each and the bill was $110.  The also automatically added the gratuity.  Great trick when your service sucks!

A true owner operated gem in Scottsdale all because Razz knows and cares.  He is an amazing chef who is fearless and cooks and entertains seamlessly throughout the evening.  His food is wonderful and complex with many layers of flavors and ingredients you will often not find elsewhere.  He loves food and wine and his place reflects this.    The best and only tip I can give you is to sit that the bar (chef's table) and do the tastings meal.  He will bring out small plates one after the other until you are full.  Of if you are like me, till bursting!    The last time I dined there with a group I asked Razz for a Pinot Noir recommendation and he steered us toward the cheapest in his lot.  He was correct in that it was an amazing wine but this goes to show his style, honestly and integrity.  His food is the same way.  If you are into art he has an amazing selection.  You could have fun just walking about the place.  The atmosphere is great and it usually has just the right amount of people there.  Everyone seems to know Razz.   Great place, great chef.  Thanks Razz!

I have eaten sushi most of my life and have been to the best of the best within many of the major US cities including NYC, SanFran, and LA.  Without exception Toyama has the best quality fish I have ever encountered which is quite strange considering it is right in the middle of the desert.  Chef/Owner Mo Kugaguchi takes pride in his quality and does things most other sushi restaurants never take the time or care to do.  I have eaten there countless times and have yet to experience anything questionable or of sub-par quality ever.   If it is not good and fresh, it will not be served.  If any of the reviews indicate bad fish (or chewy salmon as one person states) they simply do not know what good fish is.  Toyama is about the only place in the valley that uses FRESH WHOLE Hamachi which is usually found being broken down right there in front of you.  Just about every other place purchases the IQF loins shipped from Japan which can be OK but will never stand up to fresh.  It is simply the best you can find.   If you are new to sushi or find your favorites in California and spicy tuna rolls, you may not realize the benefit of this place.    If you like Bluefin, toro, FRESH Hamachi, Uni, Saba, Halibut, and other more 'interesting' sushi items, THIS IS YOUR PLACE!   Lastly, this is a place for a foodie, not someone looking for a cool Scottsdale scene or entertainment.  It is a bit on the pricy side but the fish itself is very expensive to buy so it is more of a market thing than directly with Toyama.  Good fresh fish is expensive.

Always the best with no regrets.  Their Il Purista sandwich is about as good as it gets.  This time I got warm bread with cool ingredients speaking to the freshness of everything they do.  The deserts were all perfect and I think our group downed six bottles of wine while there.  Great prices on wine in case you have not looked.  We had a 2010 Zepaltas La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast that knocked my socks off.  Damn good wine!!!!  The Linguine with white clam is killer as are anything with their meatballs.  In the deli case is a home made sausage rolled like a spiral that has parsley and cheese that has to be the best stuff on earth.  If you have not tried it just do it with some good bread they sell there and you will be in love!  I've known Tony for a long time now and must say he and his wife are some of the sweetest people.  It is great to see a family owned and operated restaurant do so well and keep/improve their quality over time.  It's places like this that keep food alive and well in America and keep the massive restaurant corporations away from ever receiving a dime of my money.    I've been in the back kitchen and the place is spotless.  Everything they do they do well and they are a solid Yelp 5-star joint.  I just wish he would open a Gilbert store in DT Gilbert.  Would be a perfect place for that location!

Great food for sure but that is it.  Unless you are shopping for groceries then don't expect much of anything you would not find in a cafeteria.  Yet for some reason this place just works.  The service is unusually good in a place like this and  the food comes out fast and delicious.  I have had about half of the food on this menu and have never been disappointed. Come to Haji's to be full and chat with some friends over good food.  It may have you searching for more napkins but your belly will be happy.

A great place with a great product.  The pulled pork is amazing and the ribs are as well.  The baked potato with a massive glob of butter and sour cream is about as good as it gets when topped with ham or pulled pork.   I love the soda selection and the homemade rootbeer is cool although too sweet for my taste.  Great spot if you have kids even more so when it is nice outside so they can run around and climb trees etc.    On the down side they only have two sauces both of which are the dark sweet stuff.  One is mild and the other is hot.  I wish they had some additional (perhaps vinegar based) choices considering you are a BBQ shop.   Lastly I know they are shooting for a family atmosphere but they do not serve any beer.  It is not the place you hang out in after you are done eating so I really fail to understand why they do not support local micro-brewers in the area.  Oh man....thinking hard now about a Four Peaks 8th Street Ale with a "Jumbo All Pork!"  Dear Lord I will never be thin!

Phoenicia is a very consistent good restaurant and I think they and Pita Jungle get top notch ranks for their Gyros, They also have the best Chicken Shwarma which is always juicy and cooked with a wonderfully smokey flavor.    The restaurant is clean and the staff is always very personal and warm.  They have a little section of to go items and the pitas they have a quite good when picked up with some of their baba ghanoush or hummis.    The seating can be a little weird as they have a rectangular area in the middle where you can end up feeling cramped if the restaurant is full.  Parking can feel the same as it shares a lot with Gilbert Pizza and a few other places.

A top 3 sushi joint in the greater phoenix area and may be tied for #1.  Yasu has yet to disappoint me with anything after a half dozen or so visits.   His level of experimentation and fearless approach to ingredients earns him big points.    If you have never gone "omakase" at a sushi joint before then this should be your first.  It's a slam dunk every time with Yasu and he always gets it together just right.    Only four sushi bar seats so you will likely be at a table.  This is normally a big deal for me because I think sushi should always be eaten at the bar.  Yasu's deals with it better than most and understands the delivery of table-side fish which must be fast.  Still I wish he would whack out the bar divider and expand the sushi bar to a good ten or so.  If you do happen to score the bar, you are in for a great night.     In general the place is warm and inviting.  The lighting is low and I think it's a great place for a date if this is your chow.   Parking can be a bummer and you can certainly drop some coin here if you eat like me... then again I can say that about most sushi joints.  Yasu's may be in the higher end of the cost spectrum though.

Solid food and very good breakfast burritos.  The sausage and egg with Green sauce does it for me every Sunday.  Quality is always the same and the place seems clean and is very well run.  Everything is made to order and I have never had bad food there.  This place is best for take out or a quick meal but do not expect any atmosphere.  It is more cafeteria style feel for a quick in and out.    The drinks/juice they have there is not to my liking.  They are overly sweet for my taste and even my kids.  That is about the only thing I would stay away from.  Go for the food and you will be happy!

A great sushi bar owned and operated by Maggie and Toshi who are both Japanese.  Their product is always consistent and they always have a few good specials.   Service is great and the staff is very friendly and cheerful.  Value is really good particularly within their happy hour menu.      Our kids love it and they are always spoiled rotten by Maggie and Toshi so it is their favorite place.      Lastly we did a sake tasting there a few weeks ago and really had a great time.  We all sat family style int he middle of the restaurant and got to experience some really interesting rice wines.  We had a blast.  Great place

Home of the one hour car wash!  I've been getting my cars washed here for many years just because it is conveniently located right around the corner for me.  Each year they get worse and worse and after my last two washes taking over 50min I am done done.  Save your time and go to a place that cares about your time and how well they clear your car.

Been going to Gilbert pizza ever since they opened. We always have a good experience and great food. They certainly are a lot more popular today than they used to be but they deserve every bit of it.  If you see a Stromboli in the counter make sure to get one particularly their sausage onion and peppers.  It is one of the best things I've had Italian wise the side of the Mississippi.

I just picked up a grinder for $60 less than I could get it online so I am a little jaded.  This is an incredible store and the designer should be winning some kind of reward.  All I can think about as I walk up to store is "this is where I'm coming when the zombies come"  :)  Great selections, good staff, good prices and I've never seen more than two people in line in front of me.  I haven't ventured into the clothing there but I did pass a few specials for great deals.  Great place for kids too.

These guys get it.  I wanted to get my wife's car detailed in a hurry and called Scott on a Friday morning.  I got his VM so I left a message and quickly got a text back saying he would call me in 30min if that worked.  30min later he called and we walked through what I needed done.  Having a rather ordinary car I wanted one of the packages but did not want my engine cleaned so he offered to put a protective coat on the car in replace of the engine cleaning for the same price.  This was great and I appreciated the flexibility so we scheduled for the following day.  Knowing I was in a hurry he called about an hour later indicating he had a cancellation and that he could have his crew over in an hour.  This worked for us and they did a terrific job with  the car.  Two guys spent a full three hours on the vehicle and it looks as good as new.  I really like the tire dressing they used as it does not look wet and will not slop all over the sidewall of the car like many of the car wash shops.  It looks dark and black but not wet and sloppy.  The exterior painted surface feels slicker than ice and seems to be a very good product.  The team that came out were professional, well spoken, and came complete with firm hand shake.  So nice to get 'old school' service today.    Thanks Showcase for some great work.  You deserve your yelp 5 stars and thanks to Yelpers for helping me find you!. I will be sure to reach back when the truck is ready.    .

I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lee's and other shops.    I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.    The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.    Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley.

I have to admit that I got surprised big time tonight.  I've been to La Calabria a few times before with family and they have always been good.  Tonight they blew me away.  I've only had two Italian restaurants blow me away before, tonight at La Calabria and another night at Cucina Urbana in San Diego..  I had the linguini with white clam sauce and my wife had the Pappadelle with mushroom sauce.  Both were made to perfection.  The pasta was al dente and homemade making such a difference.  My clam sauce dish came with a ring of wonderfully sweat clams surrounding the top of the pasta.  The chucks of garlic were large and perfect sized so not to overwhelm the dish.   So many places get this wrong and smash up garlic and overpowering a dish but this was perfect.    The bread was rustic and hard crusted and served with a seasoned Olive OIl that had sun dried tomatoes and herbs.  I used the last of it to sop up the clam sauce that escaped my pasta leaving only a slight indication my plate ever had food on it.    The service was great and the owners were both around to make sure everything was great.    My wife is a first generation Italian and between her and the family, I have always been kept well satisfied with homemade Italian food.  They hold this place in very high regard and now I fully understand why.  They are the ultimate food critics particularly when it comes to Italian and La Calabria gets the nod  every time. .    A tip you may want to consider is to order Gaetano Sambuca with a side of espresso to end the evening. The Sambuca is a lower-proof version and has a perfect mellow flavor to it.

I've found this to be the best sportsbar in the Gilbert/chandler area.  Their burgers are damn good and cooked to the temp that you order them.  The TV's are plenty and they have a good sound system which is great provided what they are focused on is what you are watching.  The service at the bar is always excellent but I cannot comment about the table service.  The bar is big and when full, the tenders always seem to be able to keep up.  The brew selection is good but not great however they do support local which is always a plus.  The place is cleaner than most sports bars and lacks that grimy feel you get at other spots.  Parking sucks for sure due to being in a small lot with several other busy places.  Be prepared to hunt through the odd shaped lots that seem poorly planned.  Overall a solid 4star bar.

Kona Gill bar/patio area Happy Hour = 4 Stars Kona Grill Sushi Restaurant = 2 stars  Sad but this is a great place with an outdoor patio geared for good HH drinks but not sushi. They now have one of the worst quality/price sushi ratios in the valley.    Icing on the cake is  the fact that the only Japanese beer they have is kirin ichiban. which happens to be my least favorite of the major Asian brews .... oh and it was flat.    Kona Grill may be a fine Grill but they should consider sticking with cooked food.    Take your sushi lust elsewhere but if you just want a drink...don't hesitate.

Amazing selection of beers with great tabs educating you on them and often ratings.  Wine and booze selections are great too.  Killer store like candyland for adults.  Prices are excellent and so is service if you need help finding something.  Great place!

I called Eli for the first time to help out with a few jobs I had been dreading.  I needed a new garage door opener installed and I also had a shower that had a steady drip.  Two jobs that I had felt just about anyone would get it right no matter who I hired.  A third job however was to install a new range hood but instead of venting back into the house like my current hood, I wanted it vented outside.  This had me nervous but I decided to go with Eli based on his Yelp reviews.    I have to say that all three jobs were executed perfectly.  He brought the range vent up through my cabinets and into my attic where he went up through the tile roof.  Certainly not a trivial job but the final result looks like it was installed when the house was built.  The venting was taped off perfectly and the holes he drilled perfectly fit the tubing.    He showed up on time to the minute and did a great job cleaning up all of the dust and debris from the cutting and drilling.  The shower cartridge was a 15 year old original so thank god I did not attempt to do that myself.  He ended up having to drill it out as it was locked in tight.    I am really happy with the all of the work and he and his co-worker were respectful of my home and I felt very comfortable with them in my home.  I work from home and I'm on the phone most of the day and hardly felt like they were there.  I will certainly use them again.

Very cool place nestled inside an older house where you dine in the living room, dining room and a bar area set off to the side.  It has a relaxing feel like you're hanging at a buddies house and the lighting is just perfect.  The music yesterday was unfortunately all over the place from rap to older musical icons but it was generally good.  I just don't like rap but that is a personal choice.  It might also be a bit loud for some as it was for me but only when more rap like tunes were on so again perhaps it is just my tastes.  As the evening progressed the music seemed to mellow a bit which was welcome but happy hour times seem to be a little too "in yo face" for me.  I've been here three times and usually gravitate to the BLT which has the best bacon on it I've ever had.  It is almost more like a soft jerky than bacon and the flavor of the sandwich is sublime.  The menu is quite diverse and everything is reasonably priced and well portioned.  I was not able to finish my BLT and I am a pretty big eater.    I found a new beer which was Stone's Delicious IPA which is aptly named.  Wow this is a good brew and unlike many of the Stone brews, does not knock you upside the head with a truckload of intense flavor.  It is well balanced IPA similar to a Deschutes fresh squeezed ipa or a Green Flash IPA.  Terrific!!!  Service was good though I have been outside when it was a little slow.  The bartender was on top of everything which was where we dined last night.  Parking can be a little crowded but considering the area there really are no solutions.  Overall a very cool place with a great vibe.

Very poor service and their tacos tasted like corn tortillas.  You had to load them up with salsa for flavor.  Salsa selection is nice as in the patio seating.  Makes sense for happy hour but the beer i had from the tap was pretty flat.  Really not much good to reference here except the salsas.  Unfortunately that is not something you can build a restaurant on.

4.5 star for certain!    Man I really like this place.  I dined there for the first time with my family this evening and none of us were disappointed at all.  The noodles are very good and have a lot of texture to them.  The broth that they used in the soups was very flavorful but not greasy or oily.  It felt really healthy and fresh.  The cooks were making noodles in the back and it is very entertaining to watch.  There smoothies are freaking wonderful!  I would however shy away from the tapioca balls unless you know you like them.  They are pretty gummy and do not dissipate or melt in your mouth like I expected.  . We also had an order of pan fried pot stickers which is one of my favorites and these were the best I have ever eaten.  The dough was perfect, light, crispy, yet moist.  The filling was very meaty and had nice flavors of lemongrass and ginger.  The sauce was excellent as well - lighter than most butt this is good in this case.    I am very excited to have found my new lunch and dinner place.  The bill for a family of four was $40 and that included three smoothies, four entrees, and a large app of pot stickers.    The setting in the only drawback but as a foodie I do not go to places often for ambiance.  It is clean and the kitchen is visibly clean as well which is great to see. The service was efficient and and prompt.  I swear they will get you your food faster than Mc-E-D's which just adds to the place when dining for lunch when you only have an hour to burn.  Go, and enjoy it!

First time last night at the Indian Oven after searching high and low for some good Indian that rivals what I get in England when I travel there.  I like this place a lot!  It lacks a lot of the dark tablecloth and somewhat dreary feel you get in many of the places in town.  The restaurant appears clean and the service is exceptional.  We had a steady flow of nan which was cooked perfectly and had great texture.  I got a Taj Mahal beer which was served with a deeply frosted mug.  When ice cold this is an exceptional beer as is the slightly lighter bodied Kingfisher.    The buffet is great and offers dishes divided between meat-based and vegetarian which is cool if you are not familiar with the dishes.  They had a lamb vindaloo that had great flavor but lacked some of the heat I am used to with vindaloo dishes.  I did hear the table next to me comment on how spicy it was so perhaps this is just my tastes and preference.    All of the dishes I had were excellent.  The basmati rice was served out of a rice cooker which seemed a little off considering everything else was is long pans.  The lamb was a little dry perhaps because it was slightly over cooked?  All of the chicken dishes were exceptional as we're the veggie.  I also ordered a side of papadum which are great if you have kids.  They did not serve it with the traditional spicy chutney I am used to though but they did nail the green cilantro based sauce.  I few of my pet peeves that this place passed on was perfectly filtered Arizona water.  No chemical or hard water flavors so they must have a good RO system.  The other was that when the bill was delivered they kept filling waters and asked us if they could get us anything until we left which again speaks to their high level of service.    The wait staff were dressed neatly and groomed to the extent that I wondered how I could get my facial hair so tight.  A great night and experience and I look forward to my next visit.

Artie get's my business from here out.  Amazing speed and efficiency in getting a leaky disposal fixed that had caused a serious mold issue under my kitchen sink.  He was very straightforward and you know when you are dealing with an honest person.  His prices are good as is his level of professionalism.  He even wore shoe covers before entering the house which is not something I have seen in a long time.  Thanks Artie for fixing our issue and the great service.

Nice and very clean shop.  Seems owner operated which is always good to see.  Subs have great flavor and getting them toasted is best.  Good bread but not great although I have yet to find great bread in Arizona.  The only down side to this place is that they do not put a lot of meat on their subs in relation to other shops.

We had a wonderful meal here with another couple.  It was our first time so we were a little uncertain on what to order or how much.  We ended up taking a lot of suggestions from the waiter who was well versed in the options.  It is BYOB so we brought our own beer which was a good match with the food.  We did the half and half with the Lemongrass broth on one side and the ying/yang on the other.  We all loved both.  We did a variety of meats (Lamb and beef) as well as some squid.  Beautiful mushroom options and bok choi and a few other veggies.  All four of us left perfectly full and the bill came in under $60.  I saw a few other yelpers mention it was way overpriced and the broth was unflavored.  A mystery to me.    The atmosphere is nice and cool lighting and contemporary style is a real nice touch considering the strip mall area it is in.  The only down side I experienced is a stormy night produced a pretty nasty leak in the men's room.  They said they were renovating in a few days so I hope that is something they catch.    All is all it is a great concept and a great product.  The service is excellent as well.  Bring some beer and go have some fun with a group.

Can't say enough about how great Ryken is.  We have grown up with them since our kids were very young.  It just keeps getting better and better and always improving their services and layout.    The other day our daughter popped out her first and second RIB and was miserable.  She complained about her shoulder though so it really threw us off.  Unlike Urgent care who wanted her to Ice and take pills, Dr Ryan picked up on what was wrong right away.  A few pops later and my daughter was so relieved.    I've been going to chiropractors since I was a young kid and Ryken is by far the best of the best.  They care and take time with patients which is rare these days.

Good product but took over 30min to get a burger on a sat that was not that busy.  Its as if they have no idea that they are about to sell another burger at 6:30pm.

I think this is the best wine bar in the east valley.  They have a cool patio and inside a few comfy couches by a fireplace.  They give you a free cheese or meat board with a bottle of wine so i rarely need to order any food.  Prices are good and so is service.  Great place for a romantic evening or a few wine-o friends.  I have not had much food there but the free (with bottle order) cheese plates and charcuterie boards are more than enough for me to eat.  If you are not a wine person they also have some real nice beers on the menu including one of my favorites, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale.  Good to see them support their local breweries.

Postinos really has a few things nailed down well:  - Price: I think it is Monday and Tuesday that you can get a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 !!!.  The wine is not panther piss either and actually quite good so I challenge you to beat that deal.  - Style:  No matter where you are seated, you feel the great vibe and it's a great place to chill with a group of friends.  - Diversity:  Great bar area, lounge area, outdoor area, grass (fake) area with adirondack style chairs, and street view.    - Quality:  The food is always pretty darn good.  I tend to drink more than I eat here and also never get disappointed by the beer selection.  My wife loves their "house" reds too.  On the down side some of the areas can feel a little cramped.  Some of the tables in the middle of the dining room feel right on top of others.  It is also always busy which though fun can be a bummer if you are trying to find a spot.  You almost have to have a plan of attack on a weekend to get some good digs.  If you haven't been, I'd suggest hitting it on off times or mid week and I'm certain you will enjoy it.  If Yelp supported half stars this would surely get a 4.5.    Great to see another quality anchor for the DT Gilbert scene.

This place was a great surprise.  We did an early 5pm dinner and the family all went for the buffet.  The food was some of the better indian i have had in AZ.  The place is clean and the service with drinks and naan were great.  One tv had bollywood action and the other had cricket.  Despite not being fancy i found it a nice change over the traditional indian decor.  They had my two favorite indian brews, kingfisher and taj mahal.  Both are great if you have never had them.  We will go back again for sure.

I've been pretty stingy with giving out five stars to higher end restaurants but last night Crudo came through in a big way.  We wanted to try something new and the idea of small plates sounded perfect.  I'd rather try a bunch of smaller portions than a single large entree any day.  Maybe this is why I like sushi so much.    We arrived earlier than or reservation yet the hostess was very warm and welcoming and indicated we could be seated right away or enjoy a drink at the bar.  We chose the later and really liked the bar vibe.  It had a farmhouse industrial feel to it and all of the spacing and seating were just right.  The bar was staffed with true mixologists making some pretty complex and wonderful cocktails.  They had great cubes with the cocktails which is something often overlooked.  Despite being busy, when we walked back up to the hostess she picked right up on us asked us if we enjoyed the bar then guided us to our seat.  She also gave us an option of seating which I just loved.  (The Service was starting to impress at this point)  Inside the restaurant we both went for the 4 plates for $45 and skipped the desert.  I added in a side of Crispy Pig Ears on recommendation from a buddy of mine which may have been the world's easiest sell ever.  I'm such a sucker when I see something like that on the menu - add in the crispy pork factor and I'm locked.  My buddy was spot on and the dish was sublime.  The ears had great crispy texture and were in a sweet vinegar and pickled red peppers with just the right amount of heat.  Balancing this dish out with the ingredients in there is not something I underestimate which brings me to my tip #1 - Get the side of pig ears!  As the evening continued, the exquisite control and balance between flavors, color and texture kept resurfacing.  Crudo gets this so well and is up there with the best of the best regardless of city.   The main plates then began to come out thoughtfully ordered from light to rich and savory.  Raw fish led with very nice Butterfish and Yellowtail.  Both were fresh and very well balanced.  It is amazing the touches just a few very small pieces of Lardo can add to the Butterfish while not overwhelming such a delicate flavor.    Next came the Burrata Pancetta which was simply perfect.  If you are like me and never tried this cheese before, it's a more gooey mozzarella that is mixed with some cream.  The result is insane particularity when paired with a great hard crusted bread and Arugula.  Tip #2 - get this dish!  Between the two of us we then moved into the Mushroom Gratin and the Risotto with squid ink.  Both were hearty and had more of a "comfort food" feeling to them than the other dishes.  The Mushrooms in the gratin were al dente and though I love my veggies like this, I would prefer the woody shrooms to be softened just a bit more.  Flavors on both dishes were excellent and the small chucks of Tuna in the Risotto were just the right add to the light brine and sea flavor of the squid ink.    Last up were the short rib and the Pork Belly.  This is where I have to stop and give special mention to the Polenta served with the Pork Belly.  I've had Polenta many many many times and this was by far in its own category.  Light and more fluffy with amazing texture and true flavors of fresh picked farm corn.  I could fill a tub with this stuff and just sit in it all day.  It made me so damn happy and would come back for this alone.  The Short Rib was melt in your mouth tender and very well prepared.    Our waiter was exceptional and understood the oh so rare talent of giving you your privacy yet accommodating every need before you have it. Water was always full as were our cocktails.  Dishes were ordered and timed perfectly having just the right pause in between.  New silverware, timely cleaning and clearing not to mention opening the hallway door to the restroom for my wife.  Yep - Crudo knocked the service bit out of the park.    The only negatives I can recount were a cramped and busy parking lot, and of all things, their water was not well filtered.  Seems like such an obvious miss to me but so many places get this wrong.  I ended up ordering bottled water with dinner which interestingly enough was a French sourced rather than Italian such as Pellegrino.  it was very nice though particularly the gassed option.

Best year to date helped along by the great weather and the Dry River Yacht Club who killed it.  It was my first time seeing them and they were really groovy, creative, fun, and talented.  Really a Bassoon player??  :)  The beer vendors were exceptional as always welcoming discussion and good pours.  The value for the overall festival is amazing considering everything is paid for up front with the exception of food which you get from the trucks.    Many of the top notch breweries were represented including Ballast Point , Marble, Santa Fe Brewing, Ska, Firestone, and many more.  For $35 it was a great deal and I never waited in a line more than two deep.    Bathrooms were always available and the general vibe was relaxed and chill.  Great job Ameri-CAN and I will be back year after year!

Great pub with a solid beer selection and great service.  We were there lunch time on a sat when it was pretty quiet but the bartender was great and we always had a full glass.  The burgers and fried where great and they have a blue cheese bacon sauce for dipping and burger that rocks.  The handles included some favorites from Bels, left hand, firestone, and locals from four peaks.  Warm vibe with lots of wood and clean industrial lines.  Would definitely place them a notch above the other bars on the mill strip

Checked out the Dry River Yacht Club and Diego's Umbrella last night and had a real good time.  LEL is certainly in the dive bar category with low light and that slightly rundown feel but it works very well for a music venue.  The staff is excellent and actually take the time to talk with you and the solo bartender handled the bar like a pro by himself with a lot of people.  I never waited (though I tip good :) ) for a drink and I have not seen a bartender move like that since I lived in NY/NJ area.  The doorman was cool and was great to talk to on the way out.  The stage though small fit a good six pieces up there and the sound was very very good for such a small room.  If you get a chance to see a show here you will be very happy with the sound.    The crowd was cool and diverse though I suspect that was more to do with the bands than the bar.  I will certainly keep my eyes open for future events here and would love to see more $10 shows like last night.  I have so much more fun than the big venues that are asking for ridiculous amounts of money.

Amazing service in this place as it is owner operated.  I also loved their spring rolls which I could make a meal out of alone.  Their Pho Ga was a little on the bland side I found sadly otherwise I would be there all the time.  The rest of the food we had was very good and very fresh.  This place cares about their food and their customers.

Cool place - great name!  I've been there a few times and had a great experience on both.  The service was very good the second time likely due to the manager? who gladly rolled up her sleeves and helped out with everything.  I spent more than a decade in the restaurant biz and I really like the way she runs the floor and talks with guests.  Yeah OK and she's cute too!  :)  The first time I just drank at the bar and service is always top notch with Chris who I have seen at a few other places in the valley.  He is a professional bartender for sure.  I like the décor and love the fact that they planted desert cactus and succulents outside rather than the typical landscape mix in AZ.  Nice job to the designer there.  The art and materials inside are also pretty cool.  I'm tempted to drop a star because the food is a little pricey as mentioned in some of the other reviews and the chips and salsa are average and could use some work.  I'd also like to see more awareness of specials which we had to discover.    The place is busy so be careful about showing up with a big party.

Looks like there are a few people that had a negative experience here but my first experience the other night was a good one.  The place has a neighborhood sports bar feel to it but lacks a little bit in terms of identity.  There is a collection of Boston area sports memorabilia hanging in one spot but not much in the way of local team stuff.  The TV's are plenty and unless you are ultra picky I don't understand how you could not watch what you want to see.  The beer list is better than most and I had a coffee stout there that was excellent.  I only sampled the Mac and Cheese there which is made with a smoked Gouda and happened to be one of the best I've had and the french dip which was excellent.  A few of my buddies tried the steak and burger and were also very happy.  The owners were involved and hooked us up with some additional sides after talking to them a bit which was very nice.  I thought the prices were just fine but then again many people benchmark against the big chain restaurants which I refuse to support so I lack context there.  I will certainly be back.

What is the same from my first review?    - They still have excellent brews and they love to experiment to always keep you interested.  - They still get slammed frequently - go on off hours - Their food is still damn good  What has changed: - They have an outdoor area including a tasting room - They changed the way their doors work.  Get in through the outdoor patio area - They now keep up with demand and always have several great brews to choose from - They have misters and shade in the outdoor area including a tasting room.  Thanks due to the bagel place going under that they were attached to. - Their men's bathroom is entering "dive bar" territory.  Not quite Trainspotting but getting close. - They now have a group of hostesses that are quite frankly horrible.  Not only are they unfriendly but they could easily run the place about 30% more efficient than they do.  We got yelled at for sitting at an outdoor table with other people (who were already seated) three times.  Here is a tip ladies - let the biergarten flow.  Allow the outside area to be first come first serve. It will encourage people to sit with strangers which is good for the vibe.  Control the inside tables only because it is obvious you cannot do both.  I've never seen so many people get yelled at while tables sat empty for over an hour.  If you are trying to slow the place down so service can catch up there are better ways to do that.    Last up is the tasting room service.  The line moves slower than pond water and there is usually one person in there solo.  This is not good and I feel so bad for the poor guy trying to score a quick growler and go home.  Get a person to pour tasters, one to take cash/credit, and the other to deal with a SEPARATE growler line.  These are profitable sales (growlers) that don't take up space in your busy restaurant area so you should encourage them.

Man the food here is soooo good.  I am in love with their Stromboli and think the sausage and pepper is supreme.  The layout is a little cluttered on the inside but when the weather warms up a bit they have a nice outside section.   The staff is friendly and nice to see owners in the operation.  The pizza is best ordered by the slide as you will get that perfect crispiness vs. the standard flabby droop you find in most places.   They nail their marinara sauce with just the right balance of acidity and sweetness.  The cheese they use is top notch and produces little oil when heated.  Great flavor too!  We will certainly be back and between this place and Gilbert Pizza I really do not feel the need to venture out further in this area.

The Perch did a 'soft opening' on Valentine's day which was pretty cool.  We got their early knowing it would get crowded and got some great seats.  We started on the roof which is set up nicely but unfortunately there were issues with the bar varnish? and so they had some plastic over it.  There were some other great spots to hang upstairs but we saw they only had four taps up top.  We then sat downstairs near the bar and really enjoyed the vibe of the place.  We met tons of nice people, many of which were from the brewing arena.  We also got to take a great tour of the new brew equipment in the side yard area with all new beautiful stainless equipment that soon they should have up and running.  Though they are not brewing onsite yet, the handles on the wall will not disappoint.  They did a great job selecting beers with everything from Sex Panther to fruit infused brews to hard ciders to Chimay,  The food was OK but needs some work.  I was not a fan of the pizzas due to the dough they used and the beer sausage was dry and grainy.  The Green Chili Pork Torta was pretty darn good though. For an opening night I was most impressed with the service.  THEY GOT SLAMMED and packed to the gills quickly and instead of it feeling chaotic and frenzied, there was just a fun busy feeling to it.  My drink was never empty and everything came quickly.  The open courtyard area is done very well and the rescued birds that are there are fun and certainly thoughtfully placed considering it is a food establishment.  About the only thing wrong with the layout is the need for more bathrooms.  Looking forward to heading back to this place when a few kinks are ironed out.  Kudos to them for a great opener.

FINALLY I found a new Pho place!  After years of searching hi and low for a new Pho place I have found it.  I used to be a regular at Saigon Pho but after several bad bad experiences in a row I began my search.  Chandler Pho, Pho Nat, Pho Van, unPhogettable, and several others just did not have the flavor I was used to.    Pho Viet Nam has very good broth in their Pho Ga and the chicken was all very good white meat.  The broth had just the right amount of flavors and spices and the noodles we cooked perfectly.  The team was nice and mellow and the spring rolls were excellent.  I had them with Shrimp and Pork.    Unlike many of the aforementioned restaurants, Pho Viet Nam was nice and clean and the table had all of the needed accoutrement.  Service was very good with food arriving very quickly.  Looking to go back soon!

I am so happy to finally have a seafood place here in the East Valley.  High Tide gets a few things VERY right.  Let's start off with the beer selection featuring Green Flash IPA, Firestone Walker DBA and IPA and several other selections from Stone and other top notch breweries.  Next up are the oysters which are fresh and shucked very well.  They usually try and carry an East and West coast oyster which is cool to split and taste the amazing variety.  I'm a huge fan of their quality and they are served correctly with lemon and three sauces based on your taste.  A cocktail with a huge chunk of fresh horseradish, a shallot vinaigrette, and a creamy horseradish.  I just use the chunk horseradish and lemon and it is wonderful.  .    The other day I had a dz raw oysters and an oyster poboy which was also amazing.  A little heavy on the bread but the oysters and the pickles etc were spot on.  The fried okra was a nice add and something I have not seen in restaurants in years.    The prices are reasonable considering the size of the place and the high level of freshness they provide in the food.  This brings me to the only possible negative which is a lack of warmth in the restaurant.  Perhaps they just need some plants and filler but it is a large open space with high ceilings and you feel somewhat like you are at a museum.  The booths seem a little too "old school" for me but no matter because I think the huge bar is the only place to sit.  You can also watch them make some of the foods in very cool steam pots they have right there in the bar.    Service is a notch above most with staff that are well educated and a little more mature than you would normally find in a AZ restaurant.  Service usually shines here from people with a deep understanding of the food and drink.  Lastly they need a bike rack outside being right in the center of town.  It's an easy ride for many within the area and they have a huge windowed area where people can keep an eye on things.  Would love to cruise over for some oysters and beer and dash home without putting a key in the car.  I hope to see one by the time fall arrives.    Nice work High Tide!

wow this place so deserves a 4.5 rating.  It is well designed and decorated and you can feel comfortable dressed either casual or well.  They give you a nice warm towel when you sit down which is a great touch. Service is exceptional (reception and table-side) and the ratio of staff to customer is perhaps the best i've seen in a reasonably priced restaurant.    If you are looking for a place to take the lady I think most will love the vibe here and it will feel like "a date night."  Though Nori is more or less a strip mall, once inside and you are in another world that feels contemporary, clean and rich.  Steady grooves of Thievery Corp and Nightmares on Wax sneak around all night at just the right volume.  Great lounge vibe.  Sake is served elegantly and correctly in a wooden box and mine had an integrated ice compartment to keep my sake cold.  Sweet!  The fish quality is very good.  They had bluefin toro a few of the nights I've been there and it was old school good.  They also seem to consistently have fresh Saba and fry the bones correctly afterwards.  Their presentation wows you every time and they have great plate ware and garnishes.    All of the sashimi as very fresh and high qualify right up there with some of the best.  On the down side I would say that I typically enjoy talking to the sushi chef and interacting on and off throughout the night but there is not a lot to work with here.  They are a little indifferent and a little too serious.  If this was a language barrier than my bad but  I didn't detect that in our limited interaction.  They do certainly know sushi so this is a minor gripe.    Kanpai

I've been here a few times now and BQ has the right vibe, great outdoor dining, and solid food and bev.  It's another one of those "I wish I could give it 4.5 stars" deal.  I also have to admit that the hardest food critics in the entire freaking world are the people from AZ and NM who are eating at a Mexican restaurant.  Consider this in their rating.    I've cycled through many of the tacos and the Cochinita Pibil, Camaron, and Al Pastor are all damn good.  If I had to choose my favorite I would say it would be the Cochinita Pibil with those amazing pickled onions.  The tacos are small for sure but the 3 for $10 is not too bad  considering the freshness and quality of the ingredients.  The shrimp is perfect with some of the best texture and flavor I've found.  The drinks are well poured and the house margarita is always spot on.  Their tequilas selection is impressive and vast and I hope to dive into it some day.  Sadly my taste for tequila was tragically altered for what seems to be forever after one ridiculous night in my younger years.    The 1=point drop on BQ was due to the service being average, not excellent and our table had a bad wobble outside on the patio.  In general they could use an upgrade to the 2 and 4-tops on the patio.  It might be intentional to help "turn" more tables but the seats are uncomfortable and I feel like an over sized wookiee on them.     If you have a larger party however there is a bad ass fireplace table outside that I recall seating about 8 ppl.  If you nail it, you will most definitely feel like "the man"..... or woman I suppose.  Enjoy!

I've been to Crust twice now and both times have been happy.  Their beer selection is good but not great.  They could certainly use a little more variety but they do offer several local selections.    As for the food I've only had two items.  The garlic knots which are good and the ever so amazing arugula and prosciutto pizza to which I add a side of burrata cheese.  Yes this pie is sublime.  Perhaps the best pizza I've had in a decade or so.  While pizza is such an individual preference this pie has a lot going for it that should make most happy.  First the ingredients are top notch.  The arugula is fresh and wonderful.  The prosciutto is not cooked with the pie leaving the flavor and texture intact.  The crust is firm, yeasty with just the right amount of salt.  The sauce is excellent and does not overwhelm the pie nor inject too much acid int the equation.  Yes my fellow Yelpers.... you must give this thing a try as it is a work of culinary art.    As for the location, parking is always a bit of a challenge.  Just dirt lot it and take a hike otherwise you will drive around like a jackass.  Note the back road behind Santan Brewery and this place is under construction making things even harder. if you know your way around.  The patio is pretty well set up and there is open air dining all around the place.  Great location for good weather dining.  Service is good but not great.  Our first experience was pretty slow despite it being relatively empty.  The second on the patio was better.  Looking forward to returning regardless and after a bit of tuning see this place as a 5 star contender.

Rolled in pretty late last night which I hate to do to restaurants as I always hated that when I worked in the biz.  Instead of sighs or body language of disappointment, my friend and I were warmly greeted.   We sat at the Sushi bar and soon found out we were sitting next to Jennifer who is mentioned in many of the reviews.  Her friend was with her as well and we really enjoyed their company and conversation.  That after all is a big part of the sushi bar experience and exactly why I always sit at the bar.    The food was excellent and they guided me to a few things I never do.  One was put spice and mayo on my scallops but it ended up being very good.  They also offered some samples to taste including a Saba that they pickle/marinate inhouse.  It was less oily than most and certainly more enjoyable.    The Yellowtail sashimi was very good as were the salmon and tuna.  Typically Uni is hit or miss in Arizona but on a Wed this place had very fresh Uni and when paired with quail egg was luxurious and worth the trip alone.    Can't say enough about the sweet people here and the good food.  Looking forward to more experiences and exploring the menu a bit more.

Nice place!  Went here for lunch today and had a pretty solid meal.  I love how clean and well organized the place is.  It has an industrial feel with lots of stainless and high ceilings.  Everything is impeccably clean and new looking giving the place a great vibe. Bathrooms were also clean and have touchless towels which always scores points with me.  Comfortable seating and great staff that actually seem like they enjoy working there.  I had a Cuban Panini that was pretty good and a bowl of roasted pepper and lobster bisque soup that was flavored well.  Prices we fair and a chocolate strawberry was a nice touch.  I was asked if I wanted croutons in my soup "for extra" which seams silly.  A crouton is a lightly seasoned piece of stale bread which has to be one of the cheapest items in the kitchen so this was a little "off" given their theme and price point.    All in all a solid lunch spot that I prefer to Paradise which is just next door.

I've been here a dozen or so times and find it becoming one of my favorite places to chill.  The vibe is just right and it steps things up a notch in the quality and service department.   The staff is great and I particularly love it when we have Ashley taking care of us.  She "get's it", remembers what you like to eat and drink, and has a great relaxed and natural style to her.  Bobby who is always mixing up some wonderful cocktails has also floored a few of the friends I've brought there.  Great to see the revival of the professional bartender going down in a few good places nearby.  Crudo in DT Phx and the Brickyard are leading the charge IMO.    I also love the idea of the Brickyard's small plates.  Why eat a lot of one thing when you can graze around and taste lots of stuff.  Their mix on food is diverse and I always down a few orders of shishito peppers which apart from one of my sushi joints, can't be found.  The  Grilled octopus,  Artichokes, Gyoza, and olives served warm are all very good.  I'd love to see them incorporate a few specials floating in and out in the future.  The place is new and always clean including the bathrooms which are solo with a locked door which is always nice. The music is good and lively but if you go there a lot it can begin to wear down on you.  I'd love to hear some new mixes floating in... perhaps some Thievery Corporation or maybe even Bitter:Sweet to keep the theme.  The owner Gavin is always involved and is a roll up the sleeves type guy who happily gets his hands dirty.  He's the kind of owner you route for to do well because of it and of course his staff.  Prices are a little higher than most but people need to understand what it takes to hire and maintain high quality people in the AZ restaurant scene, sit in that DTC location, serve high end ingredients and booze, and build out from scratch.    The Brickyard has done an excellent job and is must visit if you are a foodie or like high quality spirits.  Enjoy!

I went today to the soft opening understanding that things would be pretty rough.  When we arrived there were three tables (a 3, 4, and 2 top) already seated and was told by one of the workers there that it would be slow because the staff was not there yet.  I saw that the soft opening began at 11am through the evening so I said no problem but asked how this afternoon went.  He indicated that they did not open as planned due to issues with their systems.    I planned for the roughness by going at 4:15pm and was happy to be there before just about anyone else and was real fired up for some noodles.  The menu is solid and they have a lot of interesting items.  I went for one of the specials called the house black.  I also ordered a beer and was pleased to find the usual Japanese suspects - Kirin, Sapporo, Ichiban, etc. The waiter then proceeded to walk around rather aimlessly and I ended up waiting about 15min for my beer when there was only three tables.  People started flowing in and all I could think of was "this place is about to get its ass handed to it."  I could just feel it.  As folks started rolling in I saw the staff also roll in between 4:48 and the last at 5:05pm.  While they had a good amount of staff, you don't start opening night by rolling in as or mostly after the customers do.  Again I was patient and ready for a long wait for my food.    Soon the place was full with every seat taken yet only one table had food and only a few had drinks.  The staff seemed to huddle in the kitchen are waiting for food rather than offering  drinks and food was just not coming out of the kitchen.  A few more cooks rolled in with big smiles seeing the number of people there.  They got behind the line and started working on food.  Table 1 and 2 had their food at this point but I saw they brought the wrong food to #3.  They then wandered around the place asking anyone if they ordered the dish they had in hand.  Nobody claimed it so it went back to the kitchen.  One dish came out at a time after that with no cadence of serving a whole table.  At the 45min mark I decided I would stay calm and give them a full hour to get me my food given we were early and the 4th table there.  That time went and past as I watched countless people walk out finally giving up.  I feel bad as it was a soft opening but there is getting overwhelmed and working through problem and then there is not even being in the game.  I mean who shows up for opening night after a majority of the guests?  What kind of planning went into this?  Ever think about talking and apologizing to your guests?  How about buying someone a beer or cheap sake?  An order of dumplings after 50min without food?  You failed on every level and I sure hope you pull it together. Seems to me like this place is a dream of someone who has money but no restaurant experience.  Hire a professional and get some help before you lose a lot of interested people.
