If you want to have a nice conversation over dinner, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for quality pizza, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a place with some very unique entertainment to accompany some not-so-great pizza, than this is the place to go.  I love the entertainment.  The restaurant is built around the largest Wurlitzer theater pipe organ in the world (Almost 6,000 Pipes!). The organ controls violins, drums, horns, xylophones, and many other special effects hanging on the walls of the restaurant.  The music is a lot of fun. The organist plays movie scores, TV theme songs, Disney songs, Broadway hits, patriotic songs, and even takes requests!  Don't expect to be able to have a normal conversation since the noise is high volume.  The food is nothing special, so don't go expecting that and you won't leave disappointed.

You might be in a mom & pop joint when there are employees under the age of 16.  I think one of the girls was like 13.  These guys know how to do business!  They are very friendly and when we had a problem with getting our order they gave me my money back without me complaining.  That made me want to go back before I even ate.  I got the mix plate 4 - Teriyaki Chicken and Katsu combination.  I liked the Teriyaki more.  I'd choose this place over Moki's, but I haven't tried any other Hawaiian places yet.

I'd give this place 4.8 stars, but only because there is nothing special about the atmosphere, it's really plain.  Other than that it's perfect.  The only thing I've ever ordered there is the calzones, because they are amazing.  I've heard from others that everything is great though, especially the pizza muffins and the bazooki dessert.  Being a calzone fan, whenever I go to a restaurant that has calzones, that's what I will get.  Floridinos' calzones tie for rank number one currently, and I've had calzones from about 10 different restaurants.  These ones are really big!  This time I got a ham, pineapple, and ricotta calzone.  I can usually tell the food is great when I close my eyes while eating it because it is so good.  My friends say it looks like I am making out with my food.  The service was great and quick, I was surprised at how quickly they brought our meals out, and I was in a group of 8 (That said, it was around closing time so they had less customers and probably wanted to get rid of us...something that can be advantageous at most restaurants).  Also, they have a lot more space as they recently added 2 good-sized rooms.  You can't beat the prices here either.  I got my 3-topping giant calzone for less than 8 bucks I think.  A very friendly and attentive wait staff.  Insider's Tip: They have some amazing lunch specials, Mon-Fri, 11-2.  The best is a 2-item calzone with a drink, only $5.75.

Baja Fresh is going down hill.  The burrito size is shrinking, and the price  is growing!  WTF!  Did they think I wouldn't notice?  I still like their burritos, I just don't think it's worth it now.  I can get a much more filling burrito from my friends at Chipotle for less $.  Oh and I normally like mango salsa but this time theirs tasted like dookie.

With $1.00, I can either get 4 gum balls from the gum ball machine at the mall, or choose an item from the plethora found on Wendy's value menu.  I rarely choose the gum balls.  I give Wendy's 5 stars because in my opinion it is everything you could ask for in a fast food joint: Value, friendliness, and most importantly, speed.  I like to play a game called 'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that's fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called 'Don't come to a complete stop when picking up my food'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a "Thank you" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said "have a good day!"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy's almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.   I never expect gourmet from Wendy's, especially from the dollar menu, but it's good food and definitely worth it, especially the decadent frosty.  The only complaint I would have is that the first-window girl was not hot like the second-window girl.

I  have to admit that fourth star may have been added for the memories factor.  Back in high school this was a place we'd go to when we ditched.  I like the pizza a lot.  The last time I went we had a group of 24 and we had a back room all to ourselves and pushed all the tables together so they were very accommodating there.  I was a little disappointed they wouldn't let us split the bill up how we wanted, but it's understandable with so many people.  I'd say this is a pretty good chill date place.

I never walk into a drug store expecting something spectacular, because you'll never really get that.  It satisfied all of my needs, which was to stuff my utility pockets with movie treats like Whoppers and Hot Tamales, at drugstore price instead of movie theater price, before seeing Dark Knight.    I feel that this location is more ghetto than others.  It seems like there is always at least one shady person hanging out outside the door.  Kind of reminds me of the feeling I have whenever I'm at a Circle K.  This location is the closest drug store so I go frequently, but I don't recommend going out of your way to make it to this one.   When I walked in I noticed out of the corner of my eye that there was a new employee that I hadn't seen before, and it was a girl that might have been attractive.  But then when I checked out I realized it was a guy with long hair!!  Gross !  Reminds me of the time my friend told me he used to have a crush on one of Hansen before he found out they were boys....awkward!!!

Now I know why all the Ethiopians are starving!  I would be starving too if this is all I had to eat!  I guess maybe it's just not my thing, since all the other reviews are mostly positive, though in my group of 9 not a single person liked the food (maybe the not liking it was contagious).  I will say that the interesting atmosphere and food did make for an interesting experience.  I wasn't a big fan of the injera (flat bread), it was like a sock.  I had a sampler plate.  The portions were enough for an 8-year old, and some of the dishes looked like barf.  For me, the food wasn't gross, but it was nothing special for my tastes buds.  If you like trying new things, it's not a bad idea to give this place a try.

'Which buffets should I go to while visiting the Las Vegas strip?'  It's the question that haunts all of us and never seems to escape our nightmares.  Well one of the answers for me is the MGM buffet.  I have heard the Bellagio, Aladdin, and Rio are the best, but you will be paying more there.  I have been to several other buffets on the strip and the MGM has been my favorite because of the value.  Our waiter was a little slow to clear our plates and refill our drinks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.  They have some of everything, which I guess would be expected at any decent buffet, but these guys seem to have it all.  Best chile relleno I've ever had in my life, really good cr√®me brulee, and many types of cheesecakes among an incredible dessert selection.  For breakfast they do made-to-order omelettes, and at night cooked-to-order steak.  For dinner they Alaskan King Crab Legs, and the list could go on forever of course, but I sure did feel like I was at Disneyland when I noticed the stack of Cracker Jacks!  That made it really special for me.  Check their website listed here for the hours of lunch and dinner, and a highlight of the menu.  Tip 1: Using a duffel bag as seen in the movie Vegas Vacation  is not permitted at this buffet. Tip 2: Make it for lunch (until 2:30) and it's $10 cheaper ($20 for lunch, $30 for dinner)

I was excited to come back to this place before I even sat down at my table.  It's a small place and it was crowded, yet we didn't have to wait to be seated.  I think we got the last open table.  The two brothers were awesome.  They are super friendly and joke a lot and their accents let you know you're in for an authentic Italian meal.  I was waiting the entire time for one of the guys to say, "Itsa mee, Mario!"   The prices are very fair.  I ordered the 10-inch white pizza with spinach and It was $9 I think.   It's thin crust with mozzarella and  chunks of ricotta. Holy schnike it was so divine!  It very well could be the best pizza I've ever had.  The wait time to receive our meals was what I would have expected.  I was in a group of 6 and everyone ordered something different, including pastas and other pizzas, and they all loved it.  I will be returning to this place to try the other dishes soon.  Tip:  Try the white pizza!

I'd actually give these guys 4.5 stars.  The number one reason this place beats all the other theaters is the lack of a crowd.  I just went to a movie on opening day - I arrived less than 30 minutes before show time, and still got an excellent seat.  Now, I don't know how long this will last as the main reason it is probably not so busy is the surrounding shops are not opened up yet, but it has been this way for a couple years now.  One night I tried going to a big movie on opening night at Tempe Marketplace and there was just no way, we got there super early and everything was sold out.  We went down the street to Cinemark and it was a ghost town.  I just don't understand.  These guys are cheaper, has a very nice and new feeling and atmosphere, and the auditoriums are always perfect temperature for me, whereas the Harkins are almost always too warm.

I have been going to this location for about 2 years.  I have visited 3 other locations, and seen the outsides of many.  This one is by far the most ghetto one of them all.  It is very basic as far as the equipment, but they do have the essentials.  It's just not as neat or clean as the other locations I've been to.  They need to do some remodeling or something, I'm pretty sure this one is one of the oldest in the valley.  I have also noticed that sometimes a machine will be 'Out of Order' for more than a week, one time it was about three weeks.  They do offer a variety of fitness classes but I imagine they have that at most locations.  If you are nearby this may be convenient, but if you are in the middle of this and another LA fitness, go to the other, I guarantee it will be better.  I will point out that because of its proximity to ASU, a lot of hot chicks go here.  I recommend any weeknight around 8 o'clock for the prime hot girl crowd.  Tip:  Apparently the towel service is an additional cost, but many employees will give you one anyway.  Just ask and a lot of times they'll just give you one.

In my opinion, this falls in second place on the list of comparable restaurants that I've been to: Chipotle has always been my #1, then Costa Vida, Qdoba, Cafe Rio.  Costa Vida is no competition when it comes to speed, Chipotle wins that hands down.  I got the chicken burrito with black beans.  It was delicious.  I love mango salsa so I got that.  As far as I know none of the other restaurants that I listed offer that but I could be wrong.

This is similar to Jester's in Scottsdale, but better in my opinion.  Just to give an idea, it's like 'Who's Line is it Anyway?', so every show is completely different.  This is squeaky clean improv humor at its best. These people stand out from other comedy troupes that I've seen.   They have two teams and a referee, and they get points based on audience response.  They have a lot of audience involvement, and they have a wide variety of games.  It was hilarious.  Well worth the $10.00.  They gave us free popcorn, and it was actually 2 for 1 night so it was only $5 each.  I don't know if they do this every Friday or not, it might be a good idea to call and see when they have that deal.  Tip: I think this would be a great place for a date...unless your date doesn't appreciate clean humor, in which case you might check out the Tempe Improv or other venue, but you'll be paying more.

Chipotle is one of my favorite quick serve restaurants, but this is not one of my favorite Chipotles.  Because it is right next to the movie theater, it was convenient to stuff the burrito in my pocket  and eat it while waiting in line at the theater for a screening.  It was fast as usual, but the burrito size was smaller than I'm used to from the one by my work.

I went here to see Dark Knight on the IMAX screen.  Screen size: not impressive, barely noticed it was bigger than your normal movie theater screen.  Sound: Amazing, it was quite stunning.  Seating: not impressive, no leaning chairs, they were just your average movie chairs.  Auditorium temperature: a little warm.  I really wish they would have put Dark Knight on the AZ mills IMAX.  It was not really worth the extra money and drive for me.

For almost every visit prior to this I'd give 5 stars, but I think because of a few new employees, today the experience was different.  First of all, the guy put the wrong kind of beans on my burrito.  Also, the cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt.  I said, 'No', but she still gave it to me.  My burrito was also smaller than usual.  But as always, it was delicious.  And for the setup, they have an extremely efficient way of serving customers.  Tip: Don't be afraid to ask them to put 'a little more rice', or 'a little more beans'.  They will do it and they won't charge extra.
