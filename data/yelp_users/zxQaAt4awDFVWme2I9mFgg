I've been to Uni multiple times for a manicure due to its close proximity to ASU's campus. However, I always leave thinking I would rather have done my nails myself for free. Also, the technicians rush me upon my arrival which gives me anxiety about choosing a color which I feel I should do at my leisure given its a spa-like environment. The worst part of my experience at Uni is that I leave with messy looking nails, an empty wallet (a $20 mani?) and feeling of being unpolished (pun intended).

My friends and I joke that the Pad Thai has crack in it. But that might be the case. I have yet to try a Pad Thai dish that surpasses the one at Thai Basil. I literally eat here once a week (or more) and the portions are large enough to take home to have another meal later. Consistently delicious! Vegan/vegetarian friendly :).

Just thinking about Cornish Pasty makes my mouth water. I highly recommend the Royal with cheese. CP also has a great selection of local drafts. Good service, music and a kick-ass extension of the bar which overlooks the back of the kitchen. And the bread they make (from scratch) is a secret recipe (for good reason) so flaky and delicious!

You won't find aloof baristas or watered down coffee here. This place makes seriously strong beverages. My favorite is the iced Annihilator. You can have almost all of their beverages hot, iced, or blended. Not only is the coffee better than any coffee I've had anywhere but the staff is superior.  The staff is clearly hopped up on what they're brewing but they couldn't be more attentive and sweet as they serve you. I witnessed one girl just arriving to work, saw that there was a line and proceeded to take orders before even clocking in and taking off her purse!   I love to come here when I visit my folks in Arizona. The positivity and bubbly personalities of the baristas are truly touching and can turn any bad day into a lovely experience at the Drive-Thru at Dutch Bros.! Keep it up gang!
