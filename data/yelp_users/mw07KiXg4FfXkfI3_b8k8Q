Kinda bummed we decided to come here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I made a reservation for 730 and we weren't sat until almost 750. Our server was very sweet, but almost non existent. My boyfriend ordered the filet (which is his favorite in all of Arizona) and I ordered the salmon. Although the filet was seasoned so perfectly, the salmon was bland and fishy. A few times throughout our dining experience here, our water was empty. Unpleasant experience when you spend $93 on dinner. I most likely won't be back.

HORRIBLE experience. OVER PRICED- do not waste your money. I had an overlay with polish and they were so bumpy... They looked like a 3 year old polished them. I had to go back three days later to get a nail fixed and they still look BAD! Never again.

I had exceptional service here!! The staff was friendly and fast in my opinion! It was the lunch rush and the manager wanted to give me fresh chicken and asked me if I could wait a few minutes, no big deal!! He gave me a complimentary soda while I waited. NO LONGER than 60 seconds after that, my bowl was made and "complimentary" because I had to wait 3 minutes!! Seriously!?! SO NICE. I was shocked and definitely was not upset at all for waiting for quality. I appreciate that they were concerned with my time and made it feel valued. This is a very busy location during lunch rush and I believe that they staff does try and accommodate every one in a timely manner. Honestly, the "slow service" should be blamed on the SLOW customers... DONT GET IN LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT! Simple as that. My favorite chipotle by far because of the customer service.

service is GREAT at the location ... No complaints at all. Servers are knowledgable about the menu and can answer any questions. I love the beer pretzels on the menu... Literally some of the best I've had around town. Cheap drinks. Best Applebee's in town.

WOW. Where do I start?! AMAZING experience here. It's been so long since I've had a primary care who has been so kind a thorough. The front staff is SO friendly and helpful. I absolutely would recommend anyone here.  I had to change my appointment a few times, but they were so accommodating.

I think most of these reviews are unfair. This Starbucks is EXTREMELY Busy all the time. I live right around the corner from this one so I pop in every now and again. Every one that works here is super friendly and works as fast as possible. I think if anything - they just need to schedule more people on In the mornings to ensure faster service. There's no way to avoid loud noises when there's a line out the door. I give these baristas 5 stars - they definitely do their best. Bottom line, If you're that rushed for your coffee in the morning ... go to a less busy Starbucks.

My boyfriend and I go to this Denny's regularly and all of the staff is nice and friendly. We have had almost every server, but the tall blonde/younger gal is so sweet! I'm surprised she works here to be honest - management should take good care of her, because she could get a job at any restaurant. We will continue to come here- very fast service and our food is always correct and hot! Love this Denny's!

Literally the BEST service here. Like, better than I get at most restaurants. The lady working the drive through is ON IT. She needs a raise.

My boyfriend and I used to live across the street from this place. There's a circle K right by us too, but we would ALWAYS go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers us every time. Super awesome beer selection and a build your own 6-pack for super cheap. Good prices, friendly staff and super convenient!

I'm so impressed. I just had probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Every thing was perfect. Great service.. Whole staff was energetic and friendly, food was amazing, beer was perfectly cold. The male manager absolutely knows what he's doing and deserves a raise. I work a lot and this was the first time I've had a night off... Well spent. I will absolutely come back.

The only problem I've had is that the spray tan machine has been down every now and again, which I get but super annoying still. Friendly staff. Great spray tan (use the barrier cream on your hands and feet). They do charge you for all the little add ons so even if you buy the groupon, you're still spending $18 for a spray but that's still a good deal! I like this place if you're in need of a quick spray tan :)

I love this place... Mainly for the coffee and homemade whipped cream. I've had a cocktail here once and the girl was snobby when I asked for recommendations. I literally feel like there are two friendly people that work here and the rest act like you're a pain in their ass. It sucks because I enjoy coming here, but I find myself going to other coffee shops in this area simply because of the service here. There are two guys on the register that always get tips from me simply because they smile and are friendly while I make my payment. They need to be the ones greeting guests - they would make every one more money.

Okay... EVERY associate in this store is so helpful and more importantly passionate about these products. So helpful and knowledgable. Sounds like they are treated really well as employees and it totally shows. Love this specific store and the products are incredible. Love the face masks!!!

Absolutely thrilled with their customer service. I just got a rescue who seemed to have respiratory issues - he was taken to a local vet who told me it was nothing more than allergies. Later this evening my poor pup had vomited 7 times.. I frantically called a couple 24 hour emergency vet clinics and VCA was so helpful and really put my mind to ease. They recommended that I bring Wylie in, but also allowed me to ask many questions and answered all of them. The gal was so friendly and really seemed to genuinely care about his health. She even offered to follow up with my other vet in the morning. While calling around, I got several quotes and $95 was the average .. I called VCA and theirs was $105... I will definitely spend the extra $10 to go here in the future (even though it's a tad farther) . I wish I knew the gals name I spoke to so I could personally write her a card. REALLY recommend going here if you love your animal as much as I do.

I'm done going to this place. I'm not overly picky, but when I spend $37 I expect much better than this. Don't go here if you're picky because I went back and all they did was laugh in my face and basically ignore the fact that I wasn't happy with the way they looked. She just applied 3 more top coats of gel... Like that's going to help? They look worse. Nails are already lifting and I got them done today. I should have just done them myself.

Okay GREAT coffee and whipped cream is home made. Honestly, I was blown away by the customer service. Both baristas (male and female) were SO NICE and friendly. I feel like it's really rare to have friendly staff at a coffee shop in Phoenix. The place was super clean and both employees were either cleaning or stocking stuff the whole time. I can really appreciate this because customer service is about 75% of my experience. Love this place and the friendly people here. I will definitely be coming here instead of the other popular coffee shops in the area.

Talk to Josh if you need anything! Professional and honest! I can't tell you how many times I've been to the dealership and Firestone nobody seemed to be able to fix my AC problem - got a new compressor at the dealership 4 months ago and started having issues with it blowing cold air. I took advantage of their FREE AC check and they got me in within 5 minutes of my phone call. Meineke has earned my business and I will only go here from now on. My AC IS FIXED. IM SO HAPPY.

By far the best spray tan I have ever gotten. So clean, professional, and the color is AMAZING. NO HINT of orange. It looks so natural. Love this place

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE (minus the girl with really short hair who was the ONLY person to acknowledge me ). I waited for an HOUR for them to pay me for the items they took... Which they were done sorting in 20 minutes. They continued to sort through clothes from customers that came in after me BEFORE checking me out. A girl came in 20 minutes after me and was paid and out before me. I'm extremely frustrated because they had NO system or order in place. A 25 minute trip turned into and hour. Not interested in going here ever again.

First time here. My experience was amazing. I used to be a member at Massage Envy for 3 years and cancelled my membership because it was extremely hard to get in at times that worked to me. I had Eddie and he was GREAT! Probably one of the better massages I've ever had. My massage was therapeutic and relaxing. Their member program is AMAZING. Way better than massage envy and you can share your massages with friends. I HIGHLY recommend going here. I will definitely be returning to Eddie.

EXTREMELY EASY TO BOOK AN APPOINTMENT ONLINE - I'm upset to see any bad reviews about that. I have been going here for almost a year and have NEVER been rescheduled or had issues getting a time that worked for me. I absolutely love this spot. Laura is so sweet and experienced. I love that she can cater to what tone you'd like - unlike a machine that sprays you!! Throughly love my spray tan every. Single. Time AND the pricing is great if you pay cash!!! Make sure you tip- it's common courtesy.

BEST NAIL SALON IVE BEEN TO. I live in Old Town Scottsdale and I drive all the way over here because I KNOW I'm going to love my nails. Super friendly staff , great prices, super clean. They are updated on trends and have tons and tons of designs and colors to choose from. I'm super skeptical about nail salons, but I totally trust this one. I highly recommend going here. It's less busy during the week.

Where do I start... VERY unpleasant visit and experience at this specific location. Waited an extra 25 minutes before I was seen - now, I understand that this happens and appointments fall behind but it's irritating that no one follows up with you to tell you your appointment is going to run late. After waiting the additional 25 minutes, the doctors assistant came in and asked me basic questions and said the doctor would be in shortly. I had a list of questions to ask since I hadn't been checked by a dermatologist in a while. She rushed with me and stayed in the room MAYBE 8 minutes. She recommended that I use a certain kind of face wash and when I asked the assistant what it was called, she said something along the lines of "idk, you can find it at CVS". I didn't get to ask all my questions before she rushed out of the room AND to top it off, getting the prescriptions was a nightmare. They didn't send all of the prescriptions to the Walgreens and when I called and left a message for the "on call" person, no one ever called me back. I waited an additional 3 days for the CORRECT prescriptions to be sent and that was after I called the office 3 times. I ended up describing my visit to another doctor there who kindly prescribed what I needed. I was told to call back if I needed another round and when I placed a refill order, it was denied. Very disappointed with the lack of customer service here. Was thinking about getting facials and additional treatments originally, But I will be taking my business elsewhere and I suggest you do too.

I texted several mobile iPhone screen repair companies and apple Idoc was the ONLY one to respond in a timely manner and bent over backwards to fix my screen. Super professional, great prices, SO FAST. They took card which was awesome AND it comes with a 90 day warranty. I definitely recommend using them over other local companies.

Sad to see that Scott has a bad review on here! I had a wonderful experience with him. To be fair, the photo that has the bad review looks like bad aftercare more than anything. This was my first time at this shop and Scott was very professional and friendly. I am very happy with the outcome of my tattoo and would recommend friends to him. His lines are very clean!! By far one of the cleanest, friendliest shops I've been to. Very happy.

Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience here... I took my Mother to lunch for the first time and we both ordered salads. The cashier asked us if we wanted to add chicken - we both replied "yes" and she said "cold or grilled" - we both said grilled. Our total bill was a little higher than expected so my mom nicely asked why. The girl was extremely rude and said, "grilled chicken is more."  and basically laughed at my mom for even asking the question... We were not rude, we did not ask for it to be taken off the bill - just a simple question. I've worked in the service industry for years and it rubs me the wrong way, because she was completely polite while asking a valid question. I have had lunch in the actual dining room and I had a wonderful experience with a MUCH more friendly staff, so I will just stick to that instead.

Love this place. Dog friendly ... Rotating beers on draft. The staff is super knowledgable about the menu. Menu is a little weird but every thing I've had so far was good. I recommend this place! Chill environment - definitely would visit again.

Super happy with my experience with Alisha! She's so friendly, happy and professional!! She walked me through how to take care of my hair at home and I didn't feel rushed at all. Definitely best customer service I've had in a while. VERY VERY happy with the final result of my hair. I recommend trying to get an early appointment here and make sure you don't have to work that day - they do take their time on your hair ... so it could take longer than expected, BUT that means they care. I would definitely recommend my friends to Alisha.

Seriously GREAT SERVICE. I'm amazed! Such a friendly staff. I ordered food to go and they had it ready for me at the bar when I got there. The bartender was busy, but took a minute to talk to me and get me settled up. Both managers approached me and asked if there was anything else they could get me before I left. Really clean environment, friendly staff, great food - what else could you ask for?! I have worked in the restaurant industry for a long time, so I tend to be really picky anywhere I go. I actually thought I had misplaced my credit card so when I went back in... Both managers were helping me look for it (turned out it's in my other pocket and I'm an airhead). Anyways,  the hostess was smiley, attentive and opened the door for me when I was leaving. I definitely recommend getting friends together and eating here.

Cleanest, most organized Goodwill I've ever been to. The staff is very helpful and friendly and the manager is ALWAYS doing something. Every time I've been in here, he's in a good mood and so friendly. I find myself going to this goodwill more than any others just for the simple fact of the organization and service. Love this place!!! Always find great deals!!

Horrible experience here. I called several times leading up to out get together and I was told there was no way to make a reservation - I had 14 people in my party. This was suppose to be a SURPRISE get together for my boyfriends 35th birthday. He LOVES topgolf- one of the friends in the party agreed to get there at 345 to put our name in. She had never been to topgolf before and no one explained to her the process. She put our name down and requested two bays around 345 and she was quoted 30 minutes. This was perfect because every one was arriving around 4. We waited until 455 to be sat. UNREAL. We went up to the counter several times to check on the status of our group and the girl kept telling us ten more minutes. Absolutely unacceptable - just be honest and quote and hour and 15. We had dinner reservations at 730 25 minutes away and didn't start golfing until 500. When we were sat, we were told to quickly start so that we could receive the $35 an hour rate instead of the $45. Super unpleasant experience. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP. It was a nightmare.

Loved this little place! Simple/clean ambiance with a true Arizona feel. We had the prickly pear and maple bacon. SO DELICIOUS. I thoroughly enjoyed both, but you have to try the maple bacon!

LOVE THIS SPOT. Gorgeous facility - dog friendly on the patio!! I have been here several times and have always received great service - actually, better service than some high end spots in scottsdale. I absolutely love their pizzas and wraps. This is NOT like any other brewery in Scottsdale - All of the management is professional, friendly and humbled. I love the "come as you are" vibe here. Arizona needs MORE Fate Breweries. Definitely one of my favorite places to go with friends.
