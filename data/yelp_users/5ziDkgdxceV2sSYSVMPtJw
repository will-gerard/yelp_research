Food was average. If you are looking for a great steakhouse, look elsewhere. This is a 2 star hotel meal. Ordered a $40 steak (sides separate). Tastes more like Sizzler than a high end steak house.

Awesome!!! The margarita's will kick your a** and the food is soooooo good. Not authentic Mex but the best American Mexican (even better if you ask me)  you will find in Phoenix!!!!  Huge portions and value priced.

SERIOUSLY!! 8 wings for $11. Are you kidding me!!?  What a rip off. Go to ZIPPS near Kierland bigger portions and better service. Thanks no thanks. :-/

Food was cold and over cooked. Biscuits taste like Bisquick and gravy was blah. The one good thing it had going for it was the good service and friendly staff.
