I've been here a few times now, probably 6-7 in the past year. I've enjoyed every encounter, both dining in and take out.  No its not modern. It doesn't have a unique take on the Mexican food. It won't win any awards.  But it's as close to Mexican comfort food as it gets, and I love it. IT reminds me of growing up in Phoenix, and all of the family started Mexican restaurants all over the valley. Simple and filling.   The service has always been great, everyone  who works there seems genuinely glad you came.  I'm a simple man. That's good enough for me.

0/5  Employee acted as if I was hassling her, as I obviously was holding her up from the call she was on with her cell phone. As I left, she apologized to the person on the phone for, what I can only assume was being held up bye, a customer.   There was no line to wait in and receive such stellar treatment.

Ah-So is a great addition to the Goodyear area.   I walked into an enjoyable environment, with helpful service and great food. My friends have enjoyed the happy hour specials, and their great sushi offerings almost every week for a month now. I have not tried much of the teppanyaki table offerings, but from the sushi menu,  I can say that I have fully enjoyed the experience. We will return regularly for good food and good times.

Come here, drink good beer and wine. meet the locals. This is a bar for a city that's finally getting a personality.

Got in fast. Doctor saw me on time. Took the time to listen and relate. Was clear, and communicated his diagnosis and plan well. Very impressed overall. Now, if only the spasms in my neck would go away quickly...

Good food. A little pricey for what you get, but definitely better than taco bell.
