Okay, so part of the one star rating is my own fault.  It was the first morning on my first trip to Vegas.  We were staying at NY NY and got off the elevators at 930am after a long night and saw "Chinese Buffet Brunch!"  Now, why on earth did I think Chinese buffet - for breakfast - would be a good idea?  I'll never know.  The place was packed though, so I followed the leader.  5 minutes after eating, I had to run back up to my hotel room and then  spend the next hour on the bed clutching my stomach.  Yeah.  And don't blame it on the booze the night before... I wasn't even hungover when I woke up.  Lesson learned.

Short and sweet:  Just don't.    I don't care how cheap The Luxor is and the fact that the only reason you need a room in Vegas is so you'll have somewhere to pass out in... just don't.  I've learned my lesson and will pony up the extra cash to stay somewhere that doesn't suck.

This review is for lunch in the Downstairs part of the restaurant.  We're huge Top Chef fans and when we saw Rick kill it on Bravo we knew our trip to Vegas had to include RM Seafood.  We made reservations for lunch on Thursday and in we walked.  The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous.  Water flows about the ceiling  and the open kitchen makes you feel like a part of the action.  The modernness of it all is just perfect from what I wanted to experience from RM.    We ordered the $24 Surf and Turf Roll (tempura prime beef, cherry peppers, crispy shallots, seared albacore ponzu, lavender honey) and it was hands down the best roll we've ever, and I mean EVER eaten.  I then ordered the Adam's Fish Sandwich (Beer Batter, Tartar Sauce, Aged Cheddar) which was yep, the best fish sandwich I've ever tasted...  though I will admit I've probably only had 3 fish sandwiches in my life.  But still - if I knew every fish sandwich would taste that good, that would be my go-to sandwich.  The fries that came with it were amazingly addictive.  Ohh and the homemade tartar sauce... I practically drank the rest of it in the cup.  He ordered the Fish Tacos Pico de Gallo (Shredded Cabbage, chipotle Cream) and he said they were in the top 3 fish tacos ever.  Super fresh and the flavors were so well balanced.    Okay, so lots of praise.  Lots of "BEST EVER!!!!"  But, RM Seafood deserves every word of praise.  Why 4 stars?  The service was TERRIBLE.  We were 2 of 8 people in the restaurant and the food took well over a half hour to come out.  The waiter spent too much time trying too hard to get to know us and then disappeared for a long time after we asked him to check on the food.  They didn't take our used plates away after the sushi roll and left us with a cluttered table as we waited for so long for our lunch.  Also?  By the time the food actually showed up, I was too hungry and literally forgot to take a picture of my sandwich.  Which never happens.  I'd actually give service here a 1 star.  All in all though, RM Seafood is everything its lived up to be.  Well done.

We stayed at The Luxor (mistake #1) and found this place to be the only restaurant in the hotel to get some eggs and bacon (to order) to clear up the hangover.  We went twice while we were in Vegas.  Here's why it sucked:  1)  The line is so so long even though more than half the tables were completely open.  They just refused to sit us. 2)  The service is TERRIBLE.  When I asked for waters the waitress rolled her eyes at me and disappeared for ten minutes. 3)  Poached eggs came in a small dish on the side, swimming in water.  While blotting the eggs on a napkin, my yolk broke.  That just sucks. 4)  We ordered turkey sausage and they brought greasy pork sausage.  When I pointed that out, the waitress told me we were wrong and that it was obviously turkey.  No. Pork. 5)  Underseasoned and bland hash browns.    What's good:  1)  Uhm... bacon.  Bacon is always good.  For what this place charges and for it being the only real breakfast spot in the hotel, I wished for a lot more.  Thankfully, I'll never step foot into the Luxor again after our experience which means I'll never have to eat at the Pyramid Cafe again.

I actually really liked this place!  We had a teeny wait on a Saturday at 11:30am but we got a great table and a really nice waitress.  I was craving some Benedict (when am I not?) so I got that and the boy ordered some omelette that was full of ridiculousness.  Awesome Eggs Benedict.  Take a look at my picture of the three eggs they served!  Super yum. I'll definitely go back there next time I'm in Vegas.

We found ourselves still awake, a little drunk, and starving at 4am on a Thursday morning while staying at MGM and realized there were only two options for food.  McDonalds (ugh) or Wolfgang Pucks.  Wolfgang Pucks totally overexposed itself.  I think of WP and think of airport food or frozen pizza.  Or well.. just commercialized bullsh*t.    But, there was no way we were going to McDonalds.  We found our seats at the bar, told the bartender we had a Prima card and he immediately put in a free order of Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese and Chives.  Looking through the menu we stopped on the "Croque Madame" - Grilled Ham and Gruyere with Fried Egg and Mixed Green Salad and both decided that we should each get one.  I mean, come on, who can split a croque madame.  Now here was go.  The potato chips?  Stupid good.  Truffle sauce lined the bottom of the plate.  The blue cheese was soft and scoopable and we finished every last morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  But the croque madame was the winner.  Actually it was the food winner of the entire vacation.  Never in my life have I tasted something so sinfully delicious.. ham, gruyere, bechamel, the perfect fried egg... holy heaven.  The thing was bigger than my head.  The side salad was tossed with a dressing that actually tasted like a breakfast salad.   I finished the entire thing and still wanted more.  My opinion of Wolfgang has been forever changed back to the great chef, leader and brand we knew him to be.  If you're in Vegas, I swear to god you need to stay up late - go to Wolfgang Puck - order the croque madame and potato chips... and your trip to Vegas will be worth every dime that you lost in Vegas.

It's really too bad this place will be closing soon.  The space was really upscale, but comfortable, and the Bunnies were super sweet.  We only stayed for about an hour drinking martini's at the blackjack table before heading up to Moon - but we should've stayed longer.  I'm so glad I got to experience this place before they move on from the Palms.

I can't believe this place is getting such a low rating, I'm so glad this is one of the first times I didn't look to Yelp for reviews before we went.  We flew into Vegas from Boston with a rental car already in place to make the 3 hour trip to the Skywalk midway through our vacation.  Here's how my experience went down:  Wake up around 8:00am, grab a coffee, spend $15 on a cab to get to the Hertz at the airport to pick up a 2012 Mustang Convertible ($112 including all taxes and fees).  Drive through some amazing scenery, stop for some sunblock, end up in the middle of nowhere - but still going the right way.  Take like 3 turns and end up at the entrance of the skywalk.  Drive 45 minutes up their driveway (13 miles are unpaved and definitely a little scary) and drive towards the magnificent Grand Canyon.   Park where they tell you, go buy your tickets (if you're military or a vet be sure to show them ID for $25 off your admission) and grab a quick lunch before boarding a bus.    First stop:  Skywalk.  The first time you see the depth of the Canyon, it takes your breath away.  Take a bunch of pictures before storing all your stuff in a free locker.  Side note:  I'd rather not accidentally drop my camera 4,000 feet into the Canyon - I was fine storing it.  Get in a small line and put on some booties to walk onto the glass.  Walk onto the glass and SH*T YOUR PANTS.  Sorry, but yes, that b*tch is SCARY!  While you'll need a shot to get over that experience, unfortunately the reservation is dry.  Bum a cigarette instead.  Next stop:  A peak.  An amazing peak.  A view to remember.  Take tons of pictures, photoshop the crowd out, and it's just you and nature.  Next stop:  Your car.  That's it.  And yes, it was worth the $200 entrance fee.  Drive back to Vegas with the top down stopping at the Hoover Dam for good measure, sit in some traffic, get the car washed ($6 at a nearby car wash), return the car, $15 back to the Strip, and a full amazing day ends with martini's, sushi, and incredible pictures.    Should we have driven to the South Rim?  Some day.  But the 10 round trip time was a little too much to handle.  How much did it cost?  $350 all in.  Would I recommend it?  Absof*ckinglutely.
