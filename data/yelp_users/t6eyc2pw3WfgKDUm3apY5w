Danny's has been sold to Jackson's and the days of a quality car wash at a reasonable price have departed... :-(  The area is ripe for a new full service supplier or even one of those $3 deals to come in and steal the show!  Today I went over and the mid-grade wash is now $16, they still try to upsell you, of course!  They don't have enough personnel to manage the amount of vehicles and the finished product is pretty sad... lots of spots on the windows, tire treatment pretty cheesy, left the writing on the window, etc.

Chinese food is definitely individual specific.  While I loved the people and the place... had a glass of wine while awaiting my order, I was not really impressed with the food.  The General Tso Chicken was not very crispy or have much spice.  The Sweet & Sour Chicken was over-cooked and tough.  The Lo Mein noodles were thick and too soft.  The crab puffs were pretty greasy and the pastry was a bit tough.  The Egg Drop soup was pretty runny also.  I felt it was very expensive and in need of a better chef.  The people at the front made it a very pleasant experience.

Hilda, Susan, Mary and Carrie make a wonderful team.  Walk into Pluma and let the world go away while you enjoy a wonderful hair experience.  Have a few roasted nuts with some hot tea and enjoy the topic of the moment.  Everyone is welcomed and introduced and the warmth and joy is effervescent.  You will walk away with the perfect cut, color and style of your life!

I made my first trip to Desert Donuts today and oh boy!  I went thinking I would get a crueller or bear claw and found something far superior... donuts made on the spot, piping hot with my personal choice of toppings!!!  I purchased 4 to go... awesome!  Couple things... go online, choose your toppings in advance and better yet, call in your order as the line can be rather long.  They offer fresh roasted coffee from Passport Coffee, a local roaster in Scottsdale so the java is just as great as the donuts!  One thing... check your order, sometimes they miss a topping.
