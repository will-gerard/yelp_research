Reminds me of the markets in the Los Angeles area. I love coming here to buy individual bottles of different beers from around the world. It makes me miss home in Pasadena. I can't wait to get back. I recommend this store to anyone who wants to be different.

I usually buy coffee, not lattes or any other flavored drinks. I'm not a fan of coffeehouses that brew individual cups of regular coffee because it takes too long I experienced the same thing at Intelligentsia in Old Town Pasadena when I lived there. Just brew an urn or two and be done with it. It would save you time to make the specialty drinks.  Another thing that I find cheesy is that they use powdered creamer talk about poison use real milk products not coffee mate creamers. Nice homey atmosphere but too small. I probably won't be back.

I'm only a member here because 24 Hour Fitness pulled out of Arizona. As soon as I find viable employment in Southern California I'm out of this dreary state. I like the massage chairs but you can only use them for only 5 minutes at a time. The decor is dark and dreary. It serves it's purpose for now. California here I come!
