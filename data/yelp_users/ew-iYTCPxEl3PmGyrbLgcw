Wow, I had a half an egg salad sandwich and a bowl of the creamy chicken with rice soup. Their egg salad didn't have celery, so they diced some up and added it to my sandwich for me, how great!  Both the soup and sandwich were absolutely fantastic, I WILL be back!

My mom ordered the lemon veal, and it was nasty, voted so by her friend that tasted it as well!!  The server would have nothing to do with replacing the meal, or compensating in any way whatsoever, the manager had the same attitude. Ultimately my mom left, on her birthday, hungry!    They claimed if they replaced food for everyone, they wouldn't have a business. Well, they won't have our business moving forward!

This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back.

I just ate here today for lunch. I had the green curry with veggies and tofu lunch special. It was $8 and came with either soup or salad. I choose salad, the peanut dressing was yummy!   My curry was ah-mazing!  It had sliced and cooked jalapenos, eggplant, snap peas, green beans, zucchini, broccoli, and yummy fried tofu. The curry itself was very rich, and the perfect (for me) spice, I ordered it hot, not Thai hot. I have at least one more meal here as leftovers...great find, I'll be back!!

I like this location a lot. I went to one in Tempe and they sent me back while the doctor was working with someone else. I felt very strange watching another person get adjusted. This location you are welcome to stay in the waiting room until it is your turn to go back.  Dr Stuart is really a great doctor. Normally I am uncomfortable having manual adjustments and prefer getting adjusted with the activator. When I met dr. Stuart however, I felt comfortable and allowed him to do manual adjustment. I am very happy I did in fact I no longer have to drive up to highway 101 and 59th Ave to get adjusted. I have also been having issues with TMJ. Dr. Stuart has been working with it and it's feeling much better.

I love Dr Brian!  He uses the activator and the technique that goes with it. It's a bit different, it's gentle and doesn't cause sweats or dizziness like most manual adjustments have for me.  It specifically adjusts what needs to be adjusted, not everything!  He also spends a lot of time if you need it, he's a really great guy!  I've been driving half an hour to get here because of Dr Brian.

The guys in the service department are really great!!  I read the negative reviews, and was expecting bad service, this has been great!  I look forward to coming back for my next experience!
