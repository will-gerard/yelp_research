After the amazing dinner experience I had here, I truly can not believe that Hillstone doesn't have a 5 star rating! I loved everything about it. The food. The atmosphere. The service. All top notch!   Since Tuesday nights are horrible for celebrating birthdays, my boyfriend treated me to dinner at Hillstone the following Saturday. We came around 7:00pm and were told there was an hour wait. (FYI, they don't take reservations). Luckily for us, there was one table open outside that we were able to relax at in the meantime. Never had I ever sat on a patio with air conditioning vents under the table, cooling your legs. Impressed from the start! A really nice, funny server took care of us as we had wine and french fries. At exactly the one hour mark, an inside booth was ready for us!  My bf had the Hillstone Burger with coleslaw. It was definitely worthy of being his only cheat meal of the week. There were multiple items on the menu that sounded great, but I ultimately ordered the Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Excellent choice, self! It was delicious. Another unique detail that I'd never seen before: Lemons were served in a cloth-like mesh bag to keep seeds from getting squeezed into your iced tea or food.   Then...surprise! Our server brought out a hot fudge sundae (with a candle on top) and a Nordstrom box. As it turns out, my bf had sneakily ordered dessert and given her my birthday gift while I was in the restroom. I did not see that coming! Haha. It was such a big bowl of ice cream that we couldn't finish it, but I will say that getting to pour the chocolate sauce on yourself was pretty fun.   All in all, it was a fabulous night and I'm so glad that a friend recommended Hillstone to us. I would definitely come back and suggest it to others for a special night out.

Eh. This location is often crowded and overwhelming (long lines, feeling rushed). I definitely prefer the other Chipotle located on Scottsdale Road, but since I needed something to eat and was already in this shopping center, I stopped in for a chicken bowl. Like many Yelpers have said, the portions here are pretty skimpy. They seemed to put plenty of sour cream on my food, yet very limited chicken and lettuce. I never want to ask for more, as you'd likely get charged for "double meat". Yeah, no. There wasn't enough in the first place. Think I'll go elsewhere next time. Chipotle just isn't worth it any more.

I've flown in or out of this airport at least 5 times with no trouble. The construction and drop off area can be confusing and inconvenient when picking someone up, but I like this airport as a flyer! I set a personal best record of getting through security to my gate for a red-eye flight on Thanksgiving morning. It was empty! I was actually kind of annoyed at myself for getting there so early, but I was expecting worse for such a big, popular airport. Safe travels!

Perhaps my love of OTB comes from having worked at one for 3.5 years, making it feel a bit like a second home. The location didn't last in my town so I was excited to get my OTB fix (after 4 long years) while visiting my sister in Arizona.  The hostess was really nice and greeted us right away. Though quickly seated at a booth, it took quite a few minutes before a server came to ask if anyone had helped us yet. Seeing as no one had, he got our drink order (frozen house strawberry margarita! yesss!) and brought chips and salsa.  They straight up haven't changed the menu  in a long time, as everything was exactly how I remember. We had the Vegetable Fajita, Big Bordurrito, and Ranchiladas...all of which were awesome. Other good choices if you're in need of help: Grilled Avocado Enchilada, Southwest Chicken Tacos, Border Sampler, and Ultimate Fajita.  My sister and her bf have pretty much been disappointed by all the Mexican restaurants they've tried around Tempe since moving here 6 months ago, and while not authentic, she already wants to go back to OTB so she can get some Empanadas. This place rules!  One odd thing I can add is that when we asked about the free queso for joining the email club thing, the server said he didn't think they were honoring that and there had been a meeting recently in which a manager said they weren't giving away free quesos anymore...but there is a chalkboard advertising it in the front entrance of the restaurant. Sooo, they should come to a decision. Do know it'll take a few hours to receive your coupon by email - we had been asking for future reference since she lives close by.

My love for On the Border is no more. The last time my sister and I ate dinner here together, we both ended up really sick the next day. It took a few months for me to brave going back, but one day, I had a craving for Southwest Chicken Tacos. I ordered them to-go after work and while they tasted fine (post grease drainage), I can't say that the meal made me want to go back anytime soon. Sigh.

My sister, who teases me about taking food pics and Yelping businesses, loves Doc & Eddy's so much that she insisted I let her dictate a review for them. Lol.   Here it is:  "This is my absolute favorite dive bar, but I don't understand why it's so crowded all the time. They have the best fucking crispy hot delicious dusted butter ranch wings I've ever had in my entire life! Their french fries are also so hot and crispy. Mmmmmm, soooo good. This bar feels like my cousin's basement and boy do I love it. Again, not sure why it's so crowded all the time."  Well, there you have it.  Personally, I really like their chicken caesar wrap and that they have Papago Orange Blossom on draft. It's a chill place to play pool with friends.

My advice: count the # of Out of Order games before you buy a credit card! What arcade has 3 non functioning air hockey tables?! Everywhere we turned things were out of order so we spent our $10 on Dance Dance Revolution and basketball. The music on some DDR consoles was SO loud we couldn't hear our own song when someone was playing beside us and the number of tickets received from games seemed to be totally random (as there were 3 of us playing and the winner always got less than the others - huh?) Also not a fan of the $2.50 card activation fee...whiiich we had to buy at the service desk because surprise surprise the automated machine was broken. I've never been charged tax to add money to an arcade card before either. Have fun, mall shoppers. I have no desire to visit this place again.

I've always had good experiences at this Victoria's Secret store, but today was above and beyond. Intrigued by the Semi-Annual Sale, I stopped by on a Tuesday morning (the 1st day of deals) and was greatly impressed by how welcoming, friendly, and helpful all of the employees were. Seriously, when the cashier asked who had assisted me today I exclaimed, "Everyone!" (Though I wish I had known 3 of the ladies by name.) Not only was customer service top notch; there were a TON of bras and panties on sale!   Honestly, I'd never taken advantage of a VS Semi-Annual sale before because bra shopping is the hardest thing in the world and how is anyone ever supposed to know their correct size?! Grrrr. BUT! That all changed a few months ago (at thiiis store), when a sales associate enlightened me to the amazingness that is Body by Victoria and actually identified the size (through a little trial and error) that works perfectly for me. They are the softest, most comfortable bras (yet cute with push-up) I've owned in all my life and I now refuse to wear anything else. Haha. Flash forward back to the present, and I was able to enter VS confident in what I was looking for.   The bins and drawers of lingerie were very well organized and conveniently placed throughout the store, making it a breeze to maneuver around searching for matching sets. I ended up making 2 trips to the dressing room with less than a minute of wait time. That's amazing! By the end I had found 4 bras (only $20 each), 6 panties and 2 garters ($5 a piece) that I LOVED. Checkout was quick and easy and I left feeling super satisfied with my purchases and overall experience.   I actually stopped by the VS at Tempe Marketplace later the same evening and it was the exact opposite (pitiful inventory, poorly organized, employees talking more amongst themselves than to customers, etc), making me appreciate this Scottsdale store even more. I see no reason to go anywhere else! 5 stars!

The pizza at Grimaldi's is 5 star worthy, but I have to knock them down one star for their prices. I knew what to expect because I've eaten at a Grimaldi's in Dallas and Charleston before, but still, it's expensive pizza considering they charge $3-5 per topping. What brought me in to this location is that I received a coupon for a Free Large Pizza with 1 Topping for my birthday, thanks to signing up for their email club (Thank you, Grimaldi's)!   Their shaded patio with misters and string lights was a nice spot to dine on a warm weekday afternoon. I was seated and greeted promptly, and checked on appropriately throughout the meal. For food, I had a small Caesar salad which could've been split with someone. Was it good? Yes, it tasted like every other Caesar salad I've ever had. Worth $8? Probably not. I'd prefer a smaller serving size for a smaller price, as $8 felt like a bit much for what it was really worth. The pizza however, was delicious! I love the thin, crispy crust and red sauce. I only had room for 2 slices at lunch, but am eager to have the rest as leftovers! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for an upscale pizza night.

I think the key to eating here is to go during HAPPY HOUR!! Otherwise, yeah, I'd agree with other Yelpers that paying $14 for a 5 piece speciality sushi roll is ridiculous. However, I had no problem eating the same roll for $7.75! ;)  When we first got here the hostess was seating a party of 2 in front of us, which was a very slow process. Then she came back and blankly said, "How can I help you?" Umm, how do you think you can help us? What kind of greeting is that? lol. Obviously we want help getting a table for 3. And thanks for being so friendly! Once sat, our server was nice and took good care of us.  Happy hour drink specials are about $2 cheaper than usual so it's not that great of a deal, but again, we saved almost 50% on the food...and it was delicious!  Between the 3 of us, we had edamame (nice and salty), crispy spicy tuna rice balls (4 of them - would be a rip-off normally), pork potstickers, spicy salmon roll, spicy calamari roll (very good), and 2 Viva Las Vegas rolls (fancy looking and mmmmm)!  They brought out the food as it was ready - meaning everything came out at different times (this would be really annoying to most people, but it worked out well for us since we were trying so many things and had a chance to enjoy them one at a time).   I liked the black and red interior too. Bottom line, this place is not as bad as other reviews make it sound. I liked it and would totally come back - but only between 4:00-7:00p.m. If you pay full price, you're doing it wrong.

I can't believe my sister almost forgot to take me here while I'm in town visiting! This place is AWESOME. I guess it's not a regular spot for her because its always so crowded and parking is limited, but on a Sunday night during winter break...no worries. I mean, there were still a lot of people here...we were just lucky enough to snag a spot out front.  We were seated at a tall table on the patio, somewhat near a heater and ohmygosh, it was perfect outside. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly, and I'm in love with their peach beer! Just like other Yelpers mentioned, the FRIES. They're really good, as was the Garden Burger which had melted pepperjack cheese, roasted red peppers, spinach, lettuce, and tomato. The sweet jalapeño sauce was too spicy for me on its own but tasted awesome on the burger. I like that you have to option to substitute the veggie burger patty in place of one of the other burger versions but lets be real - the Garden Burger has the best topping choices already.  Apparently their chicken tenders are amazing! The chicken egg rolls (umm, not sure what their official title is) weren't exactly what my sister was expecting and she'd probably order something different next time (this brings me back to the chicken tenders), but she still thought they were good and liked the jalapeño sauce and chipotle ranch to dip them in.  Atmosphere, service, food, local beer...this place is the total package! Definitely put it on your "must see" list of places to eat in Tempe!

My sister and I came here on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet (which ends at 2:30, just FYI). Although the food options were pretty limited, everything that I tried was very tasty! I liked that chai tea was included. We had no trouble with service, as everyone was pleasant, our water and naan were refilled throughout the meal, and tables were bussed promptly. I'd come back, but for $10-11 each, not very often. I'd rather try out some other Indian buffets that offer more.

Having never tried Vietnamese food before, I really had no idea what to except when my sister brought me here for lunch one day. She pointed out what she usually orders and I stuck close to it. I believe mine was #40 - the rice vermicelli noodles with BBQ beef and Eggrolls. It was delish and tasted considerably light for a noodle dish! My sister had the same thing, but with pork (I want to say #34 maybe). I would highly recommended both of them. And oh my gosh, the Thai tea with tapioca was the best I've tried anywhere. I would definitely come back for the same meal!

This is currently my favorite place for wings in the valley! Specifically, the teriyaki wings. Not only are they big and delicious, but a dozen is only $6 during Happy Hour ($8 regularly). That alone makes me go out of the way to visit Casey Moore's when I'm having a craving, but I also love their cute patio and draft beers. Definitely check it out!

Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, "Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.  While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!  The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was "effing delicious" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy.   Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the "Pilgrim" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.  Definitely put this on your "must see" list of places to eat (for lunch)!

I will never for the life of me understand why snack prices in movie theaters are so expensive, but aside from that, I've had plenty of great experiences here. The best of all was last night when I got to see The Conjuring 2 in their Cine Capri theater! Whaaaat? I didn't even know this thing existed, but it was awesome! A manager actually made an opening statement with a microphone before the film started to announce all of the theater's special  features and introduce a customer service representative that would be present the whole time. Well, that was unique! The huge screen and incredible sound made the movie that much more intense. I highly recommend watching a movie in here, although now I never want to sit in a normal theater again. Haha.  Having moved to AZ from Charleston, SC (where we mainly only have Regal Cinemas), I also just learned that Harkins sells cups and t-shirts that you can bring/wear to get $1.50 drink refills and free medium popcorns for the whole year. That is so worth it!

Having grown up in the Southeast where In N Out does not exist, I never understood why this place has a cult-like following. I'd see such excited social media posts with lots of pictures any time someone ate at one of these restaurants, which seemed no different than any other fast food burger joint. That's why I hadn't bothered to try In N Out, despite living in Arizona for the past 7-8 months. I must say, after visiting this location on a late Sunday afternoon, I have a better appreciation for this place. Not even taking the food into consideration, I was very impressed by how many staff members were working at the time - legitimately working. Everyone was seriously busy the entire time and providing excellent customer service. The restaurant looked very clean and I liked the transparency of being able to see right into the kitchen. Nothing was "hidden". Where else do you get to watch potatoes getting cut into fresh fries? Also, they seemed to really care about the presentation of their food. Which by the way, my cheeseburger was very good and I liked that I could get the onions sauteed. As a first-timer, I found the menu a little confusing (despite how completely basic it appears) because my friend was explaining all the crazy ways you can order. It's like a secret language I don't know - but want to learn. I kept it very simple this time, but would definitely come back here before ever going to Burger King or any other similar place ever again.

I would definitely like to come back here again! Last week, I tried Genghis Grill for the first time, not knowing what to expect. The whole "build your own bowl" concept was actually really cool!   Luckily, my bf and I went for a late lunch so the place was relatively empty (as an indecisive person, I'd probably feel overwhelmed with the amount of options to choose from if there had been a line of people behind me). Lots of meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces offered! They even had 5 or 6 bases to choose from (brown rice, egg noodles, etc).   Despite not knowing what I was doing...I mean, there was no plan or coordination as to what would go well with anything. I was just throwing everything that looked good into the bowl. (Kind of like how I make my FroYo)...mine came out soo well! I think it was about $25 for our 2 medium bowls, which were both very filling and delicious.   An interesting place for lunch, despite its Tempe Marketplace food court-esque location.

After a fun day in the sun, my friends wanted to grab something to eat and chose Thai House because it was close by. They think it's less American-ized than others and has authentic spices / flavors, making it their favorite Thai restaurant around. While I wasn't able to notice a huge difference between the Pad Se Eu at Thai House and my favorite spot at home in Charleston, the food was very good with nice portions. I tried a few bites of my friend's Panang Chicken as well and oh my gosh, it was delicious! I would come back again just to order that for myself.

I didn't have a baaad shopping experience here per se (other than long wait times for the dressing room, which is to be expected during the Semi Annual Sale), but I can't rate this store well compared to other Victoria's Secrets in the area. For example, I visited the Scottsdale Fashion Mall location on the same day that I came here and the Tempe Marketplace had a PITIFUL amount of stock, in comparison. It was also much less organized. I would go to the Scottsdale store in a heartbeat after the fantastic customer service and amazing goods I scored this morning but would not return to Tempe Marketplace for lingerie.

Oohhh, I usually order a Greek Night Club pita with chicken, but upon feeling indecisive and learning that Mika's has online ordering...one of the meat choices listed was 1/2 chicken 1/2 gyro. Um, yes please! They had all sorts of options that you can customize with a simple click of a button (white or wheat pita? no onions? extra sauce? cut in half? etc. Boom! Done.) It even gave me a pick-up time and I received text notifications when my order was in-process and ready for pick-up. Having already paid online, I just walked in, was handed my bag, and went on my way. The whole process was very simple, convenient, and fast! Plus, I didn't have to mispronounce gyro over the phone. Hahaha. Score!   My pita was excellent ~ stuffed full of gyro, chicken, lettuce, tomato, onions, kalamata olives, tzatziki, and feta! Mmm! It was a little on the salty side, which I actually like, but just something to consider if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. The side greek salad was also very good. One of these days I'll get around to trying the lentil soup...  All in all, you can get a great, fast, filling meal here for less than $10, that you feel about eating. WIN.

Y'all, THE VEGGIE BURGER. I actually prefer Carolina Ale House's use of a Morningstar Farms patty topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, onion rings, and barbecue sauce over the homemade versions most places disappoint with. Also, lets talk about the fries, which were salty perfection. $2 beer pints (err, they ran out of Magic Hat #9) and this place was a great stop before and after the Pearl Jam concert!

Phoenix Ale Brewery had me at "Watermelon Wheat". However, after sipping the White Chocolate Ale and enjoying the service and atmosphere (really cool artwork and friendly people at the bar) so much yesterday, I have plenty more reasons to come back now! Great experience. Look forward to bringing my friends here, so they can love it too.

I've always loved bagel sandwiches for breakfast and am so glad I found this place on Yelp! I've been to The Bagel Man twice now for a bacon, egg, and cheese on everything and both times it was excellent! I just moved to Tempe a month ago, but don't think I'll even bother trying other bagel shops. This one already has my heart with its bagel perfection and timely / friendly service.

I love this place so much! The teryaki chicken bowl with sweet potato hash and a power green juice (add spinach) is my usual order and while sometimes I wish I'd try other item menus...I can't stray. It's too good to miss out on! Service has always been friendly and fast enough (but do be patient with the fresh juices). Outside seating is a plus. The only thing that would make me like Chop Shop more is lower prices, but I always leave feeling good about what I ate so it's worth it. Definitely stop by if you're in Old Town (although they have plenty of other locations, too)!

Gahhh, if I lived or worked in Charlotte I'd be at this spot all the time! While walking around in search of lunch, I stumbled upon this area and was excited to have found a waterfall feature with the beautiful city in the background...until I totally started freaking out over the other little details like the interactive music poles, water misters, and stepping blocks! Made me feel like a little kid. Not to mention there's a cute garden space and plenty of open field. Yep, Charlotte knows how to provide an awesome city atmosphere. Check it out when you're nearby. :)

Before moving to Phoenix, I had taken pole fitness classes in Charleston, SC for almost 3 years. At that point, pole fitness had not only become a fun workout and part-time job (yay instructing!); it was my full-blown passion. The strength! The flexibility! The dancing! Learning to be confident and comfortable with my body! The amazing, supportive women I'd met! Spinning and hanging upside down by one leg! What wasn't to love about it?! Honestly, the only thing that could've made my experience any better was having an instructor of an even more advanced level to help me progress further, as I want to become the best pole athlete and artist I can possibly be. ENTER: Prowess Pole Fitness!   You see, for 2 years my little sister asked me to move to Tempe to be near her while she finishes grad school at ASU and although I didn't think I could just leave my life in Charleston behind, I realized two things:  1. Phoenix would be an adventure / new life experience and I'd be close to my sister for the first time in 7-8 years. 2. I could train under Lindsay Green!!! HELL YES, pack the car!   Within 3 days of my arrival, I was signed up for classes and attempting Phoenix (the pole trick, just to clarify. It was definitely out of the realm of possibility for me at the time, despite Lindsay's positive encouragement haha...) and hopping off spin poles because *holy moly* I'd only ever practiced on static and had no idea how not to get dizzy. Flash forward 9 months later and I'm holding Iron X's, spinning gracefully in Eagle, and back flipping off of poles from Brass Monkey!! (Don't understand what I'm saying? Come to class and learn our secret language!) And yes, I can Phooeenniixx! Basically, I'm learning the tricks of my dreams because Lindsay is such an awesome instructor and the queen of spotting. Seriously, even when trying a move that you are sure will lead to imminent death - she's got you! Plus, she will be your biggest cheerleader (as will all the other girls in class - because they're your new friends and family). Not only do I live for Level 3-4 and Choreography classes, but I also love Lyra, Flexibility, and Twerkshop. But wait! They offer more like Aerial Silks, Intro / Level 1-2, ChairOgraphy, Floorwork, etc. All of the instructors are really great and the studio is amaaazing (gah, those tall ceilings)!   While I can't promise that pole fitness will be the greatest life decision you will ever make for yourself (it was for me! :D), I think you should definitely try it out and see. More than once. Because let's face it, after my very 1st pole class I thought "I'm awkward, bruised, and not strong enough for this" - but continuing to practice is HOW you get strong, confident, and whatever else you want out of your journey. And please do so at Prowess because safety, form, technique, and community are so important. As for the bruises (umm, "pole kisses") and callouses? I've learned to embrace them as badges of honor.   I could honestly go on and on about how much I love Prowess and pole in general, but I'll stop. Check out their website (you must register for classes online, as there are limited spots) and even their Facebook  page so you know when the next Cirque Saturday (a showcase of instructor and student performances) is! Are you signing up? Now? GO!

One of my favorite things to do in different cities is visit breweries, so when my friends and I stopped by Mother Bunch over the weekend, I was really excited! They had a large selection of their own beers and I was impressed by how many of them sounded appealing to me. I only tried 2, but will definitely be back for a flight to try more. It had a nice atmosphere and I loved the subtle pink and green color scheme. We were really low maintenance, but our server did a great job checking in on us even though she had several other tables and a large party at the time. The garlic dip spread was delicious to share. I'd totally recommend this place and look forward to visiting again.

On Thursdays, clients can bring a new friend to the studio to try class for free! (There may be a small fee to rent a mat and towel, but you could probably use your Yelp check-in offer for that. My sister already had an extra mat and towel from home that she brought for me, so I'm not sure what the normal charge would be.)  I've never been a yoga person, as I don't enjoy the repetition, but I've taken aerial fitness classes for several years (pole, lyra, silks, flexibility) and yoga is included in our warmups a lot of the time. As a first-timer in Heated Flow, I had to peek around and copy what everyone else was doing (those guys and gals know what's up), but I was definitely thankful for my limited background knowledge, as I was mostly able to keep up with the class and didn't need any breaks. Had I been an absolute beginner, the pace would've been really fast! It's okay to lay on your mat if you need a rest though!   I'm really happy for people that love heated yoga classes (to each their own!) but to me, it just seemed like torture! Focusing on your breathing helps, but honestly, all I could think about was how freaking hot it was (96 degrees according to the thermostat). I don't like sweat dripping in my eyes and mouth while stretching. And arm balances?! Forget about it! My arms and legs were like a slip and slide. My sister even dared to say, "That was an easy class...it's usually a lot hotter!" EXCUSE ME?   It's a cute little studio with a shower in the restroom, apparel for sale, etc and I liked that they had interesting music. Throughout class, the instructor dimmed the lights so that by the end it was really dark for everyone to lay on their backs and relax (the best part of class!)   I'm glad for the life experience (and appreciate getting to take a free class with a member), but have no desire to do heated yoga again. It's just not my thing! For those of you that think sweating everything out and getting all connected to yourself is awesome, have a great time giving Sumits a try! You can get 2 weeks of unlimited classes for $20 when you first start. ;)

While I don't know if everything here is worthy of 5 stars, the Cashew Chicken that I ordered on Mother's Day was delicious and I would have given it 5 stars by itself! I had plenty leftover for lunch the following afternoon and it was just as good then. While I didn't enjoy the dish that my sister ordered as much (some kind of fried beef covered in sauce), it's one of her favorite dishes here. We had really good service despite it being a busy holiday and got free wontons in chocolate sauce at the end of our meal. The only negative aspect was that we were apparently seated right under an air conditioning vent because it was FREEZING! I overheard the table that was later seated beside us complain to the server that it was too cold, but there wasn't really anything they could or would do about it. All in all, it was one of the better Chinese/Asian restaurants I've tried since moving to Arizona.

I would give Portillo's 3.5 stars if I could, but I'm ultimately rounding up because both times that I've visited, the Italian Beef sandwich (Dipped) with sweet and spicy peppers was very good and I'd happily come back for the exact same item!   With that being said, the fries are generic and boring (in that they are the exact same frozen, crinkle-cut fries you can buy in the grocery store and make yourself). My bf ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was nothing special and "very greasy". Had he not tried 2 bites of my Italian Beef sandwich, he wouldn't have any desire to come back to Portillo's. However, he loved the beef and gravy with hot peppers and would definitely come back to get his own!

Aww, sad. I decided to try this Starbucks location today, as it's more convenient to drive to from my house, versus the Starbucks on 44th and Thomas that I normally visit. Guess I'll happily sit through multiple traffic lights in the future, because I just ordered my regular (Venti, Iced, Nonfat, Sugar-Free Vanilla Latte) and there is something very "off" about it. It does not taste good. Oh well, I tried. Would not come back, despite them having an empty drive-thru lane.
