The best Kosher style deli in town.   My fave place used to be Abe's but since they went kaput I decided it was time to give this place a shot. Boy did this place deliver. Not only was the pastrami sandwich  delicious and filling, but the sides exceeded expectation as well. Most places outside of New York don't know how to make decent potato salad or cole slaw. Miracle Mile delivered on both! (though do skip the macaroni salad, that's my one criticism).    I left feeling full and happy. If you haven't tried this place yet and are having a hankering for real New York Jewish deli food, don't bother going to any of the other places in Phoenix claiming to be New York style delis (you know who I'm talking about). Just come to Miracle Mile. It won't leave you feeling disappointed.   A note to the uninitiated: if you come here, order pastrami, corn beef, or any deli-type fare. I have no idea what their fruit salad or their pancakes taste like and you shouldn't either. Order real deli food and I guarantee you will be satisfied!

This is the best sushi I have had in AZ by far.  Sushi expert cred: I lived in Japan for three years and have eaten sushi in large cities (Tokyo) and small cities (Yonago).  This place is REAL sushi. If you want fried cream cheese in your sushi go elsewhere. The owner is a man from Kyoto and he isn't doing much pandering to American palates.  The highlight of this place is the actual quality of the fish. The nigiri sushi is what you should order so you can fully appreciate the flavor and texture. I'd recommend the unagi, the salmon, and the escolar to get you started. All exquisite.

Really impressed with the selection on this Indian buffet.  It's rare to find Tikka Masala right next to a Makhani.  Not only that, but the buffet is available for dinner.  Also, the mango lassi (not included in the buffet) was exquisite (if not a bit on the small side).  The only thing that keeps this place from getting a fifth star is that you can get better tasting versions of the dishes offered on the buffet from other, non-dinner buffet Indian restaurants.  That's my one complaint.  Overall, I was very impressed and will be coming back here next time I've got a hankering for Indian.

The shumai and bbq ribs! And beef and broccoli! Even some of the sushi was decent. And they had real ice cream! Teriyaki chicken! And chicken wings! And chicken on a stick! And potstickers with the perfect sauce! This is where I'll come from now on when I want to eat greasy Chinese until my stomach hurts.

I don't know how this place has only 3.5 stars. If you're giving them 2 stars because it isn't the style of bbq you're used to, please shut up. That's a personal preference, not a knock on the food or service they deliver. Judge the place based on how close they meet the mark of what they're aiming for. As far as I'm concerned this is exactly the place I want to come to when I've got a craving for some bbq. The flavor is great, the sauces are good, the variety is all you could ask for and the portions leave me feeling stuffed. I got the front porch and each item was pleasing: Fall of the bone ribs, flavor packed sausage, juicy chicken (the dark meat anyway...white meat was a bit dry). I reserve the 5th star partly for the white meat, partly for the mediocre mac and cheese and partly because I have had better bbq sauce and find that I only really enjoy the "original" sauce out of the three offered. Other places have more sauce options and I like more of said options. Minor criticisms.

This place has sub-par rolls, mediocre fish quality and overpriced everything. I haven't tried their meat dishes so maybe that's why people love this place but as far as sushi goes, I would not go here again.

The employees are generally not knowledgable.  And worse, they often spread misinformation.  I have often been the recipient of odd, false rumors about future products and been advised incorrectly about current products.  Low level employees are usually pleasant to chat with and share opinions regarding games they enjoy. Managers, however, are often rude and condescending if you don't want to pre-order things.  Avoid Gamestop if possible.

Do you want the best bagel in The Valley? Well I found it for you and now you can reap the benefits. After living in Phoenix for almost two decades I have officially found a round piece of dough with a hole in the middle that deserves to be called a BAGEL. For many years I could only get my bagel fix when traveling back to New York to visit friends or family. But now finally I have found a shop in Phoenix that has not only the proper taste but also the proper texture/consistency of a New York bagel. Don't bother with other imposters claiming to have "New York style bagels."  This is the only real deal in the Phoenix metro area.

This is exactly the kind of breakfast place you want! The place is named Biscuits so I was pleased when the biscuits lived up to my expectations. The strawberry preserves are heavenly and could (and should) be spread on anything you can find! The sausage gravy on my chicken fried chicken was thick and flavorful. Finally, the eggs were a perfectly cooked over-easy. If this place wasn't a five star breakfast spot before, it became one when they brought out complimentary chocolate covered strawberries!   I'll be back here very soon!

Found this place in a roundabout way through Yelp. They agreed to deliver slightly outside their delivery area for me.  I am a big fan of their egg foo young. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the area.

Tried the Yatai Food Truck for the first time today.  I'd heard about them but was never in the right place at a convenient time to catch them.  Boy am I impressed.  This is the way the broth should taste in a bowl of tonkotsu ramen.  For me, it's the broth that makes or breaks the dish.  This broth has been cooked for 20 hours and you can really tell.  The flavor is rich.  This is the only bowl of ramen I've found in Phoenix that even gets close to true tonkotsu ramen the way it's served in Hakata on Kyushu.  If I had one bit of constructive criticism I would like the broth to be a little bit thicker in terms of the texture, just my personal preference.  As far as I'm concerned this place sets the bar for ramen in Phoenix.  If your establishment can't meet or exceed this level of deliciousness, just give up and stop serving ramen.      Can't wait to get another bowl from Yatai Food Truck!

I've eaten here about 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  Everything I've tried is great. From the spicy soup to the bahn mi to the saigon roll, I haven't really had any items on the menu that are bad.  The fake meat, while not likely to fool meat eaters, tastes very good in its own right.  The chicken is especially tasty.  I can't wait to try all the rest of the offerings.  All vegan restaurants should be this high quality!
