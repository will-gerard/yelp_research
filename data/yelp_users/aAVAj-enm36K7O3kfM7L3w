Per evening news this place will close its doors today March 26, in t-minus 5 minutes. Wish I could have visited them in their heyday.

My Groupon says "The amount paid for this voucher ($10.00) with Delia's Cleaners NEVER EXPIRES." Apparently, the manager at this location has no idea what that means...smh...Another Delia's mgr is trying to help out. We'll see what happens :/ I'm not holding my breath.

I haven't been roller skating in ages.  Maaaaaaaaannnnnn this brought back some memories. The old skates I borrowed were surprisingly tuned up pretty well so kudos for that. I look forward to going for a 9:30p sess next time. Also,  even though the dj didn't play my song -_-  there were very age appropriate choices played for the crowd.  I look forward to going back soon.

I give you a 5 star just for at least attempting to honor my expired Groupon that said I could use it for the dollar amount I originally paid instead of doing nothing, like all but one of your other locations acted.  Not sure about your cleaning services, but customer service is very good. Thank you.

For cheap pizza Domino's is alright in my book. Both this location and the one on Northern and 51st are my go to locations, but for flavor this location on Glendale and 35th still comes out ahead. Maybe the ovens are more seasoned or something. So far, my experiences here have been above board and the biiiiiig plus is you can do carry-out without leaving the comfort of your own car. Bonus!!!

I always choose to drive past the ghetto TB at 4402 W Glendale in Glendale to eat at the nicer location at 35th and Glendale Ave in Phoenix. It's right next to QT. This location deserves 5 stars just on customer service alone!!! Someone I met that used to work at both locations agreed with me that things are run a lot differently in Glendale than they are in Phoenix.

Freshest cilantro, radishes, greens and onions. The quality of limes seems a bit inconsistent. They have the cheapest bottled water. The smell when you walk in is a little off. One day it smelled like wet dog :/ I can't complain too much since it's the closest grocer to my neighborhood and the customer service is very good compared to other places I do food shopping. Even the security guard was nice even though I had "don't mess with me" face on......hahaha :) Therefore, F.C. I will bump your stars from 3 to 4.

The green tea mousse wasn't here today 05/19/15 :( :( :( :( :( which is the only reason I stopped by today so I opted for green tea leche instead :/ I highly doubted it would be as yummmmmmmmsssss as the mousse and I was unfortunately correct :/  Why oh why did you stop making the green tea mousse,  Arai? It was the reason I fell in love with you (ehem...referring to the desserts;) in the first place. My friend from out of town also fell in love with your little shop because of the green tea mousse. I hope you bring it back.  Yours is the only shop of its kind around these parts. 5 stars once green tea mousse graces us with its presence again.

Hello Arai. We meet again ;) I docked you 1 star in my last review because my beloved green tea mousse was not available. Only the cakes were for sale. Disappointment set in my heart and I took it out on you but alas, I must concede. It was not you, *sigh and a teardrop* it was me. It truly was my own conceit that caused me to think you were only making delectable little pastries for me.......  During my last visit (though not recorded I've been here at least 6 times and counting) I was kindly reminded if I call a couple days ahead then the green tea mousse can be put on the menu that week.   WHA-WHAAAT!!!! SCREECH!! BACKUP!!! How did I forget that scrumptuous little bit of information?  Oh! Arai Pastry Shop, you are making pastries just for lil' ol' meeeeeeeee!!! At least that's how we all should feel when we visit our local bake shop. So, I will continue to gladly drop some major coin on these tasty dollops of heaven when I make the trip across town. I hope you have continued success Arai!!!!

Some of the best prices I've seen in this little store for Japanese staples like rice wine vinegar, hoisin, etc. Check out the frozen food and small cooler up front for freshly made bentos.  Every one is always so polite. This little corner grocer holds its own.

Very good. Super busy for lunch like every shop on this little corner. Homemade soups and chili. Stop in for a quick bite.  5 stars due to excellent customer service.  A beef soup I bought contained no beef. If I'd been driving I would have turned around and had my cup of deliciousness replaced with something else but I wasn't so I called and the man (manager) that answered took down my name and said to stop in later for a refund or to try something else. Well sooner turned into later, but guess what!!!! They still had my name posted and I was able to try another dish plus I purchased another while there.  I try to stop in whenever I'm on this side of town.

So far, only ordered late night using their awesome app!!! Orders have been correct everytime I pickup. One time they made a fresh pie for me before I arrived instead of trying to pass off the wrong one to me. Honesty and customer service goes a long way with me.

I love this place! Star off for one thing: the homemade sauce needs to be mixed with ketchup IMO to make it taste right. Other than that the ground beef tacos, stewed chicken tacos and fish tacos and OMG the beans are all legit! Plus their open all day...can I get a What Whaaaaat?!?!! :D :D hehehe

Bought the big bowl o' refried beans and they ended up making friends with the hard shell T Bell taco and said, "Hey! I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number. So, call me maybe.".......and call he did. #sacreligous? I think not. #nomnomnoms. ;) :p ;)

I am lovin' El Pollo Loco. Muuuuuch better than the local colonel imho. All of their salads are very good. My food has always been fresh, including the salads. Service could have been a little tighter at times, but it seems like most people like working there and working with each other which shows in the quality of the food. Overall I am pleased with this restaurant.

HING LOON. TAKE 2. I threw caution to the wind and went against my norm to order only soup and eggrolls only before trying entrees.  1st was the combination fried rice (a.k.a. house fried rice). It was very tasty and not overly salty....yay!!! Remember kids you can add salt, but you can't take it out ;-) That's why God made soy sauce packets. My 1st bite transported me back to an old favorite spot back East that my family frequented when I was a kid......ahhhhh memories :)  2nd on the docket was chicken with broccoli (+ onion and carrot) and it too was delish and 'so fresh and so clean, clean' ^-^.  Riddle me this why no duck sauce? I wonder what you put on your eggroll? Hmmmm.....must investigate that next.  Overall, compared to another local establishment up the street, I am highly impressed and think you should be too. I give Hing Loon a high 5 today!

So, I just moved to the area and had a hankering for some Chinese food. What was a girl to do, but consult my trusty Yelp! app and see where it led me. Wel-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l......I must say this is the first time I feel like I've been led astray.  You see, my go to whenever visiting a new Chinese place is a soup and a rice dish. I mean if a Chinese restaurant can't get that right then there's no way anything else I order is going to be any good. That philosophy hasn't let me down yet......hmmmmm now if there was just someway to apply that to relationships and I'd be a millionaire.........  But, I digress..... back to the food. My no flavor won ton soup was full of ribbons of pork fat (no meat) that still had the veins running through it......blech!!! The house fried rice tasted like old pork, dried-out old chicken, old shrimps mixed with rice that had been fried up in at least 2 month old oil. To make sure I gave this place a fair shake I did refridgerate and attempt to eat the food the next, but to no avail I still began to feel ill immediately after.  Now don't get me wrong. I believe all of the opinions about this place are true. But, I also think the lovely folks that live around this neighborhood must have iron-clad stomachs or they have been fed so much bad Chinese food it's been determined that this place is good. It's all relative????..maybe????? Unfortunately, the food I was served was illness-inducing. That's the only way I can honestly describe it.  In fact, the following day I felt so sick after taking just a few bites of rice that, out of curiosity, I decided to check out the Dirty Diner report so I could find out if there were any Chinese restaurants around here worth going to. To my shock, but not surprise Ming Gee was at the top of the list for multiple violations. Many of the violations for things that would cause a person to have food poisoning. And that is why for the first time in my life I threw away $20 worth of food with no regrets.  To add insult to injury I too was charged this mysterious 12% another Yelper mentioned in a previous post. Funny....when I took my total pre-tax bill and multiplied by 12% my handy-dandy little calculator showed I should have paid more than what I paid. Then I thought maybe they're taxing more the dish that contains shrimp, but even that did not add up.   p.s. I waited a few weeks to write this review to see if any other reviews showed up. WHY???? Because there has been a big, fat CLOSED sign on the front door for at least the last week. So-o-o-o-o-o-o my question is how is it a few people have eaten at this restaurant in the last 2 days when the place hasn't been open within the last 2 days?.......hmmmmmm?????  Bottom Line: I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone. You are risking your health by eating there IMHO. Also, if their doors do open again expect to pay a higher amount than whatever total you are given online or over the phone.

An urgent care center open on Sunday?!? Sold!!! While out of town I went in for some help with a sinus and ear infection and came out with the home remedies and RXs I needed. Unfortunately, the antibiotic was too strong for me and I could not finish it. I know that's a no-no and yes I followed up with a local doctor when I got home ;p

Hello my old friend D.D.,  How've things been? Fine, I hope.  It seems I caught you on an off day today (3/19 @ 11:25a) when I stopped by to pickup a light and flaky, buttery croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg.   The reason I say that, you see, is because out of all the years I've visited you across the nation I've never been served a sandwich on bread that was not cooked through.  Yes, I mean raw and doughy bread. You made a good showing by toasting the outside well but the inside was like Play-Doh. It was so disappointing since this was my 1st meal of the day. :( :( :(  The other egregious thing I found wrong with my sandwich is the egg literally desintegrated in my mouth like Jell-O. At first I thought I was imagining things but soon discovered the entire egg, yolk and all, had this strange consistency.......smh.....If I wasn't on my way to work I would have braved the horrendous traffic and driven back to have the sandwich remade.  On a good note, the gals did get my request for a cup of hot water right.....after the second try. *sigh*  I just hope someone at your location takes these  YELP! reviews seriously. It's so sad especially since this location has such good reviews. If I'm in the area I might stop by and check how you're doing, but this was such a disappointing experience I think I'll drive the extra couple miles and visit that other fast food place that offers croissants ;) or just visit the next closest Dunkin Donuts.  If my experience improve I'll update this review.

So far, so good with this location. Everyone I've dealt with late night and afternoon have been very courteous even with my special orders (i.e. no ice, sauce on the side, etc).  For what you'd expect from a fast food place I give them a 5 star right now. Note: just like most establishments in the area there are plenty of panhadlers around, but I haven't been bothered by the ones around this restaurant yet. Hope I didn't "jinx" myself by saying that...lollololol. Just kidding. Maybe I'm not kidding. Wait! Yes I am just kidding. :D  Anyway, check 'em out for freshly fried treats, cool salads (if you're into that;), and Frosties when you're in the area.

No matter if I visit in the morning, afternoon or evening this Burger King is excellent in their display of professionalism, customer service and courtesy. It seems they have a very good management team here.  Their local burger competition has a thing or two to learn. Stand back, Ronald!!!There's a new king in town!!!

*sigh*  :/ Why oh WHY do I torture myself by going to this Mcdonald's?......I would like to say I will never visit this location ever again, but how can I. I mean it's McDonald's whadda ya expect? But seriously? Words cannot describe how poorly each of my 3 visits went. 3 strikes aaaaand your OUT!  Now I fully understand where comedians get their material from when they throw shade on Mikky D's inept employees, mediocre service, and crappie intercom.  On a funnier side, the voice coming out of the intercom DOES really sound like Charlie Brown's teacher! Ya know the sound wah-wah wah wah wah-wah wah.LOL :D I could hardly believe it. At 1st I thought I was being punked. Ashton where are you when we need you?

A bit pricey for a bagel place. But as they say you get what you pay for. Since this is a one-of-a-kind gem with all the unusual flavors of bagels and cream cheese I'd say go here often if you wanna splurge. If not, then stop in early and  check out the discount basket.

Called in take out, arrived@ 11:30a, waited in line @ least 30 min. By then fries & hot dog were no longer hot. Place needs takeout window or better time management for busy times of day. Giving 4 stars due to overall freshness of ingredients.

On a couple Groupons and a prayer I decided to try this place out.  First of all every meal is made to order, including the sushi. Also, the miso soup (which I usually hate) was quite, quite tasty. Did order the fillet cooked medium and it was very good and tender. I must say I agree with a recent YELPER that the sauce paired with the steak was not a good fit. It was overly salty for my taste (maybe that was to make up for lack of salt on meat?).  As other Yelpers have duly noted the tataki is to die for. Also, it seems the entire staff there has memorized the menu as if it were the Bible. The speaks to how well  management has trained their staff.  Since I am a sucker for excellent customer service I made sure to give R. A. a perfect YELP score. My score is really more like a ten, but there's not enough stars to do that :)   All in all I enjoyed my visits to R.A. tremendously and will definitely be back again and refer others!  p.s. I love the fact there is a wide variety of folks there from all dressed up to jean shorts and Tishri you'll be treated the same.

You can't get much more authentic than this place!!!! I dare you to try and find a restaurant that brings the flavors of Cuba to Glendale better than this restaurant.  Primero: el cafe Cubano...*check *  Segundo: la ensalada mixta...do not ask where the dressing is. It's already tossed in it and is very refreshing.  Tercero: los moros y cristianos...all fully cooked but a little on the dry side for my taste but the flavor was still there.  Cuarto: el pescado...on point  Quinto: los postres.....aaaaaahhhhh :) :) :)....los postres. Don't ask. Just eat whatever looks good to you and if you can't decide just buy 1 of each para llevar. They are all verrrry good and you will not be disappointed.  Sexto (Yes. That's how you spell it) :p Do not be afraid to use your spanish to order your food. The nice young lady who's running around like a chicken with its head cut off will understand what you want.  I WILL definitely be back. As at any small restaurant everyone is welcome, but repeat customers treated con un poco más cariño.  Buen provecho!

There are so many old reviews here I feel compelled to write my own. This was my go to place for pretty much everything from groceries to electronics from 2012-2013. You would see my ugly mug in there at least 3-5 times a month.  I rate a 5 for the following reasons: to help even out the score, and it seems a few other reviews were not written as objectively as they could've been.  Anywhoooooo.....Based on multiple visits sometimes finding items I wanted was hit or miss, but like their website says the store will sometimes sell out of a product and not replace it. Overall, I like this Wal-Mart better than the one on Rittenhouse in Q.C. because there aren't as many seedy-looking individuals hanging around outside.  I cannot comment on auto service, but shelving seemed well stocked in that area.  I would recommend this Wal-mart because, well, it's the only one in San Tan...hehe ;p....also if you are food shopping and want to get in and out shop after 9 so you don't have to contend with all the soccer moms.

This is Puerto Rican soul food at its best!!!   When I used to live on that side of town a few years ago I frequented this little gem a couple times and am still dreaming about the tostones (flattened and fried plátano) with garlic mojo sauce (garlic, olive oil, seasoning). OMG!!!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. *licks lips*  This little bit of heaven along with a healthy portion of pernil (if you don't know; you better aaasssk somebody;) con some pollo asado y arroz con gandules.......yummi yummi yummmmms!!!  Ay!!!! Mi madre!!! Seriously, this could be my last meal and I'd die a very happy chica.  I hope one day they can expand. But until then I will gladly make the drive to Millie's in Mesa.

Gave it 4 stars because of server-Bill.  He seemed genuinely interested in making sure everyone was happy with their meals.  Also, I like the fact you can do half french fries half sweet potato fries. I ordered the New York Burger. There's some really sweet chow chow on there.  Word to the wise it tastes better when there's a sufficient amount of dill pickles to counteract the sweetness.

The nighttime manager at this E Main location ROCKS AND is to be commended for customer service.  Reason: bought a rotten tamal from the Filibertos on N Power, but did not notice 'til I almost had almost reached the next Filibertos on E Main.  Even though each of these locations are managed by different people the manager on E Main made things right by letting trade in the rotten one for a fresh one.  I really see no reason to try the Filibertos on S Power again.  I don't care how new of a restaurant you have you should never sell something rotten.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the E Valley area and going to Filibertos go to the one at 64th and E Main.

Allison's gives Mesa a taste of Texas right here in the far E. Valley. This being my first visit I went for the gusto and ordered the 3 meats with 2 sides platter which consisted of 1/4 chicken, pork ribs and sliced brisket + cole slaw and corn soufflé.  Another person in my party tried the pulled pork which literally melts in your mouth. The brisket was tasty and had a good looking smoke ring from the on-site smoker. The pork ribs (which btw had a very good amount of meat on both sides of the bone) had a peppercorn dry rub on it. My chicken was unbelievably moist and looked like something out of a magazine.   In my opinion the corn souffle was the big winner.  I did find out the only dairy the soufflé contains is butter. Since that is the only dairy I can eat without much of reaction that was music to my ears. The cole slaw has pickle relish in it which was a tad strange to me, but even stranger was it had a yeasty taste to it so I did not finish eating it.....hmmmm not sure why and I did not ask, but mental notes have been made to  "Just say No to the slaw" next time round.   The bearded man who took my order was knowledgeable about how all of the foods I asked him about were made so that was encouraging.  If you want sauce there 3 to pick from on the table: sassy, spicy and sweet. The sweet is verrrry sweet in my opinion, but when I mixed it with sassy it paired quite nicely with the ribs. You can tell they're all made in house.   All in all I enjoyed my eating experience and tunes playing on Pandora?  So, based off this visit they deserve a solid 4. The bathroom (I visited) was clean and the floors, dining tables and chairs were not sticky or icky. Interestingly, it looks like the décor was not quite finished because 2 walls have an industrial/country thing going on while the corner walls where the only booth sits appears to have been overlooked...weird. The plaza in which this restaurant is located is an ok neighborhood, for the area..... btw...I did notice a coin laundry a few doors down so you can do your wash and get your grub on at the same time. Talk about multitasking.    Service was given with a smile and  we were welcomed back. Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

If you forgot cash just use the Chase atm located inside. The workers here have always been courteous regardless of what day or time I visit. Haven't noticed any panhandlers loitering around which is a plus. All in all good location and consistently has cheapest prices in town.

Go eat here. It's better priced than other sandwich shops cookies and bars are freshly just like homemade and melt in your mouth.  Next time will try their sandwiches instead of just dessert.

This only my 2nd time visiting because I'm like most people and 1-2 paychecks away from being put out on the streets.  Otherwise, I would be here at least 2-3 times a week. Yes that's how much a good quality food restaurant is worth visiting.  This time I called ahead my togo order and also took the advice of one of the owners and ordered the fried rice (I had the house style which has Chinese sausage.....yummo:).  All I have to say is where have you been all my Arizona life?   And to top things off (literally) there was a little bit of freshly chopped cilantro on top to set off the rest of the flavors.  One thing I liked is the girl taking my order was sure to let me know my food would be made fresh so it be ready in about 15 minutes and it was. Thank you . Side not: someone forgot to remove the shrimp shell from my rice before serving it. I guess that's better than finding a hair, right? Anywho, I ate at least half my rice before heading home!!! Talk about feeding a craving.  Bomboba I will be back soon as soon as the budget allows. Until then my friend...until then.  Side note 1: for those who are a litte impatient...remember "Good things come to those who wait"  Side note 2: There's board games and Jenga you can play while you're at the restaurant. Now look me in the eye and tell me that's not cool and hip. That's cool and hip right there. I don't care what anybody says.  Side note 3: The rice is pretty oily as my stomach told me later, but it is FRIED rice sooooooooo

The event as a whole was so so so so bad and poorly excecuted. All I can say is ditto to all the other reviews.  Whoever organized this event should be ashamed of themselves. Or as Trump would have said, You're fired!
