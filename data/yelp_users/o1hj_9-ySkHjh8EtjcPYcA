"Good Food and Prices for Vegas"    Of course, the food costs more than your neighborhood take-out but this is Vegas and this restaurant is on the casino floor. The food comes out fast and although some of the dishes are small for the price ($18.50 for Kung Pao Chicken - chicken only) pair it with a noodle dish and it is plenty of food for two people. The staff is excellent and very customer oriented. We have been there twice and have not been disappointed.

Yes.  I love this joint. Incredible pizza and my personal favorite quinoa salad with white beets (thought I hated beets until I tried this version),goat cheese and pistachios. De-licious!  Hubby gets to eat the various pies and sandwiches and I get my favorite salad with a nice glass of merlot for only $5.   Nice ambiance and great service. Another one if my Fox favorites.

What can I say about one of the best hotels on the strip besides it is luxurious! I married my honey on March 1 and although we plan to go to Italy next year we were pressed with time so we decided to go to Vegas with a couple of friends and stay at the Palazzo Resort. WOW - We knew it would be great because we had been to the Venetian in January and all I can say is that it did not disappoint.  The place is still fresh and the rooms feel like new - not sure if they have been redone but unlike some Vegas Star hotels who tend to get shabby, the Palazzo has kept up with their decor and room amenities.   The sunken living room makes the stay seem like you have booked an apartment rather than just a room. The Internet works well. unlike the connections we have experienced in other places.   Although you can walk to a few other casinos in the area, we were content to move between the Palazzo and the Venetian except for the early mornings where we went down to Fremont so my husband could play craps on the cheaper tables, $5 as opposed to the minimum $10 and up on weekends. As a slot player, the Venetian and Palazzo had plenty of machines that perked my interest and took my money but hey - I really don't go to win. LOL It is a rare occasion when that happens at all. I go for the fun.  Many great places to eat - Noodle Asia comes to mind - a new one we tried this trip.   As we exited the Palazzo to pick up our car I noticed a sign that said $9.99 breakfast so the 4 of us opted to go into Dal Toro Ristorante and were quite impressed by the delicious breakfast with eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast, pancakes - yummy. Put that in my data bank for future stops!  All in all another great trip and we are looking forward to returning next month! Yeah!

Messed up chicken and waffles. This crap was on the chicken. GROSS.  Stay away. It sucks.  This dish is great if you ate 300 pounds and want to stay that way.

Really enjoy the vibe here. It is always busy and on weekends reservations are almost always necessary, The food is priced well and there is a decent variety. Weekends they serve breakfast all day, which is great when you get up late or live out in the East Valley.  They changed the chicken and waffles. See latest review.

The place might look like a cafeteria but they serve up some tasty morsels. Although I was afraid to order the eggplant parmigiana sandwich on ciabatta bread it did not disappoint. Lightly breaded eggplant arugula burrata and pesto made this an excellent choice. Hubby went with his usual meatballs and loved it. $50 with onion rings tip and tax. A Vegas bargain.

Who doesn't like a Connecticut lobster roll with a side of lobster mac and cheese. DUH!  Can it ever be bad! Good stuff. Go there.

If you are looking for authentic Puerto Rican food, you can't go wrong here. The place is small and the owner makes you feel as though you are eating in his kitchen. His friendly attitude makes the food taste that much better. Nice portion sizes  are a bonus. The pulled pork was amazing and we had plenty of leftovers for dinner.
