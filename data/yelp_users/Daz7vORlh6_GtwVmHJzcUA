Showed up at 8:10 pm on a Saturday night. There were three larger parties (about 8 people each) seated; otherwise the place was mostly empty. Two waitresses ignored us, one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed.   After waiting for about five minutes, I asked one of the waitresses about being seated. She said she would get a hostess.   The hostess comes out and explained that we wouldn't be seated for about 30 minutes because of the large party that just arrived. Because the restaurant was about 70% empty and they wouldn't seat us, we left.   I realize that this restaurant was featured on the Food Network so I'm assuming the food is great; however, if a hostess doesn't seat guests in a nearly-empty restaurant, I also assume they don't want to serve us.

Every time I go, the food is incredible. The service is great!   For those other reviews: yep, it's diner food. If you're prone to indigestion or other gastric ailments, you may not want the chorizo burro. But there's something for everyone here.

After going to a Rally's regularly when I lived in Indiana, I was excited to see one of these in Tempe. However, my excitement was tempered over several visits.  First of all, if you're not familiar with Rally's, it is drive-up and walk-up only, with no inside dining. If you are not sitting at one of the few patio tables with umbrellas, you're gonna get it to go.  The fries can be some of the best around. However, they can also be less than desirable, who knows what changes their quality from visit to visit. The burgers can range from really good to almost crappy. Once again, I haven't figured out why they change so much. Service is consistent, though. Consistently slow.  I'm not saying stay away...but if you go, expect slower service than many fast food places, and inconsistent food quality.

After church on Sunday, my wife brought me to Zamora's, saying that she really liked it. After I left, I was also a huge fan.  The chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had. The salsa had a decent amount of heat, but not too much. The chips were also done to perfection. We both had tacos, containing really great shredded beef. The tostadas and enchiladas are pretty tasty, as well.  They have lunch specials 7 days a week, and I believe I saw dinner specials as well.  Talking to one of the employees on the way out, it sounds like their business has dropped off because of all the business closures in that area. Folks, do not let this place go away...it is a hidden treasure.

After reading the other reviews, here are some things you need to know.  - There are many different sauces for the wings. If something is too hot: get a different sauce the next time. - This is a sports bar. It's built around sports, wings, and alcohol. It is NOT a romantic spot, a high class restaurant, or a place to have deep conversation. On the other hand, if you want to watch a game, play trivia, and hang out in a loud bar, you've found home. - The staff at this location are friendly and professional, and work their butts off. Any bar that doesn't let me go thirsty has earned my business.

I have been to CK's several times. The service is great, and the pub grub is some of the best. We had the raspberry boneless wings for the first time last night, and they were awesome! A little breading, good raspberry sauce, with just the right amount of heat.  Good service, low prices, and big portions. Like Debbie, I also wished I lived closer.

I've been here a couple of times, but was reminded of them when I got one of their scones at a booth set up at Race for the Cure. The scones are less of a solid mass that you get at some other places, but more flaky. Very, very nice! Add some cream cheese and I'm a happy guy.  They are known for bread, of course...but if you need a meal, don't neglect the entrees. Very reasonably priced, and fare that tends to be a little different than the average restaurant. The spinach and artichoke heart lasagna that I had the last time was great.  I keep forgetting about this place for some reason...but if you haven't been, check 'em out.

As someone that grew up in NY state, restaurants touting themselves as NY style aren't going to immediately impress me. However, these guys are doing things right. Went as part of a decent-sized group (about 20 people) for a tweet-up...service was great, and the calzone that I had was pretty good.   This location doesn't have a ton of seating, but carryout is available.

We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate, so we went out to see if they were any good.  We visited just before Christmas...so I can't recall specifics. However, the food was decent. Nothing spectacular, but wasn't bad either. The real turnoff here was the service. Slow. Really slow...and this was on a night that had about 6 tables seated.   What really stuck in my mind was the 10 minutes and two requests it took to get my credit card back from the waiter when I paid. The last request he looked at me like "whaddya want?"   We will not be back.

My wife and I have been here several times over the past few years. We return because of these reasons: great cocktails, great service, and cuisine not seen other places in Phoenix.   Tonight we had a cucumber cooler, a Santa Rosa, Moroccan meatballs, and vegetarian stuffed peppers. Everything was executed perfectly including the service. We'll be back!

We went here on Cinco de Mayo. Fortunately, I was able to make a reservation for 4 two hours in advance.  When we got there and found that the food was Southwestern/New Mexico style instead of Mexican, I had mixed emotions. On the one hand, Yelp said this was Mexican food, and it was definitely New Mexico-inspired, Hatch chile-laden cuisine. However, we just got back from Santa Fe and Albuquerque a few weeks ago and were eager to get some more of the cuisine we had there.  I have two friends that ripped Blue Adobe Grill to shreds with their reviews, mostly because of the service. Fortunately, I didn't have 30 people in my party, so the service was a bit better. But to say it was great would definitely be lying. Service was slow but adequate...and probably cost this rating the fifth star.  But the food was absolutely incredible. All four of us were impressed! The chiles made the food spicy hot...but not at the expense of flavor. The meats in our dishes were incredibly tender, including the shrimp in my enchilada. Shrimp is so often overcooked and tough...but not this dish.  Additionally...some of the best chips and salsa you'll ever eat is right here.   If you're used to Taco Bell...skip this place. But if you like good food, spicy food, and don't mind being a little patient with service...this is the place.

We heard that this bar shows UFC events without a cover charge...they just request that you spend $15 per person. Not a problem for me. With a deal like this, we went back.  Anyhoo, this time, we stuck to wings, appetizers, and beer. I have to say that I'm now a fan of their wings. We got BBQ, Garlic Parmesean, and the classic Buffalo flavors. The wings are definitely the biggest I've seen, and the flavors are awesome!  They have also made a few upgrades to the decor inside...a lot more attractive. We will be back!

I really don't know how I lived in this neighborhood for this long...and didn't realize Flavors of Louisiana was here.  OK, that's not entirely true. This place is tucked in a little strip mall next to the LA Fitness place next to Walmart. If you aren't looking for it, you won't find it.  But you need to find this place. Quickly. This place serves incredibly tasty Cajun food. My wife used to live in SE Texas and says it's as authentic as you'll get.  As other reviewers have already noted, this place won't overwhelm you with ambiance. Which is just fine, because you're here for the food. We had catfish, alligator tails, shrimp, dirty rice, and red beans and rice. It was all fresh, cooked to perfection, and was enhanced by the real Louisiana Hot Sauce. If you like tartar sauce and get fish, make sure you get some of their Cajun tartar sauce. Good stuff, Maynard.  Tip: we got there about 11:30am, and had no trouble finding a seat. But this place gets crazy busy for lunch. Come at noon, and you might want to get it to go.  Tip #2: this isn't a budget place to get food. Po' Boys run about $10, and my plate was $14. But it's worth it. Save up and splurge on great food.

After being fitted for running shoes at a former competitors' store, I know how important it is to buy from a store that has knowledgeable staff. I heard of Sole Sports when I did the 3 Day Breast Cancer Walk...and decided to drive from the West Valley because there are no decent stores out here.  I will tell you it was worth the drive and then some. We were lucky enough to have Katie work with us, and found the right pair of shoes for both of us. Not only did she do the gait analysis, but she also gave us a ton of options and took her time.  Knowledgeable staff and a company that supports the community gets my business every time. Thanks, Katie!

We had not visited a Ruby Tuesday since 2006 when I visited the (now closed) location on University and Mill in Tempe. When I walked into this one, I wondered if it was the same place.  The neighborhood watering hole feel of the old Ruby Tuesdays has been replaced by more contemporary, slightly upscale furnishings including comfy chairs and artwork. The salad bar is still there, though, and looked great.  One look at the menu and you know it has changed -- for the better. They still have the great burgers, but they have been banished to the back cover of the menu. The emphasis is now on healthier but substantial fare like small steaks, seafood, and chicken.  I had the dockside grill trio, including a small skewer of grilled shrimp, salmon, and spicy tilapia with mango salsa. This entree comes with rice and one side. I was disappointed to hear they didn't have the spaghetti squash, but opted for the mashed cauliflower. Good stuff.  My wife had the petite sirloin and fried shrimp. The shrimp were coated in a cornmeal-type batter with some Cajun spice. Great job done preparing it.  The service was friendly and efficient. We'll definitely be back!

I've had two experiences that have shaped my feelings about this store. The last one ensures I will not shop there again.  The first one is a good experience. We buy large, expensive bags of cat food. About halfway through a bag that we bought from there, the food went rancid; you could smell the acrid odor a mile away. The woman working there was kind enough to give me a full bag free in exchange for the half bag. Great service!  However, they do not keep this particular food in stock, so we have to order it every time. I ordered a bag on a Wednesday, and was told it would be there the following Wednesday. My wife calls on the day it's supposed to be ready, only to be told to check back Thursday or Friday.  Friday comes around, and she goes to the store to pick it up. When she goes to pick it up, they have a bag, but is told by a male employee that it's already promised to someone else who called on Saturday.   At this point, we are out of cat food, and have to drive to Surprise to another store that keeps it in stock. A huge inconvenience for us.  So. If they have it in stock? Sure. Special orders? Forget about it. Too slow, and unreliable.

After receiving a coupon, we stopped in to check it out.  The weights for each of the burgers are now listed. Someone said that $3.99 was pricey for a 1/4 lb burger, and if you compare it to McDonalds it might be. But this place grinds their own meat from a specific group of ranches, and after tasting it I will tell you that it's well worth the price! Cooking the burgers over a wood fire also gives them a great flavor. They now put lettuce and tomato on burgers free of charge, so the shredded lettuce is no longer there.  The fries are also unique and outstanding. From their menu, they use Yukon Golds and fry them in rice oil with duck fat. The flavor is incredible, and when you use their fry sauce...well, I couldn't stop eating them.  My wife tried a couple of the sweet potato fries and liked them too.  They now have a TV in the small dining area that is usually tuned to sports.  We will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place to anyone that loves burgers!

We were tired and searching for a place to eat while visiting a friend at PCH. While driving around, we found this place.  I am not sure why this place is called a pizzeria; it is more along the lines of a decent Italian restaurant. They have pizza, but you are not going to want to get take out for a family of 6 on a limited budget.  What an incredible find! We love Italian food, and this place rocked. Like another reviewer, our waitress was Josephine, and she was incredible. Kept our glasses filled with iced tea, personable, friendly, and helpful. She said she is Sicilian, and moved to Arizona after living in New York.  I had the Spaghetti Bolonese, and my wife had the Margherita Pizza. Both incredible. They have a wood-fired oven with a brick floor...made the pizza and the bread incredible!  My wife has Italian ancestry, and has been to Italy. She claims the food, including the pizza, is as close to authentic as she's seen in the states.  The price is reasonable, but it's not fast food. Entrees were around $12-18 each, pizzas were under $10.

We went here for a romantic date night...and loved it.   The waitress others have written about may appear to be a bit curt with her conversation at first...but after joking around for a minute she opened up and was very personable. Regardless, she refilled our drinks quickly, provided great menu guidance, and I had no complaints.  The food is pretty darn tasty. The bread with pimento dip was stellar! The pear and walnut salad was great. We also had a seafood pasta special and one other dish.   The clientele when we visited seemed a bit older, and the piano player added to the ambiance of a restaurant of 30 years ago when dining was a bit more of an experience.   We will be back, for sure!

I used to live in the Midwest and had more than my share off Coney island hotdogs. This place is the real deal. Great frankfurters with a snap because if natural casings, great chili, and the right type of onions make for a great experience at this place.   Only one problem with this place: it's too far away. Come out to Avondale!

This is one of the best pho places in Arizona. Broth is fresh and has a great flavor.
