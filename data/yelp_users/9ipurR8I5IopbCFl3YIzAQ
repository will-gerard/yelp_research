So you're out with friends. One of you is craving sushi. The other wants a juicy burger. Look no further than Delux. This trendy centrally located restaurant has delicious grass-fed burgers and a halfway decent wine list. I've never had their sushi so I couldn't verify how it is, but seeing it come out of the kitchen it looks pretty good. This place is tiny so it can get loud but on the bright side it's open until 2am. Not super kid friendly.

Yay, I love IKEA!  It's always busy, but when you head over there you kind of have to plan to make a day of it.  I've always experienced great service from the employees and love everything I've purchased from there.  The only down side is I have to drive from Tucson...but it's worth it.

Oh, good old Dos Gringos.  I make it a point to hit up this place whenever I'm in Tempe.  The food is cheap, delicious, and there's an excellent patio that is awesome to sit on year-round.  The service can slack a bit when they're busy, but the wait staff seem to always make up for it.  The salsa is delicious, not too spicy, and extremely flavorful.  I've never had a complaint about their food and the drinks are on-point.  The outdoor patio is also dog friendly, which is really awesome.  And there are huge Jenga pieces and a bag toss game which is popular with the kids I've seen there.  I honestly don't know why this place only has three stars...give them a try.

Meh. Came here for a tire patch due to running over a screw. Tire guy couldn't find the key to my rims. I ended up taking my car to the dealership and the key to the rims was in the glovebox the entire time. Annoying.

I come out of my way to go to this Starbucks. I've tried the location on Agua Fria and the location at Bell and 7th, but they all pale in comparison to this location! The employees are always friendly and kind and the wait never is long.

I wanted to love St. Francis. Came for brunch today, waited for seating the approximate quoted time and were eventually seated in the mezzanine. We ordered drinks and then food within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the chile burger medium. It came back severely well done. The waitress avoided our table for about 15 minutes before I got the opportunity to send it back. Second burger came out equally as charred as the first. She didn't even check to make sure the food was right the second to around. I was starving and ate half of the burger before she came back to check and offered to take it off my bill if I wasn't going to finish it. What?! What kind of waiter barters over a half eaten meal. My friend enjoyed their meal but mine was a disaster. She did take the burger off the check but due to the horrible service I won't be returning.

So, previously I had a bad review.  I'll be honest...my experience was crappy.  But, St. Francis sent me a gift card for a second go-around and I have to say my experience was MUCH better.  Our waitress was great, attentive, and super friendly...five stars for the service.  I ordered the meat flat bread, my companion ordered the chile burger.  The flatbread I wouldn't get again, mainly because it was really greasy and a little on the unhealthy side for me.  The burger my friend got was cooked PERFECTLY (this was the issue last time).  The wine (Albarino) was DELISH and my friend's Dark and Stormy was on point.  I would come back to this place definitely during happy hour and I'd like to try dinner as well.  I'd make it a point to sit at the bar or the ground floor and avoid the mezzanine as that is where I think the service lacks the attentiveness needed.  Thanks, St. Francis.  I'll be back. :)

This is the largest and nicest WFM in the Phoenix metro area. Giant produce and meat selection, huge hot bar, and even an on-site restaurant. Employees are friendly and the place is always spotless. I go out of my way to grocery shop here.

I love Paradise! The salads and sammies are delicious and you get a delicious cookie with your order. The line gets long during the lunch rush but they clear it relatively quickly.

This location is right by my house. I find that the employees who work here are seriously the most pleasant Starbucks baristas EVER! And the drive thru line is fast unlike another location that I usually frequent.

I don't know why I've been holding off for so long on writing a review for this little piece of Heaven. It all started with their 5.00 vino before 5pm deal errday, yes errday, that drew me in. The bruschetta is fantastic, the wine selection is plenty, and I've never had anything here that I haven't at the very minimum liked. On Mondays and Tuesdays you can do a board of bruschetta and a bottle (yep, bottle) of wine for 20.00. You can find me and my bestie here every Monday unless someone died or T. Swift is in town. We've been known to even come back-to-back, it's that good. The patio ambiance is amazing with soft music and twinkly lights. I've never had back service here, in fact they will offer you a bottle of wine while you wait for your table. Yes, as the other reviews have stated the parking can be tough to find especially during the week, but there's a huge lot across the street that is owned by Upward Projects (parent company) so usually you can snag a spot. Beware, the wait does get long on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the amazing wine deal, but it's well worth it.

Omg. Everything here is amazing but my most favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake ice cream. It's to die for. You can't really go wrong with any flavor as they rotate seasonally. Cute seating area out back and conveniently next to all of Upward Projects other amazing restaurants.

No online ordering for this location which is why I take away a star. Called in my order and the hostess was extremely pleasant. I picked up my order and it was ready, food was excellent, no complaints. I would like to come back for a sit down meal as the wine selection looked good.

My boyfriend and I just purchased a new home and were in the market for a used pool table.  I contacted Daniel on Tuesday (7/5) to see when he could move a potential pool table purchase and how much it would cost.  He said he could move it same-day if needed.  I hadn't viewed the table yet to make the commitment to purchase it, so I told him we would give him a call when we found one.  My boyfriend went to view the pool table and we were skeptical on the quality of the brand we hadn't heard of before, but Daniel was amazingly helpful.  He was responsive via text to any questions we had and gave us advice as for what to look for during a used pool table purchase.  I feel he went above and beyond for us as his potential customer, offering his time and expertise, when we hadn't even pulled the trigger yet on a purchase.  Fast forward to today (7/9); my boyfriend spoke to Daniel last night and he was available to meet today at the seller's home all the way out in Goodyear at noon (short notice).  Originally he had quoted us a price of $245 for the move from Goodyear to Glendale, but we weren't aware the pool table was kept on the 2nd floor.  There was a price jump of about $50.00 to $295, but Daniel agreed to meet us halfway at $280.  The table was delivered to my home within an hour and a half of him starting disassembly, and the table was put together perfectly;  nothing was damaged whatsoever.  He took the time to educate me on how to care for the pool table, gave me his professional recommendation on where to position it, and suggestions on future care. At no point did I feel pressured to replace bumpers or felt, and he actually stressed to me what good of shape the bumpers were in and how nice the upgraded felt was.  Daniel and his partner were the most professional and respectful guys I have ever had in my home for any type of service.  They were courteous, friendly, and fast.  Due to the great job they did, the level of customer service provided, and their immediate availability, even though he met us halfway on the price for the job, I still felt what they did was worth every penny of the $295.00 actual price, and had no problem coming up from the $280.00 he agreed to meet us in the middle on.  I will definitely be using Daniel again in the future when we find a rug to go under the pool table and for any moves we may have in the future.

I ordered some lunch for my boyfriend via the EatStreet app.  He works super early mornings (4am) so his "lunch time" was still breakfast time for most people.  That being said, it was tough finding some lunch style food that early in the morning.  I pulled up the app, put in his work address, and found that Vermont Sandwich Co. delivered to his work and also had a lunch menu available that early in the morning.  I ordered him the full Long Trail sandwich, white chocolate orange cookie, and a Coke.  The order was placed at approximately 8:40AM and he had it a little after 9AM.  He said the sandwich was amazing and the delivery service was impeccable.  Although I don't live anywhere near this location, next time I am in Scottsdale I will swing by and try it for myself.  Great service!  Thank you!

I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a bar. I had four drinks in two hours along with dinner and the waitress cut me off. I was no where closed to being even buzzed. Was really offensive. Wouldn't come back unless I sat at the bar directly.

Wasn't bad. I would call it a high end Quiznos. Nothing to write home about. Employees are high school kids and aren't taking customer service to the next level by any means.

Easy online booking. A+ for convenience.  Clean and inviting interior.  Rooms are CLEAN. Employees are pleasant.  Designated parking.   I went in for a brow and Brazilian. I'm happy with both, Julie was adorable and we chatted about dogs and work and this and that while she was waxing my lady bits. Soft wax which I wasn't a huge fan of personally. I've always had hard wax for Brazilians in the past and the strip waxing style left my skin super sore and tender.  I have sensitive skin as is so this might be a deal breaker for me. I'll definitely come back for waxing everything else that's for sure.   If you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area I highly recommend.

I called Shedding Clean yesterday to schedule a grooming appointment for my 7mo Miniature Schnauzer.  They were able to get me in same day, but I opted for an appointment the following morning.  In under an hour they transformed my little hot mess into a gorgeous fluff ball.  Her ears are perfectly clean, sanitary area and face trimmed, nails clipped, and brushed out.  She looks awesome.  I highly recommend Shedding Clean.  They do an incredible job, have quick availability, prices are extremely reasonable (less than Petsmart!), and who doesn't love shopping local.
