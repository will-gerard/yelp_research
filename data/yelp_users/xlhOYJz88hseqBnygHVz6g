I go to Majerle's when I have an event downtown or waiting for a concert to start at US Airways. The martini selection is great! The cucumber martini is so refreshing. It's not on the menu, but if you ask, they will make it for you. They also have daily drink specials. Last time I went, it was $4 long islands. What a deal!   The best appetizer is the buffalo shrimp. The shrimp are butterflied, slightly breaded and fried. The crunch on the shrimp is amazing. And then they are coated with just the right amount of buffalo sauce. The only downside is that you only get about 6 to an order. The loaded potato skins are very good also.

I stopped in here today for lunch since I was in the area. The service was friendly and nice. I ordered the carne asada tacos. First I got chips and went to the salsa bar. The chips were noticeably stale, but the salsa was good. The carne asada tacos were gross. The meat tasted spoiled, the texture was weird and it was greasy. I was very hungry but could only stomach two bites. The beans were runny and tasted bad. I will not be back here again.

I was meeting a friend for lunch today at Oregano's. We got there promptly at 11 and got a parking spot and tablemmediately. We ordered calamari as a starter. This was the absolute worst calamari that I ever tasted! It didn't even look like calamari. It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood, but this tasted like bad fish, plus it was way over coated and salty. We sent it back and ordered fried ravioli. When it arrived, it too, was way over salted and tasted stale. We ate a few but didn't send it back. Next came our pizza. We ordered the lunch slices. The portion was a good size, but the pizza was very mediocre and the crust had the same stale flavor as the ravioli. Although the service was good, the food was very bad and I would not recommend Oregano's to anyone.

When I am in the area, I like to frequent this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I always try to go early or late, but never right at noon. This location is nestled between plenty of office buildings and if you go right at noon, there will surely be a wait.   Today I got the same great food and service! After glancing at the novel-sized menu and wrestling in my mind what to have... I had my usual: the shrimp and bacon club sandwich. I always order mine without the middle slice of bread. There are few reasons why I do this: 1. I can't fit the double decker sandwich in my mouth 2. it makes the sandwich more packed full of shrimp and bacon! 3. Less calories - which I guess makes up for the bacon and fries I had! All in all the sandwich was delish! They have a new nifty metal fry holder that kept my fries hot, too!

My bichon tore his ACL and I was distraught. I had this happen 2 years ago with another dog and I got the surgery done at a different place. I called the different place for a quote and their fees nearly doubled from 2 years ago! I found Arrow on Yelp, I called and the quote was very reasonable, but I also wanted the best quality for my fur baby. We had an appointment with Dr. Whilms and I felt very comfortable and confident that he was able to help my dog. He completed the surgery and I picked up my dog the same day. My dog was able to walk on his leg within a week and healed quickly! Actually, my dog healed much better than my previous dog that I took elsewhere 2 years ago. The staff is extremely nice, Dr. Whilms is professional and was great with my dog. I recommend anyone needing a vet or animal surgery to go here!

The stereo i wanted wasnt in stock. They ordered my stereo and then they called and said  it came in but someone sold it, then it was ordered again and lost. I called and left a message twice for a guy I spoke to and was never called back.  They made it very hard for me to spend my money. I finally gave up and went elsewhere. For the amount of money I was going to spend, they treated me like crap.

I know the service is lousy, but I come here because I like the food. HOWEVER, today the service was exceptionally terrible. We went in at 3:30 in the afternoon, it wasn't busy at all. Another table sat down at about the same time. We ordered, the other table ordered. The other table got their food and we waited and waited and waited.... We heard two waitresses bicker and argue at each other about clearing the tables, which was entertaining because I thought their might be a full on cat fight.... We waited and waited and we ran out of bread and no one asked us if we wanted more.....AN HOUR later, I asked about our food. Finally it came out ...... No apologies, no discount, ..... Never again!!!! Don't go here for good service!!!!!!

My husband and I went there for lunch today. Although, we were the first ones there, the service was horrible. The root beer that I got had no carbonation, so I ordered an iced tea which was left empty for what seemed to be an eternity before I got refill. I ordered my burger medium rare and got well done, plus the hamburger was very dry and tasted like saw dust. the clam strip appetizer was a very small amount of clam strips plus they were coated in a heavy batter that tasted like flour. It should be Red Robin..YUK, not yum

If you're looking for Authentic Mexican, this is not your place. But if you're looking for great Mexican-inspired food, this is you're place. Although, a chain, I would consider Abuelos one step up from On The Border, Chevy's, Macayo's or any other Tex Mex chain. The atmosphere and interior alone are more sophisicated. The salsa chips are very addicting. The salsa has a smooth smoky flavor. Also, the enchaladas and steak combo makes a great meal. I always ask for no seasoning or light seasoning on the steak because it's a little spicy. The enchaladas are flawless. And you must try the Papas con Chile! These are mash potatoes kicked up with cheese and peppers.

I finally tried Pinos, it's right next to my office and looked a little run down from the outside, but I'm glad I tried this place! I'm from the east coast and I have always searched for good east cost tasting pizza. It's all about the crust and Pinos crust is thin, chewy and charred. It's wonderful! And the Marianna is to die for. So far, I have tried their pizza and their calzones, both excellent. However if you get pepperoni and sausage, it's a little greasy, but it's pepperoni and sausage, so what do you expect. Thanks, Pinos for giving me a reason to go into the office :)

One word: sugar-coma (ok two words technically.) I got a dozen donuts for work, well a few for me too ;) the donuts were fresh and delicious. I also got my favorite Thai tea with boba and unfortunately it was disgustingly sweet. It tasted like sweetened condensed milk was added. I like it a little sweet, but it was overload. Next time I want to try their more savory items. I'll be back!

I can't believe Dr. Wainwright hasn't been reported for malpractice (or whatever happens to a dentist) This happened to me a few years ago, but is still traumatic, so I decided to warn everyone!!!  Dr. Wainwright told me I had 6 cavities on my first visit!! I was shocked since I only had 1 cavity in my life. Plus while doing the routine cleaning, he did some sort of drilling on my tooth and I have a small hole in my tooth.... I was scared to go back and tried 2 other dentists a year after. To my relief, the new dentists said I had no cavities! Just to make sure, I got another opinions and sure enough I had no cavities. Do NOT go to this dentist! Google him and see more reviews! http://www.ratemds.com/doctor-ratings/27792/Dr-Clayton-Wainwright-PEORIA-AZ.html

Great food! My favorites are sizzling rice soup (great when you're sick), poopoo platter, cashew chicken, house lo mein and house fried rice. The staff is very friendly and if you call to pick it up, it usually  takes 10 minutes. You can also find coupons for free lettuce wraps or crab puffs in the mailer ads.

Immediately when you walk in, the wonderful smells hit you in the face and even if you're not hungry, you want something.... Something sweet! This place is beyond dangerous if you're on a diet!  I'm like a kid in  a candy store every time I go there. Mostly everything is ala cart and inexpensive. I always want to try everything! So far, I highly recommend the cannolis, eclairs, carrot cake cupcakes, ordering cakes for special occasions and the cheese Danishes! Yum! You won't be disappointed!

CONS: the crowd - it can get really busy so I try to go right at 11 on Saturdays, but never on a Friday! The parking can also be a b!tch. The seating is cozy and tight, so if you're not ready to make friends with your neighbor this place is not for you.  PROS: GREAT food! My favorites include the Delux burger( but don';t let the bacon in the description fool you...its just a miniscule amount, if you want bacon on your burger order it extra), sweet potato fries (the best!), the homemade root bear, the shakes, the chinese chicken salad and the beet salad.

A group of 8 of us walked into Dave and Busters tonight for dinner and a little game play. I was happy to see that the dining room wasn't crowded with only one couple at a booth. We were greeted by an employee and in a less than charming voice she said, "it's open seating." We proceeded to enter the dining room and there was no visible seating for groups larger than 4, so we started to move and pull tables together while the staff did nothing to help. After all, they must have been very busy with that one table full of two people!   The waitress came around and took our drink orders. I was thrilled  to have learned that happy hour was until 7:30. I ordered a half priced very berry mojito. The drinks came, I didn't quite care for my drink, it was very very sweet. Almost like drinking koolaid. I was still in the drinking mood and was up for trying another half priced drink before happy hour was over, but our drink glasses sat empty for a long time with no waitress in sight. Our waitress finally returns from the abyss, asks two people at our table if they would like refills, and ignores the remaining 6 people. Really?! I was thinking this surely must be one of those 'What Would You Do?" shows, but unfortunately it wasn't and the lack luster service went on throughout the meal.   Speaking of our meal. We waited for what seemed to be an eternity for our food to arrive and when it did only half of us received our meals. The waitress got lost once again in the abyss during this time and drink glasses remained empty. Too bad because there would have been a lot more alcohol consumption.  I tried to be gracious and wait till my buddies got their food, but  I was starving by this point and dug in.    I got the jack daniels chicken/power card combo. I asked to have the green beans, but was informed that they no longer served the green beans. Last time I visited, I had the green beans and they were well seasoned with just the right amount of crunch, tonight I was served a few different pitiful looking pieces of broccoli and carrots. The chicken was two paper thin pieces. I'm not exaggerating, paper thin! The mash potatoes were like wall paper paste! And they messed up two of the steak orders at the table. They were served very well done when the order was for medium rare. Also, I overheard  my friend comment that his steak tasted like saw dust. There were various mistakes with the other orders as well...wrong sides, etc.   After the meal, we went to play the games. The games were fun and I thought of it as Dave and Buster's very clever way to have me forget about the gawd awful service and food I just endured. But all in all it wasn't fun enough to make me forget to post on yelp and warn my fellow yelpers! Eat somewhere else and visit here to  play the games after! You have been warned!

well, sometimes "little hole in the wall" places are very good and tend to surprise you... but not this place... The service was good and friendly, but the food was horrible. The orange juice tasted very bad, the gravy on the biscuits tasted like flour and water (paper mache) the bacon and mushroon omlet had a bad after taste... skip this place and go to ihop.

Thanks for making my birthday dinner horrible! First, I would like to say that our waitress was courteous and very nice, but the food tonight was inedible! My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner, it was my favorite place and we have been coming here for 8 years. I ordered the lobster bisque and he ordered the clam chowder. Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better.... And Pappadeaux, no need to respond to my review because no apology is going to be good enough to have me dine in your establishment again.

I love the pho here and just don't understand the bad reviews. I used to get the chicken pho, but yes it lacked a little flavor, so if you're a meat eater, don't skimp and get the pho with tender beef. The broth is so rich and delicious and veggies so fresh. I also recommend banh xeo (#5 on the appetizers)

I love this PF Changs. I've always liked the food, but the customer service is fantastic! I recently ordered  to-go order and they even mixed up some of their special sauce. they were very courteous and placed the bag in my car for me. I've been blown away at their customer service every time I visit!

Yummy comfort food at reasonable prices. My favorites are the daily soups, hamburgers and buffalo chicken dip! The only cons would be the parking is limited, but it s right off a light rail stop and the place is sort of small and can be crowded.

Most of the sushi is good, but today I was very disappointed with the service and the food. Our waitress was very inattentive, but I left that slip because it was somewhat busy and she seemed to be the only one working the tables.   But what really got me was that our lobster roll came out covered in massive amounts of mayo. I took a bite and my hubby took a bite and literally felt sick from the amount of mayo. The waitress never came back to ask us how our meal was and when she came back to clear the table she asked if we wanted a box. I explained that the roll was not edible, she said "yeah it does look like a lot of mayo." and took it away. She did not ask to replace it or discount our bill. When the bill came, we were charged for the roll. I decided to take that out of her tip.  Bottom line, its a hit and miss with the service and the food.

Hubby and I went here for lunch today. During lunch, the main dining room is usually closed and the bar area is open. I was a little discouraged at first, because of seating, but there were plenty of booths, tables and the bar to sit. We ordered some wings and a burger. The waitress was very attentive, the wings came out fast. The wings were very good. I recommend the strawberry hot wings. And if you just want to try a few wings, they sell them individually! The burger was also cooked perfectly. My hubby and I split the burger and a dozen wings. They even split the burger and divided it on two plates. I would highly recommend this place for lunch!

Meh. I've experienced better is about right with this place. Arrowhead Grill, your food was good, but when I'm shelling out $200 for dinner for two, I expect top notch service and ambience. We tried this place for the first time last night. We usually go to flemmings, but wanted to try something different. The place was loud and  there was a crying baby. The large dried red leaves that decorated the walls were very gaudy and the lighting was way too bright. I could have looked past all of this if our service was better. Our waitress while she seemed to be nice, was odd. She said "I can offer you the calamari or butter cake" we had no idea what that meant.  We thought she recommended those items, but later found out we got one free for being 1st timers. Which was generous I guess. Other than that, they were out of pear martinis, they did not refill drinks. I wanted a glass of wine with my steak and the wine came after I was done with my steak. The bus boys seem to be all high school age and when one cleared our bread plates, the butter knife fell to our table and the butter splattered on the table and my dress. No one cleaned up the table for us. However, the steaks were good, but I can get good steaks and much better service at Flemmings or Mastros.....

Grimaldi's, I love your food, but your customer service is horrible, therefore I am forced to rate you as a 1. Let's take last night as an example. I went to pick up my large pizza and a salad. I saw my pizza come out, I saw two guys opening the box,  looking at the pizza and discussing something. One guys comes over to me, quickly opens the lid and says "isthisok?" (yup all in one word.) I said "uhh yeah, I guess so"... "but wait it looks a little small to be a large." He says - oh yeah it's between a medium and a large, but we will give you your salad for free. So, if I would have said "yes, it looks fine," they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what I paid for?! Plus now I have a pizza that will not fill up my family? When I ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says "well its gonna take 20-25 minutes." So, I leave... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad... and don't expect anyone to hold the door for you either... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk.  Ps- this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and I must say even Domino's and Pizza Hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings!

Valentine's Day nightmare! The service was horrible. Waitress never checked in on us, our entree came before salads. My flemmings salad came out warm, soggy and wilted. After telling the manager, he said we would be comped for entrees, which we were not. And then we got dessert to go and guess what? Just got home and the dessert order was wrong! $279 spent at the wrong restaurant!!

Sacks is my ultimate favorite sandwich shop, but since it was noon on Friday and I guarantee no parking at Sacks,I decided to give Ladybug a try. I got half chicken salad sandwich, potato salad and small tea. I was first surprised at how small the sandwich was for the price I paid. The chicken salad had way too much mayo. The potato salad tasted like it came from a tub and I actually seen the cookies in a store bought box and the soup from a box as well! It would be nice to see bigger sandwiches and homemade items.

The last few times I went here, the customer service has been TERRIBLE! Today I went here for lunch with my husband. I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup with extra avocados and the snack ahi bowl. He orders a bowl of clam chowder and pizza. I get my soup with no spoon and no extra avacado, he gets his pizza with a cup of chicken soup. We correct them and tell them my hubby had a bowl of clam chowder, they come back with a bowl of chicken tortilla----- we correct them again. Well, three times a charm because they finally got it right. Then they give me the ahi tuna roll instead of the bowl. I sent it back an finally got the bowl, it had no dressing and tasted nasty, but I didn't have the time or energy to send another thing back. At least the chicken tortilla soup is always good, even without extra avocado!

The food is great and the place is local! I had the fried shrimp meal with a side of hush puppies. The hush puppies were  seasoned nicely and came with a good dipping sauce. The shrimp were huge and fried perfectly. My hubby got the combo platter. The platter could easily feed two people. I tasted the cod, chicken and clams, they were all great! We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu! :)

I walked in and thought they forgot to put the lid on a blender full of smurfs... BLUE... EVERYWHERE.....   After I got past the atrocious decor, I ordered Wings mild, a appletini, kobe Burger and Sweet potato fries.   The wings - they only had mild and hot when it came to "buffalo" flavors. I ordered mild, but preferred a little more kick. They were really good and juicy.   The martini - ick ick ick too much crown royal.... wouldn't think I would complain about too much alcohol in my drink. I told the waitress and she didn't do anything. didn't offer to replace it or take it off my bill.  The Kobe burger - hmmmm I ordered medium rare and it came out "gray." It tasted ok, but something just wasn't right with the meat. and I was disappointed that it was over cooked.   The sweet potato fries- excellent, but you get a very small amount as a side to you burger.   I would possibly go back and try a different burger.

All I can say is YUMMY! Yesterday I went to lunch with a friend at Thai E-San. I got the Pad Thai noodle lunch special. All the lunch specials come with a soup of the day and egg roll for a great price. The soup had tofu and cabbage. I'm not a big fan of tofu, but the flavor was really good! It was sweet, sour and spicey and I didn't mind the tofu at all! I got the pad thai noodles "medium" spicey.... wooohooo, the medium spicey cleared my sinuses! It was on the little spicey side for me, but flavorful enough for me to keep taking another bite! The meal ended with a few slices of watermelon, which was perfect to cool my lips and mouth with. I can't wait to go try another dish. The food, service and value will make me come back!

They have great sweet potato fries (not as good as delux though.) I usually get the ahi tuna ceasar salad. Its great, but order the dressing on the side- it's always over dressed. The food is good, but I think just a little over priced.

My dear Hula's, What happened today? Maybe it was the lunch rush, but that's no excuse. Our ice tea and water tasted very weird and slightly sweetened. If you're trying out something new, it's not a good idea. our food, which consisted of a lunch salad, sandwich and sweet potato fries took forever. The fries were cold, the ahi tuna very very over cooked and hardly any pink. Please get better soon. I will probably be back, but I will make sure it's not during lunch and that I order something different.

Arrowhead health used to be better years ago. I recently  tried to make an appointment with my doctor and was told she only comes in on special occasions. So I made an appointment with a PA. I immediately noticed that Arrowhead health had turned into the one stop shop Walmart of healthcare. However, just like Walmart, quality is compromised. I told the PA I would feel reassured if she ran certain tests. That went in one ear and out the other. I was told if I wanted any blood work, I would need to make another appointment for a physical, which had nothing to do with why I was at the appointment. Same thing happened to my husband, the PA didn't listen to him or answer questions.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this place out. I was surprised that the place was so small, but cozy. I went for lunch, but can see parking could be an issue on busy nights.   The food: For lunch, my friend and I split the whole fried chicken dinner which included a salad and a side. The waitress let us order 2 sides instead of the salad- great idea! We both ordered the home cut fries. Our chicken came out piping hot. I took a bite and immediately my mind went back to my childhood. THE FRIED CHICKEN IS JUST LIKE MY GRANDMA'S ..... YUMMY! and the fries were delicious as well. They were seasoned just right. I will be sure to return and try some of the other foods on the menu...they all looked so good!  PS- the appetizers weren't on the menu, but listed on a laiminated sheet tucked into the condiment holder!

I went to Chik a rib for lunch today and it was great! I had chicken and waffles, plus mac n cheese and some ribs. The fried chick was crispy on the outside and very juicy meat- it was great! The waffle was fluffy and buttery. It was the best waffle I ever had. The ribs were so tender that they fell off the bone and the mac and cheese was very velvetty and good. I would recommend this place to anyone! they also had desserts that looked good, but I was too full to try any of them!

I decided to give Bliss/reBar a second chance. On my first visit, I ordered the Bliss burger and found the amount of cheese combined with the heaviness of the bun, really over powered the burger itself. So last night, I met a friend for dinner. I started out with a glass of their malbec. I was very impressed with the quality and smoothness of the malbec! We got some Parmesan garlic fries to share. They were just ok. I thought it was strange that they were served with marinara sauce. Next, I ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon and chicken. It came out piping hot and oozing with cheese. Normally I don't complain about the amount of cheese, but just like the burger I had, both dishes had way too much cheese in comparison the other ingredients. I did however enjoyed the slight spicy kick that the dish had.   I guess I would come here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

I needed a mic system for a non profit event, so I went to Sonoran. The customer service was absolutely wonderful! The office manager gave me detailed directions to their office and even emailed me a picture of the front of the building! I have to admit, I was a little intimidated about working the equipment since I'm not too techie. When I picked  up the system, their staff showed me how to easily work the system and when I got to the event, everything ran smoothly! Thanks, Sonoran for helping to make our event a success!

I heard that Hamburger Haven was under new management so I decided to give it a try with my co-worker. The first thing I noticed was the painted seascape was gone and instead was a nicely painted restaurant. The friendly guy behind the counter told me they are in the process of doing some remodeling and the booths and menu would be next. Both my co-worker and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (however, unlike the name, there are many other sandwich and salad choices).  We both made it a combo with fries. The guy told me that they are using the technique of smashing the burgers on the grill to sear in the juices.  Shortly later, our orders came out hot and delicious! The burger was juicy and had great flavor. I ordered mine with caramelized onions- yummy! The fries were good, too, but the star of the mean was the burger! It was a great value, too! I will definitely be back soon!

My husband and I go here for pho when we are in the area and its well worth the trip. The pho is always delicious and boith is so flavorful! We have never got any other entree other than pho, but tempted after seeing the pictures on yelp. For drinks, try the coconut drink or lemon soda, both very good! Be careful, it's not free refills, but I usually drink about two. For appetizers, the shrimp eggs rolls and spring rolls are very good choices.

My experience at this bikram yoga has always been great! Honestly, I'm not perfect at every pose, I sit out on some and I'm usually heavier than most people in the class. HOWEVER, the instructors are very nice, encouraging and take extra time to help or talk to students after class. I never thought I would like "group exercise", but I feel very welcomed here and feel great after class. If you haven't tried bikram, this is the place to start!

YUMMY! My hubby and I tried this place tonight and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. This is not tex-mex, but it's authentic homemade Mexican food. I had the Baja chicken chimi with jalapeño cream cheese. The green sauce over the chimi was so delicious and the chimi was huge and stuffed with so much chicken!! The jalapeño cream cheese was so good with everything else. The salsa tasted great, too. My hubby had the "pick 3" meal and got a burrito, tostada and enchilada. He also thought his meal was outstanding. The portions were very huge and the prices were so reasonable. We will definitely be back again!

We went here today for lunch because we were craving the wings. We ordered a salad, pizza and a few different types of wings. We were told the wings would be up first, which we wanted. Well, we waited and waited and waited and finally our salad and pizza arrived, but no wings. We were told that they were short staffed and it would be a little longer for the wings... we ate the salad and pizza and waited and waited...meanwhile, the waitress filled our ice tea and spilled a big puddle on the table which she just left on the table....we were about ready to cancel our wing order and leave and finally they arrived. The food was good, but the customer service and wait time was horrible! I will think twice before I go here again.

I saw the yelp reviews and drive past JJs often. I decided to stop today for lunch for me and hubby. I got the 2 meat dinner for each of us. "JJ", I'm just assuming that's the guy's name.... Was very friendly and had me taste the meat. The ribs were so yummy, but the star was the brisket! I don't even eat brisket, but do now! it was sooo tender, juicy, smoky and good! The chicken is a thigh and leg and was very good, too. Each meal came with potato salad and beans. Those were very good, too. I highly recommend this bbq truck, in my opinion, it's better than the bbq sit down restaurants close by!

This review is mostly for the service. We went there for a late lunch. Our waiter took forever to take our order and get out drinks, the soup was luke warm to cold and our drinks weren't refilled. We told him about the soup and didn't get a new soup til almost the end of our meal. It also took forever to get our check. However, the sushi was delicious, but there are plenty of other food sushi places with much better service.

I don't normally review fast food places. Raising Cane's have been popping up around the valley and since I'm a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got "The Box" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The "canes sauce" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!

The found this gem last month and been here a few times since. The owner is very friendly and the first time we went, he let us taste a few things. The food has amazing flavors! The mofongo is a delicious blend of plantains, butter and garlic. The beans and rice are amazing,too! I highly recommend the empanandas, too. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

We went here for an early lunch today, but found they don't open til noon everyday. We walked around westgate and came back around and was surprised to see a line out the door. My advice would be to show up a little early and wait. We got seated right away. We ordered the corn fritters and Cajun calamari to start. We were told that the corn fritters were like hush puppies, which they were not. Although the fritters were not like hush puppies, they were still good. They were small marble sized fried balls filled with almost like a cream corn with whole corn. The calamari was very good. It came fried and with a dry Cajun seasoning on top. We then got the snow crab, hot and juicy medium and the shrimp butter garlic medium. The snow crab was delicious and hot and juicy medium was just right. The shrimp were good, but we both agreed that the hot and juicy would be better on the shrimp next time. The service was great and our drinks were always filled promptly. If you want fancy shmancy, go to Mastros, if you want good, home cooking, finger lickin seafood, go here, you even get a bib.

This is a very interesting place. The atmosphere is rocker, trendy, barbershop. I saw an ad about Floyd's, did some research  and found out they are a full service salon for men and women contrary to their name "barbershop." So I needed color, highlights and a cut badly and quickly. I called and got an appointment right away. They are a chain store and use all Paul Mitchell products. Not that it means anything to me, I just wanted a cute short cut and my grays covered. Although, I felt a little uncomfortable getting color and highlights in what appeared to be a barbershop, Alex did an awesome job with my color and cut! The highlights came out perfect and very pretty. The price surprised me, I paid a total of $117 for color, partial highlights and adding their hair cut special of $11. Without the special, it would have been over $125. I thought it was a little high since this place did not scream beauty salon. I would describe it as a huge step up from Great Clips, but the not as cozy or as nice as a salon.  The hair cuts are a great deal and I'm sure to go back for my trims.
