We were excited to find a place the served menudo AND posole.  The menu looked excellent and the aromas were wonderful.  The place was clean.  Chips and salsa were supposed to come with the meal but no, we didn't get that.  We asked for oregano, but never got that either.  When we asked again, they said someone will come by to our table.  No one ever did although two tables next two us were visited by waitstaff three times but never stopped once at ours.  The broth for both the menudo and posole were thin and lacked flavor.  We asked for a chile relleno on the side, but never received that.  Anyway, we were hungry, finished half and left.  Will not be back.

Everything we have eaten here has been delicious.  The owners are super nice and friendly.  The pastrami is like the kind you can get in L.A. and the burgers remind me of Spartan Burgers in H.P. - yum!  Delicious.  Burgers, pastrami, fries, onion rings, breakfast, -- all good stuff!

The one downtown has amazing customer service but I do not recommend shopping at the Goodyear location. Three workers were literally standing around the front door chatting and completely oblivious.

Yelpers, the manager I just talked to said she and all the managers do not care about what "yelpers" have to say. No, thanks. Read the reviews about poor service and decided to call an ask if there were any improvements made and "ros" the manager said she doesn't care about those reviews and of course she's aware of her staff. I asked about the wait and she said is about a two hour wait right now and at least 30 minutes to get food once you're seated.  Personally, I love Yelp and it has never let me down.  This manager's poor attitude was just one of the reasons we will not even make an attempt to visit this place. Thanks, Yelpers!! I care what you have to say :)

Best Pho on the west side. The broth has a very rich flavor. Right price. Good service. The rest of the menu is a reason for us to come back.

Tried this for the first time for lunch.  Very tasty!   About $17 for the H3 roll and a drink but the rolls are huge and I couldn't finish the whole thing.  If you're craving sushi someplace downtown, I recommend this place!

Although flavorful, the rye bread was soaked.  We were really looking forward to a "hot" pastrami but the meat was hardly lukewarm bordering on room temperature.  We have no problem spending $30 on two sandwiches on a drink if it was worth it but these were not...will not return.
