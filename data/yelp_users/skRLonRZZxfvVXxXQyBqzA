This is one of those places that deserved *ZERO STARS* if Yelp would allow it.  We asked if there was table service before 9 of us sat down in a large booth.  Big mistake!  The same waitress that told us to have a seat came over about 20 minutes later.  During that time, some of us went to the bar out of shear frustration.  Bigger mistake.  They came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks.  At that point we had been there for almost an hour and my alcohol dependency started to give me the shakes.  We finally got the drinks from the server and asked for our check so we could leave immediately.  Despite saying that we could pay however we'd like and she just needed a card to "hold", she insisted on swiping the one card for the whole bill.  The reason: "It's just too busy to bring you the check".  If that was a busy night, I would hate to see what that place looks like when it's slow.    The icing on the proverbial cake was the *BROKEN GLASS* I found in my cocktail.  The server was disinterested in my future digestive issues resulting from the shards of glass and lurked over the table as we signed the check.

I grew up going to this theater. All of the amenities are standard and seats are comfortable. However, I am 26 years old. I will concede that I have a young face but getting ID'd at the ticket booth for a rated R movie is mildly laughable. It went from laughable to annoying when a young teenage girl wanted to see my ID and ticket stub before allowing us to take our seats. Just so you know, we were seeing Youth in Revolt not Showgirls.

Probably the most amazing pasta dish I have ever had.  The toasted herd gnocchi with milk braised sweatbreads was perfect in so  many ways.  The gnocchi was slightly crisp on the outside with a perfectly rich and creamy sauce.  The sweatbreads were amazingly tender and the portion was just enough.  My girlfriend loved her freshly made white sangria with blueberries and strawberries.  Despite an extremely busy Valentines Day, our service was attentive and professional.  I have been to Boa many times but this is hard to beat.

Great coffee is hard enough to find amongst the national brands that spring up around central and north Scottsdale. These local hangouts with great coffee are typical around Phoenix. There are even a couple that have sprung up around old town (D'lish, etc..). Despite how busy they always are, the service is fast with a genuine kindness.  In other words, it didn't feel forced like the over zealous and obnoxious teenagers that you find at Coffee Bean and Starbucks.  We need more independently owned spots like this up north!!

We were only able to grab a high top in the bar for Happy Hour. The draft beer selection was pretty extensive and the HH prices were reasonable. we really enjoyed the smoked chicken flatbread and catfish tacos on the HH menu as well. The Chef popped out of the kitchen in his chefs coat and trademark bandanna so at least we know he is in the kitchen putting the final touches on everything before it hits the dinning room. The whole experience was classic McGrath circa Roaring Fork and P. Blue Ribbon (I thought it was good despite its short tenure). This one will last.

You can't really criticize BWW for the mediocre food served in paper boats and dressing packets for salads.  They are a national company that seems to be doing something right considering their success.  However, you'd think such success would translate to some kind of service standard.    I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place.  It was the ASU v. UofA football game and the place was overflowing.  According to our server, the shortage of bartenders justified our second round of drinks taking more than an hour. MORE THAN AN HOUR!!!  Unfortunately for him, the lack of bartenders could not be blamed for the food taking even longer.    At one point, after checking three times to see if a runner had brought our drinks, someone got up from the table to ask him if they were ever going to come.  His response, "You didn't order more drinks."  Let me say that again.  He checked back with us three times to see if we had gotten a round of drinks that, according to him, we never ordered.  Confused???  So were we.   If they keep this up, they won't last much longer than Six Shooters.
