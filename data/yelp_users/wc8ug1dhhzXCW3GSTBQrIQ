The food is ok not that great ; small burritos , too soggy the problem : beans and chili too much liquid; burrito broke in half.    The wait is 30 for a burrito, ; this place is definitely not my fav.  Its seems to me  they make $$ $$  but the place looks like third world country place.

GREAT HAPPY HOUR!  I would recommend and try the sea food pasta along with sauvignon blanc.  The pasta was delicious it had 4 large tender shrimps mix with lobster meat and tasty mussels .

They will never get my money near there.   They treat people like we are living on 1948 times.   I was dressed to impress had American Express and still they would not let us up to the pool area.  (we were minority soon to be change)   I never had experienced anything like it anywhere in my life.   So Never ((((((((THe Famous W Hotel)    They do not want my money , I will not give them my money.

The waiting is too long!! They should expand their patio , offer a complementary drink if you wait is more then an hour ! Who waits an hour to go out to eat! This is the reason i dont come here. She wanted to come here!

Pizza is delicious and fresh ! Service i was not to satisfied, i been there couple of times around 9pm and the server/bartender seems like he always has a hotdate waiting for him . Always  when we get there he tries to rush us to order and points out ( the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes. We work in the industry and we never tall our customers hurry up order eat and leave i have to go home .
