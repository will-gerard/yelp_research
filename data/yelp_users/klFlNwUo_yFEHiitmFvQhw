This is my first time here. I don't know about other dishes but the rice plate I had was pretty good. The fish sauce mix was perfect, the grilled pork chop was cooked to perfection, the over easy egg was done well. I tried the pho and it was a typical tasting pho, nothing to rave about. I guess comparing this place to Pho Thuan Kieu at Mekong Plaza, for the prize and the amount of side dishes that they give you here, Pho Thuan Kieu gives you more for your dollar. I think I would stop by here if I was ever in the Ahwatukee area to try other dishes.   Ambience: A Service: A Price: B Food: A

This restaurant is located by My sister's Closet in North Scottsdale. This is the typical Brazilian steakhouse, except there's no grilled pineapple! I was greatly disappointed. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the display of circling skewered meat. My top favorites are the house special, the pork sausage and the garlic sirloin. Other than the parade of delicious meat, there is also the salad bar. Even though I enjoyed the different cuts of meat, after I've stuffed myself, I can't recall what I've ingested. If you're ready to be stuffed and experience food amnesia, this is the place to go.

I've been here a few times. The food is tasty and spicy comparable to Swadee Thai, or even better. I've ordered Pad Thai, catfish with chili sauce and duck in curry (Gung ped Yang. All three dishes were delicious. I'm pretty picky with my thai food and I think this place does a great job with them. Service is great. They gave us a complimentary dessert because we had to wait a little longer for a dish. A typical Friday night expect about 15-20 minutes wait. The place is very cozy with cute decor. Prices are decent. I will make this my frequent dinning place when I'm craving some spicy Thai food!

This place really lacks the organization from the wait staff (waitress and kitchen staff). Two of the staff were running around, pretty clueless. They seem so overwhelmed. We didn't get water until 30 min. later, no plates and the kitchen staff allegedly lost our order slip. The restaurant is part conveyor belt and the other half is a sit down restaurant. The conveyor belt is limited in sushi dishes, pretty boring for a conveyor belt restaurant. The sushi was ok. The wait staff was the main issue for me. I will not come back to this restaurant.
