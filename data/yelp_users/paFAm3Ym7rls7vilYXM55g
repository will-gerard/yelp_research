Damn good pizza! A little spendy (hence why I didnt give them 5 stars) for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food.

Juan's is a Phoenix staple in my opinion. I moved here from the Northwest about 3 years ago and I've tried just about every Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix downtown area. Juan's is defiantly up there with the best of them, the burritos are awesome and filling, the carne asada is amazing and the tacos are WHOA! I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for a large, Delicious meal not looking to spend a lot of money (did I mention they were cheap?!?)

If I could describe Stackers in one word it would be "classic". It reminds me of that old show Cheers because literally everyone knows everyones name.   The beers cheap, the foods decent enough (which means its awesome when your slightly wasted) and the environments relaxed.... what else could you ask for in a bar??  Oh and yea, those 50 cent wings are some of the best in Phoenix,  try them!

This mall blows... wait is it even a mall?? First off it's extreamly small, about 20 shops with those weird annoying little kiosks in the middle. Secondly almost all the shops in this lame mall are slightly hood/ghetto. I can count at least 3 stores in there that sell those weird baggy shirts with logos on them, gold chains and ecko pants.. Yea, those kind of stores...Third, it smells. Yes, it smells in there.. I'm not really sure what the smell is but its not a very good one.. There are a few decent things about this mall though which happen to be the food, theres a costco hot dog stand which has hot dogs and a soda for like a buck fifty, cant go wrong there.. Theres also a radioshack, gamestop, jcpenny and a Harkins theater.. but thats about it when it comes to good things about this mall.. AVOID THE WALMART at all costs! You'll wait in line for over an hour, its CRAZY!

So I went to Lola a few days ago thinking the local coffee shop would be great considering all the people in there. BOOOOY was I wrong. All those "people" in the shop were just pretentious little hipster kids and the staff (one confused looking girl) didn't know ANYTHING about coffee. She was stuck up, non interested and just plain rude. I ordered a large vanilla late and received a medium regular late, no vanilla. It wasn't a friendly place, I felt unwelcome there and I'll NEVER go back or recommend that place. If your looking for a good coffee shop downtown hit up JOBOT, the people are friendly and the drinks are a million times better.

Nothing to write home about, the chicken seems microwaved and the appetizers are meh. I've been there a few times, I live in the area and its really hard to find good Chinese food. If your looking for a quick oriental fix I'd say go for it.. otherwise look elsewhere.
