Go here for the food, but most importantly, the mango sticky rice dessert. HEAVEN.  I work around the corner so come here once a month or so. The owner is a very sweet lady and the servers remember us which is heartwarming.   I enjoy their pad thai quite a bit and have tried other dishes as well. They're soups are fantastic and so is their iced tea!

I love, love, love this place. Does parking suck? Yes. Do they get busy at LUNCH hour? Duh. Is it small? Yes. Is it fun, locally owned with fresh ingredients and nice people that run the place? Yes, Yes, Yes and Yes.   So to me, it's worth 5 stars and $7.82 for a wrap and side....   I see complaints that ppl think it's expensive, me thinks not. If you go to any other lunch time "quick bite" place you'll pay about the same amount (or more), unless you're talking about a franchise fast food spot.   This place is right around the corner from where I work so I like to zip over here when I've forgot lunch or too lazy to make it. I almost always get the Turk 182 b/c I love artichokes and the Muenster cheese. I decided to branch out and tried the Sherry A'More. YUM! I don't think the food is bland, and I like flavor. I don't think they all taste the same either....the garlic rice in some of the wraps is great, and I normally don't like rice in wraps.   Every time I go here the people are ALWAYS nice, even when getting eye rolls, sighs and rude comments from customers. Service is HUGE with me and goes a LONG LONG way so I can easily look past small inconveniences of parking and a small restaurant and the occasional mistake of the order taker...

My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.

La Grande Orange---La Confusing. When I walked in I felt totally disoriented trying to figure out where I was supposed to go. It was nice I met someone here who had been before. He showed me the ropes.   Ordered the San Danielle Sandwich - simple grilled type of sandwich. Nothing spectacular, but was satisfying for the most part. The outside, which was most likely sprayed with the butter crap was way toooooo salty for my tastes.  The people were pretty nice, a nice play to sit and have a conversation.  I guess that's all I have to say about it. Wish I had more passion for the place....

I think this place is great! I love that it's been there for years and years, locally owned with friendly staff. They're super easy-going and makes for a great lunch spot. Great spot for toddlers too :)  I like the Navajo taco--yum! Really, I think I'd like anything here. Oh, and they have wine magaritas----never head of before. The alcohol is not tequila, but, can you guess? Wine! It's definitely different but I likey. Would have had another but I was driving. boo.

My husband took me here for my bday this past w/e. We went with a few other people and had a great time...minus the drink crashing to the dance floor the drunk cousin-in-law let slip! Dancing, huge variety of people, everyone laidback. I would say definitely a couple place or just a place to kick it with your friends, not to pick up ladies/gents.  I would have liked to stay here longer but we didn't :(   It was great seeing the couples that knew how to dance! I will definitely be going back.

this place is misleading in what type of facility is. when you pull up there are 2 listings on the sign: mendy's place and children's emergency center. oh! they offer 2 types of care options....mendy's place for normal issues and children's emergency for....emergencies!! the listings point to same place so, ok, they must be housed in same area.    WRONG!!!! but....you don't know this until after your child is seen and they tell you the copay for an ER visit. they quote emtala as the reason for not telling you cost of services/co pay upon entry, even tho its clear your child is NOT suffering from an emergency situation. oh! and the receipt and paperwork you receive also does not reference an emergency facility....but it is. has been for 10 years, but if one's not been here before, how would one know?  the signs are misleading, they hide behind emtala so they can see you and thus process larger claim.   if you're looking for an urgent type facility, this is NOT it.

This facility is an urgent care, and looks like they do physical therapy as well. My review will be short as my hand is wrapped as i type!  After i cut my hand a good neighbor found this place that accepted my insurance coverage. She called, they said I could be in and out in an hour or so. Got there at about 4:45 pm, walked in, my mom started filling out paperwork and they took us back.  The staff was exceptional - friendly, understanding, helpful and just plain ol' nice. can't beat that, especially in the urgent care setting (I have a pretty negative stereotype of "those places"). The doctor was great, the medical assistant was great and we were out of there about 6:15.  I think it took longer than it could have from the banter -- dr. had wonderful beside manners.  Oh, and they weren't crazy about the copay either - and by crazy I mean making me fork over the payment as i'm trying to hold one hand with the other to prevent the gaping hole from bleeding (sorry queasy ppl). Actually, didn't even pay copay so I'm sure that will get taken care of with my insurance eob. My point is that they don't seem too worried about the money but more about taking care of patients.   Yes, i felt like a patient!

I've been itching to go to FEZ for a long time based on all the other wonderful reviews. I drive by FEZ nearly every day as I work just down the street.    Finally went with a buddy of mine and I got razzed more than I'd like for picking out a sub-par place! That is factoring in the food and the service. I'd probably give 2.5, 3 stars for the food. I'd give 1.5 stars for the service.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, although the service would have suggested otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was very pleasant and personable, but the time that went by before we got refills or that my dining companion's DIET COKE was fixed to a regular coke took too long. Me not being a soda drink couldn't care less about diet vs. regular but I know, I know, you soda drinkers need to have it exactly as you're taste buds know.   The food: I already had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus.  I must  say I was extremely impressed with the taste of the kisra....actually...I would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch, for sure. But I would get it to go. I wouldn't come back on a lazy Sunday afternoon b/c although I'm being lazy, I don't want the service lazy.  On to my friend's lunch...he got the All-American Burger. To me, this should have come on a sesame seed bun, what's more American other than apple pie,right?  Now I understand the Mediterranean flair that is FEZ, but it just didn't seem right to call it All-American when it's more like half-American....and his salt and pepper fries were not even warm-ish. And they tasted reheated. boo.  We both decided this would maybe have been a better time had if we were there in the evening. I think we'll give it one more try at night and see if we don't enjoy it a little more.  Maybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews, maybe we came at a bad time, maybe he ordered the wrong item. Maybe I'll give FEZ another shot....but I'm not in a hurry to do that right now.

This is a cute little place with great orange mojitos. It's nearby my work, offers happy hour drink specials (orange mojito the day I went) and appear to have a great light menu of apps, sandwiches, salads.  I met a friend here based on Yelp searching.   We tried the hummus duo - hummus with an olive tapenade. The best part is you're served PLENTY of pita so you aren't continually asking for more which is a pet peeve of mine that so many restaurants make you do.   We also got the anti-pasta plate which was pretty tasty.  The 2 apps was enough to fill both of us.  I only had 1 drink :( - i was being responsible - so we got out of there at $15/ person which i think is a steal to be full and satisfied with a delicious orange mojito - which appeared to be made with lotsa love.  Atmosphere - fun, enjoyable, friendly, light, like the colors, art. We got there about 4:30 and hardly anybody there. When we left at 6 more tables were filled and would expect it to continue through the evening. Music was good and not too loud which is another pet peeve.  Would definitely go back again. (enjoyable people, atmosphere and food and easy to have a conversation with company)  the orange mojito was YUMMY if i forgot to mention anything about it :)

I heart Ticoz! I've been here a few times and it never disappoints. The servers are great, the bartender is great. Eating in the bar/lounge area or the restaurant is equally nice.   I had a friend who held a small bday party in their separate room which was a nice little treat.   I think they're food is delish, love their sangria and mojitos and just the overall vibe. I'm always wanting to go back.

this is the first Thai place I've been to other than a Chinese restaurant that served Thai food. I really enjoyed eating here and would go back.  The waiter & waitress both were friendly, personable and attentive. I would enjoy going back and trying more on their huge menu. I went here awhile ago so can't remember for sure what i got, but it was good - good enough that i took leftovers home and ate them the next day or so.   Not sure if the place was that out of the ordinary (decor or type of food) for tourists or just some co-workers but this group was taking pictures of the food items pictured on the windows and more pictures of the bar area inside??? kinda weird...  Don't go here before 12 on Saturday!!!

my first yelp! review, and it's because of Yasu...I decided to take my friend here for her birthday based all the great reviews. She loves sushi and I was looking for a great place out of (north) Scottsdale and the seen/be seen crowd that tends to exist in that area.  Wow! What a great place. Service - wonderful - impeccable, menu selection - wonderful, food - wonderful. We sat at the bar to wait for a table and the bartender suggested a few items to try since we hadn't been there. Happy to say I listened and was thoroughly impressed - the black cod was absolutely delicious. I will definitely go back . Oh, and my friend's drink, the appletini, she said was probably the best she's had (it's a Ringotini with a little something extra). We even got a little Japanese language lesson :)  If you go - Make a reservation! I didn't realize they took reservations so waited, however the wait wasn't long at all. Great place for a date, or friends and even family.

I work VERY close to Switch so come here often when employees are in town or just going out to have lunch with boss, etc.  I've never had a bad experience here - I don't find the wait staff to be overly nice but not rude either. They ask me what I want, i tell them and i get it!  Unlike several other reviews I find their menu to be good - it is an American restaurant afterall so naturally they serve sandwiches, salads, soups, other similar entrees.  I also don't agree that their food is bland - and I'm the type of person to go out on a limb to try new things and I like bold foods.  I really like the hummus app here, however I never have tried it at Fez so might need to get over there soon.  At different times I've had sandwiches, salads and most recently the gallette.  So far all have been good.  The gallette is a flaky pastry filled with some sort of meat, cheese and veggie. As expected it was a little oily but very good too. Came with asparagus cooked just how I like it.  I really don't have any complaints about the place.  Perhaps it's because it is the closest restaurant to our workplace so feel loyal, or maybe because I only come here over the lunch hour and b/c it is lunch hour don't expect much? Whatever the case, I enjoy Switch.

I went here last night with a couple other ladies.  The garden-feel outdoor patio was great - the trees that hung over and created a canopy made it feel very cozy but it wasn't cramped at all.   I had no reason to go inside so can't comment on that. I have to say the live music was way TOO LOUD and our conversation went from normal speaking to nearly screaming across a small table. And then we had those awkward moments where someone - usually me - was talking and the song was suddenly over and that word that just started coming out of your mouth is loud enough for everyone to hear. not cool.   On to the food...we tried the cheese plate - I really liked the manchego and drunken goat (don't ask me what it is other than made out of goat's milk and really tasty) but would try something other than the gorgonzola...generally I like gorgonzola but something about it didn't appeal to me.  We also got the meat plate - sausage chorizo (as you can imagine it was on the oily side), prosciutto and salami.  Suprisingly, the salami was my favorite. I probably wouldn't do the meat plate again.  Wine - I only tried one, La Yunta, (a white wine) based off a review I saw. I'm not a wine expert nor pretend to be one so here's my comment - I like it. I would get it again.  I liked it so much I had 3 glasses so I really liked it!   The customer service - probably the best part. The hostess and our waitress were very nice -- not pushy (on time), no attitude.  To me the customer service is the biggest part of an experience. Next time I'd go back I'd hope to have the same waitress and try a panini (they were big enough for 2 people to easily split and be full).  I really wish the music would have been a little lower-volume. It was nice music, I like that they have live music, it was just too loud. I think it started around 7 or so and the hour we had before the music was nice. I'll go back, just early enough to have some "quiet time" and try something else from their limited menu. Definitely would have the drunken goat again :)

I was gonna give three stars to denote "a-ok" and then I decided four stars for "yay! i'm a fan" -- why? Because I purposely went back here and took a friend.   I would be lying by omission if i didn't tell you that part of the reason I wanted to go back here was for the ladies restroom ;)  What? can't a girl like a fun toliet?   I also purposely chose the rolls that DIDN'T use tortillas as the wrap. It seemed really, really off the first time I came here and tried the Gaijin which uses tortillas.  The chicken gyoza has been delicious both times, i wish they served more than 5. The other rolls we tried and that were tasty were: Spicy Tuna, Foku and J-Pop. Was it the best in town? probably not. but did it satisfy? most certainly.  The drinks?  Mmm Mmm Good! My friend had the Turning Japanese (which I tried as a shot the first time I went and either it was made really sweet, or it tastes super sweet after the Mango Sake) and she thought it was delicious - so delicious she had 3.  I had the Hello Kitty and it was delicious - so delicious I had 3.  Probably my only negative is the music was too loud. I think that it might just be me though...  Oh, judging by the lovely lady crawling up the pole in a karaoke room where the door was open (from the outside of the restaurant) -- that could be a REAL. GOOD. TIME.  Might have to try that - the karaoke room, not the pole!

Ok, I'm mixed on this place here. And surprisingly it's because of the HOSTESSES and the chicken egg rolls. I brought my toddler here to introduce him to an old friend (old as in "been friends a long time" not as in "she's over the hill").  I generally am VERY unimpressed by the young hostesses manning the lists/seat assigning at restaurants.  However, one lady in particular was great. I'll save the boring details having to do with getting a table with a toddler, but she was great. They noticed how restless my son was getting waiting for a table and was great in getting us in.  She also entertained my son at dinner which any of you with young children know, dining out is a gamble!    The waiter, not so great and that's part of the reason for only 2 stars. We ordered the southwest chicken egg rolls for an appetizer and I got the sliders with cheese thinking my son would like them. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the sliders, the fries were ok, although I could make better ones at home in my oven (main reason for 2 stars). However, the egg rolls were DELICIOUS. If i came back here again I would get those and a salad as my meal and pray to the heavens the salad was better than the sliders.  Here's why I'll come back:  halfway place to meet my friend, great egg rolls (wow could i mention those things any more in my post?), but above all, KID FRIENDLY and great service by the hostess. I definitely wouldn't come back for the sliders - blegh.

Went here with my 2.5 yo son, 2 girl friends and their 1.5 and 2 yo children.  So since I'm a momma any place that "allows" children (really, just has paper menu and crayons and little juice cups with a lid and straw) and is patient, is automatically a 3 star.   But even better the food was delicious - had the chicken quesadilla (from appetizer menu) and a southwest caesar salad since my toddler prefers salad to chicken strips! Ah, saves me about $6 in uneaten kid food. Yay kid.     Another plus: Staff was nice, didn't feel rushed even though it was busy. Oh, and cornbread. YUM cornbread! Oh and the chips and salsa.  I think we had probably 3 chip basket refills, probably mostly because of moi.

So I read some reviews about this place and several other eyecare joints. It seems eyecare service in Phx as a whole is not so great. Why did I go here?  1. It's very close to where I live. This is even more important because glass purchase is for my toddler child which means I'll probably be visiting often. 2. Toddler glasses. Do you know how few eye places have toddler frames in house to try on? I can count on half a hand.  I'll say the relationship started out GREAT. Then got BAD. Then was OK. And is now back to GOOD which is why I selected 4 * "Yay! I'm a fan." I'm nudging back to GREAT.  The GREAT: they have baby/toddler frames IN HOUSE. a LARGE selection at that. Visited, decided on a style I liked. They were happy to order a few pairs in different colors for me to look at. YES!  The BAD: I didn't hear from them when I thought the frames were supposed to be in. I called. I was on hold FOREVER (no really, for 52 minutes until I hung up and called back. They apparently had a miscommunication within themselves. I was working while on hold and just wanted to see how long I really would be on hold.).  The order wasn't going to be until X day. i think they forgot to order them.  The OK: Frames are in! They take our insurance and we pay the difference. The glasses came back VERY QUICKLY. YAY. (the GREAT)  The GOOD: I ordered frames from elsewhere and brought them in to have lenses placed. Since I had previous purchased glasses within 3 mos I got a large discount (since no more covered by INS). YAY. Glasses came in again very quickly.  I have been here 5 times? now in just 3 months. Most recently was when my adorable little munchkin broke a piece off.  Not frames I bought from them but they fixed it right there at no charge. The Bad left a very bitter taste in my mouth but I'm glad I didn't jump ship because every other encounter has been good. Also, I find their prices to be pretty on par with other places, including online (not the cheapy over seas places) and they include a 2 year warranty on lenses (which I haven't seen INCLUDED at any online place).   Oh, and 3/4 employees I've dealt with have been very helpful and nice. the other 1 is working on it from what I can tell. nice to see improvement.

Fantastic! From the moment we walked in to moment we left, this was a fantastic experience. Staff was friendly but gave us space, the food was superb. The appetizer of rice ball thing was really unique and delicious. The prinicipe pizza was so good I wish I could have eaten the whole thing. Our server was awesome and it's a great location and ambiance. I'd like to go next door to try toscana next. I'll definitely be back. Most likely later this week. Oh, and they have a few gluten free options if you have a diner who requires that.
