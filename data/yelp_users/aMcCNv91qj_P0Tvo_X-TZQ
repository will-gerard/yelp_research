I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with,   I brought my car for a few touch ups, my trunk the back shield,  and the grill for bugs, and dash/cup holder area.  My car was parked for 10 min before I asked when they would notify me it's was complete.  They had a system error, and refused to honor my groupon. I was advised to contact corporate.  After 20 min on hold the girl who answered indicated someone would call me back.    I asked about my car,  the agent went outside and then came back and indicated it was done.   The bugs were still all over the grill,  cup holders and dash hadn't been touched,  car was clearly not vacuumed,  neither was the trunk. The service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs, as I became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash.  I went inside and asked for a refund.  A gentleman told me I was just upset because of the groupon. I continued to advise it was the half hearted car wash that had me upset.  To which he continued to rebuttal that I was just upset about the Groupon.   Another associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong.  I pointed out the various items and he indicated he would fix the situation.  I ended up waiting near the detailing crew, who didn't hide the use of profanity. They we're shouting insults to one another. Not the most professional display,  even for a car wash.   Eventually I got my car,  still not vacuumed thoroughly and left.  Safe to say after coming sporadically (as needed) fire 7 years,  I'm fine not coming back to Dannys with the hit and miss service and bad car washes

I come here every month, I drive past countless barber shops to get here from the SE Valley I try to come early because they are consistently busy. Between tip and cut I usually spend 20 to 30 max. I know that when I come here I will wait. I come here because I like they haircut they provide me, I don't consider myself picky but certainly won't go to a Great Clips. My hair is consistently cut to my standards when I come.  Unfortunately this is the only thing that is consistent. As I sit here writing this review I have been waiting for my hair cut for 1 hour and 45 min. Knowing coming in I'd be waiting the hair sweep/host kindly let me know it'd be 30 min. He's was friendly but grossly inaccurate. (Little guy in NY Knicks hat)  This time as with many times prior, 3 of the barbers have been back and forth in the back room devouring food that was brought in. One was chatting it up about the Golden State/Portland Game. One of the stylist who've I've seen here many times before brought in her two boys for haircuts on her day off, which cut everyone else in line and Enoc was kind enough to take. (Keep in mind my 9 yo is waiting for me to finish..  Alfredo doesn't work with numbers apparently, as a number of his friends seem to come in ask for a cut and wait for him to finish his cut and then calls them without number. He also took time for friends and a little miss to tell him all about their purchases.  They real losers aside for lost customers are the women who work here. While waiting today for every one haircut Alfredo has done today theyve got 3 out. Francisco who isnt here today is the ome exception as ive always viewed him working hard. Everyone here is well acquainted I can see and sense the feelings of family through their interactions over the last 3 years I've come here. But this is also a business, they come to work, and I come to pay money for a haircut. As I too have a family, as a single dad my daughter has to wait here while I get my haircut. I have to say, I love looking my best and come here for the caliber of haircut. I pay more to be here on Sunday like today or come earlier during the week. I draw a number to have my turn in order that I arrived. If they quote a time I'd like it to be accurate to the time frame, doesn't have to be spot on, but somewhere in the ball park, and it's frustrating that this is consistently their business model, it seems to leave one wondering why have numbers if you won't go in order? Why come to work if your going to spend it talking with family? I appreciate the mentality but it sucks for paying customers who would rather be at home with family. Everyone is friendy but it isn't  something that's worth the wait or the money. From another perspective I've also sent countless people here we've just opened a new hub with 9000 jobs here in tempe on of our offices is 1 mile away.  I can't refer this barber to anyone.  It's time to find a new barber. Pretty sure there's a new barber shop on the other side of the mall. Since starting this review I'm still waiting coming up on 2 hours and still not up. #disappointedforthelasttime

First and last time here... hostesses were rude. Especially the elderly woman who was presumably supervising was rude,  and although Sundays are understandably busy, I don't think she should let her frustrations translate through to her guests.  We were quoted us the wrong wait time of 25 min after 39min when we asked were advised of would be another 35 min in a very abrasive manner.  We left and we won't find out if the food was worth the wait because of the rudeness of the host staff.  When spending $ service is almost as important as the food

This was my firat Peruvian restaurant.  I had a friend reccomend and meet me here. It turned out to be delicious. It was a quaint location, service was friendly and pleasant. The food was delicious, our server made  a reccomendation for their most popular dish. Loved it. Would recxomend it and go again for sure. Wish it was a little cleaner in appearances.  But thought it was great.
