Been here for 5 years, at least once a month, lines are getting longer, but thats because prices are getting cheaper, but the sushi is always consistently good and its always a fun and cheap experience. It's not cuisine food but it kills the sushi craving and also I've never gotten sick!! I think I've recruited 20 new friends to this place =)  CONS-I wouldn't eat the mussels or octopus here, I dunno about its quality, but it just tastes "fishier" to me than finer sushi restaurants...

Got tickets for a friend's birthday on a Friday night. There were 8 in our group, and 2 of our friends forgot to purchase tickets online so the bouncer wouldn't let them in to purchase tickets. After they were kicked out of line, I asked another employee (maybe a manager?) where to purchase tickets, and he pointed to the back of the line that we were all JUST standing in. No one was helpful, and was altogether very neglectful and uncompromising. Plus, the ticket was not worth $25. Nothing new to see here, music wasn't even the DJ's original, and was a basic mix at most. Would've had the same experience at the other clubs for much less, plus more accommodation.   The best part were the mermaids dancing from the ceiling. Although half the time it looked like they were just tangled in their nets. An extra star for mermaids, though.
