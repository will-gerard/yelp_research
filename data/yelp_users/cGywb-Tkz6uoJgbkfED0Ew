Just went through the drive thu and ordered food and it was cold ordered coffee with 2 cream get home no cream foods cold so I call the mgr and she rushes me off the phone while I'm trying to tell her my issue and says just come in will replace it .Thats all fine and dandy but maybe we could learn how to do a easy job and be more attentive to our customers needs .

I was in the parking lot of Walmart waiting on my wife to come out from shopping when I noticed some one leaving with un bagged merchant Items running out of lawn and garden and a fast past to get away hum guess he got away with that one . Maybe you should beef up your security a little more on the night shift .
