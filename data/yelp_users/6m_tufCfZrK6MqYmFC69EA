First off i have to say that today's lunch here was very refreshing was so happy to finally find a Thai Rest that was so friggin good. Almost as good as my beloved Pong Sri In NYC China Town.I've learned over the years that if they can make a simple dish of Phad Thai and Chicken with yellow curry,It's all good with me.So as i ordered the the above mentioned they served a bowl of soup and a spring roll with my order,was very happy with it good flavors and staff was really great.Then it was time for the main dish and i was really impressed with how fast it came out and flavor-full it was.Infact i was so pleased that i ordered a second helping of Phad Thai for late nite noshing.Being from NJ/NY area where food is the King i have to say again that i will be back and others should go here as well.I traveled over 40 miles from Maricopa (Pinal County) to come eat here.There's no such thing as too far to go for a great meal.I've been real disappointed so far with alot of the restaurants we've visited.Adios Amigos

Don't waste your money, it's the worst Chinese food ever!!!  Just picked up an order of chicken lo mein for dinner. I ordered a pint and they made a quart,  told lady I wanted a  small, she smiled and said sorry we made a large and walked away. These people need to learn how to season and cook food. Absolutely freaking awful.  Would have been better to have skipped dinner and just thrown the money in the trash. Stay far away or make your own Chinese home.

Good food for the price.We went their for my girlfriends b-day and were really happy with the food,service was ok the girl was a bit annoying coming over way too many times to ask if we were ready to order Entee's,we were waiting for a few more people to come,we had a bunch of apps ( Thai Toast,Sate,Fried Calamari and Shrimp Rolls, the calamari was reall really good.Nice and crispy), on the table.I got the the yellow curry with chicken,my GF got phad thai as usual,it was missing a little something just can't put my finger on it but the food was good none the less.It's not the best i've had since coming to AZ but i'll come back again fo sure.

Update..........  Ughhhhhhhhhh as it happens like oh so many times this place now really has gone down hill.I had just given it a real great review on 12/20/10 and when we went there yesterday for mothers day lunch IT WAS AWFUL.!!!  Why,why,why dammit! do restaurant owner ruin a good thing when it's going well,eveytime i have been there it has been busy and i had been there at all different times of the day and week to see how the food was to compare it each time.This time the appetizer was terrible fried chix toast was greasy,fish cakes tasted old,the spring rolls were inedible.Chix sate was made w/dark meat and the peanut sauce was too runny and flavorless,Phad Thai was bland w/no tofu or eggs(they're actually charging $1.50 for a single egg to add) i had the green curry w/ chix and it was runny and flavorless as well.It really SUCKED!!!! and we wont be going back anytime soon.

Terrible,terrible,terrible.....  that's only way to describe this place,we stopped in for some take out on cinco de mayo it by far the worst meal EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I ordered a chicken chimi and my GF got the rolled tacos platter,ughhhhh OMG  it was terrible.I got so sick after eating here that we'll never go back.This is as bad as it gets,after my first bite i knew something was up,it just tasted off.I thought it was me but after my GF tried she too said something wasn't rite.I left it on the table for a bit cause i really thought that it was my taste buds messing with me and had a few more bites and had to stop.Not long after eating this meal i started to feel queasy and then outta no where i was off to hurl into the bowl.After hurling my insides out and chugging a bottle of pepto and 50 or so tumms i made it out alive.My GF tacos were flavorless but the rice and beans were good.I have made up my mind and that is i will no longer buy mexican food from a restaurant out here( except for Nandos Cantina inGilbert),i will make it @ home where i'm in control of everything that goes into my food and i know that it'll be awesome.Adios Amigos

I have been going to see Dr. Kesara for the past 6 months. He and his staff have been treating me better than any place I've ever been. The  staff are the best at what they do and are always courteous.
