I've always thought MWC had a great visual atmosphere, the colors and the artwork were great,  but I never really connected to the place and their wine list was not interesting until now...  New owners took over November '11 and the vibe has changed for the better.  The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  Its the kind of place you can go to alone and make immediate friends with the other customers and the staff.  The wine list has greatly improved and since they brought in a new chef (Sarah) the food is absolutely mouth watering.    They have a great happy hour on food and wine and their regular Saturday tastings are a great way to find new and different wines.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the wines they serve, which helps make a great wine bar.  Fantastic patio with live music on the weekends - this is the perfect spot for a group of friends or date night.  I'm starting to become a regular and I don't even live close by.

Its great to walk into a place and be greeted right away, and when you return they remember you.  Customer service is a lost art in most establishments, not at Terroir.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the wines they carry and they will let you taste what they are pouring by the glass if you are having trouble making a decision.  The cheese selection is great and the staff will recommend what goes with your wine.  Great wines, comfortable seating, great atmosphere, wifi, fantastic patio, and you can bring your dog, can't beat it.

Accompanied with four fellow foodies we hit Deseo for Restaurant Week.  I'm glad I ended the week with Deseo because nothing could compare.  I started with the ceviche, a perfect start to any meal, the fish was fresh the sauce was perfect, it didn't over power the taste of the fish which most sauces tend to do.  Second course- Kobe skirt steak, cooked perfectly on a bed of onions, so tender, so flavorful (complete opposite of the kobe steak I had at Bourbon)  Third Course - chocolate cigar and chocolate gelato, not too rich, perfect pairing excellent finish.  I went to three dinners during restaurant week and Deseo was hands down best from start to finish.  Also, it was the only one that didn't make me feel like I had to roll myself home.  Worth every penny of their regular menu.

having been to Fuego for group events I thought it would be good to go back with my girl friends for a regular dinner.    I made a reservation for 7:30, when we arrived we were still waiting for one more so they had us sit in the center of the patio on the bench instead of seating us at our table.  The patio was almost full but not out of control.    After about 10 minutes the hostess asked us if we would like a drink and if we would be more comfortable at our table.  We chose to sit at our table and waited for a server to come by, we waited...and waited....and waited.  After 30 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order I went to the hostess to complain and put in an order for a bottle of wine.  About 20 minutes later a server came by with the bottle, the bottle was corked, not all that uncommon, I ordered another bottle and was brought 10 minutes later, the wine was fine, we asked if we could place our food order, we had already been sitting at the table for more than an hour at this point.  He said "I will be back in 30 seconds", about five minutes later he came back to take our order.  The server returned 20 (we started watching the clock and keeping track since they never acknowledged us for drinks) and said "I'm just going to put the words out there and bear the brunt of what I get...we are out of mashed potatoes."   I could not believe that he started what he had to say like that, and that he didn't have anything in his hand to make up for the inconvenience of our entire meal by this point.  We adjusted our orders (we all ordered mashed potatoes).  Our food arrived 10 minutes later, vegetables were cold, meat was good.  I should mention that about 45 minutes after we sat down a 12 top sat down right behind us, their food and drinks arrived much before our own - we had the same server.    Having held group events at Fuego I was incredibly disappointed that they could not handle a simple table of 4.  We asked the server what the problem was and he said that they checked their numbers from last year and they were not that busy in June and July.  He also mentioned that their most seasoned server was on vacation - one server does not make the restaurant funciton. They should have checked their numbers from last week, not last year, their popularity has increased over the last year.  Such a disappointment.

I knew that Fuego was better than they performed that night  I was there for dinner.  I just had to go back, I went for lunch and service could not have been better.  Greeted with a smile immediately, waters on the table as we were seated, cocktails made perfectly - not everyone knows how to make a good mai tai or a mojito!    The chili relleno was outstanding, the hard exterior and the outstanding chicken and cheese inside was the perfect Friday lunch, the mai tai just topped it off.  Looking for a good dessert place, Fuego has what you need, the chocolate cake was phenomenal.  Sitting inside was new for me but it was way to hot mid day to sit outside, the interior is just as cute as the outside.  I know I will be back again!

I have visited Hana twice now and both times were excellent.    Both times the service was excellent the girls that waited on us were fun and didn't mind that we wanted to sit and chat and we weren't in a rush to get back to work.    The sushi rolls were interesting, they have the standard rolls that all sushi places have (tuna, yellow tail, california, etc.) but their signature rolls were crazy, for example, the Volcano Roll - california roll draped in white fish and a spicy mayo sauce baked to perfection  What surprised me the most, I asked for gluten free soy sauce, not only did they have gluten free sauce but they had low sodium gluten free sauce!  Their prices are the same as any sushi place in town.  What sets them apart other than their great service and fun fish combos, its BYOB, I really need to remember that for next time and bring a bottle of wine.

I've been to Armitage several times for dinner and wine but went for the first time for brunch this week.  Their brunch menu has everything from pancakes, peanutbutter crusted french toast, breakfast burritos, omlets and chicken fried steak - not something I would have pegged a wine bar to have.  They also have unlimited mimosas ($10), bloody marys ($3) and a specialty breakfast drinks menu ($5-10).  We arrived at 10:30, the place was empty, we stayed until about noon and there were only three tables filled, very different from their evening atmosphere.  The food was good, I prefer their dinners but good for the reasonable prices.    Beginning in October they will have live music during Sunday brunch, will definitely go back to check it out.

I've been a fan of D'Vine in Chandler for some time now and I had the pleasure of attending their Wine 101 class recently.      The class was presented by David Newton, D'Vine's Sommelier.  The topics discussed during class included: serving wine, different regions and the best regions for certain grapes, and a little history of wine.  David has a great passion for wine and is an engaging speaker, so it made for a great afternoon.  The wines chosen for the class were excellent, and offered something for every palate.  This particular class was not designed specifically for tasting, although there will be a class devoted to how to taste wine in the future, this was about wine in general, which I found to be a great place to start.  There will be a different class each month through March on a variety of topics and are being held at both Mesa and Chandler locations.   This is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in wine and meeting people with the same interest.  Can't wait for the next class!

The ambiance of Eddie's House really can't be beat, the dining room is romantic for a date, the patio is excellent for a family gathering, the bar area is lively and social with fantastic bartenders.  The food is delish and kitchen is fantastic about catering to food allergies.  Bring a date, bring your parents, bring your friends, you won't be disappointed

Brought a group to Metro for brunch, made the reservation a month ago, called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation. Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate.   Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us.   I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro.   They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.  Update 11/8/2010 Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.    We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.  Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.  We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.  Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.

I had been to Avalon for brunch a while back and found the food to be fantastic so I decided to join them for Restaurant Week.  Glad I did  I love the ambiance of the place, quiet, calm, music at the right volume and the right music (I am beginning to think restaurants don't understand how important this is).  The service is outstanding.  I ordered the Ricotta dumplings (aka gnocchi) - absolutely the best flavor of the night, it was a party in my mouth.  I will be going back soon to have this again.  My top sirloin was cooked perfectly, while a little tough the seasoning was perfect.  The potatoes were delish and a nice cheesey crust that paired well with the steak.  Flourless chocolate cake was rich but tastey.  Their winelist is good, a little merlot heavy, and it doesn't match the one they have on their website but still good and FYI Wednesday night is half price bottle night.  It surprised me that the restaurant wasn't more crowded, this place should be slammed every night for the excellent service and the fantastic food.  I will definitely be back.

I was excited to try Posh because you write down what you don't like or can't eat and they get creative for you, I've got food intolerances so I was looking forward to a chef willing to cook what I could eat.  So disappointing. Very mediocre food.   1st Course Friend: soup, she said it was great Me: micro greens with watermelon and a "mist of lemon vinaigrette"   2nd course  Friend: soft shell crab, which she said was really good  Me: baby clams that were tasteless.    3rd Course:  Friend: big piece of quail with a vegetable Me: 3 small pieces of duck with some spinach  4th Course: Friend: flourless chocolate torte with berries Me: rum raised pineapple slice - took one bite and pushed it aside    I felt like I was being punished because of my food issues. Maybe I was jealous of her meal because everything she was served was something I could eat! Way too much money spent.      The service was good.

Poorly dressed sales ladies in a sea of amazing gowns...just doesn't work.  The dresses are amazing and you can work with a designer to tweak the dress to exactly what you want but why would you listen to someone talk about a dress that costs as much as your mortgage that can't be bothered to wear a bra or a girl that wears jeans and flip flops  Edited since Meghan L's response to my review:  These girls represent Lillian Lottie Brand.  I can't imagine that that's the image you want to put out there.  The service does not make up for the way these girls were dressed, its about the whole package. I completely understand working on your feet for 12 hours and flip flops would be the worst shoe for support.  How about a simple pair of flats, every store has sales, and if you don't pay your employees enough to purchase proper shoes or bras then there's a bigger issue that needs to be dealt with here.   If your sales girls need assistance with getting themselves dressed properly for a high end boutique I am happy to come in and assist them, would even be willing to give them clothes our of my own closet if they cannot afford new things.  Meghan has updated her comment to me three times in one day, the first comment she called me shallow.  Beware.

It is unusual for me to arrange an event at a location I have never been to but on the advice of a friend I threw caution to the wind and was glad I did.   The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their wines. They were able to connect the guests with the wines they were likely to enjoy just by asking a few questions, something some wine bars are not able to do.   I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza which was just fantastic, their crust was not too thick and not too thin which was perfect for this former New Yorker.   I went back a few weeks later and enjoyed the Rondelle Four Cheese, which is pasta sheets rolled with mozzarella, fontina, blue cheese, Parmesan and spinach and baked in tomato sauce, absolute heaven. My friend had the chicken parm which is basic but their sauce is so good you don't notice that its something as simple as chicken parm. Also try the farmers pasta, you can't go wrong with sausage, chicken and fire roasted peppers.   I will absolutely be back!

Looking for a place at 8:30 on a Friday night without a long wait is not easy in Scottsdale. While driving around I called to inquire as to the wait time for a table (knowing the place was not big), I was told they would have a table in about 15 minutes, when we arrived 10 minutes later we were seated immediately.    Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to make a decision, ultimately I chose the lamb and my dining companion chose the chicken.  The lamb was incredible and cooked perfectly; on a bed of fingerling potatoes, snap peas and olives, with just the right amount of mint; there was a little too much oil on the vegetables, this may have just been due to the olives.   I was able to sample the chicken and found it to be perfect, not dry and perfectly seasoned.  If only chicken could always taste that good.  Hopefully the chicken will still be on the menu when I go back!

I can't even describe the sound a friend made when she bit into the pretzel with the sauce that came with it, definitely had a mouth gasm.  We ordered deviled eggs, pretzels, chicken lollipops, classic wedge salad, butter lettuce salad and the mac and cheese.  Everything was fantastic, the mac and cheese however is AMAZING and a bargain on their happy hour menu, which is avaiable every day.  (don't go by their website for HH, there is a special short menu for HH, prices ranging from $4-$9)  I love the ambiance of Mabel's, old school decor, reminds me of places in NYC, not Scottsdale.  The staff is all extremely friendly and helpful with menu questions.  Rent out their speakeasy room for a private party, you and your guests will not be disappointed.

Vladamir is FABULOUS! A few days ago my washing machine over flowed. I finally sucked it up and called around for some rate quotes.  I like that his fee to come out was waived if he performed the service.  He explained to me what he thought was going on and told me how much it would be, but then as he looked at the machine he tried something else and was the fix that it needed.  He also told me how to keep it from happening again and if it did happen again, I know how to fix it myself.  Honest repair man.  Don't find too many of those around.

Always hesitant about using a new hair stylist, I went to Deana at a friend's recommendation.  From the moment I sat down she made me feel comfortable, taking the time to listen to what I was looking for and what I like.    We discussed color and she was able to figure out exactly what I was looking for.  She applied it to my hair and we waited, I think that's probably the worst part, just sitting waiting, but I wasn't nervous - that was a good thing.  Hair was washed and included a scalp massage, so relaxing I could have stayed there all day!  Time to cut, we discussed length and style and as I watched her snip away I knew I was getting a great cut.  She took the time to blow dry and style and I couldn't have been happier with what she did. However, the real test is doing it yourself at home.  After my first wash and blow dry myself I couldn't believe what a difference a good cut made.  I didn't realize how poorly my last stylist cut until I went to Deana.  Even after a couple of weeks my hair is still fabulous, I haven't had a bad hair day and that's surprising to me!!  Highly recommend Deana, so glad I listened to my friend and went to see her

Saturday afternoon a couple of friends and I thought this would be a great place to go before our evening festivities.  We were the only people on the patio and I did not see anyone inside.    Tables on the patio - the benches don't line up with the table. The table is about 5 inches too short for the benches.  It looked as though I didn't belong at the table.    The server came over quickly after I sat down, he asked what I would like to drink, followed by, "other than water, its on its way out."  I asked for a taste of a wine from the menu, which he brought promptly and when I told him I didn't care for it he graciously offered other suggestions that he allowed me to taste.  He'd now been back to the table 4 times and each time I reminded him about my water and I still did not receive it until one of my friends forcefully told him I still needed water.  Drinks all set we start looking at appetizers - their Facebook page advertises $5 happy hour, in reality they have about 4 glasses of wine and a few vodka drinks for $5, there is no food in the "$5 happy hour."    We ordered the meat and cheese combo, it arrived with pita, grapes and MOLDY strawberries!  Yes moldy!  I immediately brought the plate to the bar and asked for a new plate.  Its not as if the strawberries were merely placed on the board, there were sliced and carefully arranged - how did the chef/cook/person slicing not notice there was blue mold all over the strawberry?  We also ordered the buffalo wing dip and a tenderloin sandwich, the dip was good, the sandwich was meh.  My friend had told the server at the beginning of us ordering food that she was planning on ordering a certain dessert.  So when we finished our appetizers she asked him for the specific dessert he said that they were no longer serving it.  This seems like something he could have told her the first time she mentioned it.  Hopefully they work out the kinks and fix the tables.

Never disappointed. (I'd say that about all of the Upward Project restaurants though.)  I've been to FP a few times now and have to say, its always been a pleasant experience, good wait staff, chill vibe, not to loud and not rushed.    Today I had the salad chop, it was good, I can't figure out the dressing but I have no complaints, I'll let them keep their secret.  We had the brussel sprouts with pancetta, a little bit heavy on the lemon but we still ate the entire thing.  The beets with pears was strange, good, but strange, not sure I would order it again.  The wine list is good, I'm particularly fond of the Sivas-Sonoma Cab.   I'll be back, no question there.

Have driven past so many times thought it was about time I tried The O Bar.  I should have kept driving.... Absolutely awful.  My friend and I went for lunch, we sat at the bar thinking it would be faster and the place was completely empty - that should have been our first clue.   I ordered chicken wings with red hot sauce.  The wings were not even covered in sauce, as if the cook drizzled the hot sauce over them after they were on the plate.  A few of the wings were not fully cooked.  Wings are not that difficult to make, not sure how anyone fails at cooking wings. My friend ordered the nachos, huge towering plate of nachos, she said they were just "meh" The bartender would not shut up, he kept chatting with us even when we ignored him so we could chat with each other.   Stay away.  Much better food any where else!

I absolutely love Shabu!  My first experience was fantastic.  I don't consider myself a picky eater but I do have a lot of restrictions (no gluten, grains, dairy, etc.) Shabu was the first place I've been to where I could eat all but 6 things on the menu.  I love the variety of broths that they offer and the list of vegetables is extensive that everyone will find something they want.  We had the steak, chicken, shrimp and pork loin - the meats were quality and the vegetables fresh.  I can't wait to go back!

Monday's are flight night ($10) with 80s music, feel free to dress 80s style!  I love what the owners have done with the space, it's romantic if you want it to be and great for groups with a separate space if you need it.  The servers are fun and friendly,  they know their wine.  The food is fantastic and it's great that they have gluten free options available.  Live music on the weekends, feel free to dance if the mood strikes you.  Highly recommend MWC Bistro
