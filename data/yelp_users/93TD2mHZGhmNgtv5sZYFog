Meh.  The products are overly scented and not very effective.  The experience I've had when shopping has been lukewarm.  The associates aren't bad.  They just give canned phrases like "Can I help you find anything" and "I'm blah blah blah if you need anything."  I want to have a friendly interaction and find something with someone who genuinely wants to help me, not someone who is worried about making a quick sale.  BBW is not really known for providing stellar service; the products match.

What a lovely wild mushroom and wild truffle oil pizza!  Every time I've gone to this location, I've had a warm greeting from the host and a manager has come to the table to check on our meal.  While the service could have  been quicker (they got seated multiple large tables in a short period of time during our stay), the server was attentive and friendly.  I feel a little spoiled when I get to eat here because of all the lovely dishes and the options for drinks and tiny nibbles.  Thank you!

Usually, I'm skeptical of big box chains, especially pet stores.  I guess I've seen too many news stories about puppy mills and the horrible treatment of animals in pet stores.  I came to Petco for one of their adoption events and discovered a friendly place with a wide range of knowledge.  For starters, Petco doesn't sell dogs.  They prefer to partner with local charitable organisations.  I like that Petco links up with area shelters to find great dogs (and cats) homes.  My little pup was a rescue dog and has been one of the best dogs ever.  Enough of that.  This isn't a review of the Cutest Dog in the Free World.  If it were, the stars would be infinity googleplex.  Yes, that's an approximate rating.    After I'd decided to adopt my pup, I took her inside to get her the necessities.  The associates provided excellent assistance, from helping me select the right toys (educational vs. destructive), food (natural and with no additives), bedding (comfy and small enough for a little dog), and even presented us with coupons and treats.  It's obvious that the people who work there love animals, as everyone came up to provide pets and advice.  One would think that should be a prerequisite, but I have visited places where the staff seemed to hate animals.  Petco in Scottsdale was not of this ilk.  They even selected coupons that would reduce our final total, which is a nice touch.  Each time we've returned, we've gotten the same exceptional service.  The pup always gets petted and is excited to enter with me, and I am offered a great experience.  Well done, my new animal friends!  We (that is the Royal We of Stella Blue and me) will definitely be back.

I just took my little pup to this location for a groom, and while it was costly, the results were worth it!  She looks like a completely different, but equally cute dog!  YAY!

My little pup is a rescue girl, so she's a little nervous.  Countryside was professional and every person there seemed to love their job.  How many times have we visited places where the person seems to loathe life and their job?  From the initial phonecall--a pleasant and excited woman--to the warm front desk reception to the kind veterinary assistant to the concerned vet--everyone was marvelous.  Another reviewer mentioned that they took the time to bond with the pets, and that was also our experience.  How refreshing not to be rushed or have our pet's concerns be overlooked.  The rooms were private and clean, so my little Stella wasn't scared to be there.  While she didn't like having her temperature rectally taken (who really does, right?), she was much more relaxed than she might have been with lesser people.  The diagnosis was kennel cough.  They gave us antibiotics with explicit instructions and even introduced us to an organic variety of pill-hider that Miss Stella went wild over.  We also found during our visit that Countryside offers grooming services.  The groomer introduced herself to us and had a lovely manner with our dog.  Lastly, they sent us home with a mug of treats and a stuffed toy that our dog absolutely loves.  WOW.  And it's a mere few blocks from where we live.  Consider us lucky.

I'm a purveyor of beauty products, it's true.  I have a long history in the industry, especially from my time with a little company called Aveda.  One would think that because I spent time doing make-up and massages for women that I would know a thing or two about dyeing my hair.  Not so, true believers.  I know how to style my hair, but not how to dye it, beyond awful experiments with food colouring and Manic Panic dye in my mother's sink.    Since I've recently moved to Arizona and cash is a little tight, I've become desperate to replicate the pale champagne colour of my stylist without landing myself on the Ramen Noodle line.  Well, have no fear, Sally's here!  The place was hopping on a Sunday afternoon, which usually means substandard service.  Both girls were attentive.  One of the salesgirls followed me back to the dye section and gave me expert advice.  Rather than power-selling me, she instructed me on exactly what I'd need to use in order to duplicate a double-process and got me the right toner to keep it from getting brassy.  For you non-hair people, a double-process is when you use two different chemical processes on your hair.  It's commonly used for people who lighten your hair.  You bleach the hair and then, apply colour.  After she'd told me what to buy, she gave me explicit instructions on how to do it.    The salesgirl was an angel.  Not only did she save me money ($25 with tax as opposed to $100 to $200), but with her handy instructions, I was able to get the results I wanted.  What do you know?  It worked.  I'll definitely be back.  I'd always chalked Sally's up as a seedy pseudo-beauty store, but for now, at least until I'm rolling in the green again, I'll continue to visit it to maintain the look I want.  THANK YOU!

I'm utterly baffled by the other reviews of Lakeview at the Bay.  It sounds like a completely different place than the one I've grown to love and appreciate in the year that my husband and I have lived here.  The landscaping is gorgeous, a mixture of natural rocks and a stream that runs through the whole place.  Ducks and other wildlife often frequent the lawns.  Lakeview boasts not one but two pools with two jacuzzis.  One pool is huge, resort size, while the other one is smaller but by no means tiny.  In the summer, people are often barbecuing on the available grills or hanging out by the pool.    Our apartment boasts a patio, washer/dryers in the unit, walk-in closets, and two bathrooms.  Our fireplace is cozy in the wintertime.  Any time we've had minor issues (we're talking the pilot light on the fireplace going out or a drawer breaking), the people at the office have sent someone out as soon as possible and communicated what they were doing.  Any time we've visited the office, we've been met with friendly faces and genuine help.  They always give our dog, Stella treats.  It's a small thing, but it makes us feel very welcome.    Like I said, I'm completely confused by the other reviews.  I'm not saying they aren't valid.  They are simply the opposite of the experience my husband and I have had.  Our area is quiet and low-key.  If I had any complaint, it's that my downstairs neighbour smokes on his patio and the smoke drifts up into our house.  Second-hand smoke is dangerous!  Other than that, there's nothing I could possibly say that's negative.  One day, we'll get a house, and it will be a sad day that we have to leave here because it's simply beautiful.  Any time my friends visit, they comment on how fabulous our place is.  I'm proud to live here!

King's Fish House has become one of my favourite places for seafood.  Seattle is one of my homes away from home, so I am picky when it comes to my seafood preferences.  I want things to be fresh from the ocean and deliciously prepared.  The first time I went to King's, was after an afternoon of running errands.  I had seen it and been uncertain of what to think.  I was seated quickly and given sour dough bread quickly.  The lemondrop martini was perfect.  Many bars get this simple drink wrong, but not King's--it had the sugar rim and perfect balance of lemon juice, vodka, and other ingredents that I wanted. The raw oysters were delicious and presented appetizingly.  My trout almondine was flaky and fresh, served with a wonderful side of rosemary new potatoes.  I felt completely spoilt and decadent when I left.   My other visits have been equally stellar.  One time, the server offered to get me an item not on the regular menu: salmon served on a cedar plank.  The salmon was covered with a delicious assortment of spices and carmelized brown sugar.  It makes me want to get my own cedar plank for cooking.  I can't wait to go back!  The selection and freshness of the raw oysters alone are reasons to check it out, along with the retro decor.  KUDOS!

Having just moved, I have found myself in dire need of the little necessities you need to make an empty apartment into a dream pad.  Lowe's has served my needs very well.  One thing that I've noticed is that it doesn't matter when I've visited, I've always been greeted by a happy person who asks if I need help finding anything in a very genuine way.  Not every hardware store offers this.  Sure, I'd love to give my money to a mom and pop joint, but none exist in my area, so Lowe's has done its job.  Even better is their garden department.  Their prices are fair and the people really know their stuff.  Lowe's has a great policy for their plants; if the plant you purchase dies before a year, they either refund your money or replace your plant.  You can't go wrong with that.  I've purchased plants at other places and had those plants die within days of the transaction, despite my following directions to the letter.  It makes me feel a lot safer knowing that if something unforseen happens, I am covered.  Recently, this came in handy when a bougainvillea I purchased decided to shrivel up inexplicably.  I had lost my receipt, and Lowe's didn't make me feel bad about it.  They gave me a merchandise credit and tried to help me find another plant.  Even though I've got most of the gear I need for my new apartment, you bet I'll go back.  Their good customer service will see to that.  Plus, I've got some more ideas about more plants for my patio.  Like tattoos, once you get one, you can't stop.

West Elm offers an alternative to Ikea and Crate and Barrel.  The look is modern, the feel is timeless, and the pieces are great for people who don't want their home to be either masculine or feminine.  West Elm also has an eye towards eco-fashion and sustainability.  One can purchase recycled glass bottles or art made by an indie artist from scavenged materials.  You'll feel like you're getting something a little different from all the cookie-cutter home furnishings out there, and that something is sturdier and well-made.  When I visited the Scottsdale Quarter store, there were some associates who seemed a little "green"--i.e., they weren't sure what to do with a new customer.  There were plenty there that were seasoned--i.e., they greeted you promptly and tried to help you select your items.  When the store didn't have items I wanted, an associate helpfully (and smartly because then the store gets credit) found them for me online and arranged them to be shipped to my home.  I didn't ask her to do this, but she pulled me to the side and did so.  When I was looking for items to purchase from a display, another associate found them for me.  Lastly, before I left, all of my items were carefully packaged so that none of them would break before I got home.  I really appreciate the time the associates took to help me.  Before I made my visit to this location, I read the other reviews, preparing for the worst.  I didn't notice stained floors or dusty items.  Perhaps management has changed since then.  Everything was impeccable and well-organised.  My house thanks West Elm because I have quite simply, the coolest and cutest pad around now.

Anyone who knows me knows that I was a vegetarian for a long, long time, and even went down the vegan path a time or two.  A roadtrip through Texas destroyed that, however.  Now, I'm back on the meat wagon.  Why does that sound more perverse than I mean it to?  Anyway, this burger joint makes my conversion to the dark side complete.  My partner and I have gone there on several occasions, and it's all been consistently decadent.  Yes, the hamburgers are a bit salty, but isn't that the point?  Aren't you supposed to have a greasy burger after a night of fun?  I've had a number of items on their menu--from the fried pickles to the haystack onions to one of their delicious shakes--and nothing has disappointed.  Everything's been made exactly like I'd want it to be and nothing has failed to delight.  Sure, you don't want to eat here every day.  It's meant as a sinful treat, like on your cheat day during your regular healthy eating schedule.  I'd stay on the meat wagon, just to have one of their delicious burgers on an egg bun with sharp cheddar cheese any day!

We got a coupon on our windshield wiper for a free burger with the purchase of the same, and thought why not?  As others have said, the business is located in a strip mall.  Upon first glance, it looks like it won't be great. Once you walk inside, the place features interesting wood walls, a separate area for eating and playing pool, and a long expanse of bar.  There were tons of wide-screen televisions with many games to watch.  Our server, Blake, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  He helped my husband pick out the perfect beer.  The food was great.  My burger had brie and portobello mushrooms and was tender as could be.  My husband had another burger and reported that his was delicious as well.  The steak fries were peppered up, making ketchup unnecessary.  I can't recall the last time I've eaten fries and not needed the ketchup.  We played trivia and listened to music, while having drinks.  The place was rather slow, but I suspect that's just growing pains.  We have nothing bad to say about our experience.  If only all sports bars had the kind of service and food we had.  We are excited to go back!

J Crew is the proverbial mixed bag.  Maybe I'm spoilt.  When I lived in the Philadelphia area, the King of Prussia team was exceptional.  They knew the true art of selling, which is establishing a connection and offering a variety of choices.  Perhaps the Scottsdale store is simply understaffed or the people aren't invested in their jobs.  I am not certain what it is.  Every time I have visited--and I like to give a store several times to wow me--the employees are rushing around or chatting amongst themselves, just at two extremes.  No one seems very happy to be there.  At the end of both extreme is faulty customer service.  There is no sense of urgency or even of building.  Grab a shirt and you might wander around with it for a long time before someone wants to put it on the fitting room door.  The only time you do draw attention is when you scoop up a bunch of items, and then, the associates seem to be wanting to fight for the sale.  I love me some J. Crew, no doubt.  They are classic and yet current.  I would love shopping here more if the Scottsdale store could shore up their level of service with what the KOP location is doing.
