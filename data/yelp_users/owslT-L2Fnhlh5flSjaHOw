Hands down, this is some of the best tasting Mexican food in Phoenix. The staff is very friendly, recognizes just about all of their regulars and make you feel like family while at their restaurant. At times, the wait can be a little lengthy but it's worth the time and it allows you to enjoy more of their delicious salsa and chips. I recommend the chile relleno or red chile tamale.

This will easily be a place that I return to!! There are two sides to VinciTorios, a restaurant and a wine bar. The wine bar is large, feels very cozy and welcoming (as did the rest of the restaurant). Visited during dinner time and the restaurant was busy but the staff was all very friendly, seemed to be having a good time, they were well dressed neatly and did not seem rushed/distracted. Psss, ask for Tracy, she was awesome!   As a first time visitor it was comforting to hear all the "oooo's" and "ahhhh's" from surrounding tables as food was brought out. The portion sizes are great and you can taste that each dish is so delicately seasoned with pure passion! We found that ordering an appetizer along with 2 main dishes was a bit too much food but glad there's leftovers. A basket of warm bread with garlic spread is brought out to every table as well.

If you've been car shopping for a while, STOP! Look no further. If you haven't been shopping too long, STOP, drop and roll (or ride the bus) to Avondale Toyota and see Andy Price. First off, Andy was the most sincere, experienced and supportive sales person that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. He has a lot of experience doing what he does and it was definitely demonstrated in the fine work he did and the natural rapport he carries with people.      I visited Avondale Toyota after shopping around at a few other dealerships. My credit is HORRIBLE so every place I visited before Avondale Toyota had the same fairytale story-- "oh yea, we'll work with you, we'll give you the best deal." WRONG! At other dealers, the sales person disappears for a very long time, comes back, gives you a different price, goes away, comes back, gives you a lower price (wants more money down) but then that price changes to something a lot higher near the closing of the deal. NOTHING like this happened at Avondale Toyota. They are a no haggle dealer and their prices are quite competitive. Go ahead, start looking online at other dealers, this way at least you won't waste your time in person, you just waste time looking online (saves you gas too). I told Andy what I didn't want and he made sure to avoid those vehicles/cost ranges. Andy was both the sales person/finance manager for the deal, all in one--there was no going to a "back office" to see a separate finance person. Andy ran three different price scenarios, input numbers for warranties, GAP insurance, security options, took away things I didn't want, added things that were optional, etc. all right in front of me. I got to see the numbers modify allowing me to compare prices and make the most financially sound decision for me, without the HIDDEN COSTS and surprises. At the end of the deal, I knew exactly how much I was paying.     HIGHLY recommend Avondale Toyota but especially Andy Price, he can't be topped! Seriously. Why are you still reading this and why haven't you called him?

My hair is not hard to cut at all (at least in my opinion) but for whatever reason any other time I got it cut at places like Supercuts, Great Clips, EVEN Regis, it looked like s$%t! Never came out the way I wanted it to until I started coming here. I have been going to Rene for the past few months and she cuts great hair. Very personable, experienced and professional. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because she's always so booked and it's hard to get an appt. They accept debit/credit but there's always a sign asking to pay in cash if possible.

IF YOU LOVE CHIPOTLE LIKE I DO, DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. By far the worst chipotle location that I've ever visited. I ordered 3 Barbacoa tacos and the guy put a TINY bit of meat, when I asked for more he said "oh you want double meat?" No! I don't want double meat, I want enough meat to call it a damn taco. I asked for corn salsa, sour cream and cheese and I got sour cream and guacamole. Now,  I'm not complaining about the guac but I guess the cheese and corn salsa weren't important. The "double meat" sucked too. It didn't taste like other chipotle locations. The best part was the man scratching his crotch in the kitchen and then coming to "supervise" the good line.

Just renewed our lease to live here again. The property is VERY WELL kept, it's always clean, grass and trees look alive and the pool looks inviting every time -- you can tell the staff put in a lot of time and effort to maintain this property and keep it looking good. Maintenance staff is quick to respond and leave a printed summary of the work they did along with comments. Unlike other properties where the office staff are snooty, seem so separated, the staff here is friendly and even wave when seen on property! Just kind of gives a nice home, good neighbor feeling. There's plenty of space throughout the complex to walk your pet, jog, cook out. Have lived in apartments for years, nothing has come close to this one. Feels good to come home living here!

I've never had a negative experience, from the food to the laid back ambiance, friendly staff and deliciously crafted good-- it's worth any lengthy wait for a table, which you may encounter on a Sunday morning.   My personal lunch favorite is the gladiator burger. The red chile cheese sauce is mouth watering. P.s., ask for Haley-- she's the greatest!
