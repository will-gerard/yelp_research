We went back three Sundays in a row just so I could try more of that wonderful bruschetta. That's not overboard is it? Yanno when you eat something so good you want it again and again until you can get it out of your head? That was me with this bruschetta. The white sangria was the perfect addition. All enjoyed on their magical patio that's not too hot even at 100+ degrees. *sigh* ... ok, someone tell me four weeks in a row is not stalker levels? Can you stalk a restaurant?

Excellent service, classy (at least, that's how my parents/grandparents even would describe it), classic food done well. Even from the delicious bread and butter start, you know they've got it figured out. This place knows what it is and does it well. The lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs are solid choices.

I have started to go out of my way to shop here. The produce is consistently some of the best around, the deli meats are quality, and the meat case is inspiring. I bought a pack of pork spare ribs the other day and decided to try my first barbeque with my new grill - wood chips, smoke and all. See what I mean?  So good!

Our wedding here last year was beautiful. The moment we arrived I knew this was the place for us. It reminded me of back home in the Midwest with the trees and grass, and was the perfect outdoor location for our romantic wedding. I wish I'd found it sooner. But we'll look forward to going back to visit for our anniversary.   After our tour, we had breakfast on the property - fresh eggs and lemonade, sunlight streaming down. What a happy memory!  We also had a laid-back fun rehearsal lunch catered at the picnic tables that was delicious and picturesque.

Went for my second time this weekend, but not because the first time was good and I wanted to go back - someone else chose.   The first time I had the ramen and it wasn't very good. I remember having left sort of let down and still hungry because I didn't want to finish what I ordered. This time I went with sushi. I got the dragon roll, spicy tuna and eel w/avocado. I'm no sushi expert, but I wasn't terribly impressed. The dragon roll was the best of the three, mostly because it was large and fried. It was all just alright. I've had better.

This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, even though I don't get over here as often as I'd like.   First of all, the interior is stunning. I love coming here when the weather is nice enough that the opened windows let in fresh air and crisp white light that fills the place. I've never been for dinner but that will have to be next.  The first thing I ever tasted here had me trying to recreate its magic at home - a basil chicken sandwich: a large grilled chicken breast on fresh crusty bread smothered in brie aioli, basil and mushrooms. Their fries - truffle parmesan and otherwise, with tasty unique dips - are addicting. The zinc burger, mac and cheese, hanger steak are all very good. I loved the haricot verts and shitakes and ate the whole plate myself.   However, the best thing I've had here, which is in the top things I've ever eaten in my life I'm so enamored with it,... is the dungeness crab crepe. If you like crab (which you should if you have a tongue) you have to try this and savor every little bite.   I am a fan! Please continue making deliciousness forever.

This place made me sangry (sad + angry). I really wanted to like it as an Italian who works right around the corner.   Went here with my work team for lunch on a Friday and the service was so slow I missed my regular after-lunch meeting with my boss. Not cool! Not only did the food take forever to come out, paying the bill felt like it took just as long as eating. As we were wrapping up, I let the waitress know we were in a hurry, but it was at least 10 minutes until we got our check. I walked up to the counter area to ask her about it, and it was clear there was some confusion about our bill and what we ordered. Probably because one in our party was served well before everyone else (probably someone else's pasta), one who ordered chicken for her pasta never got it, and other general poor service related issues. She asked me to sit back down and said she'd bring it out to us, so I sat for countless minutes more until I eventually went up to her again only to have her tell me she thought she'd dropped it off already and had it in her apron pocket. OMG was I seeing red by that time.   If the food had at least been good, I might have been in a better mood,... but out of the six of us not ONE of us enjoyed the meal. The food was mediocre - like my reheated manicotti that seemed like a frozen Marie Callender's someone heated in the microwave. The garlic bread was rock hard and only edible after soaking it in red sauce for a few minutes to soften it out of desperation because the rest of our food was terrible.  Looking back at the reviews, perhaps sandwiches to-go might be alright, but I would never repeat our pasta eat-in experience ever again.

Went for cosmic bowling last week and had fun despite how bad this place was. I would never go back here. Avoid this place.  Yes, they had balls, lanes and pins. I suppose if you really like bowling and don't have any of your five senses, you would be fine... but then you really shouldn't be bowling anyway! yikes! ;-)   Let's start at the beginning... slow staff at the registers (fun tip: three people up there and only one working always pisses off a line of waiting customers)... on to the darkest cosmic bowling I've ever seen where our scores dropped in half from when we started with the lights on to when cosmic kicked in and we could no longer see the lanes (it was not cool, it was almost too difficult to be fun unless you only hit 3 pins on average in which case you won't see a difference)... through the schizophrenic music playlist going from hip hop to country to dubstep all in succession throttling our brains like some misguided scientific experiment... to the worst part of ALL which was the self promoting commercials interrupting every three songs at a LOUDER volume than the songs themselves. It was like being stuck in a TV without Tivo and it was horrible AND awkward. Stop trying to hawk popcorn so hard! I'm not paying to get commercials all night. It was appalling.

Fresh Wasabi was a great experience I hope to go back to soon. The atmosphere and food were a delight.  The interior is dark and hip - they even played good music - but still Japanese inspired, which is refreshing when so many places for sushi around the valley seem to be one or the other.   The food was quality in its preparation and imagination. For example, even the miso soup, which is usually a throw-away for me, was delicious. I believe they added some kind of mushroom, that gave the soup nice depth. What a surprise! The sushi itself was excellent, if a little adventurous. Based on other reviews, I got the spicy tuna. It was definitely good quality with a texture that maintained the integrity of the fish, and an interesting spiciness that isn't your typical paste mixed with the fish into a soft blob.   And so my parting words to you regarding this gem aren't "soft blob",...  fresh fish, inventive, chic! don't miss out

The food keeps me coming back again and again. The New York roll is my favorite - spicy tuna topped with the butteriest avocado, eel sauce and crunch tempura flakes. One of our party got the sashimi boat and the cuts were thick and fresh. Even the chicken teriyaki is quite tasty.   That said, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that 1) the place often appears a bit understaffed and not as quick as I'd like and 2) the rolls can be small.   Happy hour is 8PM to close, so if you want to fill up for the cost, go then.

I've been here twice now for special occasions to lounge by the pool and get a massage and left relaxed and rejuvenated both times. Most recently my mom and I went for their summer special $50 off a 60 minute treatment. My mom had never had a massage before - her face afterward was priceless accompanied by her "I've never been so relaxed" commentary. It was well worth it.

I typically employ a "generalist" strategy when eating out, trying something new each time, unlike my husband the "specialist' who will find one thing he likes and never waver. Defalco's meatball sub forces me to break my pattern. It's so good I've never tried anything else here! Last Valentine's day, we celebrated the weekend before and on our way to our outside-of-town date activities, we stopped by Defalco's for meatball subs! Red meat, cheese and tomato sauce spells romance for me apparently.   You can eat-in amid the grocery shelves, but we generally take it to-go.

As far as Irish pubs go, Rula Bula is spot on for me. It doesn't feel cheap and sticky like other so-called Irish pubs around here and I've never felt it was a bad choice. Drinks and a night out, mid-day for lunch, mid-week for dinner, trivia, live music... yes!   I truly love the fish & chips, but I've also enjoyed their burgers, Dublin chicken & Farmhouse chicken sandwiches, Shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie, St. Peter's Fish & the Gaelic-style chicken breast which is my go-to. The food is substantial and delicious.   I always walk out thinking I need to go back asap. :-)

Two words: bone marrow. :-)   My husband and I went for dinner when we were "up". lol! We were feeling adventurous and decided to try the bone marrow appetizer to start which we'd never had before. I don't have anything to compare it to, but it was certainly a memorable experience and quite tasty.   Then we had some wine. Then some entrees which I can't recall very well after the wine. We left happy. Isn't that the story of a good night in Vegas or what?   The place was beautiful as well and makes me want to remodel my kitchen. Very romantic at night in the dim lighting. If only I could eat like that every night (or at least pretend at a nice marble table of my own).

Came here specifically in search of a good lobster tail and wasn't disappointed, but the highlight was my husband's steak au poivre with cracked black peppercorn cognac sauce! It was the best steak au poivre either of us have ever tasted, which is my husband's favorite we get all over town so we're becoming experts. I believe we also tried the truffled mac and cheese and a spicy ahi tuna roll which were very good!   I would eat this stuff every day if it didn't cost an arm and a leg. We'll definitely be back.

My husband and I got married on the Farm and came back to eat at Quiessence for our anniversary. It was slow (Tuesday night) where although there's not much for the servers to do, you sort of expect them not to push it because there's really no show that night, but they were top-notch. They even brought us celebratory champagne and dessert with a happy anniversary message.  The best part was that the food was pretty amazing. I had the halibut in brown butter tarragon sauce with heirloom cauliflower that was the most scrumptious vegetable I've eaten in a long time - maybe ever. Delicious!   We'll be back!

Sandwiches aren't exactly gourmet, but this place certainly tries! I love their Vermonter which is delicious and unique - turkey, ham, cranberry mayo, cheddar and granny smith apples! The egg salad sandwich is also a bit of heaven. And their soups...! Everything was super fresh.   To top it off, I ordered online and when I walked in and got to the front of the line, the man correctly guessed that I was the one who called in an order for an egg salad sandwich! Maybe I paused when he expected an order, or was eyeing the boxed up order on the counter, but I'd like to think it's just another bit of magic - just like the food!

Each visit to Chloe's makes me happy. The space recalls an urban deli yet is spacious, cheery and sun-drenched like all the best of Arizona. I almost always get the grilled cheese and tomato soup even when it's 100 degrees outside, and never regret it. The grilled cheese is comfort food at it's best with lots of gooey cheese on fresh buttered grilled bread, and the tomato soup is the best anywhere - just the right acidity and balance of light and heavy.

I've never been in, but our team at work often gets these for birthdays. They are so large, we typically split them in half so everyone gets to try two different flavor. I've tried the cinnamon sugar, chocolate, red velvet, spice, ... The tops are so big and frosted they fall over on a plate from being so top heavy. They are definitely the best cupcakes I've ever had. Mmmmmmmm!

Stopped in to grab a quick bite to-go on the way to the movies (spoiler alert - yes, i shoved the full bag of food into my purse and yes I am slightly ashamed yet slightly proud I pulled it off). I needed something fast that I could eat with my hands, that wouldn't make a ton of noise as I ate it. ;-) Having read the yelp reviews, I went with the gyro and wasn't disappointed.   Solid gyro that I wouldn't hesitate to get again - tasty sauce, tender juicy meat, soft fluffy pita, not geasy. It melts in your mouth - a statement generally not applied to meat sandwich type foods! My fiance thinks it might be the best he's ever eaten. Fries were just ok.   We just moved to the area, so I'm sure this will make it into my mental file of places to frequent. Plus being from Chicago, I'm a sucker for these types of places.

Great place, caring and knowledgeable staff. We moved a half hour north, but will continue taking our pet to University Animal Hospital.  We have been trying to figure out what is wrong with our cat, and they have gone above & beyond not just in exploring/treating my pet, but in demonstrating an understanding that some of these tests come at a hefty expense - always letting us know up front what the costs would be. We even had to get our cat x-rays, and when the films came back inconclusive and we were discussing next steps, the doc offered to try for one more at a different angle. Sure enough, we got a more conclusive result that helped us avoid going down the wrong path with further painful and expensive testing.

I've eaten here a handful of times but most recently just this weekend, and felt compelled to review.   The first time eating here I got a pretty simple pasta dish, and while it was done well I felt I could have made it at home. I only went back again because I was nearby and wanted to give it another try. The second time, I got sucked in trying a bite of what my fiance got - the lasagna bolognese. My veggie sandwhich was not doing it for me - the bread was extra crusty and dense, and the veggies were extra soft and not very flavorful. His lasagna, however, was excellent - so excellent that I had to go back for a full plate of it myself this weekend. It's a bit expensive for the size but the quality here really shines. Fresh basil on top and cooked within, quality parmagiano generously sprinkled along the edge of the plate, flavorful meat sauce.... and the cheese! It's not difficult to make a lasagna that "people" would like; it's melty meat and cheese after all! But this place puts in quality ricotta in a thick layer that you can sink your fork into. I take my time eating it, and don't feel ashamed or too heavy afterward.  I also had the cream of asparagus soup. Not many places have that on their menu so I ordered it on a bit of a lark really. I'm not a particular fan of asparagus or this kind of soup, but OMG it was spectacular. The balance of asparagus and cream was perfect.  The prices seem a bit too high, even considering the good quality of their dishes. I will keep going back, despite the prices, and hope I find more gems on their menu.

Orange roll, mido roll! This place has the greatest sushi for the money I've had in town. The mido roll is my favorite roll ever. I'm not the most experienced sushi eater, but I've had enough now to tell quality for the money, and this place delivers. Like another reviewer said as well, I too drive 40 minutes one way just to get there. Maybe Mido needs to start a caravan service or start another location farther north? :-)

Went for the all-you-can-eat crab legs at the end of the summer and ate all I could. It's all a blur now - as it was the moment I used the wet nap. The crab was acceptable because I'm a sucker for the little guys, but if you're at all picky you should run away. They had nothing else worth eating for the poor non-crab eater I went with. Leave those fools at home. If I'm hard up again I'd go back no problem.

Too cool for school! You wouldn't know it from the street, but there's a really sleek restaurant inside that adds another respectability notch to this town for me. Dark but cozy in a modern way. The food was good as well. We shared the large bolognese and a sausage/sage pizza. It was just right to fill us up. The menu looked so good, I remember as I was reading thinking to myself, I sure hope the food's as good as the decor so I can come back and try everything on this menu.

Pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was! The decor is typical. The staff was friendly. The chips come with two different salsas to start the meal. I had the number 31 which is like a quesadilla with a thin pork cutlet hidden within. The tortilla was crisped just right- the cheese was the good white melty mexican stuff that's not too greasy, and the pork was the right thickness and not overcooked. It was so simple but so good. I'd eat it again and again and I just may.

All I hoped for and more!   I'm from the Chicago suburbs and was basically raised on hot-dogs (I hit up Portillo's whenever I go home) and Lobby's hot dog combo really hit the spot for me. I'm not a fan of the smokey links you can get at Ted's, or the thin buttery "bun" of the Dog House - just not my ideal. (....honestly, my favorite hot dog is a plain Nathan's roasted over a campfire... :-O )  Lobby's dogs aren't steamed and the casing isn't thick like the Chicago dogs I'm used to, but instead of taking away from the authenticity, I would call this an upgrade! I like the texture of a grilled dog better - less rubbery more meaty. The overall effect is tasty and juicy! Add fresh condiments, a spotlessly clean and cheery space, friendly staff and, although this part might not be authentic either I find it to be another upgrade... you don't leave there reeking of fried grease from every pore!   Sounds from the reviews like I'll have to go back to try the Italian Beef if I can resist getting the hot dog again. May have to get both... :-)

Good quality dogs, ANY way you like them. I bet you couldn't think of a topping they couldn't do.OK, maybe you can you weirdo,...but that's your business! Try the super cute condiment bar's extra fixins. The menu has very creative options - dogs of all kinds! I can't bring myself to try something out of the box and just go with the standard - my first true hot dog love - but it satisfies every time, especially here.

Ummm... I don't know where to start. We went for a birthday dinner party on a Friday night and the only good(?) thing I can say is that this place like to "party". The music was bumpin at barely 8:30pm. Trivia, poker, name that tune... Too bad the food sucks, service sucks, and the clientele are straight out of a b movie. Someone had a puppet. ... not joking.   After letting our server know our large group needed more time deciding what to order, we were left alone for an eternity before we had to ask another server to go find ours so we could order. I tried to order something relatively safe in their "big salad". How bad can you screw up a salad? The lettuce was not fresh, the chicken on top was dried out, and it wasn't even "big" as was promised.   You couldn't pay me to step foot in this place again. The dj did get our relatively conservative birthday boy to do a body shot on the bar with his wife though, so 10 points for him!

I've gone twice - the weekend they opened and then the next weekend. I had to stop myself from going a third time because I could sense a snowball effect happening (both the fear I might start living there and the fear of becoming rounder and rounder in the mid section).   Went to Japan last year and fell in love with kyushu/hakata ramen. Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe's is closer to what I had in Tokyo (though only half as good), but this was still very good. Got the Republic ramen which came as a nice big helping, piping hot. The noodles were done perfectly - not overdone. The pork the first time was super! I could taste the ginger and the pieces were large and lean. The second time I was disappointed in the pork - it was a smaller portion, fattier, and less taste. I did fear they pulled out the big guns for opening weekend and won't be the same from then on. Guess I'll have to go a third time to get a good average.   I agree with others on here - skip the gyoza. I'm a huge fan of gyoza when done right, but these were greasy and thick with no dipping sauce if I'm remembering correctly.   Oh - and yes, the look is modern but the benches have a bit of an unfinished edge. I thought I was going to get a splinter. Look out for this or opt for the high top seating.

I agree with all of the good things already said by other reviewers, and so will you. I was a first-timer during Yelp Eats and got to try a variety of the best dishes... teeter tots (delicious fried morsels in just the perfect sauce), yellowtail sashimi (omg the flavor combination and freshness!), pork belly steamed buns (the table had to order seconds), soft shell crab sandwich (very good). It was the kind of meal I felt privileged to enjoy.

Silly name, friendly staff, small interior, generous portion, fresh flavorful ingredients, good value for the money. I had the Gordon's Wrap off the to-go menu - seasoned chicken (thigh?), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, potato salad wrapped in a tortilla. It came out within a few minutes. Only downside was that it was a bit messy and falling apart with all that goodness contained by a thin tortilla, but quite tasty! I couldn't imagine staying for a sit-down meal because as others have mentioned it feels more like a carry-out place, but I may have to try it next time. Oh, and they have signs up saying they are addressing concerns about the wait times for orders which I think shows they care. Good for them -hope it works.

A coworker went here and raved about the lamb, so I had to try it. I must not have had the same lamb because I ate about half out of hunger and then when the waitress asked if I wanted the rest boxed up I said no and she made this face: :-(  The atmosphere inside was very strange to me as well. It was a very large ornate space with large tables/booths yet it still felt cheap. The live band in the other room I had to climb over on my way to the bathroom was an interesting touch, but again I couldn't tell if it was fancy or cheap. It kinda reminded me of Vegas in that way.

Went for weekday lunch on a Friday and there was a small wait so we opted for the communal tables. Slight snafu when our waitress didn't realize our party was three and not the five that all sat down around the same time, and she started taking someone else's order with ours, but it was easily sorted out. The communal tables are a bit too wide across so you have to speak up to talk across them, but I'd sit there again.   Overall I was impressed with the look and feel of the place - there's a very "natural" vibe carried through the decor and open air/sunlight that enhances the food.   The food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent. To drink we all got the honey lemonade which was so simple but really excellent and comes with a free refill. I'd go back just for that! My companions enjoyed their open-faced salmon and the shaved turkey pita which each came with a side of mixed kale/sweet potato hash. I had the chicken panang curry which was tasty with fresh ingredients and well cooked, but I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of sauce to rice seems off and too soupy.   My companions had tried the salads on previous visits and thought they were much too small for the money. For the price, I thought we got our money's worth.

My husband and I ate here last weekend for a special night out, but I was let down.   It usually really bothers me when people complain about the service at nice places not being immaculate because no one's perfect. I generally avoid such complaints and focus on the food. This is going to be an exception to the rule.   It all started with the BUG in my husband's water! A dead floating little bug! I expect better at a place like this on a nice night out. When we told the waiter, he simply whisked the glass away, softly stating he'd bring him right out a new glass. No apologies, no acknowledgement that anything was out of the ordinary... is this how nice places handle mistakes of this nature? Just fix it and don't dwell? I can appreciate a quick fix of such a disturbing issue, but we were put off by how it was handled. On top of it, we definitely felt neglected from that point forward. The waiter for the tables around us spent time with his tables going over the options in a friendly manner... Maybe after the bug he figured he wasn't going to be able to recover a good tip so why bother with us? It was very awkward.   Overall, the food was pretty good. The tuna tartare was OK, but not amazing. I had the Nantucket Bay scallop special feature in part because the combination mentioned on the website's menu page intrigued me - scallops, brown butter, almonds and grapes with chives. What they actually brought out had tomatoes instead of grapes and no chives. It was still quite tasty, but left me feeling a bit deceived and wondering what I was missing. We also got the crab fried rice everyone raves about here, but it was shocked at how spicy it was when it said nothing about this on the menu. It was OK, but  I couldn't taste the crab at all because of the spice, which was disappointing because I love crab. Also, the Asian flavors were out of place in combination with my meal, and I had wished the waiter would have counseled us on our choices a bit more. My husband got the steak au poivre that we loved at Wildfish. I wasn't impressed this time, but he still enjoyed it. The bananas foster dessert was spectacular though - don't miss it!  After these issues, this place will not be on my list of places to return, which is a shame because I work 1 minute away. :-(

The "chicken burger" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich.

I hate these kinds of places where you have to pick out your own food and flavors, but against my better judgement I went anyway. I should have listened to my gut and found something better around the corner. Of course my food was TERRIBLE and instead of being able to be upset with the chef, I had only myself to blame.   I could have made my own terrible pedestrian stir fry at home!

I cannot speak highly enough of Andrew and Emily, so it's a good thing I don't have to since our pictures do it for us. They are not only highly skilled photographers, they are genuine people.   Out of the madness of the Phoenix Bridal Expo, I'm so grateful to have wandered across their booth. I knew photography was one of the most important pieces to me for the wedding, and never though it would be the first thing I could check off my list. From the minute I saw their work and began to talk about their approach, I knew we were a match. Check out their blog! (I did from my Droid during the fashion show just after meeting them! ... I wasn't going to win the "dance" contest anyway... ;-) )  I don't consider myself naturally photogenic and poised, and knew if I was up in my head the pictures wouldn't do justice to all of the hard work I'd put in for 9 months. Andrew and Emily were able to put us at ease the whole time and help bring out our best.  If you are looking for photography that truly captures the spirit of your wedding, they're it. They understand the moments that make a wedding special, and capture them beautifully.

I'm a fan. The food I've tried was excellent, the space is very pretty and nothing beats open air upscale mexican when it's this nice out in AZ. I've seen minor hiccups in service both times - forgetting to bring out something I ordered on the first visit, not bringing out the tostadas and dips when we sat down the second time, incorrectly bringing out tacos when we ordered a burrito. To be fair, they were very apologetic and friendly (and new!) so I barely thought twice about it.   I went two days in a row last week, trying the sol and spicy/tropical ceviche. Both had great quality, though for less than a dollar more, the spicy/tropical is the way to go. It's beautiful, fresh, flavorful. So fun! The sol is a small for the price.  I also had the Ensenada fish tacos, which were small but had great taste. Some of the best flavor outside Ensenada itself. I wish they put the lime sauce on the top vs. underneath where the moisture and heat makes the breading soggy. Lastly, I had the Bufalada taco which was surprisingly hearty and had great flavor from the tortilla to the meat, cheese and guacamole on top!  I wish they had a happy hour since I work so close by! I'll definitely be back.

What a fun experience on top of some seriously yummy eats! I love the tubs of bottled drinks flanking the line, the condiments, the meat scales! They let you taste a bit before ordering like they do at Chino Bandito and I have to say - I really respect a place that confident! Went with friends and got to taste a bit of everything else - pork ribs, brisket, jalapeno sausage... creamed corn, potato salad, coleslaw, new potatoes. I really loved the creamed corn and potato salad. The pork ribs were my main dish, and I cleaned the bone. These were seasoned during smoking, not glazed like I'd have preferred, but still delicious with my choice of bbq sauce from their array of offerings. We left a mess across their wide picnic table seating and didn't feel bad about it. :-)

Loved every bite. You need to come here... support this business because I want to see it stick around! You will only need to take this advice once.  First, we got the pot stickers which the gentleman said we're home made - they certainly tasted fresh. Generous portions of juicy pork in a wrapper just the right thickness to hold it all in.  Next, the "lightly fried" orange chicken seemed boring but safe (that one was the husband's choice). I was still expecting a thick breading because I feel that I've fallen for this before and been disappointed. My expectations were low. However, I can honestly say it was the best version of this dish I've had. More chicken than breading? Finally! A sauce that isn't goopy but still coats each piece generously!  Lastly, the Singapore chow fun noodle... First time/long time... First time having this dish, though I've seen it on menus and considered it many times before. Again, I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the ingredients stood out in a way I wasn't expecting for the price. I loved each one - the delicate noodles, the fresh and not over cooked shrimp, the small pieces of pork which were plenty and just the right size for the noodle. No piece cooked poorly, and each coming together to form and flavor the dish - it didn't feel thrown together to try to pass itself off as a dish like similar dishes elsewhere.   This will be our new go-to spot for Chinese in the area.  The price were great too for the quality and size. I think they could charge slightly more except,... I hate to say anything negative because I want people to come eat here... But there is one negative I can think to mention which is the decor/ambiance. We took it carry out as planned before we went in, but I didn't care for the inside. It seemed like it was trying for an upscale look with poor quality materials. Dark colors and a bit tacky paint job, TVs on the wall felt cheapening. It's a shame, but I am happy to carry out my Chinese.

The space is laid out a little weird,  but the Caesar salad and the square slice of pizza were delicious beyond expectation specially for $5 total. I will definitely try to come back here and recommend you try it too. And they were very friendly and fast with the check and the food.

My first and only bahn mi experience so far, but I really enjoyed it and have been back three times and always get the same thing - the lemongrass pork bahn mi. The cashier recommended it when I asked what to get, saying it was his favorite, and I've never looked back. Very fresh and tasty. Also, they have a few tiny tables out front so I can bring my pup with. They always offer me a bowl of water to give her. Very thoughtful.

This review is of my experience scheduling only - I never got my massage.   I bought a Groupon for this company after comparing the many massage options on Groupon and seeing good reviews on Yelp for them.   I called the same day I bought the Groupon to schedule my massage. The company had very limited availability, especially for the most desirable times (non-work hours, weekends). The soonest weekend appointment was seven weeks out. I assume this happens occasionally when companies sell more Groupons than they can handle. I took the appointment in seven weeks and waited patiently.   Finally, my weekend was here! I scheduled my other weekend activities around my massage and was looking forward to it...  This morning, the company calls me to tell me they have to cancel on me because the therapist is going out of town.   Now, I don't know why they are going out of town... Perhaps something terrible happened and they have to go and I should be compassionate...  However, my compassion starts to fade when I am told that the next available weekend appointment is another two months away.   I am not going to wait four months for a massage! If you, the business, cancel on someone last minute, you should be willing to offer them SOMETHING  to compensate. Not "I'm sorry let's pretend this didn't happen and you weren't already waiting for months".   Very poor customer experience. I was no longer comfortable putting myself (literally) in this company's hands. I canceled this Groupon and will find somewhere else to take my business.

This was some of the worst sushi I've ever had, especially for the money. I could barely get it down. The place is dumpy and depressing inside. All around terrible.

First time having this cuisine, and I was impressed. I love sushi, so this was right up my alley. Pretty fresh, and great price compared to sushi. I got the half rice half salad regular, with spicy tuna and salmon. I love that combo in sushi rolls, and loved it here too. Yum!
