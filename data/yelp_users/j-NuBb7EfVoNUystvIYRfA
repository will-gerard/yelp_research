I came to this business to take advantage of their alterations and sewing. Given there is no military base nearby it's always a struggle to find a business that can provide the precision that is needed for military regulations. The owner followed my instructions perfectly, measuring and marking the locations for rank and service stripes on dress blues and the sewing of name tapes, rank and badges on 2 sets of ACUs. Job well done.

This place is a super old school and family run. The sandwiches are all made fresh. The cheese steak with the homemade sauce is the best I have had in Scottsdale. Its a pain that they are cash only but I'll save my dollars specifically to come here. In the words of the Terminator.. "I'll be back"

Nothing makes me happier than to see that this terrible establishment has finally closed!! This review is about a year after the fact, but what the heck.. America's Taco Shop was responsible for one of the worst 72hr periods of my life. I made the mistake of eating here after class and became deathly ill. So sick in fact that I was taken to the hospital and treated for "Staph Food Poisoning" which specifically comes from food that has been allowed to gather bacteria in an unsanitary kitchen environment and from food that is being kept well below the required temperatures.15lbs of vomit and $1000s later i was released back society. Considering this shit shack has now become a local chain I will take any means necessary to avoid their toxic food and meal preparation practices. Unless you want to see exactly how much vomit can come from your body... i suggest you do the same.

I have been working out here for the past 2 years. The gym is large, the equipment is well maintained. They have a TON of machines, and not that much room for free weights. Only 2 squat racks and no basketball court. Otherwise the gym has everything I need. The crowds don't get too insane. Very happy with my membership here.

Honestly did not know this place existed until I found it on Yelp. Based on the other reviews I figured I would give it a try and was not disappointed. I came here for lunch and ordered the pulled pork and potato salad to go. The portion size was huge and the spicy bbq sauce is the TRUTH. I was more than full and happy after eating here. I will be returning to try their ribs.

I was introduced to Taylor by some mutual friends. I had just returned to Arizona from a deployment in Afghanistan and was looking to get into a house fairly quickly. When I met with Taylor I was very impressed by his professionalism and knowledge for being such a young guy. He was very easy to communicate with. He answered any text or email very quickly and made the whole process of finding a home surprisingly easy. Taylor was a pleasure to work with, I will do so again when the time comes.

Hands down the most expensive evening of bowling I have EVER had the misfortune to be a part of. Steer clear of this place. Nothing special about the alley, bar or staff here. My girlfriend and I were here for around 2 hours with a group of 8. With the end bill being well over $400 we were all left scratching our heads in disbelief. I will NEVER return to this horrible business.
