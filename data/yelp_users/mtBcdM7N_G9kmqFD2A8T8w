First off my husband and I went to dinner here on a Thursday night. When we entered there was an awkward wait for a table.  One employee left to check on something, while the other three stood there cheating with each other. As we were finally seated, we noticed the place was not busy wondering why the wait to be seated.  The gentlemen who sat us fumbled with the three different menus. Again a little odd. Our waitress came and talked us through the menu. After our order, our waitress was hardly seen.  There we long waits between each course.  We would have rather gotten our food more quickly.  The gentlemen who dropped off the broth pot was awkward too and didn't way hi or anything to us. It was just as bad when he picked up the pot.  Food was mediocre, it lacked flavor even with the dipping sauces.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, it is hard to mess up chocolate.    During our meal a gentlemen who looked like the manager walked by twice. Not once did he check in with us to see how we are doing.    At the end of the night it too a long time to get our check.  At least I was able to get the check in offer - a bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. Which is pretty good, just wish they would have incorporated it into the food instead of using it as a "salt".

Called a few Best Buy's for availability of the new IPhone. This store was out of stock but was nice enough to see availability at other stores! I didn't need to call anymore stores because they went the extra mile to help me out!

Food wasn't so bad, but service wasn't great. We sat down waited about 10min for a sever. We ordered drinks and it took forever to get our drinks out. Once they came we order and our food came out immediately. During our dinner our drinks ran out and our sever didn't check back on us for drinks.  Our kids were thirsty and we had to wait and wait. Finally our sever came we ordered another round of drinks and it took 20min to get our order. We actually walked up to the bar and noticed our server hadn't picked up our drinks which were ready. Once we got the check it took even longer for them to pick up our check so we could high tail it out of here.

Granted it has been awhile since  we have been to half moon. Since we have been there they have done some changes and not for the better.  My husband and I ordered grilled wings, personal pizza and a side salad. The salad was the best out of all three.  The wings weren't grilled and the pizza had an off flavor and taste. The crust had some sort of weird seasoning. It was so bad, we didn't even finish the whole "small" pizza. To top it off the margarita I order, while huge, lacked alcohol. Being we went there on a Saturday during prime NCAA football season it sure was quiet. Sadly a place we use to enjoy is no longer on our list to attend!

These guys were awesome! They were polite , professional and worked their butts off. The only downside is they broke a light cover.  They were honest about the light and gave us a credit to get it fixed. If you want a mover who cares and is professional, go with Camelback Movers!

Had a great experience! Amy is amazing. This is the 2nd time I have had my hair done with her and will continue from now on. I has highlights, hair cut, style and brows waxed. She listened to my needs and gave me suggestions for my color.  Which turned out great! The best part of the day was the eye brow consultation. She showed me where brows should start and end as well as where the arch begins. I have been getting brows done for years and never been taught how to shape them. I found this very rare. Amy not only does a great job she also wants to educate her clients!

Great place, especially for the 80's kids. Played great music and brought me back to high school! Food is great as well. So why a four? I ordered no cheese and my order came out with cheese. HOWEVER, the waitress was great and took care of it!!! Now listening to Madonna!! Oh ya!

I was very unhappy with my hair cut and color from The Pampered Pinkie.  I did my research on yelp before choosing a hair salon and came a crossed The Pampered Pinkie.  I read the reviews, looked at the details and I was excited to see all 5 star reviews.  I especially choose The Pampered Pinkie because one review was of someone who felt so comfortable.  This was the exact opposite of my experience.  When I got there I met my stylists and told her I wanted to go lighter and blonder.  She stated, given the time frame I was scheduled, 2 hours, she was not going to be able to meet my request as it is a process to get blonde hair.  I had some re-growth of dark hair which makes going lighter more difficult so she suggested adding highlights to lighten up my hair and to make it look natural.  I trusted her and off we went.  Throughout the entire appointment she did not interact with me nor ask me any questions making me feel uncomfortable.  After the color had set we went to the sink to rinse out the color and add toner.  I have had my hair done before with toner and usually they leave it in for 10-15min.  She put it into my hair and massaged it in for only 5min, definitely not long enough to truly get the copper out of the highlights.  We went back to the chair and she proceeded to cut my hair without asking exactly what I wanted for my cut.  I realized shortly afterwards all the rush was due to her next appointment had arrived.  She quickly dried my hair, leaving parts of my hair still wet.  She asked what I thought about the color and I told her there was a lot of variation to the highlights.  She said it was due to my original highlights and you will always have variation.  I found this interesting when my re-growth section of my hair is what varied the most, not my old highlights.  She did not seem to care I was unhappy with the color, nor offered any suggestions on fixing it.  So I left completely dissatisfied and I couldn't have felt less pampered!

Feeling pampered!  The Pampered Pinkie went above and beyond to fix my hair from my previous appointment.  My stylist brought me into the salon after hours to dedicate her time to recolor and cut my hair.  We had a great consultation making sure we had a plan in place to get my hair to the color I desired.  She engaged in conversation with me throughout the entire appointment, including the wait time of the foils.   She took extra care when applying the toner and even gave me a hair mask to hydrate my hair.  She finished by cutting and styling my hair just the way I like it!  I LOVE the new color of my hair and know the Pampered Pinkie truly cares about their clientele.  One recommendation to those who are trying this salon for the first time, make sure the receptionist knows the length and color of your hair as well as the look you want to achieve from your appointment.  This way they can schedule the appropriate time frame for your appointment and give you and your hair the attention it deserves.  I will definitely be coming back to The Pampered Pinkie!

L-O-V-E The Brickyard Downtown!  We've been looking for a great mixologist place and this is it. Tried several drinks; absolutely loved all of them!  They are creative and so different from your typical bars.  Totally recommend!!!
