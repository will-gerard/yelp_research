I frequently go to this location and love the experience here. The staff now knows my name and they are very friendly. The salad options are endless and they also have great cornbread. I love the variety in the soups as well.

This location provides excellent customer service. I have been here twice and both times I was in and out in less than 1 hour without an appointment. This time, I want to mention Jeffrey. He helped me, but I also watched him help many others. He saw someone getting anxious about the time and rather than wait for her to approach  him; he approached her. He asked her if she was in a hurry and helped to ease her concern about it getting finished promptly. He then worked with the techs to make that happen. Later he was so patient when a deaf woman came in and had to write out her requests. He never once lost his patience explaining his responses several times in writing. A true class act.    Bonus, they support two of my favorite causes Leukemia & Lymphoma and Girls on the run.

Great place for kids and adults! I have been several times as a volunteer on First Friday (which is free) with the Junior League of Phoenix. The great part is there really are no rules for kids so they can explore as they want to and discover new cool things.  I have also attended the adult events on Halloween and the Gala. All top notch well planned events!

My dogs love going here! I love that the staff knows both my dogs by name and seem to truly care about them. The groomer does a great job with their long hair! Great place.

I have visited/called 4 times all four a disaster under previous and new management. First I had a Mitsubishi lease, I dropped off my car for end of lease inspection. 6 hours later I go to pick it up it had not be done. They wanted to to look at new cars. I drop it off again 4 hours later no call I picked it up they said they had not gotten to it yet. I needed up dropping it at another dealer 1 hour later done, needed up buying a new car there.  Next time I call service department for tires for my Mitsubishi they transfer me to parts. I ask about tires he says what size, I saw I have no idea. His smart ass response well not sure why your talking to me they put four different sizes on those cars so once you know what you want let me know. And proceeds to tell me they are no longer Mitsubishi anyway. So rude and the attitude is horrible.  So I call the Manager Sam, and Start to tell him about my only 3 experiences with this place he interrupts me to ask why I am calling well to tell you  about your horrible service. Then he says we are under new management and have excellent customer service now. I disagreed. Then says not sure what you are tying to accomplish. When I told him I was doing a review and writing a letter I asked for his name 7 times and he refused to give it to me. I called back and got the manager on duties name. He never apologized.  Such an attitude this place no wonder.

I have been there three times all three times have been horrible. The first time they simply did not vacuum the back seat; just skipped it. I had tipped $15 and had to turn around and get it vacuumed as they talked about how there was dog hair in the back in Spanish and how gross it was. They also said in Spanish I better tip; Mind you I had just tipped $15.  The second time, I get on my car the seats in the back were not done at all. I go back around and there happens to be someone there and he says he is over this location and others and here to look at the vacuums specifically because there have been complaints. He looks at my car says it's horrible the vacuum job. I told him that I have been here twice and had horrible experiences with vacuum and customer service and will not be back. He begs me to give them another try. Months later, I decide to. It's 5:08 on a Sunday. I pull in the vacuum guy makes eye contact several times and looks to the oil change bay where MANY people are hanging out. One of the guys in the blue shirts sees me and runs inside to get a drink and continues to hang out. The vacuum guy pulls car in front of me up and disappears. Blue shirt comminuted to hang out talking; looks over 4 times. I assume they are closing or closed so back out and reverse. Never once does the blue shirt guy or any of the MANY people in the bay flag me down or try to stop me. I leave at 5:18 call and found out they are open till 6. Never again.

I have been her a couple of times after a groupon. Loved the classes. The instructors are very helpful and offer lots of instruction. The only downside for me is that I don't have time to regularly go and therefore when I go it's a couple of months in between and I forget what I learned. I wish it was closer.   I have created many cool pieces and feel like everyone there really cares about the students and helping them learn.

Hidden Gem!!!! I attended a fundraiser at the location last year and loved the interactive displays. Kids (and adults) can really learn! The cost is low and that helps for families on a tight budget. The exhibits have various interactive activities. Location is VERY clean!

One of my favorite places! Great food, great concept, great service 99.9% of the time. They do groupons all the time and it's only $5 for a ticket. I don't like junk food at other movies and they have good options for food. The seats are good, but I don't dig the rolling office chairs. But that's avoidable by getting there a little early.   Chocolate chip cookies are the best!

I have been here twice and really enjoyed learning about the process and leaving with 3 AMAZING pieces! The beginner classes are really fun and the guys are entertaining. They are very helpful and ensure you leave with a great piece. I have heard that if you do more classes you can actually learn more and do more of the work yourself.   The only downside I had was that I purchased my groupon online and when I went for the class it said I had picked the wrong class for the groupon. It was a little confusing online.   Would go back and bring people with me.

LOVE THIS PLACE! They are very fun and make the class entertaining. We had a great time drinking and painting. The instructors are very patient and clear in the instructions. I have done team builders with them and those are great bonding experiences as well.  But beyond that, they did a fundraiser for me for an event and EVERYONE had a great time! We made money for a great charity. They also donated to every auction that I have asked them to help with. Love a company that does a great job and GIVES BACK!

The person we saw (female) was very professional, she listens well. Has a great bedside manner and relates to patients and parents. My foster daughter (16) said she was "cool" and "understanding" she made her feel really comfortable. Really liked the quick service when the doctor asked for testing. The only downside was the wait time prior to seeing the doctor but I am happy to wait for a good doctor! Would see again.
