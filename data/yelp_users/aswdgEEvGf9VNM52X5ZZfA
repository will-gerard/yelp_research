One of the worst experiences we have had in Scottsdale. Went to pita house because they were featured in Local Dines. We had $30 to spend. As we ate our mediocre dinner the only thing they made it totable was the thought of getting a discount. The bill came (unlike half of my dinner) and they refused to honor the Local Dines coupon.  Needless to say we will not return and are letting you know to pick another place.

Good place for a vegetarian.  The veggie wrap was yummy.
