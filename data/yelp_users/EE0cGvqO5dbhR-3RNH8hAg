This review is solely based on service. Don't order online. We waited 50 minutes before calling to ask for a status only to find out they were just putting in the order and it would be another 45 minutes.   I cancelled the order.

Awesome service, professional and experienced. We've had our shutters and cellular shades for well over a year and couldn't be happier. Excellent product and Boyd is a pleasure to work with.

Pesto Chicken is amazing, add some artichoke too.   This place is an exciting new find! Look forward to many more visits.
