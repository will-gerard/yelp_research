You're better off going to a do it yourself wash. I bought their buy 4 get two free washes my first time. Big mistake. I can't wait to get through the these washes and be done with this place. $22 a wash and they will only "dry cloth" clean the inside of your car. That's a rip off. I wish I knew where there was a Danny's Carwash out here in Chandler. That's where I used to go and id be much happier tipping the employees for a job well done than out of sympathy.

Being new to the area I found this place through Yelp. Going through the reviews we took a chance and went. Glad we did! The food was good and the staff was so friendly, you felt right at home. The wait for the food is a while so only go if you have time to spare. We will be back to enjoy the food and the staff.

This place was god awful and such a waste of money. I asked for a Long Island ice tea which tasted like an overly spiked lemonade, so gross. When we took it back and the bartender said that he's made hundreds of theses and he knows what he's doing. Tip Mr. Bartender: Google a better recipe. Your drink was wack! He then gave us a beer in  place of his God awful drink and still charged us $9!!!! Wtf?! The music was bad and the games were not working right.  I won't ever go back.

I have taken both my boys here for almost 7 years now, they were still desert ridge pediatrics, and we still love it there. So much so, I am driving them down from Chandler/Gilbert because I don't want to switch them.  When I has my second son, he was so early that he had to go on a special formula. Knowing how expensive it was the office gave me weeks sometimes months worth each visit. You can't go wrong offering help like that in an economy like this.   Yes, sometimes the waits are long BUT there are times when you don't wait at all. They are a very popular office that takes care of their patients and if they need to spend a little extra time with someone's child, so be it. I would want the same if my child needed it.
