I've been in Metro Phoenix for 8 Yes, why did I not know about this place sooner?? Food is great, sliders...OMG, blindfold me and I would swear they were White Castles. I love all the memorabilia...well except for the White Sox stuff.  All kidding aside, really enjoyed our visit, food and conversations.

I finally found a veterinarian that really cares about the animals they treat.  I had to take my little dog in because of bad allergies and he had scratched his face so much it was bleeding.  The took such good care of him and talked to me about all the possibilities and wasn't just trying to rack up the bill with unnecessary tests.  He sent us home with a tube of cream and a 'lamp shade" to put around his face.  Then the doc called the next day to see how he was doing?  WHAT????  He called me to see how my dog is doing?  Unbelievable!  I took him back for a follow up and I'm happy to report he's doing very well and is back to his playful self.  Nice, friendly, professional staff...caring doctors.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  P.S.  Dr's are cute too!

This wasn't my first Sushi experience, but it was a pretty darn good one.  My son and his family met me there and filled me in on the "good stuff".  Like it so much went back the next day.  The Vegas Rolls ROCKED!  The service is spot on...right there to refill my drink, take dirty dishes etc.  Friendly staff, prices are not bad at all.  I will go back again and again.

Not that impressed.  Costs too much to wash the car, they didn't even vacuum the back and left streaks on the windows.  Won't be back.

Tried again and still not happy.  Streaks on windows...I can understand not going in to the backseat of the car, but I don't understand why they can't clean the console!  This is the last time....I gave it a second try and still disappointed.

So very disappointed tonight. This is a Chicago eatery / bar and yet the bartender would rather keep the volume on for the Patriot cheaters football than the Chicago Cubs vs NY Mets NLCS game. Horrible....Def won't be back to watch any Chicago sports here.  I guess they should change their name to any other team but Chicago.  PS. Food was OK, beer choices were mediocre considering the breweries in AZ. So disappointed in the place.

We stopped in on a whim and we were NOT disappointed.  The food was wonderful! Not like other restaurants that label themselves as Italian.  The food was delicious, the marinara amazing and the Stromboli was huge and full of cheese and ham and flavor!  The crust was baked to perfection.  My friend experienced the baked ziti and the Scilian style pizza.  However, the service was better the first time I was there; the second time we felt rushed and perhaps an inconvenience.  But that was secondary to the food.  We chalked that up her having a bad day.

I brought my son and grandkids for lunch and we were very disappointed.  Said the outside wasn't open yet; it was 1PM...the pizza and Stromboli's were burnt!  I don't think I will be back; maybe the first two times I went was the flook and this is the for real.

WOW!!!!!!!!!  This is one of the best "hole in the wall" diner/sports bars I've been to that was actually fun, great burger and the staff are all very friendly (a little slow), but friendly.  I was there with my son, grandson and cousin that was in town visiting.  We were all able to sit in the bar, watch the game (cards lost...no surprise there, but the bears won!), have a great meal and enjoy the ambiance.  I would recommend this to anyone, drinkers or non drinkers alike.  There is a condiment bar so you put on your burger whatever you want.  I enjoyed the Fiesta Burger and the guacamole was so tasty and fresh.  Awesome!

This is not a complaint against JUST this particular WalMart! Consumers beware! I believed their ads about cashing checks for $3 each. I went to WalMart to cash my payroll check (because my bank was closed and I need the $ to pay my rent). I put in my social security number and was refused. Of course they don't tell you why; I'm thinking it has to do with the company I work for. Turns out...WALMART will ONLY cash checks for people with superior credit. NOW, shouldn't they say that in their ads instead of wasting my time finding a place to park and then waiting in line as customer service just to be refused? I was humiliated!  What does MY credit have to do with cashing my payroll check????? I will NEVER step foot in WALMART again!

This place was HOPPING with business...having said that, we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes.  So, we stepped outside and before we could even light a cigarette; we were called in to be seated.  I'm a Hoosier and just had to check the place out.  I was not disappointed, good Mid West cooking, FRIENDLY waitstaff, hot food fast...delicious cup of coffee.  It's a little cramped in the dining area, but it was tolerable.  Good Food, Good Service, Good Prices...I'll be back

This is as good as it gets at a Service Station just shy of him coming out to fill the tank and wash my windows.  Always friendly, always kind, always helpful.  Coffee is always fresh, donuts and bfast foods always plentiful and fresh.  Nothing is ever stale or old smelling....The music outside isn't blaring in my ears and all and all a very pleasant experience.

This was my first time at a dog park, it was a really nice park.  However, I wish that more people were courteous dog park users and pick up the LOADS left by their animals.  I mean, these are BIG dog pies left by the dog/owner and it's not fun to have to constantly walk around them.  The park provides poop bags, so there is no excuse!   I especially appreciate the separate gated areas.  My 7lb pooch doesn't have to mingle with the 100lb dogs.  There is a lake there for the dogs that appreciate playing in water and it was entertaining to watch (man, i need a life).   My last two "complaints" are for the Gilbert parks dept. website and YELP (that's right..YELP) The park is NOT located on the Northeast corner of Ray and the San Tan Loop.  It's about 1/2 mile from the corner, so we did have some problems finding it.   Yelp, when I was sitting in the park I tried to check in and was told I was too far away.  UH, I was IN THE PARK!  How could I be too far away??????

This is a great place for coffee and wonderful pastries.  The Baristas are GORGEOUS young men and are so friendly, entertaining and helpful.  There is outdoor seating as well as a nice big indoor area.  The pastries are amazing and unlike Starbucks, you won't break the bank for a cup o'joe and a treat.  I dare ya to go and not enjoy the place...I double dog dare ya!

OMG what a cupcake!  It was a really great, fun and entertaining place to go.  The staff were super friendly and very very nice.  I know you're thinking, "it's just a freakin cupcake"...Not so...These cakes are amazing!  The flavors are not too over the top and the frosting is not too sweet.  I had the Belgian Chocolate and OHHHHHHHHH it was better than.....my sister had the strawberry cupcake and she couldn't get her face out of the wrapper.  My son had the chocolate, hazelnut and was moaning...a little disturbing, but I completely understood.  it's a bit of a drive for me, but I'll definately be back!

This place was suggested by a trusted friend...i wasn't disappointed in taste / quantity / quality, however I do think it was a little pricey.  I'll be back FOR SURE, but will spend a little less cash.

I am officially giving 20+ stars!  This is an awesome brewery and the food was amazing.  I had the street tacos (chicken, pork and beef); the flavor is wonderful.  Our server was Olympia and she was the best server I've had in any restaraunt since I've moved here.  She was engaging, friendly and knew her beer!  I had the Devil Ale and was very pleased...Bar none...best place / server in Chandler.  Also has lots of shopping and a winery down the street.  I can't wait to go back and bring other family and friends.

I wish I could give this more stars! My son brought me here for my birthday and all I can say is, I. AM. LOVED. we started with Lemon drop martinis, then one with fresh pureed strawberries. A-mazing. Then we had a bread basket, very nice selection. I ordered a filet my son ordered the chefs steak; a slightly larger portion. Both were Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. My son added frois gras butter to his I tried a bit on my mine and it was fabulous. We also shared lobster mash potatoes and saut√©ed sugar snap peas. Very nice, fresh flavor. They brought a slice of cake with whipped cream for my b-day and I was blown away at the freshness, creaminess and silky flavor. MINDBLOWN! I'll be back for sure....right after I win the lottery...tee hee.

If I could give 1/2 a star I would.  After walking up to the counter, the "Batista" never even acknowledged us. After waiting 15 minutes to finally get waited on, she still never said hi or I'm sorry for the wait. We placed our order which was 2 muffins warmed with butter, a reg coffee, a child sized drink and a medium drink. We paid the girl and she said she would bring it out to us. We went outside since there was no seating inside. About 15 - 20 minutes into our conversation we realized its taking a little too long.  My friend goes inside to see what the hold up is. The girl said she couldn't find us..bullshit, she never came outside... she couldn't remember what I ordered and forgot to warm the muffins. I went in to tell her my order and she never looked at me...she never apologized...nothing.  When I took the empty plates in I told another person behind the counter that tthis was my first time here...and my last.  The girl said in a very shitty tone, "Sorry to hear that, have a nice day". Haley was the name of the Barista and if she cannot look customers in the face and smile even when you're having a shit day...my advice to her is to find another job! One where you don't have to deal with the public. To the other person behind the counter with the shitty attitude....You Suck! You should find out why we were unhappy and do what you can to keep a customer.  I won't be back...and I will share my experience with EVERYONE!

If we had to do this over again we would.  We have had more problems with our phone system in the last year then we ever did with our other local company.  We love service constantly and we get no direct answers as to why.  We having been waiting for a month for a T1 card and have not heard from anyone.  I could go on and one about the problems we've had; suffice it say, this is not a company you want to do business with.  1 star is too many for this company.

I was a little apprehensive about buying tires by myself.  As a woman, going into Auto shops for anything I always feel like I'm going to be taken advantage of.  However, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the care and genuine honesty of Josh at this Discount Tire.  I went in to purchase 2 new tires, I knew I needed one more, but my budget didn't allow for a third one this month.  After talking with him (Josh), he explained the condition of the 3rd tire and quite honestly the 4th tire.  He showed them to me and he was right!  I do need two more tires.  The pricing was VERY reasonable and he was spot on with the length of time to put them on.  I will go back for my other two tires in a week or so and I hope that Josh is there again.  Thanks Josh for all your help!

Last weekend we had the oil changed in my Altima, the guys were ftiendly, informative and very professional. Today we didn't pass emission which I knew would be a problem but hoped the oil change would work for me. Not so much...We took the car back here to have diagnostics run, discovered we needed an EGR valve and the carbon blown out. Not sure if we were over charged, but the car us running better and we'll find out about emissions on Tuesday. I have no complaints, well maybe one...Don't give me grief about being a Bears fan!

I found this business though Living Social on Facebook...I could not be happier to have found it.  Although my waistline will disagree!  The owners are friendly and fun spirited.  The cupcakes are AWESOME!!!  I know, you'll say...it's just cake.  NOT!  There cakes are amazing!  I went to another cupcake place; one that was on the popular hit tv show Cupcake Wars and was really disappointed...cupcakes were not cooked all the way and the frostings all tasted the same.  Top It is kid friendly and clean (until the kids get there) and their flavors are OFF THE HOOK!  I double dog dare you not to l ike their cupcakes.

I was so surprised when we pulled up this adorable little place.  From all the pictures I thought this would be a HUGE place, but remarkably, it's small, quaint and unassuming.  The people that greeted us when we walked in were very kind; when we told them we had never been here before they took the time to tell us about the place and about the food.  We made our decisions and sat in the zen garden under a full shade umbrella.  They brought our food and beverage and we had a foodgasm!  The Watermelon gazpacho was A.MA.ZING!  I indulged in the OMG sandwich which was to DIE FOR good and my friend indulged in the Capreze (sp wrong I'm sure) and she didn't talk much while she ate.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this little place and even though I live in Gilbert, AZ I will make the trek back.  Thanks so much for a wonderful lunch!

This is the 2nd time we've been here and I have to say...WONDERFUL!  Service is spot on!  Food was delicious and not over priced, you also get great sized portions.  We had enough to take home for another meal!  Beer is cold, Service is warm and ambience is hot!  Plenty to do if you are into Darts, Wii(like) golf, Cornhole and Poker.  They have TV screens everywhere to watch whatever game(s) are on, they have an outdoor seating area with bar for smokers.  It's well lite and they provide misters on warm nights.  We went to another place and sat there for over 8 minutes when we left without being served.  We came here and within a minute or less the server was there to take our order AND apologized for not getting there sooner.  All in all, I think we will be repeat customers...Thanks Jolie's Place for making us feel VISIBLE!

I have to say that although I thought it was a little pricey.  The gentleman that was working that day made the visit fun.  There are some beautiful items there and had I had enough money to pay for gas after making a purchase I would have bought a thing or two.  But for me and my budget it was too expensive.  Not to say for others it would not be.  I love the quaintness of the store, Items are beautifully displayed and again, the gentleman in there was friendly, funnier than shit and made the visit very very pleasant.  Oh, parking is rough, but I've seen worse.

Went here lately night with family and friends after a spring training game. We were seated outside and it was a perfect night. Most of us ordered the Apocalypse Sow, I had the lettuce wraps, one grandson had burger and fries other grandson had something called madam something. Portions were huge!!!!  Everyone got quiet and you could tell we all enjoyed the food. Water, tea and beer was flowing and the service was really good. Very nice experience. Thanks Check Please, AZ for the review. We had a great time.

Since my nail gal is now at this shop of course I will follow her. After reading some if the reviews I was a little skeptical. However, what a pleasant surprise!  All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The other clients actually engaged in conversation with me, had a fun fun lady next to me and the tech doing her nails was funny and very nice. It's a bit of a drive to go to east mesa from Gilbert, but so worth it. Beautiful shop, comfortable chairs, friendly staff and competitive pricing. Diane, you leave here and you're on your own...lol just kidding.

Since the girl who has been doing my nails for the last 8 yrs moved to Encore, I had no choice but to give it a go. So glad I did! Clean, sanitary, multiple color choices,wonderful vibrating chairs that actually work.  Aside from Diane being my go to girl, this place was awesome and I'll be back.

So happy to find out that the shop has new owners and the shit techs are gone....Bravo Encore for realizing that quality work and good customer service go hand in hand. Plus, if past clients had any issues they will be more than happy to fix and make right. If anyone was unhappy before, give em a second chance. You owe them that much...

Stopped in here on Sunday with a couple friends.  I wish I could say we had a great experience but unfortunately it's quite the opposite.  A couple of things come to mind...1. It's coupled with a yogurt place and the gentleman who was helping us with our yogurt order spoke very poor english.  2.  The woman "helping" was only interested in know if we were done yet and not interested in helping the poor guy with 3 orders of yogurt.  She was pushy to get us to the register to pay for our greatly overpriced yogurts and water, but did NOTHING to speed up the process.  3.  We paid $25.83 for 3 small yogurt cups and 3 bottles of water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only did I almost throw up in my mouth because of the price of the yogurt...but the yogurt was AWFUL!  Too thick, and flavorless.  Only two flavors to choose from anyway and neither one were worth $1 let alone $25!  We will NEVER come back to this place for anything, not even directions....I think some training in the customer service dept is desperately needed and a lesson in yogurt making.  Oh and while you're at it...can you hire someone with a handle on the english language too please.

We stopped in last night about 6ish to grab a bite and a beer.  I've been here before but just for the beer; which I enjoy.  However, last night we walked in and sat at the counter facing the bar and we waited and we waited and we waited and we waited for someone, anyone to come up and take our order.  We sat there for 8 minutes and NO ONE approached us.  it was not busy in there at that time, in fact there were several open tables and still 5 or 6 open seats at the counter and 5-6 open seats at the bar.  One of the owners was talking to one of the servers, the bartenders were chatting with the guests at the bar (I'm sure they could see us sitting there right in front of them).  We were VERY disappointed, so we left.  We really do enjoy the beer and we hoped to make this a usual spot for us to go.  But NO SERVICE after waiting 8 minutes on a Sunday night when it's not busy??!!!  Really?  I'm not sure we will be back.  BEER = LOVE,  SERVICE = SUCKS

Very disappointed!  Spent over an hour with the sales girl, paid a  deposit for the Fantasia phone, told her we would be back Wednesday to pick them up.  So on Wednesday after waiting another 30 or more minutes in the store to talk to our sales girl, she told us no phones were available!  A good salesperson would have called us and let us know before we made the trip in or told us when she saw us sitting there that the phones were not available!  Too bad for her! Will never do business with them.  They took our money but had no phone.  Not good business practice!

I have to admit I was not going to like them. I have had my car washed at different places in the area and they always try to up sell or tell me I need a new windshield.  So driving up to the car wash I had already convinced myself that this was going to be like pulling teeth just to get my Damn car washed! I couldn't have been more wrong! Of course he wanted me to have it detailed but after explaining that I was not going to be keeping the car he backed off and just let me tell him what I wanted.  It was during this conversation that suddenly the suburban behind me ran into my car!!  Scared the hell out of me...well as it turned out it was another employee in the suburban, he immediately came over to make sure I was alright, we checked my car over; luckily no damage just a loose trunk. He got his manager and the wrote up an incident report, told me where to take the vehicle and they would cover any expense.  Then they washed, vacuumed and cleaned my car for free. Needless to say I skeptical about them paying for any damages...I figured it's a nice way to get me put without making a scene.  But, they did just what they promised! Thankfully nothing wrong with the car, the trunk or the axle.  I went back to thank them, they checked it out, changed a brake light and offered me a free complete detailing of my car. Shawn, the manager and Erik were AMAZING! They understand customer service.  I will come back again and again...I can't thank them enough for being honest stand-up guys. Thanks so much!

I heard that one of my favorite local bands was going to be there; Chuckie baby and the All stars", so we decided to go and see what this B&G was all about...We received a coupon for a free order of Calamari when we walked thru the door!  AWESOME!  We found a seat and perused the menu...I ordered a Mr. Pineapple beer and my husband ordered something else - can't remember.  We placed the order for the calamari and the waiter came back for our dinner order.  I ordered crap cake and my husband ordered...Fish and chips ( i remember now).  When they brought the calamari and the dipping sauces I was pleasantly surprised to see the portion size was actually big enough for two!  When they brought the dinners my husbands fish and chips portion was enormous!  Enough for 2 all by itself!  However...my crap cakes...disappointing.  First they were very mushy and didn't have ANY chunks of crab in them and it really tasted more like a tuna patty rather than crab and it was small!  I mean if I'm going to pay $12 for something I would hope it would be worth it in both proportion and flavor... So, although I gave this 4 stars it was more because of the service and my husbands fish n chips.  If I based it solely on my crab cake it would definately get 1 star.   OH...and the band?  FABULOUS as always!

I'm not sure why this was even considered to be,a good idea. Fondue is best when the cheese is kept warm and dippable. It is not supposed to be served in a Styrofoam cup. So disappointed, the cheese was cooling faster than we could dip, which made the dipping difficult. We trashed it and left. As this is a somewhat new diner and a new concept, perhaps a little guidance in ordering would have made sense. Instead the,young man just stood there not saying anything. Poor customer service, poor food quality. I won't be back. We wasted $24 we could have spent somewhere else. Good luck keeping this place open, you need to rethink the concept.

In my opinon, when a restaurant has a waiting Time  of 45 or more and folks are willing to wait, it must be worth it. Our wait time was 60 minutes...not horrible since they are by the Farmers Market and we could browse and shop while we wait and they'll text when a table is ready.  This what we did, then came back to Snooze, enjoyed a cocktail then text us the table was ready.  We ordered the Benny Duo, which offered us two choices since we couldn't decide. Both of us enjoyed our choices of food; the mimosa and bloody Mary was outstanding. Service was spot on. We were able to enjoy our food  and drinks, some music and a lot of laughs. As far as the price, I could not complain. Two breakfasts 4 cocktails for $40 is not bad. We REALLY enjoyed everything from start to finish. My friend was here from Vegas, but said when they come back she wants to come back. I'm a local and will most definitely be back. Thank you Snooze for an amazing experience.

I'm always a little leary about trying sushi without any previous knowledge of the place. This was very good. The place was busy but we were seated and the server was very attentive and answered all our questions. If there's a dowside it's not the food it was the level of noice. But I could just be overly sensitive to the noice level.  We didn't have to wait too long for our food or drinks. Well done Yaganaki...we'll be back.
