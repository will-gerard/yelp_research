I am normally turned off by the Caucasian-Mexican fare, but came to On the Border at the behest of my step-daughter. The hostess was friendly and prompt.  Of note, the phone rang while she was serving us and a male employee, most likely a manager, looked at her with disdain and sarcastically and within earshot of customers said "don't worry, I'll get the phone". Crass dude. But the hostess let it roll off and was kind and pleasant. Right away, our fantastic server Tynese came bearing perfect chips and salsa. I don't care for the greasy chips that one may be used to. These were great. So great that we had to add the fantastic queso dip.  To my chagrin, I learned that the restaurant did not have Jamaica tea listed on the menu.  I was excited to have it and was shot down! Our meals came out promptly, and were enjoyed by all. I opted for the Baja, which is a chicken and cheese stuffed avocado, paired with a sour cream chicken enchilada. I was pleasantly surprised. The rice and refried beans were nothing special, but the overall meal was great. Tynese was prompt and polite, and should be considered an asset to your business. We may visit your restaurant again in the future...probably when the east valley is sans snowbirds.

In snowbird season, please don't torture yourself by trying to come here. 'Nuff said on that.  The food is Americanized Mexican fare in a colorful environment. The margaritas are good, especially the mango. The huevos rancheros are good. Nothing here to write home about. The service usually stinks. Super long waits for your food and also for any drink refill.  I waited half of my life to finally see my server to get the bill and get the beck out of there.  Let me also say that this was NOT during snowbird season, and didn't seem exorbitantly busy.  Mediocre at best, I wouldn't recommend Los Gringos. It's for crazy white people (ha!) who are afraid of real Mexican food.

I unfortunately need to do yearly blood work. This is the most convenient Sonora Quest. You may make an appointment, or choose to fly by the seat of your pants and come in appointment free.  Let me first talk about the location. The suite is in a primarily medical complex with an urgent care and Banner Ironwood, among other things. This makes for a convenient location. The parking is ok, but be prepared to be shot by a random rogue sprinkler head at any given time. The waiting room and draw rooms are always clean. The staff is normally very kind. The desk staff is usually a bit more grumpy than the phlebotomists. I suppose it is because they have to deal with snowbirds and impatient people.  With that, I segway into the need to be extremely patient. There are always a hundred million hacking, sneezing oxygen tank-using Minnesotans waiting here at any given time. I do make online appointments each time, and am always exuberant that I did after 5 minutes of sharing air with the people in there. Sometimes I wait longer than my appointment time, which stinks. I think that they either need more staff, or something with paperwork and administrative functions are not done efficiently. For a two second blood draw, the process seems to take an exorbitant amount of time, leaving the quantity of people in the waiting room seemingly never-ending.

The Pork Shop is a gem in Southeast Egypt of Queen Creek. You know you're in the right place when you see the giant metal pig-shaped smoker. The shop has a website, so do plan ahead. Things sell out fast here.  Ordering ahead is your best bet if you want something specific.  Jason (The Mustache) Corman and his family run a great family shop, where the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. The meat is priced inconceivably low. The snack sticks are fantastic.  My favorite apple snack sticks are almost always sold out. The fresh chorizo is the best I've had in my life. The hot and fresh green chile burritos in the hot box behind the counter are a must if you have never tried one. The beans, ribs and BBQ pork in the warmer are great too, especially if you're looking for a quick serve item or aren't a grill master.  If you like the flavors, ask for the house rub for your own grilling adventures. The myriad bacon flavors are fantastic,  our house favorite being BBQ bacon.  Take the time to visit The Pork Shop. For sure. Just save me some.

This location was located at the south end of a retail strip. There is another Italian place at the northwest section of this corner, but don't make the mistake.  Pasquale (I think?) Was friendly and welcoming. The eggplant appetizer was fantastic, served bruschetta-style with warm tomatoes on top. The garlic - cheese bread was a perfect balance of soft and crusty.  I had the manicotti. The ricotta was flowing from the noodles and was PERFECT.  The sauce was amazing...not too salty, not too sweet.  It tasted amazingly fresh.  My co-worker has an Alfredo chicken parmesan, with perfectly cooked fetuccine.  The sauce wasn't too heavy, and paired with that perfect chicken was....well, perfect!   I have already recommended this place to several dolks, and will be back!

Ted's is always awesome for a quick bite. They might have a line out the door but they're super efficient, fast and friendly. The food is always to die for: fresh and hot. If it looks like there's a ton of people in there, don't be discouraged. The line moves faster than you'll ever realize and they take your order way before you're near the counter. It's not the same person preparing all of your food so its all getting done at the same time and you don't have to wait. They have a drink person, a grill person, a fry person, a shake person... As long as you're okay with the Buffalo Bills pennants around the place (haha), you'll really enjoy your meal and experience here.

How fantastic to have such a great getaway this close to home! I was frustrated that when booked in a group block, the reservations department can't view or alter reservations. Changes could only be made with group reservations during banker's hours. We ended up just keeping our reservation the same, for an extra night above the event...and we were glad we did. The king room was clean and spacious. The mattress was super-comfy. I need this mattress! Locally made snacks for purchase were a nice bonus. The staff was wonderful...except for the banquet employee at the open bar of the event we were attending. She embarrassed a friend by blatantly asking him and his wife if they belonged at the event. They went and retrieved their place card and ID to be served. This was asked of no one else. The room service and Red's menus were lacking on variety, but the fare we did have was great. The pecan-crusted tilapia at Red's was amazing. The steak was flavorful and seared to perfection. The service at the Wigwam Bar was also wonderful. Drinks were strong and abundant. The pool was a bit too MTv Beach House for us, but the kids would love the tunes and the waterslide. We will be back for a staycation soon!

Royal Thai Grill is our go-to Thai restaurant. It may be a hole in the wall, it may not be pretty, but those are the best kind. Art and Nancy have been here for 17 years (I think) , and we've been coming for at least 15.    The menu is not expansive, but has flavorful selections. Our favorites are the panang and pad Thai, with the satay as an appetizer. Spice is always to order, and the food fresh, hot and delicious.  As far as rebutting the other comments regarding the atmosphere and service: Art is from Thailand. Hence Thai food. He speaks broken English and does not sugar coat things. It's not his way. But make no mistake, he values every customer and is thankful for his successful restaurant. He is, as one gentleman noted, very diverse and interesting. He was a musician before getting a pacemaker. He did some crazy stuff in Thailand, which he'll tell you about freely if you indulge him. The music memorabilia and periodicals all around are things he loves and wants to share .  Give Royal Thai a chance. But keep in mind, it is Thai. Not Chinese. The people ordering like it's Chinese or Panda Express in a Thai restaurant amazes me. This food is the jam.

East Valley Tire is our go-to shop. We like that we are patronizing a family establishment, and the owner always remembers us.  You don't get the run around and nobody tries to upsell you for things you don't need.  I will also say that if they notice something wrong, they will not hesitate to make you aware, caring about the safety of the customer.  We blew a tire enroute to a big gig, and were loaded down with music equipment. They were super fast, and we were back on the road in no time!  If you need a tire or 4 and some fast, honest service, visit East Valley Tire. While you're there, play tug with Toyo, the friendly shop dog. (Just watch your water bottles. She loves those.)

This Jamba Juice is great. Clean, customer-oriented and fast. The manager always remembers what I had last and what my favorites are. And did I mention clean???  Keep in mind that parking here is a nightmare, but luckily there are 15 min spots in front, and you will be out of there way before that. They are very quick with your goods!  Props to management here for instilling customer service values in their staff.

The staff was nice, and the environment artistic and relaxing. The menu is a bit pricey, but its the price to pay for artistic fare. I tried to order the specialty, Chiles en Nogada, but was told that it was seasonal and unavailable, despite being listed on the menu. I then ordered the Granada con Flor de Jamaica. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the hibiscus sauce flavorful and addictive. The spicy mash accompaniment was just ok. The fresh brewed iced tea was wonderful. The olive tapanade with the bread was great as well. My husband had the carne asada tacos, which were ok. For a local, this is a special occasion type of place. I will definitely take out of town visitors to lunch or dinner here.  Not to mention that the local street art is the jam!

This was my first visit for what I've been told is excellent pizza. Yelp reviews are mixed, so I opted to take the gamble   The location was easy to find and had ample parking. Seating was plentiful and the online ordering and payment process made it super easy to run in and pick up. There was a separate pick up window, which was great to avoid the ordering line.  I ordered the Pizza Blanco. From RI, white pizza is a staple. This pizza was completely underwhelming. Tons of ricotta, but not enough mozzarella to hold it on. I would hesitate calling this NY pizza. The crust was ...eh.  The flavor was ...eh. I had even added olives and mushrooms and they added nothing to help this pizza.  We added the chocolate cake for dessert. This was a heavy prefab ice box cake. It tasted ok, but was nothing special.  Overall, Venezia's is not somewhere I would return to. While the staff member I had contact with was super nice, everything about this pizza parlor was average.  I would rather drive to Cassanova Brothers or even have a Hot and Ready junk pizza from Little Caesar's.

Management at Venezia's urged me to give their business another shot. That was 8 months ago. I finally had the opportunity to give it another go.  The online ordering system was better than in the past. You can now pay online OR in store.  The staff was again phenomenal.  Nat (or Nate?) was friendly, accommodating and charismatic.  A great face for your front counter.  This time around, I ordered the fried zucchini and a thin-crust pepperoni, mushroom and black olive pizza with added fresh mozzarella and light sauce.  The crust was not as thin as expected...I felt it was a regular crust style. I will say, however, that the crust was chewy and flavorful, crisp in all the right places. The toppings were plentiful, and the light sauce just enough.  The cannoli was filled freshly on the spot. The shells were crispy and sweet, and the contents the perfect sweetness.  I really enjoyed this time around,  and I'm really glad that I gave Venezia's another chance. Thanks to Dominick and the other staff for convincing me to try other items for an updated review/assessment of their place. I'll be back!

In a pinch, we eat here because it is basically right next to the house.  The interior restaurant is unkempt and uninviting. The drive through takes a.million.years. to get your food. It all tastes ok at first, then you spend your afternoon in the bathroom. The menu got fairly expensive. It used to be the cheap burrito place to to. At $6.99 for a Chile relleno burrito that recycles in about 30 minutes, I'd say it's not worth it.

At first call, one would think that Jim from Middleton Air was mean. When my warranty company dispatched him and he called to schedule us for service, that was my impression. Turns out he's a nice guy, just a bit rough on the phone. My only area of disappointment here is the scheduling. This guy works hard, but maybe to his detriment, because he overbooked himself.  We put our service call Wed. He called to schedule Thu. Morning and said that he was so busy that he couldn't get us in until Sat. Sucks because it's 106 outside. We are at their mercy and the mercy of the warranty company, so oh well. He says Sat between12 and 3. My husband stays home from work to meet him, because I can't. I call at 2 for an update and he says now more like 4 or 5, but closer to 5. Just after 5, he's on his way from PV, 45+ minutes away! I got home around 7 and he was finishing up, with other jobs still in his queue! I will say, Jim was to the point and fixed us up great. I worry about this guy overdoing it though. Slow down and take what you can handle!

Once upon a time, we sat in Scuttlebutt's for dinner. It was not memorable, with the exception of the owner giving us a loaf of homemade bread at the end of the night.  Fast forward 10 or so years. Nearly forgotten, we decided to order to go, and try our luck. Ordering over the phone was atrocious. I felt like either someone had something going on in the background, or he was just disinterested.  I get there to pick up my meal. One half-drunk old dude in the restaurant. No one else. My order is not ready, so I wait, striking up casual conversation with the staff and the stool pigeon. My order is ready. Only, it's not. I'm missing items. They now must be cooked. I wait some more.  I finally get home with dinner. Every. Frickin. Thing. Was. Burnt. No joke! Clamdigger sandwiches, burnt clamstrips and nothing else in a roll. Calamari, burnt. Mozzarella sticks, burnt. So disappointed. We will not return.

I have recently been seeing Dr. Tarlian and have had 4 vein ablations. The staff is great, from Ashley and Brittany at the desk, to all the procedural staff and Ultrasound techs.   Dr. Tarlian does have a great bedside manner and sense of humor. He explains everything very well and I have never felt uncomfortable nor uninformed. The facility is clean and organized.  I highly recommend the Western Vascular staff and especially Dr. Tarlian.

This is a quaint place in a strip mall off Power Rd. The owner and who I presume is her daughter are very nice and remember me each time. However, I don't always feel that they are super attentive if there are other dine-in patrons when I'm picking up take-out.  I'm not a fan of the pad Thai, as I find theirs kind of wet and slimy. I LOVE, however, the panang. I do shrimp and tofu. Both are amazing. I don't love tail-on shrimp, but the flavor is great. The mango sticky rice is fantastic as well (when it's in season).

When my dentist retired,  I was apprehensive about finding a new provider. It seems like these days, practices are sales driven and not service driven. Who wants pressure to buy at the dentist, like a used car lot?  I looked up Nielson Dentistry and the reviews. People said that there was no sales pressure, and they felt very comfortable. I could not agree more. I wish I could have them clean my teeth every day. I love going to the dentist. ..it's like a tooth massage! The staff is so friendly, and always remember you. Even though I go in just twice a year for cleanings, the staff is like family.   If you are nervous about the dentist,  give Dr. Nielson a try. His staff will put you at ease. So will the tv you can watch on the ceiling, on any channel that suits you. They are thorough, and I always feel great afterward.   I would highly recommend Nielson Dentistry, and hope he's around for a long time!

I would visit this place for the bathrooms alone. I won't spoil it if you've never been. This is a casual joint that's always packed. The food is great. We enjoy the seasonal milkshakes, the Ahi and Portobello sandwiches and the Fontina burger. The garlic fries are just ...eh. The rings and zucchini are good.  That all being said, I don't like eating here in the summer. The outdoor condiments get warm and the place gets infested...I mean INFESTED with flies. Like "I can't eat here. Can I get this to go instead?" Flies.

Who doesn't love Chompies? If you raise your hand, you are banished and deserve all the corn dogs and pb&j you can get.  The food at Chompies is always amazing. Some favorites include the lox, the Monte Cristo and the meat knish.  The deli selections are fantastic as well.  My only (not even) complaint is that when we came last time, a huge party came in and hadn't called ahead first. The manager let them (and everyone else) know out loud of his discontent. Then they were seated before us!   Every so often, you get a young server who should find another vocation, but we, for the most part, always have great service. Once we were in late, and we're gifted the end of the day bagels! Oh happy day!  Chompies is so much more than a Jewish Deli. It is a place for food, memories, family and friends.

This King's trip was a birthday dinner for me.  We had never been, reviews were ok and the menu enticing.  So last night we made a reservation for 630. Upon arrival, it is confusing because the entrance is on the north, when parking is behind. So then we went in the wrong door, into the Oyster Bar, not seeing a clear entrance. The hostess was fantastic, and we were seated right away. Our server Steven came to take the drink order promptly, but did not return promptly. I sat there for a good 20 minutes with a super hard chunk of cold bread with warm butter...and no drink. Our drinks were dropped, but we were not asked if we were ready to order or if we had any questions in the menu. And we wait. My pina colada was not well blended and quickly looked like the crushed ice at the bottom of your big gulp after the beverage is gone. Should have just gotten a beer or something else. Our orders are taken. And we wait. The cold platter arrives, which has an ample sampling of shrimp, crab and oysters with the accoutrements. The oysters were fresh and sweet. Horseradish freshly ground. I can't compare the oysters, since I've never had an oyster before. The shrimp were large and also fresh. I was not exactly elated at having to dig the intestinal tract out of most of my shrimp. I wasn't expecting to devein before I eat at a restaurant. The crab was not served with a cracker, so we tried our best on the thinner shelled legs. When we finally see Steven later, we ask for a cracker. And we wait. We finally finish in time for the entrees to arrive with perfect timing. I have the crab cakes with asparagus. Both are tasty and are cooked well. My husband ordered the N'Awlins BBQ shrimp. The sauce was hot but not very flavorful. At least those shrimp had been deveined! There was a random piece of lemon mixed in, and my husband, thinking it a pepper or something, got a big sour surprise! The entrees went well overall. And we wait. The hostess clears our table and my husband has been waiting for another beer for.ever. Steven returns and says "Are you all set and done or did you want dessert?". Maybe I'm crazy, but I found it a bit brash. It's not like I'm getting a free meal and someone told you I'm a crappy tipper (I'm an excellent topper, btw...I was a server once). Dessert (yes I want it! It's my birthday!) was Strawberry Shortcake, but only since they were out of Creme Brulee. Who runs out on Thursday?? Boo. The shortcake was cold, dry and hard. Not impressed.  It is not likely that we will return to King's Fish House.

I had my first visit with a friend today whom I agreed to go hiking with. The volunteer folks at the gate were fantastic and friendly; a married elderly couple.  We went early enough that the parking area was open. The area was very clean.  Let me first stress that I am a rookie hiker. And by rookie, I mean that I don't hike. I don't ladder.  I definitely dont walk ledges over mountain cliffs! To my surprise, my friend took me on the Pass Trail. The trail was clean, with the exception of rude hikers not picking up their dogs' feces!   My friend was less than candid at the length of, and skill level required for the trail. I made it to the Saddle and then she broke the news...we were going all the way around! This trail has lots of ups, downs, boulder hops and slippery terrain. I thought that I couldn't do it anymore! Luckily we has enough water, but I am in desperate need of new feet and calves. I sadly realized that for every downhill comes an uphill. Holy shiitake man!   My personal triumph finishing this monster trail aside, the park system is well maintained and has lots of programs to offer. Another plus: the bathrooms welcoming me after a 6-hour, 8+ mile surprise hike were clean and fully stocked with tp!  Keep up the good work volunteers!

Our family ended up trying this restaurant by default. We were actually trying to go next door, but they were closed.   We were happy to see that they were priced very moderately. The teriyaki bowls were only like 7 bucks and were a great deal. They are one of the few places that serve bulgogi, and the meat was tender and tasty. The sushi is ok and is moderately priced as well.  (I think the octopus was fake though.) The happy hour sushi pricing made it well worth it!  The service was really great. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is that they served things whenever they were ready and didn't serve them at the same time. Some people were almost finished with their meal by the time others receive theirs. Our drinks were never empty and our empty plates were never sitting around waiting to be taken.    We will definitely be returning here soon.

This Rubio's in Mesa Riverview is clean and friendly. The salsa bar was clean and refreshed often. I was disappointed to find that Rubio's is not yet on the online ordering bandwagon. I'm not a fan of waiting around and taking up a dining room seat. But I will say that my order was prepared and ready with lightening speed!  The seasonal langostino burrito is always awesome, and the tomatillo salsa rivals my own (gratuitous booster). The chips and refried beans are ridiculously good.  The fish tacos, citrus shrimp burrito and street tacos are excellent. Even a plain salad is good, and they will accommodate your diet; in my case adding bay shrimp and salsa only to a plain salad. Everything has been fantastic.   This franchise is a good one in the chain, and I appreciate their wonderful customer service.

Saigon Bowl is not in my top hundred of Vietnamese restaurants. I'm no stranger to dives, so it's not that. It is the wait, the service and the food.  Even for call in orders, there is an exorbitant wait time. For pho, this is ridiculous. Normal pho broth is simmering all day, no? Well, the first thing that weirded me out was the fact that they asked if I wanted chicken or beef broth. Um....neither! I want the fermented fish broth that is the staple of pho! Blasphemers! I was not happy with the noodle quality either. They were clearly dry noodles of a lesser quality.  The counter service is curt and unfriendly. As I watched each patron come in or order, it was clear to me that customer service is not the strong suit here. I think they may have been annoyed with people in general...Asian or not. I also am suspicious of Vietnamese restaurants that try to supplement their menu with crappy Chinese-American food. If you do something well, you wouldn't have to cater to the apartments around you for cheap Chinese take-out.

I really like this Sprouts. The store is clean and stocks just about everything. On this trip in particular, I was shopping for raw juices. I found a great juice section that satisfied my need completely. While in store, I picked up some great cuts of lamb and a wrap for the hubby. This store has a huge deli area and bulk items that are fantastic. My only dislike is how everything is laid out. With merchandise everywhere, in no particular order, it's difficult to dodge soccer moms and their broods in the small walkways. The staff is phenomenal. I found the cashier and other employees to be kind, helpful and genuinely happy and content to be there, which is rare. I appreciate this store, and will continue to patronize it.

I am lucky to work across the street from George's. Picking up or eating in are fast for those in the go! Bonus: you can now order and pay on Grub Hub, so it's even faster!  Now, be prepared if you hit the lunch rush to wait.  This place is jamming during that time with all the local businesses and contractors.  I highly suggest pre-ordering!  Bummed they close at 8, but they've got lives too!   The staff is always laid back and friendly. George is.the.jam. He's super nice, hilarious and appreciates his customers.  There is always something cool on tv, be it new or from days of yore. His business also always contributes to our yearly Christmas charity for kids. Decent.  Ok, to the food. There is nothing bad on the menu. The gyros are great. The salads are great. The pizza and pastas are great. My favorites are the spanakopita and the dolmades.  Though they are appetizers, the abundance of food makes for a great finger food lunch as well! Not feeling Greek? They have American and Italian selections as well.  To the reviewer commenting on the cold dolmades, if you have been in AZ a while, you may notice that most are served this way, especially since they are not meat dolmas. I will tell you this...if you want something a certain way to which you are accustomed, just ask! The staff at George's will certainly oblige if you want your dolmades hot.  I make changes and omit ingredients all the time and they are super cool.  If you enjoy basic Greek, you must patronize this establishment.

At first, going to Flancer's was the kids' choice. Now the adults even suggest this restaurant for dinner. There are two Flancer's, one on Higley and one on Gilbert. We have been to both, but we frequent the one on Higley. Its always busy yet you never have to wait too long for a table. The booths are huge and can accommodate your parties easily.       The atmosphere is very laid back and there's always good tunes flowing. The old concert posters on the wall are a nice touch.      If you have never tried anything prickly pear before, you've got to have the chicken. The perfect prickly pear chicken salad or sandwich is a sure bet. They also have homemade lemonade that is amazing. All the sandwiches appetizers and desserts are fantastic here. You really need more than one visit to be able to try other things, such as the "We must meat, I ain't lion" , "Steak it to the limit" or the "Let it B.L.T.". The green Chile mayo is a must, as is the goat cheese bruschetta appetizer.      The service is always great. After a million years of coming here, we've never had a bad experience.  I will say that we ordered their Thanksgiving meal to go package one year and were underwhelmed. But that's not the everyday stuff, so we don't hold it against them! We will come here forever.

La's is a family-owned and operated Thai place in the Commerce Center retail strip. The owner and her daughter and super friendly and accommodating.  The food is always hot and fresh. I have had better Thai, but this does rank pretty high among east valley Thai spots. The pad thai is decent. A bit sweet, bit still tasty and spiced to order. The Thai iced tea is a little bit wimpy, but still good.  The panang curry is nice.  Spiced to order and with the protein of your choice, this is one of my favorite dishes.  I will continue to come back to La's often.

Just north of the main entrance to Mekong, Com Tam Thuan Kieu always is a good bet. The food is fantastic. No pho here; they specialize in broken rice dishes.         This also happens to be one of a very few places that carry shrimp paste. If you've never had this before, it is ground shrimp that is cooked wrapped around a sugar cane. It is amazing and we come here time and time again adding that to our bun.      Those who have commented on the service here are correct, however it just appears to be cultural . Each time I come here for a to go order, I have ordered with the more westernized teenagers that work at the front. Every time they remember our favorite orders and treat us with nothing but respect and gratitude for our patronage.       If you are a foodie and enjoy Vietnamese, I would definitely suggest you try this place out. You will not be disappointed.

UnPhogettable is more than a pho joint with a witty name.  In the Mekong plaza, which you may recognize as a running theme for me, unPho is a gem. We go here for the fantastic pho and friendly service.  They make any kind of pho you could think of, and all are expertly crafted with the perfect base.  My husband, the carnivorous maximus, opts for the tripe and meatball, while I am a veggie pho girl.  We have also tried the bun (vermicelli) here, and it's just ok. The pork is great though, and the owner will give you his cooking secrets if you ask! Speaking of whom is SUPER friendly, and always thanks you for your patronage. He remembers the regulars as well and gets excited when you bring friends and family to share the experience.  If you enjoy great pho, don't hesisate to give unPhogettable a try!

Chicago's #1 Gyro is solid Greek street eats.  Owner Joe and his folks run this legit, Chicago- style eatery.  The place is casual and relaxed, with a semi-fast food feel. Think plastic baskets with parchment and Styrofoam cups.  The spanikopita is a huge triangle of spinach and feta perfection. The fries are crispy and hot. Our household has had pretty much everything on the menu. Great gyros, shwarma, falafel, burgers, chicken and vegetarian fare. I love the Vegetarian Delight, which includes pita, hummus, falafel and the best dolmades ever.   Not feeling well? The lemon chicken soup will fix you right up.  We LOVE this place, and met Joe and his great family pretty much on day 1. The only demerit would be for the long waits and a counter girl that is not exactly the best at attention and customer service.  Call your food in to-go and have a fantastic lunch or dinner!

It was a gorgeous night to dine in on the patio at Gordon Biersch. The restaurant was clean and the ambiance good. Our waitstaff was fantastic and attentive.  The calamari appetizer was tasty, but rubbery and overdone. The drink selection was great.  I had a strawberry soda, which was refreshing and crisp. Our table had the peppered tuna, sirloin tips, gorgonzola chicken and lobster & shrimp Mac and cheese. The entrees were abundant, well prepared and displayed and were flavorful.   I was a bit disheartened to see that the menu was different than the website. We went with a prechosen dinner selection that was sadly abandoned when our options weren't on the menu.  I had read on other reviews that the menu changes often.  This is sad, since repeat customers don't appreciate that...if their favorites are around long enough that they chose to come back.  We will return to Gordon Biersch in the future.

Like another reviewer said "Don't freak out" when you walk in. You may get the feeling that you should walk right back out. You shouldn't.  We have been eating here for many years. The small restaurant is the owner and his wife. They may not speak the best English, but they know who we are and what our usual is when we walk in, or even call for takeout!  The Pho is tasty, with a quality base. Our fave though is the bun. The #41 with extra egg rolls! This place is one of only a few that serve shrimp paste. As opposed to the foul condiment you may get from restaurants of other regions, this is a ground, seasoned shrimp, steamed around sugar cane. It is to die for. I always get a Thai iced tea as well, done to precision. The shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce are fantastic.  Pho Nhat is worth a try. Don't be dissuaded by the look of the place or them raising the kids in the kitchen. The only turn off is a nasty exterior access bathroom. Just eat and then go over at subway next door!

This is not my first experience as a Panda Express customer. However this is my first time at this particular location.  Today I opted to use the online ordering system to order ahead and pick up on my way home from work. I sadly found out that this was a joke. This location has no organization and no communication.  The confirmation email advised me to go to the Express online order pickup area for my food. As it turns out, this is the same area as everyone else waiting to pay who has stood in line. I was ignored for a good amount of time before I was finally asked if I had been helped. The girl disappeared to find my order and did not return for 20 minutes. When a woman, who appeared that she was the manager, asked if I had been helped, I advised her that I was still waiting for an online order. No one had ever communicated with me that they were waiting on an item to be cooked to complete my order. I was simply ignored standing in the same spot for 25 minutes.  I only found out this fact because I overheard the girl advise her manager. And still I waited.   After that amount of time, I was hastily handed my bag of food.  The order was not verified with me, and I had to advise her that I had other items and a drink as well. I am walking out of there currently very unsatisfied with my experience.  I do realize that it was quite busy in the store. I am normally very patient and give a lot of credit to those in the food industry. But there is never any reason to ignore or treat a customer rudely.  On a side note, regarding the online ordering system, there was a woman next to me who had issues with online ordering and had been charged upwards of $300 for a simple order. Granted, I had no issue at all, but take heed when using the online system.

I have always lived F&E since its inception here in AZ. Fresh meals at reasonable prices. And with no reasonable close AJs, Whole Foods or Sprouts, this was a welcome and needed addition to the area.  Then they started closing. First went my home store on Ellsworth and Main.  Today was my last hoorah at this Crimson store.  Today there was an event that made me sad for this generation of teens and young adults.  I'm going to need a big restoration of my faith in humanity today.  The employee LEE was one of the only folks working. Young guy, maybe 19 or so.  A gal buys a bunch of stuff in sale and doesn't believe that she got the correct discount. Now listen, I don't know who was wrong and who was right, but does it matter in customer service? This guy laid his head down on the belt and sighed several times before cussing at this lady. When she called him on it, his answer was that " no one gives a crap because they're closing". She requests that he take the item off, she pays and starts to leave. He tells after here to " get the hell out of here lady". I could not believe it.  So I'm using a small checkout because none with belts are open. So imagine my chagrin when my machine need assistance not once, but twice. (Once for beer and once for an unrecognized item since I was overflowing). Oh for all that is holy I have to call this kid...  Each time, he sighs heavily at me and roll his eyes. I try to make light and thank him so I don't reap what he is sowing next.  Listen man, I'm truly sorry that your store is closing and that people are losing their jobs. That sucks to the fullest degree. But have a little respect. That lady you cuss out could be interviewing you for your next job. That lady is someone's mom. Maybe even someone's grandma. Have some respect and grow up Lee.

Like another reviewer wrote, "either you like it or you don't". It's In n Out Burger. They have burgers, fries and shakes. They're always hot, fresh and tasty. The staff is efficient and friendly. I'm not of the mindset to drive a zillion miles for one, but they're good stuff.

While on the southeast side of town, I happened across El Palacio. It looked enticing enough from the outside, and was cute and clean inside.  I did happen to notice that it was all booths and smaller tables, so I wonder how they would be accommodating larger groups.  The menu offerings seemed sparse and odd. One should make a mental note when the "Chef's Special" at a Mexican restaurant is a burger.  I reluctantly ordered the Queso-Dilla , which was like a quesadilla wrapped into a burrito with meat inside. It was actually really good, and in good proportion. My husband had the steak fajitas, which he said "were good". I don't know what that really means.  The bathrooms were unclean and had no TP, a huge no-no in a Mexican establishment, no? The service was good and the server friendly and attentive. But if he hey bro'd us one more time, I was going to give him the Bruce Lee one inch punch.  Overall, El Palacio was edible and underwhelming. We would probably pass it by in the future.

How could I not have known this place was down the street??? Asi es my Tierra is located at the east end of Lipovec Plaza, next to Jacob's Carneceria. The hours are horrible, which really is the only bad thing. During the week, they close at 5, so you can't even go in for dinner. Weekends are 8 or 9.  This is a small place that is family owned and operated. The menu is small, but includes some seafood and packs lots of different flavors. The pork tamales are decent, as are the beef tacos. The rice and beans are perfect. The pollo en mole was the best! Tortillas accompanying the food were fresh, homemade and free-flowing. The Carne Asada was hot and flavorful.  We enjoyed the chips and homemade salsa so much, we ordered a cup of salsa to go! I also thought that the Jamaica beverage was good - not too sugary or overpowering. ..just right. The bill came and was around $25 for dinner with some salsa to go, so very affordable.  Take out us also convenient!  We will certainly be back!

I have never been a huge fan of the food and service here, but with the lack of choices in the immediate area and the absolute NEED for a burger, we ordered takeout.  In the phone, the woman taking my order proceeded to give me a cooking lesson on how my rare burger might not be so rare when I get it home due to the cooking process. Are you kidding? I've cooked a few things in my day.  So, I arrive to pick up my order. I get a one-finger gesture over to the bar, where to-go orders are procesed. What a joke. There are a few dozen post-work drinkers in there, so I am promptly ignored for a while. One may think it easier to pick up at the hostess stand? There I go thinking again!  I then pay for my order with whom I can only assume is a manager. I then ask if I can have a few ranch. He passes the request to the bartender.  My name is called after a few awkward minutes trying to find a less intrusive place to stand. As I get my bag, I verbally verify that there are a few ranch in the bag. She says there are. Stupid me for not looking. Get home: nothing.  Beyond aggravated.  The burger was ok. The mozzarella sticks were excellent. Would have been better with ranch. Doh. A side salad of just lettuce cost an extra $1.75. Ridiculous. Not a pleasant experience. I don't know why I expected better.  Update this morning: GM Debbie contacted me for a follow-up, which was nice to see that they care about bettering customer service. She advised me that they are now looking in to better ways to complete the take-out orders. Thanks Debbie.

Let me just put out into the universe that Del Taco is not my first choice for a meal. But they normally have pretty decent french fries, and it works late night.  This is the first time I have patronized this Del Taco. There wasn't a very long line, so that was a good start. Then came the bad news: the grill was being cleaned, so there were no hamburgers available! What?! 11pm on a weekend and your grill is down? How the heck are you making quesadillas or anything else for that matter?  My husband ended up with some turkey tacos that were pretty good. You couldn't tell they weren't beef. Good in my book, maybe not so good for others. I got a beef and bean burrito and the fries. Loves the fries, hated the burrito. It was a sloppy mess and reminded me of a worse version of a microwave burrito. With the grill out of service, maybe it was microwaved! Who knows.  The cashier was not at all apologetic for the inconvenience,  and was actually pretty short with us. I mean. It's YOUR fault! Who cleans the grill before during peak night weekend time?

Jamba Juice is a very tasty alternative to lunch for me, a meal in a cup. Some people might not think so, but when you look at all the calories carbohydrates and sugars in any juice, even the light juices, this equates to a meal.  The store at this location is very clean. The gal that was working today was extremely friendly fast and informative. Today I opted for the Caribbean passion made light. It was very tasty and smooth.  I am however a little disappointed at the lack of boost available. From what I recall it used to be a much longer list. Also some of the types and ingredients have changed. For example, the zinc and antioxidant blend now contains soy. I'm allergic to soy so this isn't good news.

Yogi's is set on the back side of a retail complex at Ellsworth and Baseline, between a pool store and a Starbucks. It is usually busy, as a testament to good food and fast service.  My customary order is the Arizona Bowl and a Crunch Roll. The obviously imitation crab is still tasty on perfectly cooked rice. I've never had a bad bowl. My man gets either the chicken, beef or combo bowl. Each has perfectly cooked meat and flavorful sauce.  Recently I gave the Tofu Veggie Bowl and the Katsu Chicken a try. The tofu was good, with the teriyaki sauce over it just enough. The steamed veggies were just plain, and a bit too al dente for me. Still a good choice. My man said that the katsu was tasty, but a bit "chicken nuggety". I think that this may be because he is a fat and dark meat guy. My white meat self probably would have liked it.  As for the sushi rolls, I think that they are best left to a real sushi place. The Crunch Roll is always good, but it is tempura, so I don't worry as much. In this fast, plug and play restaurant, there is no possible way that the sushi ingredients are fresh.  A nice addition to the restaurant is the Coke Machine. I like the range of options. But in the close quarters, be ready for other people waiting for the machine in your personal space. Ugh!  Overall, Yogi's is a fast and tasty place to go for sit down or take out if you are in the area.

Bosa is a nice little place. Its not extravagant, but it has good drinks and great donuts.  The drive-through intercom is the worst. As if I didn't already dislike hearing my own voice, it comes right back to you in duplicate with feedback. The staff is friendly and service consistent. The speed at the drive thru is moderate, depending on how busy they are.  The fact that I can get a Thai tea boba at a drive-through is fantastic. Not the best one I've had, but it does the job. The donuts are always fresh. My personal favorite is the Boston Cream. I have also gotten a few sandwiches at this location. The turkey is just cheapie lunch meat, so I want impressed.  The bacon, egg & cheese is great on either a bagel or croissant. Neither are anything to write home about, but makes for a quick and sturdy breakfast.

We drive from the far east valley to have India Oven just for takeout! We do love dining in, but taking out is just as satisfying.  Indian Oven is a small, family-run restaurant.  The buffet is daily, or you may order off the menu. Most offerings, however, can be found on the buffet. The tandoori is flavorful and spicy. The tikka masala, both chicken and paneer, are a wonderful blend of vegetables and spices, in a texture to penetrate your perfectly cooked rice just enough. The saag and other offerings are plentiful and tasty as well.  From the menu, try a qeema naan one day. It is essentially a stuffed naan. Perfectly cooked and delectable.  Dessert items such as golub jamun and whatever the awesome carrot stuff is cool the palate, as does a nice cup of mango lassi (also offered on the buffet).  The prices are meager for the high quality food and service you receive. The staff remembers you when you come in, and is always attentive. Another bonus: India Oven is open 7 days!  If you enjoy Indian food or are looking to venture to something new, give them a try.

This Five Guys isn't the most convenient, since it is in the mall, but at least it is located toward the access road, so you don't have to actually go in to the mall.  I would die.  The location is, for the most part, clean. The music is pretty overwhelming, like I'm in a club for hipsters. One minute Tom Petty and the next some bluegrassy boy band. Unless you are standing right at the pick-up counter, good luck hearing that your food is ready.  Thank goodness you can now order your Five Guys fare online for pick-up.  It's cool that they make your fries when you get there so that they are fresh. However, it took so long to get them that one may wonder why they ordered ahead in the first place. I had ordered a drink as well, and when the guy slid my bag across the counter with no cup, I informed him that I had a drink too. The reply was "go over there and tell them to give you a cup" (them being the order counter).  The fries are normally awesome. Today my Cajun fries were just killed with spice. Virtually inedible. I went though 40 oz. of water during a 15 minute lunch! My little bacon burger was good. Better than some other fast food crap, but not exactly what you would assume you would get for your money.  I have come here before, and will likely come again in the future. Just a bit disappointed in this visit.

We frequently visit the Mekong Plaza for the fantastic myriad restaurants in the center. One of our favorites is Dim Sum in the Mekong Palace open air restaurant at the northwest end of the plaza.  The staff is usually pretty attentive, but we often feel like we get second class service as " the white folk in the room". We normally wait for beverage refills and the check.  If you can look past that as merely a cultural thing, you will like the offerings at Mekong Palace. The Dim Sum is plentiful and great quality. It's always hot, and the steam carts are on it like white on rice and a paper plate in a snowstorm! They are everywhere with the goods.  In addition to Dim Sum, we enjoy the sticky rice and other menu items. At least once a week, we get some BBQ pork or roasted pork from the window to take home. The only iffy item we ever got was a whole roasted duck for Thanksgiving. The kids were scared of it, then everyone got sick after eating it. Just a fluke I guess, since we've never had issues before.  As long as you are ok with the open air restaurant and sometimes the noise that comes with it, you will not be disappointed by the great offerings at Mekong.

This is my first time at 910live, here to see a concert. Cool idea for an outdoor venue. Feels like my backyard. Not liking how we were duped tonight, however.  I paid premium for the "VIP" ticket package, which included 2 free drinks, your ticket, front row at the show and a commemorative pass. The doors first said that they opened at 6 in the web, then updated to 7.  Here is the reality... Paid $5 to park in the nearly empty parking lot. Waited in line until 7:30. The VIP area was a raised area on the side, nowhere near the stage. After complaints, a metal barrier was erected to make a small standing area in front of the stage. The 2 free drinks ended up being "venue's choice", which were crappy premixed shots. You couldn't even get a beer, soda or water with your drink ticket. When you don't drink and you're at an outdoor Arizona venue in September, this sucks the big one. The "commemorative pass"? A cheesy sticker. As if standing the entire time or concrete wasn't painful enough, there were THREE local opening acts to sit through before the main event. It's 1030 as I write, and the last opener has yet to begin.  Update: Headliner finally comes on just before 11. If I could feel my legs anymore, I might have left by now.   Are we freaking serious 910live? I will never attend a show at your venue again. Such a rip off and a big disappointment.

If I could give negative stars, I would. Stood at the hostess station for 10 minutes without as much as a look from anyone. It's no wonder this place was empty minus a few early drunks. We tried, and never will again.

Wok Inn is located in an old Feedbag restaurant. The environment is extremely dated, much like it's predecessor.  The menu includes Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese dishes.  Well, sort of.  The pad Thai is slimy and flavorless.  The pho is made with a meat broth base instead of traditional fish base. The bun is just ok. Not anything to write home about. Especially with the best stuff 15 or so minutes away. I do enjoy the Thai iced tea, but that's not rocket science.  The staff is hit or miss. Sometimes kind and friendly, sometimes patrons seemingly are cramping their lack of style.  Save your money for the good stuff.

Nestled away in a hard to notice spot in the Mesa Grand behind Party City is this little joint.  Not too packed, not too loud.    The menu, while not expansive, has a few tempting listings from different locations throughout Asia. Asian fusion and sushi.  Let me just say this to you die-hards: WHITE PEOPLE ASIAN. You get my drift?  Also, not dim sum as listed on Yelp.  We ordered, and food came quickly. A seaweed salad, inari, Viva Vegas Baby! roll and a lemongrass vermicelli (bun to those loyal connoisseurs of Vietnamese fare.) The selections were tasty.  My only criticism, thus removing a star, was for service. A few "hey bro" regulars at the bar kept the attention of the staff. We were waiting on drinks several times and then when we gave the check, Danielle didn't come back for.ever.  She made drinks for some people, chatted, seated a few parties, chatted... This is kind of a drag when you are in a hurry on lunch hour.  It wouldn't have felt so long if maybe I had some beverage in my glass....(sigh)  This place has the beginnings of something great. I enjoyed it overall and would come back.

5 R Cha is a nice little Thai cafe that we hit every now and then. We're big Thai food connoisseurs, and this place passes the test.     The cafe is quaint, with a nice little patio in front. If you are familiar with the neighborhood it used to be Cafe Roma. The inside is nice and everything is clean.      The Thai Iced Tea is a trip! It is wonderful, and is in a giant margarita chalice...this thing is huge! The panang is great, with the spice just how you ask for it every time. My husband recently tried the beef boat noodles (I could be making that name up) and he thought it was flavorful and the meat tender.      When it comes to dessert, we will pass from now on. The rice they use in sticky rice isn't the white glutinous, but a coarse kao neow dam that I was not a huge fan of. Mango is in season, but the mango used was not ripe and was cut with some rind left on.      The service is always fast and friendly. I would recommend 5 R Cha for Thai food if you're in the area.

We are fans of The Thirsty Lion.  The place is always clean and comfortable.  The prices not too bad. The tunes, good.  The menu has a bit of everything, from salads and comfort foods, to the late night apps menu of sushi and other goodness. The cocktails are made well, and your glass, no matter what the beverage, never sits empty.  The staff is very friendly and has obviously been trained that customer service is key. The music can be a bit loud at times,  but it IS a pub, and exudes the pub - friendly, sports-oriented atmosphere. It is also family friendly and is never rowdy, minus the dude at the bar who yells for every flag, foul or touchdown!  Give The Lion a try...or order ahead and bring it home!

The Hub is always a great place to go for a good meal.  The newly renovated restaurant has tons of room for parties large and small. The menu has many types of fare, so your craving is almost always satisfied.  The staff is friendly and courteous, though at times are so busy that attention to any particular table is lacking. To remedy this, they always have a manager or other staff roving, so you will always get what you need. One exception to this, and not the norm, was a few weeks ago. There was apparently a staff meeting, and our server disappeared, with no one taking care of us in the interim. We had no refills, and our food order was not correct. But again, this is not the norm, and we have never had bad service beside then.  Today, I had the Turkey Avocado sandwich with onion rings. The rings were plentiful and the sandwich was huge! I coold barely fit it in my mouth! The Hub appetizer platter was great, with everything cooked perfectly. I loved the crunch and season to the batter of the mozzarella sticks. My companion had the fish and chips, and pretty much always does. It's her favorite!  The burgers are great, cooked to order. The peanut butter burger was a little too weird for me, but was good considering.  The prices are great for the quality and quantity you receive.  I would recommend The Hub to anyone...families and ladies night...pretty much anytime. I also plan to visit The Vue, the new sister restaurant.  We'll see!

I really enjoyed Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, so we thought that we would give Barrio Queen Scottsdale a try.   This is a much larger restaurant,  with cool decor but too many chachkies for sale. The waiter was patient and attentive. Our only complaint regarding service was that another person brought us a menu of specials AFTER we had already ordered! It would have been nice to see it before!  The Carnitas Michaocan was plentiful, but not very flavorful. Disappointing for a whopping 20 bucks! It didn't even come with any tortillas. The ones I ordered on the side were three baby street taco tortillas.  The loaded fries appetizer was good. I would have rather had that for a meal, to be honest.   The kids had the Carne Asada tortas. They each ate very little, but said it was good. Who knows, really? The rest of our party had street tacos. Very expensive at 3 tacos for $10 and extra for any rice and/or beans. The Carne Asada and pastor had a pretty good flavor.  The chips and salsa were good. The iced tea was weak. I recall the Phoenix Cafe having a great passion or fruit tea. Not here.  I don't know that I will come back to this location. For what you receive, not worth the high price.

I love getting lunch on Fridays with co-workers at Dickie's BBQ. I think the experience is better because of the fantastic app that allows us to order ahead, skip the line, grab and go!  The only missing star is for the staff. Don't get me wrong, there are a few fantastic staff there. The guy who is the manager is never super friendly. (I think he is the manager, but I could be wrong. Black shirt?) A few times I felt like I was disturbing them by wanting my food.  The food is fantastic. The meat is juicy, tasty and cut well. The sides are great. The only side I have ever not enjoyed was the Caesar salad. The Mac and cheese is creamy and delicious. I never knew what an okra tasted like, but I tried them here and now ALWAYS get them. The desserts are nice too.  I will say that a bunch of us really miss the dill pickle bucket.  I think that I should have stock in Dickies since my Big Yellow Cup collection is approaching triple digits. They should institute a rewards or cup recycling program!

A great way to spend a few hours each season. This year the organizers got smart and put a large tent in the center over the band and communal eating/seating area.  A friend plays in Grecian Express, the resident Greek band. They are always fantastic. The dancers from different churches and organizations on the hour are great as well. I especially love watching the community dance together and bring in some of us non-Greeks! (weekend Greeks!)  Next year I will get smart and bring in a water bottle or Big gulp, since water and soda are $2 each and its hot outside! Never enough beverage. It was also cool that the beer tent had the Cards game on. The food is always great. The pork souvlaki was tasty, as was the saganaki and the loukamades. The vendors are friendly, and the wares fresh. A bit pricey, but worth it. What I wish there was more of is traditional vendors. There was a lot of unrelated junk, such as Mexican junk toys, cable service and some taxi service. I liked the traditional clothing, olive oil and honey. Every other non-food booth was really unrelated to the event. All in all, you should take an hour or two to check this out and enjoy the culture and fun!

There are not many choices in the area, and most are closed Sunday, so I chose to go online and order a Firehouse sub.  I ordered a half Malibu with NO ONIONS and NO SPICY MUSTARD, with black olives and pepperoccini peppers added.  I paid on the web, and it gave me a time of around 15 minutes to be ready.  I arrived probably 20 minutes later, and it was very busy for a Sunday.  I went to the web/phone pickup line and verified my order and got my combo items.  My order, however, was not ready.  He did verify the omissions and additions to my sandwich.  I was handed the bag another 5-10 minutes after I arrived.  Getting home, I was disappointed by my meal.  First of all, for a sandwich, chips, a drink and a brownie, it was pricey.  The sandwich had virtually no meat, and all lettuce.  It also was COVERED WITH SPICY MUSTARD AND ONIONS!!!!  Also, there were no peppers and no olives.  I appreciate the ease of online ordering, and also like the digital beverage fountain.  The choices for a guest are endless, and that is a positive.  I also like that you can "round up" and donate to first responders.  As a first responder, I think that's pretty darn cool (even if they are the dark side! [fire])The staff is frantic and clueless, and the sandwich not at all what I ordered.  I will not likely be back.

Lotus Garden is a pleasant surprise for a restaurant in a retail strip in AJ.  We have eaten in once with family, and taken out several times.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive. The owner is always outwardly grateful for your business. The small eatery is always clean.  We have enjoyed the fried rice, crab Rangoon, honey walnut shrimp, sweet & sour chicken and soups.  The food was hot, fresh and plentiful.  This style of American Chinese is what it is, but I enjoyed the quality of goods and services at Lotus Garden.

This is Mexican't.   The Mexican LA Casita of AJ is a haven for the white folks from Canada and Missouri who snowbird here in AZ. If you are a foodie and crave authentic flavors, this is NOT the place for you.   The two stars are for service. We had very friendly service. The menu is sparse and boring. You can get carnitas on a quesadilla, but no other dishes offer the meat. Same for specialties such as nopalitos. The guacamole was bland and a small amount. The chips were as flavorless as the salsa, with no other salsa option to add some heat or flavor. The albondigas soup was ok. Hot and fresh, but no oomph.  My husband got the bland, over crispy Carne Asad quesadilla. With a lack of better options, I ordered a tasteless chicken chimi. I should have known when it came already cut into "manageable" elderly bites. The rice and beans were bland and tasted pre-fab.   Even the iced tea here was weak.  Pass this place by.

Carb loading?  If you're answer is yes, come to Kneaders. They specialize in baked goods, so that's the bulk of the menu. I did find an egg white omelet, so I escaped the clutches of the fantastic French toast! You can add bacon too, which is a plus.  The bread (and thus the French toast) are amazing. A bit too sweet...like a dessert.   The restaurant itself is a bit cluttered with gifts and crafty stuff.  This can make it difficult to maneuver if it's the least bit busy, since you order and pick up at the counter, then seat yourself.  I would come here again, but would definitely have to bank my available calories beforehand!

I have visited the Scottsdale & Thomas Smashburger in the past, and come back for the fantastic service and good food. The staff is always friendly and their customer service standards high.  Today was the first time that I have used the online ordering system. The app was easy to use, and it was fantastic that it let you order by complete meals, which they then individually bagged at pick-up. No sorting food out among people! The Avocado Club and AZ burgers were great. Not greasy or messy and cooked perfectly. I was a bit disappointed by the fried pickles, however. They were the saltiest things I've ever eaten! They were also just dropped into the batter and fried by the bunches, leaving you with clumps of pickles and not individual pickles. But the fries and smash fries were great.  The online pick-up area was separate from the regular line, which is good. My bag was ready to go, with ranch, ketchup AND napkins without having to ask. My cups were waiting in a drink carrier. The best was...not one thing in my order was wrong nor missing. I was happy!  I will come back to this location and highly recommend it for a quick bite.

Went to Angry Crab Shack for the first time.  It was an experience.  There were good tunes flowing and a happy, festive environment. The staff all seemed happy to work there and like they were having fun.  We were seated promptly at a table, where our server Judy wrote her name on our table butcher paper. She explained how the menu worked, and made recommendations for us newbies.    Woodchuck cider was on the menu, and I was a happy camper. What I liked even more was that the "Bottles & Cans" section was followed by "Just clap your hands! Just clap your hands!". My youngster server was lost on the reference to Beck's Two Turntables and a Microphone. I, for one, appreciated it.  The oysters were fresh.  I liked the raw oysters better than the charred, but it's just personal preference. Both were good.  The charred oysters are cooked with butter, spice and cheese, and are served with small bread.  I enjoyed mine best with the table LA hot sauce.  I made a reach for the alligator basket. It was delicious. The Cajun fries were a bit salty, and unfortunately, we weren't checked on, and my water was never refilled. I wasn't asked if I even wanted another cider until it was the end of our meal. My mouth was like a salt lick, and we had to stop at Circle K on the way home for a big drink.  My husband had a crab and sausage bag. It was kind of pricy to add the small pieces of kielbasa or one potato.  Our butter and sopping bread was forgotten until a few prompts. But the food was tasty and cooked well.  Small service errors aside, I enjoyed our experience,  and will be back.

This is the first time I have been to this Scottsdale location since it moved from the plaza on Thomas. For a Saturday early afternoon, this place was packed!   I went with coworkers on duty, and one had never been. We were seated comfortably right away. This new place is a zillion times more comfortable and fun than the old place. The music was crazy loud though, which made it difficult to hear.  I had the Puff's chicken with a waffle (of course). My friends had the Puff's chicken with fries and an omelet (don't worry, I gave her a hard time for that one). The food was hot, tasty and fresh. My friend did say that her omelet was a bit on the bland side (insert a 'told you so' here). The chicken breading was off the chart, as usual - the same that is used on the chicken, the Fat Azz and the Fat Cat. The food came out pretty fast, which we were worried about with such a busy place.  I tried a sweet tea this time, and holy sugar cubes was that sweet! I had to have the waitress add some regular ice tea to tone it down! I may just be diabetic by now.  Our service was top notch, and I'm always down to introduce Lolo's virgins to the fantastic fare that awaits them!  PS: Law enforcement and military friendly.

I miss the old Tia Rosa. Now I know they are completely separate, and while I miss the old, I wanted to try the new. The decor is almost the same, with a few generic changes.  The outdoor patio is still nice. They may have not done themselves any favors by taking a similar name. I found that this leaves pretty much everyone to compare them - even if they don't mean to. I guess myself included. The gal at the hostess station ignored me for several minutes until another server guided me to the patio where I had a friend waiting. The server was awkward (not the aforementioned one). She asked if anyone had helped us and gotten drinks. We said no, but then she started to walk away until we were like "but we want some drinks"! The Pina colada and daiquiri were huge. Not fantastic though. Their bar menu is lacking. The chips were ok, though cold and not salted. The tomatillo salsa was so sweet. I don't know what they were thinking...just too sweet. The other red salsa was ok. Nothing with heat nor chunks...more like picante. But the flavor was pretty good. Like a mild roasted chipotle. Dinner took a long time to come out. Like 2 chip baskets long. Our server was fairly inattentive.  Dinner finally arrives. I had Shrimp Mazatlan. I'm pretty sure even in Mexico, they would devein my shrimp before service.  And yes, I have spent considerable time in Mexico, so I have a basis of comparison. Baja this was not. The rice was well cooked and flavored, and the grilled pineapple tasty. My friend had the chicken fajitas. There were a ton of vegetables but not a lot of meat. Small tortillas and no cheese. The pricing on the menu seemed alarmingly high to me. The server told us that we could not split the bill, which was weird, especially since there were only two of us. I don't think that this place really cares about customer service, or at least don't either adequately train staff, or don't pay them well enough to care.  Sad. This used to be a great place when the Sirrine's owned it. Just saying.

The stigma is truth. There must be a better way. In this day and age, more things should be able to be completed online. This is a super small office in the AJ government complex. When I got in line, it looped around the room and through the seating.  Now I know many in line were old folks, and it seemed as though it often took twice as long to explain things, but holy slow line Batman! And this was just the line to get a number and wait some more.  The only reason for 2 stars was the super sweet lady at the desk. She was friendly and patient.  She was great with the nervous kids testing and getting their DL for the first time. And then...she goes to lunch, with no one replacing her to man the line.  I hope that in the near future,  the MVD gets it toge t her and streamlines processes. Until then, be prepared for the wait....

Today we tried some different items at Thai Kitchen. I'll back up a minute and say that since day one, this restaurant has been relaxed and comfortable, clean and friendly. I love chatting with the staff while waiting for takeout.   Today's choice was pad Thai shrimp, pad Thai tofu and pineapple fried rice with pork. Of course, we never leave without sweet sticky rice and a Thai iced tea. Both of those are always perfection.  The pad Thai was spiced perfectly to order. The shrimp and tofu were plentiful in their respective dishes. For my taste, these were too many onions and sprouts and not enough noodle, but it was perfect for my husband's taste. The pineapple fried rice was a pleasant surprise. It was sweet and salty, perfectly cooked, with a little kick at the end (again spiced to order).  Though I was not entirely impressed when I first tried Thai Kitchen, this place has grown on me. I certainly appreciate any local businesses that values customer service and remembers regulars. We will certainly be back to try other dishes on the menu.

We do Portillo's often. We go through the drive through,  and always have a positive experience.  The staff reads back your order two or three times between stations, to ensure that they have everything correctly.   A creature of Portillo's habit, I always go for the Italian beef with sweet peppers and mozzarella. The shakes are superb. The fries are just ok, and the onion rings pretty good. They'll make you an Arnold Palmer too, which is great.  Service, at least in the drive-through, is fast and friendly. We come often, and will continue to patronize Portillo's.

In the former Filiberto's in this small retail strip, this Phoenix staple is now in Scottsdale. The restaurant is brightly colored, with colored cafe lights and (scary) lucha libre masks and pictures all around.   They create your chosen dish much like Chipotle does, filling your plate, taco or burrito with beans, rice, salsas etc. Everything is super fresh. The shrimp cracked in your mouth (in a good way) and the salsas had a nice kick!   The staff is friendly, though broken English if you don't know Spanish.   Santos Lucha Libre is worth a try. A million times better than the taco shop it replaced. *Note: the sign is still the Filiberto's sign, so don't pass it by.

Finally! Someone got smart and put a restaurant in the video store space that has been vacant for several years! This area was in dire need of another eatery.  This new location was sparkly and new. The service from our server was great. The food was as expected from Denny's. Good, but nothing special. The food was hot and cooked well, also coming out quickly. The server forgot my husband's ranch, but no big deal. Suggestion from me: fill both the cup and teapot with hot water for tea. I felt bad making the kid go back for more water. And the teapot didn't even hold one full mug of water.  Just starting out, the service counter was a bit disorganized. The receipts and payment system weren't configured to accept tips afterward, so it was kind of chaotic with staff and patrons confused.  I hope that this new Denny's location stays shiny. I'd sure be sad if it gets all "AJ'd up".

To my chagrin, my fears for this bright, shiny, new restaurant have come to fruition.   The staff is a bunch of young kids who know and care nothing for customer service.  I have visited several times since my last review to take out, and each time have been frustrated and disappointed.   Calling in to order is a travesty, and Denny's should have online ordering, in all their corporate glory. But they don't. You call in to a person at the front counter who speaks like they are ignorant. The person was unfamiliar with the menu as well, which made for a fun time. Picking up was underwhelming as well. This same ignoramus "prepared" my order, then asked me what I was going to tip him, so that he could ring it in.   Upon getting home with my order, I found that the food was ill-prepared. The Super Bird was literally thrown together, with pieces of meat and bread haphazardly tossed into the box, with no other ingredients for the sandwich. I could not cut my pancakes with a knife. They were probably as hard as it was to order them.  I was so glad when another eatery appeared near the house. Now I find myself wishing that it would disappear,  taking the gaggle of snowbirds eating there with them.

This place is fantastic! You won't find these snacks and flavors anywhere else!  The macarons are fresh and chewy, with a crispy exterior. The red velvet is a fav. Be sure to get a cookie cup, which has your favorite flavor smooshed between 2 macarons and topped with a homemade marshmallow, charred to order!   My pals named the Netflix & Chill, which you have to try! Basically all of your movie night snacks in one ice cream...salty and sweet! You can't lose with Lucky Charms, Breakfast Cereals, Blueberry Muffin or Berry Moscato. This place is serious.
