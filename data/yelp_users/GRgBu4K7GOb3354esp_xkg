The second I came in to Au Petit Four I was really hoping to have a wonderful breakfast. Located in the old town area, I thought that a small, family-owned french breakfast place would be the perfect refreshing break from the trendy (Read: untsss unttsss untss music) mimosa-brunch places and overly-priced-food restaurants. I wanted something fresh, homemade, french and delicious.  We ordered an iced latte, a nutella crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream, a croissant with egg and sausage and a normandy creme (ham, cheese and egg). The food came in before the waters and drinks, and unfortunately, they seemed prepared ahead of time and left to sit.  My normandy crepe looked (visually) delicious. When I started digging in, I noticed that it was a little cold (aka not prepared fresh) and that the cheese was barely there and already solidified and not gooey. The flavors were ok but the crepe contents were very flat, so they were very stingy on the portions of their ingredients. The crepe was topped with a sunny side-up egg but had no sauce or added flavors to it. I tried adding hot sauce but it really didn't make the dish any better. That was about $8. My iced latte was approximately $5 and really tasted like coffee with whole milk - and the coffee was not a great quality. Not an enjoyable meal.  My friend ordered the nutella crepe but was delivered a crepe stuffed with fresh fruit instead. Apparently, the order is EITHER a fruit crepe or a nutella crepe, not a nutella crepe served with fruit. When they took it back, they returned the same plate with a hint of nutella placed on top (my friend has already cut into the crepe earlier). The whipping cream was not your typical type: it was very dense and heavy, a weird combo between whipped cream and thick evaporated milk.  The service was decent but we were the only people at the restaurant besides from 2 other ladies who were just having coffee. The place was very empty, which is sad to see considering the 3 breakfast places adjacent to it had a 30-40min waiting line. I really want Au Petit Four to succeed but they need to overhaul the quality of their food and the attentiveness of their staff. With no customers to make them busy, there is no excused for stingy cold food.

How do you add Yelp value to a business that has already been reviewed 579 times? What else can I say that has not been said before? Probably nothing, but I don't write Yelp reviews for you, I write them for me. And I love it.  So, lets face it, you're not scrolling through 578 reviews to find mine, and really, i'm not terribly offended by it. Let me do you (and me) a favor and break it down very simply and give you the hard.cold.facts:  The best day to go: Monday night  Why?: $20 for any bottle of wine and a bruschetta board (4 different types) starting 8pm  Strategy: go there 10-20mins before and scout out for a table. Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm  What to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.  Don't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.  Best group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.  Overall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full. Location is classy, service is pretty decent but be aware that the parking situation sucks as the lot in front of it will tow you for parking there.

Lets face it, no one wants to write a review about her vagina getting checked (TMI anyone?) but as women we need to find places we can rely and trust for all our Gyno needs. This is just my small contribution to it.  I was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test).  I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr.  The office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my ID/insurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded.  I gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well.  I didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy.  Wait.. is that too much to ask?

I read all the yelp reviews. I told myself "No, Emily. You are going to try this place, you are going to eat the teryaki beef and you are NOT going to comment on the old man. This is about food damnit! YOU CAN DO THIS".  *Sigh*. I love this old man. All my grandparents are dead and I want to secretly adopt him and treat him as my grandad, or just sit at a booth with my elbows out and my hands holding my head, just watchin' him work. Maybe he'd want an adopted grand daughter to tell life stories and provide asian food to? No? Maybe? Just a little bit?  Well fine, I'm an independent woman and I will get over it. Maybe. My regular-sized beef teryaki was only $6 and it was a pretty big meal to eat for lunch. I really liked the sauce and the white rice, although I added some red chilli flakes in oil to give the meal a bigger kick. I thought the pricing was great, the food came out fast and you got exactly what you came for.   Now lets go back to talking about the old man...

5 stars for Happy hour ONLY, as I have heard that the experience off-HH-hours is very different, but I have not bothered to check it out at any other time.  Now I know, 5 stars for a place is pretty ballsy (and can easily kill my credibility as a trusted Yelpie), but, I think giving it anything else based on other people's experience is just ridiculous. Maybe I came in on a good day, or I was nicer than usual or maybe the starts aligned (or the powerful foodie goods or whatever you believe in), but it was 5 star worthy.  Why? Great food for what we paid and awesome service. Our server, Hunter, was really cool. She kept up with us as our party slowly grew from 2 to 9 people over the course of 3 hours. She was pretty good at recommending cheap wines that didn't taste like crap and she never gave me the impression that she was trying to make a sale, which I really appreciated.   Since I'm a frugal individual (read:cheapo), I used the HH and the Wine Wednesday deal to my full advantage. I ordered the spicy tuna and some other roll (at 50% off, ~$3 each), the corn and pesto flatbread (%50 off, ~$6) and 2 bottles of white wine (50% off, ~12 each) which left me plenty full... and drunk. Mind you I ordered all of this for my friend and I- as much as I'd like to think that I could consume THAT much wine and food by myself. Flavor-wise, the flatbread my definitely my favorite: olive-oil-tasting but not greasy on the hands AT ALL, tons of pesto and sun-dried tomato went super well with the roasted corn. I dislike capers so we got them served on the side so my friend could load them up on his bites and not mine. The sushi tasted fine- fresh and basic but nothing to write about: they were super simple rolls executed fine.  As our crowd grew larger and louder (Read: drunker), we started sharing with our server that our friend was celebrating his birthday and that we wanted to surprise him with something nice. Behind his back, she surprised us with a giant rectangle of brownie with ice cream on top. No candle, but the brownie was incredibly fudgy and moist and it was such a large piece that we all got to try it and go for seconds and thirds. As a token of awesomeness, the manager gave it to us for free, which we were even more surprised with. This time? 5 stars. Come at me, bro.

It pains me to be here at HH when Kona is a few feet away offering the tastiest treats for next to nothing. Instead i'm at BJ's for a company HH, trying to make the best of it.  The only great thing about their HH is the $4 you-call its. They're not you-call-it-wells, they're you-call-it-anything, so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer, so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4.  We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so "happy" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy.  Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a "deal". I think i'll just have a liquid-gin dinner for HH and call it a day. No thank you.

I'm a 25 year old grown-ass woman, and I just got my first pedicure.  Now wait, its not like I have the worst feet ever, I just usually do my own maintenance.. i'm not a 'salon girl'. HOWEVER, I needed to spend some quality time with my mentees and they wanted to get mani-pedis. I shrieked. "ughh okay, I guess I should probably try it".  I walked in to City Nails like a deer in the headlights. "What would you like? Pedi? Gel? Choose color on wall?" And i'm staring at a giant wall of OPI products thinking "which one is pink?" [enter 60 shades of red-pink-purple]. I did an eenie-meenie-mini-mo and grabbed something that resembled a normal color, and sat down on the chair.  The Pedi was $20 and I paid an extra $5 for callous treatment because if I was getting my feet touched by a small Asian lady I might as well go aaaaall the way. We clearly did not speak the same language but she smiled the whole time and was incredibly diligent with my feet. I was surprised how pampered I felt by the whole thing: Massage chair, hot stones and lotion on my legs, warm bubbling water at my feet, did I mention the massage chair? I was loving that thing so much that the picture I took was shaky from all the wobbling around.  I got everything done within 20-30 minutes, which I did not mind because she was super thorough and nice. I was able to put her tip in my card and I was on my way.   As soon as I got home, I tripped on a rock and scrapped the nail polish off my toe. Fuck. Is this like, every woman's worst nightmare? I FINALLY GET IT NOW.

After several trips to Liberty market I have debated about giving them between 3 and 5 stars and finally learnt my lesson about this place. Truth is, Liberty Market can be a great spot.. IF you come at the right time and order the right thing. Sure their menu is small yet diverse, but if this is your first time here, focus on their best sellers and NOT what you usually order at other places.  The time to come is lunchtime or an early dinner. Breakfast is not suggested just because there aren't a lot of menu options (besides their ONE bfast special), though it is great if you just come in for a ready-made pastry and a latte. In terms of food, I really suggest to focus on the sandwiches and pizzas as these are definitely their best sellers. As a health nut, I ignored this and ordered the italian salad and really regretted it- it was pretty bland in flavor, lame in content and overflown in mostly iceberg lettuce. No good.  The picnic sandwich, on the other hand, was surprisingly delicious. At a hefty $9 it is composed of roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, and a red pepper mayo. Its basically everything I want in a salad, but between two pieces of bread. The blue cheese with the sweet pecans are an amazing combo that help the lame roasted turkey meat to kick it up a notch. It is also incredibly filling, so I was able to eat half for lunch and half for dinner. As an extra, the sandwich came with a roasted sweet potato salad (containing dry cranberries and a really thin glaze).   As an extra, I was incredibly surprised and disappointed at the "roasted veggie side". At $3 it basically came wit 2 half-Brussels sprouts and 2 miniature carrots. Are you kidding me? This ain't the freaking cordon blue, put more food on the freaking plate! Luckily, the veggies were ridiculously well made, but the portion size was definitely lacking.  Not everything is wonderful though. The round tables outside are almost too small for a party of 2- if barely fits the plates and just makes it awkward to share. Waiting in line for 20mins to order isn't my favorite thing either, especially since a server brings our food out anyway. The prices are pretty steep for a "pay at the counter" sort of place but overall, its a nice place to be. Just don't order salad.

I apologize in advance to all my fellow Yelpers for the fury that I am about to unleash and for the swear-bombs that I am about to drop on this review. I will do my best to keep it classy, but mostly just bl**p out any bad words.  GCM (yeah I'm abbreviating them) gets 0 stars on customer service. I came in for maybe 10 minutes while my friends picked up a case of Bud Light and lined up to pay. The case was overpriced in comparison to other liquor stores and super markets, yet when we asked the clerk why, he gave us a sh*tty response about how that's the price and that's how its going to be and that's the logic they follow on prices.  Smart, real smart mister.  But hey! This isn't even why I am giving it 1 stars (or in my mind, a million negative stars). The next day I noticed that my bracelet was missing and I started freaking out. I called the restaurant where I ate the night before and then I called GCM explaining how I was there the night before and if they had seen the bracelet or have found it.  Now, as a business owner who MAY WANT CUSTOMERS in the future, you know, for profit's sake, you may want to be nice to your customers and just answer "no, sorry." if you did, in fact, not see the bracelet. Simple enough right? Well, this person went on a freaking rampage about how "if its on the floor, maybe someone picks it up" "i dont care if someone took it home" "maybe if you dropped it in our counter and you saw it there then we would return it" "i don't know who has it" and trust me- all these responses were YELLED at me with a couple swear words in it.  WTF GCM? Was "no" not a sufficient answer for you to give, or did you, in fact, did see my bracelet and suddenly got real defensive about it? Do you usually yell at your customers like this? Or did you think I was assuming you stole it? What on EARTH were you thinking?  Every nerve in my body wants to go on an F-bomb rampage at the end of this yelp review (which, I kinda did and then removed it), but instead i'll just say that I have learnt my lesson and will not be going back.  I'm pretty sure my review is going to get filtered or flagged, but I don't care. Some businesses deserve the help of Yelp support and love, and some, should just burn in hell.

After reading all the other existing reviews for Asian Grill, I think I have a legit sense of understanding towards why this place gets 1-5 reviews (and everything in between).   Trust me when I say that Asian Grill is a great place for lunch on a weekday. Its not good for large groups, or bday parties, or dinner, or date nights or any of that crap. Its excellent for going outside the office for lunch, eating a good meal and then continuing with your work for the remaining of the day. Its not meant to be a dining experience; its meant to be a dining convenience.   And let me explain why: You come in, the menu is already at the counter, you select your combo (soup, lunch plate and a beverage for about $5.45) and pay up front. You fix your own drink, you find a seat, blink, and your plates come up pretty immediately after.  Unless you have super-powers at eating, you box up whatever you didn't finish and peace out - all in about 20mins or so (total in-out).   With this (hopefully new) perspective, let me justify my 4 stars for Asian Grill. Simply put: the food is plentiful and although a little greasy, great in flavor and quality. The staff is very friendly, the food comes out SUPER fast and the prices are extremely do-able for what you get. My beef dish was very tasty and the wanton soup was hot and flavorful. I won't go into an over-elaborate description of the food look and feel, because y'all know how standard american/Chinese food tastes like: better than Panda Express, worse than legit Chinese food. Done.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems like Yoga has become a "fad" in the last couple of years than just a great form of meditation of exercise. A lot of new studios open all the time and they all try to offer something "trendy" to stick out from the pack.  Gilbert Yoga truly deserves the 5 starts that it constantly gets because its the essence of the legit 'old school' yoga. Its incredibly unpretentious, simple and focused on the exercise itself. The teachers are caring and very relaxed, the rooms are nice and kept clean and their schedule is filled with different classes to fit anyone's crazy agenda. I am a big fan of their 6am M-W-F classes (when I managed to wake up that early) and their 7pm hot yoga class.  They offer classes for pregnant women and children, as well as different temperature rooms and different yoga types. I am a big fan of their "donation" system- every class has a suggested donation of $12. Whatever donations they collect goes to the teacher giving that class. They have it as a donation (instead of fixed price) because they believe all people should have access to yoga regarding of their finances. They don't want people to miss out because they are $12 short.  If that's not zen, then I don't know what is.

As a former Atlanta resident and a forever lover of the South and all its delicious food, racist people and humid weather it has to offer- it was my absolute pleasure to bring my friend to his first ever Chicken & Waffle meal.  Although the Scottsdale location is closer to my house, I insisted on my 25min drive to downtown Phoenix to eat at this Lolos because I refused to eat C&W at a place surrounded by floppy hats, leftover nightclub makeup and eating disorders. I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. "Thats what I want to be like!" I cried, super giddy with excitement.   We got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.  As our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. "What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:  ************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************   As he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.  After that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the "what are gizzards made of?" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.  As we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. "I don't think I can eat any more" said one person. "WE MUST FINISH THIS" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said "I'm sorry, I need to do this"- *takes off belt. "OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER". I regret nothing.

Starting off Yelp 2013 with a happy review from La Stalla. :)  Located in the ever growing "Historic Chandler" area, La Stalla may look upscale and snobby but its prices are definitely not. Their lunch menu in particular has affordable $6, $7 and $8 items which allow you to give the restaurant a try before you decide to go all out on a fancy date or family dinner.   Our server was very friendly and gave us about 3 rounds of hot freshly baked break with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and freshly grated Parmesan. We devoured it so quickly that i felt like a cheap college student filling up on the freebies. I mean it didn't stop me from continue to eat them (of course), I just felt bad about it.  I ordered an eggplant sandwich with grilled veggies, mozzarella cheese, basil and a side of thin french fries. At $8 I thought the sandwich decently sized and fresh but I unfortunately found it waaay too oily. It had been sitting in a pool of olive oil which made it very hard to grab and eat (and it was too loose to eat with a knife and fork). I wiped my hands and mouth about a dozen times just to get rid of the oil. The fries were pretty normal and not out of this world. Would have loved to have the option of switching it for a salad or extra veggies since french fries isn't their forte.   My coworkers enjoyed their food and their outside patio was pretty perfect for the weather that day. I would maybe return to try their dishes and get a bottle of wine if they continue to have their wine deals ($20 at lunch time). Cheers!

Its pretty difficult to find a terrible bar trivia place- lets face it, its just beer and pop culture questions. So, to First Round Draft's defense, their Tuesday night trivia is not bad at all.  The bar is really spacious and has a pretty good crowd on Tuesdays.... but that's kinda where the good news end. The deal with FRD is the very very sub-par bar food, even for bar food. My Cajun Chicken salad was a bowl of lettuce with 2 giant pieces of tomatoes, 2 thick-ass pieces of cucumber, a boiled egg and dry chicken. Hardly containing any taste and very reminiscent of airplane salad.. in coach (I have no idea what First Class has to offer :( ).  To my horror, the giant soft pretzel that my peers ordered came with a side of melted cheese dipping sauce- CHEESE WIZ. No, it didn't "taste like" cheese wiz, it literally WAS cheese wiz. The brownie dessert did have a fuggy and warm brownie (which I appreciated) but the vanilla was hard as ice and the fudge was Hershey's brand, not even pretend home made.  The service was mediocre as we had to hunt down the server pretty often. The bathrooms were pretty horrifying for such a large location- it wasn't kept very clean or fresh-smelling. No, air spray fresheners don't count as 'fresh'.  If trivia here wasn't so damn easy, I would probably never come back. Will definitely stop ordering food here though.

Since my last review, I have been to FRD about 20 times (awkwardly became a regular Trivia player) and they 'revamped' their menu. I can't write a more honest review at this point. Out of all the things I have learned (and will highlight soon), the saddest one is that I don't think management ever hears our comments, the server's comments or even our Yelp reviews. I mean, come on- Not a single 4-5 star review on Yelp? Staff, I hope you're listening, cause i'm talking.  FRD Menu 'upgrades': -   They took out the Grande Burger (double patty), which we ordered. They now have an "ultimate burger" which is the EXACT same as the regular cheeseburger, but you pay $1 for an extra slice of a difference cheese ("of your choice!"). -   They took out the veggie platter out of their appetizers, so now the only way to get veggies is to order them tempura battered and deep fried. Yuk - They took out the soup/salad combo for $5.43 (tax inc) but the side salad has the same price so now if you want the combo, you have to pay $3 more. Side note: they have never served me hot soup (I ask them to reheat every single time, even with the soggy tortillas in them). They charge you 25c for extra dressing. - They added chicken sliders. The chicken is the same from the chicken fingers (which is 60% breading, 40% "chicken"). The bread in the sliders has sometimes been tasty and other times stale.  All in all, everything in their menu is overpriced by approximately $2. Their HOT DOG, at $8.50 is overpriced by ~$6 as, lets face it people, its a hot dog (its not even $8 at a freaking stadium). On the only positives I can think of are their balsamic salad dressing (claimed house made) and their sweet potato fries (but they need a tasty dipping sauce other than Ranch). I really really hope they realize that the only reason why they have customers is because of Trivia Night. Trust me FRD, we're not there for your food.

Alright, this place has been reviewed probably enough times for my review to not blow your mind with knowledge. But hey! I love writing reviews, it almost warrant's how much I eat just to tell you how awesome it is (and you know, cause food is awesome).  My experience at Cowboy Ciao was a prospective/struggling foodie's DREAM in the making. My friends parents invited me and 8 of my friends (yeah imagine that chaos) for a fabulous dinner (i.e. he was cuffing the bill). He kept ordering us cocktails, bottles of white and red wine and every appetizer known to man. We were there drinking, eating and laughing for 4 hours, and I can surely say it was worth every minute of it.   Heaven. This is foodie heaven. I'm not even ashamed to say this is all the stuff I ate:  STETSON CHOPPED (Salad) Its the reason why most people come to Cowboy Ciao, yet the ingredients aren't even listed on the Menu. Never fear, Yelper in need, here is what is in the famous stetson chopped: Israeli (pearl) couscous, Roma tomatoes,super-sweet dried corn, arugula, smoked salmon, asiago cheese, toasted pepitas, dried black currants. Dressing: buttermilk ranch $13  Since this is a fancy schmancy restaurant, the server will toss the salad for you and use half of the dressing, which is all you need to get the creamy, crunchy, sweet, salty, weird-yet-delicious mixture that is this fascinating salad. There is salmon, there is veggies, there is couscous, there is everything you could want in a motherloving salad, and this one, this ones the freaking best.  PORK BELLY & WAFFLES A fancy take on chicken and waffles, the pork belly was tender and delicious but the 5-spice waffle was just a plain waffle that lacked sugar. The appetizer was topped with an alternative-syrup that made the sweet and salty dish super successful. Hmmmm, tasty tasty calories    MAC AND CHEESE This is supposed to be a "different take" on the traditional M&C but the taste is pretty standard. The spiral noodle is al dente and the brie makes the texture very creamy but super mild in flavor. I would have loved some stronger cheeses (asiago, goat, blue) or spices to kick it in punch. At $7 its a small cup of noodles that works great as a side dish or as a tiny appetizer for 2 people. Hmmmmm cheeeese.  QUESADILLA DEL DIA Or queso-dila of the day for those that don't speak the language. This one was filled with (what I think was) pulled pork filling which was tender, blasting with flavor and topped with a creamy creme fraiche on a toasty quesadilla. Although it just was one shell folded in two, the meat filling was so..errr.. well, "filling" enough to be a meal of its own. Easy to say, best quesadilla i've ever had. Hands down.  DUCK CONFIT Questionable presentation, amazing flavors. It was hard to actually recognize it as "duck" because they place a laaarge layer of cotija cheese on top that melted and covered the entire dish. Now, don't get me wrong, i looooooooove me some cheese, but this dish didn't need it, or it didn't need so much of it. The duck that I discovered under the cheese bed was cooked well and was quite tender, but the green bell pepper at the bottom was under-cooked and unnecessary for the dish. Great flavors but weird execution in some of those component.s  SALMON ENTREE A giant piece of crispy salmon on top of arugula salad and veggies. The salmon was zesty/limey, tender and a had the perfect amount of salt. This is a protein-health-concious' dream: tons of perfectly cooked protein with simple ingredients, tender veggies and not a carb insight. Freaking fantastic and pretty guilt free.  PARTY MOUTH DESSERT Meh, not the "Big finish" that I would need at the end of the feast just described above. This dessert was like a sticky pecan bar served with vanilla ice cream and a crispy cookie. It was overly sweet, sticky and nutty- and extremely hard to cut with a spoon.   Drinks, Service and More We drank. A lot. More than anyone should really ever allow us to, but oh well. I ordered a traditional Moscow Mule because their signature "Mezcal" version seemed a little too weird for me. Then we had two bottles of white, 3 bottles of red (all recommended by our server because we were too lazy to read the giant wine bible) and some grapas to finish off the meal. All our cocktails and wine selections were excellent and had a constant refill by our server. Our server managed a loud, needy and drunken table of 12 adults behaving like college students on a free meal. He was great when we asked him for suggestions and patient while we figured out what we wanted to do throughout the meal.   I can't imagine what the total came out to (10 cocktails, 5 bottles of wine, 12 shots of grapa, 6 appetizers, 14 main entrees and 1 dessert), but I am happy I had this one chance to get so spoiled on the food and booze I love so much. The foodie in me was in foodgasm heaven. The healthy-small-portion eater in me had a really bad stomach ache the next day. Woops.

Defalco's is half sandwich place, half italian grocery, full on tasty tasty italian flavor.  I took an Arizona native here because he had never heard of it before (gasp!) even thought I believe it has several locations over Tempe-Scottsdale area. The guy at the counter suggested I try any of the hot sandwiches as they, in his opinion, have more flavor than the cold ones.  I ordered a full (also available in half, but really who would ever do that) sub with sausage and peppers. The sausage is made in-house and tasted super fresh. The peppers and onions are soft and well-cooked and the toppings are swimming in a sea of marinara sauce (which is also made in house).   Now the real challenge is eating it. Or, eating it without looking like a murder victim in a crime scene. I had marinara sauce in my elbows, ears, nose and any available crevice you can think of get your mind out of the gutter already). Everything came piping hot and it was incredibly filling at around $7. Score.  Now on my way out I made the horrible (cough wonderful) mistake of passing by their dessert display and purchased a giant piece of caramel topped NY cheesecake (to go). I was like "Oh ill put it in the fridge and we can all share it tomorrow or something". Lies. When they all left to watch a movie (~3hrs later) I took a fork and starting nomming the creamy, thick, delicious cheesecake from Defalcos. "I'll never finish it" I thought. 30 minutes later I was starring at an empty piece of Styrofoam, with the guilt of the world on my shoulders. Damn was that cheesecake good, but I had a lot of explaining to do when the boys came home.  Whatever. It was worth it.

Don't come to GB on Saint Patrick's day. Really, don't.  Why? Its simple- it just sucks. The place is eeeeeeeempty at noon (it IS St paddys after all) yet the service is ridiculously, unacceptably, slow. They only started thinking of drink specials at 1pm the same day, kind of like an after though, "ooh its a massive drinking holiday today? man, we might have to make a green shot or something". They don't do discounted St Paddy's specials and the place is not decorated with a single balloon, hat or necklace.  Seriously people, you're a German bar... have some holiday compassion for your fellow Irish folk. People are there to get shiftaced, and seriously, you aint helping.  What doesn't change from holiday to every day drinking is their food and drink. The garlic fries were, meh, cold and flacid (yes I could have said "not crispy", but seriously, its more graphic this way). Their beers are ok but the selection is a tad small. Our server brought an extra shot by mistake and she drank it, then charge us for it without telling us. She did that twice and no I didn't really appreciate it. The check separation was appreciated but after such a slow service we really didn't want to stay there any further, there are other bars with cheaper drinks and better attitude... and that's where we're going.

So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.  But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.  I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.   If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?  The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.  In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served.

This review is for their service/parts organization ONLY.  The power steering on my 2007 Saturn started giving me major problems until it was no longer derivable. Saturns were part of a GM "service extension" (similar to a recall) where certain VIN numbers were eligible for a part change at no cost. I called a Vans Chevrolet to see if I would qualify only to find out that they refused to change the part for free because I have a salvage title on my car.  I called Chapman's on a whim after getting a $1000 quote from a different auto shop. The employee who I attended me checked my VIN number and told me that even with my salvage title, they would be able to replace the part at no cost ONLY if the faulty part was the steering motor only. I figured it was worth a shot.  I got my car towed to Chapman's by around 9:30am. They took it in, made me wait at their lounge and told me that if the car still needed to get worked by 10:30, they would send me home in one of their free shuttles (for a 10mile radius). I watched TV in their lounge for about 40-50mins while sipping on coffee, cookies and free buttered popcorn. Soon enough my car was ready: the steering motor had been replaced at NO COST (No thanks to you, Van of Chevrolet on Frank Lloyd Blvd) and they had even washed my car squeaky clean- which hadn't been done in months.  I was in and out in under an hour and wasted very little time in my day. I am supper thankful for Erik's help through the process and how awesome they were at attending me.

Living up to the hype, there are many things that I loved about Lux, and other things that I would warn newbies when coming here:  PROS: * Their coffee and baked goods are pretty tasty. I got a chilled mocha and it was the right kind of chocolaty and the right kind of caffeinated-buzz. I also got a croissant (because I saw one next to me and immediately decided that I wanted it) and it was fluffy and delicious.  * The coffee shop is huge, so it allows you to find a chair, nook, couch SOMEWHERE or if you come with friends you can all hang around together in some corner. The store has different spaces so keep looping around if you don't see any free spots at first.   * The music selection is quite cool and makes the ambiance pretty happy and chill. The decor is funky so there is a large combination of chairs, tables, sofas for every taste.  * It turns into a bar, well, its always a bar but you can go for both coffee-drinking time or boozy time. I have not had their drinks, but they have a cool bar setup and a large selection of fresh ingredients for (hopefully) a successful execution.   CON: * Its effing pricey. For reals, its not a "round the corner" coffee shop so assume that your coffee price includes everything from "ambiance" to "the price of being seen" to everything in between.  * The music. Its loud. If you are here to study, well, don't. I came here to read (not knowing any better) and I struggled with a mixture of how loud the music was (even tho i liked the selection!) and the even louder dumbass sorority girls next to me chatting their lives away. This place is social, not a shelter for your quiet-needs. Let me repeat that:  THIS PLACE IS LOUD. DO NOT COME HERE FOR PEACE AND QUIET.  * Parking. The lot is always (always full), so expect to park on the street wherever you can find. This can sometimes be a challenge, but they have 2hr parking on the street and some back lot, which I am not sure if we are allowed to use.   So there it is folks, the good, the bad and the not-so-ugly. I am ashamed and happy for giving into the hype and trying this place out. I'm not a hipster, a coffee-snob or anything, but I do love anywhere with great quality food and drinks where I feel welcome. Isn't that what its all about anyway?

Alright LGO. After several visits and some hard consideration, I will admit that you are probably one of my favorite places in the valley. Now i'm not a "Regular" because its too far of a drive for me, but LGO has become that place I think about when I want to treat myself (queue in parks and recs: TREAT YO SELF), bring people from out of town or just suggest a place to eat where I know most people will be happy: it has a variety of options, its not too expensive and the environment is nice but not upscale. See? everybody wins.  Thus far I have managed to try 3 things:  ROASTED CORN PIZZA This is the pizza that Yelp keeps raving about, and I have to say one thing: IT NEEDS MORE CORN. Like tons more corn, its a corn pizza after all, right? I thought the thin crust was great, it was crunchy, it had a nice olive oil drizzle and the cheese was abundant. It was a decent size and it fed me leftovers, which ended up quite well in the toaster oven. Its a great dish to share, especially if.. you know.. it had more corn. (Okay I'll stop now).  SALMON SALAD There are now two salads that I believe are the best thing in the world: the Stetson Chopped from Cowboy Chow and the Salmon Salad here. It came in a plastic box for takeout and I swore I was buying airport food. I didn't even eat it right away, I ended up eating it the next day because my plans changed. I did not expect it to be this good. The fresh salmon, the combo of spinach, arugula, basil, the creamy pearl cous cous, the crunchy seeds and nuts and the dressing. Everything worked perfectly and the portion was very filling for a salad, but definitely doable if that's the only thing you're eating. I made sounds while I was eating it. Yummy sounds. It was awkward.   WILD RICE SALAD The dressing on this salad is the bomb. Luckily I ate it at home and was able to disgracefully lick it clean without anyone looking at me and calling the creep-bulance. I also loved the crunch it had and the flavor of the fresh herbs (don't remember if it was cilantro or mint, but it was strong!). It was pretty filling and pretty great pairing it with any meat. It didn't feel like I was eating a bowl of carbs so my guilt feeling was kept at a minimum. Woo!  So, so far so good. I have many more things to try at LGO and many more yummy sounds to make. Its all about the journey, and let me tell ya, I'm excited.

The Vig has a big comfy patio with soft couches, long tables and the occasional cat napping (what?). They have  heaters and an outdoor fireplace so its great regardless of the weather and your body temperature. If you are more into watching NFL Sunday  and staying away from nature, the indoors is small but fully equipped with flat screens showing the major games and scores.   Although I only visited the Vig for brunch, I was pretty happy with their overall menu, food quality and service. The $5 Mimosa/Bloody Mary brunch special is pretty decent but some of their more signature, full-priced cocktails (like the van goh vodka with coffee and milk) definitely needs to kick it up a couple notches and stop skimping on the good ingredients (read:booze). At a table of 3, we ordered the hangover helper, shepherds pie and the tofu scramble- 3 very unique menu breakfast/brunch menu items that I was excited to try.  The tofu scramble (pictured) comes in a burrito but to be honest, the best way to eat it is sans tortilla bread and topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs. The mixture of grilled firm tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, chilies and assorted veggies is surprisingly spicy and full of flavor. However, since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce, the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty (yet healthy) meal. Too bad the eggs don't come with the dish (gotta ask for it extra).   If the whole veggie/vegan/hippie roll ain't your thing, then the shepherds pie is probably the manliest breakfast you can get there. Giant piece of juicy steak and eggs sitting on a giant bed of potatoes, cheese, beans, corns and pretty much every ingredient in the kitchen. Its served on a giant skillet and will truly make you feel like a caveman eating for the next year. Props if you can finish eat, its a LOT of food. If that STILL seems too healthy for you, the hangover helper is another skillet drowning in baked tortilla, sauce and about 20lbs of melted cheese into one gooey dish. It tastes exactly like what you crave at 4am after doing too many jager-bombs in Old town. It comes with eggs, but instead it should comes with an additional 20lbs of hot sauce to accompany the cheese.  Everything else really doesn't matter-  I mean, the service is decent, the crowd is good and the atmosphere is nice. I'd come back for the food in a heartbeat, maybe next time i'll snuggle up with the cat.

Dear US Airways,  For those of us who don't have the money to spoil ourselves on first class and economy, you really make us hate flying.  As if wasn't annoying enough to go through check-in lines, security lines, take off your shoes, laptop, jacket, liquids and the typical crappy-expensive airport food, getting on your plane still makes it worst than everything else.  Lets start with the fact that you cheap out on your customers. No food, no snacks, minimum drinks, disgruntle service. Lets add to that the fact that more than 4 times you have told me that the flight will be delayed (time unknown) because you had to "check the engines". Really? really? You need to CHECK THE ENGINE? is it to see that you won't kills us? It seems that you're the only airlines that has the need to do this, and to not let me know until WHEN you are delaying the flight but instead tell me that we should "check back" in 15-30mins.  Lets continue with the fact that added to these delays, you delayed one of my flights almost 3 hours (in 30 min intervals, of course, so we never really knew until when the delay was) AND that once  you told me that the engine had failed, you made me wait again until you got another plane, and then wait even more because you "have the plane but not a gate for it". Added to this is the fact that I spent the midnight of my 21st bday at the freaking houston airport and didn't get home until 5am on a monday when I had class at 9am insetad of arriving at the original time of 12am.  I get that you are trying to be cheap to keep your prices low... but maybe you should reduce your costs by being more efficient instead of skimping out on your customer service.

Things that make this place bad-ass:  - It doesnt look like  bar, just a crappy house on a street - it has amazing art all over the walls, and it changes monthly - no waiters, just order at the bar and go wherever you want - fast service - THEY HAVE CIDER (extra brownie points for me), and amazing beer not found commonly everywhere - great atmosphere/environment - simple, not snobby - mostly chill people  I deducted 1 star because they have a $8 credit card minimum during First Friday, and I don't like being forced to consume more than I want just because I don't have cash on me.

I'm going to take a major risk here and say that Butterfield's is one of the best breakfast places I have been to in the valley. Definitely the best one for a sit-down Brunch with friends and family.  Why? the food is freaking LEGIT. (I was tempted to quote MC Hammer but I decided to hold back, so, you know, you're welcome). I ordered a California scramble (eggs, tons of gooey cheese, diced chicken, tomato and avocado) with a side of fruit (berries, melons an grapes) and upgraded my pancake serving to their Wildberry one (pancakes with berry butter on top and more berries). It was enough food to feed me for the entire day and seriously caused me to slow down for the remainder of my morning, not to mention my dreaded Camelback hike.  Everything tasted amazingly fresh and had tons of flavor. The scramble was the best I have ever had because the eggs were fluffy, they did not hold back on the cheese, the avocado was tender and the chicken was seasoned well. It was a decent portion and the side of pancakes was incredibly indulgent- using their home maple syrup and their berry butter. Jesus, my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.  Our server was on point and always ready to refill our water carafes or coffee cups. I saw another table order some sort of latte/hot chocolate drink and I almost pointed and ordered it too because it looked freaking fantastic. My friend ordered the corned beef skillet topped with TONS of cheese, meat, BACON and hash potatoes- super tasty. Other friends got the protein pancakes (or as they called BROTEIN, cause they're douches like that) and they were a bit drier (because of the oats and grains added) but still well done. The only negative I heard was my friend's salad was a little oily, but I did not try it nor can give an opinion of it myself.  I will definitely come back, hopefully after not eating for a week so that I can order everything off the menu and pig out in a very unattractive and uncensored way. Butterfields, consider yourselves warned.

You can come for the food and drinks, or, you can come to people watch.  Seriously. Wake up in a Saturday/Sunday morning with nothing to do? Stop by D-lish, get a drink and enjoy the view. Soon enough, you'll see a stead flow of hipsters, Scottsdale party-goers in their walk-of-shame outfits and sorority girls in their Sunday best. Its absolutely stunning to see so many accidentally-overdressed people coming to a very very casual breakfast spot. And hey, most of them are pretty attractive- so its not like its a bad sight to see.  Customers aside, D'lish is an extremely popular spot for obvious reasons. Their breakfast items are a comforting deviation from your typical eggs Benedict, pancake stacks and omelettes, even tho they do have these components in one way or another.  For example, instead of your scramble eggs and bread, you can get the egg fritata on toast served with bacon and a pour of a smoky chipotle sauce. If you want something easier to eat or even "on the go", their club sandwich with egg is filling, hangover cure-tastic and pretty tasty. My one advice is to not get the veggie sandwich- its mostly green leaves and doesn't have the flavor and heartiness that we all need at 11am on a Saturday.  For drinks, I can't not order the orangina. It is extremely refreshing, not too sweet and gives me tons of energy (and Vitamin C). If you want to bulk up, their breakfast smoothie (with peanut butter, chocolate and other hearty items) is definitely a mouthful (dirty jokes aside!) but it is extremely popular for those peanut butter/chocolate smoothie lovers. Unfortunately, their iced chai is not worth ordering- it lacks flavor and its mostly just skim milk. :(  Pay at the counter and wait to get served at the table. Space is extremely limited, but luckily, many people chose the drive-through option so it is not too hard to get a table at prime time.  Hope to see your hungover asses there soon, if I haven't already....

Here I am, writing my review using my brand new lenses with my brand new prescriptions! Now I can't blame my typos on bad eyesight! And guess what? I LOOK FANTASTIC. I don't care what you think. I look like the nerd queen and I love it.  I came here as a recommendation from my Yoga teacher who was very worried about my migraines and creepy twitchy eye. I couldn't get a weekend appointment so i settled for a Tuesday afternoon with Dr. Loc Pham. I had already done all my paperwork online prior to arriving so I just had a few forms to sign. Before the Dr took me in, one of the assistants did some basic checks and measurements to my eye. I told them that I did not want to get the field of vision test nor get my pupils dilated (I didn't have a ride back home).  My consultation with Dr. Loc Pham was incredibly long but thorough. He was super patient with me, explained everything and was very relaxed at explaining how it wasn't an urgent issue and it all depended on my level of comfort. After aaaall that, the front desk lady and I sat down and tested every single lens in the store. She was so good at her job that she could've sold me a used car and I would have thought it was a brand new Lamborghini. As the sucker that I am, I went for the cool thick-framed ray bans and paid the difference. I tried to use her as an example ("how much did YOUR lenses cost you") but she had Fendi ones that cost over $400. Welp, my argument is officially invalid.   But alas. I had a great consultation with some thorough, friendly and professional people. My lenses were ready in 2 days and my eyesight feels much better. Yay!

I am so stuck in my old ways that despite a giant menu taking up their whole wall, I still just go straight to the counter and say "taro boba please" and assume that they will have it.  Luckily they did, and it was pretty tasty and creamy, as expected. I got the supersized version and it was only $3 and change, which I thought was pretty affordable for Boba. The space is small but they have a bunch of large screen TVs if you want to hang around and not socialize with anyone... which came in handy during the Brazil/Spain soccer match.  My only beef was that their machine was down while I was there, so I couldn't pay with debit or credit card. Since I have no cash, ever, my friend had to buy my boba (which was incredibly embarrassing since I was going to pay hers on her birthday!) but I understand that these things happen and no business is perfect. It would be great if they had a bit more seating, but the place is simple, friendly and a great after dim sum place (right next door to phoenix palace).  Mmmmm Boba.

Mediocre review for a mediocre meal. Womp Womp Womp  Alright its not all bad. The restaurant is quite large, its always buzzing with happy families and their menu is extensive. My 3 stars are for very slow service and a meal lacking any flavor. I ordered the "tri-athlete" breakfast: egg white veggie omelet (usually with salsa on top), side of cottage cheese and a toasted english muffin. Despite what some people may think, there is no reason why healthy meals can't be packed with flavor. Yes, even without the bacon (gasp!).  The omelet was cooked decently but it didn't have any seasoning to it. Basically I struggle to rave about because I can replicate and exceed it at home. Now, my friends enjoyed their breakfast- especially the pumpkin pancakes (a specialty during the Fall only). Our server took enough time to come and refill coffee and take our orders that we often had to hunt her down so we could finish our breakfast in under 2 hours.   I'm sorry this review lacks wittiness, charm or good writing. Its mediocre, kinda like First Watch. Yikes.

Short version: - 20 stars for having free vodka drinks until 11 - negative 16 stars (-16) for everything else in this place  = 2 stars  (in case you are wondering about the math: 20 -16 /2 = 2)  Long version: Oh wait, there is no long version. I have nothing else to say! The place is tiny and the music sucks. The crowd is typical Scottsdale-douche where everyone is way overdressed than they need to for such a hole-in-the-wall "exclusive" club. The music is meh (pop mixes, top 40 shit) and the drinks, including the free ones, are super watered down and use cheap ass grade licor.  If you already caked-on the makeup, push-up bra, gel, giant earings and 7" pumps, maybe you should attempt to walk elsewhere. im just sayin'.

Chompie's is an Arizona staple and huge with the ASU community as most of their servers, decorations and customers are either ASU students or parents of. That being said, Chompie's is known and loved by AZ natives. I'm not a native, or an ASU student, I just came here for good food and I hate to say, I wasn't particularly impressed.  The place is very much diner style: casual, overly decorated and giant portions. I got a greek skillet with the traditional fried egg, potatoes, veggies and feta cheese (to actually make it "greek"). The skillet was quite large and exploding with ingredients, but there was really nothing special to the food itself. After I drowned it in hot sauce it became a little less bland, but I only managed to eat half of it before I lost interest. There really wasn't anything particularly special: the components tasted pre-made and assembled. The prices were very manageable for the size of the meal and our ASU-student-server was pretty nice. I don't doubt that this is a traditional and 'regular' spot for many people in the valley, I just wanted more out of my breakfast.

I was recommended to 180 by several friends. Just like the reviews say, the 'old place' where they used to be located at was wonderful: they had awesome deals, they always washed your car after doing work on it and they were super honest and up front. It seems the consensus is that it no longer is the case: service has gone down, prices have skyrocketed and the honesty factor is questionable.  But before I found out about all of that, I took my car to Bogi. The engine thermostat showed cold, the engine light came on and my AC seemed to blow hot air. I dropped off my car with the list of issues, including a loud squeaky sound when I drove under 40mph. My friend talked to Bogi and we left the car at night (after it had closed) and dropped off the key in their safe mailbox.   The next day I didn't get a call. In the late afternoon I call them to hear on progress. Turns out they had no clue that my car had been left there for service, and they didn't know who that key (mine) belong to. Oh great, Bogi must have not told their staff. After going back and forth, they finally get their shit together and start working on my car. They call me and say "yeah we looked at all your issues and the thermostat is broken and needs to be replaced. That's causing all the issues". Great, I thought, at least one fix for all my concerns. Except the squeaky noise. "We drove it around and didn't hear anything". Hmmmm thats weird. Did they drive it around.. with the windows UP?.. with the loud AC ON? with the music blasting? Without someone outside paying attention? Cause I still hear it, every day. I must have super human hearing...  So they fix the thermostat and send me the bill. Now, let me preface this with some background story. I have an American car. GM to be specific, Saturn to be exact. This car does not come more freaking standard. It is so cookie-cuter, that you can literally open the user manual and do shit yourself without going to mechanic-school. I say this because I have literally done my own repairs by just googling it around and following instructions. Its the easiest of cars. So how much does a new thermostat costs? At most, $40 (if you don't research prices and so on). Cool. Easy right? Wrong. They charged me nearly $400, only $40 of which was the cost of the part. The rest was labor. Why so much labor? Is the thermostat located under the engine? did you have to dismantle the entire car before you could take the thermostat off? Did you have to fight ninja bears and  fire-breathing dragons before you could even think about putting my new thermostat on? I don't know, they never told me, and I really really really doubt it.  You'd think that after burning $400 in repairs, I could use my "refer a friend" card for a free oil change, right? Wrong. "Those are for new customers only, and you are no longer a new customer. Oil change will be $39". Sheez  Then there's all the crap my friends are still going through with them. They get a quote from here, and they get a quote CHEAPER from the dealer. The DEALER, people! The place where none of us go because we know that it will be overpriced! They have done this several times and have gotten different answers depending on which person on staff answers the phone. They'er not even in SYNC as one team, one fixed pricing and one united front.   I hate to say it, but this place is not what it used to be. I agree with all the old reviews about how cool and awesome and honest and kick-ass it used to be. That is no longer the case. I don't believe them, I don't trust them and I am sad to say that those people that recommended me to them (and spoke wonders), have also moved on to other mechanics. So sad.

After parking near the stadium, we needed a quick place to booze-up and pregame for the game ahead. We may be out of college, but our tailgating days ain't over.  This place was hidden, but my drunk friend found this place like a bloodhound finds a dead duck (ok bad analogy, give me a break). We were happy to find the billiards room and huddle over one of the side tables.  I got a bloody mary for $6 (it was $3 before noon) and our group got some cheesy fries to share.  For a potentially-$3 bloody mary, my drink was great: spicy, peppery but not too thick or fake tasting. Our cheesy fries were beyond amazing: giant steak fries, tons of cheese, BACON, jalapeno, tomatoes and a ranch dressing. The plate was heaping with the ingrdients and the potatoes stayed boiling hot for a while (making us have to take our time, which lets face it, is pretty damn impossible). Between the 4 of us, we didn't even finish our plate and it left me pretty full (at least for a couple hours). Our server was pretty fast and was kind enough to split the shared appetizer among the 4 of us. Sweet.

I'm doing my best to separate Rum Bar from The Breadfruit, even tho the service is shared between the two. Although my original intention was just to have a cocktail (and experience the new bar), our server was super cool and told us about the specials. Hearing about food on an empty stomach, well... I didn't have the willpower to say no.  Looking over the menu, I noticed that there was a grilled jerk chicken entree with (I think) potatoes at around $13. Our server described a similar special (roasted jerk chicken with wild rice and vegetables) so we opted for that one since she did an amazing job at describing it. After being so hungry, you'd think that I'd love whatever food I would get my way!  Unfortunately the only thing good about my dish, was the server's description of it. The dish was half of a chicken, with every single bone and skin still in there, on top of rice. There were 2 tiny pieces of vegetables (which I couldn't even distinguish) to a side. The chicken was spiced ok (hot but not too much) but it was extremely DRY and a giant pain to cut up. After literally struggling with my dish for 20mins, I became frustrated and annoyed, especially since every piece that I successfully managed to cut off the bone wasn't even that pleasing to the taste. The rice was just A-OK (not particular flavor) and the dish just seemed like a regretful choice.   To make things worse, upon getting my receipt I see that my chicken "special" is $18.50, whereas the chicken entre on the menu (which is identical) is $13. That's it. This restaurant is trying too hard to be fancy but not even delivering the quality and taste that a fancy restaurant should have.  Just come here for drinks, do yourselves a favor and eat elsewhere.

The short and skinny is to come here for drinks and dine elsewhere. The drinks are expensive ($8-14) but they are all unique and pretty well executed. My 18 karrots was a mix of carrot juice, pimento and ginger (with rum). I liked the overall flavor and the boozy-level but I felt that it needed more spice and definitely more ginger (since I didn't taste it at all).   My friend's kiwi drink was very sweet but very well executed and perfect if you just want 1 sweet drink (not something I could order repetitively).   Finally, my friend's Piña Colada was like a dessert, super creamy and indulgent, but enough to slowly get you drunk without you noticing.   The one BIG BIG fault on their part, is that they don't make caipirinhas. What? You have a giant bar solely dedicated to Rum, you carry 5 different types of Cachaca (Brazilian rum) but you don't make caipirinhas? That's as silly as silly gets, folks. I mentioned it to the server and she told me that they may put it back on the menu... I hope they do.

I get a cold quite often, and like most of you, I turn into a useless, slow, bathrobe-wearing, mucus-y whiny bitch. I can't think, I can't speak and I sure as hell can't assemble food together but I feel like I am dying and I demand food furiously.  No? Just me? Alright. I apologize  I knew I needed Pho. Only pho could take care of my cold-inflected grumpiness, my sore and phlegmy throat, my permanent frown on my face. Looking around Yelp, Pho 68 was the only one within a 2-3 block drive and that had decent reviews. I quickly call them, asking for a menu. They don't have one on their website (or I think they don't have a website at all), but they email me a soft copy. Oh Glory, the menu at my finger tips. I call them back immediately with my order and tell them I'm on my way.  I somehow manage to put on (what looks like) outside appropriate clothes and drive to Pho68. The gentleman at the counter explains to be how to assemble it: the meats are all raw and the veggies are separated. Heat up the broth until it is super boiling hot and quickly dump the meat in, followed by the noodles and veggies. Then, as I always do, dump 4-5 limes worth of juice to cut the fat in the broth and give it flavor. Then I dump everything in a serving bowl (you know, those huge ones that they usually use for decoration in your house) and I sit in front of the TV.  I may look like a small person, but I consumed what looked like a serving dish for 6 people in one sitting. The broth was BURSTING with flavor, the meat was tender (brisket ,meatball and eye round steak) and the veggies were crispy and fresh. Its not the best Pho in the world, but it definitely hit the spot, was high in quality and super affordable (about $7.50 for the large). I loved their customer service, their speed and their friendliness. Really, when you're that sick and moody, you become a hard person to satisfy.   I was satisfied. I held my tummy full of pho and I took a nice, coma-induced nap.

Gyro Express is a pretty decent hole-in-the-wall lunch place. Its always packed, which is easy to accomplish with only a total of 5-6 tables. The style is very much fast food-like: its made very quickly, kind of greasy and it has a small menu of all the classic Greek favorites which get ordered, paid and picked up from the counter.   Now I can't say that everything tastes super fresh and made to order like some of the Valley favorites (Haji Baba). However, I doubt that's what Gyro Express is all about. For what they try to be (a fast, tasty and affordable Greek place), Gyro Express really hits the spot. Their classic gyro is decently sized, the meat is delicious and the sauce (and added hot sauce) make it the perfect combo. Their Greek fries (aka french fries with feta, lime juice and some parsley) are freaking phenomenal. The food wait time is minimal and the food comes out exactly the same every single time, which is great when you need some quick and tasty lunch food you can depend on.  Get extra napkins. You'll need it unless you want to end up with sauce everywhere.

Steps to a enjoying successful In-N-Out Burger.   1. Get drunk first, this will help your enjoyment of the burger.   2. make sure its late at night so that you are surrounded by more drunk people like you and less teenagers and families.   3. order the double double animal style (with fries and a drink if you are feeling fancy) and get it TO GO.   4. Drive (or if you are too drunk have someone drive for you) home. At this point, you will start to smell the tasty scent of fresh burger with onions and cheese. You are probably dying to rip the paper bag open and devour your burger. but resist. enjoy the smell build-up and tell your burger how much you are going to enjoy eating him/her when you get home.   5. get home and open your burger. Hold it with both hands. For epic classiness, make sure both your pinkies are raised because, after all, you are a lady/gentleman who knows who to eat a burger properly.   6. Make sure you have drowned your burger with extra SPREAD (the thousand island sauce that you have to ask for when you get your burger TO GO). Let the spread and burger drippings fall down the side of your mouth and lick your fingers once you are down.   7. Calm down. control the foodgasm- other people may be watching you and getting the hell creeped out.

I struggle to write a classy review for Noche de Gourmet 2012. Not because the event itself wasn't classy- trust me. Everyone there was decked out in their tightest cocktail dress, swankiest shoes and more 'bling' than a rap music video. The Wrigley mansion itself is meticulously perfected to prevent any girl with giant heels to walk correctly anywhere thus increasing the appearance of being extremely alcohol-induced.   No, i'm not making fun of the people at Noche de Gourmet. This is a personal report.  Noche de Gourmet was so loaded up with unlimited booze that it went from a fancy cocktail hour to a really f-ed up Prom... and I mean that it the nicest way possible. At every corner there was either a beer/wine stand, a full bar, a Macallan Whiskey tasting, a Cruz tequila table or some server handing out bubbly. Strangely enough, only people with the VIP ($250/ticket) could order liquor at the bar instead of beer/wine, but that instruction didn't seem to transcend very far with the bartenders and servers- and for that, I am thankful.  Food wise, it was the epitome of indulgent. Although there were many many amazing restaurants, a whole week after the event I can only remember the top of the night: miniature cupcakes, boeuf bourguignon and mashed potatoes and the 4325 grape leaves (and baklava) I ate at Pita Jungle. Dear Pita Jungle, I ate your entire booth. I'm sorry. I regret nothing.   And then there was the dancing. Oh boy. I think this is what I call the "downturn" of the evening. See, after eating a months' worth of food and enough booze to tranquilize a horse, there is nothing left to do but to dance (and possibly look like an idiot while doing it). The band was very classy and adult-like when the event started, but as they got closer and closer to end time they started busting all their best songs, with the occasional DJ break. If you haven't seen a girl in giant heels bust out the horse-riding dance to Gangnam Style, then you clearly have not met me.  So why is writing a classy review to Noche de Gourmet so difficult? Because when you are attending a $150/person all-you-can-eat-and-DRINK event, there is no way in hell the night is going to end classy. But as long as its tasty, fun and with good company, who gives a rats ass about classy anyway?

Food = 4 stars Place = 5 stars              Service = 4 stars  I REALLY like this place. It looks super classy inside and the deco on both floors is amazing. The best part? It is waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than it looks. We had $5 martinis (perfectly made), $9 pizzas and $8-11 sandwiches.  Let me explain. The pizzas CANNOT be eaten by 1 person (and trust me, I can eat, and I refuse to not finish my plate). So, you HAVE to share this pizza, which makes it $4.50 per person and you end up REALLY FULL after eating 1/2 of it. The margarita and the quattro (4 cheese) were absolutely amazing: thing crust, fresh ingredients and lots of flavor.  We also all split onion strings and a cauliflower appetizers, so between 4 people it only came down to $3 per person for both appetizers.  Complete success. Will definitely return and try their desserts. What an awesome place. Too bad I had to spend it with a douche next to me, but I made my best effort to focus on the food and the other people there, and my experience was still 4 starts-worthy (and that says a lot, cause the dude was a biiiiiig douche).

This pizza is definitely better than your regular takeout or delivery (domino's, pizza-hut, the works). I ordered the:   - artichoke, tomato & basil pizza: really fresh, huge artichoke pieces and nice overall flavor. Does not taste that well when its reheated because you need to eat the veggies fresh, but definitely awesome right off the oven.   - sausage, peperoni and cheese pizza: super meaty, super flavorful and just as awesome when you reheated 2 days later. the pieces of mozzarella are whole (large thick slices) and fresh, not the shredded crap that you get elsewhere. full of pieces of sausage and peperoni, FRIGGING GOOD.   - the antipasto (fresh mozzarella, salami, olives, peppers, fresh basil and bread): the kalamata olives were really nice, the basil leaves were fresh and the peppers were cooked and had a garlicky taste. the huge slabs of mozzarella were fresh and went well when you added some extra virgin olive oil to it.   - canolis: BEST CANOLIS EVER. Super creamy, super crunchy, this dessert made me giggle with happiness.   - tiramisu: it was tasty (not the best, but definitely good). the cake part was moist and the cream was good but it lacked the liquor taste to it at the end.   Overall, good food and a great alternative to regular pizza. The pizzas here are never greasy, your hands (or the cardboard) never end up "oily-shiny" and it actually feels like its good for you. weird.

On the first Wednesday of every month starting at 10pm, Posh rolls out their "Japanese Street Eats" improvisational cuisine: a unique night were foodies can come and try "cheap" common street foods with the fancy and quirky Posh twist. After 4 months of not being able to attend (schedule, last minute changes, etc), my group of 6 and I finally made it here.  The street eats Wednesday is every frugal foodies dream: a chance to try a $$$$ restaurant at a budget I can afford and really determine if I want to come back and spend my entire salary on a regular night here. It makes me feel fancy without having to be scared about my bank account later, and you know, late night food is always so damn delicious.   But yet, here  I am, being one of the few douches that is giving Posh a 3 star review. What about my experience could have possibly made this place just OK in my book? A combination of poor execution, terrible service and unimpressive flavors.  Now not everything is terrible. I actually quite enjoyed my Goma Ramen, served with an additional soft egg. Having the egg in the soup should not be an "extra" add on but an important component of the soup: opening the egg and letting the yolk flow out allows the broth to become creamier and elevate the entire flavors of the dish. The base broth of the Goma Ramen was pretty mild and tasty, but the Shoyu broth literally tasted like watered down soy sauce: a dark water full of salt. My Goma had great pork belly pieces and the piece of pepper was crunchy  and a little spicy, while the Bok Choy was waay overcooked and placed like a large piece, impossible to eat even with my best chopstick skills. I enjoyed the thicker ramen noodles and I did not hesitate to add some squeezed limes to my soup, regardless of my server's strong disagreement for my order.  Then Posh decided to inaugurate the internet-crazed new invention: the Ramen burger. For those of you unaware of the newest cronut replacement, the ramen burger replaces the regular buns on a burger with cooked, egg-added and fried-into-patties ramen noodles. At $15 we were all excited to give this craze a shot, so much so that 4 of us got the burger and the remaining 3 stuck to the soup.  The famed Ramen burger was about the size of a large slider, using a fried scallop in lieu of a beef patty. The concoction was served alongside a small potato salad which my friend's were raving about. Unfortunately, those 4 cooked pieces of potatoes were better than the star of the dish itself: the ramen buns were oily, the scallop was overcooked and the thickness of it was not consistent between the diners at our table. The famous ramen burger fell short and left our peers ready to make a McDonalds run. I shared some of my ramen with them and that kept them content for the remainder of the evening.  Maybe harder to accept the fact that our pent up excitement about this place had died down, was the sad realization that the service was below awful. We kept looking around for our server, had to keep reminding him to bring us more water (about 4 times when we were lucky enough to see him near our table) and had to send our requests more than once before we could get it. I saw another server passed by and exchanged glances, having her clearly see me and hear "excuse me can we get some more water please?". She smiled back and kept walking. Hey, Thanks. Even worse than that, our soups came out but we had to wait about 5-10mins before the ramen burgers came out, leaving our burger eaters there waiting while we already had our food. One burger didn't come out for 30mins. We later found out that it was because they had miscalculated the orders and had ran out of the prepped food to make his burger. Understandable mistake but maybe he should have told him as soon as the mistake was identified and not 30mins later when his food arrived (and we were already done eating ours). They didn't charge him for the burger, thankfully, as he didn't quite enjoy the taste of it when it finally came.  So, is there any silver lining with Posh? Absolutely. Two of our peers have attended Posh on a regular night and truly loved it. Unfortunately, their street eats disappointed and makes foodies like me worried about spending more cash at a place that fell so short from expectations.

I drank the 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden by myself. Like a boss. The only challenge was actually LIFTING the 34oz pitcher.... which was a struggle.  I liked Cornish Pasty Co because its simple: pastys, beer and a couple of sides. No worries if you're vegetarian or pescatarian or whatever the hell you're in to these days (seriously people!)  they have every kind of pasty you want, and all delicious.  I got the sheppard's pie with the traditional fillings (mash potatoes, gound beef, peas and carrots) and gravy dipping sauce.    Mmmmmmm, the delicious taste of an English heart attack.  The pasty was decent in size (filling enough for a whole meal for sure), came piping hot and had great flavor. The gravy dipping sauce was the best and they should probably put waaaaay more of it on your plate than the small cup you get with your pasty. Add some side orders of their chips (garlic and jalapeno please) and you've got yourself a manly meal.   For those into decor: this place has it. Very simple style, candle-lit and long tables, almost picnic-style. Easy, simple, down to earth. I don't need more than that.  5 stars all around. Did I mention that I finished my 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden? Like a Boss? Really, I did.

I must confess that I was pretty hesitant to try this place. I mean come on, a chain Mediterranean restaurant sounds extremely far from legit. I like my ethnic food like I like my bars- small, hidden and full of funky people. Pita Jungle looked like the equivalent of Spaghetti factory for Italian food or the freakin Rainforest Cafe.  Rant aside, I was happy to be somewhat convinced otherwise. Don't get me wrong, their food and overall flavors are still very Americanized. HOWEVER- they are super super tasty and worth going for even tho its not 100% ethnic.   Hear me out. Pita Jungle is really a vegetarian's dream- and I'm not even vegetarian myself. Go and just order their appetizers and side dishes, they are good enough to make up a fantastic meal. The baba ganoush (eggplant hummus) had the smoky eggplant flavor i look for and it was very creamy and soft. Their side of lentils and rice is pretty abundant (for a $3 side dish) and a great base (just add veggies). My favorite though is their side of cauliflowers with tahini sauce and caramelized onions. Beware though, the cauliflower may be perfectly cooked and the sauce may be super tasty but this big side dish is heavier than it appears- the tahini sauce is heavy on the oil and spices, so its not recommended for the faint of stomach.   Food aside, their sangrias are pretty mediocre but who am I to judge- I'm the idiot ordering sangria at a Mediterranean restaurant. Overall though, its a great place to go when you want to spoil yourself (by going out) but still eat somewhat healthy, or at least to pretend like you COULD eat health... you know, if you actually wanted to.

I know this isn't very 'Zen' of me, but  Holy shit this place is amazing.   Why? Let me count THE WAYS! The location is quiet and the venue is just incredibly spa-like and gorgeous. The yoga room is huge, completely covered in mirrors and lightly illuminated with white Christmas lights. The floor is rubber (like a basketball court) which is super comfy for yoga poses. The bathrooms are roomy and super clean - including showers and open lockers to store your stuff. The closets are stuffed with accessories that you can borrow for class, and the decor of the entire place is incredibly modern, spot-on clean, warm and welcoming.  My Deva Flow class was super enjoyable. The music was incredibly non-yoga traditional. Think Sia, Madonna and Ellie Goulding (very much like lounge music with a beat). The teacher was rough but very focused on showing us how to improve our poses and extremely hands-on with us- a little weird at first but you get used to it. The outside assistant was very nice and professional. Everything began and ended on time and flowed thoroughly.  I can't comment on the pricing since I discovered them through Groupon, but I would definitely become a regular here if it is not too expensive. With the space that they have, I can imagine Bikram Yoga being amazing here. Fingers crossed...

Yet another trivia place, Stadium Club is a very standard sports bar with Friday 6:30pm trivia and 4-7 Happy Hour. Doing a Friday Trivia at Happy Hour is probably not the best idea ever, since you have the March Maddness crowd mixed in with the HH crowd mixed in with trivia fans trying to listen microphoned questions at maximum volume: a little too much of everything is not good at all.  Still I enjoyed the trivia, and the $1 off 32oz beers (at $5 each) is pretty enjoyable. For such a busy night I thought our server was attentive enough and that the general services (bar areas, bathrooms) were decent.  Trivia aside, Stadium Club doesn't really have a whole lot to offer. Yes I love having TVs around to watch UM get their asses kicked and screw my bracket (*sad face*) but it doesn't seem as great when the food is just not up to par. The giant plate of nachos (with both beef and chicken) managed to have absolutely no flavor: tasteless retried beans (reminding of baby food) with sliced jalapenos and overcooked meat. Yeah, its bar food.. but not the good kind of bar food. The pretzels were a mixture of good and bad: the bread itself was soft and well cooked but the overload of salt and the cheap tasteless cheese dipping sauce made the whole combo worthless.  I didn't have a horrible experience because after all, its really hard to F up beer and trivia, but Yelp says it best "Meh, I've experienced better". Sorry yo.

The short: This place was so bad that at 1st place in trivia, we didn't want to win again so we wouldn't feel forced to return with a $25 gift certificate.  The Long: I looked at this place and saw 2 $$ signs, 48 reviews and an average of 3 stars. I thought, "either this place is on the verge of falling apart, or Yelpers have been really mean". Well, Yelpers don't lie- after arriving there and seeing a huge place nicely decorated and with an interesting menu, I was like "pshh no way this is a 3 star average, it looks GREAT!". By the end of the night, I was ready to run out the door.  What sucked so much? Oh, let me count the ways!  The Service: Bless your heart, Ryan the line cook. The waitress assigned to our area was so overwhelmed by a full house that it looked like her brain was going through a short circuit. Either the restaurant didn't get enough servers to cover all tables during trivia hour or this girl was new at her job. Either way, she was so blank-faced when I asked her for extra chairs that I knew she might not be the best to serve us. Eventually the line cook came to let us know that he would be helping to serve our table because the other lady had lost her last brain cell. He asked us to repeat our orders about 3 times because he kept forgetting to write them down. But that's ok, Ryan the line cook, your job isn't to serve, so you did the best you could.  The Food: (1) The pretzel bites were not made out of pretzel dough but pizza dough instead. Its side order of beer cheese was pretty tasty but a little side of mustard would've been needed for actual pretzels. (2) The nachos were a disappointing plate of cold flaccid tortillas with congealed cheese and a cold topping of olives, tomatoes and jalapeno slices. It had basically been made hours in advance and left to cool off and then topped with veggies in the last minute, very un-nacho worthy. (3) the sausage plate was the most disgusting piece of meat i've ever shoved in my mouth. I couldn't tell which one was the brat, the Italian sausage and the spicy sausage, they all tasted different shades of gross and gave me a gag reflex at $8.50. (4) The chicken tenders were not fully identified as chicken, as we discovered a weird piece of over-fried meat that very much tasted like FISH. Something tells me they fry them together in the same basket, which sucks for us non-fish lovers, or even those that are actually allergic. Their fries were double fried, once hours/days before and the other one right before, to kill all remaining flavor of potato. (5) Their beer. Sorry yo, the oatmeal stout had no flavor.   The Space: Good for you for filling the place up on trivia night, but if people are there to participate at trivia, you might want to improve your sound system. Placed to sit in the patio (as no other spot was available) we couldn't hear a single thing, while the sound indoors was absolutely BLASTING. An extra cheapo speaker in the patio would have been wonderful, because every time the bus or tram passed by, we couldn't even hear our own thoughts, let alone the trivia questions.  So at the end, it IS in fact true that those Yelpers were wrong about their 3 star average. Electric Brewpub isn't more than 2 stars. I came, I saw, I ate, and I regretted all the above. Sorry Yelp, I thought it would be better, I really really reaaaaaaally did.

I mentally gave this place 4 stars the first time I came here.. mostly because I got plastered and proceeded to taste my food twice for the rest of the next day.   I then came back during day time to eat. Not my choice, but hey, can't pick where those office lunches happen. The food was pretty MEH.. my vegetarian friends were pretty disappointed when they saw the veggie tacos (they don't even use tortilla shells, they use jicama which is soft and WET). nothing special.. you can get better Mexican at Taco Bell.   Side note about Sandbar... the staff (waitresses/bartedners,etc) are all very hot.. but that guido-style attire with really tight tshirts, massive amounts of gel in your hair and bad-boy attitude doesn't really make me love to look at you.. I'm just sayin'

Came back only for drinks. Got plastered again and harassed some male bar tenders.  It looks like we're back to 4 starts again! Epic win.

I was researching around for a cheap oil change place and my roommate recommended this place. The reviews looked great and they had discounts on yelp ($20 just by saying that you saw the deal) or facebook. They are open until 5:30 so I went there at 4:45 to get service. Since they were already booked, I said "no problem" and agreed to come in the morning.   I drove home and when I turned my car off I discovered that my key was stuck (ignition lock switch valves were funky again). Damnit. I called Jasen (who I talked at the shop) and asked if they did that kind of repairs and if i could run back there and drop off my car. He said yes, so off I went.  They open at 7am, and by 7:30, Jasen had already called me letting me know that the issue was indeed the ignition lock switch. But here's the best part: instead of replacing the part, he told me that he could just bypass the switch in the system, thus only charging me for labor vs a new part, labor, etc. By 8:30 my car was ready: ignition issue fixed, oil change, tire rotation, etc. Total? $130.  When I came back Jasen recognized me and was super nice. He even recommended me to someone that can do my keyless entry for me (something i've been meaning to get done for a whiiiileee now but have procrastinated). The quote his friend gave me was lower than the 10 places i researched on Yelp. Baller.  I really loved the team at Ron's tire center. Super honest, incredibly nice and fast. It makes the ridiculously nuisance of getting car fixes a whole lot easier, and considerably cheaper.

Such a pretty restaurant with such badly prepared food.  My pulled porked sandwich had VERY little pork (2 chunks, not pulled), hard as a rock, flavorless. The coleslaw was also flavorless and did not taste fresh. They served me my food after 1 min of ordering... so i know they didnt make it fresh.   It tasted like pure bread with a hint of "other-stuff" in there. its a shame too, cause i love pulled pork sandwiches. The side salad was just lettuce..... not really a salad at all.  For an $8.50 sandwich, you can afford to put well-cooked pork and freshly made coleslaw with an actual salad. Cheapos.  Get your act together Hillside! Your lunch was a dissapointment.

I am surprised how this hidden bar in "downtown Ocotillo" is absolutely never empty. The decor is simple, the ambiance is nice and the general atmosphere is swanky and upscale. Read: my 20-something year old friends would never pay for the stuff here.  But- their happy hour, though 11-6pm (seriously who stops happy hour at 6pm?) is pretty decent and worth checking out when in the area. Its location is the greatest blessing AND curse: if you work in OC, its a great bar at almost-walking distance, but SINCE you work in OC, you're likely to bump into coworkers and managers from your office... often sipping on cocktails with ladies other than their wives.  Oh dear.. look away, pretend you never saw each other.  Social awkwardness aside, I have been pretty pleased by the accommodations at The Living Room. When I organized a 20+ people happy hour here, they were able to reserve the community table for me and extend the happy hour until 7pm (not a hard bargain for them). Our server was suuuuuper slow, which although understandable for the crazy packed venue, was still quite annoying.   Their cocktails are a tad pricey but decently put together and tasty. Out of their food, probably the best thing on the damn menu is the caprese dish: fresh mozzarella served with pesto, cherry tomatoes, aged balsamic reduction and toasted bread - super simple, incredibly delicious. Their bruschettas were tasty but nothing to yell about: the roasted red pepper hummus was standard (hummus and bread, we've all tried it) and the olive tapenade was a bit better, but nothing you can't make at home. Their pinwheel rolls were A-OK but the cider vinaigrette was beyond terrible and did not go well with the tortilla bread and sandwich contents. yuk. Finally, their fondue is simple and nice (at $10) but I think the ratio of dipping items to cheese was a little off. Read: we need more cheese. More cheese!!  A solid 4 stars after multiple visits. I think you can have a great evening if you come here for drinks and make educated menu decisions (not everything is going to be tasty, but that will happen everywhere you go). Its a 5 stars in atmosphere, 2 in speed of service and a 3 in food... Yeah, i'm terribly picky.

I was recommended to Ryan from the guys at Ron Tire that had helped me with my ignition issue. The lock on the driver's side was broken and I thought I would spend the extra cash to get keyless entry (i.e. a car remote) vs buying a $50 lock and installing it myself.  I asked for a quote and was told $80 sans module and $150 if it needed it. I had heard from other mechanics that my car (Saturn 07) should not need a module, so I got excited about getting it cheap. The main issue was that the process itself takes about 2 hours, so I had to schedule a time where I could drop off the car and pick it up later (and get rides for each). They are open until 6pm on the weekday but they also had slots on Saturdays.  Make sure to make an appointment, because they will not likely help you without it. I came in and stuck around for a bit, enough to find out that my car WOULD need a module and I'd have to pay almost twice the price. I was not a happy camper,  but I was also trustful that this wasn't the mechanic's fault and that it was all because of my car type. I coughed out the cash and my car was fixed. No complaints yet, its been working fine. I hope it continues to be that way (fingers crossed)

FIRST!  Prepping to go to the AT&T store is like prepping to fight a boxing match: I warm up my moves, i review my tactics and  I practice my trash talk. Why? Cause lets face it, AT&T is KNOWN for shitty customer service, and unfortunately my track record at the AT&T stores has not been good: I have yelled, screamed, banged counters, threaten to move to TMobile (and Sprint, Verizon, etc etc), threaten to burn the building down, threaten to sue, etc etc etc.  I swear its not my fault, i'm just not very patient with bad customer service... and I have my anger issues.  So this time, I prepped once again. I got an iPhone 4 from a friend and I wanted to move my info and get a new microSim card. It was my first smartphone (I know i know, i'm late in joining the revolution) but since I don't have a contract with AT&T I got used to being bullied into signing one every time I went into their store.  Luckily, all the forces of nature were with me on this trip. The store was empty, the reps were in a good mood and at no point in time did they mention my lack-of-contract with them in the 6 years that I've been a customer (I know, I have contract issues, don't judge me). Thomas, my CS rep was quick to get my sim card ready, transfer all my staff and make sure I was getting all the discounts I could capture. Sure, he was a little weird and talked to himself as well as made weird noises- but hey! wouldn't YOU be a little crazy too if you had to work at the AT&T store?   Unfortunately for Thomas, the sim card he gave me was a piece of crap and started failing on the spot. He had to get me a new one and re-do the whole data transfer. The whole transaction took me like 30mins at the store, equally painful for me and him but I left a happy customer- no contracts, slightly higher monthly pay and a new working phone with most of my data transferred.   This might have been the ONLY positive trip to an AT&T store I have ever had in my entire life. Good job Thomas, good job.

I had a damn good time here thanks to the weird-ass people that frequent this bar.  People-watching FTW! hell yeah!  So, you hear "rock and roll biker bar", "girls dancing on poles" and "coyote ugly-style bar" and you're like TAKE ME RIGHT NOW, right?  Well, it had that..... it also had 99% male crowd. The 1% leftover was composed of the other 2 girls that I saw there, me, and the female staff/bar dancers/bartenders. Theres nothing creeper than 40 year-old men at the bar, by themselves, dancing while the oogle the girls while they hold (no, theyre not climbing, just holding) the pole.  The main entertainment of the night was composed of 3 people right in front of me: a dude (not attractive, but no uglo either) was getting his face eaten by this girl (who we see later, shes so effing drunk that her eyes are barely open)  while he feels her up real good. We THEN see the drunk girl her grab the dude's head and PUSHES it towards girl #2 (not as drunk) to make THEM make out. Drunky girl then procedes to makeout with girl #2 while the dude watches them. This went  on for about 2-3 hours to which point everyone around me though this dude was their freaking hero.  Had these 3 people not been at this bar, I probably would have given it 1 star. So, Shotgun betty's, your ass was saved by the soon-to-be threesome trio that provided us with hours of dirty entertainment.  I know. I'm such a clasy lady. :p

Oh how I love this place. Let me count the ways:  THE PLACE: Its beautifully industrial, vintage-trailer-park-chic, best-friend's-backyard sort of place. There is no roof, no windows and no overhead lighting. The white Christmas lights surround the walls all-year round and the rows of pinic tables are decorated with fresh flowers regardless how many times people grab them as hair decorations. The food truck is located inside the metal-sheet walls and the makeshift yet beautiful bathrooms remind you that a lot of care was put into this place. On the other side of the bar a whole warehouse of vintage furniture, farmer's market items and games (like hula hooping and darts) make it the larges adult playground ever.  THE DRINKS: Mason jar placed and perfectly executed, they have a full built-in bar with an extensive original cocktail list and a patio bar with a smaller one. The cranberry cobbler is sweet, tart and not overly girly. The mojito is tart yet well executed and the drinks are very approachable at a $8-10 for liquor $3 for beer. Every single cocktail is made with fresh fruit, as you see the bartender grab an orange/grapefruit/lemon from the baskets and cut/juice them for each glass, adding agave nectar for extra sweetness. Its as fresh as it gets and incredibly surprising at a night time bar.  THE PEOPLE: Pretty awesome, both for the working folk as well as the attendees. The bartender in the patio area was very nice and funny and managed to keep a smile despite my friend's glass-breaking, drink-spilling, loud-acting debauchery. She deserves a gold medal for that crap. The strangers were friendly and everyone seemed very open to meeting each other.  THE KARAOKE: Damn that DJ has a voice. A very sultry sultry, should've-joined-a-90s-boy-band voice. All the basics were covered, from Celine Dion to Mariah Carey to Tina Turner. Everyone did an excellent job at background singers/dancers and many rocked our socks off with their crazy good voices. The song book was extremely extensive and the DJ did a great job at keeping the mood positive and fun.  THE OVERALL: The vibe is chill, its drunken, its party mode, its hang-out mode. Its everything you want and more. There isn't a bouncer to stare you down and threaten to kick you out if you don't behave, nor a server that clearly hates her life but is still there serving you a PBR, nor the slutty cocktail-dress dramaholic looking for her pop-collar jersey shore prince. The people want to be there and the image of people riding vintage bicycles around the warehouse is unique, kinda like this place.   No hipsters, no douchebags no yuppies. Just people. Its good to see that once in a while, ya know?

I got asked on a Valentines day date (hold your awwws) but he refused to tell me where or what we were doing. Creepy. When we parked in front of Villa, I found out that were coming here. To my date's credit, I am Peruvian and moved to the US when I started college (errr 7 years ago). He picked a Peruvian restaurant on Valentines day- where they had a Peruvian traditional folk band playing (enter cue to Awwwww away).  Now that you are done awww-ing, let me share with you that I kinda, sorta, maybe, definitely freaked out. First of all, authentic and decent Peruvian food is very hard to find in the US- different ingredients, imported stuff, not-equally-tasty substitutes, etc. Secondly- a Peruvian folk band? Dear god, this has the potential to be one incredibly embarrassingly cheesy night.  So I sat my ass down and proceeded to explain to my date (basically) the entire menu. I ordered the Anticuchos (grilled beef heart on a stick), Ceviche and Lomo Saltado. I also ordered 2 Cuzqueñas beer and the Chicha morada- a juice made from boiling purple corn, fresh fruit and sugar.  Food wise, Villa Peru is a decent 3.5 stars. The Chicha was made fresh and it tasted exactly like it is supposed to: fresh, sweet and refreshing. The Ceviche was a solid 4.5 stars as the fish was fresh, the corn was Peruvian (we have a different type of corn, people), the sweet potato was soft and it had tons of citrus and onions. It just lacked some spice, so I had to ask for some Rocoto (our spiciest pepper) to add to it.  The less successful dishes were the Lomo Saltado and the Anticuchos. The sirloin was sauteed with soy sauce which is not how its supposed to be done, The fries were a bit soggy and there were no fresh peppers (aji and rocoto, traditionally) sliced thinly and sauteed with the meal. It was decent and tasty, but it lacked spice. The Anticuchos were grilled well, but the pieces were very thick as traditionally, it's supposed to be thinly sliced squares. This made the meat dry and harder to eat, but the sides (potato, onion salad and some fresh herbs) were very nicely done.  I understand that the place was full on Valentine's day, but I hate to say that the service really sucked. I was constantly looking around to get the server's attention for more water, the rocoto sauce or even the check and receipt.  2 stars for service. boo.  Now that the boring yet actually useful parts of the Yelp review are completed, let me get back to my super corny story. The band started setting up while we were eating, to which I thought "oh god maybe I can eat really fast and get the check before they start playing". Nope. No dice. They started and they kept it going for the duration of our stay. And they were... awesome. For real- great voice, traditional instruments (like the Cajon- a form of drums), all traditional songs I grew up with and mad Spanish guitar skills. It's as good as I would find at any creole bar in Lima and that was ratified by all the (Peruvian) guests that were loudly singing along (maybe it was the booze) and shaking side-to-side in their chairs. Adorable.  I think at one point towards the end of the night, the date asked me if I wanted to dance. Dear date, don't push it, I'm too sober to go there.   All in all, it was a decent Peruvian restaurant that with some service improvements (and spice enhancements) can be a great great spot. They definitely delivered on Valentines day, and I guess so did my date.  As I went home, my anti-romantic self stopped and thought "crap. I just ate a heart on Valentines day. I hope this wasn't on purpose".   Shucks.

The last time I had Hot Pot it was in Taipei and it was 2009. Clearly I was due for a repeat. Since my China days are over, I had to rely on my friends to take me where they thought the most authentic stuff was in Phoenix, so all 10 of us gathered at Mekong for some Hot Pot goodness.  Here is my easy guide to eating Hot Pot at Mekong.  ORDERING Sharing is Caring!!  Since Hot Pot is all about sharing, the hard part about it is the strategy. The bigger your party, the harder it will be to coordinate. Groups of 4-6 are ideal. 10 is just a mess. Make sure you all figure out what you collectively want to eat (everyone likes meat? Ok, a couple portions of meat. Only 2 like mushrooms, Ok only 1 serving). Otherwise if everyone fills out an order card with their personal preference you will end up with 1) too many leftovers, 2) a giant bill  PICKING FLAVORS Go a little past your comfort zone on flavors. A big/spicy/tasty broth is good as you will not be drinking it, but just dipping your sides in it. The stronger the broth, the better the flavors of your sides will be. Also, go above and beyond when making your dipping sauce. Mix and match! Spicy soy sauce mixed with satay, sesame seeds, garlic and cilantro is a good base. Again, you're not drinking the sauce, just dipping your cooked goods in it. The stronger, the better!  COOKING YOUR STUFF Think like a chef. Not everything will take the same amount of time to cook. The meat will take 10 seconds (in-out-done). The taro will take the longest. Dumplings will take a while to cook, while bok choy, greens and some veggies will be faster. Noodles will also be pretty fast so check often. Also, don't over boil your broth! you have the temp controls under the table, so pick a temperature where you get steady heat and bubbles without making a giant mess and overcooking everything. Experiment!   EATING YOUR STUFF Share Share Share. Pass along the sides, try everything (coagulated blood, tripe, fish balls, you name it). If you really want to take some leftovers home, I suggest you cook them prior OR take some of the broth home to cook later. Most of the stuff really don't make good leftovers, so I wouldn't particularly bother unless you went overboard with the ordering.  PAYING YOUR STUFF Based on the whole sharing technique, I would just split evenly (except for drinks). Since sides get passed around, splitting according to what you ate might be a giant pain in the ass- for both you and the server. Expect to pay around $20 including some drinks.  Overall experience was fun and worth returning. The list of options is large and the quality is A-OK. Doesn't compare to my Taiwanese experience but hey, this is Phoenix after all.

Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page. Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.  My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food. It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012. Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.  When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door. The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago. The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited. If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.  Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices. The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides. My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'. At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it. The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.  The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while. Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices. As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.  I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive. With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about. Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us. Good Luck!!

I'll make this short and simple for those just doing a quick browse.  Narcisse is all about the environment and the decor. The chandeliers, furniture, even the freaking bathroom, its all absolutely gorgeous. Its a place to have a fancy brunch and dress up in your Sunday best. The lighting is bright and happy and the live music (2 dudes playing acoustic songs) was just perfect.  Unfortunately for me and you, that's where the positives end. The food is decent but overpriced at $12-14 for tiny eggs Benedict. They also have $10 bottomless bubbly 'but notice that they don't pour you actual champagne - aka its not french- the stuff we had was a Mexican brand, so be prepared to drink about 8 bottles yourself to break even on that deal.  Food aside, my biggest issue with Narcisse was the server. For such a swanky place, it took waaaay to long to get any kind of service. I don't know if it was an under staffing issue, but our server (who apparently was also the bartender?) took about 30mins take our orders, another 40mins to get our food and a good 45mins just to give us our checks. It was a painful wait, especially since the restaurant was not packed (or even half full). Thankfully one of the other servers/bus boy passed by our table to fill our champagne as our actual server was nowhere to be found.  short version: come for ambiance at the risk of incredibly slow service. Food is mediocre, champagne is Mexican and decor is fabulous.

At Yelp, sharing is caring. But let's be honest, sharing about getting the 'brazilian' area lasered seems a bit TMI. Its our private parts, after all.  As it seems I have no shame or filter for the private things in life, I shall share my laser experience at AZ Laser Hair Removal. If you really don't want to hear about how I permanently removed all the crotch hair, this would be a great time to stop and click elsewhere. Seriously, it might get graphic.  The way I see it, what AZ LHR&SCC (yup the title is too long) lacks in decor, they compensate in results. In terms of a "spa" feel, they definitely lack the 'right ambiance': the laser rooms are very empty and ghetto-looking, the lobby area is tiny and they share a bathroom with the rest of the building- which means you have to go out the back and through some weird corridor to find it. Not the classiest place on earth.  But- the laser works. I got the 6 sessions through Groupon and I am almost done (1 or 2 sessions away). If you need some context for my credibility, let me assure you that I have received LHR on my full legs, arms, armpits and crotch. I have tried every laser, pre-post treatment recommendation and they were all done in different places. You think that would make me an expert, really it just makes me sad about how hairy I thought I was.  Anyhow (getting sidetracked here), the laser at this place DEFINITELY HURTS. Especially in a sensitive area (hoohah) and maybe even more so if you are not used to hair removal lasers (which I was). The Candela Yag essentially works by sending pulses of the beam to a small round area. The light is intense but the heat and the "zap" feel is what gets you. The technician works small area by small area by spending just a second for each "zap". You might survive some of the thicker skin areas- near the stomach-, but once that tube goes near your nether-regions, get ready to bite on a pencil or something, cause it WILL hurt like hell. If this TMI wasn't enough, let me just warn you that before enduring the touch of hell, I needed to ice my ladybits for 20-30mins prior to the appointment, to get it all nice and numb and somehow minimize the pain. They also recommended a pop a bunch of tylenol... just in case. Although I iced the crap out of my panty-area, I still endured pain, but I can't imagine how much worse it would be sans the ice. I don't even want to think about it. *shivers*  I'm not a glutton for pain but I am a sucker for results, and I was happy to see that the hair DID fall off and got patchy by the first treatment. Hair grew much thinner and much patchier.  There are some areas that are still growing thick, but they are so obvious now (in contrast with the rest) that I can show the technician those areas and ask that she focus on them, to make sure that the overall results will be somewhat even. At the end of the day, I can endure 15mins (yes they work very fast) of torture for a lifetime of results, so I kept coming and I am now giving them 4 stars. -1 for the crappy decor and some patchy areas that are not done yet, but all somewhat minor things.   I'm sure no one OPTS for pain, but as women, our pain tolerance is higher than any other creature out there, and surely we can survive a hot laser in our crotch to forever look hairless and hot down there, because we are women and we do these crazy f-ed things. BRING ON THE PAIN!

A midst the St Paddy's drunken craziness, Coach and Willies still managed to impress me. The food was great, the drinks were good and the service was.... not so  terrible.  Since it is a bar, my food expectations were low. I ordered the Italian stallion which is a a sandwich composed of mortadella, capicola, salami, pepperoni, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, peppers, pepperonchinis, red onion and Italian vinaigrette. It.... was... fabulous! Surprisingly so, too. I have never enjoyed putting so much meat in my mouth before (pun intended) and although the sandwich was HUGE (pun intended), I somehow managed to finish the whole damn thing (pun pun and pun intended).  Sex jokes aside, it really was a damn good sandwich. Add some string fries and ketchup and you have a very filling meal, prepping you for all the overdose of alcohol you plan to induce later.   I do have some negative points for the car bombs and the service. They thought they would be super efficient and serve car bombs in a built-in plastic cup which contains the shot cup inside. As a lady in the bar promotions world, I can tell you that those cups are great for jager bombs but not so much car bombs- the beer curdles at the top and by the time you get it and drink it, its already disgusting.. not to mention they really do not need to be serving us drinks in plastic cups. Even after we explained how horrible the drink was, the server didn't do much about it except for a bimbo shrug. Adding with the fact that we had to hunt her down for a drink cause she was too busy flirting with the guys in the nearby chair and you have one pissed off customer.  Still 4 stars because the sandwich was 6 stars. One more day with her though and I might unleash my customer fury on to her. You've been warned, lady.

I was going to give cartel an expected 4 stars but then I saw the barista brewing coffee with a clever dripper, an onyx scale and that Japanese kettle whose name I can't remember. For the coffee snobs that know brewing methods, I'm sure you are all massively grinning. She took good care at adding just the right amount of water, at the right temperature and for the exact amount of time. There is no other method better in my book.  For the non coffee snobs, I'm happy to tell you that my chai latte was delicious: creamy, milky, spicy and not a single wattery-powdery flavor like many others.   The place is teeming with 20-something (oh please be legal) on their Mac-books listening to Bon Iver and pretending not to just be fucking around on FB while their Poly-Sci book is wide open on some random page they've never read.

I have a very entertaining experience at the Sushi Room that I will gladly tell while keeping names private (so as to not piss anyone off). Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew  So my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs, 2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard, nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated, so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices, it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good.   Halfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking hilarious. Then, another staff member (not our actual server) invited my date and I next door to the Living room, where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners. (Sushi & Living Room are owned by the same group of people). Needless to say we had a great time, but it was all incredibly random. Their staff was fun. They kept it moderately professional while we were eating and enjoying our alone time... then let it all loose when their shift was over and we had paid our bill. Lol. What can I say, I love the restaurant life.

I feel the need to be very responsible in writing an extremely honest and objective review (as much as you can be in a subjective field) since my server and I got into a discussion about how people use Yelp as a soapbox and not as a way to help other customers make informed decision. I'm rooting for you guys.  Step 1: if you are currently at a restaurant and you are disliking your experience, don't tell the server that everything is great when he/she comes by to check on you. If you are going to bitch to the internet, have the consideration to tell them face to face.  Alright, now that the rant is done, I can tell you all about OHSO. I came in on a Tuesday night with my desperate-to-hunt-for-chicks roommate. It was decently nice out so we sat at the very large patio bar which has overhead heaters and large screen TVs. Its actually really nice, the patio area is huge, has tons of bench/picnic tables, a large bar and most importantly, ITS DOG FRIENDLY! yay!  Since we were feelin' fancy, we ordered their specialty cocktails. The Mule I ordered was done with their own creation of ginger beer and it was incredibly refreshing, packed with flavor and just super yummy. My roommie's old fashion was extremely strong but well executed.   In terms of food, I was desperately seeking a healthy option even tho all the flatbreads and sammys were making my mouth water. I got the OHSO salad with steak, lettuce, tomato, green onion, sweet peppers, grapes, cheese and guacamole. I know, an incredibly weird mix on paper. When eaten all together (with the citrus vinaigrette), the flavors were great and the amount of steak was ridiculously big- i definitely felt like I was getting a bang for my buck.The grapes with cheese and steak were tasty but the whole guacamole at the bottom was kinda unnecessary. Not gross, just... strange. My friend got the OHSO burger with bacon and cheese. The bread was super soft and fresh and the meat and bacon were cooked just fine. My only issue with it is that the cheese resembled (both in taste and look) like a Kraft singles square (bleehhh) and the fries were super thin and a little over salted.   Our server was super cool and we had an overall great experience there. It seems like a cool place to just hang out and have drinks, but luckily their menu is robust and tasty enough that staying for lunch/dinner/apps seems like a great time too. weee!

Salon Renew is in the heart of old town: a tiny tiny 2-person salon steps away from Shotgun Betty's and the rest of the bar-central area of Scottsdale. Though tiny, the salon is surprisingly cute and well put together: small chandeliers from the ceiling, area for coffee, wine and beer (and even snacks) and a patio for waiting/restrooms and hanging out. Not bad for a 16x16 room-sized salon.   I came here on a whim as a friend recommended it to me. No yelp reviews, no Google mentions, no website. To say that I was terrified is an understatement, as I was getting my hair cut for a donation (so 8-10" off) and I did not know any stylists in the area. Rest assured that I am a hair stylist's worst nightmare: I only cut my hair once a year, i'm terrified of what they will do, I need constant re-assurance, I bitch because it hurts when my hair gets pulled and I check up on progress every 10 seconds or so. Hair stylists hate me, and with good reason.  Despite all my horrible-customer skills, Samantha somehow managed to get me to trust her, enjoy my haircut and not freak-out. I was cutting my hair SHORT for the first time since in 16 years. We discussed in great lengths (no pun intended :) )how the haircut would look and what I wanted, she prepped my pony tail for the donation, gave me a glass of wine the size of my head and then calmed me down while i looked at this giant pony tail now detached from my head.  Most importantly, she gave me a haircut that fit my lifestyle: low maintenance, no products required, no blow-drying/curling/ironing or any of that crap. Something that will last until the next haircut, which will probably not happen for another year. It seems somewhat silly to praise someone so much for just listening about your lifestyle demands and find something appropriate, but you would be surprised how many stubborn and big-headed stylist are out there... and I seemed to have met all of them.  Anyways, I know one review doesn't say much about a place, but I took a huge risk by coming here (with no reviews) and now you can take a smaller risk by coming to a place with one review. Its baby steps nonetheless, but in the right direction. Enjoy.

Happy to say Postino Gilbert has the same quality of food as the Arcadia and Central locations. The HH deals are the same, the wines are the same and the bruschetta taste just as tasty over here too.  The benefit of Gilbert's location is their super large patio seating (which seems to get bigger and bigger every time) with the comfy chimney outside.  The only value-added comment I can contribute to such an extensively reviewed location, is my suggestion to always try the seasonal bruschettas. They are not on the menu nor are mentioned in any way (in written form), but they always have one and they are always part of HH or whatever deal the other bruschettas are currently on. The one I had most recently had pickled beats and arugula with lime juice- super refreshing and delicious. Good to know that at a place where everyone is so happy and comfortable with the things they rely on (Monday/Tuesday night deals, HH, and the taste of their static menu) that at least there is one tiny component that can surprise you. And what is life, really, without tiny little surprises?

My office decided to hop on the trendy bus and bring a bunch of food trucks for lunch to give our local cafeteria a run for their money. I joined my coworkers downstairs while I battled the Arizona cold (so dramatic!) for some lunch.  About a million hours later, (25mins), all 4 of us got our food and sat down to review our food truck experience. One of them was the chicken burrito with a side of chips and salsa for a total of $7.  In case you're wondering what on earth is Native American about a burrito and chips, my answer would be nothing. Emersons' answer might be the chips, which are made from the fry bread dough. Although I usually love fry bread, these chips didn't work out. They were over salted, became soggy within seconds and the side salsa was watery and had no flavor.  On with the burrito. The burrito was not Native American, but it wasn't Mexican either. The best way that I can describe its flavor is: chicken-pot pie with beans. The chicken was really soft but incredibly bland and resembling baby food. There was no seasoning and no color. The chicken was also accompanied by a weird creamy sauce, some greens and the pinto beans. It was a very strange burrito, and not in a good way. The portion was good (well, all burritos are huge by design), but not something I would spend $7 on again.

I bought a 10 class (60day expiration) Groupon so I could finally give Bikram a chance. I am an avid Yoga enthusiast (Astanga, Ying/Yang, Flow, etc) but I only decided to pursue the sweat box that is Bikram when I got a leg injury that prevented me from doing basically any other cardio.   If you are new or unknown to the Bikram world, let me just give you a tiny idea: its extremely standardized, 26 poses done twice each, in the exact same order every single time, done in a room with approx 105F, 55% humidity and where the instructor does not perform the poses with you but instead talks you through the motions and postures for the entire 90mins. You WILL sweat, ache and (if you don't eat enough) risk passing out, getting tunnel vision, faint.  Oh, and then there is the mat hierarchy. Since the class isn't taught by demonstration, the 3 rows of mats get separated by most experienced (Front row) and n00bs (back row) so that the front rowers can show everyone else how its done. I say F to this hierarchy. As soon as I learned the poses, I went to the front. I don't need to get there 20mins before class start so I can get shoved to the back by someone who has done yoga for 10 years and still can't lock her knee. I encourage you to do whatever feels right and tell whoever sends you back to go jump of a bridge. :)  So if Bikram is so damn standard, how do you set aside a good experience/studio from a bad one? Simple. The teacher, the environment, the staff and (most importantly) the hygiene and smells. Remember: you are in a sweat box with 30 people and not all of them sweat like roses and lemons when working out. My first time at BYC, I was struck but the nasty smell of sweat when I entered the locker rooms. Freaking disgusting. Luckily, I never smelled that shit every again, which is why I kept returning - trust me, I could not have finished my Groupon if I had to smell the scent of a decaying corpse every time i went to put on my sports bra.  The teachers, like any other studio, range from amazing to crappy. My favorite teacher is Alison. She is in AMAZING shape, she is kind but she doesn't pick favorites, she doesn't yell into the microphone throughout her class AND she is great at correcting you, doing demos and ensuring you are getting the full benefit of the pose. She notices her returning students and points out when they are getting better, which is just the positive reinforcement you need when you are trying to get into a new yoga field.  And then there's the not-so-great teachers. One of them (Who shall not be named), was overweight, in her late 50s, yelled into the microphone, wore a tiny-weenie-itsy-bitty-floral bikini (and let ALLL her jiggly parts hang out like poorly wrapped tamale). She would come over to you during Savasana and put her feet on top of yours. She wouldn't even ask, she would just do it. As she is doing that, HER SWEAT IS FALLING ON YOU. "Oh dear god", i thought, "if she comes near me, i'm going to puke". I put my feet up in the air so she couldn't step on me and pass to the next person. I don't ever want to have class with a lady like her again. Yeeeeh.  So, why the 4 stars? Because after doing Bikram at other studios, I have come to compare and appreciate my experience at BYC. Most of the teachers really are fantastic. The yoga rooms RARELY smell sweaty (which is a big deterrent from those non-bikram doers btw), the admin staff at the front desk are a joy to be around, the classes aren't too full and the people are very friendly and courteous to each other. Their bathrooms are not crammed, their waiting area is nicely decorated and you get a great community feel that is not easily found elsewhere. Maybe its time for people to stop comparing themselves and bond over the fact that they are all struggling through the sweat-induced pain of holding their leg in the air for 60 seconds. Right? Right. Namaste.

I keep Handlebar as my routine spot because its one of the few places on Mill that has all the components I love: Its laid back, has a huge back patio, decent Happy hour prices and NO (I repeat NO) undergrad ASU students. That's right folks, the crowd is on the older/professional/no delta-gamma-kappa-alpha-Nu-Sigma side. Weeeee  Besides coming here for beers and quality day drinking, I'm happy to say that their tiny tiny food menu is also really good. Although they only carry a burger, sausage and salad options, everything they have is very well suggested and recommended. Their sausage with sweet and spicy peppers is legit: the peppers are fresh, the sausage is.. well I rather not say anything r-rated so ill just stick to... delicious. Its quite big and a great snack when you are having beers and cocktails. Their salad is also quite filling and decent, but I would stick to the burger and sausage options cause, well, Meat.  Meat is always better.

Its 4:30am and I am at the airport reconsidering many life decisions (primarily why am I  at the airport at 4:30am?). As  enter the D gate I see Petes' coffee setting up and in a distance a large orange sign. I look at Petes, I look at LGO. I do that for about 5 mins (because I'm not a decisive person at 4:30am) and head on to LGO to try their stuff.  My mind is very temped to buy the Havana Latte (A latte with sweetened Condensed Milk in lieu of plane-jane-milk) but my thighs and the few few miles I ran yesterday told me to get my shit together. Okay. Regular Latte it is. BUT I'M GETTING A CROISSANT. Because I'm worth it, damnit!! Or something about being awake longer hours and burning more calories. I'm not quite sure, my logic also fails me at this hour of the day.  Since they didn't have the pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissant), I got a regular one and they heated it up and stuffed it with jelly for me. The jelly was abundant and my poor-man's-sandwich tasted decent. My coffee was also good, despite lacking the delicious sweetened condensed milk that I used to drink out-of-the-can in my younger years.  Who knew, the airports' getting faaaaancy,

Here ye here ye, this was my very first Arizona Restaurant Week experience, you can see my restaurant flower has been 'taken', or whatever other virgin-analogy you want to come up with. I was convinced I was going to miss the whole thing  (due to some excessive partying in Vegas) but upon arriving on Memorial Day, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it ended that day, and quickly called to make a reservation.  Upon arriving at P&P I finally got why the lady on the phone was so chill about me picking a time and moving it later: the place was completely empty. I mean, it was us and the cooks, not a soul in the room. Since the Yelp reviews about this place were so fantastic, I decided to stick to my guns and ask for the Restaurant Week Menu and a bottle of Pinot Noir from Oregon which was pretty tasty. Here is what I ate:   BONE MARROW - 5 stars I've never had bone marrow so maybe I'm biased by raving about it so much. The texture was strange but super flavorful and I loved the options to pair it with picked onions, stewed cranberries or a sweet relish. Load all the flavors on toast and you got yourself a really interesting, tasty, full-bodied and complex appetizer. A great great start to a 3 course meal.  GNOCCI SALAD - 5 Star I couldn't really identify all the individual components in this dish but they all meshed into one fantastic plate of food. The mushrooms were well cooked, the sauce at the bottom was creamy, sweet and salty, the gnocci and onions were tender and packed with flavor and the leafy greens at the top off-set the flavor in the sauce for a full balanced thing. It could've worked as a salad  dish (instead of an appetizer) or even as a small main entree. Not super easy to share but why would you? Its too good to give up.  CESAR SALAD- 1 stars The salad category of this 3 course menu was definitely lacking. I wish I would've tried the soup instead. The Cesar Salad was covered with crumbs instead of croutons, the lettuce was soggy and drowning in the dressing AND the dressing itself (the only thing that requires work in this salad) was like a blast of anchovies. Too many anchovies. That's all I could taste, it felt like apple-bobbing in an ocean. Yuk. We tried a bite each and set it aside. It is now rotting in a box in my fridge.  DUMPTRUCK SALAD- 2 stars Really lame and inventive, the salad was essentially lettuce and slaw with carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes and 1 small piece of (what I think of) was beet hidden in the corner. The salad seemed wet enough to hit the presence of a dressing, but it had no flavor whatsoever. I took it home (didn't want to fill up on something not tasty) and struggled to eat it later. Womp Womp Womp  ROASTED DUCK- 5 stars One of the best duck dishes I have ever had, not that I eat duck very often. It was strange how I couldn't pick out a single item/ingredient on the plate (except the duck, I think I noticed that one) but they all worked together in a weird yet tasty combo. It seems the roasted duck was sitting on a bed of YAM (yes Yam) risotto-ish with a blueberry compote. It was sweet and salty and had lots of other flavors I couldn't describe. The duck was incredibly tender and fell off the bone. Despite being incredibly full, I licked (not literally, I have some table manners) clean, it was amazing.  PORK PORCHETTE- 3 stars The pork itself was 50% fat but the nonfat parks were tender and nicely cooked. The pork itself didn't have any seasoning or added flavor, so it was kinda mediocre. The medallion was sitting in a ginormous mount of (what I then discovered to be) potato salad. It was mostly potatoes, green onions and some coleslaw (I think). The whole thing was wrapped up in a sauce composed of horse radish and spicy mayo, two things I really really dislike. Unfortunately the menu wasn't super descriptive on this so I found myself eating the pork and not being able to take more than one bite of this nasty potato salad. That also went to waste. Boo.  Besides the food, our server was really awesome. Granted she had no other tables to serve, but she was still super nice to us and really easy to chat with. The place itself has upper-level food but the ambiance is very low-key, casual and cool to hang out in. If I were to come back, I'd be more careful with my menu picks, as it seems that a lot of its food (especially salads!) are hit or miss (or just miss). I'm glad I got to try it and would return only for the duck and maybe the gnocci salad.. everything else needs a revamp.

I average about 8 trip to Vegas per year and I have never bothered to write a review on my visits. This last trip, we went to the grand opening of Light at the Mandalay Bay. As I sit here and think about my review, an important thing comes to mind:  Your experience at a nightclub like this is probably highly correlated to whether or not you had table service or paid general admission. I'm not trying to be an elitist asshole (said the Yelp Elite) but I've been there: You're in high (HIGH) heels, there's NO PLACE to sit, a small squat on the speakers and the bouncers are already flashing lights at you, the dance floor is CRAMMED and the VIP dudes keep pushing you in because you are invading the bottle-service space. Talk about feeling like a second-class citizen.  Then there's the "bros" with the bottle service booth by the stage. Dancing on the couch, sitting whenever they feel like it, random bitches showing up and grinding up on you (for the price of all the liquor you purchased), photographers snapping your picture, random dudes hi-fiving you and the sucking up of every single manager, server and employee there. What a life.  Regardless on what side of the fence (VIP rope) you are, I still want to give Light the props that it deserves. They went all out on their opening night. The circ du soleil style was very much present in the gogo-dancers, random-creepy-costume people walking around the dance floor, bottles area and general seating and the arealist performers. They had ring acrobats, silk acrobats, people climbing up/down the walls (literally) and a tinted screen where, when illuminated, showed tons of dancers on trampolines doing tricks. Zedd was there rocking out and his before/after DJ was also quite good for an all EDM night.  In terms of set up and decor, they have 3 floors with balconies so you can see the main stage from almost everywhere. The ceiling and main wall is filled with flat-screens displaying different abstract things and giving it a very trippy experience. It was one of the biggest clubs without a pool/outdoor area, almost like a renewed version of Rain (which used to be THE club).  For a Grand Opening, I thought it was fabulous. Do I expect it to be as good on a regular night? No. Would I go had I had to stand in line like the people I saw (literally around the freaking casino)? No. But that's just me. Clubbin is fun and all, but not when you get treated like shit just to get into somewhere.

Hey laaaaaaaadies!  Need a job as a server in a casual/sports/cowboy-themed bar? Do you happen to have a tramp stamp? Muffin top? Not enough boobs for hooters? The IQ level of a kindergartner or less? If you answered "yes" to All, this is the place for you.  Not only will you uncomfortably stop by my table umpteen times while our plates and drinks are still visibly full, but you'll also give us a disappointing look when we tell you, for the umpteen time, that we are OK with food and drink for now. Since you are a *star* employee, you'll ignore that and still say "are you suuuuure you don't want to order more apps? entrees for everyone? shots? No??"   Then you will show us the beer list which will consist on a torn piece of paper, hand-written by you (I can tell by the little hearts on the "i"s) and tell us that those are the Happy hour specials, which we will go off by and order. Then when the bill comes, you'll charge us full price for a Blue Moon ($5) because its not on the Happy hour list, which doesn't actually exist because you forgot to mention that the list you showed us had nothing to do with happy hour.  Woopsies. right? Totes happs all the time, hehe. Luckily your good looks and *charming* personality will totes save you from learning how to serve correctly and letting us enjoy our happy hour time. Good for you * insert stripper name here*, Good for You.

I'd like to think that the temperature was set so that we could burn as many calories as we were ingesting. Ok maybe  not AS MANY, but any help counts, right?  For starters, how awesome is the Yelp community that when I didn't make the list (really, i'm not as cool as you thought), Danielle (another fellow Elite) offered to bring me as her +1? Seriously, that was freaking awesome and so so sweet of her. Obviously it was even better that she and her crew ended up being so cool and fun to hang out with. Aww, The Yelpers bring the warm and fuzzies within.  Alright back to the sugar coma. Holy cow LGO was feeding us like they were prepping us for a marathon. I managed to eat 3/4 of the pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissants) and after that I couldn't manage eating more than a bite of each thing... but i tried EVERYTHING. And, despite not having knifes to go halfies on stuff, we still managed to share to prevent being wasteful on the amazing treats that they had out. Although the desserts were superb, the breakfast treat table was still my favorite. Well, after the mint flavored ice cream, that tasted like a mojito on an herbal crack sans the alcohol. Then I saw the chefs put scoops of peach ice cream on the champagne and my eyes almost fell out of my socket.  Props to Lindsay for having the brilliant stroke of genius to hand out those hand-fans.. but mostly, props to the dude that had the balls to propose to his girlfriend in front of a crowd of hungry strangers. Hey, at least they had free champagne at their disposal immediately after. Right? Damn right.

Buying a house can be really stressful, time-consuming and complicated, especially if its your first one. I'm very grateful I had a Real Estate agent that guided me through the process, helped me understand what are "must haves" vs "nice to haves" when looking for a home, showed me countless properties and answered a million questions since I was so new to the home ownership process. It makes a giant difference having someone with your best interest in mind that will give you the assurance that everything is taken care of and will go well. His references, team and connections helped me streamline through all the little details I didn't even think of like getting a good inspector, a home insurance, home warranty and even some home improvement projects. As needy as I was with my questions and helped needed, I was happy to always get a timely and thorough answer  so all my worries went away. I know people will usually go with friends/family recommendation because it feels comfortable but I believe in shopping around to find an agent that best fits your needs and ensures you will have a successful home purchase.
