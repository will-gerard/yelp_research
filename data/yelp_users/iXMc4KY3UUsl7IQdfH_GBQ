Been here a number of times before and have never been overly pleased with how the inside of my car was cleaned and frankly it appeared that they had almost passed over cleaning the inside all together. Yet, I went back again today and my car looks fabulous inside and out! Hope they can keep up the good work and consistently clean my car each time.

The office is now located on the southwest corner of 15th street and Osborn.   My ear had been hurting for days with what I suspected to be an ear infection. I was trying to avoid going to an urgent care and the hefty bill that often comes along with that. Every primary care physician I called in the area had a three to four week waiting list for new patients- except Dr. Corrigan.   When I called, the courteous receptionist let me know that walk-ins were welcome and there currently was no wait. From the time I called, I drove to the office and met with Dr. Corrigan all in about 45 mins! The wait was short, the office staff was more than helpful, and Dr. Corrigan was knowledgable and efficient!   I definitely recommend this walk-in clinic and plan to return and see Dr. Corrigan as my primary care physician.

This cruise was so much fun! The fare was a good price and for a 90-minute cruise, was well worth it. Who knew a man-made lake could one, be so large and two, be so beautiful?!!  Light snacks and drinks were served and at two dollars for beer or wine, the happy hour specials were great!  The cruise was a great way to spend the evening and gorgeous views could be seen from all sides of the boat.  Check out my pics from the cruise!

I'm not sure what was better, the sangria or the thin crust pizza but either way- a must see place. The owner has an adorable little dog that sits up at the at bar on a cushion! It is hysterical! I had the vegetarian pizza, a large house salad, and a carafe of the red sangria which made a perfect size meal for my two friends and I.

My friend and I swung in for a light dinner and glass of wine the other night. The hummus plate was packed with veggies, olives, and delicious warm pita bread. They also offer a wide variety of cheese to choose from and these along with the extensive wine list made for some great pairings!   The atmosphere was super chill with dim lighting and an amazing band playing in the background. Great place to go out with a group of friends or for date night.

One stop shop. Not only is Sprouts the only grocery store I can go to to find everything I need, the prices are great too. No joke. Despite the customer incentives and members cards available at other stores, I still end up saving more at Sprouts. They have a great deli selection too. Try the seafood salad. Delicious!

While I love the interior of this location, the service has repeatedly been horrible. My drink order has been wrong on too many occasions to count and as someone who primarily uses the drive-through, I am often not realizing their mistake until I am home. I have been given drinks that I did not order (obviously they mistakenly gave me someone else's order), had to repeat my order multiple times for them to only then get it wrong, and am repeatedly given regular milk when I have requested soy. It is unfortunate that this Starbucks is in my neighborhood and the closest to my home because it is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to.

Great haircut and color. Chill atmosphere. I was able to make an appointment last minute and still get in! The staff is especially friendly with one gentleman going out of his way to make iced tea for me. Ask for Nate. I love what he did with my hair!

This is my favorite lunch spot in town. I love the daily $6 daily wrap specials!   So the staff here are amazingly polite and are great will regulars, welcoming them back am remembering not only faces but also names.   I'm always on the lookout for healthy places to eat in town and this is definitely one of them. All of the wraps can be prepared as salads and tofu can be substituted for meat.  Lets not forget that happy hour starts at three and did I forget to mention their deserts? Brownies, cookies, and carrot cake. Yum!

Very disappointed. The last time my boyfriend and I were here we had the Evo salad and the bolognese and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Tonight's dinner was different however. Not only was the kale overcooked on the salad but the homemade pasta was stiff and lacking in flavor. I have been raving about this place and the Evo salad all week but tonight was definitely a let down. We were served our entrees before we even finished our salad and ordered a bottle of wine which we intended to have with our dinner but it too came out before we had even finished our before dinner cocktails. Not sure we will be back.
