If I could give a negative star I would gladly do so DO NOT COME HERE. I live in Scottsdale and drove all the way over to excitedly show this woman pearls i was given by my aunt to see what they were and how much they are worth. I'm 22, so I know nothing about fine jewelry because I'm more tom-boyish but reguardless I go in there in yoga pants and a big shirt I was about to work out and she looks at me up and down like I'm scumb of the Earth saying she's so busy what do I want, --What do I want?! When I took out my jewelry she acted like I stole it and asked me for my identification. After her snide remarks, uncomfortable looks, and rude comments she had the audacity to ask to buy some of my pearls. I gathered my things and told her I really didn't like her vibe/energy towards me all she did was chuckle and stick her nose up at me. I will never be back there again she can shove all her judgment up her butt. No one should be treated a specific way based on their appearance I own a business myself she's a total bitch. Thanks for nothin lady!
