Carne asada fries are better than filli b's.

Very good and very authentic. I had the same torta Adam had on show Man vs. Food, I think it had the whole kitchen in it! But it was really and I could only finish half the torta.

I'm sorry but this place is by far the worse place I ever dined. Watching  the cooks playing with there coffee drink while I ordered makes me uncomfortable also watching them slap the the waitress on the ass while I was trying to order was unacceptable and the taste of the food proved to horrible!

The calamari tasted old and so did the eel. Old is not a comforting taste when eating sushi....

As much as I love the mother road lost highway this is my second time here and the service is horrible and very unwelcoming for a bar.

I love the concept. But by far this is the worst experience of any of the many subway pizza places I have been to. The service was horible and the  topping where nowhere near fresh. I prefer studio pizza and my pie to this place any day.
