Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams, sauces, teas & cookwares.

NIce airport, decent amount of shops but could use more variety. Lately they've been revamping their restaurants and getting some way tastier options.

Totally great location off of Chandler Blvd. restaurant is situated in a strip mall type place but once inside gives off the Classic Italian restaurant attitude. Food is great, had the eggplant Parmesan and loved it! Happy hour specials are constantly changing to appeal to clientele. Specials available from 5-7, seven days a week. I'd definitely recommend this place as a spot for drinks or after shopping food, you won't be disappointed!

The house dressing is an absolute must especially on the Old World Classic Salad. Bottles are available for purchase & I believe a dollar off is given for bringing the bottle back for refills. Servers are young and hip, my daughter used to say she wanted her first job to be here! Try the spinach pie, you won't be sorry.

Love Jamba Juice! The fresh squeezed OJ is unlike anything you've ever tasted. Matcha green tea shots are great for a quick pick me up without the crash later. The guys at Jamba are great and will make special requests like my daughters favorite raspberry dream.

Love Jamba Juice! Fresh made smoothies and delicious hot oatmeal. If you see a menu item that sounds pretty good don't be afraid to ask for a tweak. The workers are always accommodating with changing recipes to suit your tastes.

Love the dim sum on Sunday afternoons. Always end up bringing home a lot of leftovers as the little carts full of delicious food keep strolling by. Dim sum is a great way to try a variety of foods and this is a great place for it.

Beautiful new church with services every week incorporating the Greek language and traditional customs into experience. Large community center with raised stage, full kitchen facilities and ample parking available for rent. St Katherine's puts on a wonderful Greek festival every year with food, music, vendors, and dancers.

Love this place:) Just like all the other Yelpers I have to say the little old man at the counter is the best!! My daughter is a fan of their teriyaki chicken & I love the Sukiyaki Beef. This place is a tiny hole in the wall without much in decor but the service is super friendly & the food is quick and delish. What more do you really need?

There's about three stores that have these same clothes and this is one. It's all geared towards the teens 20-something's. You really need to be on the slim side to fit into these. They're stylish to a point, pretty basic, lots of plaid and ruffles. Store tries to play off the "So Cal" vibe. I moved to AZ from SoCal and don't remember quite so much plaid and ruffles but I'm not they're demographic so what do I know. They do have a good selection of clearance merch usually with an additional markdown of 40% so deals can be had here. My only complaints are the lighting which is very minimal and directed. It's weird since you'll never be in that type of light in real life. My other complaint is the music volume. Yeah, I sound old now but seriously this place makes it hard to hold a conversation loud. If this was one of those stores where every employee feels the need to chat you up I'd appreciate the high volume more but it's more the type where you have to search them out. Oh and would a name tag be too much to ask? It's play the who works here game.  FYI they do like to use soft porn in their in store ads so if you're pruddish i'd steer clear.

Delicious healthy meats and veggies cooked while you watch with a variety of sauce options. Meal also includes fried wontons, soup, & rice. Avoid the noon time slot as the restaurant is located across from a high school. If it's your first time watch the others before you, there's a skill involved in making your bowl. Also make sure you use the papers by meats to push down meat & get more in bowl, remember the veggies will cook down quite a bit.

I like the new look but hate the confusing new set up. It's all, "I'm a buffet, but nope no I'm not!"  Ordered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion Mac & cheese. Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food.

Brought me safely from point A to point B several times. I think people forget that's what the airline is for. It's not about feeding you, stroking your ego or accommodating your afternoon nap. All airlines overbook flights. All airlines have delays. US Airways does quiet a bit to help the community like sponsoring the Phoenix Zoo, donating to St Mary's food bank, & the United Way.

I can't afford my reading habit so end up here often. Lots of computers available if you don't have access at home. They also have a new program where you can "check out" passes to local museums. Some participants include Pueblo Grande, AZ Science Center, & the Botanical Gardens. This branch also has meeting rooms if you need space for a not for profit to meet up.

Power went out unexpectedly in half of my house. Called and spoke with Preston who said he could come over right away. He showed on time & was able to fix the problem quickly. Turned out a loose fixture was breaking the electric connection to the rest of the house. Price was reasonable & work was done quickly. I'll be giving Dodge Electric a call next time I need work done:)

Overpriced small plates. Ordered the chicken strips which is listed as coming with ranch, BBQ or honey mustard. Asked for honey mustard & BBQ, received ranch. When I asked for the right sides was told they've never had honey mustard. Maybe take it off the menu? Mom Ordered a virgin strawberry margarita. It was thin and watered down tasting. Pick it up improv! Comics were alright. Apparently it was Arabic night or something, I'd say about 85% of audience was of middle eastern descent as we're the comics. Most of the jokes were geared towards their background & political areas.  Previously the improv allowed 18-20yr olds only in the upper balcony. The show we attended was actually 15+, there was a small amount of cursing, heard the F bomb just twice. Check their schedule as some shows are 21+, some 18+, and some now even 15+.

This was my first outing to a Vegan or even Vegetarian restaurant. Honestly I was expecting more veggie focused entrees rather than faux meat selections. I went with the Coconut Curry bowl with crispy tofu and pan fried noodles. It was tasty, filling and visually appetizing. For dessert I had the fluffernutter (I think that's the name). It's a soy based vanilla ice cream with peanut butter, bananas & crisy cereal in it. DELICIOUS! It reminded me more of ice milk then ice cream. Next time I think I'll get it minus the bananas though. Oh and yes, there will be a next time :)

Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.

Went here for the first time on a date. Cool early October evening so we sat outside. Beautiful ambience on the patio with lush trees and twinkling lights strung everywhere. There was a man playing acoustic guitar and singing . We ordered a white pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms, & white truffle oil, it was divine! Pizzas are good size & enough for two if you're not starving. The have a large selection of by the bottle wine & about 10 each of reds & whites available by the glass.

Great breakfast and lunch options. Love the eggs Benedict here, made with real hollandaise sauce not cheese sauce some places use. They're small juices are very small but luckily ever table has it's own carafe of lemon ice water if you're a big drinker like me. Be prepared to wait if you show up on a weekend morning, good breakfast places always have a line.

I'm a HUGE fan of Costco. Recently I've started using their pharmacy. I have monthly thyroid meds I've been paying $8.99 at the grocery store for, well Costco did it up for a 3 month supply at $11.99!!  Now this Costco has something NO other Costco has. They are the country's test store for a self check out process. It's pretty cool and easy to use with someone standing right there to walk you thru it. Basically you scan your Costco card and then get a hand held machine to scan all your buys with. They even thought ahead to put a holder for the machine on all the grocery carts. Theres a dedicated are for you to check out (much quicker). The only downside to the process is theres no boxes nearby to make carrying your stuff into the house.

Love Bookman's! Forget spending $5 for a magazine, they usually have current issues for $1.50. I go here for all my daughter's english books and usually save about 75%. She especially likes that since they're used some times there's already annotations in the books that help in class. Bookman's also carries a large selection of musical instruments, video games, and random items. They sponser the occasional event and allow pets in the building.

Chipotle is by far one of my favorite restaurants. It's healthy, or as healthy as you want it to be, fresh (they use local & organic whenever possible), and fast. They even have an app (but who doesn't these days) or take orders by fax. This location doesn't seem to have the usual high turnaround of most fast food type places and has several nice employees who remember my order and always smile and chat you up. My only complaint is they don't have red peppers like they're Cali stores. Of course when I asked I was told it's because they use whats best, fresh & local so I guess fresh green peppers are better than frozen red peppers.

Great deals can be found here on big name clothing but be prepared to dig some. Most items seem to be one or two only. Their bra selection is very limited to sizes most women don't wear such as 38FF! If you need a dress for New Year's or prom this would be a great place for a steal. They do have some really great prices on comforters also but again selection is limited but definitely worth a look.

Oh Chipotle how I love you...  Excellent fresh food, quick made to order, friendly people. What's not to like? Oh and their motto is Food with Integrity, meaning hormone free meats and locally grown veggies whenever possible. Fast food you can feel good about.

I was lookin up ice cream places and this was one that popped up. After seeing the Yelp $5 for $10 deal are was motivated to check it out. Glad I did. Absolutely delicious!   The sizes are on the small side but which you taste how rich and delicious it is you'll see you only need a small amount to satisfy you. I had creme brûlée and Mom had tiramusu. I read in another review that there was peanut butter and salted caramel flavors but they weren't there which leads me to believe they change out flavors. Ah damn, guess I'll have to go back to try those too. The shop also makes cakes of varying sizes for parties and sell a few Italian imported food items. I ended up buying the yelp deal enroute to the shop and had no trouble showing my iPhone to the shoppe and using the coupon.

I love Costco. I usually do quite a bit of fresh food grocery shopping here. The produce is great and decently priced. When I go to Safeway for strawberries it's always a matter of finding the container with the least moldy ones, not so at Costco. They've just started selling crab stuffed portabella mushrooms which are delicious!

I love Roadrunner. I've just gotten back into running and these guys know their stuff. They've got this whole treadmill video camera system you can use to get an analysis of your foot strike pattern so you can buy the best shoe for you. They're shoe prices are on par for what the same shoe will run you elsewhere but they also have a VIP membership that will save you 10% on all purchases. Membership is $19.99 in store but it was online for $1.99 so I mentioned that & was given the $1.99 price. Once a member you get other perks like free shipping. I ordered my new kicks since my size was out in store & got an email within 2hrs that the order was on its way! Now here's the best part, 90 days to try out your shoes. If you don't like the new barefoot Vibrams take them back and get some old skool Nikes instead. They also host running events at the store and giveaway parties. I just went to a bra fitting party for the ladies last week. Free goodie bag with keychain, sample body glide & notepad plus free champagne & chocolate covered strawberries. They had bra reps there doing personal signings & massage envy doing free massages. They even had raffles every 15mins for the 2hr event! I won a free bra priced at $50!! Love this place!!

Love the revolving sushi concept & this is one of favorites. Always a good selection & they will make to order any pieces you want not on the belt. Japanese soda, cheesecake & jello pudding also make an appearance on the sushi belt.  Be prepared for a wait at peak lunch & dinner times as this place is popping.

Great healthy options fast plus loys of delicious fresh baked goods. I've loved everything I've tried here especially the chicken walnut salad with raspberry dressing, so yummy. If you are getting a salad skip ahead of the line to the salad bar instead of waiting behind the sandwich orders. The location is great for meeting people outside of security as there's plenty of seating and it's right in the middle of both security exits.

First off this is a fast food type place not a sit down restaurant. Kinda Boston Market type place. That said it's pretty good, pretty healthy and pretty quick. I had the chicken kabobs which come with a Greek salad, rice and pita bread. If you go in thinking fast food you'll be satisfied if you're expecting a nice sit down meal keep walking.

Got a deal on Buy With Me for a facial, shampoo, deep conditioning, scalp massage, blow dry & pedicure. I've been to schools before but I think this place needs to crank it up notch or maybe give the students a little training before letting them lose on customers.  Facial wasn't bad, atmosphere is a school so no spa feel of course. They could do a little by dimming the lights more and possibly having students chat in another room. When instructor came in there wasn't much in the way of skin evaluation. More of the student trying to remember the name of mask and teaching standing there waiting for her to remember, I've been to Kohler academy where the teacher actually looked at my skin and they discussed what would work best. For $20 you really can't expect much.  The pedicure was a joke. Apparently they can't use metal instruments so they basically use cheap disposable files. Didn't realize I should have trimmed my nails prior to my pedicure! They don't have spa seats so you sit in a cheap office chair with your feet in a foot spa from Walgreens. They put various rubs on my legs but didn't do a good job getting it off as it felt I had sand on my calves when I got home. Basic single color polish and couldn't figure out how to get the pedi slipper on without smudging the polish. She also used a heel file but no pressure so it really didn't remove any dry skin to Speak of.  I've always thought the shampoo was the best part of a haircut for the whole scalp massage. The girl who did mine must have seen some creepy crawlies in my hair because she felt like she was just barely moving my hair around, I'm surprised she even got any lather from the lack of rubbing she did! She did spend a ridiculous amount of time rinsing it though. Once again no real hand to hair contact but about 15 minutes to rinse, so long in fact I had to leave with my hair dripping wet since the salon closed and they were set to start class. The instructor did come by to apologize and said I could come back for a blow out since it was included with my services. I think I'll pass but gee thanks!

I really like how they have the buffet separated into vegaterian and non vegaterian sections. Not sure what I'm eating only sure that it tastes delicious! Service is unreal. We saw another table leave and 3 people went over and started clearing the tabe off even pulling out the table and chairs to sweep underneath.

Second time here. Both times here I've had the lunch buffet for $9.99. It includes salad soup (chicken or beef) and about 12 hot options and white rice. The food is good and both times I've been the owner/cook came over and asked if there was anything she could make for us or make differently. Most foods on the buffet aren't very spicy by Thai standards but again the owner is more then willing to accomadate different tastes. I ordered a Thai Tea which I highly recommend if you've never had one. It's a sweet Creamy tea and thoroughly refreshing! Once we were about ready to pop the top button on our pants the owner arrived with huge warm bowls of sweet coconut rice covered with vanilla ice cream & diced mangos! If you need any more motivation stop over on Groupon, they usually have a $12 for $20 groupon available.  Ambience is a little lacking, need some music and a little more work on decor but a good place for thai.

This place has the most creative hot dog combos I've ever seen. Kinda disappointed in myself though. First time here and I went with the weekly special which was pretty much a chili dog. I asked for jalapeños on the side but the were all chopped up inside the chili so it was a little too hot for my mom's taste who was splitting it with me. I know I'll be back for another round & think I'll get adventurous & try the lady dog. Oh and in the way to the bathroom te have the cutest wall filled with photos of customers dogs & names of the people who love them, too cute!

Very friendly staff, nice little patio area & damn good BBQ.   Potato salad has a nice mustardy taste with big chunks of red potatoes. Sweet potato fries are actually sweet potato tator tots. Rubs were awesome! Already separated with a nice rub & squirt of sauce on each. They have extra sauce on available including a hot sauce with some serious bite!  All in all this is a great little gem and much  better than corporate America's idea of "famous" BBQ.

I was a little leery about eating here during lent but the owner had it covered. Had a wonderfully delicious vegan lentil soup with some kind of curry in it. I don't think anyone in our group had a bad thing to say about it! I also had some type of bread with mushrooms & potatos inside that was kinda like a russian pyroski. As strange as it is to say the rice was probably tied with the soup as my favorite part of the meal. It was vegetarian and had a slight yellow color to it (maybe saffron?). All in all, it was a nice little place with a very caring accommodating staff, excellent prices, delicious food, & large portions.

First time here today. Got my order to go, 24 pierogis, 3 stuffed cabbages, & a couple sausages. Pierogis are available fried or boiled & sausages can be cooked or uncooked. Added on caramelized onions for pierogis.  Wasn't a fan of the sausage & sauerkraut, a little bland for my taste. Pierogis were delicious, went with the potato & cheddar ones. Had the beef stuffed cabbage & they were really tasty & included a creamy tomato sauce. There's only about four tables for dining in. The side wall is dedicated to Polish groceries. They have a nice selection of drinks, side dishes, & desserts including several frozen cakes & a HUGE variety of frozen pierogis to take home.

Fun way to spend the day. It's quite a walk from parking to the festival but that's good cause it gives you a chance to burn off the BBQ.  There's not a lot of shade so be sure to bring a hat and sunscreen but leave the umbrella at home as security will be making you keep it in your car (they check purses). Almost all samples were 1 ticket ($2). Samples were about two bites worth of food. There are large tent areas that seemed to have space to sit in and get out of the sun.

Got a groupon deal here so I tried it out. I've only had to treatments so fa but it went well. I was very nervous about the whole laser thing. They use a cold laser and it really doen't hurt but rather feels like a really cold chill. Like I said it's only been two treatments so I haven't really noticed the results. Both times the girls were really nice, quick, and professional. The office is located in a plastic surgeon office.

15 different available bowl options plus smoothies, & snacks. Available bowls are a tasty sorbet type treat/meal. Store is a little boring inside & small but you don't come for the ambiance you come for the bowls which are delicious. Service can be a little slow at times but well worth the wait. Try it, you know you want to.

My daughter and I have been shopping here for about 5yrs. We're both casual snowboarders and come in cluelessly looking for new gear every season. The guys here are great, there's never any pressure and they are extremely helpful. We've used them for rentals, snowboard maintenance and purchasing. They have a good selection of gear and clothing plus can order if they don't have what your looking for in stock. We've been to many of the big name sporting goods stores and have had help that varies from a kid who couldn't tell a snowboard from a surfboard to another who thought he was Shaun White. They carry snowboarding, skiing & camping supplies along with scooters and even SUP board rentals. I love the friendly local service and the knowledge that we'll be treated with respect and get all our questions answered. It's a great shop you should really check out if you're looking to get outside.

Sandwiches are messy deliciousness. They have a happy hour special everyday from 4-7 when you eat in store, get a free bag I chips & drink. They have about 45 sandwich options, most are Halal chicken, steak or veggie. Four bread choices and several additional add ins available. Everyone in store is super friendly and ready to recommend their fav sandwich. My favorite so far is the Mozzarella's Big Cheese. It's chicken, honey, honey mustard, havarta, & provolone cheese. The onion rings are the only downside I've tried so far. Kinda limp and soggy, I guess their made more to go in the sandwiches rather then as a side.

Split q lunch at modern grove. Had the mac & cheese bites and pizza Bianca. Decor is cute if not your standard for a fast casual hipster place. Order at the counter and get a number, food is delivered, full bar in the back, self serve fountain sodas in dining room along with a cooler of bottled drinks and small assortment of specialty grocery items.   Mac & cheese bites were a little bland in their own but tasty with the cheese bacon dipping sauce. The pizza was too big for a single person but not quite enough to share without ordering an appetizer. The prosciutto was more a basic lunch meat ham then traditional prosciutto. The cook also had a heavy hand with the meat, more isn't always better. The crust was thoroughly cooked with dark brown coloring on the bottom but tasted doughy and under done.  Over all the look is good, the menu sounds great but the actual food isn't impressive and is a tad over priced.

I've taken my Mom's Toyota here several times and have had good service. There's a kids play area, barber, & comfy seats while you wait. The lobby has wi-fi along with complimentary coffee, bottled water, & fruit.
