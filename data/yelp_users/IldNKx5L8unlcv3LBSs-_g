This large, airy hotel restaurant is a good local lunch spot for something a bit more healthy than a burger. Our waitress was prompt and efficient. I was impressed at how knowledgeable she was when I asked about some menu substitutions.  My friends and I each had a salad. Mine was a big, fresh, and tasty oriental salad with mandarin oranges, romaine, and water chestnuts. The peanutty dressing came on the side without me asking, which I absolutely appreciate. They also had an option for marinated and then lightly sauteed chunks of tofu as a salad add-on (I don't care for chicken), and it was quite good. The marinade tasted like a light soy. I'd definitely have it again.  In case the listing info isn't clear, this restaurant is located in the Hilton Phoenix Airport, on the north end of the building.

Nicest track in the area. Older than Yavapai but better kept, and not a dump like Rillito. The clubhouse area is clean and comfortable. Lots of food and drink selections. The in-field is beautifully landscaped, and it has a turf track in addition to the dirt track. This is a great place to spend a few hours.

The South Bank Grill is a great little lunch spot. Don't blink as you drive down 40th Street, or you'll miss it between the junk yard and the industrial complex.  The interior is an eclectic mixture of sports memorabilia (go Bears!), circa 1986 wall art, and kitchen decorating on a dime. Tables and chairs mostly match and are of the church basement variety. You'll also find a pool table here, but no play until after 2pm so that customers can lunch in peace.  The menu contains a standard bar and grill offerings, and everything I've had has been quite good. The salads are huge with fresh toppings, though I admit I wasn't a fan of the sherry vinaigrette and had to turn it in for ranch. I've also tried their pierogi special, which was as authentic as I'd find in the Red Apple in Chicago (but less greasy).  The staff are the best part of this diner. My waitress was happy, funny, and very attentive. I'm annoyed by waitstaff who show up when I don't need them and hide when I do, but our server was perfect. I'd recommend this place because of her, even if the food was bad.  Plenty of parking available off street. They also have a full bar for afternoon meetings. They can handle groups of up to 6 easily, but if you bring more, show up early so you can find seating.

My favorite bagel shop in the area. It can get hectic on weekend mornings, but no more than other bagel shops in the area. The quality is great, and the keep the place clean. I keep coming back.   They also take pre-orders. Want a half dozen for home or want to make sure your one favorite will be there for breakfast? Call before you drive over, and they'll have a fresh batch waiting.

Count on Charleston's for top-notch food, service, and ambience.  I have visited this location at least a half dozen times, so I can attest to their consistency. My favorite dish is the Honey Lime Chicken Salad, which is light and tasty. It comes with a somewhat sticky (from a baked-on glaze) but amazing croissant. I'd prefer if they'd offer a half portion since it's a huge meal, and it doesn't survive to the next day.  Other menu items that my friends rave about are the pork chops, garlic mashed potatos, soups (especially the potato), burgers and chicken strips.   Going to Charleston's reminds me of visiting an old Chicago steakhouse. It has a dark, rich decor with lots of wood and leather. Even though the room seems dark, the table is well lit, giving customers a sense of intimacy.  The service is outstanding. The staff all work together, gliding quietly past tables clearing dishes and filling drinks. They are non-intrusive but anytime I look like I want my server, someone quickly appears to help me. There's definitely no "where's my waitress?" syndrome here.

A few weeks ago, some knuckler smacked the trunk of my Jetta with his oversized truck as I was sitting at a stop sign. Since I know close to nothing about cars (did I mention I drive a Jetta?), I didn't have a body shop preference. Based on the first review listed here, I picked Valley East Collision.  What was great: 1) Bob Arnold. He is a role model for customer service and was so pleasant every time I spoke with him. 2) Quality of work. Maybe car snobs who spend their time talking about  how great next year's auto show will be can tell the difference, but I don't see any evidence that my car had been damaged. 3) Easy for my insurance company. Bob didn't ask for more cash after the quote and the experience was easy for both me and my insurance agent. 4) Speed. They called me a day earlier than I expected, so I could get out of that miserable rental. 5) Attention to detail. He replaced all the badges on my trunk so it would look original. He cleaned my car (even the inside) and got tar off my passenger door. He remembered my name without any prompting. The paint matching was absolutely perfect.  I can't recommend this place more highly.

Best Vietnamese restaurant in the area. It's a slightly run-down restaurant in an unassuming strip mall, but the food is fantastic.  The menu ranges from traditional pho to rice or noodle dishes to crustry bread sandwiches. Some hot pot, family-style dishes are also available. I've never had the pho, but my father raves that it's the best soup he's ever had.  My favorite dish is Bun Thit Nuong (#34). It's a bed of fresh lettuce, bean sprouts and rice vermicelli with about 10 oz. of barbequed pork, topped with minced green onions and crushed peanuts. It's served with with Nuoc Cham, a traditional sweet/sour/salty dressing with grated carrots. Cost: $4.75.  I also recommend the roll appetizers. Two dollars will get you two shrimp and pork spring rolls in rice paper, or two fried pork and vegetable egg rolls with all the typical trimmings (wrap the eggroll in lettuce and mint leaves before dipping in the Nuoc Cham).

My favorite breakfast spot in the East Valley. Crackers is hidden away in an industrial park, but it's worth tracking down. You'll forget that you're parked behind a Home Depot once you get inside.  The staff is professional and friendly, and the wait is usually minimal, even on busy Sunday mornings. This is a fantastic place to take your out of town guests, but please leave your kids at home. They're welcome there, but they annoy me.  I generally order either the breakfast sandwich (canadian bacon, scrambled egg and cheddar on a fresh croissant -- always perfect), or the traditional breakfast, which I transform into Andrea's Personal Breakfast special by making 8 special requests. They'll add pretty much anything to anything (if they have it) and make it any way you want. Amazingly, they rarely get special orders wrong.  The portions are huge, but the quality is good. Fruit is always reliably fresh, and if you like sweet, unhealthy breakfasts, try the french toast. It's more of a dessert than a day-starter.  Lunch is as good as breakfast, though my experience with there lunch is infrequent. The soups are outstanding and a definite must-have for lunch.

Great place for a manicure and pedicure. It's spotless, airy, and light -- a good place to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.  There are about eight pedicure chairs, and they'll let you soak if they can't start your pedicure right away. There are six or seven manicure stations, so it's easy to bring your friends and have a conversation. Or if you're alone, there are plenty of recent magazines to keep you busy.  Prices are qutie reasonable -- $18 for a pedicure and about the same for a French manicure. Tina did a great job on mine, and I'll go back again soon. Drop-ins are welcome.

Wow! This is a great little Japanese hole-in-the-wall that seems to specialize in quality take-out.  When Brak and I walked in, the place was empty and I was ready to be disappointed, despite of the other reviews. The menu had a ton of cooked food (teriyaki, yakisoba, donburi, etc.), and as a sushi eater, I wasn't quite sure what to pick. When I asked what one item meant, the man at the counter (the owner?) said the book would help...and handed me a small photo album with photos of quite a few of the menu items. It was funny and effective.  I was surprised how busy the place is. While I was deciding what to order (3-4 minutes), the phone rang at least three times for take-out. In the half-hour I was in the dining area, at least 15 people picked up orders or sat down for a meal. It appears that they have a strong following, well-earned if the food I had was typical.  I ordered a small shrimp yakisoba and a soda. The taste was good, and even the small order was a huge amount of food. Our orders were really pretty quickly, but it didn't seem like the food was pre-made and sitting on warmers. The service was also really good; I got a kick out of the owner. He was genuinely interested in how we liked our meals.  I suggest this place for a simple, cheap dinner and would definitely visit again.

Holy carp, do I love this place! It's my new favorite weekend breakfast hangout.  Brak and I have figured out how to maneuver at Liberty Market (best tip: get in the door before 9) and have had about six good breakfasts in a row. I'm currently on a not-much-meat kick -- as opposed to my all-ribs-all-the-time kick -- so I've only had the veggie scramble with toast.  My order is a little different each time, but always good. Sometimes the veggies are cut more fine, and the cooks obviously add them in different proportions depending on mood. I love that they have a light hand on the cheese in their eggs...when the already-good potatoes are light on cheddar, they are the best.  This menu definitely offers several choices for ridiculously unhealthy breakfasts. Cinnamon rolls, biscuits, several forms of bread pudding, plus gravy makes my head hurt. Sticking with the eggs pays off; they are the freshest eggs I've ever tasted in Arizona.

I've visited Gold Bar a few times over the last couple of weeks, but I find myself hunting for other options. The coffee itself is pretty good, and the prices are competitive. But here are a few reasons why I won't be back:  * Sometimes it's hard to get the owners' attention so I can make a purchase, because they're so focused on interacting with their personal friends. I've had to wait in line while they watch videos together.  * Too much clutter. There are so many knick-knacks, coffee gadgets, books, etc. everywhere that the employees are forced to do food prep on tables in the customer seating area. At least two tables near the front door are always filled with food inventory, baskets, platters, plastic wrap, etc - whatever is needed for prep the staff is working on at the time.  * The more I visit, the more I realize that the place is filthy, really filthy. Tables are often sticky even after they just open, and the floor is a disaster. Worst of all, there is a vent cover so thick with dust right above where they prep food and drink orders that I can't help but think dust is dropping into the consumables.

Not a great Subway. It almost never has another customer, for reasons that are pretty clear. The staff is sullen and disinterested. They skimp on the ingredients (especially the vegetables -- ask for more to get the stink eye). Keep on going to the Subway on University and Country Club for a better experience.

I love this course. I love this course.  Riverview is a city-run, inexpensive nine-hole a few notches above a typical executive course. Prices are great (about $15 per person for a cart on a summer weekend morning), and it seems very well run.  Most of the holes are a par 4, with a pair of 3s and 5s on each end of the course. Overall it's well kept and attractive, even though it's wedged between a busy street and the nexus of two highways.  The practice facilities are a huge plus for this course. The driving range sits in the middle of the location and is open until late in the evening. (Forget Fiddlesticks, this is the place to go at night.) A nice feature of the range is that it sits right under the landing path for Sky Harbor Airport, so you can see the planes but they're high enough that you won't get the noise.  Riverview also has a large (free) practice putting green, a chipping practice area and two sandtrap practice setups (one on the far end of the driving range, behind the green on the 5th hole). It's never seemed crowded to me, and the people who play (and the staff) are there have been friendly.  The pro shop isn't anything to write home about and there's little for food other than bottled drinks and chips, but overall this is a great place to spend time.

I am a terrible car owner, the kind that makes most men wince. So it's a joy for me to find a service center with staff who don't make faces of pain when I waltz in (they also didn't make any chi-ching! noises when I asked for prices, which I found out later were pretty typical). The service manager was very patient when he explained options for me, and he did a great job of giving me enough information to let me make my own choices.  I've had my tires aligned and rotated here, and done several oil changes as well. Since my car is still running, it all must have gone pretty well.  I have waited every time I've visited, and the work always seemed to go quickly. The waiting room is sort of clean...not so bad that I didn't want to touch anything (I didn't see the bathroom). There is a selection of magazines, a lot of which don't involve cars, and a TV blaring Judge Judy or afternoon sitcoms. Coffee always seems to be brewing, and water and soda are available.  They take walk-ins, but you'll have better luck if you make an appointment.

I'm so disappointed in this place. The mechanics do good work, but the service writers are a mess.   My last three visits have all taken 3-4 times longer than quoted because of parts order screw ups.  They even sent me home once after 4 hours because they couldn't finish an oil change, air and fuel filter swap in one visit. That's the easy stuff, guys.   Today the service writers joked with me about always making me wait, while two mechanics hung around the lobby because they couldn't move forward on half-done jobs. When my car is filling a bay, that means the poor schlump scheduled for the next timeslot isn't getting out of there any time soon.   I know this location was worried that the train construction was going to kill their business. They should be more worried about their reputation. A new VW mechanic opened up nearby, so don't expect me to be back to Network. Who has the time?   Note on the response from the business: Yeah, I know. That's why I always call a day or two in advance to ask you guys to have the filters. Your organizational issues aren't my fault, and I'm disappointed that I'd be blamed. Sorta makes my point.

I've been to this location about 40 times over the last six years. It's conveniently located and dependable.  They have a few washing choices, from the drive-through $4 wash, to vacuum and wash options with dry offs in the $8-15 range, and some more expensive, more comprehensive options. All the washes are through their drive-through, but they do seem to have a detailing service in the back.  One of the nice things about The Carwasher is the shade. Even in 105 degree heat, you can find plenty of space to wait out of the sun. They have some seating in the store, where they also sell random stuff (windshield screens, scented trees to hang from your rearview, greeting cards, candy, etc.), plus several benches outside where you can see your car being dried.  On a few visits I have sprung for the extra $1 per floor mat cleaning. My mats are rubber but catch all sort of ground up refuse, and they have always come out great. As far as the cleanings are concerned, my only complaints are that they sometimes forget to vacuum the trunk and they always mess with all my seat and mirror settings.  Tip: They frequently have deals where you can buy coupons for future use at a discount. I have a stock of full wash coupons in my glove compartment (paying for them in advance makes me more likely to get my car cleaned). I'm also currently using a 60 day, $18 unlimited drive-through "monsoon special" card. It cost the same as 4 and a half drive-through washes, but I've used it about a dozen times with a week to go, so it's a great bargain.  Open at about 8am daily and closing at about 6pm (they have a schedule, I just don't recall it).

The product is good, but Brandon added extra upsell items onto my bill and then was a jerk when I asked for a refund. I will NEVER return.

Awful, awful, awful. I had a complete lapse of judgment and picked up a meal here. Don't repeat my mistake.  The food is low quality, drowning in badly made sauces, and not even close to healthy. Chinese can be done well, but this isn't it. It's a shame that so many vegetables were wasted in a poor attempt to make these dishes.  It's not a buffet -- it's counter where you point and they scoop. There are around five entrees, rice and noodles. You can sit down in a sticky booth or just take your styrofoam container with you.

Dingy, dark, dirty, sticky -- that's your table. Greasy, unappealing, low quality -- that's your food. Someone obviously put a lot of time, money and love to build this business (from the decor I'm guessing it was once an interesting, somewhat upscale place). Today, it's a dump.  I ordered the chile relenos. The beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless. There was more egg than chile, though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate. I'll never go here again.

Rosa's is the only Mexican place I like in the East Valley. They serve baja-style, seemingly authentic Mexican, with fresh ingredients and good service. Don't be put off by the almost-dead, no habla ingles crappy shopping plaza...just park in the ample lot and ignore your surroundings.  I've been there enough to have settled on a favorite dish: the baja shrimp tacos (also available in a tasty grilled fish), which are amazing. The shrimp is always perfect, and it's complemented with a not-too-sweet pineapple salsa and fresh vegetables. I'm not a rice and beans fan, and the staff has always happily substituted black beans and a grilled corn-off-the-cob dish.  I did once have a mistep, which might have been more my taste than the food: I didn't care for the mango chicken salad. The carmelized onions with mango didn't appeal to me, even though separately the ingredients were all fine.  The highlight of Rosa's is the green salsa verde that's served with chips as you wait. They'll also bring a red tomato salsa to your table, but you'll forget about it after you try the green.

I'm shocked that Grandma's Kitchen has been open as long as it has (and could afford to move to a great location). The food is mediocre at best, and the service is off the charts bad.  My boyfriend and I had breakfast here twice before swearing never to come again. His omelet was so-so, and my oatmeal was watery and possibly instant. The toast was good, but that's not a shock.  The seating area is crowded with furniture that obviously doesn't suit the space. It's hard to move around in the restaurant, there's no waiting area, and you have to climb over high-back stools in order to attempt to pay at the cash register. (If people can't get to their counter, they should accept payments at the table.)  The worst part of the restaurant is the service. When we first visited, there was a grouchy late-middle-aged woman we thought might be Grandma. She ignored the customers, and some even left after being seated but before eating. On our second visit, we met Grandma. What a nasty, irritable monster. I'll never spend a dime on a place that behaves this way to its customers. Shame on you, Grandma.

I have a lot of dogs, so I do a lot of grooming. Top Dog is my favorite in west Mesa.  There are typically three or four groomers working everytime I come in. They'll take walk-ins for any type of service, even the fancy breed-specific cuts. Nail trims cost $12 and take about 5 minutes. I've never had a dog leave with a bleeding nail.  They keep a record of each dog's visits, so I don't have to repeat instructions from visit to visit. You can also see them working from the lobby, so you can watch to see how it goes (but don't let your dog see you; it's harder for the groomer to keep them calm). The owner works there, so if you have issues, you can easily pull her aside.  Parking is available in a lot. There are two chairs in the lobby (along with leashes and toys for sale), but there's not much within strolling distance, so bring a book or run your errands if you have a wait.

I love this service. I've been through a few services over the last five years, but I'm staying with Maids on the Spot.  I don't speak Spanish, so I really appreciate that the owner ensures that all the workers can speak English very well. They clean my whole house but do a deep cleaning to one room on each visit, and I can really tell when they've been to my house. They're very conscientious with taking care of the details.  It took me a while to get comfortable with a service entering my house when I wasn't home, but I have no problem with them doing so now. They were very accommodating with my distrust, and let me get to know the team assigned to me for many cleanings until I was ready to turn over a key. The team is also very good with my animals; I think my dog actually looks forward to them visiting.  When I first started with Maids on the Spot, the owner visited my house for a tour. He noted all my wants (always, always dust the ceiling fans) and needs (use only the stuff I provide to dust my piano). He gave me a price options (based on frequency) and took notes, which ended up in a file about me that the cleaning teams bring along to my house.  They let me pick my cleaning day and approximate time. They've been very good about giving me a reminder a day or two before a cleaning, and they've been great about accommodating my schedule if I need to move a date. They've never cancelled on me or not shown up.  I highly recommend this service...and if you're lucky, you'll get Brenda's team (the others are good too, but there's only one Brenda).

Rosati's is one of the better pizza options in the Valley. I've only had the thin crust, but it is excellent. The center is rarely underdone or droopy. They cut it into squares rather than pie slices, which is a minor annoyance.  Stay away from the pasta; it's wet, the marinara is obviously canned and quite runny, and it's overloaded with cheese. The garlic bread is ok, but it won't save one of their pasta dinners. But it's a pizza place, so I won't ding them for bad pasta. The salads are so-so; heavy on the iceberg lettuce but still fresh, so don't shy away if you want to combine a salad with a little pizza for a lighter dinner.  The atmosphere is inviting, with decorations reminiscent of Chicago without being overwhelming (I'm talking to you, Pizzeria Uno). The staff is decent, though they're often hidden in the kitchen or bar and not often at the tables.

My experience at Golfland has been with mini golf only. We've played three or four times over the last few months, and it's a nice way to pass an hour or so. If you're lucky, the courses won't be too crowded and there won't be much wait time between holes.  They have three mini golf courses, one of which has been partially closed during summer 2010 due to construction of a water slide. The holes are in good (but not great) shape and are not a guaranteed hole-in-one, so you won't be bored. A few of them aren't working perfectly, such as jerky rising bridges and the occasional clogged piping, but it won't affect your overall experience.  The best part of the courses is their design. Someone put a lot of thought into how to integrate water features and landscaping into the courses. Mature shade trees cover most of the area. It's a great place to escape the heat and spend some time outdoors without a lot of exertion. The streams and waterfalls are especially nice.  The main building is pretty much a dump, however. I suggest passing through as quickly as possible (you'll want to run when you see the screaming kids and the incessant dinging of video games). Don't bother with the food and drink, and stay away from the bathrooms except for emergencies.

I have visited Boston's twice, and both times I've been disappointed.  The wait staff is ok but not particularly attentive. They seemed to want to refill my water ten times while I'm waiting for my food, but they are nowhere to be found when I'm missing a fork.  The food is not great. The salmon on the salmon caesar was overcooked and dry, and there was far too much dressing on the salad itself. The pizza is nothing to get excited about; you can get a better pie at a dozen other places in the area.  This is a great place to take co-workers you don't like, when you don't want them to know where you normally have lunch.

I visited Jaycee Dog Park recently -- never again.  It's a tiny park, not much bigger than the backyards in the area. It was very nicely shaded, with a building on the west side, and many trees. Staying out of the sun here is not a problem, nor is finding a seat on one of its many benches. It also has a double gate, and plenty of parking close to the entrance. The city also supplies poop bags...  ...but apparently no one has ever used one. When I had five dogs, my backyard didn't accumulate this much poop in a month. It's disgusting, and a health hazard. Who are the people who don't clean up after their dogs?  Other issues: The grass is excessively long in the areas where it grows. It looks like a weed garden in some sections. The ground is covered with trash, mainly of the bottles/cigarettes kind, along with candy wrappers.  Beware, small dog owners. There is a gap large enough for a 15-20 lb. dog to pass between the gate and the fence on each of the two gates in the entrance. It would not be difficult for them to escape to the main park.

Since today (21 August) is National Spumoni Day and Brak celebrates these sorts of things, we wanted to find a restaurant that serves the stuff. A quick Yelp search and we had a hit.  A small strip mall cafe on a Sunday night should be sad and empty, but not this place -- there were at least 8 tables filled before we finished our meal. Now that I've eaten there, I'm not surprised that Miele's has such a steady business.  The food was fantastic. The bruschetta appetizer was huge and delicious: five pieces of properly garlic-rubbed and oiled bread, and a ton of fresh, chopped tomatoes with a light oil drizzle and lots of basil. It was so good I took the leftovers home, even though I know they won't be the same tomorrow.  For the entree, I ordered off-menu (as usual), and even though I thought I confused the waiter, he nailed it. I had the gnocchi, which they normally oven bake with sausage, peppers, and cheese, but instead tossed with a spicy marinara sauce. The sauce was thick, very spicy (in a good way), and amazing. I would definitely order both dishes again, though not at the same time -- it was far too much food.  The restaurant was small but comfortable and nicely decorated. There are about five booths, about the same number of tables, and a lot of seating at the bar. There were two TVs on in corners, but they were unobtrusive (and did give us a chance to see the football game). Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  We're big fans of Italian food, and we've been looking for a place to call our favorite for a long time. I think we've finally found it, and we'll definitely be regulars. Thanks, Miele's.

Pet Club carries a wide variety of food for dogs and cats. If you want low end food, go elsewhere. They specialize in mid- to high-end products (don't believe the other reviewer -- she got it wrong). They also carry food for birds, rodents, and horses, but I can't vouch for their selection for these animals. The prices are fantastic -- bagged food is always several dollars cheaper than Petco/Petsmart, and canned food is sometimes as much as a dollar cheaper per can. Pet Club staff are far more knowledgable about pet nutrition and food options than the big stores.  Even though they specialize in food, Pet Club carries a selection of supplies other than food, such as collars, leashes, grooming products, bowls, beds, toys, cat trees, and treats. It's not huge, but there's enough variety for most people. FInally, there is no actual club -- no membership is required.  This location is small and cramped (the majority of the location is warehouse for inventory) and not particularly clean, but the service and quality of product is great. Skip the narrow parking lot and park on the east side of the building but don't worry -- they'll happily carry everything to your car for you. Pets welcome.

What a sad, outdated grocery store. It tries hard to stay clean (which it generally does) and please its customers (which it can), but it cannot compete with the nicer stores in the area. In fact, Fry's has a much better competing store a mile away, at Main and Alma School.  The meat section is ok but it doesn't shine when it comes to quality and selection. The deli is questionable at best, and the bakery doesn't stock much. The produce section is typically Fry's, which means you won't find anything special here, and the prices are not fantastic. There is a tiny floral section and a full pharmacy.  The worst part of the store is the parking lot. It's easy to access, but once you're inside, plan on bumping over multiple speed bumps and waiting for several other slow and unmotivated drivers. The store does not police its entrance well, so it's not uncommon for someone to park in the throughway right in front of the entrance.   They didn't have cart corrals in the parking lot for years, but about a year ago, they took up many, many parking spots with tiny, cheap, poorly made corrals that no one uses anyway. This parking lot is chaos.

This Fry's is better than most in terms of cleanliness and selection, and on the low end of the service scale. Getting help at the deli counter or butcher takes a ton of patience, and the checkouts are slow. Overall, it's a better option than the other neighboring Fry's stores.  I'm a regular here because they have a gas station with the cheapest diesel in the area.

I have a love-hate relationship with the Mesa Community Restaurant. I love the decor and the owner, Spiro. But I just hate the food.  It's a free-standing building just off Country Club, with parking on the street or beside/behind the building. Parking is never an issue. Inside, you'll find every color imaginable, with a heavy dose of teal. The plexi windows that enclosed the old smoking room have painted on Christmas decorations even in July, and there is an assortment of random photographs and prints on the walls.  The food is Denny's or worse. Pastas are watery, burgers are uninspired, and hashbrowns are underdone. It's never that busy here, not that I'm surprised.  The wait staff here is not great. I like to sit at the counter and watch people, and I've actually seen a waitress grab a handful of ice from the ice chest and drop it into a glass for a customer (right under the use the scoop or get fired sign!).  But Spiro's a gem. If you decide to stop in, be sure to spend a few minutes chatting with him. Just don't get your hopes up with the food.

Not much differentiates this Walgreens from all the others. It does have a drive-through pharmacy, but it's not open 24 hours. The photo counter staff is ridiculously grumpy, but otherwise the staff have been quite friendly. It's clean, never too busy, and the only drugstore in the area.

CInemark is my favorite theater in the area. It's never crowded in the theater or the parking lot, it's generally clean as far as theaters go, and there is theater style seating for every screen. DInner options nearby aren't great (mostly fast-food options), but it is possible to get a good meal nearby.  Pet peeves: The bathrooms are not conveniently located once you pass the ticket taker. The concessions stands are glacially slow. No where to sit down in the hallways (past the ticket taker).

When this place opened several years ago, it was decent for chain pizza. I picked up a pepperoni pizza earlier this year. They've clearly slipped. The pizza was greasy and orange, without a crisp crust. The ingredients were low-end; all I could taste was oil.  Pizza Patron doesn't deliver and has no seating. It is takeout only and I think it may only take cash (although they do take both US and Mexican currency -- I kid you not). It is cheap, around $5-6 for a single topping. They have some pizzas always ready, in case you can't wait.

Joe's Farm Grill is the place to go for something when you are tired of traditional American food. The building is modern and funky, the surrounding green space is cool and inviting, and the food is reliably good.  Order at the walk-up counter and keep up because the line can move quickly. The line can be long during busy hours, so I try to avoid peak times, especially because the wails of poorly managed children echo painfully loudly in the high-ceilinged counter area. (And unfortunately, there always seems to be at least one family ignoring a screaming kid in the place.) Once you've placed your order, you can take the order-is-ready buzzer and go find a seat inside or on the patio or yard seating.  I've tried a number of things on the menu, all of which have been good. The Ahi sandwich has a generous portion of perfectly seared tuna. It was too much food (and the wasabi dressing was a bit to spicy for me) and the meal turned out to be a drippy mess, but I liked it.  The barbeque chicken pizza is good but usually too wet (I like pizza crisp), and I also recommend the pepperoni pizza. The Asian salad is delicious; Joe's salads definitely show off how fresh all the ingredients are. I recently tried the ribs and pulled pork platter. It was big enough to feed two adults, and both meats were excellent.  The best item on the menu is the sweet potato fries. It's a large portion of not greasy (maybe baked?), mildly seasoned thin-sliced fries with a mango/pineapple chutney on the side. I upgrade to them at every opportunity. I also suggest keeping an eye out for seasonal/special items; I once tried a date shake and it was fantastic.  The bathrooms always seem to be extremely clean and have a fun, funky decor. Display cases with old Barbie and G.I.Joe style dolls are built into the walls, and an in-wall TV shows what looks to be old Thunderbirds (marionette) episodes on continual loop.

Although small (less than an acre), Mitchell is the best dog park in the area. There is grass -- patchy in places, but grass nonetheless, and more than the picture shows -- surrounded by rock, and some concrete on a sidewalk that leads to seating.  There is plenty of street parking plus some off-street parking next to the old school. The fencing is secure all around the park and the entrance is double-gated. Benches line the park and four or five picnic tables are available. Shade is at a premium, however, so be prepared for the sun in the heat of summer. There is also lighting inside the park, but I haven't actually been there after dark.  The park regulars to a good job of making people feel welcome and policing the park. You'll see some poop, but not much, and neighborhood kids are quickly kicked out. Some kind soul brought a big bucket to use with the water tap (on the side of the people and dog water fountain), and people work together to keep the bucket full and clean so that dogs can drink without waiting for a person to push the button.  Big and small dogs aren't separated here, but I haven't seen any issues for this reason. People do a great job of keeping an eye on their dogs and making sure that squabbles don't turn into fights.  Closed on Mondays.

One of the best restaurants in the East Valley. I've been going to Blue Adobe for about five years, and it's as good today as it was the first time I visited. The service is first rate and attentive, with seating prompt, and the restaurant is clean (including the bathrooms).  Blue Adobe is a great option for someone who likes Mexican but wants a healthier option. Nothing is smothered in cheese, is refried, or is greasy, even when fried. Portions are huge, but they aim for quality more than quantity.  My favorite dish the Adobe Salad (a large with added shrimp will put you back about $15, but it's worth every penny), made of baby greens, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, tortilla strips, and the most amazing and addictive orange/chipotle dressing and your choice of protein (tenderloin, shrimp, salmon, chicken, or none at all).  Another great dish worth mentioning are the tenderloin rellenos. Typical Mexican restaurant chili relenos are eggy with greasy filling; these are lightly breaded and filled with high quality cheese and meat. These rellenos hold their pepper shape well too; you won't find a chile flattened across your plate here.  The negatives: it can get kind of loud from conversation. I also thought their pizza was mediocre, but I think the pizza dishes aren't on the menu anymore.  Pay no attention to the rash of one-star reviews. Blue Adobe seats about 30-40; if the group had actually tried to make a reservation for a group that big, they'd have been told to rent the whole restaurant for the night. Shame on them for showing up with more people than promised and then flaming this review board.

I've used several boarding facilities in the Valley, but this is the only one I recommend. Dog Days is fantastic!  I have some special needs for my dogs -- I feed them raw food rather than canned or kibble, and one is deaf. Plus, with as many five dogs in my household, I like to keep them together at night, rather than separated into various cages. The staff here didn't balk at any of my requests, and they happily accommodated my needs.  The facility is well laid-out and very clean. The front office is sometimes unmanned (because they're taking care of the dogs), but they're always prompt when someone comes in or in returning phone calls. The main inside play area is separated into areas for small dogs and big dogs, and sleeping quarters are in the rear (individual and shared cages). Bring enough dogs, and they'll let them sleep in the play area overnight.   The facility also has a "backyard" with kiddie swimming pools, so they can get fresh air a few times a day. The arrangement is much better than the dogs sitting in some narrow, stifling indoor/outdoor dog run in the heat of summer. No grass, unfortunately, but I'll take dog playtime and air conditioning over grass any day.  The best part of my experience is how quickly they got to know me. I was surprised that when we arrived to start a second stay at Dog Days, Frances (the owner) and her staff remembered my dogs' names, how they like to play, which one is shy, and which one is deaf. I absolutely feel comfortable with leaving my dogs with someone who pays such close attention to her clients and their animals.

I'm upgrading my review for the sole reason that the St Louis ribs are fabulous. I take mine naked, and I've never been disappointed...  Famous Dave's isn't bad for a chain restaurant. It has all the annoying chain restaurant decor and lack of actual character (down to a poor employee dressed as a pig), but those negatives are offset by decent food and service.  The pulled pork is fine, though a little dry and sometimes a burned chunk can show up on your plate. The sauces are good, with several options on your table. The corn bread muffins are fine, but the corn on the cob is typically overcooked. They do have fantastic coleslaw and great beans, so if you pick your sides carefully, you can end up with a good meal.  I don't like the restaurant area (too many people, too much clutter on the walls, too noisy and too many wandering pig mascots), so I generally sit in the relative peace of the bar. It's a good option for a pre-movie dinner at Mesa Riverpoint.

This is a nice little, hole in the wall pizza shop. I wouldn't travel too far to visit, but if you're in the area, stop by. (Park behind the building.)  The street is great, and if there's an event in the area, Queen's would be a good place to people watch. The building is far bigger than they need (think long but not wide), and the decor has a funky, empty, cavernous feel. I liked the antique flag on the ceiling. They also have a tabletop Ms Pacman machine, plus some more modern arcade games.  There's no actual bakery (that I could see), but there is a private baker that shares the space.  The pepperoni pizza was better than expected.  The good, standard thin crust was baked well, and the sauce was excellent. The ingredients seemed fresh, and I'd have it again.   Two things were odd: There was a creepy mid-40s guy hanging around the cash register who kept talking over us while we were trying to order. I thought he was a lonely local who liked to chat with the waitstaff, but when he delivered the pizza to the table, I realized he was probably in charge. Mr. Manager, go sit in the office.  The other odd thing was that they had styrofoam cups. I don't like touching styrofoam, much less drinking from it, so I hope they decide to upgrade and buy better supplies in the future.

The new location is nicer, but the service is really going downhill. We've visited about once a month, and each time there's some minor screw up. The pizza is inconsistent, but it's pretty good when they're on their game.   On a busy night, don't bother. You'll be disappointed by the service. They're not managed well enough to handle a crowd. But on a quiet night, it's a good place for an average meal.

What Pita Jungle does, it does well. The food and service are consistent. What stands out for this location is how much more comfortable it is (both in the restaurant and in the parking lot) compared to locations on Ray, Shea, Apache Blvd, or Indian School. At this location you can be assured that: 1) you'll find a parking spot immediately 2) your server will pay attention to you (I'm talking to you, Ray location) 3) the next table of people won't be so close that you get elbowed  Pita Jungle has succumbed to the huge portion fad, so order carefully or you'll end up with far more food that you need. I have found that they are willing (especially at this location) to make smaller versions of the dishes, so if you want two pieces of dolma or a half of a fruit platter, just ask.  My favorite dishes are the babaganoush and the falafel. The platters are good but far too big for one person, so find someone to share. This is especially a problem with the fruit and cheese platter, which I refer to as the Matterhorn of fruit. I tried the Chicken Putanesca once; it was good, but too oily and the chicken was a bit dry. The Gambas con Ajo, on the other hand, was excellent, with its spicy marinara and perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp.  This location is always clean, including the bathrooms. There is also a pseudo-bar area (do they serve alcohol?) with a lot of seating, so if you happen to arrive while the restaurant is full, you'll have somewhere nicer than a parking lot to wait.

FInally, a little taste of Wisconsin has come to the valley! I remember two things about Culvers from my days in the north woods: it's really unhealthy and really tasty. So when I saw they had opened up in my neighborhood, I just kept on driving.  It turns out that the menu isn't as unhealthy as I thought. It's still a variety of fast food (though definitely more high quality), but with a little planning you can find some good choices on the menu. The pot roast sandwich and mashed potatoes without gravy is less than 500 calories.  Suffice it to say, I've only had the pot roast sandwich and plain mashed potatoes at this Culvers. Both are excellent. The pot roast has a fantastic flavor and always tastes fresh. The mashed potatoes are smooth and creamy. You won't even miss the gravy.

What a soul-crushing experience is Cracker Barrel. There is no more miserable experience than eating breakfast at this dump.  Still, Brak and I go here with Bob the Programmer for breakfast after a round of golf because it's close to the course. There really isn't any other reason to visit.  On our last visit, we had a horrible time getting the attention of our waiter. Our drink glasses were bone dry, and we couldn't flag anyone down to fill them. We did catch the attention of the 3 year old at the next table, which is the last thing I want -- I prefer my peace. As is typical at Cracker Barrel, every meal was served on about three plates, so we quickly ran out of table space and had to navigate and consolidate in order to maneuver.  On our previous visit, our waitress stank. Not a working-so-hard-that-she's-getting-a-little-sweaty stink, but a I-can't-believe-she-hasn't-been-fired stench. Every time she approached our table, we held our breath and talked about leaving. Seriously appalling. (Note that we did come back -- I don't know why either.)  The food is mediocre at best. Everything is bland and white, though I discovered that a nice yogurt and fruit parfait. I can't even imagine what anyone would order for lunch or dinner.  I don't have much to say that's good about Cracker Barrel, but I'll try. It has a big parking lot. There are at least 20 paths from the restaurant to do front door, so if you can get past the hostess station, you can always navigate around the gummers and the kids. It is also highly air conditioned, which feels divine after a round of golf when it's 106 in the shade....that'll boil your brain a bit and make Cracker Barrel seem like a good idea.

I love this animal hospital. I've tried a few in the area, and they rate #1 in my experience.  I've had appointments with all three vets. Dr Moffit is extremely knowledgeable. She didn't give me any grief because I feed my dogs a raw diet, and in fact gave me some advice about how to ensure they're getting proper nutrition. She was also gave me a very comprehensive explanation of options when my cat recently got sick.  Dr Funk is both professional and fun. The man has a lot of knowledge, but it's not beneath him to wrestle with my dogs to make them feel more comfortable. Since he specializes in exotics I don't see him often, but I can count on him  to see me if the other doctors are unavailable.  Dr Danner is new to the practice, but I've seen her two or three times. I really like how comfortable she makes me feel. She follows up on her patients herself, and she was willing to answer all my questions when a new kitten (my first cat in a long, long time) got sick. She, like the other vets, is sensitive to the expense of pet health care, and she took extra time to explain the cost along with the pros/cons of each treatment option. And she even asked about one of my dogs, whom she had treated for an infection several months earlier. She has great bedside manner.  There is plenty of parking at the building, the staff is friendly, and there's enough seating in the lobby to keep everyone comfortable. They don't have separate cat and dog entrances, but since we all leash or cage our animals, it doesn't matter. I do like that they have a separate exit away from the entrance, so it's easy to get out without taking a curious dog through the lobby. I highly recommend this practice.

I didn't think I really liked pizza, but since I've done reviews of around 10 pizza places, apparently I do. This one (and its branches at other locations) is the best in the Valley; maybe the best one I've ever visited.  Grimaldi's pizza is fresh, crispy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crusts are all thin, and the sauce is rich but not too sweet. I believe all the ingredients are home-made (I've been told that's true of the pepperoni and cheese too, but even if it's not, the quality is outstanding). They cook the pizzas in a wood oven, and they will get spots of char black on them, but even those are delicious.  My favorite is the pepperoni. They add the sauce on top of the cheese, but it's not too wet -- you could lift a whole slice without it drooping. I've had and enjoyed the sausage, but here the pepperoni is king.  Grimaldi's also has several salads, built in generous portions. Two adults can share a small salad and still have room for pizza. The Mediterranean salad is outstanding, with black olives, tomatoes, and feta in a creamy vinaigrette dressing. I also like the Caprese, but don't get it often since Brak would rather have something with lettuce and not so many tomatoes. The house salad is also good, but doesn't beat the other two.  Plan for a wait at this location, unless you arrive at an odd hour. They can accommodate groups, but you'll have to call ahead. It's not uncommon for us to have to wait 30 or more minutes for a table for two even on a week night, but it's worth the wait, and there is plenty to walk around and see on the side streets.  Parking is plentiful in the lot south of Dillards. The bathrooms are clean, there is outdoor seating if you want it, and overall Grimaldi's is a great experience.

Worst "Japanese" ever. There was one other couple in the place, but it still took almost 20 minutes for this fast food fiasco.  They cook the food right at the counter, which helped me understand how it got so bad. The main issues were that the grill was both encrusted in grease (not in a my-grill-is-finally-seasoned way but in a this-gunk-is-sticking-to-everything way) and was set at far too high a heat. My chicken seared immediately to the grill and the cook had to scrape it off in order to turn it. In the end, the meat was shredded and stringy.  There were four or five sauce options; I asked what one with an odd name tasted like, but the employees have apparently never tried it (and one confided that he had never eaten there). Too bad for me, I didn't get the hint when I was ordering so I stuck around for the food. Never again.

I love Bergies Coffee house. It's a favorite Saturday morning stop as I'm running errands. This old house is tucked between Joe's BBQ and a rental equipment place in downtown Gilbert; don't blink or you'll miss it.  The building is a bit odd and looks like it might be rickety from the outside, but inside it's homey and welcoming. The staff is always superb, and I've never had a bad or wrong order. Mochas, chai lattes, and plain coffee have always been good.  There is plenty of parking behind Bergies, and a lot of outside space to sit in the shaded garden area. It's a great place for some quiet time.

I have a love-hate relationships with Red Bird Cafe. Brak and I keep returning (including this morning), and I like it enough to really hope they are successful. But they have some rough edges.  The service is typically good. There was a new waitress today (Brak: "Uh, oh."), but she was just fine. Everyone who has served us there has been friendly and attentive.  There are about eight tables inside and four or five outside. It's a simple diner: clean, airy, and generally quiet (though the TV sometimes blares).  The food is good, for what it is. I no longer eat meat or eggs, so the menu is a challenge. The breakfast potatoes are excellent, with the potatoes in bite-sized cubes and fried with green pepper and onions. When I did have omelets there (veggie ones), they were light,  perfectly cooked, and not too cheesy. Today I ordered a side of fruit and got fresh watermelon, cantaloupe (in the rind), and a little bit of fresh strawberry, all of which were good.  I had pancakes in my three previous visits, with a side of berries. The strawberries are fresh, but the blueberries were previously frozen and pretty gross. The pancakes themselves are excellent but plate sized (you order how many you want). Unfortunately, twice I have gotten pancakes with some green pepper and onion attached (a la the potatoes), which was an unwelcome surprised.  I really wish they had some healthy options on their menu. I probably wouldn't eat yogurt either, but how hard is it to have oatmeal? I wrote an email to the owner two weeks ago using the address on the site and asking for oatmeal and telling him about the problem pancakes. He didn't even respond to me (jerk).  If you're looking for a very healthy breakfast, this isn't the place. But if you want a regular eggs and bacon style breakfast, this would be a good choice.

Wow. This is the craziest grocery store I've ever seen.  First, you must consider a visit here an adventure. It is the Big Lots of grocery stores...or better, the Goodwill of grocery stores. It has a lot of stuff, never the same things twice, and you certainly never know what you'll find.  Parking is south of the store; drive through the gates, and go about 100 yards from the street. Carts are outside the building, at the bottom of the ramp.  The first part of your adventure is the frozen meat department. I'm rather picky about freezer burn, so even though I have gotten some good whole frozen chickens here, I must admit I fed them to my dogs (raw food feeders -- this place is fantastic!). You'll also find dairy in this section, but...caveat emptor.  Pass through the hanging strips of clearish rubber to get to another part of the warehouse. The produce is behind the grocery section. I've seen some good berries and lettuce in here, but I've also seen some things that look worse than what you'll normally find in the forgotten bottom drawers of my fridge. It isn't pretty.  The main part of the warehouse is grocery itself -- cans, boxes, bottles. You'll find a lot of scratch and dent products. I've found some great prices on Perrier here, and once in a while I'll find something else that I couldn't possibly get at such a great price at another store.  I believe they take debit cards, cash, and welfare food vouchers. I'm not sure if they take credit cards.

Angel Sweet Gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day. It sits in a small strip in the middle of Mesa Riverview, but if you can find it (west of Logan's), it's worth a stop.  The selection of flavors is large, including a dozen dairy-free fruit flavors that aren't quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the left-hand case. I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).  There isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full. Get a punch card if you live in the area. If you like firemen, this would be a good place to see them hanging out.  =)

I had lunch at the Devil's Advocate today with a few friends. It wasn't terrible, but not great -- mainly because of the food.  The waitress was friendly and took our drink orders quickly, but then disappeared for a long time when we were ready to order food. I think she may have been the only waitress on duty, since she was helping people on the far side of the restaurant area. It was pretty slow, but that's stretching it a little thin.  I ordered a BLT and sweet potato fries. Both sounded good, but didn't look so great when they arrived. The bread was grilled rather than toasted, so it was a little greasy and otherwise limp. I was happy that they served the mayo on the side, though a little cup of mayo is kind of unappealing to see. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, but the bacon was really odd. It was very similar to the kind of bacon you'd get in England, which is to say that it's sort of like Canadian bacon for pizza. Not crisp, greasy, stringy. Yuck. The sweet potato fries were pretty unappealing too. They were hot but limp and not particularly flavorful.  The ambiance and decor was good, so if you're wanting a drink, it probably wouldn't be an issue. I liked the comfy chairs around the bar, and there were TVs everywhere so it'd be a great place for watching sports. (They had a World Cup game on but the broadcast was in Arabic, which makes zero sense to me.)

Thank goodness that the owners decided to revive this beautiful downtown location and turn it into a far better restaurant than the old cafeteria that used this building before.  Il Vinaio is a welcome addition to downtown Mesa. I've visited about a dozen times for breakfast and will continue to be a regular. I haven't had lunch or dinner there yet, but I suspect that the food and service would be consistent with their top-notch breakfast.  The staff is friendly and attentive. After a few visits, it was clear that they recognized us and gave us even warmer welcomes. It seems like they genuinely enjoy their jobs.  I've had the crepes with blueberries and marscapone (only $6 - take that, Crackers) a couple of times. The fruit is fresh and the crepes are perfectly cooked. It's sweet but wonderfully executed.  Lately I've stuck with eggs for breakfast - either the $5 breakfast sandwich on an English muffin with a generous portion of potatoes, or two eggs (I take mine poached, which they do in the traditional style, so no added fat) with potatoes and sausage for about $7. I'm not a fan of potatoes, but I love what they do with them for breakfast. They are oven roasted, slightly crispy, with roasted and almost caramelized onions. The taste is fantastic.  I do have a couple of complaints that I hope the owners will work on: 1) Buy some good (hot) tea options. You are a nice restaurant and should have something other than Lipton plain black. Invest in a variety pack with herbal and green teas, plus Earl Grey. 2) Replace your ceiling vents. They're disturbingly unattractive.

Mafia Mike's isn't the best pizza in the East Valley, but I'm going to give it five stars because it's the best delivery pizza in the area. If you are in the mood for Pizza Hut - Papa Johns - Domino's, you'll be much happier with Mafia Mikes. (If you want five-star eat-in pizza, go to Grimaldi's. I'd give Mafia Mikes three stars on that scale.)  The sauce has good flavor and isn't too sweet, nor does it seem like it was canned. The crust is standard, of medium thickness, and not memorable. I have had both canadian bacon/pineapple and plain old pepperoni, and both were good. The pepperoni was a standout because, unlike so many delivery pizzas, the cheese didn't get coated in a thin layer of orange oil exuding from the meat.  I've also had and enjoyed the side salad, which was a generous portion of what appeared to be romaine (and bibb) lettuce, along with red onions, carrots, and a few other toppings. If you want a bit more than pizza with your meal, I recommend their salads.  On a side note, after ordering not long after they opened, I got a hand-written thank you note with a special offer. It was a nice touch, and I hope this kind of customer service helps them compete in this market.

I forgot how disappointing this local chain is. I won't make this mistake again.  We went on a busy Friday night, when the restaurant was packed. Parking was more plentiful than either of the old locations, but that was probably the last plus of the evening. (Well, not quite -- the bathroom was clean.)  The restaurant is poorly laid out and VERY loud. Every seat was full, making it nearly impossible to hear my boyfriend two feet away. Sitting at a table next to the main pathway along the large dining room wasn't much different from sitting on the edge of the food court in Grand Central Station. If you want to get hit in the back of the head by a half-dozen knock-off purses, this is the place to go. Our waitress was impossible to hear, but she managed to catch our orders. She didn't look us in the eye the whole evening. Her annoyance at this job was absolutely clear, and I don't blame her. The place has a miserable ambiance. I'd hide in the kitchen too.  The salad was fine, though it would have been nice had the waitress had let me speak (to say I wanted to remove the onions) before she started tossing it. The bread was good.  I ordered the Capellini Checca, which was absolutely shameful. This restaurant has decided to take the "cutting corners because we don't care" route that Chef Ramsey sees so often. There was about a cup of water in the bottom of the large bowl of angel hair, and the advertised "fresh roma tomatoes" were actually canned but chopped whole tomatoes. (It's June -- tomatoes are in season, for goodness sake.) It was a flavorless mess of powered garlic, a shard or two of basil, overcooked store pasta, water, and "tomatoes".  You'll be far happier at Olive Garden.

I recently underwent a BBQ metamorphosis. I hated it for as long as I can remember, mainly because I don't like to eat things that make my hands dirty. (As if you don't have your own hang-ups. Sheesh.) Then I discovered ribs.  I recently visited Andrews on my tour of local BBQ eateries. The food is ok but not outstanding, but I'm not impressed with the value.  A full rack of ribs is $20, which is only a dollar less than at Famous Dave's and comes with only one side and a stale white bread dinner roll. The flavor of the meat was good though it was too charred for my liking, as if they hadn't been selling enough to keep them from overcooking (no surprise). But if I'm going to pay Famous Dave's prices, I want a plate and no styrofoam.  The sides weren't memorable, but the building certainly was. It looks like an Arby's that two pre-teens repainted with a couple of cans of barn red, black, and teal paint. Someone obviously put no effort into trying to make this location clean, comfortable, or appealing, so I get why it was empty at 7pm on a Friday night. If Andrew wants to survive in this not-so-great location, he's going to have to up his game.

I saw Ashley's review last night, so Brak and I decided to try Posidon for breakfast this morning. Thank you, Ashley, you were right on the mark.  It was quiet in the restaurant late Sunday morning. The dining room is open and airy, with big windows opening onto what's probably the nicest view on this strip of Main Street. The building is freshly painted in traditional Greek blue and white, and the patio looks like it'll be a great place to relax when it's not 113 degrees.  The staff was very friendly. We met what seemed to be the owners (a husband and wife couple? she handled the dining room, and he was running the kitchen), plus a nice young woman at the counter with whom I chatted for a bit. They had several more staff in the place, as I could see when I peaked through a kitchen window to see someone cleaning the already-clean (and huge) kitchen and someone else making spanakopita.  The food was great! I ordered an inexpensive meat and eggs breakfast. The sausage was good, and the potatoes (made with green pepper and red onions) were excellent, although I prefer mine more crispy. I asked for poached eggs and they made them well, though one of the eggs seemed to get away from them in the water (I hear that swirling the water and having enough vinegar fixes that, but I've never been successful making poached eggs in water, so I can't complain). The meal also came with bread, and I opted for a traditional English muffin. They matched our orders correctly, and the food was all really good. Two big breakfasts with drinks: less than $11.00!  The meal was so inexpensive and I was pretty curious about the rest of the menu, so I ordered some Greek coffee half-way through breakfast. I probably had plenty of Greek coffee when I spent a month in Athens, but that was15 years ago and I couldn't remember what to expect. In any case, it's vary similar to Turkish coffee. That is, it's a single portion made by adding finely ground coffee and sugar to boiling water (rather than hot water passed through chunkier American-style grounds). I ordered mine medium (in sweetness), and it was fantastic. I stopped drinking coffee years ago but I used to love this form of coffee; I'll definitely come back for more. Note that it is supposed to have a layer of sludge at the bottom of the cup -- don't drink it, unless you really like the taste of the grounds. They also have frappe on the menu, which is a blended, foamy, sweetened iced Nescafe-style coffee common in Greek cuisine.  We hung out at the table for a while as I had coffee and worked on some paperwork. The waitress surprised us by bringing us a small plate of baklava. It was perfectly browned and crispy on the top and sweetened well (i.e., not too much, which I like). I didn't taste the filling (I'm allergic to nuts), but Brak said it was good.  The restaurant has a shop attached (with a very cool blue piano at the entrance), so we walked around a bit. They have a variety of canned and dried goods, including an aisle of spices. The real gems in the shop are the wide variety of cheeses (including a smooth goat cheese you won't find at Whole Foods or Sprouts) and the items in the frozen case. They have at least five different varieties of phyllo dough, ready to heat gyro meat, and several sizes (from individual to family) of traditional Greek dishes that look like they were made and packaged in the restaurant. I bought a single-portion of frozen meat Moussaka (they also have vegetarian) for $5.50.   I also got a small portion of hot Avgolemeno soup (cream of chicken and rice flavored with lemon) from the restaurant to take home. I certainly didn't need it after a big breakfast and baklava, but it's a wonderful traditional soup that I haven't seen in years. I tasted it, and it was delicious. Because of the service, the food, and especially this soup, I plan to be a regular at Posidon.

Artie just left, after having replaced my leaky garbage disposal and taking a crack at my clogged bathroom sink. He is top-notch in speed, quality (so far), and cleanliness. Plus, he was a generally nice guy that I felt comfortable having in my house.  I had suspected that the disposal was the problem when I called, so I asked if I should buy one in advance just in case. He told me exactly what other parts I needed to get (who knew they don't come with power cords?), so the job went quickly and easily.  He also tried to get to a clog in my rear bathroom sink. His snaking tools couldn't go beyond a bend deep in the wall to get to the clog. He was extremely nice and gave me advice about next steps, including a way to find a trustworthy service company to do the advanced rooting work.  I have no regrets calling Artie. His pricing was reasonable ($70 for the work, done in an hour), he was very professional. I'd call him again and definitely recommend him to friends.

I got a rock chip in my windshield and knew my AAA insurance would sent me to Safelite. So mid-morning in the middle of a week, I dropped in at this location.   The receptionist is fast and friendly. She had a tech check the damage and confirm it could be fixed. Before I realized he had even seen my car, he was in the lobby explaining the damage, the fix, and the guarantee.   I called the insurance company, got the ok, and within five minutes they were fixing the chip. My wait was short and not unpleasant. The waiting room was clean and comfortable; it's a better place to wait than my doctor offers.   The fix was done well. I would definitely recommend this location, and I'll come back.

Best lunch spot in the area. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The staff has always been friendly and never messed up an order. I wish I had bought into this business, because they are going to be very successful.  I've done eat-in and pick-up lunches several times. It can get a little busy on weekdays around noon, but I've never had to wait long for my meal.  On my first visit, I ordered the grilled veggie sandwich with a side of fruit. It was so good that I have ordered it every other visit, plus I bought my own panini grill for home so I can have the Urban Picnic-style sandwich for dinner once in a while. (Unfortunately, they're open only for breakfast and lunch, six days a week.)  I highly recommend Urban Picnic and hope to try it for breakfast soon.

I tend to avoid chain breakfast joints, but last month Brak and I had a great experience with an IHOP in Roswell, NM. So good, in fact, that we went twice on that trip. So when I suggested a visit to the new local IHOP this morning, he was agreeable.  What a mistake. Our first frustration was the noise-levels in the waiting area. The music (include radio DJ chit-chat) was so loud that the hostess had to walk from group to group and repeat the customer name in almost a shout in hopes of figuring out whose table was ready. I asked her to turn down the music, but she gave me a puzzled look and said "What? What?"  We were seated within a few minutes, but our table wasn't exactly ready. It had pools of water on the seats and the table itself. Even after the hostess's attempt at drying it off, there was water still pooled around the condiments after we had finished eating. Perhaps this is the source of Mesa's mosquito problem.  The food itself was standard and not bad. I had a short stack of buttermilk pancakes, which were good but not memorable. Our waitress was pleasant, but she had to talk to us in such a loud voice (over the music, still bad in the dining area, and now also the loud talk of the customers trying to hear one another) -- basically I had a hard time not feeling like she was yelling at me.  Twice during our short meal waitstaff came out of the kitchen to sing for a customer's birthday. It was singing, I think, but my ears were ringing too much to know because the waitresses started out the song by walking through the dining area actually shrieking and screaming. It was so awful I can barely describe it. Several people in other booths had their hands over their ears, and one little boy across from me was visibly upset.  On the whole, I think a couple of good lessons can be learned from this experience: -- This new IHOP location hasn't been able to hire a competent manager yet. -- Everything is better in Roswell.  We won't be back.

I decided to make this place my regular spot for nails after trying several other local places. I like this place the best because: - it's a lot cleaner than other area salons - the people are always friendly and seem to recognize their customers - they keep expanding their options, including new colors - there is enough going on that I can stay entertained while sitting through the hour-long process of getting a gel manicure - the prices are competitive with other local salons  I've never had a bad service and I highly recommend this salon.

A first impression is worth so much...  After months of waiting for a local Italian restaurant to open in the site of the old Rigatony's and Mardenaley's, we were eager to check out Cucina Di Venti on its second night in business. The building was absolutely spruced up both inside and out.  It was apparent within a couple minutes of our arrival that the owners have never operated a restaurant -- with clues such as several un-bussed tables and improperly set tables with grimy salt and pepper shakers (on day two of operation! day two!).  They did a few things that made me wonder if they've ever BEEN to a restaurant, such as handing out the (nearly indecipherable who-chose-this-font) menus in the lobby area and making us carry them as we followed the hostess who wandered through several half-full rooms and asked if we could see a place to sit...in a white-table-cloth, linen-napkin restaurant...one that charges North Scottsdale prices...it was a bit of a shock.  On a positive note, the food was fine. I had to send my order to back to the kitchen because my "no cheese" request wasn't followed, but the cappellini pomodoro was quite good. Unfortunately my partner couldn't wait for my new plate to arrive because his lasagna wasn't hot enough to endure a delay. They were kind enough to comp us dessert because of the mistake, though the tiramisu arrived just after I started the pasta and was really just "eh".  The staff was very friendly and clearly trying hard. Our server will probably be a good one when she's had more than two days' experience. I enjoyed having her at our table, though moreso because it was a comedy of errors rather than an excellent customer service experience.  I'd like to see this restaurant survive. The neighborhood needs something in that location and an Italian place is most welcome. However, if they hope to survive 6 months they'll need to make better first impressions. My suggestion is that the owners hire a couple of career-waitress crones from a local diner who know basic restaurant operations and will whip the staff into line (and tell the owners what they need to hear). Then they should lower their prices to align with their customer demographic.  We'll come back in a couple of months to see if they've learned some lessons. Until then, I'll keep my fingers crossed.

The Uprooted Kitchen food truck parked at the Gilbert Farmers Market today. I hope they come back every week.   Unlike the several other food trucks that have visited and quickly given up at the farmers market, Uprooted Kitchen seems to understand two important points: 1) people want to eat breakfast (not dinner) at 8am, and 2) farmers markets are visited by people who like to eat plant-based food and not only meat-focused dishes.  The truck offers a vegetarian and vegan menu that would appeal to eaters of all types. The had oatmeal, granola, and quinoa bowls with fruit, a tofu scramble, and a variety of breakfast and dessert baked goods.   I tried the quinoa, which was warmed and served with cinnamon and fruit (kiwi, plums, berries). I loved it. It had a bit of coconut milk added but almond milk was also available.   On the side was a blueberry scone. At first I was a little put off because it was cold and not dry like the scones I've had elsewhere, but one bite reversed my impression. It was delicious.  I'd probably never track down a food truck, but if I see them again, I'll stop for a meal. And if we're really lucky, they'll get the Bergies coffee stand to set up next to them at future markets.

I like this corner coffee shop. It's a good place to get some work done (free wifi) or relax. The coffee is excellent, with $1 refills. The two staff members were very pleasant.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which was good. I do like that they include tomatoes and spinach, but it's odd that the baby spinach was raw. Still, the taste was good -- the assembly just seemed a bit disjointed.  Things I didn't expect to see: Hot food (breakfast until 10:30). Pool table. Scoop ice cream. Fruit smoothies. Creepy mannequin.  This place would deserve 5 stars, but I'm knocking one off because the other reviewer was right: it's bad business not to have at least one inside table that someone in a wheelchair can use.

Too bad Yelp only lets us award five stars. I'd go higher if I could.  My tub and bathroom sink were both draining slowly, so I gave them a call. Ryan picked up the phone immediately, we scheduled for later in the day, and then he called back to say he could arrive even earlier.   Both Ryan and his partner Brian showed up, since my description of the issue lead them to think they'd be clearing a main line, a two person job. Luckily, it wasn't such a big problem, and they fixed it quickly and well. Since my particular situation could have resulted in some damage to either the tub or a wall, they talked options and costs before starting, answering all my questions along the way.  I learned two things: (1) The plumber I had in my bathroom for a clog on the same tub and sink two years ago missed a few things. There was a problem with how my sink facet was installed, and it was always going to drain slower than it should (they had the parts, replaced the guts, problem solved).  (2) I should be doing maintenance on my 60 year-old home's pipes with a bio enzyme, to eat the junk that slips down the drain and builds up inside the pipes. They recommended a product that was easy to find on Amazon.  Their price was very reasonable, they cleaned up after themselves, and they let my dog hang out with them to supervise. In the end, they fixed both problems and didn't leave any damage. Although this company is less than a year old, these plumbers obviously have much more experience. I'll recommend Second Opinion Plumbing to all my friends.

We stopped by to discover this new sports bar-style location opened in the last few days. The pizza was great (Brak had sausage and I stuck with cheese).   The bar sits in the middle of the dining room, with plenty of bar seating and at least 20 booths and tables nearby. They've taken the sports bar label seriously; with all the TVs, this would be a good place to watch the game.   They are staffed up and don't seem to be held back with opening issues. Don't forget to ask for pie cut.
