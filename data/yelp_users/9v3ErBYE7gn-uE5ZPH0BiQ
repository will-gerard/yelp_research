Dr. Frank Caserta is an extremely professional, knowledgable, gracious, and STELLAR eye surgeon. He has taken very good care of my eyes for years, and did my Mothers cataract surgeries with precision and explained everything to her until she was satisfied. There is not another Doctor in town I would trust my eyes with, and everyone I have recommended to him, has been nothing but happy. It is a busy office, and there may be some delays, but it is well worth the wait. He is top notch!

Cosmos is the premier salon in the Valley...at least if you ask me. Allison is professional, creative, smart, and has a knack for hearing what you say, and giving you the cut and color you want. She is friendly, and always tries her hardest to get you an appointment when you want it. The girls up front are usually friendly(but Allison schedules her own appointments so I don't deal with them often) There is NEVER an upsale on products, which I appreciate. When Allison had her baby, I saw Morgan..who is also a talented stylist, and got me an appointment within a few short days. The owners, Cosmos and Sandra have always been friendly, and knowledgable about their products. The cost I believe depends on the stylists skills. I find it to be reasonable, and I ALWAYS get compliments. I can honestly say if Allison moved...I might have to move in with her!! LOL I drive all the way to Mesa, from 32nd street and Camelback every month...that should speak volumes. I believe you will be happy with your experience. Try it out!

I've been going to Joanna for all of my tailoring needs for several years now. She does a fantastic job. Her prices are reasonable, and her work is excellent!

I live in this neighborhood, and regularly do my workouts around the loop. It is 2 miles, and filled with gorgeous homes, and views of the mountains. It is perfect for interval training, or just a nice stroll. It is a neighborhood so be respectful.

This is the second time I have used paradise carpet cleaning. George is a  very nice guy, who does an amazing job on carpets. I couldn't move the beds in my home, and he was kind enough to help when he got here. I absolutely recommend you use him for your carpets. I am 100% confident you will have NO regrets. Just bummed that where I am moving next, I will not be able to use his services. :((

Had my first appointment with Elizabeth today, and it turned out beautiful and just how I wanted it. She is friendly, talented, and is very good at explaining why something will or will not work well on your hair. I am 110% pleased, and will be making her my go to stylist from here on out.

Do not try to return a product here, it will be a nightmare experience. Even the employees whisper to you about how difficult the owner (the bald man) is. He blames it all on YOU, it is NEVER the product or how it was made, or his error, or just a random problem with a product. He treats people poorly. LOVE what you buy, and if there is an issue with it....learn to live with it, or be blamed for it. Please believe me when i say this...Its a bummer.

First time visit tonight, and it was fantastic! I went with my Mom, and I ordered the chicken breast w/ roasted veggies. It was absolutely outstanding, perfectly cooked with lovely vegetables. Mom had the pasta, and although I cannot recall which one it was, it was delicious. Daniel personally greeted us, and then checked with us to see how our food was. The service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was comfortable , with a gorgeous view of Squaw Peak. I will be back for sure.

If you don't eat here...you need your head examined. I seriously think I touched a little slice of heaven as I shoved the fork in my mouth...over and over and over again. I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could keep ordering, and eating. Its so delicious, and I want to go back every single day...and sadly, tomorrow is Sunday, and they are closed. I guess if they bring you to Heaven, they also deserve a day of rest. Amen!  EAT HERE, I PROMISE, You Will Love It.

Sat at the bar this afternoon, and enjoyed my stay. The gentleman who work the bar are great guys from Chicago.....they bust their butts, and are 110% polite and friendly. The pizza was excellent, I had the personal size, Lou's. I couldnt have asked for a better experience. Keep up the great work, I will be back. :)

I don't get it. The service was poor, and the food was average, and unoriginal. The only reason I gave two stars was for the sourdough bread, and homemade preserves. Very subpar on every level. One more thing, could you spare a plate? The size of the plate my eggs were served on was like a saucer....Seriously, my eggs were hanging over the side. You have to wash a plate regardless, at least serve it on a plate where I won't be afraid if I cut them they will fall off the plate.

First timer tonight, and I was impressed. I am allergic to the protein in beef, and pork so I obviously wasn't coming for the burgers. I have had a million chicken sandwiches, and turkey in every way possible, and they all usually taste the same...eh! I ordered the Chicken Shack, and it was excellent! The buttermilk/mayo combo sauce was what really made it special. It was put together in the proper order, and the bun was excellent. The crispness was just perfect. I added some of the hot sauce that was available (Louisiana hot sauce) and it was perfection. There was a guy who was answering questions and handing out menus while we were waiting in line...and he was so nice, polite, funny, and an asset to the Shake Shack company. I didn't catch his name, but he was working March 9th, 2016 at approx the 7:00p.m hour. Keep him. I will definitely be back. Im eager to try the custard, which I hear is excellent ( recommended by the guy with the menus) Yay, welcome to Arizona. :)
