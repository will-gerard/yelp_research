This is by far our favorite sushi place... we've been to many, but the value and freshness you receive here is outstanding. Plus, it's always fast, which we love! All we order are rolls and nothing we've tried is bad.

We used to really like the food here so decided to try it again, especially since we found online where kids eat free. There was a little bit of a hassle when we got the check, but ended up getting that removed. However, we were still charged for our kid's drinks when the menu specifically said they were included with the meals. The antipasto salad we got was not filled with "meats" as described, but rather a small portion of only pepperoni and the dressing had an unusual after taste. The alfredo sauce was real bland, chicken parmesan too thin and mainly breading. When we reached out to the manager, never heard a word back so obviously customer service isn't such a priority here. We will never go back.

I would like to say that as a Real Estate Broker and Investor for many years, I've dealt with many painting contractors during that time. When it came time to repaint the exterior of our "forever" home we just bought, it had to be perfect.  We received several quotes from painters I've had experience with before, but this was my first time for Crash of Rhinos. I saw all the online reviews and was a little skeptical, but wanted to have them out. Mike was great at the initial walk and the price was very reasonable for the quality we were going to get.   My personal business is very customer service oriented and that's exactly how Mike, Kim and crew work also. They were responsive throughout the process and did everything they said they would do.  When it came time for the actual work to begin, the crew showed up on time every day, didn't leave a giant mess, prep work was outstanding and they were very thorough when it came time for touch ups. One of the guys accidentally broke one of our exterior lights, but immediately brought it to my attention and they bought a replacement and installed no questions asked.  I would HIGHLY recommend Crash of Rhinos painting to anyone looking for great service and quality, while still at a fair price. They are backed up with scheduling for a reason, but it'll be worth the wait! I plan to use them on other projects now moving forward.

We love Tokyo Lobby just down the street, but after reading others' reviews, wanted to try this place and am glad we did. It was very good. The Happy Hour all day long everyday is my type of place. We had 4 rolls and all were very good... our kids had the teriyaki chicken and my wife thought the chicken was so tender she'd order some next time too. Very small and not fancy, but that doesn't matter to us. We will be back for sure.
