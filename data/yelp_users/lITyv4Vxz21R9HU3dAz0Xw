Mocha Rush Frost. Do it.     I don't even drink coffee (I don't like the taste), but I stole a sip of my husband's once and was addicted from then on.  There's an okay selection of teas, but it's not their area of expertise.  The baristas are always friendly and they know how to make a good drink quickly.    This location has plenty of patio seating right next to a beautiful "lake, "  though I actually prefer the other location's gorgeous plant-filled patio.  I thought they used to have a collection of board and card games you could borrow during your visit, but last time we were there (in May after having moved out of state 2+ years ago), I didn't see any.  Big bonus: free wifi.  And it still maintains a pretty decent speed even when everyone's on it.

I used to live in Central Phoenix and loved Flavors of India.  Since moving to Mesa, I just hadn't seen or found a good replacement until I tried The Dhaba.    The service was a little slow at times, but the overall atmosphere was friendly and inviting.  The food came out hot and was flavorful, with a hint of spice, and delicious.  Both the plain and garlic naan were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside, the perfect combination.  There is also a small, but decent, selection of Indian beer.  And though the food came out in what appeared to be somewhat small dishes, we had enough leftovers to take home and make another meal.

An outstanding experience all around.  My husband and I moved to WA and we have some friends who rent our town home in Mesa.  Some repairs had built up and my tenants just didn't get good vibes from the first handyman service I had out for a quote, so I called up Duane.  When I explained the issues going on, he said he'd want to look at them first hand, but they sounded like simple fixes.  Talking to Duane was a pleasure and he followed up with my tenants right away to make an appointment that fit their schedule.  And you know what? All the issues were simple fixes.  The other handyman service wanted us to replace a whole ceiling fan unit because the light pull cord was broken (pulling the cord did nothing) though the light and fan still worked.  Duane simply changed out the light pull switch...  And when he pulled the part out to fix it and realized it didn't have the right one with him, he ran over to Ace Hardware so he could finish the job the same day. He also looked at our side gate and tightened up some loose hardware that was becoming problematic.    I think my tenant sums it up nicely: "He was awesome.  Very intelligent.  Seriously, if I ever have anything break any where I live, I hope this guy is around!"

Edit - I bumped up from one to two stars - adding a star for Eli's attentiveness to my issues, which I really appreciate and which gives testament to the positive experiences other folks have described.  Eli has personally contacted me through a Yelp message to follow up on the issues I've described. I've edited the original review to include his responses in the appropriate places.  Ultimately though, I still have to rely on the feedback of my tenants, who were just not comfortable with the experience they had.  And since I cannot be there in person to handle these things myself, I must rely on their judgment.    Original Review: I am so disappointed I didn't get the five star experience most seem to enjoy from Eli.    My husband and I moved to WA and are renting our town home in Mesa to some friends and a few repair jobs had built up.  I first tried calling Eli and after the phone rang like 20 times, there was finally a voicemail I could leave a message on...for a minute I was worried I had the wrong number since it rang so long.  **edit: Eli has said this has been addressed so that when they cannot answer the line due to attending other issues, like repairs, it will be picked up by voicemail earlier.** I then realized I had accidentally switched two digits when leaving my phone number in the message so I followed up with an email.  I got an email reply from Eli fairly quickly - a promising sign - confirming he got my messages and that he would be contacting our tenants to set up an appointment in order to take a look at the issues and get us a quote.  According to my tenants, the guy who showed up appeared to have no idea how to address the issues I had outlined.  The light pull cord on one of the upstairs ceiling fans was broken (it no longer responded to pulling) but the light and the fan still worked.  This guy's solution? Replace the entire ceiling fan.  Uh, what?  If you Google this issue it's a fairly easy repair to the pull switch inside the light cover (which is exactly what the handyman we ended up hiring did).  **edit: Eli says the guy did indicate the pull switch could be replaced but suggested replacing the entire fan because it was older and this was outlined in the quote.  Unfortunately, this is not what my tenants understood from their conversation with him and I did not receive the quote.**   The guy was also supposed to look at the side gate as the hardware had become loose.  He didn't even look at this.  **edit: Eli says the man he send out did look at a rolling shield door that covers the glass sliding door leading out to the patio.  This was not in the service request as we already had someone from the Roll-A-Shield company scheduled to come look at it.  This could have been a mix-up on the tenant's part, but my email request did specifically mention the side gate on the patio, not a rolling shield door. Eli says the quote would have recommended us contacting the Roll-A-Shield company for this issue, so I do appreciate them recognizing repairs outside their skill set and giving proper referrals.**  It has been over a week since the guy was out there and I have yet to hear anything from Eli or anyone else regarding the quote I requested.  **edit: Eli says he did email me the quote a few days after the guy was out there, but I cannot find it. It may have been swept up by my spam filter or Eli said its always possible they accidentally  misspelled my email address when sending it out.**  Since my tenants did not get good vibes from this house call, I contacted another handyman service for a second opinion and the guy has already been out, given me a quote, and done the repairs for a really good price.

I'm happy to report we had no problems with our Payless Car Rental experience.  And I was really worried about it after reading the other reviews.  I didn't get any super hard sells for the additional insurance and coverages, but I was pretty firm up front I wasn't taking them.  The employees, though not overly friendly, did their job and I got my car quickly.  It was frustrating that I made the reservation under my husband's name so they made him the primary driver and wouldn't switch it to me (I could only add myself as an additional driver for $10/day).  I mean, how hard is that to do? I didn't want two drivers, I just wanted the primary to be me.  So, be careful when making your reservation.  Other than that, the car was in good, but not great condition, with lots of several nicks and scratches we had to mark down.  But it got us where we needed to go at a super cheap daily rental rate.  I was charged exactly what I was quoted when I booked through Alaska Airlines/Orbitz booking.  I'll be using them again when I'm back in October.
